", "I.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Sri Lanka recognizes the need for enhanced project management \ncapacity  for  agencies  implementing  large-scale  infrastructure  projects,  particularly  foreign-\nfunded projects.1 Government staff engaged in project implementation experience complex \nimplementation  challenges  and  may  not  have  been  trained  fully  in  up-to-date  project \nmanagement methods. The draft Sri Lanka country operations business plan indicates a total \nlending  envelope for  2014\u20132016  of  $1.07  billion.2 The  plan  also  proposes to  introduce  a \nnonlending  program  to  blend  hard  infrastructure  with  soft  interventions  such  as  capacity \ndevelopment. This $0.5 million capacity development technical assistance (TA) will introduce \nand implement targeted capacity development programs. The TA will provide direct support to \nstrengthen  the  project  management  and  administration  capacity  of  government  staff \nundertaking ADB-funded projects. The TA will (i) enhance the  project management capabilities \nof project management unit (PMU) staff by conducting training programs and workshops on \nproject management and contract management in the water, energy, transport, and education \nsectors; (ii) introduce best project management practices supported by information technology \n(IT) tools in water sector projects, while ensuring the compatibility of the proposed project \nmanagement system with the existing national project monitoring system; and (iii) upgrade the \ntechnical skills of the staff of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) working \non  the  Greater  Colombo  Water  and  Wastewater  Management  Improvement  Investment \nProgram which includes non-revenue water (NRW) reduction program.3 \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 identifies capacity development as a driver of change that provides \nADB with an opportunity to be a supportive development partner.4 In June 2010, a project \nimplementation working group was established with a mandate to identify key issues and good \npractices  that  could  be  applied  widely  across  ADB  to  improve  project  implementation.5 \nEnsuring effective project implementation by the implementing agencies was identified as one \nof the main recommendations. This TA will respond to this issue and will support and enhance \nproject management skills for key sectors. The government concurs with the impact, outcome, \noutput, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of references \nfor consultants. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  ADB\u2019s portfolio in Sri Lanka comprises primarily water, energy, transport, and education \nprojects. These sectors account for 84% of ADB\u2019s ongoing lending in the country. It is important \nfor these projects to have effective project management capacity supported by efficient IT-\nbased systems. Robust IT tools are also useful to ensure better information sharing among the \ngovernment  agencies  and  development  partners.  Capacity  enhancement  for  contract \nmanagement is essential for overall project management capacity improvement. \n \n4.  Project executing and implementing agencies must report project implementation status \nto ADB and various government organizations including the Department of Project Management \n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) now supports 28 projects through 48 ongoing loans and grants with a net \nloan amount of $2.4 billion. In 2012, ADB approved four new loans for $352 million to Sri Lanka. \n2  ADB. Forthcoming.  Country Operations Business Plan: Sri Lanka, 2014\u20132016. Manila. \n3   ADB. 2012.

Many executing and \nimplementing agencies lack appropriate IT tools for project management. This situation can \ncompromise effective fund allocation and efficient project progress monitoring, which in turn \nmay  adversely  impact  project  implementation.  Providing  field  staff  with  specialized  project \nmanagement knowledge and equipping them with advanced IT application skills will ensure \nmore effective and timely implementation, including early resolution of claims under bidding \ncontract packages and other contractual matters.  \n \n5.  The  technically  complex  nature  of  water  projects  makes  contract  management \nchallenging. Water projects, including the recently approved multitranche financing facility for \nthe Greater Colombo Water and Wastewater Management Improvement Investment Program, \ninvolve implementing technically complex construction components (footnote 3). Evaluation of \nbidding documents calls for evaluators to have a good knowledge of procurement systems as \nwell  as  technical  requirements,  which  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  quality  of  bidders\u2019 \nproposal.  Furthermore, design  change  is  sometimes required  under  a  contract  to manage \nevolving situations, including social issues associated with the physical interventions. The TA \nwill provide technical support to the government  PMUs in the water sector with NRW reduction \nexpertise  and  IT  -  based  project  management  tools  to  enhance  technical  and  project \nmanagement capacity.  \n \n6.  The technical complexity of energy and transport operations also necessitates capacity \nenhancement for effective project management. Energy projects have many subcomponents \nthat cover large geographical areas, and each of these may have its own responsible project \noffice. Transport projects have experienced major contractual disputes with contractors, and this \ntrend is increasing across the Asia and Pacific region.6 IT-based project management tools can \nprovide early warning of possible implementation difficulties, and ensure that measures are \ntaken to avoid escalation of any dispute. In addition, staff needs to have a sound knowledge of \nthe contract conditions and contract management procedures of the Federation of Consulting \nEngineers  (FIDIC)  and  the  Institute  of  Construction  and  Training  Development  (ICTAD). \nScheduling information for contract implementation needs to be shared with contractors and the \nDPMM. Efficient IT-based project management tools will ensure effective exchange of contract \nand project information, and will improve coordination among project offices.  \n \n7.  Education projects usually have numerous small contracts for education facilities. These \ncontracts are managed by government officials in local and provincial government organizations \nwho have limited knowledge of project management. In addition, the newly approved Education \nSector  Development  Program  requires  achievement  of  results  indicators  prior  to \ndisbursements.7 Therefore, it is essential to provide training and capacity building opportunities \nto cover deficiencies in project and contract management. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact of the TA will be enhanced operational effectiveness of ADB-funded projects \nin Sri Lanka.  \n                                                \n6  During contract implementation, contractual disputes occur due to changes in (i) physical component design; (ii) \nconstruction site handover  schedule; (iii) market conditions such as unavailability of critical construction materials; \nand (iv) project completion, due to delay associated with any or all of the incidents described. \n7   ADB. 2013.

Manila. ", "  3 \n \n \n9.  The TA\u2019s outcome will be satisfactory implementation of projects in full compliance with \nADB guidelines. The NWSDB, DPMM, MOFP and relevant agencies and ministries will have \nenhanced capacity in project implementation. \n \n10.  The TA outputs are as follows: \n \n(i)  Enhanced knowledge of government project staff in various aspects of project \nmanagement. The government\u2019s move away from the dedicated PMU system demands \nenhanced project management capacity for the government staff working on project \nimplementation. The TA will provide support to (a) build capacity and improve skills in \nproject management in the water sector as a key sector, which will be replicated to other \nsectors; (b) train project staff to have sound knowledge of FIDIC and ICTAD conditions \nof contract and enhanced knowledge on contract management; (c) enhance skills of key \nimplementing agencies in complex project structuring, bid packaging, bidding document \npreparation,  and  bid  evaluation;  and  acquire  required  knowledge  of  procurement \nsystems  and  technical  requirements;  and  (d)  develop  a  contract  management  and \nproject management manual to ensure sustainability of an efficient project management \nsystem. \n   \n(ii)  Project management staff in the water sector apply best project management \npractices  supported  with  information  technology  tools.  On  a  pilot  basis,  the \nknowledge-building activities for project management staff in ADB-funded water projects \nwill be complemented with appropriate IT tools and IT training in consultation with the \nInformation and Communication Technology Agency. To ensure sustainability of the \nexpertise developed, program participants will be required to have advanced knowledge \nand skills in IT. An IT system application manual (a specific system user guide) for the \nwater sector will be developed to allow replication of the system to other priority sectors \nsuch as energy, roads, and education. The specialized project management knowledge \nand  advanced  IT  system  application  skills  will  ensure  more  effective  and  timely \nimplementation of project activities, including early resolution of conflicting issues on \nbidding packages and other contractual matters. It will also ensure (a) sharing of the \ntime schedule information for contract implementation with the contractors, the DPMM, \nand the External Resources Department (ERD) of the MOFP; (b) efficient exchange of \ncontract and project information with ADB; (c) early warning of any disputes and the \nintroduction of measures to avoid escalation; and (d) coordination among project offices \nin projects with multiple subcomponents.  \n \n(iii)  Staff  of  the  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board  are  equipped  with \nimproved  technical  skills  for  the  NRW  reduction  program. NRW project design \nrequires extensive and advanced engineering knowledge on hydrology, water resources \nmanagement, drinking water quality, leak detection, and water treatment and distribution \nsystems. The TA will provide support to the NWSDB to gain the required NRW expertise, \ntraining, and capacity enhancement, which were not available to project staff in the past. \nThis activity will be replicated in other ADB-financed water projects.  \n \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n \n \n ", "4 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n  \n11.  The  TA  will  provide  support  to  (i)  enhance  project  management  skills  and  train \ngovernment project staff on project management and contract management for ADB-funded \nprojects in the water, energy, transport, and education sectors; (ii) train the trainers of the \ngovernment project staff to ensure sustainability of training courses developed under the TA; (iii) \ndevelop a contract management and project management manual; (iv) enhance current project \nmanagement  systems  through  the  use  of  effective  IT  project  management  software8 and \nprovision  of  additional  hardware;  (v)  support  the  DPMM  and  the  MOFP  ERD  project \nmanagement system while ensuring the compatibility of proposed systems with the existing \nnational contract monitoring system implemented by the DPMM through the Integrated National \nDevelopment Information System; and (vi) provide technical support for the NRW reduction \nprogram for Colombo City by recruiting consultants to (a) provide overall NRW knowledge \nexchange to the staff for the NRW program, (b) provide expertise to the government project staff \nto update the network model of the existing water supply network, and (c) support institutional \nreforms and training for NRW reduction and software application for water supply network \nmodeling.9  \n \n12.  This TA will also support the planning and project management support for the proposed \nactivities  to  be  carried  out  at  the  national  level  under  the  Education  Sector  Development \nProgram (footnote 7). This TA will not replicate activities being carried out under other TA \nprojects in the education sector.10  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $554,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, office supplies, taxes, \nand other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The executing agency is ADB, which will be supported closely by the DPMM. The TA will \nbe implemented over 18 months from the fielding of consultants in February 2014, with physical \ncompletion  by  May  2015  and  TA  completion  by  June  2015.  The  TA  will  conduct  regular \nconsultative meetings with all stakeholder agencies, including the National Planning Department, \nthe DPMM, the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage, the NWSDB, and the ERD, as required. \nAll consultants will be recruited in consultation with the MOFP.  \n \n15.  The TA will engage individual consultants to provide 20 person-months of consulting \nservices: 8.5 person-months of international consulting services and 11.5 person-months of \nnational  consulting  services.
