THE ENSUING INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \n1.  The proposed multitranche financing facility (MFF) for the Rajasthan Secondary Towns \nDevelopment Investment Program (RSTDIP) will complement past and ongoing efforts of the \nGovernment of Rajasthan (GOR) to improve infrastructure, management, and performance of \nurban services to 2.5 million residents of Rajasthan.1 The RSTDIP will help reduce nonrevenue \nwater (NRW); provide 24x7 water supply; and expand the drainage and sewerage network, \nincluding fecal sludge management and decentralized wastewater systems, in Jaipur, the capital \ncity, and 37 secondary towns in Rajasthan. The impact of the RSTDIP will be productivity, \nlivability, and prosperity for the residents of Rajasthan improved.2 The outcome will be urban \nservice delivery in Jaipur and secondary towns of Rajasthan improved. The RSTDIP is estimated \nto cost $715 million with the MFF amount of $500 million to be provided in two equal tranches. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n2.  The transaction technical assistance (TRTA) will help the GOR prepare the proposed \ninvestment program. The TRTA will carry out due diligence on technical, economic, financial, \ngovernance, safeguards, gender, poverty, social, natural hazard and climate resilience aspects \nfor the ensuing investment program. Assisting the target secondary towns along the capital city, \nJaipur,  is  an  integral  part  of  investment  program  preparation,  without  which  the  program \nimplementation may face significant start-up delays. The TRTA is synchronized to maximize \nknowledge transfer and suggest the ways to suitably coordinate with ongoing and other proposed \nprojects in water and wastewater sectors in Rajasthan.  \n \n3.  The TRTA will enhance project readiness by assisting the GOR in undertaking advance \nactions, including identification of lands for project facilities. The GOR has taken advance actions \nof preparing detailed project reports (DPRs) and bidding documents for the subprojects under the \nRSTDIP. The TRTA will assist in the preparation of a sector assessment, road maps, and \ninvestment plan, and a pre-feasibility study for future projects. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n4.
