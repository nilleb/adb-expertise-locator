THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nand a proposed grant, both to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Green and Resilient Affordable \nHousing  Sector  Project.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \nSupporting the Green and Resilient Affordable Housing Sector Project, and if the Board approves \nthe proposed loan and grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe TA. \n \n2.  The project will support the government\u2019s national priority to improve the livability, safety, \nand sustainability of human settlements through better access to adequate and affordable rental \nhousing,1 which will be implemented using the sector loan modality. The project will increase the \nsupply of green and resilient affordable housing in Nganglam, Phuentsholing, Samdrup Jongkhar, \nSamtse, Thimphu, and Trashiyangtse; and benefit about 1,000 lower- to middle-income civil \nservants and non-civil servants, including marginalized municipal waste workers. The project will \nalso implement the associated infrastructure and facilities, enhance the institutional capacity of \nthe National Housing Development Corporation Limited (NHDCL), and strengthen the housing \nsector policy and regulatory framework necessary to provide access to land, and leverage the \nprivate sector to address the housing supply shortage. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Country macroeconomic context. Bhutan is steadily urbanizing. The share of the urban \npopulation increased from 30% in 2005 to 42% in 2021, driven by an average annual growth rate \nof 1.9% over that period. The urbanization rate is projected to reach 56.8% by 2047.2 Urban \npopulation growth is fueled by rural migration, mostly to the four largest urban centers of Gelephu, \nPhuentsholing, Samdrup Jongkhar, and Thimphu, which account for 59.0% of the total urban \npopulation. While 58.0% of the Bhutanese population still lives in rural areas and engages in \nsmall-scale and subsistence agriculture, the constant flow of rural migration to urban centers is \nexerting mounting pressure on urban services. Bhutan has a chance to be proactive and focus \non housing development. Economic growth in the capital city, Thimphu, has been fueled by \nexpansion  in  construction,  services,  and  manufacturing.  Bhutan  has  a  current  overall \nunemployment rate of 2.4%, which is low relative to neighboring South Asia countries.3 The \nGovernment of Bhutan\u2019s Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2018\u20132023 calls for developing the economy by \nfostering growth in the private sector, which will create jobs and contribute to sustainable poverty \nreduction and the country\u2019s transition to green and resilient development (footnote 1).  \n \n4.  Housing demand. Affordable housing development in Bhutan has not kept pace with \npopulation growth, particularly in urban areas where the demographic increase puts pressure on \nthe  limited  usable  and  appropriately  zoned  land  and  pushes  house  prices  up,  making  it \nincreasingly unaffordable. In 2017, the estimated shortfall of housing nationwide was 21,156.4 \n \n1  Government of Bhutan, Gross National Happiness Commission. 2019.

Affordable housing is defined \nas the ability for households to meet housing costs within 30% of their gross monthly income. \n2  Government of Bhutan, National Statistics Bureau (NSB). 2019.

Manila (SC 107332). \n \n ", "2 \nNearly 63.5% of urban households rent, 17.5% live in rent-free dwellings, and only 19.0% of \nhouseholds own their homes.5 The affordable housing shortage is particularly acute for low-\nincome households, who spend on average more than 40% of their income on housing\u2014greater \nthan the recommended 30%.6 Housing options are becoming increasingly unaffordable for low-\nincome households and vulnerable groups, including women, leaving them in (i) overcrowded \nconditions in shared accommodation, and (ii) residing in informal settlements. \n \n5.  Sector  challenges\u2014planning  constraints,  limited  housing  supply,  and  lack  of \naccess to finance. Unclear and onerous land use planning and zoning constrain the timely \nconversion of agricultural land for housing in Bhutan. The supply of sufficient and appropriately \nzoned land for residential development limits the supply of affordable housing (footnote 6). The \nprivate sector faces challenges in increasing housing stock because of high development costs \nand  the  difficulty  of  acquiring  land  located  near  services  and  employment  centers.  Key \ncommercial housing finance constraints that limit housing development include high land prices \nand maximum lending terms capped at 20 years (footnote 6). Despite these limitations, mortgage \nlending for housing has increased significantly from 17% of total loans in 2018 to 27% in 2020.7 \nThis reflects continuing high demand for housing credit, and is perceived as a medium-term risk \nby domestic banks because of their high exposure in a vulnerable housing sector and the \npossibility of leading to a real estate bubble. For home loans, microfinance is nascent in Bhutan \nand no microfinance institutions offer housing finance to households. Low-income earners are \nunable  to  access  housing  credit  without  verifiable  income  statements  linked  to  formal \nemployment. While making housing finance more accessible to households is necessary to \naddress demand-side challenges, the government needs to intervene to increase housing supply.  \n \n6.  Climate and disaster vulnerability. Bhutan is highly vulnerable to climate change and \nnatural hazards.8 Flooding is considered the most significant climate-related hazard affecting the \nbuilt environment. The country is also exposed to other hazards such as earthquakes, glacial lake \noutburst floods, forest fires, and landslides. Making housing and infrastructure more resilient to \nthe impacts of climate and disaster events is essential to protect the urban population, especially \nthe vulnerable communities. \n \n7.  Government  policy.  Bhutan\u2019s  Twelfth  Five  Year  Plan,  2018\u20132023  prioritizes  the \ngovernment\u2019s strategic thrust for economic stability, economic diversification, poverty reduction, \nand affordable housing provision (footnote 1). The government approved the National Housing \nPolicy (NHP) in 2020. The NHP vision is \u201chousing for all\u201d and the policy objectives are (i) providing \nsafe,  affordable,  and  adequate  rental  housing  for  all;  (ii)  promoting  home  ownership;  (iii) \nencouraging public-private partnerships (PPP) to provide affordable housing; (iv) establishing a \nrobust governance system; and (v) promoting green and energy-efficient housing.9 The NHP \nestablishes an enabling environment for government to unlock housing challenges faced by the \nprivate sector, by committing to reforms to streamline the land use zoning to increase supply, and \nstrengthening housing financing systems by the banking and non-banking sector, coupled with \nfiscal incentives to make housing finance more attractive and providing access to land. The \ngovernment\u2019s public housing program intends to supply 2,500 affordable housing units in a \nphased manner, of which 1,000 are proposed to be built under this project.

The Ministry of Works and Human Settlements (MOWHS) represents the government in \nhuman settlement matters and is responsible for housing policies and preparing urban planning \nstrategies. The NHDCL, a state-owned enterprise, is focused on providing and maintaining public \nhousing. NHDCL units are leased at below market rates, and more than half of them are leased \nto lower-income households. Of its 2,496 units, civil servants account for 84% of tenancies, while \nnon-civil servants account for 15%. Only 1% of NHDCL units are owner-occupied. A preliminary \nassessment of the NHDCL indicates that it operated successfully from 2015 to 2019, averaging \nannual growth of 9.9% in rental revenue, 15.9% in profit after tax, and 8.5% in its asset base. The \ngovernment has tasked NHDCL to increase supply of affordable housing in coordination with the \nNational Land Commission, which is responsible for management and allocation of land, and the \nNational Pension and Provident Fund (NPPF), which has investment portfolio in housing lending. \n \n9.  ADB intervention in the sector. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has adopted a \nholistic, long-term approach to the \u201chousing crunch\u201d in Bhutan.10 Upstream analyses paved the \nway for a policy-based loan (PBL) to develop financial markets using a programmatic approach.11 \nSubprogram 1 of the PBL, approved in 2019 for the Financial Market Development Program, \nfocused on reforms to enhance the efficiency, stability, and inclusiveness of the finance sector \nand supported updating the NHP. In October 2020, ADB approved subprogram 2 of the PBL to \nsupport the development of a  housing finance strategy to address housing supply issues, \nincluding fiscal measures (including incentives to suppliers) and gender-based actions to improve \nwomen\u2019s access to finance (footnote 11). Subprogram 3 of the PBL, approved in October 2021, \nwill support a housing survey across urban areas, implementation of housing financing schemes, \nand developing plans for affordable housing. Complemented by reforms tied to the PBL, this \nproject  will  support  government  efforts  to  increase  housing  supply  and  improve  sector \nperformance by better targeting of the NHDCL\u2019s affordable housing to the lowest income earners \nwhile incorporating climate- and disaster-resilient building designs and innovative construction \nmethods; and strengthening MOWHS\u2019s housing management information system to measure and \nmonitor demand and supply-side bottlenecks in the sector. The government has indicated its \nintention to approach ADB for additional financing to expand affordable housing to cover an \nadditional  5%  of  the shortage  (para. 4).  Additional financing  will  be based  on satisfactory \nperformance and lessons from the project implementation. ADB will coordinate with development \npartners\u2014the World Bank and the Japan International Cooperation Agency\u2014that are providing \nassistance for urban development, and climate change and disaster risk reduction. \n \n10.  The following lessons are incorporated in the project design: (i) TA support is needed to \nachieve sector reforms; (ii) strengthening of the implementing agency\u2019s capacity will ensure \nfinancial  sustainability,  adequate  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  improved  asset \nmanagement; and (iii) a viable business model will be developed.12 \n \n10 ADB. 2017.

Sector lending modality. The project meets sector lending requirements as (i) the \ngovernment has an NHP and implementation program, which provide a framework for sector \ninvestments; (ii) the NHDCL has the capacity to implement the sector development plans; and (iii)  \nthe existing policies are appropriate, and assistance provided under the project will support their \nimplementation. The government has identified affordable rental housing subprojects, which are \nat different stages of readiness, so the sector approach adds flexibility and is suitable. Additional \nsubprojects will be guided by detailed eligibility criteria agreed with the government.13  \n \n12.  Alignment with ADB strategic priorities. The project is consistent with (i) pillar 3 of \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Bhutan, 2019\u20132023 on more inclusive and equitable \nsocioeconomic development; and (ii) ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, as it supports five of the seven \noperational priorities.14 The project aligns with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1 (no \npoverty), SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 11 (sustainable cities), and SDG 13 (climate action).15 It \nis also aligned with ADB\u2019s housing strategy.16  \n \n13.  Coronavirus disease. Bhutan achieved a remarkable reduction in poverty incidence from \n31.7% in 2003 to 8.2% in 2017, but the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is deepening \npreexisting vulnerability.17 ADB estimates that COVID-19 has put about 23,000 jobs at risk. The \nproject provides a direct boost to construction activity and support in the form of job generation, \nwhile increasing the supply of housing for vulnerable, displaced people living in border towns \nheavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n14.  The project is aligned with the following impact: livability, safety, and sustainability of \nhuman settlements ensured (footnote 1). The project will have the following outcome: access to \ngreen and resilient affordable housing for low-income households improved.18 \n \n15.  Output 1: Climate- and disaster-resilient, energy-efficient, and affordable housing \nunits and public facilities for low-income households constructed.19 Output 1 will support \nthe NHDCL in building about 1,000 rental units, three integrated community service centers, and \ntwo recycled waste stations connected to services, in support of SDG 1. The government selected \nhigh-priority investments as subprojects. 20 The increase in the supply of affordable rental housing \nis expected to immediately relieve the housing shortage and benefit lower-income civil servants \n(about 10%) and non-civil servants (about 90%), including marginalized municipal waste workers. \n \nDepartment. 2013.

The  building  designs  incorporate  gender-inclusive  features;  enhanced  safety \nagainst earthquake and fire hazards; and resource efficiency, making greater use of locally \navailable  materials.21 The  building  structures  will  employ  reinforced-concrete  frames  and \ninnovative pre-engineered structures. The project design has identified and incorporated climate \nand disaster resilience features, considering multiple hazards. The project will support green \nbuilding certification through the International Finance Corporation\u2019s Excellence in Design for \nGreater Efficiencies (EDGE) certification program.22 The housing designs reflect local cultural \nheritage values and traditional architecture.23 Additional subprojects will be selected during \nproject implementation in line with the NHP using the eligibility criteria set out in the project \nadministration manual (PAM) (footnote 13). \n \n16.  Output 2: Institutional capacities, policy, and regulatory framework of the housing \nsector strengthened. This output will (i) strengthen the NHDCL\u2019s housing design, construction, \nand  management  capacity\u2014informed  by  climate  and  disaster  risks  and  affordability \nconsiderations; (ii) review the building code and regulations; (iii) develop climate- and disaster-\nresilient building designs and related solutions to improve safety, resource efficiency, and gender \nand disability inclusiveness; (iv) conduct awareness training and a capacity building program for \nkey project stakeholders on climate- and disaster-resilient design and the building code; (v) \nenhance  the  NHDCL\u2019s  business  model,  strengthening  its  O&M  capacity,  and  developing \npartnerships with the private sector; (vi) strengthen the housing management information system \nof the MOWHS by expanding it to include tenancy data and better understand and prepare \nevidence-informed policy updates to address demand and supply-side bottlenecks in the sector; \n(vii) develop a gender and socially inclusive national homeownership strategy, including a rent-\nto-own mechanism; and (viii) provide project implementation support, including supervision, and \nset up a safeguard unit in the NHDCL. \n  \nC.  Value Added by ADB  \n \n17.  ADB assistance will add value by enhancing the NHDCL\u2019s institutional capacity to (i) \nimplement innovative affordable housing designs that incorporate (a) gender-inclusive features; \n(b) anti-seismic building structures; (c) pre-engineered building construction methodology, which \nis versatile and reduces construction time; and (d) resource efficiency, making the housing design \ngreener and more resilient (necessary for green building certification);  (ii) support low-income \nhouseholds in accessing affordable rental housing through better targeted NHDCL units and more \npublicly available information on tenancy data; and (iii) establish a detailed registry for the \nNHDCL\u2019s  housing  asset  management  for  improved  efficiency  in  maintenance  programs. \nAffordability is addressed by providing a choice of units and applying pro-poor beneficiary \nselection criteria. ADB\u2019s value addition also includes a review of the national building code and \nimproved  land  management;  incorporates  climate  change,  disaster  risk  reduction,  gender \ninclusiveness,  and  energy  efficiency  considerations;  and  encourages  the  use  of  greener \nconstruction techniques to achieve green building certification.

The government has requested a concessional loan of $24 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, and a grant not exceeding $6 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \n(ADF) to help finance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of \n8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) has indicated that (i) ADB\u2019s concessional loan of $24 million will be relent to the \nNHDCL through a subsidiary loan agreement with the same terms and conditions as the ADB \nloan, but with the NHDCL bearing the foreign exchange risk; (ii) the ADF grant of $6 million will \nbe passed on as a grant to the NHDCL; and (iii) $7 million in counterpart funding will come from \na loan to the NHDCL from the NPPF, backed by a government guarantee. The NPPF loan will \nhave a 22-year loan period, including a grace period of 2 years, and an interest rate of 7.15% per \nyear. \n \n20.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. The loan and grant will finance expenditures in \nrelation to (i) part of the civil works and equipment, and (ii) consulting services. Counterpart funds, \nprovided  through  NHDCL,  will  finance  expenditures  on  civil  works,  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, consulting services, incremental administration expenses, contingencies, financing \ncharges, and taxes. A project grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) is being \nprocessed as cofinancing to improve disaster and climate resilience for low-income households \nin Bhutan, subject to the approval of the Government of Japan. A JFPR grant proposal would \n \n ", "7 \nfinance improved anti-seismic building standards in Bhutan, pilot-test housing with sanitation and \nenergy-efficient technology, and provide capacity building for enhancing the required technical \nskills and develop the self-help capacities of the poor based on needs assessment.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n23. The project will include an attached TA estimated to cost $1.1 million, of which $1.0 million\nwill be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u20137). The\ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space for\nconsultants, access to information for consultants, and other in-kind contributions.  The TA\nobjectives are to (i) strengthen the NHP and review land availability, land management, and land\nuse planning; (ii) mainstream resilience considerations in the housing development process, and\npromote  the  use  of  innovative  construction  technology  and  practices;  (iii)  establish  an\ninteroperable housing management information system; and (iv) provide technical support to the\nNHDCL on the projects\u2019 safeguard compliance.24 Specifically, the TA will provide technical\nadvisory support services to the NHDCL (i) to review and update its allotment rules to ensure\nconsistency with the NHP, and (ii) to monitor costs and target the uptake of new rental housing\nby  low-income  groups.  It  will  also  assist  the  NHDCL  in  monitoring  and  reporting  on  the\nachievement of the project design and monitoring framework indicators, in addition to ensuring\nthat the project safeguards are effectively managed. The TA will also support the MOWHS in\nreducing the regulatory, land, and financing barriers for mobilizing private sector resources for\nincreasing housing stock that are beyond the remit of the NHDCL.25\nIV. DUE DILIGENCE\nA. Technical\n24. The sector loan modality requires the appraisal of a typology of subprojects that serve as\na sample for future subprojects.26 The specifications applied to affordable housing will match\ngreen building principles such as the reduced use of energy, water, and embodied energy;\ndisaster-resilient design; resource conservation; and the use of energy-efficient practices.\nB. Economic and Financial Viability\n25. The economic rationale for the intervention is sound\u2014focused on inclusiveness, resilience,\nand affordability. The economic analysis evaluated the project\u2019s viability in terms of subprojects\nfor which detailed engineering designs have been completed. The estimated economic internal\n24 The project is benefiting from technical assistance provided through: ADB. 2020.

", "9 \nrates of return is 9.2%, which is higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital of 6%, \nindicating  significant  economic  return.27 The  project\u2019s  economic  viability  is  even  higher  if \nunquantifiable benefits such as environmental improvements are included in the analysis. Asset \nconstruction under this project and capacity building in the NHDCL will benefit about 1,000 \nhouseholds. The estimated poverty impact ratio is 24.4%, and since 8.2% of households in \nBhutan live below the poverty line, the project is expected to benefit the poor.28 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n26.  The project team conducted financial analysis following ADB guidelines, assessing both \nthe project and the NHDCL as the operating entity. Rental revenue is the major source of revenue \nfor the NHDCL. In fiscal year 2019, rent provided 75% of NHDCL revenue. For the project, the \nNHDCL is proposing to charge rental rates similar to those in an affordable housing project in \nPhuentsholing. The NHDCL spends about 20% of its rental revenue on O&M. Rental revenues, \nprojected to grow by 10% every 2 years, can cover debt service as well as O&M costs in most \nyears. In the case of a shortfall in debt servicing caused by either unexpectedly high O&M costs, \nlower rental recovery, or depreciation of the ngultrum against the United States dollar, the MOF \nhas assured ADB that the NHDCL will be able to service the debt. The financial sustainability risk \nis moderate. ADB will provide sector advice, capacity building to enhance the NHDCL\u2019s financial \nperformance. \n \n27.  Affordability  is  crucial  for  ensuring  the  sustainability  of  the  project.  The  project \nbeneficiaries currently pay rents equal to 20.7%\u201341.0% of their household income for homes \naveraging 69 square meters.29 Under the project, the proposed rent for a unit averaging 69 square \nmeters with better services is significantly less, at 16.3%\u201329.1% of household income. The market \nrent for comparable houses is between 35%\u201344% of household income.30 \n \nD.  Governance \n \n28.  Financial  management.  The  financial  management  assessment  followed  ADB \nguidelines.31 The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial because (i) \nthe NHDCL lacks experience in implementing externally financed projects, (ii) two accounts staff \npositions are vacant, and (iii) the statutory auditor has identified internal control weaknesses. \nThese risks will be mitigated by (i) filling the vacant accounting staff positions and engaging a \nfinancial management expert to support the project; (ii) providing training on ADB financial \nmanagement  requirements,  and  disbursement  procedures  and  systems;  (iii)  including \ncomprehensive financial information in the quarterly progress reports; and (iv) addressing pending \naudit observations. Moreover, an independent auditor acceptable to ADB will audit the project \nfinancial  statements  annually  using  auditing  standards  acceptable  to  ADB.  A  financial \nmanagement action plan is described in detail in the PAM (footnote 13). \n \n29.  Procurement. The procurement of works and the recruitment of consultants will follow the \nADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for \n \n27 A 6% threshold for the economic opportunity cost of capital is applicable for social sector projects under ADB. 2017. \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.

Financial Management Technical Guidance Note: Financial Management Assessment. Manila.  \n \n ", "10 \nADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). An assessment of the project procurement \ncapacity risk concluded that the overall procurement risk is moderate. Mitigation measures include \nrecruiting  the  project  implementation  consultant  through  advance  contracting  and  building \ncapacity in the NHDCL on the ADB Procurement Policy and Procurement Regulations for ADB \nBorrowers. The project will enhance value for money through the strategic packaging of multistory \nbuildings  into  (i)  the  construction  of  reinforced-concrete  buildings  and  pre-site  preparation, \nprocured through the local market; and (ii) pre-engineered buildings, procured by bundling \npackages suitable for the international market. \n \n30.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government and the NHDCL. Integrity due diligence was conducted. \nNo significant integrity risks were identified. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 13). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n31.  The project team conducted meaningful consultations with targeted communities. The \nnational poverty line in 2017 was Nu2,195.95 per capita per month. By this measure, the \npercentage of people living in poverty fell from 12.0% in 2012 to 8.2% in 2017. In 2021, the poor \n(based on income criteria) constitute 4.4% of the target population. The average poor household \nhas 4.9 members compared with 3.0 members in non-poor families. About 75.0% of the houses \nof poor families are temporary shelters, a fifth of which do not have piped water supply (footnote \n5). Consultations with the targeted beneficiaries will continue during implementation. \n \n32.  The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. Women comprise 39% of the \ncivil servants in Bhutan.32 Households headed by women comprise 27% of the target population \n(footnote 31). The lack of affordable housing affects women as they are generally responsible for \nhousehold management. A gender equality and social inclusion action plan will address these \nmatters, including (i) at least 30% of housing tenure allotted to households headed by women; (ii) \nthree integrated service centers established to deliver services to women and children, including \na shelter for victims of gender violence, and a daycare and counseling facility benefiting at least \n700 female household members; (iii) two women\u2019s self-help groups established for recycled waste \nlivelihoods; (iv) capacity building on gender mainstreaming; and (v) gender-sensitive policies. The \nNHDCL will engage a civil society organization to implement gender equality solutions. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n33.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.33 \n \n34.  Environment (category B). An environmental assessment and review framework was \nprepared and disclosed following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and applicable government \nregulations; and will guide assessments of additional subprojects on site selection, screening and \ncategorization, information disclosure and consultation, impact assessment and environmental \nmanagement planning, institutional arrangements, grievance redress, monitoring, and reporting. \nThe project will not consider any category A subprojects with significant adverse, irreversible, or \nunprecedented impacts.

Potential impacts are mostly short-\nterm, localized, and related to construction. The project management unit (PMU) and project \nimplementation units will have environmental safeguard officers and site engineers, assisted by \na project implementation assistance consultant, to manage safeguard requirements. The PMU \nwill submit environmental monitoring reports semiannually during project implementation.  \n \n35.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The NHDCL prepared a resettlement framework, \ndraft resettlement plans for the subprojects in Thimphu and Phuentsholing, and a draft due \ndiligence report for Trashiyangtse following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The project will \nnot consider any subproject with significant involuntary resettlement impacts. The government \nland required for the sample subprojects is 4.5 hectares. The sample subprojects will affect 18 \nhouseholds with 65 members, through physical displacement and/or loss of livelihoods; and four \nhouseholds with 19 members, through loss of minor structures and/or trees. One vulnerable \nhousehold with two members is among the affected persons. Proposed mitigation measures and \nsafeguard documents for subprojects are adequate to address the assessed impacts. Safeguard \ndocuments will be updated following the final design. The resettlement framework will guide the \npreparation of resettlement planning documents for additional subprojects. ADB has disclosed \nthe  resettlement  framework  and  resettlement  plans.  The  government  will  disclose  relevant \ninformation from the documents in the local language to the affected people. The NHDCL will \nensure that the resettlement plans are included in the bidding documents. The PMU will prepare \nsemiannual social safeguard monitoring reports for ADB\u2019s review and disclosure. The NHDCL will \nestablish a grievance redress mechanism and disclose it to project beneficiaries and affected \ncommunities before works are awarded. Since this is the NHDCL\u2019s first ADB-funded project, a \ncapacity building program on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement social safeguards execution, \nand monitoring and evaluation is planned. A social safeguard officer in the PMU will manage the \nimplementation of social safeguards, assisted by a project implementation assistance consultant. \nThe project engineer, site engineers, and contractors will  implement the social safeguards \nrequirements in the resettlement plans, and regularly provide project implementation reporting.  \n \n36.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No project impacts are expected on indigenous \npeoples or indigenous communities, as described in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, and no \nplans are required. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n37.
