INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  proposed  policy  and  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  strategic \nplanning  and  policy  development,  better  management  guidelines,  and  targeted  associated \ncapacity development in the water resources sector in Indonesia.1 To support development of \nthe water sector (both water resources and water supply and sanitation) in Indonesia, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) established in 2010 a water team within the Indonesia Resident \nMission in Jakarta to provide strategic guidance and policy support to the Government of \nIndonesia, and to help coordinate and develop ADB\u2019s water program. The TA is in response to \nongoing dialogue between the resident mission and the government, and the government\u2019s \nexpressed need for assistance to address key policy issues in the water resources sector and to \nstrengthen water resources management in Indonesia. \n \n2.  A fact-finding mission was undertaken from 20 July to 4 August 2010 (intermittent) that (i) \nshared the concept paper with the government; (ii) defined the policy areas and scope of work \nfor the TA based on earlier dialogue with the government; (iii) confirmed the TA\u2019s impact and \noutcome, outline terms of reference, costs and financing, and implementation arrangements; (iv) \nverified that the TA was in the \u201cBlue Book\u201d programs list for Bappenas, the State Ministry of \nDevelopment and Planning; and (v) met with the Embassy of Japan to discuss the TA. Concept \nclearance for the TA was approved on 16 August 2010. The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Although progress has been made with regard to institutional reform in Indonesia\u2019s water \nresources sector, including passage of the national Water Law in 2004, the sector is facing \ncritical  challenges  as  the  government  seeks  to  manage  water  resources  and  develop \ninfrastructure in a sustainable manner. In framing the Water Law, the government adopted the \nprinciples  of  integrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM)  to  guide  it,  but  work  is  still \nneeded to develop the specific policies, rules, and regulations to implement the law. Indonesia \nhas undergone an extensive decentralization process over the last decade, and it still needs to \nclarify the roles of central, provincial, and district governments in the water resources sector to \nensure more effective management and development. The TA will focus primarily on improving \nthe  institutional  arrangements  for  (i)  integrated  water  resources  management\u2014river  basin \nmanagement, in particular; and (ii) irrigation management and development. \n \n4.  River basin organizations and water resources management. In line with the IWRM \nprinciples, the government has restructured the institutional arrangements for water resources \nmanagement  through  the  creation  of  river  basin  organizations  (RBOs)  under  the  central \ngovernment.  For  strategic  basins  and  basins  that  cross  provincial  boundaries,  the  central \ngovernment has assumed overall water management responsibility. At the same time, provincial \nauthorities still perform most operation and maintenance (O&M) and management functions, \nsometimes  according  to  short-term  role-sharing  agreements.  Greater  clarity  is  needed  in \ndefining the water management roles and responsibilities of the RBOs, and the long-term \ndevelopment activities to be undertaken by the central, provincial, and district water agencies. \nADB\u2019s  experience  with  the  Integrated  Citarum  Water  Resources  Management  Investment \nProgram,2 periodic financing request 1, and the TA for Capacity Building in Water Resources in \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 October 2010. \n2  ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the Integrated Citarum Water Resources Management Investment Program. Manila. \n(Loans 2500/2501-INO). \n ", "2   \na Decentralized Environment3 have also helped recognize the need for further reform and \ngreater clarity of institutional responsibilities among various agencies. The government has \nformed strategic basins to be managed centrally under the Water Law and would like overall \npolicy guidance regarding this approach, which is based in part on the Citarum experience. \nFinancing the development, operation and maintenance (O&M), and management of water \nresources  and  associated  infrastructure  requires  greater  cooperation  between  government \nagencies and clearly defined responsibilities, in particular regarding the flow and management \nof funds. In some cases where the central government has assumed control of the management \nof a river basin, the provincial and district governments have stopped providing resources \nneeded to manage and develop water resources. There is a need for stronger cooperation and \ncoordination mechanisms between the various levels of government in allocating resources for \nO&M and to manage and develop projects. \n \n5.  Irrigation management and development. Irrigation accounts for nearly 80% of the \nuse of all developed water resources in Indonesia and is critical for (i) the government\u2019s strategy \nfor food security, which relies on self-sufficiency for rice production; (ii) development of the rural \neconomy; and (iii) poverty reduction. ADB\u2019s Participatory Irrigation Sector Project4 (PISP) is \nongoing and, along with the World Bank\u2019s Water Resources and Irrigation Sector Management \nProgram  (WRISMP),  provides  rehabilitation,  capacity  development,  and  institutional \nstrengthening for irrigation. Both PISP and WRISMP support the formation of water users\u2019 \nassociations (WUAs) to encourage farmers to take a more active role in operating, maintaining, \nand  managing  irrigation  service  delivery.  While  these  WUAs  participate  in  the  externally \nfinanced donor programs, their long-term role in the irrigation sector throughout Indonesia \nneeds to be developed. \n \n6.  Similar  to  the  problems  with  RBOs  and  water  resources  management,  irrigation \nmanagement suffers from an overlap of functions and a lack of clarity in the responsibilities of \ncentral, provincial, and district governments, as well as uncertainty over the roles of WUAs. \nAccording to current regulations, the central government is responsible for schemes of more \nthan 3,000 hectares (ha), the provincial governments for schemes from 1,000 ha to 3,000 ha, \nand district governments for schemes of less than 1,000 ha. However, the capacity of the \nvarious agencies at different levels of government varies tremendously and in some cases, \nmanagement arrangements for irrigation are based on short-term role-sharing agreements and \nmay  be  unclear.  At  present,  the  flow  of  funds  between  the  central,  provincial  and  district \ngovernments for O&M of the irrigation schemes is not sufficiently coordinated to ensure the \nhighest possible or sustainable productivity. Under the PISP and WRISMP, memorandums of \nunderstanding  (MOUs)  are  being  pursued  between  WUAs,  and  district  and  provincial \ngovernments  to  improve  O&M  and  fund  flows.  However,  in  the  long  term,  institutional \nrestructuring may be the more robust solution. All these issues have been flagged as areas that \nneed reform through ADB\u2019s experience with PISP. \n \n7.  In  addition  to  O&M  and  management  of  the  existing  irrigation  schemes,  significant \ninvestment  is  needed  to  advance  the  irrigation  sector,  including  the  development  of  new \nirrigation  schemes.  The  rapidly  growing  population,  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  food \nsecurity through self-sufficiency in rice production, and the significant conversion of agricultural \nland\u2014especially  in  Java,  which  has  the  greatest  productivity  per  hectare\u2014necessitate  the \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2007.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the Participatory Irrigation Sector Project. Manila. (Loans 2064/2065-INO). \n ", "  3\nexpansion of irrigated agriculture in new areas. The uncertainty of climate change and its \nimpacts on food production, and the need for long-term resilience of irrigated agriculture also \nrequire  planning  and  investment.  The  government  has  committed  to  the  development  of \n500,000 ha of new irrigation schemes throughout Indonesia. However, it does not have a fully \ndeveloped plan for prioritizing, selecting, and financing the schemes. Assistance is needed to \nhelp shape a strategic vision for the future of irrigation and a plan to achieve it. \n \n8.  ADB and the government program. The country strategy and program, 2006\u20132009 \nand the new country partnership strategy (to be approved in 2011) call for more infrastructure \ninvestment and stronger natural resources management, and the water resources sector plays \na primary role in ADB\u2019s portfolio.5 ADB\u2019s 2010 country operations business plan for Indonesia \nincludes over $1 billion of ongoing and planned investment in the water resources sector.6 \nDevelopment  of  water  resources infrastructure  is  a  core  activity  in  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020.7 \nDevelopment of water resources infrastructure, particularly irrigation, is also a key priority of the \ngovernment\u2019s  National  Medium-Term  Plan,  2010\u20132014.  The  TA  is  consistent  with  ongoing \nprograms of the government and the Directorate General of Water Resources (DGWR) to build \ncapacity and develop the water resources sector, especially river basin management. The \nscope of the proposed TA is based on the experience and lessons learned from implementing \nADB\u2019s program for water resources in Indonesia under the Integrated Citarum Water Resources \nManagement  Investment  Program,  PISP,  and  Capacity  Building  in  Water  Resources  in  a \nDecentralized Environment. The TA is coordinated with and complements ongoing projects by \nADB\u2019s  development  partners,  including  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands,  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank. The TA will contribute strongly to ADB\u2019s \nforward program in the sector. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be improved management and development of the water \nresources sector. The outcome of the TA will be a stronger institutional framework for the water \nresources sector. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will have three outputs: (i) RBOs and water resources management, (ii) irrigation \nmanagement and development, and (iii) dissemination and capacity development. The first two \noutputs comprise the analytical and technical work that will be carried out under the TA. The \nanalytical methodology will involve two approaches. First, there will be extensive consultations \nwith key stakeholders and a review of laws, policies, and regulations to assess how the roles \nand responsibilities are defined within and shared between the central, provincial, and district \nagencies, and how best to promote a comprehensive water management approach in place of a \nrelatively  exclusive  focus  on  construction  and  rehabilitation.  The  TA  will  assess  gaps  and \nconstraints in existing policies, rules, and regulations that impede effective management and \ndevelopment of water resources. The analysis will include an evaluation of current budgeting, \nplanning, and investment processes for water resources and irrigation infrastructure at the \ndistrict, provincial, river basin and central levels. The second approach will be applied analysis \n                                                 \n5  ADB 2006. Country Strategy and Program: Indonesia, 2006\u20132009. Manila. \n6  ADB. 2009.

Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n ", "4   \nusing selective case studies. In consultation with the government, at least two basins for the \nRBO output and at least two basins and/or provinces for the irrigation output will be selected for \npractical  analysis.  The  TA  will  look  at  the  prevailing  realities  for  RBOs  and  irrigation \nmanagement  to  assess  current  practices  and  the  capacity  for  O&M,  management,  and \ndevelopment of water resources and irrigation. Based on the analytical work, the TA will make \nrecommendations for stronger coordination and management. The ultimate goal of the TA is to \npilot-test  these  recommended  institutional  improvements  with  a  view  towards  eventual \nmainstreaming. \n \n11.  Output 1 of the TA\u2014RBOs and water resources management\u2014will recommend ways to \nimprove the institutional framework, clarify the roles and responsibilities (policies, rules, and \nregulations) and the flow of funds for more effective management and development of the water \nresources sector, along with developing tools (e.g., MOUs and role-sharing agreements) for \nbetter  cooperation  in  allocating  resources.  This  output  will  result  in  revised  institutional \narrangements and policy improvements that will be implemented by the government in selected \nriver basins on a pilot basis, focused on the specific needs of the pilot basins. Output 2\u2014\nirrigation management and development\u2014will recommend measures to improve the institutional \nframework, clarify the roles and responsibilities (policies, rules, and regulations) and the flow of \nfunds, along with developing tools (such as MOUs and role-sharing agreements) for better \ncooperation and more effective management and development of irrigation in Indonesia. This \noutput will result in revised institutional arrangements and policy improvements that will be \nimplemented  on  a  pilot  basis.  The  outputs  will  include  policy  and  strategy  documents, \nrecommended  rules  and  regulations,  and  stronger  coordination  mechanisms  to  strengthen \nwater resources management and irrigation. \n \n12.  In addition, output 2 will undertake detailed analysis of the irrigation subsector in light of \nfuture irrigation needs for Indonesia, taking into account issues such as climate change and \nfood  security.  The  analysis  will  identify  the  factors  and  constraints  affecting  irrigation \ndevelopment in the short, medium, and long term. Based on this analysis, the TA will develop \ncriteria, methodologies, and institutional processes for investment planning in the irrigation \nsubsector within a decentralized context. The TA will also evaluate the financial needs for \nexpanding the irrigation subsector in line with the proposed strategy developed through the TA. \n \n13.  Output 3\u2014dissemination and capacity development\u2014will be cross-cutting for the first \ntwo outputs. TA outputs, policy recommendations, and lessons learned will be disseminated \nthrough  (i)  workshops,  focus  groups,  and  conferences;  (ii)  consultations  with  development \npartners and civil society; (iii) ADB's water community of practice; and (iv) publication of at least \none knowledge product. Since adoption of the policy recommendations is a key objective of the \nTA,  effective  dissemination  and  awareness  raising  among  stakeholders  is  most  important. \nLimited targeted capacity development activities, and training directly related to TA outputs and \noutcomes will be provided to government staff and other stakeholders. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $550,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB.  \nThe government of Indonesia will contribute the remaining $50,000 equivalent in kind. Details of \nthe cost estimates and financing are in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  Bappenas will be the executing agency and the Directorate General of Water Resources \n(DGWR) within the Ministry of Public Works will be the implementing agency. It was agreed \nbetween Bappenas and DGWR that Bappenas would be the executing agency because it has a \nbroader sector view for water resources than DGWR. Bappenas is also responsible for planning \nand policy development and thus more suited to lead the TA. Policy guidance and final review of \nTA outputs rests with the director for water resources and irrigation at Bappenas in consultation \nwith the director general at DGWR. DGWR will be the primary agency to coordinate TA activities \nand provide support in the field. The TA will also work closely with the Ministry of Agriculture for \nthe irrigation activities, particularly for the draft irrigation strategy that will require policy analysis \nand other inputs by the agricultural sector. Other related agencies such as the Ministry of \nEnvironment will be consulted, and central, provincial and district stakeholders will be engaged \nin all activities, particularly in the case study areas. \n \n16.  The TA will require about 40 person-months of consulting services\u201412 international and \n28 national person-months\u2014over an implementation period of 14 months, plus 3 months for TA \nclosing. It is anticipated that the TA will start in February 2011 and will finish by April 2012. \nConsultants  with  specialization  in  IWRM  and  irrigation  will  be  recruited  as  individuals.  All \nconsultants will be selected in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  The  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  in \nAppendix 3. Any procurement under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB's Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Equipment for the TA will be procured by the \nTA  consultants  and  turned  over  to  the  government  upon  completion  of  the  TA.  All \ndisbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n17.  The  Indonesia  Resident  Mission  will  administer  the  TA,  ensuring  continuous \ncommunication  and  monitoring  of  progress.  Since  the  TA  will  cover  policy  and  strategy \nformulation, effective policy dialogue is essential. The TA is designed to provide a platform for \ndialogue and advisory services by the resident mission\u2019s water team, and the project officer(s) \nwill participate in frequent meetings with the government to discuss progress and application of \nTA outputs. Inception reports will be prepared and discussed with the government to finalize the \nterms of reference and confirm specific policy issues to be addressed during the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof Indonesia to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for \nInstitutional Strengthening for the Water Resources Sector, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nPerformance Targets \nDesign  and Indicators with  Data Sources and \nSummary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \n       \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved management and  Central, provincial, and  Reports and feedback from  The government\u2019s demand for \ndevelopment of the water  district governments  the government  and ownership of policy and \nresources sector  cooperating more    planning assistance in the water \neffectively in managing the  ADB review missions and  resources sector remains \nwater resources sector  evaluation   robust. \nwithin 3 to 5 years   \nRisk \nThe government will reverse \nmajor policy decisions for the \nwater resources sector while the \nTA is ongoing or after its \ncompletion. \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nA stronger institutional  Government  support and  Reports and feedback from  ADB lending program and \nframework for the water  application of the policies,  the government  nonlending program can \nresources sector  strategies, and guidelines    support and help implement and \nproduced by the end of the    mainstream policy and planning \nTA    recommendations from TA. \n     \nPilot adoption of TA  Official changes in policy at  Risk \nrecommendations, policies,  the central, provincial, and  The TA will not be able to \nand guidelines following the  district level  facilitate cooperation or \ncompletion of the TA    agreements among central, \n  provincial, and district \ngovernments with regard to \nroles and responsibilities for the \nvarious aspects of the TA. \n \nOutputs       Assumption \n1.
