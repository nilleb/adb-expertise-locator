INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the implementation of \nmeasures to prepare for and respond to needs arising from the coronavirus disease  (COVID-19) \nby  civil  society  organizations  (CSOs),  including  community-based  organizations  and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs).1 The TA will support CSOs to provide services in three \nareas: (i) community-based mitigation and prevention activities; (ii) social protection for vulnerable \ncommunities, including elderly care; and (iii) economic support for those with livelihoods affected \nby COVID-19. The TA will focus on opportunities for the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to create \nnew partnerships with CSOs in several countries where civil society activity in the COVID-19 \nresponse  complements  the  ADB  portfolio.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Comprehensive \nResponse to the COVID-19 Pandemic2 and supports Strategy 2030\u2019s3 aims of engaging with \nCSOs in the delivery of development assistance.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Community-based response needed. Risk and vulnerability to the impacts of COVID-\n19 are increased for populations living in poverty, as they have lower capacity to take preventative \nmeasures, less access to health services, and fewer resources to cope with a reduction in income \nto meet basic needs. The pandemic is exacerbating preexisting inequalities and vulnerabilities for \ndisadvantaged groups such as children, women, older persons, people with disabilities, and \nmigrants.5 The number of people living in poverty is projected to increase by 177 million globally \nin 2020, further reducing resilience of communities.6 The gendered impact of COVID-19 is already \nevident in different dimensions, including health, education, the increased burden of unpaid care \nwork, and gender-based violence.7 Persons with specific vulnerabilities who rely on others for \nsupport and help with activities of daily living, such as persons needing care or the homeless, \nrequire increased support during the pandemic. Given the scale of the crisis, the rapidly changing \nsituation, and the fluctuating restrictions on movement, a community-based response is required.8 \nCSOs are well placed to respond to these needs promptly, through their networks of community \ngroups and their understanding of the assets and resources in their communities that can \nbe mobilized to  meet  local  needs.  While  CSOs  are  especially  qualified  to  reach  poor  and \nvulnerable  groups  through  participatory  approaches  and  propose  and  deliver  short-term \ncommunity-based solutions, ADB is supporting large-scale health and social protection measures \nfor  longer-term  sustainability.  ADB  recognizes  that  civil  society  contributions  enable  ADB-\nfinanced operations to deliver better development outcomes.9  \n  \n \n1  ADB defines CSOs as nonprofit organizations independent from the government that operate around common \ninterests.  They  vary  in  size,  interests,  and  function,  and  include  NGOs,  youth  groups,  community-based \norganizations, independent academic and research institutes, professional associations, foundations, faith-based \norganizations, people\u2019s organizations, and labor unions. CSOs represent the interests of their members or others. \n2  ADB. 2020. ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2018.

Manila. \n ", "2 \n3.  Social protection for vulnerable individuals and communities. CSOs often provide \nvital services to fill the gaps in formal social protection systems. The services of many existing \ncommunity  social  welfare  programs,  such  as  food  and  meals  schemes,  care  services  to \nvulnerable individuals and households, and information and helpline services, are in higher \ndemand during the COVID-19 pandemic. As demand for services increases, social welfare \norganizations are facing challenges from the crisis with issues such as the need to reorganize \nbusiness processes and services to adapt, staff shortages, and reductions in income. With the \nprolonged nature of the crisis, scaling back services will weaken the safety nets of the poor and \nvulnerable when they are most needed. Furthermore, vulnerable groups, such as cross-border \nmigrant workers and people living in fragile and conflict-affected areas, may not be reachable by \ngovernment-implemented social protection measures and, as a result, may become more reliant \non the continuation of nongovernment services and community support. \n \n4.  Economic  support  for  those  with  livelihoods  affected  by  COVID-19.  Global \nemployment losses are expected to range from 158 million to 242 million jobs, with Asia and the \nPacific  comprising  70%  of  total  expected  employment  losses.10 The  impact  of  the  abrupt \ndisruption  to  livelihoods  has  affected  many  low-  and  middle-income  earners,  particularly \nwomen. Many developing member countries have implemented economic stimulus packages to \nprovide some immediate and short-term income protection to formal and informal workers, and \nsupport to small and medium-sized enterprises to support businesses in difficulty, but these \nmeasures  are  not  a  substitute  for  income  from  work.  The  timing  of  any  recovery  is \nuncertain and, in some sectors such as tourism and hospitality, recovery may be slower than \nother sectors.11 There is an urgent need to create new jobs and livelihood opportunities locally to \nprovide an immediate and medium-term economic buffer. ADB\u2019s experience in social protection \nwill add value to the community-led response. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n5.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic \nreduced in selected communities in Asia and the Pacific (footnote 2). The TA will have the \nfollowing outcome: collaboration with CSOs and community-based organizations in supporting \nCOVID-19-affected communities increased.12 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n6.  Output 1: Community-based crisis prevention, mitigation, and adaptation capacity \nincreased. The TA will strengthen the COVID-19 public health response through community-\nbased prevention and mitigation actions. It will support local CSOs and authorities to assess key \nrisks in the community and identify vulnerable individuals within their affected or at-risk rural or \nurban communities to develop appropriate mitigation and response plans based on local needs \nand contexts. Activities will complement government responses; be gender responsive; and \ninclude such activities as conducting risk communication campaigns, establishing contact tracing \nand reporting systems, training and managing volunteers, setting up handwashing points, raising \n \n10 ADB. 2020.

Output  2:  Informal  social  protection  programs  stressed  by  COVID-19  impacts \nsupported. The TA will scale up ongoing successful social protection programs and social \nservices that CSOs are currently leading to support vulnerable people. For example, some CSOs \nare providing support to domestic violence victims as well as access to education, food, and \nmedical and care services, especially in areas not reached by government services or with \ninsufficient access. These programs and services have an important function in an effective public \nhealth response, and they mitigate the negative physical and mental health impacts of restrictions \nimplemented to control COVID-19 outbreaks. The TA will support CSOs\u2019 resources and capacity \nto provide long-term social safety nets to vulnerable groups and strengthen coordination with \nother services, such as primary health care. \n \n8.  Output 3: Economic support provided for people with livelihoods affected by the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The TA will support CSOs to create opportunities for alternative livelihood \nopportunities for those who are unemployed or whose livelihoods have been affected because of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, particularly women. Target groups will include informal or migrant \nworkers, displaced persons, and/or those working in industries shuttered because of COVID-19 \nsuch as tourism, hospitality, food service, and others as identified by the relevant government \nagency (the department of social welfare or its equivalent). Economic support activities will focus \non alternative means of temporary (or potentially long-term) livelihoods, with priority given to work \nopportunities in the activities covered under output 1 (prevention, mitigation, and adaptation) and \noutput 2 (social protection for vulnerable communities) such as community health workers,  social \nworkers, and contact tracers. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n10.  ADB will administer the TA. The NGO and Civil Society Center under the Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department will undertake the overall administration and \nimplementation  of  the  TA,  in  collaboration  with  divisions  of  relevant  regional  departments, \nincluding the Southeast Asia Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination Division. \n \n11.  ADB will issue an amplified expression of interest that will be advertised in the Consultant \nManagement System as well as through umbrella organizations and social media platforms that \nCSOs use in in the target countries. The TA is designed so that the proposing CSOs can assess \nand respond to the most urgent needs for the contexts in which they operate. CSOs will be \nrequired to address the risks of prolonged impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent \nwaves of community transmission.
