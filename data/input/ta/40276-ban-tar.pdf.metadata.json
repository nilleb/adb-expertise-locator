During the Country Programming Mission from 2 to 19 July 2006, the Government of \nBangladesh  (the  Government)  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide \nassistance  for  promoting  private  sector  participation  to  support  sustainable  power  sector \ndevelopment. ADB conducted the Fact-Finding Mission (the Mission) from 5 to 11 September \n2006 to reach an understanding with the Government on the impact, outcome, outputs, cost \nestimates, financing, implementing arrangements, and the consultants\u2019 terms of reference of the \nproposed technical assistance (TA).1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Over the past decade, Bangladesh has taken great strides in its economic and social \ndevelopment. Yet, nearly half of the population remains poor, with per capita gross domestic \nproduct of $445 in 2005. Only a third of households have access to electricity and this minority \nreceives a poor, unreliable service characterized by frequent power outages and low voltage, \nresulting from insufficient power generation and supply capacity. Inadequate supply of electricity \nhas  been  a  major  constraint  to  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in  Bangladesh. \nPromotion of sustainable economic growth\u2014by providing reliable power supply\u2014is the main \nstrategic pillar for reducing poverty in ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for 2006\u20132010.2  \n \n3.  Recognizing  that  investment  requirements  for  the  power  sector  would  exceed  the \nresources available in the public sector, the Government took a policy decision in 1994 to \npursue private sector led development. A long-term policy paper in 1994 titled Power Sector \nReforms in Bangladesh (PSRB) outlined the reform process to gradually remove constraints in \nthe sector through promotion of private sector participation, among others. In 1996, with the \nsupport of ADB and other development partners (DPs), the Government set out the Private \nSector Power Generation Policy (PSPGP) to introduce independent power producers (IPPs). In \n1998, the Government formulated Policy Guidelines for Small Power Plants in Private Sector \nand licenses have been issued to three small power plants developed by the private sector. In \n2006, the Government issued a 3-year road map for power sector reforms. One of the main \nstrategic pillars is promoting private sector participation through, among others, formulating \npublic-private partnership (PPP), e.g., joint venture finance in generation. \n \n4.  Until  the  late  1990s,  mainly  because  of  the  above  policy  framework  and  favorable \nmarket conditions, Bangladesh had been successful in attracting the private sector\u2014particularly \nin generation where ADB played a catalytic role. Since the PSRB was introduced, IPPs have \nestablished new capacity totaling 1,290 megawatt (MW) over a total of seven plants, producing \nabout  38%  of  current  total  national  generation.  ADB  recently  evaluated  its  power  sector \nassistance  program  in  Bangladesh3.  The  study  recognized  that  the  IPP  project  has  been \noperating  successfully  and  producing  power  at  reasonable  cost  to  Bangladesh  Power \nDevelopment Board (BPDB) with a high level of reliability.  \n \n5.  However, Bangladesh has recently been facing difficulties in mobilizing further private \ncapital, as is the case in other developing countries. A worldwide trend shows that private \ninvestors\u2019 interest in IPPs in developing countries has fallen off, and the number and value of \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 15 September 2006. \n2  ADB. 2006, Country Strategy and Program for 2006\u20132010.

Manila. \n ", "2   \ntransactions sponsored by these investors are well below their peak in 1997. Several factors are \ngenerally considered to contribute to the falloff, including: (i) financial crises (e.g., the Asian \nfinancial crisis in 1997 featured steep devaluations of local currencies that undermined the \nsustainability of investments); (ii) conditions in international capital markets and the drop in \ninvestors\u2019 market capitalization values affected their ability to raise capital for new investments; \nand (iii) concerns have been raised about the stability and enforceability of the legal and \nregulatory framework in power sector reform.  \n \n6.  Among  these,  enforceability  of  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  is  needs  to  be \nstrengthened in Bangladesh. Several attempts to award contracts for new IPP projects in the \nlast few years have not been very successful, partly because of insufficient competition with less \ninternational participants under unfavorable capital market conditions, and partly because of \nperceived irregularities in procurement procedures. Local investors also tend to be discouraged \nfrom participating in IPP bidding in the absence of an appropriate regulatory framework and \nrequirements of high capital investment.  \n \n7.  Another  challenge  is  to  create  opportunities  for  various  kinds  of  private  sector \ninvestment from large-scale international syndicates to community-based small businesses. \nPPP is expected to lower entrance barriers, reduce risks, and leverage capital if it is properly \ndesigned and implemented. In this regard, the power sector in Bangladesh has been making \nefforts to formulate PPP, e.g., a joint venture between BPDB and the private sector. However, \nno successful PPP models have been realized so far. BPDB recognizes that an explicit PPP \npolicy and regulatory framework need to be developed.  \n \n8.  PPP has been continuously evolving with the latest financial structuring methods and \nrisk mitigation measures in the fields of large-scale infrastructure development. There is a need \nto review various models and identify suitable ones for the power sector in Bangladesh. \n \n9.  In addition to generation, the distribution subsector also has great potential for private \nsector participation. The positive market response to recent listing of the shares of the Dhaka \nElectric Supply Company Limited (DESCO) in the local stock market represents the interest of \nthe local private sector to enter the distribution business. At the operational level, DESCO has \nattempted various private sector participation approaches, including outsourcing commercial \nactivities to the private sectors. However, in the absence of an adequate policy for private sector \nparticipation in the distribution subsector, implementation of these initiatives is limited to an \nentity level and is on an ad hoc basis. To enhance the financial viability of the whole distribution \nsubsector  through  application  of  best  practices,  a  comprehensive  policy  framework  for \npromoting private sector participation covering all the power subsectors needs to be developed.   \n \n10.  ADB has supported evolving private sector participation in the Bangladesh energy sector. \nMajor  lessons  learned  from  earlier  ADB  TAs  will  be  incorporated  in  the  implementation \narrangements under this TA. Important lessons include the need for a transparent and clear \ninternational competitive bidding process, and the importance of clear project definitions.    \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA aims to facilitate further private sector entries and investments, or PPP financing, \nfor power sector projects in a flexible, efficient, and transparent manner, thereby contributing to \nenhanced  and  sustainable  electric  power  supply  in  Bangladesh.  The  TA  will  help  the \n ", "  3\nGovernment to update PSPGP and formulate enforceable regulations to be tailored to the local \nmarket environment. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The  proposed  TA  will  review  and  analyze  current  constraints  and  bottlenecks  for \npromoting  private  sector  participation,  including  PPP  initiatives  in  the  power  sector  in \nBangladesh. Based on the analysis, the proposed TA will provide an institutional framework and \nrecommendations for new policy initiatives and reforms for private sector participation in the \npower sector. PPP guidelines, several PPP models in generation and distribution subsectors \npolicy guidelines will be also prepared to assist government officials and relevant agency staff.  \n \n13.  To  develop  a  practical  policy  framework,  guidelines,  and  models  applicable  to \nBangladesh, the TA will take a participatory approach to reflect inputs from all stakeholders, \nincluding the Government and its agencies, labor unions, beneficiaries, investors, operators, \nsuppliers, financiers, consumers, and DPs. The TA recommendations will be disseminated and \nexplained to government officials and agency staff.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $600,000 \non a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \nGovernment will finance the remaining $150,000 equivalent in kind through the provision of \nadministrative setup, including office space, office equipment, and local transportation. Detailed \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Executing Agency (EA) will be the Power Division of the Ministry of Power, Energy \nand Mineral Resources (MPEMR). BPDB will provide technical and administrative support to \nMPEMR and will provide technical advice and suggestions to a consulting team to be recruited \nunder the TA, as well as logistical support and coordination with various stakeholders. The \nPower Division of MPEMR will designate a project director and will set up a steering committee \nto supervise implementation of the TA. It is envisaged that the steering committee will consist of \nrepresentatives from MPEMR and other agencies concerned, including BPDB. The committee \nwill discuss the TA outputs, provide feedback and guidance to the consultants, and suggest how \nto implement the TA recommendations in practice. The Power Division of MPEMR will assume \nthe secretariat function of the committee. \n \n16.  The EA and BPDB will provide (i) office accommodation and facilities, internet access, \nand secretarial support; and (ii) land transportation within Bangladesh for consultants. The EA, \nBPDB, and agencies concerned will also provide the consultants with existing data, preliminary \nanalysis,  and  reports;  and  will  guide  consultants  in  data  collection  in  liaising  with  other \ngovernment  ministries  and  agencies.  MPEMR,  BPDB,  other  relevant  agencies,  and  the \nconsultants  will  jointly  organize  dissemination  workshops  for  counterpart  staff  and  other \nstakeholders. The EA will ensure close coordination with the consultants of various ongoing TAs \nof ADB and other DPs. The consultants will incorporate lessons from past TAs of ADB and other \nDPs in the power sector. The consultants will organize workshops, seminars, and consultation \nmeetings to brief stakeholders and receive their feedback on the policy update, PPP guidelines, \nand the proposed PPP models in collaboration with ADB, MPEMR, BPDB, and distribution \ncompanies. The consultants will be accountable to both ADB and the EA. \n ", "4   \n \n17.  The TA will require about 14 person-months of international and 20 person-months of \nnational  consulting  services.  Appendix  3  provides  the  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultants. The TA will be implemented over 8 months from February 2007 to September 2007. \nADB will engage a consulting firm or consortium of firms in accordance with its Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants. Recruitment of consultants will be under the quality and cost based \nselection procedures, and simplified technical proposals will be requested.  \n \n18.  The  consultants  will  submit  an  inception  report  no  later  than  2  weeks  after  the \ncommencement of their services. An interim report will be submitted within 10 weeks after \ninception and a draft final report will be submitted within 16 weeks after inception.  The inception \nreport will detail initial findings and the consultants\u2019 proposed action plan. The first tripartite \nmeeting between the Government, ADB, and the consultants will review the inception report in \nDhaka within 3 weeks of receiving it. An interim report will describe the TA\u2019s progress, person-\nmonths  utilized,  problems  encountered,  and  proposed  revision  of  the  work  plan;  and  will \nincorporate detailed reports on completion of the current policy analysis. A draft final report will \ndetail the consultants\u2019 findings and recommendations. The second tripartite meeting will review \nthe interim report and the third tripartite meeting will review the draft final report. The consultants \nwill organize: (i) two workshops after the second and third tripartite meeting to brief stakeholders \nand receive their feedback on the policy update, PPP guidelines, and models; and (ii) a seminar \nat the conclusion of the TA to disseminate the findings. The final report will be submitted within \n4 weeks after the tripartite review of the draft final report. The consultants will prepare monthly \nstatus reports for their specific scope of work, highlighting any issues that could become critical \nfor the timely completion of the TA.  \n \nIV.
