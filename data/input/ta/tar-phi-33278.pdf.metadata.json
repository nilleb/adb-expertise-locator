During the 2002 Country Programming Mission, the Government of the Philippines \nconfirmed its request to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help implement the Health \nSector Reform Agenda (HSRA) developed by the Department of Health (DOH). This request \nmeets ADB's health sector priorities to enhance access to essential health services for the poor. \nA Fact-Finding Mission in August 2002 reached understanding with the Government on the \nobjective, scope, budget and implementation arrangements for the technical assistance (TA).1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  While the health of the Filipinos has significantly improved over the last 50 years, many \nchallenges remain. In recent years, improvements in health status have lagged. Large variations \nin health status persist across population groups mainly due to poor coverage of public health \nand primary care services. There is unequal access to health services due to geographic and \nfinancial barriers. Inadequate funding and management systems limit the impact of the public \nhealth programs. Allocation of available funding is inefficient and inequitable. Curative health \nfacilities are either inadequate or inappropriate. With devolution, the lack of coordination among \nlocal government units (LGUs) has sometimes compromised the effectiveness of the health \ncare delivery system at the local level. \n \n3.  About 75 Filipinos die from tuberculosis every day and an estimated 270,000 new cases \nare identified every year. The directly observed treatment strategy (DOTS) promoted by DOH \nreaches almost 100% of the public health care providers, but with 30\u201340% of all tuberculosis \npatients probably consulting private health care providers, the private sector has a significant \nrole  to  play  in  the  program.  Reproductive  health  strategies  encompass  safe  motherhood, \nadolescent health, prevention of sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS,2 and access \nto family planning. All these issues need to be carefully addressed so that the poor who do not \nhave easy access to the private sector and rely mostly on the public health programs to cover \ntheir reproductive health needs receive tangible benefits. \n \n4.  The majority of the poor rely on public (government) health services, which are free or \nlow-cost. But public health services, particularly curative services at the primary health care \n(PHC) level, are considered of poor quality and do not adequately meet the needs of the poor. \nThe number of doctors in PHC facilities is very low, and medical supplies (including drugs) are \noften not available. Frequently the patient purchases the necessary supplies from the market. \nMany patients bypass PHC services to go directly to secondary and tertiary hospitals. As a \nresult, patients that could be treated at PHC facilities at much lower cost overburden higher \nlevel facilities. To improve the health care delivery system, there is a need to improve PHC \ncurative services, and guarantee the availability of essential drugs and medical supplies. \n \n5.  Under the Local Government Code, which came into effect in 1992, LGUs\u2014provinces, \ncities and municipalities\u2014are responsible for financing and managing most of the public health \ncare facilities. Devolution of health services to the LGUs resulted in fragmentation of the public \nhealth care system, with poor coordination among the various levels of health care facilities \nindependently managed by different LGUs. Ten years after devolution, the performance of \nprovincial and district hospitals and of the public health services delivery system in general is \n                                                 \n1   The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities in 22 February 2001 then relisted on 6 December 2002. \n2   HIV/AIDS = infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which causes the acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome (AIDS) ", "2 \nconsidered  unsatisfactory.  Financial  resources  are  often  insufficient  for  operating  and \nmaintaining hospitals. LGUs often complain that the meager Internal Revenue Allocation they \nreceive does not allow them to provide reasonable health care services. But lack of local \ncapacity, weak supervision, and inadequate management guidelines also have had an impact \non the quality of the health care delivery system under devolution. \n \n6.  To address these problems, DOH developed in 1999 the HSRA, a comprehensive \napproach to reform the health sector in five related areas: social health insurance, hospital \nreforms, public health programs, health regulation, and local health systems. HSRA aims to \nimprove the health system by (i) mobilizing new resources and targeting the Government's \nsubsidies  on  the  poor  under  a  social  health  insurance  system,  (ii)  improving  hospital \nmanagement,  (iii)  ensuring  funding  and  improving  essential  public  health  programs,  (iv) \nstrengthening health regulations, and (v) developing the local health systems and reap the full \nbenefits of devolution.3 While DOH can provide leadership and technical support, the successful \nimplementation of HSRA now depends on the participation and support of the LGUs. \n \n7.  The  five  reform  areas  of  HSRA  are  interdependent  and  require  simultaneous \nimplementation.  With  a  functioning  social  health  insurance  system,  the  Government  can \nsubsidize the health insurance premium of the poor, while those who can afford to pay will pay \ntheir own premium. Government subsidies will no longer be targeted to health care facilities, but \nto the poor directly. To ensure that those who can afford to pay for health services are also \nwilling to pay for them, the quality of the services must improve. Health facilities must be \nupgraded, the necessary medical equipment provided, and quality control in health services \nensured. With better managed hospitals and new resources mobilized through health insurance, \nthe national Government and the LGUs will be able to allocate more resources to public health \nprograms.4 Health regulations and their enforcement are important mechanisms to guarantee \nthe quality of the health services. All these reforms need to be implemented in the local health \nsystems, with the support of the LGUs. \n \n8.  Implementing HSRA will require significant investment. DOH has opted for progressive \nimplementation, starting in selected convergence sites5 where existing conditions\u2013in particular, \ninterest  and  support  of  the  LGUs  for  improving  local  health  services\u2013should  facilitate \nimplementation of the interrelated reforms of HSRA.  \n \n9.  A number of interventions directly or indirectly related to the implementation of HSRA \nhave been completed or are ongoing. There  is a felt need to take stock of what has been \nundertaken and review lessons learned to further improve the implementation of HSRA.  \n \n10.  DOH has requested its development partners to continue supporting the implementation \nof HSRA, and to provide assistance at the national level and in selected convergence sites. \nGerman Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and the World Bank have already started \npreparing their programs of assistance.6 At the national level, the World Bank will strengthen the \n                                                 \n3  Philippines, 1999. Health Sector Reform Agenda. 1999-2004. \n4   Public health programs include communicable diseases control program, food safety, promotion of a healthy \nlifestyle in a healthy environment. \n5   A convergence site is a province committed to implementing HSRA, involving all cities and municipalities within \nits jurisdiction. Within the convergence site, inter-local health zones will be established to include neighboring \nmunicipalities and cities where a referral health system can be organized efficiently with primary, secondary, and \ntertiary levels of health care services. \n6   There is good aid coordination among donors and both GTZ and the World Bank have shared their findings with \nADB. ", "    3 \nnational  health  insurance  program  and  assist  DOH  to  develop  clinical  and  therapeutic \nguidelines, and to regulate the quality of drugs. GTZ will continue its technical support for health \ninsurance for the poor and the provision of essential drugs to communities. In parallel, GTZ and \nthe World Bank will assist selected convergence sites.7 \n \n11.  DOH has requested ADB's assistance to contribute to health sector reforms and support \nprograms in selected convergence sites. DOH has selected a preliminary list of 11 convergence \nsites for possible ADB support.8 DOH has also requested ADB's assistance to review and \nassess the public health programs, a major component of HSRA. Two programs are of high \npriority for DOH: the reproductive health program and the program against tuberculosis, which \nare of particular significance for the poor. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The TA aims (i) to strengthen DOH capability to implement HSRA by reviewing its \ncurrent status and assessing unmet needs, and (ii) to prepare a feasibility study for a project \nproposal to support the implementation of HSRA. The TA will be implemented in two phases \nand address both policy issues and investment requirements. The first phase will consist of a \ncomprehensive review of various projects and studies related to HSRA and an assessment of \nthe gaps and requirements to successfully implement HSRA. The second phase will prepare a \ndetailed project proposal to support implementation of HSRA in selected convergence sites and \nstrengthen DOH's public health programs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Several projects have supported and tested various aspects of HSRA. In the first phase, \na team of consultants will undertake a comprehensive review of these projects, paying special \nattention  to  their  impact  on  the  poor.  Among  others,  the  team  will  consolidate  available \ninformation on the progress of reforms in the following areas: integrated health planning system, \nhospital  management  information  system,  and  health  financing  systems;9  social  health \ninsurance and local health networking; partnership mechanisms with LGUs and nongovernment \norganizations (NGO);10 incentive schemes for improving the health performance of LGUs; and \ncommunity-based  social  health  insurance  schemes  for  the  informal  sector.  Some  DOH \ninitiatives such as the hospitals as Centers for Wellness, the Sentrong Sigla11 accreditation for \npublic health facilities, and the development of inter-local health zones will also be reviewed. \n \n14.  The consultants will identify policy issues related to poverty targeting that need to be \nfurther addressed by HSRA and make appropriate recommendations. The team will analyze the \nrole  of  the  regional  centers  (Centers  for  Health  Development),  assess  capacity  and  skill \nrequirements of the LGUs for implementing HSRA, and identify mechanisms to strengthen \npublic  health  programs,  particularly  reproductive  health  (including  family  planning)  and \n                                                 \n7   (i) Province of Southern Leyte supported by GTZ; and (ii) the provinces of Pangasinan, Misamis Occidental, \nCapiz and Agusan del Sur by the World Bank. \n8   The list includes Ilocos Norte, Nueva Vizcaya, Oriental Mindoro, Romblon, Palawan, Siquijor, Ifugao, Surigao del \nSur, Catanduanes, Davao del Norte, and Tawi-Tawi. \n9   Developed under the Integrated Community Health Services Project, cofinanced by ADB (Loan 1396-PHI[SF] \napproved in October 1995 for $20.78 million).  \n10   Developed under Women and Safe Motherhood Project, cofinanced by ADB (Loan 1331-PHI[SF] approved in \nNovember 1994 for $33.10 million). \n11   The Sentrong Sigla (Center of Vitality) accreditation is given by DOH to public primary health care facilities. ", "4 \ntuberculosis  control  and  prevention,  under  HSRA.  The  team  will  assess  the  prospect  for \npursuing successful initiatives, and identify priority investments, giving priority to the health \nneeds of the poor. \n \n15.  At the end of the first phase, the consultants will submit to DOH and ADB a mid-term \nreport to be discussed at a tripartite meeting. The report will describe the specific objectives that \nan ensuing project supported by an ADB loan will want to achieve. The report will also propose \nselection criteria to identify provinces that are most ready as convergence sites, and provide \ndetailed information related to these criteria for the 11 provinces pre-selected by DOH. The \nconsultants will in particular assess the respective LGUs' commitment to HSRA and their \nwillingness and capacity to share the cost of implementing it. Five convergence sites will be \nselected for a feasibility study.  \n \n16.  In the second phase, the consultants will conduct a feasibility study in the 5 selected \nconvergence sites and develop a project proposal for possible ADB financing. The feasibility \nstudy will first identify local health needs and priorities through participatory workshops involving \nall stakeholders: beneficiaries, decision-makers and health services providers. The consultants \nwill also develop a set of technical, economic and financial criteria for identifying HSRA-related \npolicy reforms and investments, which will ensure that the poor will be the main beneficiaries of \nthe ensuing project. A project proposal will then be developed and discussed at stakeholders\u2019 \nworkshops. The consolidated proposal will provide detailed information on the proposed project, \nincluding cost estimates and implementation arrangements. Financing mechanisms, counterpart \nfunds requirements and cost sharing mechanisms between the national Government and the \nconcerned LGUs will need to be determined in a tripartite meeting (Government, ADB, and \nconsultants).12 The recommendations of this meeting will be included in the final report. \n \n17.  The methodology will rely on building partnerships and participation. On DOH's request, \nall  development  partners  are  involved  in  supporting  HSRA  (para.  10).  There  is  good \ncollaboration among the aid agencies and DOH, which will be tapped to improve quality of \nproject design, avoid duplication, and ensure complementarity. After convergence sites have \nbeen  selected  for  a  project  proposal,  the  consulting  team  will  ensure  that  the  project  is \ndeveloped by the concerned LGUs with participation of all stakeholders. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $860,000 equivalent, comprising $151,000 in \nforeign currency and $709,000 equivalent in local currency. It is proposed that ADB provide a \ngrant of $600,000 equivalent to meet the entire foreign currency cost and $449,000 equivalent \nof the local currency costs. The TA  will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide support \nfacilities, counterpart staff, office facilities, administrative support, and other logistical support \nincluding local ground transportation, the cost of which is estimated to total $260,000 equivalent. \nThe Government assured the availability of counterpart services, facilities, and funds by the \nexpected starting date of the TA. Details of the cost estimate and financing plan are in Appendix \n1. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing \nany ensuing project. \n \n                                                 \n12   A project loan is the preferred option but a sector development program may be considered if significant policy \nissues need to be addressed to ensure the success of HSRA in the selected convergence sites.  ", "    5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  DOH will be the Executing Agency for the TA. An international consulting firm will be \nengaged to provide 5 person-months of international consulting services and 36 person-months \nof  domestic  consulting  services  using  the  simplified  technical  proposal  procedure.  The \nconsulting team will include international consultants with expertise in health sector reforms, \nhealth economics and public-private partnership; and domestic experts with expertise in health \nsector reforms, public health, project financial analysis, organizational development, health \ninfrastructure, environmental impact assessment, public-private partnership, social marketing, \nand  poverty  analysis.  The  consulting  firm  will  recruit  facilitators  for  the  social  marketing \ncampaign and for participatory workshops. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 2. ADB \nwill engage the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. Funds will also be \nallocated for office equipment, surveys, and participatory workshops. \n \n20.  During  the  first  phase,  advocacy  workshops  on  HSRA  and  TA  objectives  will  be \norganized for various groups of stakeholders in the 11 pre-selected provinces assisted by \nfacilitators  with  experience  in  social  marketing.  During  the  second  phase  of  the  TA,  the \nconsultants will organize a series of participatory workshops in the selected convergence sites \nassisted by experienced facilitators. After consulting with all stakeholders on their needs and \npriorities, the consultants will develop draft project proposals for each convergence site to be \ndiscussed  with  stakeholders.13  A  national  workshop  at  the  end  of  the  second  phase  will \nconsolidate LGU-related subprojects into one project proposal. The consultants are expected to \nbegin working in the field in April 2003. The TA will be implemented over about 6 months and is \nexpected to be completed by November 2003.  \n \n21.  The Government will establish a steering committee comprising DOH and the oversight \nagencies (National Economic Development Authority, Department of Finance and Department \nof  Budget  and  Management)  to  provide  policy  guidance  and  overall  direction.  The  DOH \nUndersecretary for External Affairs will chair the committee and act as project director for the \nTA. DOH's technical coordinating group, established to monitor implementation of HSRA,14 will \nbe expanded to include representatives of other stakeholders (in particular, the Centers for \nHealth Development and the LGUs), and will be responsible for ensuring the technical integrity \nof the TA output. The director of DOH's Health Policy Development and Planning Bureau will \ncoordinate TA implementation as TA project Manager. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Philippines for preparing the Health Sector Development Project, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n13  For each convergence site, separate workshops will  be organized for different stakeholders, resulting in a \nconsolidated proposal to be finally discussed by all stakeholders of the concerned convergence site. \n14 The TCG includes the program managers of the five health sector reform areas of HSRA.
