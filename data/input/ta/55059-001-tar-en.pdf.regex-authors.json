INTRODUCTION \n \n  This  proposed  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  enhance \ninfrastructure asset management operations, including, but not limited to, energy, information and \ncommunications technology, transport, water and urban, and irrigation infrastructure in Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  through  knowledge  and \ntechnical support for project preparation and capacity development to DMCs. The TA is aligned \nwith Strategy 2030 operational priorities 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6; the Group of 20 (G20) principles of \nquality infrastructure investments; relevant Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); and the \nParis Agreement on climate change.1 \n \n  The TA was endorsed during the corporate priority framework meeting in November 2020 \nand  is  included  in  the  2021  ADB  Management-approved  results-based  workplan  of  the \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department. The TA involves infrastructure \nsectors in ADB, as well as the Finance Sector Group, the Governance Thematic Group, the \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership Thematic Group, and other thematic groups.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n  Infrastructure comprises a significant portion of ADB\u2019s investment portfolio. During 2010\u2012\n2019, lending for the transport sector was $45.06 billion or 29% of ADB lending; for the energy \nsector, $36.32 billion or 24%; for water and urban, $14.36 billion or 9%; for irrigation, $4.01 billion \nor 3%; for information and communications technology, $1.02 billion or 0.7%; and for other \ninfrastructure investments, $1.97 billion or 1%. Together, these infrastructure sectors comprise \n67% of ADB\u2019s total lending ($153.68 billion).3 ADB estimates suggest the need for significant \ninvestment totaling $1.7 trillion annually during 2016\u20132030 to address infrastructure gaps in \nDMCs, including climate change adaptation and mitigation.4 \n \n  Demand for infrastructure investment in Asia and the Pacific is projected to shift towards \noperating and maintaining existing infrastructure systems by 2030. For example, an estimated \n1.1%\u20122.1% of gross domestic product per year will be needed to maintain new and existing \ntransport infrastructure in DMCs during 2020\u20132030. This is higher than the estimated investment \nneeds for new infrastructure. Similarly, operation and maintenance investment requirements for \nwater  and  sanitation  assets  are  estimated  to  exceed  capital  investment  needs  for  new \ninfrastructure.5, \n \n  A  significant  development  challenge  exists  to  ensure  the  benefits  of  infrastructure \ninvestments are sustainable. The assets create large and long-term liabilities that challenge the \nfinancial, economic, planning, technical, and human resources capacities of DMCs. Almost 60% \n(by  number)  of  ADB\u2019s  total  completed  transport,  water  and  urban,  and  energy  sovereign \noperations validated by the Independent Evaluation Department during 2015\u20132019 were rated \n \n1  ADB. 2018.

The TA will develop and disseminate selected knowledge products \naddressing priority areas, including, but not limited to, strengthening infrastructure financing and \ncost recovery; improving infrastructure governance; and embedding lifecycle planning principles \nin the planning, design, construction, maintenance and operations of infrastructure. Capacity \nbuilding programs will include sessions targeting key stakeholders and senior decision makers to \nengender support for asset management at the highest level in DMCs. \n \n  The TA will support efforts towards accelerating digitalization of infrastructure asset data \nand leveraging digitals tools to support evidence-based decisions for planning, development, \nmaintenance, and operations of infrastructure systems. The TA will review barriers and propose \noptions for mainstreaming digital technologies such as data collection via connected sensors \n(Internet of Things); earth observation or portable devices; cloud-based data analytics; and \nartificial intelligence for real-time performance monitoring, sensing of issues, business process \nautomation, and virtualization (digital twin). \n \n  ADB estimates indicate a total of $1.7 trillion is required annually up to 2030 to address \nthe  infrastructure  gap,  including  for  climate  change  adaptation  and mitigation.  Building  on \ninfrastructure asset valuation knowledge work by ADB, the TA will promote lifecycle accounting \nat all levels (operator, local, regional or provincial, and national government) in selected sectors \nand DMCs through capacity building programs.13 If implemented correctly by DMCs, this will \nengender  transparency  in  infrastructure  investment  and  management,  lead  to  improved \ninfrastructure governance, help attract much needed private capital to tackle the significant \ninfrastructure gap, and develop quality infrastructure that is green, sustainable, resilient, and \ninclusive. \n \n  The TA will work with ongoing asset management initiatives in the operations departments \nand the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department to glean lessons to be shared \nacross operations departments and develop a body of knowledge and best practices. This will \nresult in guidance notes and other materials to support knowledge management and capacity \nbuilding for DMCs. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n  Output  1:  Identification  and  preparation  of  asset  management  initiatives  in \ndeveloping member countries supported. The TA will provide technical support for identifying \npriority opportunities for improving asset management in selected DMCs and including asset \nmanagement  in  at  least  two  country  partnership  strategies.  The  TA  will  provide  asset \nmanagement expert inputs to at least four projects during the project preparation phase to support \nthe design of asset management requirements and embed quality infrastructure investment \nprinciples in projects. The TA will also support the design of integrated asset management system \nin at least two DMCs. \n \n \n13 ADB. 2020. Guidance Note on State-Owned Enterprise Reform in Sovereign Projects and Programs. Manila. \n ", "5 \n  The TA will assess asset management maturity in selected DMCs to identify and prioritize \npotential asset management improvement opportunities. The assessment framework shall be \nadapted from international asset management frameworks, for example, as described in ISO \n55000 series of asset management standards and the International Infrastructure Management \nManual.14 The TA will also provide technical support for dialogue with DMCs towards developing \npotential future asset management project pipelines, including on the private sector\u2019s role in \naddressing asset management.  \n \n  Output  2:  Knowledge  and  capacity  of  developing  member  countries  in  asset \nmanagement improved. The TA will review good practices within ADB and internationally, and \nprepare a road map for strengthening asset management capacity in ADB operations and in \nselected DMCs. Guided by the priorities set out in the road map(s), the TA will develop and collate \nasset management knowledge products and capacity building materials for DMCs. The TA will \ndevelop at least three cross-sector infrastructure asset management knowledge products, with at \nleast one including gender-related aspects, one considering regional cooperation and integration, \nand one including innovative financing options. At least three cross-sector asset management \ncapacity  building  programs  with  at  least  thirty  participants  per  training  program  will  be \nimplemented. \n \n  ADB will use knowledge products and capacity building initiatives to embed into DMC \ninstitutions the principles, processes, strategies, and tools that are fundamental for good asset \nmanagement  including:  (i) the  G20  principles  of  quality  infrastructure  investments;  (ii) \nstrengthening sovereign and non-sovereign financing of infrastructure operation and maintenance, \nincluding recommending specific actions that will engender wider use of performance-based asset \nmanagement contracts for delivering improved level of service; and (iii) promoting application of \ndigital technologies, such as connected sensors, earth observations, smart devices, cloud-\ncomputing, geographic information systems, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality technologies \nfor improved asset management. \n \n   Capacity building programs will be mostly delivered virtually and open to participation by \nrepresentatives from all DMCs; limited face to face interaction in country training programs may \nbe provided where possible. The TA will promote asset management knowledge partnerships \nwith centers of excellence, multilateral development banks, other partners, and subregional \ngroups such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation,  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion,  and  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic \nCooperation. \n \n  This TA will support focus areas of Strategy 2030 and selected operational priorities. The \nmain direction of activities will be supporting ADB operations and DMCs through policy dialogue, \nincluding asset management initiatives in country partnership strategies, developing the pipeline \nfor infrastructure asset management assistance, and improving asset management knowledge \nand capacity. ADB\u2019s value addition includes: (i) drawing on cross-sector and thematic expertise \nunder a one ADB approach to learn lessons, share knowledge, and provide asset management \ntechnical support to DMCs; (ii) developing and disseminating relevant and practical knowledge \nproducts; (iii) supporting mainstreaming of the G20 principles of quality infrastructure investments \nin  DMCs;  and  (iv)  supporting  accelerating  digitalization  of  infrastructure  in  the  context  of \ninfrastructure asset management. \n \n \n14 ISO. 2014.
