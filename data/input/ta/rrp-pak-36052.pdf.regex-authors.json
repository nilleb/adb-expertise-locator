An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  for \nAssessment  national highways and an initial environmental examination (IEE) \nfor the other roads were undertaken. A summary EIA containing \nessential elements of both the EIA and IEE was circulated to the \nBoard 120 days prior to Board consideration of the Project. \n   \nProject Description  The Project will improve (i) the provincial road network in the \nNorth-West Frontier Province (NWFP) to increase access to the \nrural population; (ii) build capacity of the road agencies to improve \nefficiency,  sustainability,  and  safety  of  the  network;  and              \n(iii)  enhance  subregional  connectivity  by  improving  national \nhighways connecting the Afghanistan border to the Karachi ports \nand developing border-crossing infrastructure.  \n \nRationale  NWFP  is  the  poorest  of  the  four  provinces  with  a  poverty \nincidence of 44% compared with 33% for the country. The rural \nareas  of  NWFP  suffer  from  lack  of  connectivity  as  27%  of \ncommunities lack basic motor vehicle access and 68% are not \nserved  by  public  transport.  The  9,100  kilometer  (km)  road \nnetwork, of which over 4,000 km is unpaved, is in poor condition. \nThe  Government\u2019s  devolution  program  has  transferred  about \n7,000 km of roads to the newly established district governments, \nwhich lack capacity as well as resources to maintain them. \n \nThe  closest  ports  to  landlocked  Afghanistan  and  most  of  the \nCentral Asian republics (CARs) are the existing ports in Karachi \nand the under-construction port at Gwadar. The bulk of traffic from \nnorthern  Afghanistan  and  the  CARs  enter  Pakistan  at  the \nTorkham border point and use the national highways to access \nthe ports. With stability gradually returning in Afghanistan and \ngrowing bilateral trade with Pakistan, the opportunities to benefit \nfrom this corridor have significantly increased. \n \nThe  Project  is  part  of  sequenced  interventions  in  individual \nprovinces by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for integrated \ndevelopment of the national, provincial, and rural access roads \nalong with related institutional and policy reforms in the subsector. \n  These  interventions  also  support  subregional  cooperation \ninitiatives by improving international road transport corridors and \ncross-border facilities. ", "iv       \n  The Project represents the fourth intervention using this approach \nand follows the earlier road projects for the provinces of Sindh, \nPunjab, and Balochistan. \n \nObjectives  The objectives of the Project are to increase access of the rural \npopulation in NWFP to social services and markets leading to \nimproved livelihood and poverty reduction, enhance efficiency of \nthe  road  network  and  transport  in  the  province,  and  improve \nsubregional cooperation and trade by facilitating road transport to \nAfghanistan  and  the  CARs.  These  objectives  will  be  achieved \nthrough (i) provincial policy reforms and institutional strengthening \ncomponent to improve the management of road subsector and \nbuild capacity at provincial and district levels; (ii) provincial roads \nimprovement component involving rehabilitation and improvement \nof  212  km  of  provincial  highways  and  about  700  km  of  rural \naccess  roads  in  districts;  (iii)  subregional  connectivity \nimprovement component involving construction and improvement \nof  about  310  km  of  national  highways  and  border-crossing \ninfrastructure at two border points with Afghanistan; and (iv) road \nsafety  component  involving  implementation  of  a  road  safety \nprogram along selected national highway sections improved under \nthe Project, awareness campaigns and capacity building. \n \nTo  support  the  sector  reform  agenda,  the  Project  will  help  (i) \nestablish  a  road  asset  management  system,  (ii)  implement \nperformance-specific maintenance contracts, (ii) involve roadside \ncommunities  in  rural  road  maintenance  on  a  pilot  basis,  (iv) \nimprove road safety, (v) control vehicle overloading, and (vi) build \nthe capacity of provincial and district governments in road asset \nmanagement. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project is $423.6 million equivalent.

Improvement of rural access roads will be undertaken \nby  WSD\u2019s  Project  Management  Unit  and  the  District \nGovernments.  Project  directors  in  FHA,  MOC,  NHA,  and  the \nProject  Management  Unit  will  have  overall  implementation \nresponsibility. Provincial steering committee, MOC, and NHA will \nbe responsible for monitoring implementation.  \n   \nProcurement  All civil works contract packages will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement following international and \nlocal competitive bidding procedures. \n   \nConsulting Services  The  Project  will  require  international  and  domestic  consulting \nservices  for  (i)  policy  and  institutional  reforms,  road  asset \nmanagement  capacity  building,  and  project  management;  (ii) \ndetailed  engineering  and  construction  supervision/contract \nadministration for national highways; (iii) design and construction \nsupervision for provincial highways and rural access roads; and \n(iv) road safety. The consultants will be engaged using ADB\u2019s \nquality- and cost-based selection procedures and according to \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants.  \n   ", "vi       \nProject Benefits and  The Project will have a significant effect on poverty reduction, \nBeneficiaries  directly  benefiting  approximately  1,000,000  people  in  the  24 \ndistricts of NWFP living adjacent to the roads and some 500,000 \nother road users. Of these, an estimated 900,000 are poor people \nwho will be direct beneficiaries. Other people will benefit from \nlower  transport  costs  and  induced  economic  and  social \ndevelopment.  The  Project  will  generate  approximately  820,000 \nperson-months of employment opportunities for unskilled laborers. \nThe Project will have positive externalities, which will improve the \nlivelihood of the poor. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Inordinate delay in project start-up activities, such as engagement \nof consultants and procurement for civil works, including timely \napprovals by NHA and NWFP provincial government (NPG), is a \npotential  risk.  A  detailed  plan  of  preconstruction  activities  has \nbeen  prepared  in  consultation  and  agreement  with  NHA  and \nWSD-FHA as part of advance actions.  \n \nInadequate  district  maintenance  is  a  constant  risk  that  affects \nproject  sustainability.  The  Project  addresses  this  issue  by  (i) \nallowing  maintenance  to  be  undertaken  by  the  construction \ncontractor  for  up  to  10  years  for  project-financed  roads,  (ii) \nengaging rural communities to undertake routine maintenance, \nand  (iii)  building  the  capacity  of  district  staff  in  road  asset \nmanagement.  \n \nFailure  of  the  Government\u2019s  devolution  program  to  provide \nsufficient resources for maintenance will have an adverse impact \non  provincial  infrastructure  (including  roads)  that  has  been \ndevolved to the districts. However, NPG has given assurance that \nadequate resources will be provided to maintain the transferred \nroad assets once the districts\u2019 capacity is improved.  \n \nThe risks for failure or slowdown in policy and institutional reforms \nin NPG are considered manageable, as project consultants will \ncommit  and  support  NPG  and  WSD  in  introducing  the  reform \nmeasures and building capacity.  \n \nThe new cross-border access to Afghanistan is located in an area \nwhere security is an issue. While the present conditions indicate \nan  escalated  security  environment,  the  Government  has  given \nassurance that this is a temporary phase and that the security \nlevel  will  return  to  normal  by  the  time  the  project  activities \ncommence. \n \n   ", "", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  North-West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP)  Road \nDevelopment  Sector  and  Subregional  Connectivity  Project.  The  Project  Framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Roads \n \n2.  Transport is an important sector of Pakistan\u2019s economy, accounting for 10% of the gross \ndomestic product (GDP)1 and 20\u201325% of the Public Sector Development Program. Roads are \nthe predominant mode of inland transport accounting for more than 91% of passenger traffic \nand 96% of freight traffic. The total road network in the country is approximately 250,000 \nkilometers (km). This includes 8,600 km of national highways and motorways and about 95,000 \nkm of provincial roads generally categorized as highways, and secondary and access roads. \nThe remaining are paved municipal urban roads and largely unpaved tertiary roads providing \naccess to villages and remote areas. NWFP is the smallest of the country\u2019s four provinces with \nan area at 74,500 square km and population of 17.7 million.2 The provincial road network3 \nconsists of about 9,100 km, of which about 5,000 km are paved. The rural areas of NWFP are \nstill not well-connected4 and this particularly affects the poor.  \n \n3.  To improve service delivery of social and other infrastructure at the grassroots level, the \nGovernment  embarked  upon  a  major  decentralization  effort  in  2001.  As  part  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  devolution  program,  the  Communication  and  Works  Department  of  NWFP \nprovincial government (NPG), which was responsible for the provincial road network, transferred \nresponsibility of over 7,000 km of its roads to 24 newly formed district governments along with a \nmajor portion of its staff. The provincial Communication and Works Department was then \ncombined with the Public Health Engineering Department to form the Works and Services \nDepartment (WSD). The Frontier Highway Authority (FHA) was established in 2001 to look after \nmaintenance and development of the core provincial highway network of about 2,100 km \nretained by NPG. A road sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n2.  Subregional Cooperation and Connectivity \n \n4.  As  mandated  in  its  charter,  ADB  gives  high  priority  in  its  operations  to  regional \ncooperation. In South and Central Asia, ADB has been actively involved in two subregional \ncooperation initiatives: (i) the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation,5 and (ii) the \nSubregional Economic Cooperation in South and Central Asia.6 For Pakistan,7 development of \n                                                 \n1   Government of Pakistan. 2003.

", "2  \ntransport corridors8 with Afghanistan and the Central Asian republics (CARs) assumes greater \nsignificance as these are landlocked countries and the closest ports are the existing ports in \nKarachi9 and the under-construction port in Gwadar. With stability gradually returning and major \nreconstruction and development taking place in Afghanistan, bilateral trade between Pakistan \nand Afghanistan is growing quickly, approaching over $1 billion annually. To promote this trade, \ntwo additional border-crossings10 have been agreed upon: starting with the one near Miran \nShah in NWFP, south of the existing Torkham border.11 Similarly, significant progress has been \nmade in the transit trade by reducing the banned items list by half under the Afghanistan Transit \nTrade Agreement, and providing major concessions for storage of goods at the Karachi port.12  \n \n5.  The north-south national highways (N-5 and N-55)13 carry trade and transit traffic for \nAfghanistan and the CARs, and provide access to ports in the southern city of Karachi. About \n350 km shorter, the N-55 is being upgraded in three phases, with two\u2014totaling 786 km (or \n65%)\u2014already completed.14 The third phase, involving two sections in NWFP (146 km), two in \nSindh (199 km), and one in Punjab (178 km), need to be completed to fully utilize the benefits of \nthe shortened corridor, reduce vehicle operating costs, and improve road safety.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Provincial Road Network Challenges \n \n6.  In  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  devolution  program,  NPG  has  taken  major  steps  in \nrestructuring the responsibility of the provincial road network by establishing FHA to manage the \ncore highways, and decentralizing the responsibility of other roads to the districts. However, \nresource and capacity constraints, more so at the district level, will remain a major cause of \ndeteriorating road conditions and loss of road assets. NPG needs to (i) strengthen provincial \nand district road institutions and build staff capacity; (ii) improve the condition of the road \nnetwork; (iii) institute sustainable maintenance of the network through short- and long-term \nmeasures including establishment of a road asset management system, user-pays principle to \nsupplement  maintenance  resources,  and  dedicated  road  maintenance  fund  to  provide \nsustainable  financing;  (iv)  ensure  provision  of  adequate  incentive-based  resources  to  the \ndistricts for maintenance of transferred road assets; (v) introduce physical and institutional road \nsafety initiatives to reduce traffic accidents due to increased speed on the improved roads; (vi) \ninitiate axle-load controls; (vii) involve communities in road development and maintenance; (viii) \nintroduce  environmental  and  social  aspects  in  road  planning  and  development;  and  (ix) \nintroduce policies that enable private sector participation.  \n \n                                                \n8  The Karachi-Peshawar-Torkham-Kabul-Pule-Khumrie corridor leads to (i) Tajikistan through Kunduz-Shir Khan \nBandar, (ii) Uzbekistan through Mazar Sharif-Hairatan, and (iii) Turkmenistan through Shberghan-Andkhoy-Aquina. \n9  Karachi Port and Port Qasim. \n10  The existing ones are at Torkham in NWFP and Chaman in Balochistan. \n11  Current traffic volume at the Torkham border crossing reaches about 5,000 vehicles per day. \n12  Issues relating to transportation security are being addressed under ADB\u2019s Regional Transportation Security \nInitiative, 2004.    \n13  The 1,760 km Karachi-Lahore-Peshawar-Torkham highway N-5 is the primary transport artery of the country and \ncarries 60% of the port traffic and 55% of the intercity traffic. The 1,211 km Hyderabad-D.I.Khan-D.G.Khan-\nPeshawar highway N-55 is also called Indus Highway.  \n14  With assistance from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. ", "    3\n2.  Road Connectivity and Poverty Reduction \n \n7.  Providing road access to remote communities significantly improves social indicators. \nImpact studies (footnote 4) show that by providing motor-vehicle access to communities, the \nliteracy rate goes up by 68%, enrolment in primary schools and immunization increases by \n100%, infant mortality decreases by 12%, contraceptive prevalence goes up by 100%, and per \ncapita consumption increases by 10%. Improved connectivity ensures better road transport \nservices that play an important role in providing access to economic opportunities including \nlabor  and  product  markets,  helps  the  poor  overcome  geographic  isolation  and  social  and \ncultural barriers, and enables the poor to participate in community and wider decision-making. \nHence, the improvement of rural roads has a direct impact on poverty reduction.  \n \n3.  Road Safety \n \n8.  Traffic accidents and deaths along national highways in Pakistan at more than 10,000 \nfatalities  per  year  (averaging  over  30  per  10,000  vehicles)  and  150,000  injuries  are  high \ncompared with similar roads in other Asian countries15, causing economic losses of more than \n2% of GDP.16 To date, road safety initiatives have largely focused on the motorways and \nnational highways. Preliminary information from initiatives taken by the National Highway and \nMotorway Police (NHMP) shows that enforcement coupled with engineering improvements and \nvehicle monitoring has contributed significantly to reducing traffic accidents and deaths. NHMP, \nestablished  in  1997,  has  successfully  installed  systems  to  improve  road  safety  along  the \nmotorways  (412  km)  and  national  highway  N-5  (1,762  km)  in  phases.  The  Government \nrecognizes NHMP\u2019s successful performance and plans to expand its operations to cover the \nentire national highway network.  \n \n4.  Road Maintenance \n \n9.  For a network of about 8,600 km of national highways and motorways, the National \nHighway Authority (NHA) medium-term investment and maintenance plan (2002\u20132007) provides \nPRs63.9 billion for road conservation, indicating an increase in maintenance allocations from \n38% to 50% of the development budget. The plan involves prioritized highway investment and \nmaintenance for economically viable projects, and improving the balance between network \ndevelopment and conservation. NHA\u2019s road maintenance fund, established in 2000, is financed \nthrough toll revenues to ensure a stable and secure source of operation and maintenance \nfunding. Annual revenues collected in 2003 were over PRs3.6 billion. As toll revenues are \nincreasing every year, NHA has sufficient resources to maintain the network.   \n \n10.  FHA receives an average of PRs730 million annually for development of the 2,100 km \nnetwork of provincial highways it manages. This is supplemented by about PRs130 million for \nmaintenance  that  FHA  generates  mainly  from  tolls.17  These  resources  are  adequate  for \nmaintaining and gradually improving the network.  \n                                                \n15  ADB. 1992. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Islamic \nRepublic of Pakistan for the Provincial Highways Project. Manila. A survey under this project in 1998, along 1,200 \nkm of national highways in NWFP counted over 450 fatal accidents per year, amounting to 0.36 accidents per year \nper km. About 65 black spots, with more than 3 accidents per year, were registered. \n16  ADB estimates, 2004. \n17  Other major revenue sources include earnings from equipment rental, material testing, right-of-way rental charges, \nfees from roadside gas stations, and contractor\u2019s registration.  ", "4  \n11.  The resources for the 24 districts with a network of about 7,000 km were curtailed from \nPRs123 million to PRs30 million in 2002\u20132003. A significant proportion of the network is in poor \ncondition primarily due to a shortage of road maintenance funds, but also due to lack of \nadequate capacity of the district road agencies. Based on road condition information provided \nby FHA and district governments, the backlog of maintenance needs is approximately PRs2.5 \nbillion; about PRs138 million are needed annually to sustain the network.18 Discussions with \nNPG indicate that they are willing to provide the required resources if the districts develop the \ncapacity to utilize the funds properly. Hence, the districts\u2019 capacity needs to be developed; this \nwill lead to better governance and enhanced sustainability of the road network. \n \n5.  Cross-Border Facilities and Transit Facilitation \n \n12.  The  barriers  to  international  and  transit  trade  include  cumbersome  border-crossing, \ncomplicated  custom  procedures,  unnecessary  documentation  requirements,  and  poor \ninfrastructure facilities. The joint declaration signed at the end of the First Ministerial Conference \non Transport and Trade in Central and South Asia19 in August 2003 and the subsequent \nWorking Group meeting in March 2004 recognized the need for border-crossing modernization. \nThis  includes  improving  truck-parking  facilities,  cargo  inspection  sheds,  weighbridges,  and \ncommunication  and  power  facilities.  Also  recommended  were  full-time  trained  customs, \nimmigration,  phyto-sanitary,  veterinary  staff,  and  archivists;  and  facilities  for  electronic \nconnectivity, and precollection of custom duties. ADB is providing technical assistance (TA)20 to \ndevelop  a  concept,  prepare  plans,  and  complete  a  package  including  outline  design  and \nspecifications for a pilot cross-border facility to be established and operated at Chaman border \npoint. The findings of this TA, experience of the pilot facility, and efforts under the Subregional \nEconomic Cooperation in South and Central Asia21 will be used to develop the two-border \ncrossings under the Project. \n \n6.  Government Strategy \n \n13.  The Government strategy for the transport sector involves (i) providing linkages between \nthe nation's major production centers, its seaports, and railways to all parts of the country and \ngateways in neighboring countries using infrastructure that is safe and in good condition; (ii) \nproviding the rural population access to market, health, social welfare, and education centers; \nand  (iii)  supporting  evolvement  of  Pakistan  into  a  regional  transportation  hub  connecting \nlandlocked areas of neighboring countries to Pakistan's seaports and the global market. This is \nreflected in the current Public Sector Development Program that focuses on consolidating the \nnetwork, improving road conditions to lower transport costs, connecting border points with the \nports in the south to enhance regional cooperation and international and transit trade, and \nimproving the country\u2019s exports. At the provincial level, the Government\u2019s priorities focus on \nimproving the core provincial highway network linking the districts as well as providing access to \nunserved and remote areas by improving the rural access network within the districts. To \novercome weak district capacity, the Government supports strengthening the capacity of the \n                                                \n18 An independent assessment was carried out under the project preparatory technical assistance based on a \ndetailed condition/roughness survey of roads in Nowshera district. \n19  Held at Manila during 31 July\u20131 August 2003 and with participation of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and \nUzbekistan, with Iran as observer.  \n20  The TA grant of $500,000 for Cross-Border Facility and Efficient Transit Facilitation was approved under ADB. \n2003.

The new local government system also \noffers opportunities to address district road network management and cost recovery issues.  \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Support for the National Transport Policy \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update 2004\u20132006 focuses, among others, on (i) \nprovince-specific  interventions  in  transport  and  other  sectors,  (ii)  promotion  of  subregional \ncooperation  with  Afghanistan  and  the  CARs,  and  (iii)  governance  improvements  including \nsupport for the devolution program.  \n \n15.  The Government has requested ADB\u2019s assistance in formulating its transport policy. \nInitial assistance was provided in Nov-Dec 2003 for an assessment of the current transport \nsector needs, review of the previous work on policy preparation, and recommendations and \nguidelines  for  developing  a  national  policy  using  a  consultative  process  involving  all \nstakeholders.22  This  is  being  followed  up  with  an  advisory  TA  to  support  and  finalize  the \ntransport policy preparation working with a senior transport council and a working-level transport \ncoordination committee representing stakeholders. This effort will continue in parallel and will \ncomplement the proposed Government study, assisted by Japan International Cooperation \nAgency, for development of a national transport plan. \n \n8.  External Assistance \n \n16.  Pakistan has cumulatively received about $2.4 billion in external assistance for the road \nsubsector (Appendix 3). Of this, ADB has provided $1.1 billion for nine projects during 1986\u2013\n2003, the World Bank $697 million for seven projects during 1964\u20132003, and Japan Bank for \nInternational  Cooperation  $570  million  for  six  projects  during  1989\u20132001.  The  majority  of \nassistance from the World Bank has focused on the major north-south transport artery (N-5) \ncarrying over 55% of the country\u2019s intercity traffic. Japan Bank for International Cooperation\u2019s \nassistance has been focusing on the N-55 (Indus Highway), including a major tunnel, to provide \nan alternate north-south route west of the River Indus (footnote 13). \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s assistance in the road subsector in Pakistan started in 1986 with farm-to-market \nroad projects that were later expanded to include provision of access to remote rural areas. \nSince 2001, ADB has initiated sequenced interventions in individual provinces to improve the \nnational and provincial road networks along with the related institutional and policy reforms. \nThese  interventions  also  support  the  subregional  cooperation  initiatives  through  improved \ninternational road transport corridors and cross-border facilities. \n \n9.  Lessons Learned \n \n18.  During 1986\u20131996, ADB targeted development of the provincial road networks with four \numbrella-type projects that included components in each of the country\u2019s four provinces. These \nprojects aimed to improve the mobility of the rural community and their access to health, \neducation,  and  social  amenities;  provide  reliable  road  access  to  markets;  and  support \nagricultural rural development. The wide geographic dispersion of projects and large number of \ngovernment agencies was not conducive to timely implementation and pursuing the sector \nreform  agenda  with  the  provincial  governments.  Accordingly,  implementation suffered from \n                                                \n22  Ministries of finance, communications (highways and shipping), railways, defense (civil aviation), local government, \nand planning commission, and representatives of provincial road agencies.  ", "6  \nfragmented  efforts,  coordination  problems,  and  lack  of  ownership  and  commitment  by  the \nprovincial road agencies that own the bulk of the road network. \n \n19.  Addressing  the  identified  weaknesses  of  earlier  projects,  ADB  adopted  a  province-\nfocused approach integrating development of national, provincial, and rural roads within the \nprovince. During 2001\u20132003, three provincial road sector projects were approved for Sindh, \nPunjab, and Balochistan provinces.23 Extensive national and provincial policy discussions were \nheld to identify subsector issues and develop a comprehensive policy reform agenda. In view of \nthe initiatives already started by NHA, ADB agreed to include a program loan with the Sindh \nProject to support completion of the national road policy reforms. The national policy matrix \nprovided the overarching framework for development of provincial road policy reforms, as key \nelements of the reforms were equally applicable to the provinces. The policy discussions with \nthe provinces focused on these key elements and led to adoption of a program approach that \ninvolved sequenced interventions in each of the four provinces to achieve the subsector policy \nreform.  \n \n20.  The  ongoing  province-focused  road  projects  in  Balochistan,  Punjab, and  Sindh  are \nexperiencing  some  initial  start-up  delays  in  recruitment  of  consultants  and  civil  work \nprocurement that has adversely affected implementation progress. The main causes of these \ndelays are (i) frequent changes in key project staff, and (ii) lack of preparation and provision of \nadequate  resources  to  implement  advance  procurement  actions.  In  addition,  absence  of \nestablished procedures for procurement decisions result in multiple levels of clearances by the \nprovincial governments causing significant delays. All international procurement was managed \nby  the  federal  coordinating  agencies  in  implementing  earlier  umbrella  projects.  Hence  the \nprovinces lack experience in engaging international consultants and procuring civil works under \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  The  Project  addresses  these  concerns  by  (i) \npreparing a preconstruction activities action plan including a detailed schedule in consultation \nwith  the  executing  agencies,  (ii)  seeking  the  executing  agencies\u2019  assurance  for  assigning \nexperienced  staff  and  providing  adequate  resources  to  initiate  the  activities  in  the \npreconstruction activities action plan, (iii) seeking Government/NPG assurances not to transfer \nthe project staff for 3 years, or at least until civil works contracts are awarded, and (iv) seeking \nthe executing agencies assurance to engage local consultants to help them implement the \npreconstruction activities action plan at least until project consultants are engaged.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n21.  The Project is part of ADB\u2019s sequenced interventions in individual provinces to improve \nthe national and provincial road networks along with related institutional and policy reforms. The \nProject\u2019s objectives are to increase access of the rural population in NWFP to social services \nand markets leading to improved livelihoods and poverty reduction, enhance efficiency of the \nroad network and transport in the province, and improve subregional cooperation and trade by \nfacilitating road transport to Afghanistan and the CARs. These objectives will be achieved \n                                                \n23 ADB. 2001.

The Project is in accordance with the strategy outlined in the Country \nStrategy and Program Update (2004\u20132006), which focuses, among others, on province-specific \ninterventions  in  transport  and  other  sectors,  promotion  of  subregional  cooperation  with \nAfghanistan  and  the  CARs,  and  governance  improvements  including  support  for  the \nGovernment\u2019s devolution program. The Project is in line with ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation \nStrategy and Program, and also supports the Government\u2019s transport strategy. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n22.  The  Project  will  finance  (i)  provincial  policy  reforms  and  institutional  strengthening \ncomponent to improve the management of road subsector and build capacity at provincial and \ndistrict  levels;  (ii)  provincial  roads  improvement  component  involving  rehabilitation  and \nimprovement of 212 km of provincial highways and about 700 km of rural access roads in \ndistricts;  (iii)  subregional  connectivity  improvement  component  involving  construction  and \nimprovement of about 310 km of national highways and border-crossing infrastructure at two \nborder points with Afghanistan; and (iv) road safety component involving implementation of a \nroad safety program along selected national highway sections improved under the Project, \nawareness campaigns and capacity building.  \n \n1.  Provincial Policy Reforms and Institutional Strengthening Component \n \n23.  The Project will assist FHA and district governments to (i) achieve efficiency in service \ndelivery through institutional strengthening and capacity building, (ii) improve sustainability of \nthe network through road asset management involving planned maintenance and enforced axle-\nload  controls,  (iii)  supplement  provincial  resources  through  the  user-pay  principle  and \nestablishment  of  a  dedicated  road  maintenance  fund,  (iv)  involve  communities  in  road \nmaintenance, (v) improve road safety, (vi) enhance private sector involvement in financing and \nconstructing roads, and (vii) incorporate environmental and social aspects into planning road \ninfrastructure developments. The proposed policy matrix and action plan for FHA and district \nroad agencies is in Appendix 4.  \n \n24.  Extensive  policy  discussions  were  held  with  NPG  regarding  institutional  and  sector \nreforms under the Project. These reforms are based on the national framework and represents \nissues specific to the province. In view of the organizational changes that have taken place in \nmanaging the road subsector in NWFP, the policy reforms are structured separately for the \nprovincial  road  agency  (FHA)  and  the  district  road  agencies.  To  support  the  road  reform \nagenda, the Project will finance (i) consulting services, (ii) establishment of a modern road asset \nmanagement  system  (RAMS)  in  FHA  and  a  simpler  RAMS  in  selected  districts,  (iii) \nimplementation of performance-specific maintenance contracts on selected FHA roads, (iv) a \npilot effort to involve roadside communities in undertaking routine maintenance of rural roads, \n(v) an axle-load control program, (vi) assistance to promote private sector participation in road \nconstruction  and  maintenance,  (vii)  establishment  of  road  safety,  environment,  and  social \nassessment cell in FHA, and (viii) capacity building of FHA and district road agencies. \n ", "8  \n2.  Provincial Roads Improvement Component  \n \n25.  Provincial Highways. The Project will finance rehabilitation and reconstruction of five \npriority provincial highway sections totaling 212 km. The design standards are in Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n \n26.  Rural Access Roads. The Project will finance rehabilitation and reconstruction of about \n700 km of rural access roads. As with the earlier provincial road projects in other provinces, a \nsector approach will be followed for rehabilitation and reconstruction of rural access roads.24 \nNPG has identified five core roads that meet the agreed selection criteria (Appendix 5), totaling \nabout 100 km and representing the typical geophysical, environmental, and social conditions in \nthe province. Subprojects for core roads were prepared under the project preparatory TA. \nSubproject  preparation  involves  a  feasibility  study;  environmental,  social,  and  resettlement \nassessments;  detailed  engineering;  and  preparation  of  bidding  documents.  The  design \napproach and technical standards are in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n27.  The remaining about 600 km of roads will be selected during implementation based on \nthe selection criteria that involve poverty targeting, technical and economic feasibility, social \nassessment, resettlement, consideration for indigenous people, environmental considerations, \nstakeholder consultation, and availability of counterpart resources. The roads will preferably be \nselected from the 2,745 km initially proposed by the districts. Details on allocation of roads to \nthe  districts,  selection  procedure,  endorsement  of  project  financing,  involvement  of  district \nrepresentatives, eligibility criteria for districts, implementation procedures, and flow of funds are \noutlined in Appendix 6.  \n \n3.   Subregional Connectivity Improvement Component \n \n28.  National Highways. The Project will finance rehabilitation and construction of about 310 \nkm of national highways that are part of the subregional transport corridor providing access for \nAfghanistan and the CARs to the Karachi ports. This includes (i) a 192 km section of two \nnational highways (N-5 and N-55) that connect the Torkham border crossing with the Karachi \nports, and (ii) a third cross-border access to Afghanistan involving improvement of 118 km of \nroad that connects the border town of Ghulam Khan to national highway N-55 at Sarai Gambila.  \n \n29.  Except for the 46 km Peshawar-Torkham road, the other three national highway sections \nwill be improved to the technical standards outlined in Supplementary Appendix A. Traffic on the \nPeshawar-Torkham section of national highway N-5, which provides access to Afghanistan and \nthe CARs, is high and projected to increase as a result of improving bilateral trade between the \ntwo countries and international transit trade from the CARs. However, improvements to this road \nare constrained by heavily populated settlements on either side, railway lines running adjacent \nto the road, steep gradients, and sharp curves that are difficult large commercial vehicles to \nnegotiate. Accordingly, this road will be constructed on a new alignment that allows enhanced \ncapacity through four lanes and improved road geometry.  \n \n30.  Cross-Border Facilities. The Project will finance (i) improvement of infrastructure and \nfacilities at the Torkham border crossing, (ii) construction of a new cross-border facility at the \nGhulam Khan border point with Afghanistan, and (iii) supply and installation of equipment. The \n                                                \n24 NPG has adopted appropriate policies that prioritize investments for improving the road sector. WSD has been \nimplementing ADB and externally funded projects, and has the capacity to prepare, appraise, and implement a \nsector-type project. ", "    9\nfacilities include customs infrastructure; cargo inspection sheds; weighbridges; warehousing; \nparking of vehicles; and immigration, communication, and power facilities. Development of this \ncomponent will be based on the findings of the ongoing TA for cross-border development   \n(para. 14), which will also include institutional and legislative aspects to improve operations.  \n \n  4.  Road Safety Component \n \n31.  The Project will finance equipment and facilities to expand NHMP operations on the     \nN-55 and N-5 highway sections improved under the Project as a pilot safety zone for the \nprovince.25  The  Project  includes  consulting  services,  equipment,  and  capacity  building  for         \n(i) coordination and management of road safety efforts, (ii) establishment of road accident data \nsystems,  (iii)  improved  planning  and  design  of  roads  and  conduct  of  road  safety  audits,           \n(iv) improvement of hazardous locations, (v) road safety education, (vi) publicity and campaigns, \n(vii) emergency assistance to road accident victims, and (viii) road safety research. The Project \nwill  address  policy  issues  through  implementation  of  the  NWFP  Road  Safety  Action  Plan    \n(Appendix 7) designed to bring policy and institutional reforms to strengthen road safety efforts \nin the province consistent with the ongoing initiatives for national highways.  \n \n32.  The Project also supports a community road safety initiative to mitigate the risk of road \ncrashes and injury to local communities. Road safety issues that could be effectively addressed \nthrough road safety campaigns will be identified, developed, implemented, and evaluated to \nconfirm consistency and quality. Local communities will be educated on the risks they face in \nusing the road system and how they can reduce these risks. Local road users, pedestrians, \nusers of public transport, and drivers will be made aware of the rules of the road and the need to \ndrive safely. To improve road safety during construction for the project-financed civil works, the \nbidding documents will itemize the road safety measures as \u201cpaid-items\u201d in the bill of quantity to \nensure contractors\u2019 compliance. The supervision consultant will monitor its implementation, and \nthese responsibilities will be reflected in the consultant\u2019s terms of reference.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n1.  Road Asset Management and Maintenance \n \n    a.  Provincial \n \n33.  Provincially, the Project will improve the FHA road network, build capacity, establish a \nroad maintenance fund to utilize toll and other resources generated by FHA for maintenance, \nand build FHA\u2019s image as a center of excellence to sustain capacity building for the districts. To \nenable FHA to maximize the use of resources available for road maintenance, the Project will \nprovide FHA with TA, training and equipment to fully develop RAMS capability, update the road \ninventory, and undertake road condition data collection.26 The Project will also rehabilitate and \nupgrade the existing road research and material testing, and training facilities of FHA.    \n \n34.  FHA will be encouraged to move toward performance-specific maintenance contracts to \nstreamline its functioning. The Project will finance pilot efforts to initiate performance-specific \nmaintenance  contracts  on  FHA  roads.  Contract  documentation  with  specifications  will  be \n                                                \n25  This involves the D.I.Khan-Sarai Gambila-Kohat-Peshawar-Torkham highway for a total length of about 370 km. \n26  Some FHA staff acquired skills in the highway design and maintenance model (HDM)-based RAMS under an \nearlier ADB-financed project. ", "10  \ndeveloped for a 5-year period for selected FHA roads identified during implementation with ADB \napproval. The contracts will be extended if they prove successful.  \n \n35.  The Project will provide assistance to establish a dedicated provincial road maintenance \nfund; review the current sources of road maintenance funds; and identify (i) opportunities for \ncost reduction and/or more efficient use of existing resources, and (ii) new sources of revenue \nincluding  additional  user  charges.  The  medium-term road maintenance  needs  and  funding \nsources will be assessed, and a funding mechanism designed. This may include a maintenance \nfee or similar other fee for all heavy vehicles passing strategic points on NWFP\u2019s road network. \nNWFP\u2019s relatively simple road network makes a pay-as-you-go scheme feasible and would \nenable trucks to be charged based on weight, axle configuration, and distance traveled.  \n \n    b.  District  \n \n36.  The Project aims to (i) promote sustainability of the road assets improved under the \nProject;  (ii)  build  capacity  of  district  staff,  establish  good  practices  to  enhance  NPG\u2019s \nconfidence, and promote efficiency and effectiveness of districts; and (iii) supplement district \ncapacity, particularly in remote areas. This is translated into (i) allowing maintenance of project-\nfinanced rural access roads by the construction contractor for up to 10 years, (ii) building \ncapacity of district staff in road asset management, and (iii) engaging rural communities to \nundertake routine maintenance of remotely located roads. \n \n37.  Districts governments need additional resources to overcome the resource gap for road \nmaintenance.  An  initial  PRs500  million  is  needed  during  the  first  5  years  for  backlog \nmaintenance of the paved district road network, followed by about PRs250 million annually. \nBased on the historical annual allocation for NWFP roads, this is not an unusual figure as \nPRs296 million were provided in 1995/96. NPG realizes the need and is willing to provide these \nresources to the districts once the district governments acquire sufficient capacity to utilize it \nproperly. Project financing of rural access roads in districts is closely linked to the districts\u2019 \nperformance in implementing their road maintenance program (Appendix 6). \n \n38.  Establishing sophisticated district RAMS may not be feasible given current resources. A \nsimple approach based on the regular collection and comparison of road condition data would \nnevertheless provide valuable information to support the rational allocation of scarce funds. The \nProject will finance a pilot effort to collect and present road condition data in selected districts in \na form that would enable rational decision making by nontechnical district officials. The data \ncollection expertise established in FHA will be made available for the pilot activity. To ensure \nimprovement of rural access roads financed under the Project, the civil work contracts will have \nthe option to enable the contractor to maintain the road for 5\u201310 years. \n \n39.  One way of addressing the need for increased maintenance of rural access roads is to \ninvolve  the  communities  in  maintaining  the  roads  that  serve  their  villages.  Community \ninvolvement in the provision and upkeep of rural infrastructure is common in Pakistan,27 but \ncommunity road construction and maintenance has been limited to gravel roads. Convincing \ncommunities to assume the responsibility of routine road maintenance of more substantial roads \nmay be a challenge. However, if incentives are provided for the community and the proposed \nscheme is seen to be fair, this initiative could significantly supplement the capacity of the \n                                                \n27  Under a number of projects, the Sarhad Rural Support Programme is helping provide a range of community \ninfrastructure, including roads linking villages to the existing road network with full participation and stake by rural \ncommunities. Several of the project roads were initially constructed as a community initiative. ", "    11\ndistricts to maintain their networks. The Project will provide assistance to WSD and district \ngovernments to identify suitable roads, preferably remotely located, where this initiative can be \ntaken  up  under  the  Project.  This  will  involve  community  mobilization  and  training  in  road \nmaintenance  principles  by  project-assisted  non-government  organizations.  This  approach \ncomplements other efforts being piloted under the Project, and will contribute to sustainable \nmaintenance of the district road network.  \n \n2.  Capacity Building of Road Agencies \n \na.  Provincial \n \n40.  Though technically sound, FHA staff lack capacity in areas of environmental evaluation, \nresettlement and social impacts, road safety, axle-load control, and promotion of private sector \nparticipation. In addition, the existing road research and material testing facility needs to be \nrevived to help develop appropriate design and improve quality control of road development \nprojects. To address these constraints, the Project will help FHA to (i) establish a road safety \nenvironment and social assessment cell; (ii) initiate an axle-load control program; (iii) revive the \nroad research and material testing facility; and (iv) based upon the findings of the ongoing TA \n(Appendix 2), initiate a program to promote private sector investments in road development and \nmaintenance. To ensure the proposed initiatives achieve the intended purpose, a program to \nbuild the capacity of FHA staff will be developed and implemented under the Project. With initial \nassistance from the consultants, FHA capacity will be enhanced to improve its performance and \nenable it to become a center of excellence for the province, providing advice and training to the \ndistricts\u2019 road staff. In this context, FHA\u2019s existing training facility will be rehabilitated and \nupgraded to impart and sustain training to the district government staff.   \n \nb.  District  \n41.  The newly established district governments have capacity constraints. As the roles and \nresponsibilities vis-\u00e0-vis NPG are still evolving, assessment of capacity-building needs will be \nundertaken  during  implementation.  The  relatively  small  size  of  the  district  road  agencies \nrestricts  their  capacity  to  provide  all  the  functions  required.  However,  this  also  offers  an \nopportunity to outsource several functions to the private sector, following FHA\u2019s example. A \nnumber of capacity-building initiatives in governance and social sectors are already ongoing, \nsponsored by ADB and other development agencies. Therefore, capacity building under the \nProject will focus on road construction and maintenance. The force-account labor for road \nmaintenance is being phased out in the districts and an increasing proportion of maintenance \nworks are being contracted out. As a result, the role of the district road agencies will change \nfrom  construction  and  maintenance  to  planning,  management,  and  contract  administration. \nAccordingly, the Project will include capacity building in the areas of contract management, road \nasset management, environmental and social aspects, and performance monitoring. \n \n3.  Enhancing Road Improvement Benefits to Poor Communities \n \n42.  The poor in NWFP face particularly high barriers to taking advantage of the Project\u2019s \nroad development. These barriers include low levels of literacy and education, poor health \nprofiles, lack of access to safe water and sanitation, trade development skills, and marketing of \ntheir produce. The lack of rural mobility and connectivity has been shown to have a strong \npositive correlation with improved socioeconomic indicators for rural communities. Women face \nsevere social and cultural restrictions on their mobility combined with a low skill base; the \nbenefits of improved roads are less likely to make much impact on women\u2019s poverty. Social ", "12  \nsurveys show that the net benefits of road development are expected to accrue to the poor only \nif intra-village accessibility and connectivity to the main roads are improved within the project \narea. To enhance the ability of the poor and the very poor to benefit from road development, an \nadditional complementary mechanism (proposed to be financed under a $1.0 million grant from \nthe  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  [JFPR])  is  designed  to  lower  these  barriers.  The \nproposed JFPR-assisted project28 will target the barriers specifically preventing the very poor \nand poor from utilizing the road to raise themselves out of poverty. This project builds on the \nskills and experience of existing non-government and community-based organizations, and \nincludes the provision of information and linkages to existing poverty reduction programs. The \ndraft JFPR proposal is in Supplementary Appendix B. The preparation of the JFPR project will \ncontinue in parallel with the Project. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n43.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $423.6 million equivalent inclusive of civil \nworks, consulting services, equipment, incremental costs, land acquisition resettlement, taxes, \nduties, interest, and other charges (Table 1). The foreign exchange cost is estimated as $243.2 \nmillion (57.4%). The local currency cost (including taxes and duties) is estimated as $180.4 \nmillion equivalent (42.6%).

", "    13\nE.  Financing Plan \n \n44.  The Government has requested a loan of $296.2 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources (OCR) to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including \na grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per \nannum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \nThe Government also requested a loan of $5.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \n(SFR) to finance the Provincial Policy Reform and Institutional Strengthening Component. The \nloan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The Government has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility \nand ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. \n \n45.  The Government will make the loan proceeds available to NPG ($154.6 million OCR and \n$5.0  million  Special  Funds  resources),  NHA  ($136.6  million  OCR)  and  Ministry  of \nCommunications (MOC) ($5.0 million OCR) for the purposes of the Project in accordance with \nthe existing policies and practices of the Government on favorable terms and conditions. A \ndetailed financing plan is in Appendix 8 and a summary in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  Percent \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nAsian Development Bank  243.2    58.0  301.2     71 \nGovernmenta      0.0  122.4  122.4   29 \n     Total  243.2  180.4  423.6  100 \n  a Includes taxes and duties. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n46.  In line with ADB\u2019s policy to provide a higher financing percentage for projects that \naddress priority poverty concerns in economically less-developed regions, the loan will finance \n80% of the civil works for the provincial road improvement component. For civil works under the \nsubregional connectivity component, loan financing remains at 60%. Thus ADB will be financing \n71% of the overall Project. The counterpart-funding requirement for NPG is for $31.8 million, for \nNHA $88.8 million and for MOC $1.8 million.  \n \n47.  About  19%  of  the  loan  will  be  used  for  local  currency  cost  financing.  The  overall \neconomic growth rate in Pakistan has accelerated and is expected to be about 6% of GDP for \nFY2003/04.  Due  to  recent  revenue  gains  and  expenditure  restraints,  the  fiscal  deficit  is \nexpected to decrease to about 4% of GDP for FY2003/04, its lowest level in the past decade.  \nWhile this economic performance is commendable, Pakistan needs to consolidate its economic \ngains by undertaking second-generation reforms. Given its large development financing needs, \nrelatively low ratios of domestic savings and investment to GDP, manifested by the presence of \na saving-investment gap, Pakistan will continue to need external assistance to supplement its \ndevelopment activities. Given the rather limited revenue base of NWFP, local cost financing is \nnecessary,  On  completion,  the  Project  will  generate  a  revenue  stream  strengthening  the \nprovincial fiscal profile.  ", "14  \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n  1.  Project Management \n \n48.  WSD will be the Executing Agency for the two provincial components. (i), and (ii). Under \nWSD, FHA will be the Implementing Agency for the provincial policy reforms and institutional \nstrengthening component, and the provincial highway subcomponent under the provincial road \nimprovement component. The rural access roads subcomponent will be undertaken by WSD\u2019s \nProject Management Unit, which was responsible for implementing earlier ADB-financed road \nprojects in the province and the district governments (Appendix 9). WSD has already appointed \na project director. FHA needs to appoint one to coordinate and manage implementation of \nprovincial  highways  subcomponent.  The  Local  Government  Department  will  help  WSD \ncoordinate capacity building of the district road entities. \n \n49.  NPG will establish a project steering committee, chaired by the additional chief secretary \n(planning and development), to provide overall guidance and approvals required for smooth and \ntimely implementation of the Project at the provincial level. The project steering committee will \ncomprise the WSD secretary; FHA managing director; representatives of finance, planning, local \ngovernment departments, and district governments; and the project directors. They will meet at \nleast quarterly to review implementation, provide necessary approvals, and resolve coordination \nissues. The project steering committee will be responsible for approving subproject proposals \nfor rural access roads. The FHA project director will serve as the secretary.  \n \n50.  NHA  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  subregional  connectivity  improvement \ncomponent (Appendix 9). The existing Task Force on Trade and Facilitation29 under the Ministry \nof Commerce will provide guidance for planning improvements and operations of the cross-\nborder facilities. NHA will appoint a project director to coordinate and manage implementation of \nthe physical infrastructure.   \n \n51.  MOC will be the Executing Agency for the road safety component (Appendix 9). MOC \nwill appoint a project director to coordinate with NHMP for implementing the pilot road safety \nzone subcomponent. MOC will also coordinate with FHA, NHA, and WSD for capacity building \nin road safety and help them comply with the provincial road safety policy matrix and action \nplan.  \n \n  2.  Implementation Period \n \n52.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years, including preconstruction activities. It is \nscheduled for completion by December 2010. The first phase of contract packages for national \nand provincial highways and core rural access roads will be awarded by the middle of 2005, the \nsecond phase by the end of 2005, and the third phase consisting of only rural access roads by \nthe end of 2006. A detailed implementation schedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n  3.  Advance Action \n \n53.  ADB has approved advance action for commencing engagement of consultants and \nprocurement of civil works. This will allow the executing agencies to initiate procurement actions \n                                                \n29  Chaired by the joint secretary (trade), MOC, the task force includes members from the ministries of commerce, \ncommunication, and interior; NHA; National Logistic Cell; Central Board of Revenue; and other public agencies; \nand representatives of the private sector.  ", "    15\nat an early stage. A detailed schedule outlining all preconstruction activities is in Supplementary \nAppendix  C.  The  schedule  is  supported  by  an  action  plan  with  target  dates  to  guide  the \nexecuting  agencies  in  sequencing  the  activities  and  monitoring  progress.  The  executing \nagencies have initiated advance actions for engaging consultants and civil works procurement. \n \n4.  Procurement \n54.  Goods and related services and civil works will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. All contracts for civil works and supply of equipment will be divided \ninto suitable contract packages (Appendix 11). The civil works contracts with an estimated value \nexceeding $3 million will be awarded following international competitive bidding procedures. \nCivil work contracts valued at $3 million or less will follow local competitive bidding procedures \nacceptable to ADB. For equipment contracts in excess of $500,000, international competitive \nbidding  procedures  will  be  followed;  for  contracts  ranging  from  $100,000  to  $500,000, \ninternational shopping procedures will be used; and for contracts valued at less than $100,000 \ndirect purchase procedures will be followed.  \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n55.  Consulting  services,  both  international  and  domestic,  will  be  required  to  assist  the \nexecuting  agencies  implement  the  Project.  FHA  will  engage  an  international  consultant  in \nassociation  with  domestic  consultant(s)  to  assist  and  provide  technical  expertise  in \nimplementing the policy reform and institutional strengthening component, including capacity \nbuilding. In addition, the consultant will help FHA and WSD implement the road policy matrix \nand  action  plan,  and  coordinate  and  manage  project  implementation.  The  scope  includes \nsupport and capacity building in project management; road maintenance; development of a road \nasset management system; environmental and social aspects of road development; and support \nservices to the Project Management Unit, including preparation of subproject proposals for rural \naccess roads in a format acceptable to ADB, benefit monitoring and evaluation, and road safety. \nThe  consultants  will  also  help  the  executing  agencies  monitor  and  verify  compliance  with \nresettlement action plans and environment management plans. The estimated inputs are 64 \nperson-months of international and 180 person\u2013months of domestic consulting.  \n \n56.  Under the provincial road improvement component: (i) FHA will engage an international \nconsulting  firm  in  association  with  domestic  consultant(s)  for  design  and  construction \nsupervision of the provincial highways; and (ii) WSD will engage two domestic consulting firms \nfor design and construction supervision of the rural access roads. The estimated staffing inputs \nare 63 person-months of international and 2,990 person-months of domestic consulting. Under \nthe subregional connectivity improvement component, NHA will engage an international firm in \nassociation with domestic consultant(s) for design and construction of the national highways. \nThe  estimated  inputs  are  74  person-months  of  international  and  1,336  person-months  of \ndomestic consulting. These consultants will also be responsible for detailed engineering and \nconstruction supervision of the cross-border facilities at Torkham and Ghulam Khan. For the \nroad safety component, MOC will engage international consultant (about 12 person-months) in \nassociation  with  domestic  consultant  (about  67  person-months).  For  consulting  services \ninvolving design and contract administration, the Project will provide furnished office facilities, \nutilities, vehicles, and equipment required by the consultant. For construction supervision, field \noffices, material-testing laboratories with utilities and vehicles required by supervision staff will \nbe provided through the construction contracts, as appropriate.  ", "16  \n57.  All consultants financed under the loan will be selected and engaged using ADB\u2019s quality \nand cost-based selection procedures for recruiting firms under full technical proposals and \nADB\u2019s procedures for recruiting individual consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants, and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants. Summary terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n   \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n58.  Loan funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(January  2001),  and  Interim  Guidelines  for  Disbursement  Operations,  LIBOR-Based  Loan \nProduct (July 2002). For civil works, and procurement of equipment and consulting services \nrequiring international competitive bidding, loan funds will be disbursed using direct payment \nand reimbursement procedures. For civil works using local competitive bidding procedures and \nexecuting agencies\u2019 incremental expenditures, reimbursement procedures will be through the \nimprest account. MOC, NHA, and WSD will each operate imprest accounts established in the \nNational Bank of Pakistan. The combined initial advance to the imprest account will not exceed \nthe estimated expenditures for 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. Based \nupon assessment of their capacity, FHA and the districts will operate second generation imprest \naccounts established in the National Bank of Pakistan with an initial advance not to exceed 6 \nmonths expenditure and not to exceed WSD\u2019s share of imprest funds. WSD will be responsible \nfor  monitoring  the  FHA  and  districts  imprest  accounts,  including  monthly  reconciliation  of \naccounts and preparation of withdrawal applications for liquidation/replenishment of accounts. \nStatement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be  used  for  individual  payments  not  exceeding \n$100,000. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n59.  MOC, NHA, and WSD will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify \nthe goods and services financed from the loan proceeds, the expenditures incurred for the \nProject and the subprojects, and use of local funds. These project accounts and related financial \nstatements will be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by the Auditor \nGeneral or independent private auditors acceptable to ADB. In addition, the audit should include \na separate opinion on the use of imprest accounts with the statement of expenditure procedure. \nThe  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  within  9  months  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year \nconsolidated annual audited reports and related financial statements of the Project. The director \ngeneral of audits will coordinate all account activities and ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s audit \nand accounting requirements. ADB will review and follow up on these matters as necessary.   \n \n60.  For  transparency  and  objective  and  independent  assessment,  all  procurement  and \ndisbursement-related  activities  will  be  subject  to  independent  performance  audits.  Loan-\nfinanced consulting services engaged through international competitive bidding procedures will \nconduct the performance audit biannually. ADB will also conduct project procurement audits as \npart of its regular loan reviews. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n61.  MOC, NHA and WSD, with the assistance of the Project Management Unit and policy \nand institutional development consultant, will each establish a project performance management \nsystem by conducting surveys for baseline data of traffic, and socioeconomic and other relevant \nparameters for the project roads. The system will be developed in compliance with ADB\u2019s \nProject Performance Management Systems Handbook. Baseline surveys will be followed by ", "    17\nregular annual surveys. The findings and supporting data will be incorporated in the project \ncompletion report. The data on implementation status will help with project monitoring as well as \nearly identification of potential problems. Performance indicators will be based on the project \nframework to identify attainment of the development objectives. \n \n  9.  Project Reviews \n \n62.  In addition to regular reviews by ADB staff at least annually, the Project will have a \ndetailed midterm review. The review will identify any problems or weaknesses in implementation \narrangements, and agree on any changes needed to achieve the Project\u2019s objectives. The \nreview will also address any procurement, financing, and scheduling problems. The midterm \nreview will be carried out by the end of the second year of implementation (last quarter of 2006). \nTwo months before the review, the executing agencies (MOC, NHA and WSD) will submit to \nADB a detailed status report on project implementation. Terms of reference for the midterm \nreview will be included in the project administration memorandum to be prepared by ADB\u2019s \ninception mission for the Project.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Analysis \n \n63.  The  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Economic \nAnalysis of Projects and using the highway development and management (HDM4) software. \nThe principal quantifiable benefits from the Project are savings on vehicle operating costs, \nincluding time-savings for existing and generated traffic. The economic analysis of the project \nroads (Appendix 12) shows that the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for all project roads \nexceeds 12%. The EIRR of the national highways ranges from 17% to 33%; the provincial \nhighways from 18% to 29%, and the five core rural access roads from 16% to 30%. The \nsensitivity analysis indicates that the EIRRs for all evaluated roads are quite robust for a 20% \nincrease in capital cost, 20% decrease in benefits, delays in implementation and 5% reduction \nin growth rate. Benefits will also arise from improved access to markets, which will boost \nagricultural economic activities; reduced agricultural input costs because of better transport \nfacilities; improved access to health, education, and other social sector facilities; and increased \nsubregional  benefits  arising  from  improved  trade  facilitation  and  reduced  delays  at  border \ncrossings. The extent of these impacts has not been quantified in the analysis.  \n \nB.  Social Impact \n \n1.  Poverty and Socioeconomic Impact \n \n64.  NWFP is the poorest of the country\u2019s four provinces with a poverty incidence of 44% \ncompared with the country\u2019s 33%. Much of the poverty reduction impacts have occurred in \nurban areas, but urban poverty at 31% and rural poverty at 47% remain higher than the national \naverage. Poverty in the project areas is associated with larger household sizes, lack of basic \nservices, asset ownership, and low education and literacy status. A vast majority (51%) of \ncommunities living adjacent to the project roads can be classified as poor with an average \nhousehold size of over 9. Within the project influence area, most people (89%) derive their \nlivelihoods from nonagricultural work, with 49% living in katcha houses and lacking access to \nsafe drinking water and proper sanitation facilities. Villages either have no basic road links to the \nmain roads or the existing roads are in poor condition and mostly inaccessible for transport \nservices. Household survey results reveal that 40% of villagers have to travel 6\u201310 km to reach ", "18  \na basic health unit. The literacy levels are low at 37%; and female children have less access to \neducation, health care, and nutrition. The socioeconomic survey of the candidate roads reveals \nthat on average 70% of households in the affected area have a per capita income of less than \nPRs750 per month\u2014the official poverty level (footnote 1). The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 13. A detailed poverty and social assessment is in Supplementary \nAppendix E. \n \n2.  Poverty Impact Ratio \n65.  The Project will reduce poverty by lowering the transport costs for the poor traveling to \nagricultural  and  labor  markets,  health  and  education  centers,  and  other  social  and  public \nservices. According to the poverty assessment, the Project will have a significant effect on \npoverty reduction, directly benefiting approximately 1,000,000 people in up to 24 districts living \nadjacent to the roads and some 500,000 other road users. Of these, an estimated 900,000 are \npoor people who will be direct beneficiaries. Other people will benefit from lower transport costs \nand induced economic and social development. The estimated poverty impact ratios of the core \nroads range from 26% to over 100% of the net economic benefits accruing to the poor for the \nProject as a whole, with most roads between 30% and 50% (Appendix 12). The Project will \ngenerate  significant  employment  opportunities  for  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  during  its \nimplementation phase. Unskilled laborers (males and females) will be employed directly in road \nconstruction  and  maintenance,  and  indirectly  by  providing  materials  and  services  for  the \nconstruction  and  maintenance  activities.  The  Project  will  generate  approximately  820,000 \nperson-months  of  unskilled  labor  employment  opportunities.  The  Project  will  have  positive \nexternalities, which will improve the livelihood of the poor.  \n \n3.  Gender \n \n66.  The prevalent gender role ideologies define women\u2019s roles as being primarily within the \nhome as mothers and wives, and men\u2019s roles as the breadwinner and decision-maker. The \nGovernment\u2019s Ministry of Women\u2019s Development has been making efforts to support gender \nthrough a Gender Policy announced in 2002. The policy aims to support the development and \nempowerment of women by improving socioeconomic indicators, developing skills, increasing \nemployment opportunities, and supporting microcredit facilities. Despite fairly profound changes \nin the status of women over the past decades, significant gender gaps in education and health \npersist. Female literacy is 37% compared with 62% for men,30 and women make up only 28.9% \nof university students. The low health status of women is the result of women's lower social, \neconomic,  and  cultural  standing.  Social  and  familial  control  over  women,  their  economic \ndependence on men, and restrictions on their mobility determine differential access of males and \nfemales to health services. The rigid gender roles and restrictions on women\u2019s mobility and \noccupational segregation have resulted in extremely low women\u2019s labor force participation rates \nat 14.4% compared with 70.3% for men (footnote 33). As a result, women\u2019s use of the road \nnetwork is significantly less than men\u2019s. The Project will provide benefits to women as a result of \nreduced road user costs in the form of lower fares and charges as for other users. It will \nfacilitate the empowerment of women through the influence of outside ideas and approaches as \nconnectivity with the rest of the country and regions improves. However, gender issues cannot \nbe addressed in a road project in totality. The complementary JFPR project (para. 42) includes \nmeasures that will encourage efforts to raise women out of poverty.  \n \n                                                \n30 Bureau of Statistics. 2003: Pakistan Labor Force Survey (2001\u20132002). Islamabad. ", "    19\n4.  Indigenous Peoples \n \n67.  The initial poverty and social assessment indicates that indigenous people or ethnic \nminorities  will  not  be  adversely  affected  by  the  Project.  Hence,  an  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment plan is not required. The Project will have a positive impact on the lives of ethnic \npopulation groups, who have distinct customs and economic lives, but are well represented at \nthe  national  and  provincial  public  representation  institutions  and  actively  participate  in \nmainstream economic, political, and social life of the province and country.  \n \n5.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n68.  The Project was designed to minimize the need for land acquisition and involuntary \nresettlement. A full census was conducted of all the people, land, and structures/assets on the \nright-of-way for all national and provincial highways and the five core rural access roads. The \nProject  will  require  acquisition  of  approximately  466  hectares  of  land,  and  will  affect  940 \nhouseholds (about 13,590 people). The estimated cost for land acquisition and resettlement is \nabout $18.1 million, of which $16.7 million is for the national highways and $1.4 million for the \nprovincial roads. Accordingly two separate resettlement plans have been prepared for NHA and \nWSD-FHA.  These  have  been  translated  into  local  languages  and  disclosed  to  the  people \naffected. A combined resettlement plan summarizing both NHA and provincial resettlement \nplans is attached as Supplementary Appendix F. The complete resettlement plans will be \npublicly available at NHA, WSD-FHA, ADB's Pakistan Resident Mission, and on the NHA and \nADB websites. A resettlement framework (Supplementary Appendix G) will be applicable for all \nrural access road subprojects approved during implementation. Resettlement plans for each \nremaining subprojects will be prepared and approved by NPG, and submitted to ADB for \napproval. \n \n6.  HIV/AIDS31 \n \n69.  According  to  the  World  Health  Organization  and  Joint  United  Nations  Program  on \nHIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), Pakistan has a low prevalence but is a high-risk country for the spread of \nHIV  infection.  In  1999-2000  the  Government  with  the  assistance  of  UNAIDS  and  other \ndevelopment partners undertook a strategic planning exercise with input from stakeholders. \nUnder the strategic framework that resulted, the HIV/AIDS Prevention Project uses a multisector \nresponse to decrease the vulnerability of Pakistan\u2019s population. Included in this project is a 5-\nyear  service  package  for  long  distance  truckers  and  associated  population  that  includes \nawareness raising. Under the Project, NHA and WSD will develop linkages with the National \nAIDS  Control  Programme,  and  in  particular  work  with  truckers  to  ensure  cooperation  and \nsupport for the HIV/AIDS Prevention Project along national highways in NWFP. This linkage will \nnot only encourage awareness-raising of HIV/AIDS issues, but will ensure that implementation \nof the service package for truckers fits in appropriately with road construction timing in NWFP. \n \nC.  Environmental Impacts and Measures \n \n70.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines 2003 and Pakistan \nEnvironmental Assessment Regulation 2000, the Project as a whole is categorized as \u201cA.\u201d More \nspecifically, (i) the rehabilitation and construction of 310 km national highways including the \nproposed realignment of the Peshawar-Torkham road section is categorized as an A project, \nand (ii) the improvement and rehabilitation of the provincial highways and rural access roads are \n                                                \n31 human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. ", "20  \ncategorized  as  a  B  project.  Both  the  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  and  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)32  were  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.  A \nsummary EIA including key elements of both the EIA and IEE was circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of \nDirectors and disclosed to the public more than 120 days prior to the Board\u2019s consideration of \nthe Project.  \n \n71.  The findings of EIA and IEE confirm that none of the Project roads are located in or \naffect any designated protected area, and no environmentally and ecologically sensitive areas \nare involved under the Project. The environmental impacts associated with the rehabilitation and \nimprovement of the Project roads will occur only during construction. However, these impacts \nare manageable and appropriate mitigation measures will be incorporated into project design \nand construction works. If the rural access roads selected during implementation provide access \nto environmentally sensitive areas leading to potentially negative impacts such as poaching and \nlogging, the IEE proposes that the forest and wildlife departments be part of the monitoring \nprocess under the environmental management and monitoring plan. The cost for mitigation and \nimplementation  of  the  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  for  the  national \nhighways is PRs1,873 million, of which PRs1,798 million is included in the construction costs \nand a separate allocation of PRs75 million is provided under the Project. For the provincial \nhighways and rural access roads, the cost for mitigation measures and the environmental \nmanagement and monitoring plan is PRs58 million, of which PRs31 million is provided under \nconstruction and consulting services costs and the remaining PRs27 million is covered under \nthe incremental cost.   \n \n72.  NHA  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  environmental  management  and \nmonitoring plan for national highways,33 FHA for the provincial highways, and WSD for the rural \naccess roads. These agencies will work closely with the federal and provincial environmental \nprotection agencies, other relevant government agencies, and local communities to ensure that \nthe environmental impacts of the Project are mitigated and monitored. \n \nD.  Project Risks \n73.  Inordinate delays in project start-up activities such as engagement of consultants and \nprocurement for civil works including timely approvals by NHA and NPG are a potential risk. In \nconsultation and agreement with NHA and WSD-FHA as part of advance actions, a detailed \nplan of preconstruction activities has been prepared.  \n \n74.  Failure  of  the  Government\u2019s  devolution  program  to  provide  sufficient  resources  for \nmaintenance will have an adverse impact on the provincial infrastructure (including roads) that \nhas been devolved to the districts. NPG has given assurance that adequate resources will be \nprovided to maintain the transferred road assets once the districts\u2019 capacity is improved. In \naddition, the Project addresses this issue by (i) allowing maintenance to be undertaken by the \nconstruction  contractor  for  up  to  10  years  for  project-financed  roads,  (ii)  engaging  rural \ncommunities to undertake routine maintenance, and (iii) building capacity of district staff in road \nasset management.   \n \n                                                \n32  Two environmental reports are prepared due to different executing agencies for the national highways and \nprovincial roads.  \n33  The World Bank is financing long-term development of NHA\u2019s environmental capacity through its Highway \nRehabilitation Project, approved in November 2003. ", "    21\n75.  The  risks  for  failure  or  slowdown  in  policy  and  institutional  reforms  in  NPG  are \nconsidered manageable, as project consultants will commit and support NPG and WSD in \nintroducing the reform measures and building capacity. \n \n76.  The new cross-border access to Afghanistan is located in an area where security is an \nissue. While the present conditions indicate an escalated security environment, the Government \nis closely monitoring the situation and has given assurance that this is a temporary phase and \nthat the security level will return to normal by the time the project activities commence. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n77.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n78.  Resettlement. NHA and NPG will implement land acquisition and resettlement activities \nin accordance with all applicable laws and regulations of the Government and in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement as set forth in the agreed resettlement plans (NHA \nfor national highways, and WSD for provincial highways and core rural access roads) and \nresettlement framework (WSD for noncore rural access roads). \n \n79.  Environment. NHA and WSD will ensure that all environmental mitigation measures \nidentified in the environmental impact assessment report for the national highway and initial \nenvironmental  examination  report  for  the  provincial  highway  and  rural  access  roads  are \nincorporated into the project design and implemented during project construction and operation \nand maintenance, in accordance with the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines as \nset forth in Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) and the environmental management \nand monitoring plan agreed to with ADB. \n \n80.  Anticorruption.  MOC,  NHA  and  NPG  acknowledge  that  ADB,  consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  reserves  the  right  to \nundertake directly, or through its agents, investigation of any possible financial or management \nimpropriety in the conduct of the Project. MOC, NHA, NPG, and WSD will fully cooperate with \nany such investigation and extend all necessary assistance, including access to all relevant \nbooks and records, as well as engagement of independent experts who may be needed for \nsatisfactory completion of such investigations. All costs related to such investigations will be \nborne by the Project.   \n \n81.  Labor Laws. NHA and WSD will ensure that the civil works contractors comply with all \napplicable  labor  laws  and  regulations,  and  do  not  employ  child  labor  in  the  construction \nactivities.  NHA  and  WSD  will  provide  equal  opportunities  for  women  in  road  construction \nactivities, as well as require contractors to not differentiate wages between men and women for \nwork  of  equal  value.  A  reputable  non-government  organization  may  be  appointed  to \nindependently monitor and report on such matters. \n \n82.  Health Risks and Provisions. NHA and WSD will ensure that the civil works contracts \ninclude  a  requirement  to  conduct  an  information  and  education  campaign  on  sexually \ntransmitted and other communicable diseases for construction workers as part of the health and \nsafety program at campsites during the construction period. NHA and WSD will ensure that the \ncivil  works  contracts  include  provisions  on  health;  accidental  death;  dismemberment  and ", "22  \ndisability benefits; safety and security; sanitation; and appropriate working conditions, including \naccommodation, and safe drinking water for construction workers at campsites at standards \nacceptable to ADB during the construction period. \n \n83.  Illegal Trafficking of Women, Children, and Goods. The Government will ensure that \nNHA and WSD enact measures, satisfactory to ADB, to prevent, monitor, detect, and arrest \nillegal trafficking of women and children, and illegal movement of plants, wildlife, contraband, \nand other prohibited goods.  \n \n84.  Grievance and Redress Mechanism. NHA and WSD will form within 3 months of the \ndate of loan effectiveness an independent committee comprising individuals unrelated to the \nProject to hear any grievances or other complaints relating to resettlement or any other issues. \nThe  formation  of  the  committee  will  be  announced  through  the  public  media,  including \nannouncements in all major local language newspapers. The committee will be required to hold \na public hearing of any such grievances or complaints filed with it.  \n \n85.  Institutional  Strengthening.  Each  of  NPG  and  WSD-FHA  will  undertake  a \ncomprehensive capacity-building program including training and advisory services to enhance \nthe  managerial,  technical,  road  maintenance,  and  monitoring  capacities  of  district  staff \nresponsible for project implementation and maintenance of district road networks. FHA will also \nestablish a road safety, environment, and social assessment cell to address issues relating to \nroad safety, environmental impacts, and social assessment. \n \n86.  Road Maintenance. NHA and NPG will each prepare and implement appropriate road \nmaintenance procedures and annual maintenance plans for the roads improved under the \nProject. NHA and NPG will each implement axle-load controls on the improved roads. To \nmaintain the network of road assets transferred to the districts, NPG will provide (i) PRs150 \nmillion annually to the districts to prevent deterioration of the network, and (ii) PRs500 million \nannually for 5 years to bring the network to maintainable condition.  \n \n87.  Project Management. MOC, NHA and WSD will each select project directors on the \nbasis of open competition, and recruit candidates as project directors who demonstrate the \nhighest technical and organizational competence. In the interest of providing continuity for \nproject management, each project director will serve in the position appointed for a minimum of \n3 years from the date of appointment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any project \ndirector may be removed in case of gross dereliction of duties or such other serious cause, \nprovided such a determination is made through appropriate due process. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n88.  The Government, NHA, and NPG will have approved the Project through approval of the \nPlanning Commission Pro Forma I (PC-I) at the provincial and federal levels. \n \nC.  Conditions for Disbursement \n89.  No  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  for  civil  work  contracts  until  the  supervisory \nconsultants for national highways, provincial highways, and rural access roads, as appropriate, \nhave been engaged. \n ", "    23\nVI.

Road Network and Administration \n \n1.  Roads are the predominant mode of inland transport in Pakistan, carrying more than \n91% of passenger traffic and 96% of freight traffic. The average traffic growth rate is about 4.5% \nfor passengers and 10.5% for freight. The total road network in the country is approximately \n250,000 kilometers (km), of which about 60% is paved. This percentage includes 8,600 km of \nnational highways and motorways representing the main transport corridors and providing inter-\nprovincial linkages and connections to neighboring countries; and about 95,000 km of provincial \nroads  providing  all-weather  access  to  the  economic  and  population  centers  in  the  four \nprovinces. The provincial roads are generally categorized as highways, and secondary and \naccess roads. The remaining network consists of mostly paved municipal urban roads, and \nlargely unpaved tertiary roads providing access to villages and remote areas. The number of \nregistered motor vehicles is 4.8 million and is growing at 8% annually. Road transport services \nare largely in the private sector and are subject to strong competition. \n \n2.  With responsibility for operation, maintenance, and development of the national highway \nsystem, the National Highway Authority (NHA) is an autonomous agency with a functional \nstructure  and  decentralized  implementation  through  provincial  offices.  The  provincial \ncommunications and works department (CWD) were responsible for the provincial roads, but \nwith the Government\u2019s devolution program, the bulk of the provincial network was transferred to \nthe newly established district governments. The rest of the road network consisting of the \nprimary  provincial  arteries  was  handed  over  to  the  newly  formed  works  and  services \ndepartments that will manage and develop all public infrastructure projects such as roads and \nwater supply. The local governments in urban centers are responsible for municipal roads, and \nthe district governments for tertiary roads.  \n \nB.  Road Subsector Revenues and Expenditures \n \n3.  Through  a  combination  of  general  revenue  taxes  and  user  charges  over  5  years    \n(1995\u20132000), the road subsector raised PRs207 billion in revenues. National and provincial \nhighway expenditures totaled PRs118 billion for that period. The balance of PRs89 billion (43%) \nwas contributed to the Government\u2019s general revenue. In FY2002/03, the economic survey \nreported expenditure of PRs13.2 billion for the national highway network and PRs7.1 billion for \nthe remaining network. But expenditure on road maintenance was estimated to be only 30% of \nthe requirements. NHA\u2019s medium-term investment and maintenance plan (2002\u20132007) provides \nPRs127.2 billion for road development and PRs63.9 billion for road conservation. The plan \ninvolves prioritized highway investment and maintenance for economically viable projects, and \nimproving the balance between network development and conservation. \n \nC.  Road Subsector Issues \n \n4.  Road Infrastructure and Maintenance. Based on assessments of road conditions, \nabout  half  of  the  national  highway  network  and  a  large  proportion  of  the  provincial  road \nnetworks are in poor condition. Deterioration levels on provincial roads are relatively severe \ncompared  with  those  on  national  highways.  The  Government  has  initiated  a  program  for \nrehabilitating priority highway sections with assistance from the World Bank and the Asian ", "28   Appendix 2 \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in addition to Government resources.1 For the provincial highways \nand district roads, ADB is financing sequenced interventions in each province to rehabilitate and \nimprove  road  networks.  To  ensure  sustainability,  these  projects  also  support  policy  and \ninstitutional reforms and capacity building for the road agencies.          \n \n5.  NHA receives Government resources that are supplemented by toll revenues. NHA\u2019s \nroad maintenance fund, established in 2000, is financed through toll revenues to ensure a \nstable and secure source of operation and maintenance funding. Annual revenues collected in \n2003  were  over  PRs3.6  billion.  As  toll  revenues  increase  every  year,  NHA  has  sufficient \nresources  to  maintain  the  network.  The  provincial  and  district  maintenance  resources  are \ndiscussed in paras. 12 and 13.   \n  \n6.  Vehicle Overloading. Vehicle overloading is a major cause of premature deterioration \nof  roads  in  Pakistan.  Damage  to  the  pavement  caused  by  overloaded  vehicles  increases \nexponentially following the fourth power law. Thus, if axle load is doubled, damage to the \npavement will be 16 times. A study by the National Transport Research Center2 has shown that \nover 43% of vehicles exceed the legal axle-load limit mandated by the Road Safety Act of 2000. \nTwo-axle trucks contribute most to overloading, which is increasing at about 2.6% annually. \nAlthough the proportion of two-axle trucks now shows a downward trend, they still represent \nover 50% of the truck traffic on the roads. To prevent damage to the road pavement, overloaded \nvehicles need to be monitored and axle load control enforced by weigh stations using static and \nweigh-in-motion measuring devices. NHA is implementing a nationwide axle-load program.3 \n \n7.  Road Safety. Traffic accidents and deaths along national highways in Pakistan \u2013 more \nthan 10,000 fatalities per year (averaging more than 30 per 10,000 vehicles) and 150,000 \ninjuries \u2013 are high compared with those on similar roads in Asian countries.4 The number of \ntraffic accidents and deaths has been growing in recent years with the increase in the number of \nvehicles on the roads. The improvement of major national highways also contributes to the \nnumber of traffic accidents and deaths due to overspeeding, with 50% of these accidents \noccurring  along  the  national  highways.  Without  road  safety  initiatives,  the  accidents  are \nexpected to increase. Economic losses are estimated at more than 2% of the national gross \ndomestic product.5 There is no centralized data collection and analysis on traffic accidents and \ndeaths at the provincial level in Pakistan.  \n \n8.  To  date,  road  safety  initiatives  have  been  confined  to  the  motorways  and  national \nhighways. Preliminary information from initiatives taken by the National Highway and Motorway \nPolice (NHMP) shows that enforcement coupled with engineering improvements and vehicle \nmonitoring  has  significantly  reduced  traffic  accidents  and  deaths.  NHMP  has  successfully \ninstalled systems to improve road safety along the motorways (412 km) and national highway  \nN-5 (1,760 km) in phases. NHMP services along the motorways include ambulances with \nparamedics, mobile workshops with mechanics, emergency telephones along the road, and \nbriefing to commuters at entry points of motorways. They use modern traffic enforcement and \n                                                \n1  Rehabilitation of national highway N-5 is financed with World Bank assistance, and N-25 and N-55 with Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s assistance.  \n2  National Transport Research Center. 1994.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Islamic \nRepublic of Pakistan for the Provincial Highways Project. Manila. A survey under this project in 1998, along 1,200 \nkm of national highways in NWFP, counted over 450 fatal accidents per year, amounting to 0.36 accident per year \nper km. About 65 black spots, with more than 3 accidents per year, were registered. \n5  ADB estimates, 2004. ", "  Appendix 2  29\nemergency relief equipment such as laser guns, video radar, video cameras, rescue vans, and \nemergency signboards. Through effective training and proactive organizational reforms, NHMP \nhas been able to achieve a highly motivated and dedicated team of officers at each patrol post, \ncommanded by a chief patrol officer. The officers register violations without actually disturbing \ntraffic as the documents and fines are not collected at the site. The successful performance of \nNHMP has been recognized and the plan is to expand its operations to cover the entire national \nhighway network.  \n \n9.  Private Sector Participation. A large investment in infrastructure, particularly roads, is \nneeded to maintain and enhance economic growth, which is necessary for reducing poverty and \nunemployment. The existing resource base is inadequate to meet the road development needs, \nand investment from the private sector is necessary to fill the resource gap. Although several \ninitiatives, mostly at the national level, were taken to attract private sector investments in the \nroad sector, none were successful primarily because of lack of (i) an enunciated policy on \nprivate  sector  participation,  (ii)  appropriate  institutional  structures  and  processes,  (iii) \nestablished  systems  and  procedures,  and  (iv)  capable  staff.  The  capacity  to  promote \ninfrastructure projects is limited. In addition, lack of financial expertise leads to difficulties in \npackaging  projects  that  could  be  successfully  offered  for  private  sector  financing.  ADB  is \nproviding technical assistance for preparing a public-private infrastructure financing facility6 to \nhelp design appropriate mechanisms for accelerating infrastructure development by increasing \nprivate sector participation in Pakistan.   \n \nD.  North-West Frontier Province \n \n10.  Road Network and Connectivity. At 74,500 square km, North-West Frontier Province \n(NWFP) is the smallest of the four provinces. The landscape features high mountains in the \nnorth, strips of plains and plateau in the center, and plains in the south. The population of the \nprovince is 17.7 million.7 The province\u2019s road network8 consists of about 9,100 km, of which \nabout 5,000 km are paved (Table A2.1). Lack of connectivity9 in the rural areas of NWFP \nparticularly affects the poor. Though the network coverage is better than that in Balochistan and \nSindh, only 41% of the rural communities have paved access and 27% still lack basic motor-\nvehicle access. NWFP lags behind the other provinces in availability of public transport, as only \n32% of communities are served by public transport compared with the national average of 48%.  \n \n11.  Impact of Devolution. To improve delivery of social and other infrastructure at the \ngrassroots level, the Government embarked on a major decentralization effort in 2001. As part \nof the  devolution program, CWD of the NWFP government, which was responsible for the \nprovincial road network, transferred responsibility for over 7,000 km to the 24 newly formed \ndistrict governments along with a major portion of its staff. The provincial CWD was then \ncombined  with  the  public  health  engineering  department  to  form  the  Works  and  Services \nDepartment. To look after the maintenance and development of the core provincial highway \nnetwork of about 2,100 km, the Frontier Highway Authority (FHA) was established in 2001. \n \n12.  Resources  for  Road  Development  and  Maintenance.  The  allocations  for  road \ndevelopment  in  NWFP  during  FY2001/02  to  FY2003/04  had  a  declining  trend  and  varied \nbetween 14% and 8% of the total annual development program. The expenditures on road \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2003.

", "30   Appendix 2 \nmaintenance declined significantly from a maximum of PRs296 million in FY1995/96 to PRs32 \nmillion in FY1999/2000, against an estimated need of PRs500 million to maintain the network.  \n \n13.  FHA receives an average of PRs730 million annually for development of the 2,100 km10 \nnetwork of provincial highways it manages. This is supplemented by about PRs130 million for \nmaintenance  that  FHA  generates  mainly  from  tolls.11  These  resources  are  adequate  for \nmaintaining and gradually improving the network. The resources for the 24 districts with a \nnetwork of about 7,000 km were curtailed from PRs123 million to PRs30 million in 2002\u20132003. \nA significant proportion of the network is in poor condition primarily due to a shortage of road \nmaintenance funds,12 but also due to lack of adequate capacity of the district road agencies. \nBased on road condition information provided by FHA and district governments, the backlog of \nmaintenance needs is approximately PRs2.5 billion; about PRs138 million is needed annually to \nsustain  the  network.13  Discussions  with  NPG  indicate  that  they  are  willing  to  provide  the \nrequired resources if the districts develop the capacity to utilize the funds properly. Hence, the \ndistricts\u2019  capacity  needs  to  be  developed  to  ensure  better  governance  and  enhanced \nsustainability of the road network. \n \n14.  Institutional  Capacity  and  Constraints.  The  new  district  governments  are  in  a \nformative stage and lack capacity as well as resources to manage the devolved road network. \nThough some staff from the former CWD were assigned to the district governments, their work \nis  adversely  affected  by  the  lack  of  institutional  mechanisms  and  operational  procedures. \nAdditionally, despite completion of physical devolution of the road assets, fiscal devolution is still \nin  a  transition  stage.  As  a  result,  the  district  governments  rely  on  federal  or  provincial \ngovernments for financial resources. The current transfer of resources is based on a strict \nstructured formula that requires the majority of funds to be used in the social sectors, leaving \nvery few resources for infrastructure. Thus, a significant proportion of the district road network is \nin poor condition due to shortage of road maintenance funds and lack of capacity in the district \ngovernments. \n \n15.  Road Safety. Improving road safety is an important issue in NWFP. The situation is \nexacerbated  because  of  weak  institutional  capacity,  lack  of  coordination  among  various \nagencies, and poor condition of roads. The Project will address policy issues by implementing \nthe provincial policy matrix and action plan designed to bring policy and institutional reforms to \nstrengthen road safety efforts. The action plan will set an overall strategy for improving road \nsafety in the province consistent with ongoing initiatives for the national highways. \n \n16.  Private Sector Participation. Opportunities for private sector participation in NWFP \nroad  infrastructure  projects  exist  as  the  level  of  traffic  on  some  corridors  is  high.  Private \ninvestors have approached provincial authorities about investing in road development, but lack \nof policies and of an enabling environment are major impediments. As part of policy reform and \nthe institutional strengthening component, assistance will be provided to overcome barriers to \nprivate sector participation in road development in the province.

The FHA network has therefore been reduced to 1,620 km. \n11  Other major revenue sources include earnings from equipment rental, material testing, right-of-way rental charges, \nfees from roadside gas stations, and contractor\u2019s registration.  \n12  The Nowshera district government said that based on an outdated yardstick (last revised in 1981), they need \nPRs17.6 million for maintenance of district roads. However, only PRs5 million was provided in FY2002/03 and in \nFY2003/04 this was drastically reduced to only PRs0.75 million.  \n13 An independent assessment was carried out under the project preparatory technical assistance based on a \ndetailed condition/roughness survey of roads in Nowshera district.

Introduction \n \n1.   The  selection  of  subprojects  for  rural  access  roads  by  North-West  Frontier  Province \nProvincial Government (NPG) will be subject to Asian Development Bank (ADB) approval. The \nselection criteria for subprojects and the approval process are outlined here. \n \nB.  Subproject Selection Criteria \n \n2.  Poverty  Targeting.  The  subproject  will  have  been  prioritized  based  on  the  district \ndevelopment  ranking  used  by  the  Government  to  determine  allocation  of  its  development \nexpenditures. Preference will be given to roads that improve access of poor communities to schools, \nhealth facilities, and markets. \n \n3.  Technical  Feasibility.  The  subproject  will  be  technically  feasible  and  a  detailed  report \nprepared. \n \n4.  Economic Feasibility. Economic analysis of the subproject will be prepared in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Project and the estimated economic internal rate \nof return will be at least 12%. \n \n5.  Social Assessment and Analysis. The subproject will be socially sound, minimize the need \nfor  land  acquisition,  and  include  measures  to  mitigate  social  impacts,  if  any.  An  initial  social \nassessment for the subproject will have been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s relevant guidelines.  \n \n6.  Resettlement. The proposed subproject road should not involve involuntary resettlement or \nland acquisition, and should have minimal impact on any people affected by the land acquisition, or \ntheir  livelihood.  If  a  subproject  involves  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement,  a  full \nresettlement plan (if the number of people affected is 200 or more) or short resettlement plan (if \nfewer than 200 people are affected), acceptable to ADB will have been prepared in accordance with \nthe resettlement framework agreed to by the Government and ADB and in accordance ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on Involuntary Resettlement. \n \n7.  Indigenous People. If any indigenous people, such as tribes or settlers, as per ADB\u2019s \ndefinition, are likely to be affected significantly by a subproject, an indigenous people\u2019s plan should \nbe prepared in accordance with ADB's Policy on Indigenous People. \n \n8.  Environmental Considerations. Each proposed subproject road will have been screened for \nits environmental impacts in compliance with the requirements of the Government and ADB,1 and will \nnot cause any major adverse impact on the environment. ADB will have received and reviewed the \ninitial environmental examination, if any, prepared for a proposed road. All necessary approvals and \nclearances will have been obtained for the subproject from the federal and provincial governments \nand related agencies. \n \n9.  Counterpart Funding. NPG will ensure that sufficient counterpart funding will be allocated to \nimplement  the  subproject  timely  and  efficiently  in  accordance  with  the  overall  implementation \nschedule. \n \n10.  Government Approvals. For each subproject, all necessary NPG approvals will have been \nobtained.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2003.

As appropriate, the relevant NPG district will have confirmed, in a \nmanner acceptable to ADB, its commitment to the proposed subproject road, including the provision \nof budgetary allocations for road rehabilitation and operation and maintenance.  \n \nC.  Approval Process for Subprojects  \n \n12.  All subprojects will be required to comply with ADB\u2019s policies and guidelines, and satisfy \nADB\u2019s procedures for subproject preparation with respect to technical, operational, economic, social, \nindigenous people, resettlement, and other requirements. NPG will ensure that sufficient counterpart \nfunding will be available. These requirements were applied for the six core subproject provincial \nroads during project preparation. They were found to be technically feasible, economically viable, \nsocially responsible, and environmentally sound. For additional subprojects, the requirements will be \nmet during project implementation. \n \n13.   During  the  early  stages  of  project  implementation,  the  Project  Management  Unit,  with \nassistance of the institutional and management consultants, will prepare a consolidated report for \none or more subprojects covering all the stipulated ADB requirements, which will be sent to ADB for \nreview and approval. Upon ADB\u2019s approval, the unit will proceed with further subproject preparation, \nprocurement, and subproject implementation.  \n \n ", "38   Appendix 6 \nIMPLEMENTATION OF RURAL ACCESS ROADS \n  \nA.  Allocation of Roads to Districts \n \n1.  The proposed criteria for allocation of roads to the districts is based on (i) connectivity \nrepresented by road density,1 (ii) population representing needs and economic activity, and (iii) \npoverty based on district ranking.2  \n \nB.  Selection \n \n2.  The Works and Services Department (WSD) will seek a list of priority roads from each \ndistrict. The roads will preferably be selected from the 2,745 kilometers (km) of roads initially \nproposed by the districts. The length of the roads proposed by each district will be at least twice \ntheir allocation. \n \n3.  The  WSD  will  forward  the  proposed  list  to  the  existing  chief  minister\u2019s  selection \ncommittee (CMSC)3 for selection of roads, according to their allocation, for inclusion under the \nProject. \n \nC.  Eligibility Criteria for Roads  \n \n4.  The eligibility of each selected road will be assessed based on the criteria that include \ntechnical and economic feasibility, social assessment, resettlement requirements, consideration \nfor  indigenous  people,  environmental  aspects,  stakeholder  consultation,  and  availability  of \ncounterpart resources. \n \n5.  The project consultants under the WSD will prepare subproject proposals for each of the \nselected roads. The proposal will include all assessments required to meet the eligibility criteria.  \n \nD.  Endorsement for Project Financing \n \n6.  The WSD presents the subproject proposals to the project steering committee (PSC)4 for \nits review and to ensure that the selected roads meet the eligibility criteria. The PSC will then \nendorse the roads for project financing. \n \nE.  Involvement of Districts in the CMSC and PSC \n \n7.  To  ensure  direct  involvement  of  districts,  3\u20135  district  coordination  officers  will  be \nmembers of the CMSC and PSC. \n \n                                                \n1  During implementation the road density will be firmed up based on detailed information provided by the districts on \ntheir network and verification by WSD. \n2  North-West Frontier Province. 2001. Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey 2001. Peshawar. \n3  The selection committee is headed by the chief minister, and comprises the senior minister and secretary of WSD, \nproject director, and five members of the Provincial Assembly representing different regions of the province. \n4  Chaired by the additional chief secretary Planning and Development Department, the PSC will comprise of \nsecretary, WSD; managing director, Frontier Highway Authority (FHA); representatives of the departments of \nfinance, planning and development, and local government; and the NHA, WSD, FHA project directors. The FHA \nproject director will serve as the PSC secretary. The PSC will meet at least quarterly. \n ", "    Appendix 6  39\nF.  Eligibility Criteria for Districts \n \n8.  To be eligible for proposing roads to be financed from the Project, the districts will need \nto demonstrate that they have an ongoing road maintenance program and that they have \ncapable staff. The following indicators5 will be used to assess district\u2019s eligibility: \n \n(i)  allocation of adequate resources for road maintenance in the previous year, \n(ii)  expenditure of at least 75% of the funds received, \n(iii)  utilization of the capacity-building opportunities under the Project and by others, \nand  \n(iv)  meet at least the minimum requirement for staff for road network.  \n \nG.  Implementation \n \n9.  The  WSD  will  engage  consultants  for  design,  preparation  of  bidding  documents, \nprocurement support, and construction supervision. \n \n10.  Bidding documents for the selected roads will be given to the districts for advertising. \n \n11.  Bids will be evaluated by a committee comprising the project director, the executive \ndistrict officer (Works and Services), and the consultant. \n \n12.  Civil work contracts will be awarded by the districts. The consultants will supervise \nconstruction.  The  districts\u2019  technical  staff  will  be  involved  in  monitoring  quality  of  road \nimprovement works and final inspection of the completed works before issuance of the contract \ncompletion certificate.  \n \nH.  Flow of Loan Funds \n \n15.  ADB shall advance funds to the Imprest Account established by WSD in accordance \nwith procedures established by the Borrower and accepted by ADB. In the case of districts \ndetermined to have sufficient capacity, the eligible amount of the proceeds of the Loan shall be \nmade available to the districts as specific purpose grants for road network improvement and \nconnectivity, and shall be disbursed as follows: \n \n(i)  based on quarterly estimates, funds shall be advanced by WSD to the second \ngeneration imprest accounts established at the district level, \n(ii)  payment to the relevant contractors shall be made by the DGs based on invoices \napproved by the consultant designated by the WSD, and \n(iii)  DGs shall report expenditures to the WSD on a monthly basis. \n \n16.  In the case of all of these districts, WSD shall directly disburse funds against invoices \nfrom contractors upon written authorization of payment by the responsible district engineer and \nthe consultant. \n \n                                                \n5  These indicators will be developed during project implementation. \n ", "40   Appendix 7 \nNORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE ROAD SAFETY ACTION PLAN  \n \nSpecific Activities for \nCurrent Situation \nActions Recommended   Implementation \nIssue  and Action \n  Agencies \nTaken   Activities  \nConcerned  \nA.

The  North-West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP)  Road  Development  Sector  and  Subregional \nConnectivity Project will involve the improvement of some 1,200 kilometers (km) of selected national, \nprovincial, and rural access roads. The economic analysis examined the expected contribution of the \nProject to NWFP and the subregion. A project approach is being taken for national and provincial \nhighways and a sector approach is being adopted for the rural access roads. Four national highway \nsections and five provincial highways were selected along with five core rural access roads, to act as \na sample of rural access roads to be implemented under the Project. These roads were selected by \nthe  NWFP  provincial  government  (NPG)  with  assistance  from  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance consultants. A similar analysis will be undertaken by the Executing Agency for noncore \nroads to be selected for inclusion in later stages of the Project. NPG has prepared a candidate list of \nroads from which roads will be selected  \n \nA.  Methodology and Key Assumptions \n2.  The methodology used follows Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The highway development and management model, HDM-4, has been \nused for the analysis. The analysis includes only direct savings in vehicle operating costs (VOC) and \ntravel time savings. Value added from better transport links resulting in new industries was not \nquantified. \n \n3.  The analysis considered with- and without-project scenarios. For most roads, the with-project \noption follows the existing alignment and only treatment alternatives (triple surface treatment or \nasphaltic concrete) were considered. In the case of Peshawar-Torkham several alignment options, \ndifferent phasing of construction, and use of rail were considered. The with-project options described \nin this appendix are the most cost-effective options in each case. \n \nB.  Road Condition and Traffic \n4.  The condition of existing paved roads, in terms of the international roughness index, ranges \nfrom 6.9 to 11.5 for national highways and from 5.7 to 13.6 for provincial highways. Immediately after \nreconstruction, the international roughness index is assumed to be 2.5 for national and provincial \nhighways and 4.0 for rural roads. \n \n5.  Traffic surveys were carried out on the core roads (Table A12.5). In the absence of historical \ntraffic count data for most roads, traffic growth rates were estimated based on national averages. The \ngrowth rates shown in Table A12.1 were tested with the exceptions of the Peshawar-Torkham and \nBannu-Ghulan Khan roads. The optimistic estimate was 10% for passenger and 12% for freight as \nthese roads are expected to see rapid increases in cross-border traffic. By comparison, growth for the \nN-55 (the only NWFP road for which reports were available) is reported to be 7.5% per year, with \nsome sections as high as 20%. \n \nTable A12.1: Traffic Growth Rates \nCategory  Conservative   Optimistic \n  (%)  (%) \nCare, Jeep, Taxi  5.0  6.0 \nMotorcycle  7.5  7.5 \nWagon/Pickup  4.0  6.0 \nBus  4.0  6.0 \nTruck   5.0  7.0 \nMulti-Axle   5.0  7.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n6.  Additional traffic is expected because of the VOC reductions with the road improvements. In \nthe case of national and provincial highways, the improvements are primarily upgrading existing ", "50   Appendix 12 \nroads, so additional traffic will be relatively small\u2014a 5% increase is assumed for 2007. For rural \naccess roads, the improvement is more significant, changing the nature of the road in most cases\u2014a \n10% traffic increase is assumed for 2006. The exceptions are the Peshawar-Torkham road, where the \nimprovement will have a significant impact\u2014in this case a 25% increase is assumed for 2007; and \nBannu-Miram  Shah-Ghulam  Khan  where  although  some  international  traffic  is  using  the  route, \ndevelopment will open new opportunities\u2014a 200% increase in freight traffic was assumed, bringing it \nup to about 25% of the Torkham traffic level. While the cumulative effect of these assumptions on the \ntraffic forecast is large in percentage terms, both roads are starting from a low base. \n \nC.  Costs \n7.  VOC depends upon road conditions, and vehicle characteristics, utilization, and prices. For \nvehicle characteristics, default values of the highway development and management model have \nbeen used. Vehicle prices and utilization were estimated based on discussions with the motor \nindustry. The tax component of vehicle and parts prices and fuel was deducted to give a border price \nequivalent value. \n \n8.  Road improvement costs were established for each road separately on the basis of estimated \nquantities of work using rates for each district from the composite schedule of rates (2000) of the \nNational Highway Authority. For the national highway sections, previous cost estimates were updated \nusing the same quantities, but using current national highway unit rates. The rates were converted to \nborder price equivalent values assuming that the net effect of taxes and controls, monopoly rents on \ndomestic costs, etc., is 15%. This is the value used in previous studies. The eventual source of \nmaterials and equipment is not known, making any better estimate difficult. \n \n9.  Maintenance costs are based on the unit rates for various maintenance operations. The unit \nrate schedules are financial costs inclusive of taxes and duties that are transfer payments. Previous \nstudies have assumed a difference between financial and economic costs of 15%, which allows for \ntax, monopoly rent, and a shadow price of labor below the nominal wage rate. The project duration is \nassumed to be 1 year for short roads (less than 50 km), and 2 years for long road sections with 50% \nof the works to be carried out in year 1 and 50% in year 2. \n \nD.  Benefits \n10.  The main quantifiable benefits of the investment are (i) VOC savings for normal traffic; and (ii) \nVOC savings for additional traffic. The savings in VOC are generated primarily though better road \nsurface conditions. Improvements in alignment and gradient also play a part particularly for the \nPeshawar-Torkham road. As the access to markets improves, economic activities are expected to \nincrease, resulting in generated traffic. The benefit to generated traffic is based on an estimate of \nwillingness to pay imputed from the difference in the financial cost with and without the Project. New \nusers were not willing to pay the without-project cost but are willing to pay the with-project cost. The \nwillingness to pay of new users is assumed to form a linear distribution between these extremes. \nAnother benefit is the savings in periodic maintenance costs for NPG. \n \nE.  Results of the Economic Evaluation and Sensitivity Analysis \n \n1.  Economic Evaluation \n \n11.  The economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) for the selected roads have been computed \nusing the highway development and management model-4. The EIRRs range from 17% to 33% for \nnational highways, 18% to 29% for provincial highways, and 16% to 30% for rural roads\u2014all above \n12%. The EIRRs are shown in the first column of Table A12.2. \n \n12.  The sensitivity of the EIRRs to changes in key assumptions has been tested (Table A12.2). \nThe analysis shows that the roads with the lowest EIRR are the most sensitive to changes in the key ", "  Appendix 12  51\nassumptions. Since the current traffic mix is known, sensitivity to changes in the mix was not tested. \nChanging the differential growth rate had only a minor impact. \n \nTable A12.2: Sensitivity Analysis \nRoad Section  Base Case EIRR 20% VOC  50%  20%  20% Increase  Reduction One-Year \n  Reduction   Reduction  Increase in in Capital  in Growth  Delay in \nin Value of  Capital  Cost and  to 5%  Construct\nTime  Cost  20% VOC  ion \nReduction  \nNational Highways                \nMalana Junction- 30.0  25.7  28.2  26.4  22.4  25.5  28.1 \nSarai Gambila  \nBadabher-Darra  33.2  27.9  30.8  28.7  24.1  29.0  31.9 \nAdam Khel,  \nPeshawar-Torkhum   21.6  19.8  21.4  20.2  15.6  17.1  21.2 \nSarai Gambila- 17.5  15.8  16.4  15.4  12.5  15.9  16.8 \nGhulam Khan  \n               \nProvincial Highways                \nCharsadda-Mardan  18.6  15.4  17.2  15.9  12.9  15.9  16.5 \n(2x7.3) \nJehangira-Swabi  28.9  24.4  27.2  24.9  20.9  25.0  27.1 \nOption-I \nRemaining Portion  22.3  18.8  21.2  19.4  16.2  19.4  21.2 \nof Khushal Garh-\nKohat  \nKohat-Thall   24.5  20.7  22.4  21.2  18.1  21.4  22.7 \n \nTamirgarh-Munda   17.8  14.8  16.1  15.3  12.5  13.8  16.1 \n \nRural Roads                \nUmerzai-Harichand  16.0  13.1  14.9  13.4  12.8  14.1  14.9 \nDargai  \nKarak-Sabirabad  18.3  15.3  16.8  15.6  13.4  18.3  16.4 \nSarqala-Martung  17.5  14.3  16.1  14.6  11.7  17.5  15.8 \n \nPatriak-Kalkot-Thall- 25.4  21.2  23.9  21.7  18.0  22.3  23.2 \nBadgoi \nLahor-Baika-Jabbal- 30.4  26.2  28.4  25.9  22.3  27.4  28.2 \nJehangira \nEIRR \u2013 economic internal rates of return; VOC \u2013 vehicle operating costs. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n13.  From Table A12.2 shows that the results are most sensitive to the assumed VOC (and thus \nthe savings calculated from changes in these) and the capital costs. A reduction in VOC of 28% is \nrequired before one of the core roads ceases to be viable. An increase in capital costs of 30% is \nrequired before one of the core roads ceases to be viable. Column five shows a combination of these \ntwo worst-case scenarios producing both a reduction in benefits and an increase in capital costs. \n \n14.  A qualitative risk analysis was undertaken. Because the Project involves essentially marginal \nimprovements  to  existing  roads  using  standard  construction  techniques,  the  probability  of  the \nswitching values being exceeded was considered low. The component most liable to variation is the \ncapital cost. This risk has been reduced by taking a conservative approach to estimation of unit rates. \nThe input data with greatest uncertainty are the traffic growth rates. However most roads are viable \nwith no growth at all or even a decline in traffic. The exception is the Sarai Gambila-Ghulam Khan \nroad. However once this is upgraded, it provides a much shorter route to the ports for the Kabul area \nof Afghanistan. As indicated in Table A12.3, reduction in the assumed growth rate to 3.5% is required \nbefore EIRRs for any of the rural or provincial roads drop below 12%.

Distribution Analysis \n15.  The distribution analysis has been undertaken following ADB\u2019s Handbook for Integrating \nPoverty Impact in Economic Analysis of Projects. All economic net benefits are distributed among the \nfollowing categories of stakeholders: (i) local passenger users, (ii) through travellers, (iii) freight users, \n(iv) vehicle owners, (v) skilled and unskilled labor, (vi) government/economy.  \n \n16.  The  distribution  analysis  was  undertaken  separately  for  each  road  and  summarized  for \nnational, provincial, and rural access roads. The total net benefits are about PRs14 billion (or $240 \nmillion) in present value discounted at 12%. This does not include any estimate of the likely impact of \nthrough traffic between Afghanistan and the Central Asian republics and the Pakistan ports, which is \nlikely to lead to further direct and indirect benefits. The size of these benefits depends on how the \nregional and national economies grow over the Project\u2019s time horizon and the competitiveness of \nPakistan\u2019s ports and other infrastructure. Increasing the proportion of benefits going to through traffic \nwill reduce the poverty impact ratio of the Project as a whole, particularly as the resulting additional \nmaintenance cost falls on the province. \nF.  Poverty Impact \n17.  To  undertake  the  poverty  impact  analysis,  a  household  survey  of  550  households  was \nundertaken in the villages alongside the candidate roads; it included a question on trip making. For \nthrough travellers, an additional roadside survey was undertaken. Although the data were captured by \nroad, they were aggregated to provide an overall figure of 40% of poor nonlocal travellers. The survey \ndata were used to estimate the proportion of trips on each road that were local and through. \nGovernment vehicles are assumed to receive 5% of the vehicle-owner benefits. \n \n18.  The calculated poverty impact ratio varies widely between roads and is very sensitive to the \nEIRR of the individual roads. The poverty impact ratio values range from 37% to over 100% for ", "  Appendix 12  53\nnational highways (overall 46%); from 36% to 60% for provincial highways (overall 46%), and 42% to \n80% for rural roads (overall 49%).  \n \n19.  Table A12.4 summarizes the analysis of the individual roads. The top section of the table \nshows how the consumer surplus (the difference between the economic and financial benefit) is \ndistributed among stakeholders. A total of PRs20.9 billion savings to existing traffic and PRs2.0 billion \nbenefits to new traffic are distributed across local users, through traffic, freight users, vehicle owners, \nlabor, and the economy. Most benefits are assumed to accrue to vehicle owners. Benefits to end \nusers are passed on in the form of lower fares or improved services. The extent this occurs depends \non the degree of competition\u2014assumed to be higher on national highways. The Government is \nestimated to own about 5% of the vehicles. Skilled labor loses some benefits from existing traffic \nbecause vehicle maintenance is reduced, but gains from new users. Labor gains some of the PRs1.7 \nbillion producer surplus from construction and maintenance.  \n \n20.  The lower section of the table shows the proportion of the benefits that accrue to the poor. The \nproportion of stakeholders that are poor was estimated from household and roadside interviews, and \nvaries between roads. All unskilled laborers are assumed to be poor. The proportion of poor in the \neconomy at large was estimated from the poor\u2019s contribution to gross domestic product. The poverty \nimpact ratio is the ratio of the benefit to the poor to the overall net benefit. Overall, the poverty impact \nratio is 49%. \n \nTable A12.4 Distribution and Poverty Impact Analysis\u2014Summary \n \nOverall  Net Benefits (PRs million)  Distribution Of Net Benefits (PRs million) \n    National  Government  Road Users  Labor   \n    Economic  Financial   Local  Through   Freight  Vehicle      Govt/ \nItem  PV  PV  Difference  Users  Traffic    Owners  Un- Skill Eco-\nskilled  -ed  nomy \nInflows                     \n   Savings  20,883  0  20,883  3,839  2,719  5,457  8,820  0  (416)  464 \n  New Trips  2,039  0  2,039  323  148  703  785  0  39  41 \nOutflows                     \n  Initial Capital   (9,731)  (11,434)  1,703  0  0  0  0  175  78  1,450 \n  Maintenance  (277)  (331)  54  0  0  0  0  23  7  24 \nNet Benefits  12,914  (11,765)  24,679  4,162  2,867  6,161  9,605  198  (293)  1,980 \nGains and Losses  12,914  4,162  2,867  6,161  9,605  198  (293)  (9,785) \nNet Benefits for the Poor    6,285  2,847  1,147  2,464  1,011  198  (59)  (1,323) \n      PIR  48.7%               ", "54   Appendix 12 \nTable A12.5: Traffic Data for Projects Roads (2004) \n \nTotal \nAnimal-   Motor-  Trucks   Trucks  Trucks \nRoad     Cars   Wagons  Buses  Motorized \nDrawn  cycles   2 Axles  3Axles >3 Axles \nTraffic \nNational Highways                    \nMalana Junction-Sarai \nGambila  \n18  38  861  1,211  424  1,063  803  164  4,563 \nBadabher-Darra Adam \nKhel   68  258  1,670  1,847  320  1,010  693  217  6,015 \nPeshawar-Torkhum   12  22  1,300  2,427  173  485  203  290  4,900 \nBannu-Miranshah \u2013 \nGhulam Khan  7  56  270  158  16  197  13  0  710 \n                   \nProvincial Highways \n                         \nCharsadda-Mardan  \n81  401  1,859  1,838  46  815  50  42  5,051 \nJehangira-Swabi   189  267  1,125  1,526  118  898  106  43  4,083 \nKohat-Khushal Garh  \n25  17  951  1,317  81  416  26  8  2,815 \nKohat-Thall   72  166  1,475  1,611  52  324  53  16  3,697 \nTamirgarh-Munda  \n105  174  636  863  50  280  68  0  2,071 \n \n                 \nRural Access Roads                 \nUmerzai-Harichand \nDargai   121  666  1,043  483  8  222  1  0  2,423 \nKarak-Sabirabad \nRoad up to \nShakardarra   40  106  257  561  5  80  2  0  1,011 \nSarqala-Martung  6  38  64  154  2  34  0  0  292 \nPatriak-Kalkot \u2013 \nThall-Badgoi  8  45  44  287  0  32  0  0  408 \nLahor-Baika-Jabbal-\nJehangira   15  38  54  158  2  45  1  0  298 \n                   \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \n \nIn general, road development provides direct benefits to road users and encourages economic \ndevelopment by allowing easier mobility and access to markets and suppliers. In Pakistan, the \ndegree to which the poor benefit depends on a number of factors. In general, roads can reduce \nisolation, a common cause of poverty in the country. They can reduce transport costs, and allow \neasier access to population welfare services, sources of employment, health care, education, \nand banking and credit facilities; and provide opportunities for income generation along the \nroadside. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Poverty Classification:  Poverty Intervention1 \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nNorth-West Frontier Province (NWFP) is by far the poorest of the provinces in Pakistan, with an \noverall incidence of poverty substantially higher than that for the country as a whole. Poverty \nheadcount for NWFP is 44%, compared with 33% for Pakistan. Both urban and rural poverty in \nNWFP are higher than that for the entire country: poverty headcounts for urban and rural NWFP \nare about urban 31 % and rural 47%, while for Pakistan the rates are urban 24% and rural 36%. \nPoverty reduction has occurred only in urban areas of NWFP, although it remains the highest for \nall urban areas in the country.  \n \nIn addition, depth and severity of both urban and rural poverty2 are relatively higher for NWFP than \nfor the rest of the country. Inequality in NWFP, as measured by the Gini coefficient for equivalent \nadult consumption, is very similar to that for the country, in rural and urban areas alike. Poverty \nis associated with larger households, lack of asset ownership, and low education and literacy \nstatus. Land ownership in NWFP is more equal than for Pakistan, with relatively few large \nlandowners. The majority of landowners (36% of the rural population) in NWFP belong to the \ncategory of small and marginal farmers, namely those who own either no land or up to 1 hectare. \nThis makes NWFP relatively more equal and less hierarchical than areas with large landholdings \nand larger numbers of landless people. \nThe average daily income per capita is about PRs243 compared with PRs33 for Pakistan as a \nwhole. In 1988, the infant mortality rate (IMR) was 79 per 1,000 and the under-five mortality rate \n116 per 1000 live births. Over one third of children (38%) under age 5 years are underweight. \nOnly 39% of children of primary school age (5\u20139 years) in NWFF are enrolled in primary school \nwith higher enrolment rates recorded in urban settings. About two thirds (63%) of the population \nhas access to safe drinking water, 88% in urban and 59% in rural areas. The Pakistan Integrated \nHousehold Survey 1998/99 indicates that 42% of households in NWFP do not have toilets or \n                                                 \n1  Following the Board approval of the R-paper, Review of ADB\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy, staff instructions to    \nreplace the PI/CPI classification with a new tracking system are under preparation, in line with para. 83 of the R-\npaper. \n2  Measured by poverty gap and squared poverty gap respectively \n3  Government of Pakistan. 2003. Pakistan Integrated Household Survey 1998/99. Islamabad. \n ", "56   Appendix 13 \naccess to communal latrines, which is lower than the national average of 46%. Of households \nwith toilets, less than half (39%)4 have access to safe sanitation. Women on average spend 3.7 \nhours collecting water.  \n \nA household survey revealed a high level of poverty (51%) in communities adjacent to the road \ndevelopment project areas. This percentage was self-assessed and compares closely with the \nofficially recorded poverty levels in rural areas of NWFP. Household size of the population in the \nproject area (9.1) was considerably higher than the national average of 6.7 and the average for \nrural areas of NWFP (7.1). The ratio of employed persons to working age population is 37.2%. \nMost people earn their livelihoods from nonagricultural work (89%). The largest proportion of \nthose employed (39.2%) are unskilled laborers. This is followed by agriculture workers at 17.8%.  \nTransport-related work accounts for 10%. The rest of the population works for the government \n(including the army) and as small-scale trade people. Literacy levels are 37% in the project area. \nThe area has few medical facilities: only one village in the project area has a maternal and child \ncare center, and 40% of villagers have to travel more than 6 kilometers (km) to reach a basic \nhealth unit. Most villages have a mosque school in the village and a primary school either in the \nvillage or less than 1 km away. Girls\u2019 net enrolments are considerably less than boys. Villages in \nthe vicinity of the Project either have no basic road linking them to the main road or have dirt \nroads in poor condition that are mostly inaccessible for transport services. Paved lanes inside \nvillages are virtually nonexistent. \n \nProject beneficiaries will be primarily road users. These will include the poor who will benefit from \nreduced  fares  and  freight  charges.  The  Project  will  encourage  a  degree  of  economic \ndevelopment by allowing easier mobility and access to jobs, markets, suppliers, banking and \ncredit facilities, population welfare services, health care, and education; and may encourage \nincreased income generation along the roadside. However, the Project will not automatically \ntrigger significant lowering of barriers to the poor that will allow them to rise out of poverty. For \nexample, in the case of women, severe social and cultural restrictions on their mobility combined \nwith a low skill base mean that the benefits of improved roads are unlikely to make much impact \non women\u2019s poverty. To enhance the ability of the poor and the very poor, especially women, to \nbenefit from the development additional complementary mechanisms under the Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction (JFPR) project have been designed for lowering these barriers.  \n \nPoverty reduction will be monitored during implementation through changes in the fare costs and \ntravel-related charges that impact on the poor and the proportion of poor households involved in \nemployment activities in the implementation phase. A social and environmental cell will be \ndeveloped within the Executing Agency, which will, among other tasks, monitor social and \npoverty impacts and manage the JFPR.  \n \n \nC.
