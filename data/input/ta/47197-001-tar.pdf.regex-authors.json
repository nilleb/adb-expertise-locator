INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Regional cooperation and integration is one of three institutional objectives of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) corporate guidance in Strategy 2020, which recognizes the control of \ncommunicable diseases as a regional public good.1 The Operational Plan for Health and the \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Strategy also highlight ADB\u2019s role in supporting Asia and \nthe Pacific to expand opportunities for addressing health challenges at regional and subregional \nlevels.2 ADB\u2019s strategy towards E-development in Asia and the Pacific points out that ADB shall \nintegrate information and communication technology (ICT) applications in its activities in the \nhealth  sector  to  improve  service  provision  and  data  management.3 Moreover,  ADB  as  a \nknowledge bank, has a mandate to advance the capacity of regional centers of excellence and \nfoster the application of innovations in development. \n \n2.  The countries of Asia and the Pacific continue to face communicable disease challenges, \nincluding a continuing burden from malaria, and drug-resistant malaria in the Greater Mekong \nSubregion (GMS), particularly in border areas. At the same time, the region is experiencing \nincreasing incidence of dengue, which is linked to rapid, unplanned urbanization. Containing \ndrug-resistant malaria, preparing a malaria elimination agenda, and understanding the increase \nand spread of dengue requires active and real-time surveillance. The technical assistance (TA) \nwill  assess  how  surveillance  and  control  of  reemerging  communicable  diseases  can  be \nstrengthened by applying cost-effective modern technology (geographical information systems \n[GISs], mobile phones, and satellite remote sensing) to limit the spread of disease through \nhuman mobility.  \n \n3.  The participating developing member countries were involved in the TA preparation and \nthey welcome this initiative.4 ADB will not undertake this regional TA unless a no-objection \nconfirmation has been received.5  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Regional cooperation in the GMS and ADB investments have played an important role in \nfacilitating connectivity and economic links within the GMS, contributing to increased trade, \ncompetitiveness,  and  economic  growth.  However,  increased  connectivity  has  been \naccompanied by increased risks to regional health security (an important public good) and it has \nalso been recognized under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy and addressed \nin  the  Second  GMS  Regional  Communicable  Diseases  Control  Project.6 With  more  than \n                                            \n1  ADB. 2008.

Manila.  \n4  Fact-finding missions were conducted in August\u2013December 2013 and January and March 2014 in Cambodia, \nMyanmar, and Thailand. The TA was discussed at regional events such as the World Health Organization (WHO) \nbiregional healthy border meeting in August 2013, and the Second GMS Regional Communicable Diseases Control \nProject steering committee meeting in September 2013. \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 April 2014.  \n6  The TA aims to build on and support the Second GMS Regional Communicable Diseases Control Project through \npiloting  innovative  technology  for  disease  surveillance.  The  team  leader  of  the  Second  GMS  Regional \nCommunicable Diseases Control Project suggested linking of capacity building of this TA with activities under the \nSecond GMS Regional Communicable Diseases Control Project. \n ", "2    \n \n2 million mobile workers moving around the GMS, labor mobility threatens public health and the \nwell-being of the population in the GMS and beyond.7 The link between increased mobility of \npeople  within  and  across  national  borders  and  accelerated  transmission  of  vector-borne \ndiseases is well established.8 Moreover, increasing mobility of people from malaria hot spots, \nsuch as mountainous border areas, or from urban centers (often hot spots of dengue infections), \nadds to the risk of spreading contained infections.9  \n \n5.  Overall, malaria infections are decreasing in Cambodia, Myanmar, and Thailand but \nmalaria is still the main cause of death among migrants in Thailand, followed by mosquito-borne \ndiseases such as dengue fever, the incidence of which is increasing throughout the GMS.10 \nLooking at the economic  costs of these reemerging infectious diseases, both malaria and \ndengue pose a substantial economic and disease burden in the GMS. For example, dengue \ncases are 17 times more prevalent than hepatitis B or even upper respiratory diseases (footnote \n10). \n6.  Although  GMS  countries  have  made  great  strides  in  combating  malaria,  tracking \nprogress is still a major challenge since malaria surveillance systems detect only about one in \n10  cases. 11  The  recommended  first-line  antimalarial  drugs  such  as  artemisinin-based \ncombination  therapies  are  becoming  less  effective,  and  there  are  no  new  drugs  in  the \npharmaceutical pipeline to take their place.  \n7.  Malaria is mostly a rural problem, spreading radially to urban areas through peoples\u2019 \nmobility. Dengue, on the other hand, spreads from the larger cities (where it is often linked to \nunplanned  urbanization,  standing  water,  and  weak  sanitation  systems)  to  smaller \ncommunities.12 Variable  weather  conditions,  increases  in  temperature,  changing  monsoon \npatterns, and the circulation of counterfeit drugs have added to the problem of fighting these \nreemerging diseases.  \n8.  Increased monitoring and surveillance, and cross-border collaboration are required to \naddress  these  problems.  Early  identification  of  disease  hot  spots  (dengue,  malaria,  drug-\nresistant malaria) helps to contain the spread of these vector-borne diseases efficiently since it \nfacilitates tailoring disease control programs to high-risk sites. Earth observation and space \ntechnologies,  such  as  GISs,  mobile  phones,  and  satellite  remote  sensing,  can  provide \ninformation in real time and identify the source and destination (also called \u201csink\u201d) of these \nvector-borne diseases. This allows the mapping of the routes of parasite dispersal by human \ncarriers for additional targeted control by identifying both the regions where imported infections \n                                            \n7  World  Bank.  2006.

Targeting mobile populations in surveillance and control programs will require different \napproaches than used when controlling local transmission hot spots. Programs required are \nthose which communicate risks to mobile populations to alter their behaviors, restrict travel \npatterns, and conduct routine surveillance in high-risk areas.  Using mobile phone call data \nrecords  (CDRs)  to  analyze  how  human  movement  affects  the  spread  of  mosquito-borne \ndiseases was spearheaded in studies in Kenya, where mobile phone ownership ranges from \n14% in rural to 80% in urban areas.13 This study helped to inform policy decisions on how to \nrefocus control and prevention efforts, as well as identify highly mobile groups for targeting of \nsurveillance efforts.  \n10.  The TA will improve surveillance of malaria and dengue in mobile populations and, thus, \nwill assist in mitigating negative effects of increased mobility in Cambodia, Myanmar, and \nThailand  linked  to  improved  regional  cooperation  and  integration.  The  TA  will  strengthen \nregional networks of centers of excellence; build capacity of local epidemiologists, national \nmalaria programs, and GIS experts; and facilitate partnerships with the private sector.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA will be improved malaria and dengue surveillance, and control \nprograms for mobile populations in Cambodia, Myanmar, and Thailand. The outcome of the TA \nwill be improved understanding of the impact of human mobility on malaria prevalence and \ndengue incidence in Cambodia, Myanmar, and Thailand. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The  TA  will  analyze  the  potential  for  national  malaria  programs  to  use  valuable, \ncomplementary,  and  contemporary  datasets  from  CDR  and  GIS  technology  to  strengthen \nmalaria and dengue prevention, surveillance, and control in mobile population groups and to \nguide disease control and elimination strategies. \n \n13.  The TA will support analysis of CDRs to track people\u2019s movement patterns anonymously, \nlinking them with dengue and malaria prevalence data in Cambodia, Myanmar, and Thailand. \nThis will be an additional surveillance tool to  (i) improve targeting of control programs by \nidentifying sources and sinks of the diseases, (ii) target highly mobile populations and disease \nhot spots, and (iii) map the routes of parasite (malaria) and virus (dengue) infection. The TA will \nevaluate the usefulness of this methodology to improve surveillance and control programs, and \nbuild capacity for real-time surveillance.  \n14.

Telecommunications  in  Thailand. \n \n ", "4    \n \nMyanmar, the mobile penetration rate was still less than 5%. However, Myanmar\u2019s Ministry of \nCommunications, Posts and Telegraphs has begun to extend mobile phone coverage with a \nview to achieving penetration of 45% by 2016.15 Mobile-phone-based technology covers a broad \nnetwork that includes poorer segments of the population who can access cheaper prepaid \nsubscriptions. \n15.  Output 1: GIS-based visualization system of human mobility, malaria prevalence, \nand  dengue  incidence  established,  and  methodology  evaluated. Private mobile phone \nproviders will provide anonymous CDRs for a 6\u201312 month period. The data will be stored on a \nserver in one of the participating countries and will be analyzed by experts. Human mobility will \nthen be linked with malaria and dengue incidence data. Findings of the analysis and visual \nmodels will be presented at the midterm review workshop. \n \n16.  Output 2: Prevalence and incidence data of malaria and dengue analyzed. Twelve \nmonths of retrospective incidence data will be used to develop a malaria and dengue risk map. \nThe map  will  be  supplemented  by  real-time  surveillance  data  collected  by  short message \nservice (SMS) and mobile phones. The epidemiological data will be used to model parasite \ndispersion linked to human mobility. The output will also support a feasibility study prepared in \ncollaboration with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) for the methodology of (i) \ngeospatial analysis using satellite remote sensing data and GISs to identify influential factors of \nendemic malaria, and (ii) near real-time monitoring of major factors of endemic malaria using \nremote sensing in the pilot area in the participating countries. This could provide conclusions on \npossible changing vector behavior with increasing deforestation in the case of malaria, and with \nincreased urbanization and changing water storage in rural areas in the case of dengue. \n \n17.  Output 3: Policy recommendations for targeting mobile populations in malaria and \ndengue surveillance and control programs communicated to ministries of health. The key \nfindings of the analysis of the CDRs and malaria and dengue incidence maps will be presented \nto government counterparts, and regular application of the analysis and maps for strengthening \nmalaria and dengue control program will be assessed. The added value of applying modern \ntechnology to improve case detection for malaria elimination programs will be analyzed. The TA \nwill support a regional workshop where study findings will be presented to GMS counterparts, \ndevelopment partners, civil society organizations, the private sector, and research centers.  \n \n18.  Output 4: Capacity of government public health experts for application of GIS-\nbased  visualization  developed.  The  TA  will  support  the  development  of  national  and \nsubregional capacity to use GIS-based visualization technology on a routine basis and for \nresearch projects. This includes CDR data being stored and maintained on a local server to \nallow sustainable application of the methodology. \n \n19.  A major assumption is that local telecommunication companies cooperate in providing \nCDRs, and a major risk is that not all malaria and dengue cases are correctly reported and \nregistered in national surveillance systems.16 \n                                            \nhttp://www.itu.int/ITU-D/asp/CMS/Events/2011/ITUADB/FinalWorkshop/Thailand-S2.pdf (accessed 30 June 2013); \nInternational Telecommunication Union (accessed 30 June 2013). \n15 International  Telecommunication  Union.  2012.

The TA will ensure that malaria and dengue incidence data is used from reliable \nsources recognized by national malaria programs. \n ", "5 \n \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,017,000 equivalent, of which (i) $417,000 will be financed \non  a grant  basis  by the  Republic  of Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund,  and \n(ii) $600,000  will  be  financed  by  the  Regional  Malaria  and  Other  Communicable  Disease \nThreats  Trust  Fund 17  under  the  Health  Financing  Partnership  Facility.  Both  funds  are \nadministered by ADB. The governments of Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of in-kind contributions.18  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  ADB, through the Regional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD), will be \nthe executing agency and RSDD will lead the overall implementation in collaboration with the \nSoutheast Asia Department. All disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n22.  The TA will establish an advisory group with representatives from the involved partners \nand centers of excellence to advise on the TA implementation. ADB will enter nondisclosure \nagreement private with phone providers.19  \n  \n23.  The expected outputs, outcome evaluation, and lessons will be disseminated through \nthe websites of ADB and other partners, including the WHO and centers of excellence such as \nthe  University  of Tokyo  and the  Harvard  School  of  Public  Health. The TA  will  strengthen \nregional ICT for development innovation networks. It also envisages publishing the findings in \npeer-reviewed public health journals. \n \n24.  The TA will be implemented from June 2014 to June 2016. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $417,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, and (ii) ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Regional Malaria and Other Communicable Disease Threats Trust Fund \nunder the Health Financing Partnership Facility for Malaria and Dengue Risk Mapping and \nResponse Planning in the Greater Mekong Subregion, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n                                            \n17  Financing partners are the governments of Australia and the United Kingdom. \n18  TA fact-finding was undertaken in August 2013 in Thailand and in January 2014 in Cambodia, and follow-up \ndiscussions with Thailand last March 2014. \n19  Discussed during TA fact-finding with private phone providers.

The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  coordinate  and  support  the  technical \nassistance (TA) activities to improve disease surveillance in the Greater Mekong Subregion \n(GMS). With the improvements in surveillance systems linked to improved diagnosis of malaria, \ndetailed satellite imagery being readily available, and mobile phone usage data continually \nbeing collected by network providers, the potential exists to make operational use of such \nvaluable, complimentary, and contemporary datasets on an ongoing basis in infectious diseases \ncontrol and elimination. The TA will be implemented in two phases, with the first phase starting \nin Cambodia with a focus on malaria, and the second phase roll out in Myanmar and Thailand \nincluding modeling for dengue as appropriate. \n \n2.  The TA will bring together local and international research institutes such as the Harvard \nSchool of Public Health and the University of Tokyo. Harvard has pioneered this approach to \nunderstand the impact of human mobility on infectious disease transmission, specifically related \nto malaria, publishing the first large-scale study of this kind.1 Furthermore, the institutes bring \ntogether a world-renowned group of malaria and vector-borne disease researchers and public \nhealth practitioners, with the interdisciplinary capabilities to provide expert technical support in \nthe fields of infectious disease epidemiology, biostatistics, and mathematical modeling. The \nUniversity of Tokyo has leading expertise in geographic information system (GIS) technology \nand utilizing call data records (CDRs) to model human mobility. It has also established a good \nnetwork of partners in the region, including the Asian Institute of Technology. 2 The project will \nalso collaborate with civil society stakeholders and other research institutes such as the Institut \nPasteur. All project activities will be closely coordinated with the World Health Organization \n(WHO) Emergency Response to Artemisinin Resistance Hub in Phnom Penh and with national \nmalaria programs. \n \n3.  An advisory steering committee with members from centers of excellence, research \ninstitutes,  the  private  sector,  civil  society  organizations  and  development  partners  will  be \nestablished to provide guidance and advice, and to ensure coordination of project activities. The \ncommittee  will  explore  opportunities  to  establish  a  sustainable  mechanism  to  support \noperational information and communication technology (ICT) and public health research in the \nregion beyond this project. The committee will meet once a year and teleconferences will be \nheld as needed to allow a close working relationship. Travel expenses and per diem for the \nparticipating representatives will be covered under the TA. \n \n4.  Individual  consultants  and  a  firm  will  be  recruited  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).
