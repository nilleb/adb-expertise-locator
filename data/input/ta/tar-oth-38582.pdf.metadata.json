INTRODUCTION \n1.  Developing a regional transport agreement is vital to eliminating nonphysical barriers to \ntrade  and  to  complementing  physical  transport  infrastructure  investments  to  facilitate  the \nefficient  movement  of  vehicles,  goods,  and  people.  The  Governments  of  the  Shanghai \nCooperation  Organization  (SCO)1  member  countries\u23afKazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan\u23afhave \ntherefore agreed to develop a multilateral agreement on facilitating international road transport. \nBased on the experience of the Greater Mekong subregional cooperation and with assistance of \nthe United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), the \nSCO members held an expert group meeting in Urumqi, PRC on 1\u22123 June 2004 to prepare the \ndraft Intergovernmental Framework Agreement on Facilitation of International Road Transport. \nThe first negotiating meeting on the draft framework agreement was held in Urumqi on 3\u22127 \nAugust 2004. The prime ministers of the SCO member countries are committed to completing \nnegotiations on the framework agreement within the first half of 2005.2 \n \n2.  Because  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  the  region\u2019s  premier  development \nfinance institution and has rich experience in regional cooperation, UNESCAP wrote to the SCO \nmembers in November 2004 seeking their endorsement of ADB support, as recommended at \nthe August Urumqi meeting. The SCO member governments agreed, and UNESCAP invited \nADB to join. Because ADB\u2019s Charter mandates fostering of regional cooperation, the regional \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)3  is  included  in  the  regional  TA  program  for  2004.  Management \napproved the concept paper on 18 November 2004. A fact-finding mission visited UNESCAP \nfrom 2\u22124 December 2004 and reached agreements with UNESCAP staff on the objectives, \nscope, cost estimates, financing plan, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for \nconsultants for the TA. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The  six  SCO  members  have  close  geographical  links  and  strong  economic \ncomplementarities.  The  PRC  has  advantages  in  producing  consumer  goods  and  industrial \nproducts. The Central Asian SCO members are well endowed with energy, nonferrous metallic \nores, and agricultural resources. The Russian Federation is strong in high-technology products, \nmachine building, processing of raw materials, and energy. These complementarities provide a \nsolid basis for expanding trade, and this requires efficient cross-border and transit transport. \n \n4.  The  SCO  members  depend  to  varying  degrees  on  international  road  transport  for \ndevelopment. The four landlocked Central Asian SCO members\u23afKazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, \nTajikistan, and Uzbekistan\u23afrely heavily on the roads in the PRC and Russian Federation to \naccess major developed markets. The Central Asian SCO members also provide shorter routes \nfrom the PRC and Russian Federation to third countries. SCO members increasingly rely on \ninter-country road networks for bilateral trade. \n                                                 \n1  The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) was established in June 2001 with the goal of strengthening \nmutual trust, friendship and good neighborliness between the participating countries; effectively cooperating in \nbroad economic and social fields; and undertaking joint efforts for regional peace, security, and stability. The six \nmembers signed the SCO Charter at the Second Summit Meeting in Saint Petersburg in June 2002 and approved \nthe establishment of the SCO secretariat at the Third Summit Meeting in Moscow in May 2003. The secretariat was \nset up in Beijing on 15 January 2004. \n2  Joint  Communiqu\u00e9  of  the  Council  of  the  Government  Heads  (Prime  Ministers)  of  Shanghai  Cooperation \nOrganization Member States, 23 September 2004, Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republic. \n3  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 8 October 2004. \n ", "2  \n5.  Despite the increase in number of border crossings for road transport4 and improvement \nof cross-border road infrastructure since the 1990s, nonphysical barriers to efficient cross-\nborder and transit transport by road remain among SCO members. Major nonphysical barriers \ninclude (i) inconsistent policies and procedures among SCO members, (ii) a lack of involvement \non the part of concerned government agencies, and (iii) limited human resource capacity. \nTransport  security  has  also  become  an  emerging  issue.  These  barriers  severely  hinder \ntransport and trade development among SCO members and with other countries. Action must \nbe taken to address them. \n \n6.  The current policies and procedures on cross-border and transit road transport among \nSCO members are less effective. Several factors account for this. First, these policies and \nprocedures vary among SCO members. For example, the PRC and other SCO members have \ndifferent  (i)  road  traffic  rules,  (ii)  driving  permit  requirements,  (iii)  road  signs  and  signals,  \n(iv)  consignment  notes  and  contract  conditions,  (v)  cross-border  and  transit  charges,  and  \n(vi)  regulations  on  the  use  of  Transports  Internationaux  Routier  (TIR  \u2212  international  road \ntransport) vehicles and carnets. Customs procedures among SCO members have not been \nstandardized or harmonized according to international customs instruments.5 Divergent policies \nand procedures have also led to different documentary requirements and standards for cross-\nborder and transit transport among SCO members, creating difficulty for cross-border road \ntransport. Second, the policies and procedures are developed based on domestic experience \nand  are  not  always  consistent  with  international  conventions  or  best  practices.  Third,  the \npolicies and procedures have changed frequently to meet domestic needs, making them difficult \nto  understand  and  observe  for  road  transport  operators.  Fourth,  there  is  often  a  lack  of \ntransparency in formulating policies and procedures, which often creates confusion for road \ntransport operators and traders. These constraints have delayed cross-border and transit road \ntransport and increased corruption. The SCO members need to develop, in a transparent way, a \nmultilateral agreement that harmonizes policies and procedures on cross-border and transit \nroad transport based on international conventions and best practices. \n \n7.  While some SCO members have made arrangements for cross-border and transit road \ntransport, these arrangements have at least two major drawbacks. First, the arrangements are \nprimarily bilateral. Border crossings under the arrangements were at times closed because of \ncontroversy over implementation or other problems between participating countries. Second, the \narrangements  are  mainly  made  by  transport  authorities  with  little  involvement  from  other \ngovernment  agencies  responsible  for  border  crossing  (e.g.  immigration  control,  customs \nclearance, goods inspection, and quarantine). Several government agencies operate separately \nat border crossings, creating barriers to international road transport as some of these agencies \nrequire the same inspections and documents. Clearing cross-border and transit documents at \nborder crossings sometimes takes more time than it does to move goods and people to their \ndestination.6 A multilateral agreement covering all aspects of cross-border and transit transport \nby road would foster the movement of vehicles, goods, and people among SCO members. \n \n8.  There  are  several  existing  regional  transport  agreements  involving  several  SCO \nmembers, among which include the Economic Cooperation Organization Transit Framework \n                                                 \n4  By the end of 2002, 82 border crossings among SCO members had opened for road transport. \n5  SCO members do not recognize each other\u2019s customs seals, inspections, or documents. Each SCO member relies \non its own inspections and checks data based on its domestic requirements. Customs escorts are often required as \npost-entry control measures after border clearance. \n6  According to an UNESCAP study on transit transport issues in landlocked developing countries undertaken in \n2002\u22122003, road transport through an SCO transit country requires 1.6 days but clearance at a border crossing \nbetween two SCO countries takes 3 days. UNESCAP. 2004. Report of Study on Formulation of Shanghai \nCooperation Organization Multilateral Agreement on International Road Transport. Bangkok, Thailand. \n ", "  3\nAgreement  (1998),  the  Agreement  on  International  Transport  for  Development  of  Europe-\nCaucasus-Asia  Corridor  (TRACECA,  1998),  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States \nagreements,  and  the  United  Nations  Economic  Commission  for  Europe\u2019s  agreements  and \nconventions relating to international road transport. However, neither the PRC nor the Russian \nFederation  is  a  member  of  the  Economic  Cooperation  Organization  Transit  Framework \nAgreement  or  the  TRACECA  Agreement.  The  PRC  is  also  not  a  party  to  the  relevant \nagreements of the Commonwealth of Independent States or the United Nations Economic \nCommission for Europe\u2019s agreements and concerned conventions. \n \n9.  Lack of human resource capacity among SCO members is major constraint to efficient \ninternational road transport. Many government agency staff responsible for cross-border and \ntransit road transport have limited knowledge of international conventions or best practices for \ninternational transport and trade. Most frontier stations are remote and officers lack proper \ntraining.  This  has  led  to  inefficient,  ineffective  operations  and  improper  implementation  of \nrelevant agreements, policies, and procedures. Training needs to be provided to strengthen \nhuman resource capacity. \n \n10.  Since 1997, ADB has been promoting regional cooperation through the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program,7 of which the PRC and four Central Asian \ncountries  are  the  members.  The  CAREC  program\u2019s  objectives  are  to  increase  trade  and \nintegration with large markets, reduce costs of transport and facilitate transit, improve supplies \nof energy, and tackle negative externalities. ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program \n(RCSP) for CAREC Member Countries (2005\u22122007)8 identifies transport as a priority area for \nADB assistance. Since members of the CAREC and SCO are largely overlapping and ADB is \nthe lead agency for transport under the CAREC program, it is important that ADB help the SCO \nmembers formulate and implement a multilateral agreement on facilitation of international road \ntransport. The TA is thus consistent with ADB\u2019s RCSP for CAREC members. It would be a good \nbeginning  to  support  development  of  an  enabling  policy  environment  that  complements \ntransport  infrastructure  investments  to  facilitate  regional  transport  cooperation  under  the \nCAREC program. It would also take the transport initiative to a multicountry level, as contrasted \nwith  the  current  focus  on  bilateral  cross-border  agreements9  under  the  CAREC  program.  \nThe TA would be the first step in supporting development of the regional transport agreement in \nEast  and  Central  Asia.  Further  assistance  could  be  provided  subsequently  to  expand  the \nagreement to all CAREC members and other developing member countries in the region. \n \n11.  Three  lessons  learned  from  the  CAREC  program,  the  Greater  Mekong  subregional \ncooperation program, and other regional cooperation programs were applied when formulating \nthe TA. First, high-level authorities\u2019 commitment is the key to the TA\u2019s success. The SCO \nmember governments are strongly committed to conclude the negotiations on the Framework \nAgreement on Facilitation of International Road Transport within the first half of 2005 and the \nprotocols by 2006. The TA design is thus highly relevant and responsive to SCO members\u2019 \nneeds. Second, developing international transport agreements is complex, and a step-by-step \napproach  should  be  taken  to  gradually  improve  existing  arrangements  without  interrupting \ncross-border and transit transport and trade. The TA will take a gradual approach (para. 14). \n                                                 \n7  The members of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program are Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Mongolia, the PRC, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. \n8  ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n ", "4  \nThird, sufficient human resource capacity is crucial to effectively implement the agreement. \nGiven the limited human resource capacity in SCO member countries, the TA includes the \ncomponents  of  advisory  services  and  training  for  relevant  government  officials  and  other \nstakeholders to enhance their capacity for implementing the agreement. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The goal of the TA is to promote transport, trade, and tourism among SCO member \ncountries in support of sustainable and inclusive economic growth. The purpose is to help these \ncountries  formulate  and  implement  an  intergovernmental  agreement  on  facilitation  of \ninternational road transport. The Intergovernmental Agreement on Facilitation of International \nRoad Transport will be consistent with existing international conventions and will take into \naccount ongoing negotiations on the Transit Traffic Agreement Framework among the PRC, \nMongolia, and the Russian Federation.10 \n \n13.  The  TA  will  comprise  the  following  components:  (i)  support  for  negotiating  the \nFramework Agreement on Facilitation of International Road Transport,11 (ii) preparation of eight \nprotocols12 and support for negotiating the protocols, (iii) provision of advisory services and \ntraining  to  concerned  government  officials  and  other  stakeholders  in  SCO  members  for \nimplementing  the  Agreement.  The  expected  TA  outputs  are  (i)  negotiated  Framework \nAgreement and protocols by SCO member governments, and (ii) strengthened capacity of \ngovernment officials and other stakeholders in SCO members for implementing the Agreement. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  Given the complexity of negotiating international transport agreements, the TA will adopt \na step-by-step approach. Support will be extended first for negotiations on the Framework \nAgreement that would set general, principal provisions of international road transport operations \nand list the protocols to be agreed. After the Framework Agreement is finalized, negotiations on \nthe  protocols  would  cover  technical  details  based  on  relevant  international  conventions.  \nThis approach will help achieve results quickly and maintain momentum for cooperation. \n \n15.  The TA has been designed in close collaboration with UNESCAP. The TA proposal was \nendorsed  for  further  development  at  the  ADB-UNESCAP  consultation  meeting  on  the \nmemorandum of understanding (MOU) between ADB and UNESCAP13 on 11 October 2004. \nADB and UNESCAP will make joint efforts during the TA implementation. The TA is an example \nof ADB-UNESCAP cooperation in support of regional cooperation in transport. \n \n                                                 \n10 The PRC, Mongolia, and the Russian Federation are negotiating a draft Transit Traffic Framework Agreement with \nassistance from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Five negotiating meetings have been \nheld and the next will take place in Geneva in December 2004. \n11 The Framework Agreement is expected to have eight parts: (i) general provisions; (ii) transport operations;  \n(iii) traffic safety, security, and environmental protection; (iv) temporary admission of vehicles and containers;  \n(v) facilitation of interstate and transit formalities; (vi) institutional arrangements; (vii) miscellaneous provisions; and \n(viii) final clauses. \n12 The eight protocols cover (i) routes and border-crossings for international road transport, (ii) charges for use of \ninfrastructure, (iii) permits for international road transport, (iv) dangerous goods, (v) weight and dimensions of road \nvehicles, (vi) compulsory third party liability insurance scheme of vehicles, (vii) documentation and procedures for \nfrontier controls, and (viii) terms of reference of the joint working group on facilitation of international road transport. \n13 The memorandum of understanding (MOU) between ADB and UNESCAP signed on 16 May 2004 in Jeju, Republic \nof Korea states that ADB and UNESCAP would explore the potential of cofinancing regional and sub-regional \nprograms and projects. Transport has been identified as a priority area for collaboration under the MOU. \n ", "  5\n16.  The  key  TA  activities  will  include  (i)  assisting  in  preparing  the  protocols  under  the \nAgreement on Facilitation of International Road Transport, (ii) supporting negotiating meetings \nof SCO members on the Framework Agreement and protocols, and (iii) providing advisory \nservices and training to relevant government officials and other stakeholders in SCO members \nfor implementing the Agreement. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total TA cost is estimated at $1,530,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $500,000 on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. UNESCAP will provide $980,000, including $850,000 \nin kind. UNESCAP cash contribution will be in parallel financing to cover the expenses incurred \nby  the  Russian  Federation  including  its  participation  in  negotiating  meetings  and  training.  \nThe SCO member governments will finance the remaining costs in kind by providing offices, \ncounterpart staff, and administrative support. Detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the Executing Agency. The Transport and Communications Division under \nthe East and Central Asia Department will be responsible for implementing the TA. ADB will \ncollaborate closely with UNESCAP, the SCO secretariat, and concerned government agencies \nof SCO members during TA implementation. Before implementation, ADB will sign an MOU or a \nsimilar document with UNESCAP defining roles and responsibilities, as well as tasks of the \nconsultants. ADB may provide some of its contribution to UNESCAP for implementing some TA \ncomponents. \n \n19.  The  TA  will  provide  11  person-months  of  international  consulting  services.  \nTwo  international  consultants  with  expertise  in  international  or  regional  road  transport \nagreements and legal transport will be recruited individually. The consultants to be financed by \nADB  will  be  engaged  according  to  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  Asian \nDevelopment Bank and Its Borrowers. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix 3.  \n \n20.  The  TA  is  expected  to  begin  in  February  2005  and  end  in  December  2007.  \nThe outputs and outcome evaluation will be disseminated at the ministerial conferences, senior \nofficials\u2019  meetings,  and  transport  sector  coordinating  committee  meetings,  as  well  as  the \nCAREC website. \n \nIV.

Introduction \n1.  A total of 11 person-months of international consulting services will be provided under \nthe technical assistance (TA) to help the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) member \ncountries  formulate  and  implement  an  Intergovernmental  Agreement  on  Facilitation  of \nInternational  Road  Transport  (the  Agreement).  The  consultants  should  have  expertise  in \ninternational or regional road transport agreements and will be recruited individually. The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will finance 10 person-months of consulting services, while the United \nNations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific will finance one person-\nmonth of consulting services. The consultants to be financed by ADB will be recruited according \nto the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers.  \nThe outline terms of reference for the consultants follow. \n \nB.  Terms of Reference \n2.  The consultants will undertake the following tasks: \n \n(i)  Assist in preparing for negotiations draft protocols under the Intergovernmental \nAgreement on Facilitation of International Road Transport. Eight protocols to be \nprepared have been tentatively identified as follows: \n \n\u2022  Protocol 1:  Routes and Border-crossings for International Road Transport \n\u2022  Protocol 2:  Charges for Use of Infrastructure \n\u2022  Protocol 3:  Permits for International Road Transport \n\u2022  Protocol 4:  Dangerous Goods \n\u2022  Protocol 5:  Weight and Dimensions of Road Vehicles \n\u2022  Protocol 6:  Compulsory Third Party Liability Insurance Scheme of Vehicles \n\u2022  Protocol 7:  Documentation and Procedures for Frontier Controls \n\u2022  Protocol 8:  Terms of Reference of the Joint Working Group on Facilitation of \nInternational Road Transport \n \n(ii)  Assist in SCO members\u2019 negotiations on the draft Framework Agreement on \nFacilitation of International Road Transport and eight protocols listed in (i) above. \n(iii)  Assist in preparing training materials for relevant government officials and other \nstakeholders  in  the  SCO  members  for  implementing  the  Agreement  on \nFacilitation of International Road Transport, including making arrangements for \ntranslating  the  training  materials  into  Chinese  and  Russian  languages  to  be \nprovided to SCO member governments prior to the training. \n(iv)  Assist in organizing training courses and serve as resource persons for relevant \ngovernment officials and other stakeholders of the SCO members. \n(v)  Provide advisory services to SCO member governments for implementing the \nAgreement on Facilitation of International Road Transport. \n \nC.  Composition of Consultants \n3.  The  consultant  team  comprises  two  international  consultants:  an  international  road \ntransport  specialist  to  be  engaged  for  6  person-months  and  a  transport  legal  expert  for  \n5 person-months. The international road transport specialist will cover technical aspects while \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \nthe transport legal expert will handle legal matters. The two international consultants should \nwork  closely  during  the  assignment.  One  of  the  proposed  consultants  will  also  serve  as \nconsultant team leader responsible for undertaking the assignments and preparing the required \nreports during the TA implementation. \n \nD.
