The  Government  of  Indonesia  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to develop a proposal for a sector development program loan for small \nand medium-sized industrial enterprise development as stated in ADB\u2019s 2003 Country Strategy \nand Program (CSP) and update.1 The ADB Fact-Finding Mission, which started in late March 2003, \nreached an understanding with the Government on the TA objectives, scope, terms of reference, \ncost estimates, and implementation arrangements. The project preparatory TA is  based on the \npolicy recommendations of previous advisory TAs that accompanied the Industrial Competitiveness \nand Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Development Program (the Program)2 and those of \nan ongoing one.3  \n   \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Formulated in the aftermath of the 1997 crisis, the Program aimed to support economic \nrecovery by encouraging a more diversified and competitive industrial structure to provide equal \nopportunities for all enterprises, in particular SMEs. The Program focused on three main areas: \nstrengthening  competition  by  establishing  an  appropriate  legal  and  regulatory  framework  and \nremoving barriers to competition; facilitating investment and trade by strengthening the framework \ngoverning  domestic  and  foreign  investment  and  customs  procedures;  and  developing  a \ncomprehensive and sustainable SME development policy. Progress in the Program implementation \nhas been significant despite the rapidly changing environment. One of these changes has been \ndecentralization, which started to be implemented in 2001, adding new complexities to the role of \ngovernments and opening new and specific areas for reform, in particular, in SME development \nwithin a decentralized environment.  \n \n3.  A complex regulatory environment and lack of financing and business services increase the \ncosts of operating private businesses, especially SMEs in Indonesia, where the cost of starting a \nnew  business  already  stands  out  as  being  one  of  the  highest  in  Asia.4  The  advent  of \ndecentralization has pushed these costs up. Since 2001, following decentralization, regulatory \npowers have been delegated to the regions. Some local governments now make their own rules \nand even raise taxes of dubious merit.5 Multiple and overlapping regulations on trade, tax, and \nregistration, together with a plethora of business licenses, hinder SMEs\u2019 economic contribution. \nAlso,  SMEs  have  limited  access  to  formal  credit,  which  constrains  their  growth  potential \ncompounded by the complexity of the regulatory environment. Finally, SMEs in the regions have \nlimited access to high-quality technical services that are in line with a private sector approach to \nindustrial development. All these constraints explain to a great extent why SMEs(cid:190) mostly informal \nbusinesses(cid:190) have  traditionally  exhibited  much  lower  labor  productivity  than  large  firms  in \nIndonesia, where the productivity gap between small and large firms is one of the largest by \ninternational standards. These constraints need to be carefully addressed under decentralization. \n  \n                                                 \n1  Posted in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 27 May 2003. \n2  ADB. 2000.

Without effective legal, institutional, and regulatory frameworks, markets can malfunction, \nresulting in great cost, particularly for the poor.6 While avoidance of excessive regulations that stifle \nincentives  and  discourage  investment  is  necessary,  effective  regulation  remains  essential  to \nsafeguard the environment; promote financial sector stability; protect consumers; and promote and \nprotect human rights, including core labor standards.7 Indonesia\u2019s highly regulated environment \nhas, however, enormously increased the cost of conducting business. Official and unofficial levies \nare estimated to raise the direct operating costs of SMEs by as much as 30%, and the burden has \nprobably increased in the aftermath of decentralization. Across Asia, Indonesia has the highest \ncost of doing business and, hence, has one of the largest number of informal or unregistered \nbusinesses, especially SMEs. For instance, Indonesian SMEs face high transaction costs as a \nresult of the cumbersome registration and licensing, because, in some sectors, SMEs need to \nsecure as many as 11 licenses, some of which have identical purposes but are issued by different \nagencies. Obtaining licenses takes long and procedures are so complicated that some business \nowners choose to operate informally. Lack of legal status or informality exposes them to corruption, \nand makes it difficult for these businesses to access formal services, most notably bank finance. \nSimplification of these costly licenses and their requirements benefits proportionally more SMEs \nthan large businesses (which can absorb the high cost of conforming with all formalities), as well as \nthe poor.8 \n \n5.  Local governments now have the authority to regulate local businesses but few have taken \nan effective strategic approach to develop local small businesses (see Appendix 1). The primary \nsource of pro-poor growth will be the private sector, and particularly poor people themselves, but, \nto achieve this, government regulations must be effective. The conversion of districts into the major \nunits of government authority has carried the risk of increasing taxes, levies, and other fees \nintroduced by local governments. For example, the district of Bulukumba in South Sulawesi has \ntripled the number of business-related regulations.9 This behavior has not been uncommon among \nthe 416 districts, and will hinder, not promote, SME development in the regions. While existing \ndecentralization laws provide for a regulatory monitoring role by the central Government, the sheer \nvolume of new or revised local regulation makes this task unmanageable. Regulatory streamlining \nand impact monitoring should follow a common, transparent and accountable policy framework for \nregulatory impact assessments (RIA) across regions with the appropriate institutional setup and \ncapacity building.10  \n \n6.  Lack of formal credit for SMEs continues to constrain their development and growth. \nProvincial banks and venture capital companies have less than 15% of their portfolio in industrial \nenterprises, and most credit remains short-term consumer credit. After decentralization, provincial \nand local governments need not keep their funds in provincial banks, which thus need to refocus \ntheir portfolio from consumer to productive credit for small businesses. Considering loans to SMEs \nrisky, most banks limit their credit exposure to them. Group or cluster lending remains off-limits for \n                                                 \n6  GFA Management and Swisscontact Services. 2001.

Measures to supplement or replace collateral, presently mainly land, remain unworkable. \nDirect guarantees to SMEs have worked poorly because of poor risk assessment and risk sharing. \nNew banking practices and new financial products for SMEs need to be assessed and adopted \nwithin the new banking system emerging after the 1997 financial crisis. \n \n7.  To compete, SMEs need to bring their operating costs down by adopting suitable business \ntechnologies. Effectively designed business development services (BDSs) by professionals would \nhelp SMEs improve their equipment, subcontracting, workplace organization, inventory handling, \nproduct design, business planning, etc. Past publicly funded and managed BDS programs have \nnot been successful and do not conform to international best practices in outreach, sustainability, \nand impact.11 Lessons from ADB support to technological institutes show the need for a shift in \napproach.12 In general, subsidized programs through SME incubators, BDS clinics, or technological \ninstitutes have been unsustainable, providing services of limited quality and usefulness to few \nSMEs. These programs have created a culture of \u201cright to free services\u201d among most SMEs. \nProvision  of  technical  support  for  industrial  SMEs  has  been  devolved  to  local  governments, \npresenting the opportunity to adopt new industrial management systems around local industrial \nclusters with a potential competitive edge in tune with the needs of the local private sector. \n \n8.  Recognizing that SMEs are instrumental to improve productivity, create jobs, and, hence, \nreduce poverty, the Government has formulated a comprehensive action plan to be implemented \nby the State  Ministry of Cooperatives and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMOCSME), \nMinistry  of  Industry  and  Trade  (MOIT),  and  National  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS).13 ADB\u2019s \ncountry operational strategy aims at overcoming identified constraints affecting SMEs in the action \nplan,  such  as  burdensome  regulations,  lack  of  access  to  commercial  credit,  and  ineffective \ntechnical  services.  The  strategy  emphasizes  regional  SME  development  consistent  with  the \nDepartment of International Development (DFID, United Kingdom) country strategy,14 which states \nthe need to improve governance for sustained growth and poverty reduction. \n \n9.  The TA will complement various ongoing SME initiatives of ADB15 and other aid agencies. \nThe World Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC) are supporting a private sector TA for \nBDS(cid:190) the Program for Eastern Indonesia SME Assistance (PENSA).16 Japan has an ongoing \nassessment of industrial clusters and BDS training centers for exporters across Indonesia, while \nthe German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) is helping the central Government examine \ndecentralized  SME  policies.  The  Canadian  International  Development  Agency  (CIDA)  and \nSwisscontact have ongoing BDS projects, and The Asia Foundation works on policy advocacy to \nimprove the business climate.  \n                                                 \n11 See Committee of Donor Agencies for SME Development. 2000.

The TA aims to prepare a project proposal to promote pro-poor growth and development of \nSMEs by improving the business climate and increasing access to finance and technology without \ncompeting with private sector initiatives. The TA will focus on the relationship between the central \nGovernment and four core provinces, building the Government\u2019s capacity for strategic policy \nanalysis and coordination, required for a pro-poor policy framework, following a two-step approach \nto adjust to the changing environment of a young decentralized environment. A final output willl be \na proposal for a potential sector development program for possible ADB support with a policy and \ninvestment components to (i) improve the regulatory environment for SMEs at both central and \nregional levels (component A); (ii) enhance SME access to formal financing from public and private \nfinancial institutions, if appropriate (component B); and (iii) enhance local capacity to provide \nsustainable technical advice, if appropriate (Component C).  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The Government and ADB selected the four core provinces (Central and East Java, and \nSouth and North Sulawesi) and two local governments (Sragen in Central Java, and Pare-Pare in \nSouth Sulawesi) on the basis of their proven potential for SME development and willingness to \nwork with the Government and ADB. The TA scope has three major components, which will have \nan assessment phase (phase I, Appendix 2) and a project consultation and preparation phase \n(phase II) as follows: \n \n(i)  Component A is to improve the central, provincial, and local business climate to \nreduce  the  cost  of  doing  business  by  (a)  institutionalizing  regulatory  impact \nassessments and (b) streamlining registration and licensing for businesses. Phase I \nwill examine the extent of the preparation required of the central, provincial, and \nlocal governments. Phase II will focus on the discussion of findings and preparation \nof a potential program for policy and capacity building, including central, provincial, \nand local governments.  \n(ii)  Component B is to provide improved support to regional public and private financial \ninstitutions to enhance their SME portfolio. Phase I will involve the assessment of \nlocal  small  business  needs  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  financial  operations  and  capacity  of \ninstitutions such as venture capital companies; provincial development banks; and \nprivate banks operating or expanding their operations in core provinces, such as \nDanamon, Niaga, NISP, Buana, RaboBank, or Hongkong and Shanghai Banking \nCorporation. Initial assessments will be conducted for sustainable and market-driven \ncollateral-replacement schemes that could benefit SMEs, such as direct guarantee \ncertificates issued by guarantee institutions or  warehouse receipts issued by private \nand public banks. Based on lessons learned, Phase I might lead to preparation of a \nproposal for potential ADB public or private sector interventions, as required under \nPhase II.  \n(iii)  Component C is to improve high-quality and sustainable technical support for SMEs. \nPhase I will involve the assessment of technological centers,17  based  on  ADB \nexperience with these institutes; provinces\u2019 economic potential to turn them into \nproviders  of  sustainable  and  relevant  technical  services  for  SMEs  and  their \n                                                 \n17 The centers were chosen following a cluster approach. For furniture, Industrial Research and Development (R&D) \nInstitute of Semarang, Central Java (IRDIS); for metal industries, the Industrial R&D Institute of Surabaya, East Java \n(IRDISB); for agro-based industries, the Industrial R&D Institute of Ujung Pandang-Makassar, South Sulawesi \n(IRDIUP); and for marine-based industries, the Industrial R&D Institute of Manado, North Sulawesi (IRDIMN). \n ", "    5 \nsuppliers;  and  the  role  of  donor  and  private  institutions  operating  in  the  core \nprovinces. Based on Phase I, Phase II might lead to the preparation of a proposal \nfor ADB support for capacity building to serve SME technological needs.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1 million equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $800,000 equivalent, to cover the entire foreign exchange cost of \n$552,000, and $248,000 equivalent of local currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Government of the United Kingdom. The Government of Indonesia will finance the \nbalance  of  the  local  currency  cost,  equivalent  to  $200,000  through  the  provision  of  office \naccommodation, transport, and staff. See Appendix 3 for cost estimates and financing plan. The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any \nensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The TA Executing Agency will be the MOIT Directorate General for SMEs, which will create \nand  coordinate  a  working  group  of  implementing  agencies:  Agency  for  Research  and \nDevelopment; Directorate General for Domestic Trade, Business Development, and Company \nRegistration Division  of  MOIT;  Directorate  General  for  Financial  Institutions  of  the  Ministry  of \nFinance; and Directorate General for Financing of SMOCSME. Phase I will assess needs under \nComponents A, B, and C, and prepare a midterm report for review by ADB, DFID, and  the \nGovernment.  Phase  II  will  consolidate  and  discuss  with  stakeholders  the  findings  and \nrecommendations of Phase I and integrate them into a joint final proposal for submission to ADB \nand the Government.  \n \n14.  The consultants will be based most of the time at MOIT in Jakarta and are expected to have \na full-time consultant in Makassar, South Sulawesi, at the provincial Office for Industry and Trade \nto serve as contact for North and South Sulawesi.  \n \n15.  The consultants will submit inception (Phase I), midterm (Phase II), draft final, and final \nreports to the Government and ADB. The inception report (Phase I) will be submitted 1 month after \nthe TA starts; the midterm report, 5 months after; a draft report, 8 months after; and the final report, \n10 months after. All reports will be discussed with the Government, ADB, and DFID during the TA. \n \n16.  The TA will require a total of 64 person-months (part- or full-time) of consulting input, \nincluding 28 person-months of international and 36 person-months of domestic consultants over 10 \nmonths, starting in or about April 2004 and ending in or about January 2005. Consultants will be \nrecruited  through  a  firm  (using  the  simplified  technical  proposal)  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement of domestic consultants. Their terms of reference are in Appendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to the Government of \nIndonesia to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom\u2019s Department \nfor International Development for preparing the Provincial Small and Medium Industrial Sector \nDevelopment Program, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nIMPROVING LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND REDUCING SET-UP COSTS:  \nCASE STUDY FROM CENTRAL JAVA \n \n1.  Implemented  in  January  2001,  decentralization  has  seen  a  marked  increase  in \nregulation of local small businesses. The potential for wide and damaging regional variation in \nregulations needs to be mitigated, and local and provincial governments must ensure that their \neconomic policies are also in the national interest. While the decentralization law provides for a \nregulatory monitoring role by the central government, the sheer volume of new or revised local \nregulation  makes  this  task  unmanageable.  Systematic  regulatory  streamlining  and  impact \nmonitoring  functions  should  extend  to  the  local  level,  providing  a  uniform  framework  for \nbusiness regulations and impact assessment across regions. \n   \nFigure A1: Processed Licenses before and after a One-\nStop Service Office\nSragen, Central Java, Jan-Sep 2002 and Jan-Sep 2003\n70\nWithout OSS With OSS\nh  60\nnt\nMo 50\na \ns  40\ne\ns\nn\ne 30\nc\nLi\nof  20\no. \nN 10\n0\nConstruction Anti-nuisance Industrial Trade\nLicenses\n           Source:  Sragen\u2019s OSS Office staff estimates. \n \n2.  The local government of Sragen1 in Central Java shows the case of a typical district \nstriving to support better regulations under decentralization. Forty-five minutes away from the \ncity of Solo, Sragen has a population of 850,000 people, of whom 48% are classified as poor. \nSragen\u2019s labor force earns a living mostly in agriculture, with an annual average income of $98 \na month. The new head of the local government came into office in 2001, and has since \ncounted on the support of the local parliament to improve infrastructure and increase local \nsupport to the garment, furniture, and handicraft industries. Pak H. Untung Wiyono, an engineer \nturned businessman, is aware that agriculture alone cannot support the people of Sragen, and \nthat the local economy requires diversification into labor-intensive industries to create jobs. \n \n3.  Promoting easier access to business licenses an incentive he aims to create. The World \nBank estimates that registering a business (limited company status) takes 168 days and 11 \nsteps, the longest process in Asia. One third of all businesses in Sragen have no legal status, \nand only 1% is a limited company. \n \n4.  In October 2002, with support from the Asian Development Bank technical assistance, \nSragen moved to integrate local government agencies to provide licenses from a centralized \n                                                 \n1  One of the four districts under TA 3829  (footnote 3). \n ", "Appendix 1  7 \nlocal office known as one-stop service (OSS). The move meant that all the different government \nagencies represented within the local government would surrender authority to a single office.  \n \n5.  Efficiency has improved dramatically. The four most common licenses provided by local \ngovernments, for example, are permits for construction, anti-nuisance, industrial permit, and \ntrade permit(cid:190) together providing on average about one third of Sragen\u2019s revenues, shared by all \ngovernment agencies (1% funds the OSS office). With the introduction of the OSS office, run by \n27 staff, license processing has increased substantially: from 43% for trade permits to 126% for \nconstruction permits. Fewer days are required to obtain a license. The complex construction \npermit, which once took 15 days to get, now takes just 7. In Karang Anyar, however, next door \nto Sragen, a construction permit takes up to 35 days. In Sragen an anti-nuisance, industrial, or \ntrade permit takes only an average of 5 days to get, significantly shorter than before OSS.  \n \n6.  Office manager Pak M. Isnadi emphasized accountability by introducing the use of a \ntracking time sheet to find out who was processing a specific document at each stage and how \nlong the person took to process it. The result is a faster turnover of documents. Mr. Isnadi takes \npride in a team of 27 young and motivated staff who have good academic qualifications to \nperform their administrative tasks (one third of them have at least three years or more of higher \neducation), and who undergo regular training on new techniques such as monitoring customer \nsatisfaction through feedback. The last survey indicated that 74% of OSS visitors appreciate the \nservices offered. One result of the feedback, but not the only one, was air-conditioning the \nwaiting room and placing magazines in it.  \n \n7.  An efficient OSS makes the old system easier to manage but does not improve it. Mr. \nIsnadi  said  that  prospective  owners  of  hair  salons  in  Sragen  were  required  to  have  an \nantinuisance license. He brought the issue to the attention of the district\u2019s leader (\u201cbupati\u201d) and \ndistrict\u2019s  parliament.  After  a  discussion  in  parliament,  the  bupati  signed  a  new  regulation \neliminating the license requirement, which represented on average savings of about Rp200,000 \n($25) every 5 years for most of these female-owned businesses.  \n \n8.  Sragen\u2019s OSS now aims to improve its standards of public service and hopes to obtain \nan ISO9001 certification for service, start working on the electronic handling of files, and soon \nprovide licenses online (e-government). Public administration appears to be determined to \nerase the common perception of a complex bureaucratic system without solution, and move \ncloser  a  regime  where  improvement  in  public  administration  eases  the  initial  pains  of \ndecentralization, but, more important, have regulations serve the common interest.  \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK FOR PHASE I
