RATIONALE: BACKGROUND, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Kazakhstan Economy: Overview and Outlook \n2.  Kazakhstan maintained its solid economic growth in 2006 (in excess of 7.4% during \nJanuary\u2013June  2006)  based  on  foreign  direct  investments  in  the  energy  sector,  increased \npipeline export capacity, conservative fiscal and monetary policy balancing increased public \nprograms  with  price  stability,  and  strong  banking  system  regulation  and  supervision.  The \ncountry has benefited recently from higher oil prices and greater exports, both of which have \nincreased  foreign  currency  inflow  and  assisted  debt-servicing  efforts.  For  these  economic \nstrengths, Kazakhstan is rated Baa1 by Moody\u2019s and BBB by Standard and Poor\u2019s, with a \npositive/stable outlook. Appendix 1 provides details on the country\u2019s macroeconomic outlook. \n \n3.  Nevertheless, Kazakhstan\u2019s high dependence on oil exports poses a potential threat for \nthe economy given potential volatility in the international oil market. Small- and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) and manufacturing are currently underrepresented in the national economy.1 \nBecause, the SME sector is relatively more labor-intensive, providing approximately 40% of total \nemployment,  SME  growth  is  significantly  more  inclusive  and  pro-poor  in  nature.  Therefore \ncreating conditions for growth of the SME sector is of key importance. In striving to diversify the \neconomy, especially by developing the SME sector,2 the Government has a declared policy of \nfostering  SME  development  by  promulgating  SME  laws3 and  establishing  organizations  to \nimplement this policy.4  \n \n4.  SME development is hampered by the difficulty in accessing capital, especially debt \nfinancing, at sustainable market rates; and the lack of confidence of SME entrepreneurs in the \nbanking subsector, which is still burdened with an image created during the Soviet time. In an \neconomy where access to capital is constrained and banks have a legacy problem of attracting \ncustomers, as they are not seen as reliable funding sources, serious negative consequences \ncan arise. These hurdles must be overcome if Kazakhstan wants to move out of its heavy \ndependence on oil exports and to develop the SME segment, especially manufacturing. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 The SME sector is estimated to have contributed only 14%\u201315% of GDP in 2005. \n2  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program (2004\u20132006): Kazakhstan. Manila, 17. \n3 Law on State Support to Development of Small Business in the Republic of Kazakhstan. \n4 The policy includes various support measures, provision of services via business development centers, and small \n \nbusiness  loans.  An  exhibition  and  information  center  (a  wholly  state-owned  joint-stock  company)  works  in \naccordance with the Government's program to support SMEs. In addition, the Government set up the SME Support \nFund in 1997 as a nonbanking financial institution. The fund\u2019s main objective is to effectively use financial \nresources allocated within the framework of state and regional programs for projects and activities aimed at \nsupporting SMEs. The fund is tasked to (i) broaden access to finance for SMEs, (ii) effectively use state and \nnonstate resources aimed at SME support, (iii) develop SME infrastructure, and (iv) provide consultations for SMEs. \n ", "2   \nB.  Banking and Capital Markets in Kazakhstan \n5.  Improvements in the economic and operating environment of Kazakhstan\u2019s financial \nsector  have  resulted  in  rapid  growth  during  the  past  5  years,  leading  to  enhanced \ncreditworthiness and commercial profiles for domestic banking. In particular, the Government \nand National Bank of Kazakhstan, the central bank, have undertaken structural reforms to \npromote consolidation and improve the overall viability of the banking system. \n \n6.  Encouraged by this improving macroeconomic environment and robust growth, Kazakh \nbanks have increased lending volumes by an average of more than 40% per year (albeit from a \nvery  low  base),  while  generally  maintaining  healthy  asset  quality  and  profitability.  This  is \nespecially true for the top performers within the first two tiers of the banking system. Market \nobservers expect this pace of growth to be sustained throughout 2006. Appendices 2 and 3 \nprovide a more detailed analysis of the Kazakh banking system. \n \n7.  One of the key challenges facing the financial sector is the development of the nascent \n(debt and equity) capital markets, especially with respect to the corporate sector (Appendix 2). \nTo widen their access to funding, many banks are keen to enter the securitization markets. \n \nC.  Securitization: Overview \n1.  The Global Scenario  \n8.  Securitization has emerged as one of the dominant means of capital formation through-\nout the world, particularly in the United States (US) and Europe. Each year trillions of dollars of \nsecuritization transactions are structured by a wide range of entities such as financial institutions, \nautomobile  financiers,  leasing  companies,  credit  card  issuers,  infrastructure  and  insurance \ncompanies, governments, and local authorities. \n9.  Asset-backed securitization is a highly structured financing technique that provides an \nentity with an economical means of financing without the added burden of increasing debt \nand/or equity. In its simplest form, securitization is a process whereby the revenue stream of a \nsegregated pool of receivables or other income-producing (mostly financial) assets owned by an \noriginal  lender  or  commercial  enterprise  (originator)  is  repackaged  into  tradable  securities \nissued to investors. The receivables are sold by the originator to a specially incorporated, off-\nbalance sheet company or trust, known as a special purpose vehicle (SPV). In return, the SPV \nwill generally pay a purchase amount equal to the (par or net present) value of the receivables, \nwith limited recourse or no recourse against the originator for nonperformance of the underlying \ndebtors. Appendix 4 provides a general description of the securitization process. \n10.  In developed markets, asset securitization serves a number of purposes: (i) supporting \npublic policy objectives such as broad home ownership and development of financial markets \n(especially capital, retail, and mortgage markets); (ii) addressing regulatory requirements for \nfinancial institutions, especially capital adequacy and lending limit requirements applicable to \nbanks; (iii) transferring risk, especially in the context of nonperforming assets and portfolio \ndiversification; and (iv) providing an alternative means of raising finance. \n2.  Securitization in Asia \n11.  Although securitization has gained wide acceptance in other parts of the world, it is still \nin its nascent stages in Asia. In the Republic of Korea, banks turned to securitization following a \n ", "    3\nstringent period of bank restructuring, adding an extra measure of liquidity. Elsewhere in Asia, \nsecuritization is still not being regularly accessed. Issuance of asset-backed securities in the \nregion has been dominated by Australia, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, which account for \naround two thirds of overall issuance, followed by Hong Kong, China; Malaysia; Singapore; and \nTaipei,China. A strong argument can be made favoring the growth of asset securitization in \ncountries with developing capital markets. Many Asian countries are uniquely positioned to gain \nfrom the evolution of securitization in the region. \n \n12.  For Asian corporations, asset securitization provides a new and potentially cheaper form \nof financing. For loan originators such as banks, securitization is a means of removing assets \nfrom the balance sheet, while retaining most of the economic benefits associated with the \nassets and of freeing up capital to support further loan underwriting, while better matching \nassets and liabilities. For investors in Asia, including banks, unit trusts, and pension funds, the \nsecurities issued offer yields exceeding those on comparable corporate bonds, while providing \nan opportunity to diversify a fixed-income portfolio by adding another class of securities. \n13.  Securitization is already proving to be an important option for governments seeking to \npromote  private-sector  growth  and  employment,  and  to  access  funding  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment. In addition, and because asset-backed deals are usually large and have high \ncredit ratings, the securities tend to be liquid and may be actively traded in secondary markets. \nThis  promotes  capital  market  development  and  enhances  the  competitiveness  of  regional \nfinancial centers. Appendix 5 provides a more detailed overview of the various benefits derived \nfrom securitization. \n \nD.  Future Flow and Diversified Payment Rights Securitization \n1.  Future Flow Securitization \n14.  Future  flow  securitization  became  popular  in  emerging  markets  in  the  1990s  as  a \nmechanism to reduce sovereign-related risk and provide more attractive access to international \ncapital  markets  for  the  stronger  emerging  market  issuers.  A  future  flow  transaction  is  a \nsecuritization of a company\u2019s future and existing receivables that are due from offshore obligors. \nFuture flow securitizations mitigate many of the sovereign risks associated with an emerging \nmarket borrower by capturing cash flows offshore. Appendix 6 gives a more detailed description \nof the structure of future flow securitization transactions. \n \n15.  This securitization technique has grown in the emerging markets over the past 15 years, \nprimarily in response to the search for lower cost funding by companies that generate hard \ncurrency flows. While many of these issuers historically relied upon bank debt and straight \ncapital-market bond debt, the volatility and risk perception within emerging markets pushed \nthese  entities  toward  future  flow  securitizations.  Future  flow  investments  have  consistently \nproven themselves to investors, and over the years they have successfully mitigated a variety of \nthe  risks  associated  with  emerging  market  investments.  Of  all  future  flow  transactions \nworldwide, none has so far defaulted. Appendix 7 gives details of outstanding future flow asset-\nbacked securities deals. \n \n2.  Diversified Payment Rights Securitization \n16.  In a diversified payment rights (DPR) securitization, the future cash flows result from \npayment orders or electronic messages requested by offshore obligors instructing a bank to \nmake a payment to a beneficiary other than the bank. This may take the form of payments to \n ", "4   \nlocal  exporters,  foreign  direct  investments,  tourism-related  payments  to  travel  agencies, \npersonal wire transfers or workers\u2019 remittances, and payments to local service providers.5 \nAppendix 8 provides a brief overview and introduction to DPR securitizations. \n \n17.  The first major securitization deal involving migrant remittances occurred in 1994 in \nMexico. During 2000\u20132004, a total of $10.4 billion was raised through DPR securitization by \nBrazil, Turkey, El Salvador, Mexico, and Peru.6 2005 was the highest issuance year with close \nto $10 billion in total volume.7  \n \n18.  In  Kazakhstan,  future  flow  DPR  transactions  are  only  beginning  to  be  introduced. \nTransactions completed since 2001 are listed in Table 1.  \n \nTable 1: Future Flow Transactions from 2001 to 2005 \n \n      Standard and  Closing  Amount \nOriginator  Product  Class  Poor\u2019s Rating  Date  ($ million) \nHalyk Savings Bank   Future flows  \u2014  \u2014  Oct 2003  100 \nJSC Kazkommertsbank  Future flows  2005A  AAAa  Dec 2005  200 \n\u2014 = not available. \na With credit enhancement.

THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT \nA.  Background \n19.  ADB  has  been  active  in  promoting  the  Asian  Bond  Market  Initiative,8 which  was \nproposed by the Government of Japan in December 2002 and under which various efforts to \ndevelop bond markets have been under way within the framework of ASEAN+3 (Japan, the \nPRC, and the Republic of Korea). ADB promotes the Asian Bond Market Initiative inter alia \nthrough the use of its guarantee products. \n \n \n                                                 \n5  Payments to banks relating to such payment orders are owned by the bank and not the named beneficiary. In other \nwords, the receiving bank does not act as a trustee of these funds but the bank is performing a service for the \nsending bank, gets paid for doing so by the sending bank (and thus becomes the owner of these flows) and incurs \na matching obligation to the beneficiary. In this regard such payments are similar to deposits made into a deposit \naccount. While the bank will have an obligation to pay the local beneficiary (recipient) an equivalent amount of \nmoney (in the stipulated currency), the bank does not have the obligation to deliver the exact same funds received \nfrom the sender (money is fungible). In other words, during the period from the receipt of the funds from the sender \nby the bank (from its foreign branch or correspondent bank) up to the stipulated delivery for the funds by the bank \nto the local beneficiary, the bank has effective title to these funds (similar to the 2-day float after a check is \ndeposited). On a continuing basis, the average daily float can be calculated and made the basis of the amount of \nforeign currency received and then assigned to the SPV. From this perspective, what the bank is assigning is its \nexpected float and not the remittances themselves that it expects to transact from foreign senders. \n6  Dilip Ratha (Senior Economist and Lead Author of Global Economic Prospects 2006: Economic Implications of \nRemittances and Migration, World Bank, Washington D.C. 18 November 2005. \n7  Fitch Ratings. Future Flow Securitization Rating Methodology. 15 February 2006. \n8The Asian Bond Market Initiative was launched as a measure to prevent the recurrence of the Asian currency crisis \nby channeling funds in the Asian region, which is characterized by a high savings rate, to investments within the \nregion. Currently, discussions are under way among the governments of ASEAN+3 countries on ways to develop \nand invigorate bond markets in Asian countries. \n ", "    5\nB.  Fit to Country Strategy  \n20.  In view of the Government\u2019s medium-term targets for 2010, the development of a vibrant \nand competitive private sector is vital to ensure economic diversification as well as balanced \nand inclusive development. The Government has a particular focus on SME development, and \non deepening and developing the financial sector. The ADB program, as set out in the private \nsector development section of the 2006\u20132008 country strategy and program update,9 seeks to \ncomplement the Government\u2019s efforts by increasing activities in private sector operations.10 \nPrivate sector operations will focus on the financial sector and capital markets.11 As a result, the \ncountry  strategy  and  program  update  (i)  emphasizes  the  Government\u2019s  policy  on  SME \ndevelopment to create jobs and recommends ADB assistance by providing credit to SMEs via \ndomestic banks and (ii) identifies the need to deepen capital markets. \n \n21.  The proposed Guarantee directly responds to this country strategy by (i) providing a new \nstructure of funding, and in the process, deepening the securitization market specifically for \nmedium-sized financial institutions; and (ii) fostering financial intermediation for SMEs. Indirectly, \nthe assistance also supports rural area development, as ALB is providing loans to SMEs in \nthese areas.  \n \n22.  Moreover,  ADB\u2019s  private  sector initiatives  are  part  of  a wider  effort  to  improve  the \nefficiency  of  the  financial  sector,  as  these  are  accompanied  by  policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment to enable both a strong financial sector and reform in SME finance. ADB has \nundertaken various projects to increase private sector development in Kazakhstan.12  \n \nIV.  THE PROJECT SPONSORS \nA.  Alliance Bank JSC \n1.  Overview and History \n23.  ALB  was  incorporated  in  1993  as  an  open  joint  stock  company  under  the  name \nIrtyshBusinessBank JSC. It merged with Semipalatinsk City Bank in 1999. The combined bank \nprimarily served large industrial enterprises in the Eastern Kazakhstan and Pavlodar regions. In \n2001, a consortium of domestic companies acquired a 37% interest in the bank, which in 2002 \nchanged its name to Alliance Bank and relocated its headquarters to Almaty, Kazakhstan\u2019s \nfinancial center. In 2004, ALB was reregistered as the joint stock company Alliance Bank JSC.  \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008): Kazakhstan. Manila. \n10 In October 2004, the Government signed the framework agreement signaling the start of ADB private sector \noperations in Kazakhstan. \n11 ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program (2004\u20132006): Kazakhstan. Manila, p. 20. \n12  For instance, the objectives of the Urban Small Business Development technical assistance were to promote \ndevelopment of the urban SME sector, review the legal and regulatory framework for SMEs, and foster financial \nintermediation (ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Kazakhstan for Preparing the Urban Small \nBusiness Development Project. Manila). Most recently, the Financial Sector Governance Phase II technical \nassistance seeks to foster a sound, efficient, and broad financial system by strengthening the supervision of banks, \naccumulation  of  pension  funds,  and  operations  of  asset  management  companies  (ADB.  2005.  Technical \nAssistance to the Republic of Kazakhstan for Financial Sector Governance Phase II. Manila). This assistance will \nplay a central role in supporting ADB\u2019s private sector operations in the financial sector and in strengthening \ndomestic banks.  \n ", "6   \n24.  As of 30 June 2006, ALB was the fourth largest commercial bank in Kazakhstan by \nreference to its assets of $4.4 billion, the fourth largest as measured by shareholders\u2019 equity of \n$282 million, and the fourth largest in terms of total time deposits (including retail deposits) of \n$1.05 billion.  \n \n2.  The Business \n25.  ALB is authorized to act as a commercial bank and to offer a wide range of traditional \nbanking services, including deposit taking, lending, issuing letters of credit and guarantees, and \nothers.  ALB\u2019s  primary  business  consists  of  retail  and  corporate  banking.  Its  retail  banking \nactivities include lending and deposit taking as well as providing payment cards. Its corporate \nbanking division provides a broad range of banking products to a diversified group of domestic \ncustomers, with particular focus on SMEs.  \n \n3.  Credit Ratings  \n26.  Currently, ALB is rated by two rating agencies: Fitch IBCA (Fitch) and Moody\u2019s Investors \nService (Moody\u2019s) (Table 2). \n \nTable 2: Alliance Bank Credit Ratings \nFitch  Moody\u2019s \nLong-term  BB-  Long-term  Ba2 \nOutlook  Stable  Outlook  Positive \nSource: Alliance Bank JSC. \n \nB.  Merrill Lynch \n27.  Merrill Lynch was selected as Lead Manager for the proposed DPR securitization. Merrill \nLynch  is  one  of  the  world's  leading  wealth  management,  capital  markets,  and  advisory \ncompanies, with offices in 36 countries and territories and total client assets of approximately \n$1.8 trillion at the end of second quarter 2006. The Global Markets & Investment Banking Group \nis one of the world\u2019s top global investment banks, providing institutional sales and trading, \ninvestment banking advisory and capital raising services to corporations, governments, and \ninstitutions worldwide; and is one of the leaders in securitization, especially with respect to DPR \nsecuritization. \n \nV.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \nA.  Overview \n28.  The proposed transaction is a credit guarantee to be issued in favor of investors in notes \nwith total issuance size of up to $100 million backed by DPRs originated by ALB. The entire \nissuance will consist of two series of notes, $100 million guaranteed by ADB (Series A) and up \nto $100 million unguaranteed notes (Series B).  The placement of the Series B notes will be \ndependent on market demand. \n \n ", "    7\n29.  DPRs  usually  take  the  form  of  SWIFT13 MT102,  103,14 and  202  payment  order \nmessages.15 These  payment  orders  are  generated  as  part  of  the  international  financial \noperations  of  ALB.  Payment  orders  are  created  as  a  result  of  ALB\u2019s  role  as  a  financial \nintermediary between foreign payors wishing to send funds to Kazakhstan and residents of \nKazakhstan receiving these funds. ALB proposes to securitize its MT100 and MT200 DPRs, \ndenominated in US dollars, euros, and (potentially) Russian rubles (ALB DPRs).  \n \n30.  Similar to the role of a traditional monoline insurer, ADB will provide credit enhancement \nto the investors in the notes in the form of a credit guarantee. ADB\u2019s Guarantee will cover timely \npayment of principal and interest of the guaranteed notes. ADB will syndicate part of this \nexposure.  \n \n31.  The recently disbursed $50 million loan to ALB will be used as the anchor investment of \nthe proposed Guarantee.  \nVI.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND RISKS \nA.  Justification  \n32.  ADB\u2019s objective in the proposed transaction is (i) to develop Kazakhstan\u2019s securitization \nmarket to (a) diversify funding options; (b) procure access to longer term funds, specifically for \nmedium-sized private sector banks; and (c) attract a new set of investors; and (ii) to foster SME \nfinancing in Kazakhstan.  \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s proposed Guarantee will increase interest in DPR securitization from Kazakhstan. \nBy establishing a credit history for ALB, the proposed Project enhances its ability to raise funds \nin international capital markets, obtain longer tenor funds as currently possible in the market, \nand build market confidence in medium-sized banks. ALB\u2019s business lines generating DPRs will \nbe under constant scrutiny by rating agencies forcing ALB to adopt and comply with best market \npractices. For the investor, the proposed transaction will provide access to a new market; \ndiversify  its  portfolio;  and  presumably  receive  higher  returns  than  government,  bank,  and \ncorporate bonds. The transaction will boost investor and creditor confidence, both international \nand domestic, in Kazakhstan\u2019s banking system, and increase depositor confidence in the local \neconomy and banking system. \n \n34.  ADB\u2019s second objective to foster SME financing, involves helping ALB to increase its \nSME loan portfolio by providing part of the needed debt funding, and in turn, helping the \nGovernment in its efforts to steer the Kazakh economy toward more sustainable SME-led \ngrowth while diversifying away from the dominance and dependence on natural resources \nindustries. The Project allows ALB to extend the tenor of its borrowings to up to 7 years, 2 years \nlonger than the maximum tenor it has been able to obtain from the market. In turn ALB will be \n                                                 \n13  Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) is an international messaging system \nowned and maintained by the member banks (payment order only, no settlement). MT103/103+ are sent by the \nordering customer\u2019s bank to the beneficiary\u2019s bank and are used to convey a funds transfer instruction.  \n14  MT102 is principally a set of bulked customer transfers that meet certain criteria (e.g., common correspondent \nbanks, common currency or common value date). MT103 is a customer transfer wherein either the sending party or \nthe payer or both is not a financial institution. MT103 is a more structured version. MT202 relates to payment \norders from senders to payees that are financial institutions. \n15  MT100 (including MT102, 103) is the standard message type for payment orders relating to payment from senders \nto payees who are individuals, companies (other than financial institutions), or governments through banks. MT \n200 (including MT202) is the standard message type for payment orders relating to payment from senders to \npayees that are financial institutions. \n ", "8   \nable to lengthen its tenor for its customers. The transaction will therefore bridge an unwanted \nmaturity gap and allow ALB to match its assets and liabilities more closely. In addition, the \nsecuritization will allow ALB to access lower cost funds, which will make ALB more competitive \nand allow it to pass savings to its customers.  \n \nB.  Social and Environmental Safeguard Policies  \n \n35.  The proposed transaction has been assigned a \u201cC\u201d environmental classification and a \n\u201cC\u201d with respect to indigenous people and resettlement. A desk review and onsite visit of ALB\u2019s \nDPR operations shows that these business activities have no anticipated adverse impact on the \nenvironment.  \n \nC.  Anticorruption Policy, and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism \n \n36.  ALB has been advised of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy16 and policy relating to combating \nmoney laundering and the financing of terrorism.17 In connection with ADB\u2019s recent loan to ALB, \nALB has undertaken to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls \nfollowing  international  best  practice  standards  for  preventing  corruption,  money  laundering \nactivities, and the financing of terrorism. Further, ALB has undertaken to refrain from engaging \nin such activities. The loan documentation between ADB and ALB allows ADB to investigate any \nviolation or potential violation of these undertakings. ALB is expected to give a similar covenant \nunder the insurance and indemnity agreement. \n \n37.  ALB will not be allowed to use the proceeds of the proposed transaction in any country \nidentified under (i) The Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, 50 U.S.C.A. of the United States of \nAmerica; (ii) the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C.A. of the United \nStates of America; (iii) the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools \nRequired to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act), Pub.

Transaction Risks \n \n38.  ADB conducted comprehensive due diligence to determine the viability of the proposed \nguarantee. Overall, the risks can be regarded as acceptable for a transaction of this kind.  \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n39.  ADB will enter into a guarantee agreement and other required investment documents, \nfollowing approval of the proposed Guarantee by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors. These agreements \nwill be on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n40.  A framework agreement relating to ADB\u2019s status, privileges, and immunities with respect \nto its lending and guarantee operations in the private sector is in effect between Kazakhstan \nand  ADB.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed  ADB \nGuarantee. The Guarantee will not be made effective until ADB receives such confirmation. \n                                                 \n16  ADB. 1998. Anticorruption. Manila. \n17  ADB. 2003.

Economic Outlook \n \n1.  High oil prices, foreign investment, and good macroeconomic management underlie the \ncontinuing economic boom in this oil-rich export economy. Gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth, led by the oil subsector, averaged 10.3% per annum during 2001\u20132005. GDP growth \nreached 9.4% in 2005 and is set to grow to $65.3 billion in 2006 and $84.8 billion in 2008. \nFurthermore, representing 65% of GDP, the private sector is increasingly driving growth in the \neconomy.1  \n \n2.  These factors helped lift 2005 general budget revenues by 4.7 percentage points to \n28.2% of GDP. This large gain was somewhat offset by the increase in budgetary spending \nbefore the December presidential election. The general government budget recorded a surplus \nof 0.6% of GDP, from a slight deficit of 0.3% in 2004. In view of its strong financial position, the \nGovernment made early repayments totaling $850 million on its external public debt, reducing \nthe total to about 4% of GDP at end-2005. The 2006 state budget was approved in November \n2005. It raised revenues by 2% of the previous year\u2019s GDP, reflecting government projections \nfor  greater  receipts  from  oil.  The  increase  is  earmarked  for  public  investment  and  social \nprograms.2 \n \n3.  High world commodity prices helped boost exports by 40.0% to $28.7 billion; oil and \nmetals accounted for more than two thirds of the increase. Imports also increased by 37%, \ndriven largely by machinery, equipment, and nonprecious metals. The trade surplus improved \nby about 45% to $9.8 billion, but the deficit on the services, income, and transfers account \nworsened  sharply.  The  latter  stemmed  from  greater  payments  for  construction,  freight, \ninsurance, and information technology services, as well as a near doubling of income payments \nto foreign direct investors, nearly all associated with oil sector development. Consequently, the \ncurrent account surplus in 2005 improved only marginally from a year earlier to $750 million \n(about 1.3% of GDP). For the first time in 5 years, official reserves at the National Bank of \nKazakhstan (NBK) declined, although they recovered substantially in the first 2 months of 2006 \n(footnote 2). \n \n4.  Gross official reserves stood at $7.1 billion at end-2005 (equivalent to 37 months of \nimports of goods and services); while year-end foreign asset holdings of the National Fund of \nthe Republic of Kazakhstan, which saves a part of the Government\u2019s oil and mineral revenues \nfor future generations, amounted to $8.0 billion. During the year, the total of official reserves and \nfund  assets  strengthened  by  about  $684  million  (about  1.2%  of  GDP)  to  $15.1  billion. \nOutstanding public external debt was reduced by about $1.0 billion to $2.4 billion (about 4.2% of \nGDP) in the 9 months to end-September 2005. During this period, private sector external debt \n(excluding oil and gas intracompany debt) increased sharply by $4.6 billion to $16.6 billion \n(about 33% of GDP). The upsurge in private debt in recent years\u2014mainly local bank borrowing \nfor onlending\u2014was largely a response to the differential between available foreign borrowing \nrates and domestic lending rates of about 15% for tenge loans and 11% for loans denominated \nin foreign currency (footnote 2). \n \n                                                 \n1 European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and Merrill Lynch estimate. This is up from 55% of GDP in \n1998. \n2  ADB. 2006. Asian Development Bank Outlook 2006. Manila. ", "    Appendix 1  11\n5.  The tenge continued to appreciate against the dollar (2.9%) on an average annual basis, \nreflecting export earnings, foreign direct investment, and private external borrowing. However, \ntighter market conditions in the final months of 2005 resulted in a 2.2% depreciation on an end-\nof-year basis. As in the previous year, the real effective exchange rate rose by about 6% year-\non-year, due to inflation differentials. Largely because of future substantial oil-related revenues, \nreal appreciation may continue in 2006 (footnote 2).   \n \n6.  The  medium-term  outlook  is  positive,  assuming  buoyant  oil  prices,  foreign  direct \ninvestment inflows, continuation of economic diversification, good macroeconomic management, \nand political stability. In 2006, GDP growth is expected to be sustained at 8.5%. Moreover, \nmacroeconomic stabilization should continue, with inflation estimated at about 6.5% in 2006. \nDespite  recent  substantial  increases  in  wages  and  social  spending,  the  Government  has \nmaintained sustainable fiscal and monetary policies, which have limited budget deficits and \ninflation. General government debt will continue to decrease in the next few years by about \n1.0%\u20131.5%  of  GDP  annually.  Additionally,  with  the  National  Reserve  Fund  for  excess  oil \nearnings and tax revenues expected to reach about $7.4 billion by year-end 2005, a substantial \nfiscal buffer has been created.3 Despite increased external borrowing by commercial banks, the \noverall external position remains strong.\n \n \n7.  Overall growth during 2000\u20132004 was led by strong contributions from capital and total \nfactor productivity. The contribution of labor accumulation declined continuously, suggesting that \nthe  economy  is  likely  approaching  full  employment.  According  to  government  data,  the \ncontributions of capital accumulation, total factor productivity, and labor growth to the average \nGDP rate of expansion of 10.4% in 2000\u20132004 were 6%, 3.2%, and 1.2% (footnote 2, 98\u201399).  \n \n8.  The hydrocarbons sector has grown at an average of 16% a year since 2000, and will \nremain the engine of growth in the medium term. Its share in GDP, including production and \nrelated services, jumped from 11% in 2000 to almost 25% in 2005, and is expected to continue \nrising  as  production  capacity  increases.  Sector  growth  has  been  fueled  by  large  capital \ninvestments; oil and gas have received 60% of total investment, equivalent to 15% of GDP \nduring 2000\u20132005. Two thirds of the oil and gas investment came from the private sector. The \nshare of hydrocarbons in GDP will increase over the medium term as large projects come \nonstream, although investment in the sector is expected to taper off as a share of total fixed \ninvestment (footnote 2). \n \n9.  Non-oil output has risen at an average of 7% a year since 2000 and been sustained at \nthe rate of 25% of total investment, representing 6.5% of GDP during 2000\u20132005. Within the \nnon-oil sector, construction and services have been the most dynamic. Their combined share in \nGDP and total employment has increased to 65% and 60% (footnote 2). \n \n10.  In contrast, the share of manufacturing and agriculture in GDP has declined, reflecting \nlow capital investment. The investment rate stood at 3% of GDP a year on average during the \nperiod, with half of that from the public sector. If the investment rate in the non-oil sector keeps \nto its recent trend, non-oil growth could remain at 7%\u20138% a year in the medium term\u2014and even \nhigher if the Government manages to diversify the economy and stimulate the private sector. \nRemoving impediments to regional trade and accession to the World Trade Organization would \nadvance development of both the non-oil and private sectors (footnote 2). \n \n                                                 \n3  The National Fund of Kazakhstan was created in 2001 to accumulate a part of the Government\u2019s oil and mineral \nrevenues for stabilization purposes and to save for future generations. ", "12  Appendix 1   \n11.  Continuing growth, job creation in the private sector, and pro-poor growth have raised \nliving standards. In 2004, real per capita incomes rose by 13%. The percentage of people living \nbelow the subsistence minimum4 fell from 19.8% in 2003 to 15.0% in 2004. Unemployment \ndeclined from 8.8% in 2003 to 8.4% in 2004.  \n \nB.  Political and Regional Background \n \n12.  Kazakhstan  became  an  independent  sovereign  state  in  1991  as  a  result  of  the \ndissolution of the former Soviet Union. Since then, Kazakhstan has experienced significant \nchange as it emerged from a single party political system and a centrally controlled command \neconomy to a market-oriented, democratic model. The transition was initially marked by political \nuncertainty and tension, a recessionary economy marked by high inflation and instability of the \nlocal currency, and rapid but incomplete changes in the legal environment. \n \n13.  Since 1992, Kazakhstan has actively pursued a program of economic reform designed \nto establish a free-market economy through privatization of state enterprises and deregulation; it \nis  more  advanced  in  this  respect  than  some  other  countries  of  the  Commonwealth  of \nIndependent States. However, as with any transition economy, no assurance can be given that \nsuch reforms and other reforms described elsewhere in this proposal will continue or that such \nreforms will achieve all or any of their intended aims. \n \n14.  Kazakhstan depends on neighboring states to access world markets for a number of its \nmajor exports, including oil, steel, copper, ferro-alloys, iron ore, aluminum, coal, lead, zinc, and \nwheat. Kazakhstan is thus dependent upon good relations with its neighbors to ensure its ability \nto export. In addition to taking various steps to promote regional economic integration among \nneighboring  countries,  Kazakhstan  signed  an  agreement  in  September  2003  with  Belarus, \nRussian Federation, and Ukraine to create a single economic zone, which is expected to result \nin common economic policies, harmonization of legislation implementing such policies, and \ncreation of a single commission on trade and tariffs. The aim of the single economic zone is to \ncreate a free customs area within which member countries would enjoy free movement of \ngoods, services, capital, and labor. Another step toward integration is that the member countries \nalso intend to look at ways to coordinate their fiscal policies, credit and currency policies, and \ngovernment  policies.  These  efforts  will  support  further  economic  integration  within  the \nCommonwealth of Independent States, one of the aims of which is to assure continued access \nto export routes. \n \nC.  Macroeconomic Considerations and Exchange Rate Policies \n \n15.  Since Kazakhstan is heavily dependent upon export trade and commodity prices, it was \nparticularly affected by the Asian financial crisis in early 1998 and by the Russian crisis later that \nyear,  both  of  which  exacerbated  the  problems  associated  with  falling  commodity  prices. \nBecause Kazakhstan\u2019s economy is negatively affected by low commodity prices and economic \ninstability elsewhere in the world, the Government has promoted economic reform, inward \nforeign  investment,  and  diversification  of  the  economy.  Notwithstanding  these  efforts,  low \ncommodity prices and weak demand in its export markets may adversely affect Kazakhstan\u2019s \neconomy in the future. \n                                                 \n4  The subsistence minimum is a measure of poverty. Calculated by the State Statistics Agency, it comprises the cost \nof a basket of 70% food items and 30% goods and services. The poverty line is established as a fixed percentage \nof the subsistence minimum, and it is used for determining households\u2019 social assistance allowances and eligibility \nfor such assistance. In 2004, the subsistence minimum was T5,427 or equivalent to $40 a month. ", "    Appendix 1  13\n \n16.  The  Government  began  implementing  market-based  economic  reforms  in  1992, \nincluding a significant privatization program, promotion of high levels of foreign direct investment \n(particularly in the oil and gas sectors), and introduction of an extensive legal framework. \nDespite uneven progress, Kazakhstan has experienced extensive economic transformation over \nthe  last  12  years.  Since  mid-1994,  the  Government  has  adhered  to  a  macroeconomic \nstabilization  program  aimed  at  curtailing  inflation,  reducing  the  fiscal  deficit,  and  boosting \ninternational  currency  reserves.  According  to  figures  compiled  by  Kazakhstan\u2019s  National \nStatistical Agency, GDP has continued to grow in real terms following the adoption of a floating \nexchange rate policy in April 1999. It rose by 13.5% in 2001, 9.8% in 2002, 9.2% in 2003, and \n9.4% in 2004. However, no assurance can be given that GDP will continue to grow, and any \ndecrease in GDP or in the rate of GDP growth in subsequent years could adversely affect \nKazakhstan\u2019s development. \n \n17.  The  tenge  is  convertible  for  current  account  transactions,  although  it  is  not  a  fully \nconvertible currency outside Kazakhstan. Between 1991, when Kazakhstan began its transition \nto a market-based economy, and April 1999, NBK maintained a managed exchange rate policy, \nwhich, although permitting the general trend in the exchange rate to reflect market conditions, \ninvolved official intervention aimed at limiting fluctuations. Depressed export markets in 1998 \nand early 1999 caused considerable pressure on Kazakhstan\u2019s managed exchange rate, and \nresulting official intervention in the foreign exchange markets led to losses on foreign currency \nreserves. In response to these pressures, the authorities instituted a number of expenditure \ncuts, took revenue-increasing measures, and in April 1999, NBK floated the tenge. The tenge \nfell by 64.6% against the dollar as of 31 December 1999, compared to a depreciation of 10.7% \nas of 31 December 1998. Following the adoption of a floating exchange rate policy in 1999, the \ntenge continued to depreciate against the dollar, although at a much slower rate. It depreciated \nby 4.6% in 2000, 3.8% in 2001, and 3.3% in 2002. The tenge subsequently appreciated against \nthe dollar by 7.3% during 2003 and 9.9% during 2004. Then during the first 6 months of 2005, it \ndepreciated against the dollar by 4.0%, to T135.26 as of 30 June 2005. Since then the tenge \nhas gradually appreciated against the dollar and as of 11 May 2006, NBK reported the official \nT/$ exchange rate as T122.87/$1. \n \n18.  While NBK has stated that it has no plans to resume a managed exchange rate policy, \nany  subsequent  decision  to  support  the  exchange  rate  could  have  an  adverse  impact  on \nKazakhstan\u2019s public finances and economy. \n \nD.  Monetary Policy \n \n19.  NBK maintains a managed floating currency regime and does not set any official targets \nfor the tenge exchange rate. It uses interventions on the foreign exchange market as one of the \ntools to manage systemic liquidity. Monetary policy implementation is complicated by strong \nprivate capital inflows, rising oil earnings, and buoyant domestic demand. M3 rose 49.2% per \nannum on average during 2000\u20132004, and was up a further 50.2% in 2005. Cash in circulation \nexpanded 34% per annum on average during 2000\u20132004, and increased another 35% in 2005. \nThe big build-up of money in the National Reserve Fund ($8.2 billion, or 14.4% of GDP as of \nend-February 2006), along with selling short-term notes and deposits, has assisted partial \nsterilization  of  the  domestic  liquidity  produced  by  NBK  interventions.  Nevertheless,  the \nauthorities are worried about the rise in monetary pressure on the overall inflation process. With \nno formal target, the Government aims to keep annual inflation in the 5%\u20137% range during \n2006\u20132008  to  ensure  a  stable  macroeconomic  environment,  while  in  February  2006  the \nconsumer price index increased to 8.7%. During the next 2 years, stronger social spending ", "14  Appendix 1   \nalong with further tax cuts will continue to put upward pressure on disposable income growth \nand consequently prices. Market observers therefore expect that with some easing of the tight \nfiscal stance, greater exchange rate flexibility will be allowed to keep inflation in check. NBK \nmight allow the tenge to appreciate in 2006-07 to restrain further price expansion. \n \nE.  Regulation of the Banking Industry \n \n20.  In September 1995, NBK introduced strict prudential requirements for the operation and \ncapital adequacy of banks. In addition, an institutional development plan was prepared for \nleading Kazakhstan banks. According to the plan, banks are required to prepare their accounts \nin  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  and  to  apply  the  Basel \nCommittee  norms  within  the  period  determined  by  NBK  on  a  case-to-case  basis.  Further, \nKazakhstan banks are required to join a bank-funded deposit insurance scheme and be audited \nannually by a public accountancy firm approved by NBK, which is likely to be one of the leading \ninternational  firms.  Following  legislative  changes  in  July  2003,  the  Financial  Markets \nSupervisory Agency was formed, and as of 1 January 2004, it took responsibility for most of the \nsupervisory  and  regulatory  functions  in  the  financial  sector,  which  had  previously  been \nperformed by NBK. The agency\u2019s main task is to regulate and supervise the financial markets \nand financial institutions in Kazakhstan. \n \nE.  Implementation of Market-Based Economic Reforms \n \n21.  The need for substantial investment in many enterprises has driven the Government\u2019s \nprivatization  program.  The  program  has  excluded  certain  enterprises  deemed  strategically \nsignificant by the Government, although major privatizations in key sectors have taken place, \nsuch as full or partial sales of certain large oil and gas producers, mining companies, and the \nnational telecommunication company. However, a need remains for substantial investment in \nmany sectors of the Kazakhstan economy and in some areas economic performance in the \nprivate sector is still constrained by inadequate business infrastructure. Furthermore, the extent \nof noncash transactions in the economy and the size of the shadow economy adversely affect \nimplementation of reforms and hamper the efficient collection of taxes. The Government has \nstated that it intends to address these problems by improving bankruptcy procedures, business \ninfrastructure,  and  tax  administration;  as  well  as  by  continuing  the  privatization  process. \nImplementation of these measures in the short term has produced few positive results, and \nimproved results may not materialize until the medium term, if at all. \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 2  15\nBANKING AND CAPITAL MARKETS IN KAZAKHSTAN \n \n1.  Encouraged by the improving macroeconomic environment and robust growth, Kazakh \nbanks have increased lending volumes by an average of more than 40% per year in the last 5 \nyears (albeit from a very low base), while generally maintaining healthy asset quality and \nprofitability. This is especially true for the top performers within the first two tiers of the banking \nsystem. Market observers expect this pace of growth to be sustained throughout 2006. While \nfocusing mainly on the domestic market, some Kazakh banks are increasingly expanding their \noperations in other regional Commonwealth of Independent States countries, including Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Russian Federation, and Ukraine, in order to expand and diversify their businesses \nand market exposure. \n \nA.  Overview of the Kazakh Banking Market \n2.  The commercial banks in Kazakhstan can be divided into four groups: (i) large local \nbanks  (tier  I  banks), 1  such  as  Bank  TuranAlem  JSC  and  its  principal  competitors, \nKazkommertsbank and Halyk Bank; (ii) banks under foreign ownership, such as ABN AMRO \nBank Kazakhstan, HSBC Bank Kazakhstan, and Citibank Kazakhstan; (iii) second tier (tier II \nbanks)  medium-sized  banks  with  regional  operations;  and  (iv)  smaller  local  banks.  The \ndecrease in the number of banks from 184 in 1996 to the current 342 is primarily attributable to \nthe ongoing sector reform undertaken by the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK).  \n \n3.  Three  dominant  banks\u2014Bank  TuranAlem,  Halyk  Bank,  and  Kazkommertsbank\u2014\ncollectively represented 55.8% of total system assets and 50.7% of capital, as of 30 June 2006. \nEstablished in 1990, Kazkommertsbank is the country\u2019s largest bank in terms of assets and \nsecond largest as measured by shareholders\u2019 equity. It had total assets of $9.85 billion and \ncapital of $734.8 million as of 30 June 2006. Bank TuranAlem is the second largest bank in \nterms of assets ($9.68 billion) and the leading bank in terms of capital ($1.03 billion). Halyk \nBank is the third largest bank in terms of assets\u2014approximately $6.44 billion. In the past few \nyears, however, the tier II banks have been increasingly taking more market share from the tier I \nbanks. In particular, the big three banks\u2019 collective market share declined from 62.3% in 2003 to \n55.8% as of 30 June 2006. This trend is expected to continue into the coming years.  \n \n4.  Banking reform began in 1996 with the introduction of international prudential standards, \nincluding requirements on capital adequacy, liquidity ratios, transparency as to the auditing of \nbanks  by  local  and  international  auditors,  harmonization  of  local  accounting  practices  to \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards, and personnel training programs. In addition, NBK \nrequired commercial banks to adopt recapitalization and corporate enhancement plans with the \naim of boosting their abilities to attract long-term, private investors. In 2000, guidelines were \nestablished for bank inspections and for periodic reporting by commercial banks to NBK (and \nnow  also  to  the  Financial  Markets  Supervisory  Agency,  which  currently  is  the  banking \nsupervision body in Kazakhstan). In 2003, all banks were requested to develop and install \ninternal risk management systems. \n  \n5.  According to published financial statements, the total assets of the banking system \nincreased by 60% in 2004 and 68% in 2005, and as of 30 June 2006 amounted to $46.52 billion. \n                                                 \n1  Technically, NBK would be the first tier. The terminology used here therefore only refers to commercial banks \nbelow NBK. \n2  As of August 2005, 34 banks were operating in Kazakhstan, excluding NBK, including two fully state-owned \nspecial-purpose  banks  and  14  banks  under  foreign  ownership.  As  of  mid-2004,  27  foreign  banks  had \nrepresentative offices in the country. ", " 16  Appendix 2   \nDuring the same period, the total capital of the banking system increased by 46% in 2004 and \n63% in 2005, and as of 30 June 2006 amounted to approximately $4.6 billion (Table A2.1 and \nAppendix 3 provide details). \n \nTable A2.1: Structure of Banking Aggregate Liabilities  \n(as of 1 January 2006) \n     \n  Amount   \nLiability  (T billion)  % of Total  \nClient deposits  2,533  62.2 \nInterbank deposits  185  4.5 \nLoans from the Government  3  0.1 \nLoan from international financial organizations  27  0.7 \nLoans from other banks and organizations performing  577  14.2 \ncertain types of banking operations \nREPO transactions with securities  164  4.0 \nSubordinated debt  185  4.5 \nOutstanding securities  273  6.7 \nOther creditors  128  3.1 \n  Total  4,073  100.0 \nREPO = repossessed. \nSource: Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on Regulation and Supervision of Financial Market and \nFinancial Organizations. \n \nB.  Credit Standing of Commercial Banks \n11.  The financial standings of Kazakhstan\u2019s banks vary. As of 30 September 2005, 18 of the \n34 commercial banks had registered capital of over T2 billion, 15 banks had registered capital of \nover T2 billion, 15 banks had share capital of T1 billion to T2 billion, and one bank had \nregistered capital of T500 million to T1 billion. No banks have registered capital of less than \nT500  million,  and  any  bank  whose  capital  falls  below  this  level  is  required  to  submit  an \napplication for voluntary reorganization into an entity performing only limited banking operations \nto the Financial Markets Supervisory Agency. As of 30 September 2005, aggregate provisions \nof Kazakh banks on overdue receivables were T52.5 billion. \n \n7.  As of 31 December 2005, all of the commercial banks licensed in Kazakhstan were in \ncompliance with prudential regulatory requirements on capital adequacy, single borrower limits, \nliquidity ratios, foreign currency limits, and reserve requirements. As of 31 December 2004, two \ncommercial  banks  had  failed  to  comply  with  seven  prudential  regulatory  requirements, \ncompared to one noncompliant bank as of 31 December 2003 and one as of 31 December 2002 \n(Alliance Bank was not among these banks). The noncompliant banks did not meet any of the \ncurrent liquidity ratios, own capital ratios, single borrower exposure ratio, open currency position \nratio, and maximum asset investment ratio. Provisions for bad debts of all banks operating in \nthe Kazakhstan banking subsector as of 31 August 2005 totaled T52.5 billion. \n \nC.  Access to Funds \n8.  Total liabilities of the banking system increased by 68.4% to T4,073 billion as of 1 \nJanuary 2006 (Table A2.1). The most significant impact was on client deposits, which increased \nby 56.5% to T2,533 billion and accounted for 62.2% of aggregate banking system liabilities. The \nincrease was attributed to a combination of economic growth and rise in population income. \n \n ", "    Appendix 2  17\n9.  The  lack  of  a  well-functioning  domestic  interbank  market  continues  to  hamper  the \nliquidity management of banks. Interbank deposits only account for 4.5% of the aggregate \nbanking system\u2019s liabilities. The banks are therefore turning to the international debt capital \nmarkets for funding enabled by the improving country rating. Access to the international loan \nmarkets by medium-sized banks has also improved. Several banks were able to raise financing \nfrom the international loan market. \n \nD.  Overview of Kazakh Capital Markets \n \n9.  Three types of government securities are available: T-bills, T-bonds, and inflation-linked \nbonds and variable bonds. Currently, only one T-bill is outstanding; it will mature on 30 March \n2006. Nineteen T-bonds are outstanding; they are typically 3\u20135 year debt, with the longest fixed-\nrate bond maturing in May 2010. The amount outstanding currently stands at T56 billion, or \n$430 million; the coupons are paid semiannually. The five consumer price index-linked bonds \nare valued at T 15 billion ($115 million). The latest consumer price index-linked bond was \nissued in April 2005, has the largest outstanding amount (T14 billion, or $110 million), and \nmatures in 2015. Due to the high oil revenues and a cautious fiscal stance, the Government \ndoes not need to borrow in the local debt market. Due to the growth of the pension fund system \nin Kazakhstan, the country has a serious shortage of good domestic long-term investment \nassets for these funds. The country\u2019s bond market is therefore very illiquid, as most of the \noutstanding issues are held by the local pension funds. \n \n7.  Turnover at the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange increased by 37% in 2005 (Table A2.2). \nHowever,  exchange  turnover  growth  has  been  concentrated  on  repurchase  transactions, \nprimarily on government securities. Turnover of the corporate sector only accounted for around \n3.4% of total turnover in 2005. The most active participants in the exchange (i.e. buying and \nselling securities) are the banks, such as Bank TuranAlem, Kazkommertsbank, ATF Bank, \nEurasian Bank, and Alliance Bank. \n \nTable A2.2: Comparative Data on Kazakhstan Stock Exchange Turnover  \n($ million) \n \n          YTD  June \n  2004  2004 %  2005  2005 %  June  2006 % \nMarket Sector  Volume  of Total  Volume  of Total  2006  of Total \nForeign Exchange  9,449 16.1 12,044 15.0 12,687  22.1\nGovernment Securities  5,558 9.4 4,754 5.9 2,189  3.8\nCorporate Shares  977 1.7 1,040 1.3 800  1.4\nCorporate Bonds  853 1.4 1,715 2.1 1,800  3.1\nRepurchasea  42,012 71.4 60,848 75.7 39,854  69.5\n  Total  58,850 100.0 80,403 100.0 57,331  100.0\nYTD = year-to-date. \na Corporate and government securities. \nNote: Only deals of the primary market and purchase-sale deals on the secondary market, including state blocks of \nshares are considered in the sector of equities and corporate bonds.

Market capitalization of the stock market increased from $3.94 billion in 2004 to $10.52 \nbillion in 2005, and was $30.56 billion as of June 2006. The increase in market capitalization \nwas partly explained by the growth in the number of listed companies from 84 at year-end 2005 \nto 107 in June 2006. Liquidity, however, remains a concern where corporate share turnover only ", " 18  Appendix 2   \naccounted for 1.3% of total exchange turnover in 2005 (Table A2.2). Domestic companies still \nfear the loss of control that would result from having institutional minority shareholders, while the \ninstitutional investors are concerned about insufficient protection of their minority interests. This \naccounted for the underdeveloped status of the stock market.  \n \n9.  The corporate debt securities market of the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange is represented \nby 176 bond issues including 2 issues by nonresidents (JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch) as of June \n2006. The financial sector remains the leader in terms of debt issuance. The debt securities \nmarket capitalization is estimated at $10.4 billion, which is 63% higher than in 2005. It is \ncharacterized  by  a  large  volume  of  consumer  price  index-linked  bonds  due  to  increasing \ninflation and an overall yield increase due to the rise in inflation and instruments supply.   \n \n10.  Domestic pension funds have increasingly emerged as important investors in the local \nbond market since the launch of pension reform in 1998. The steadily accumulating pension \nfunds provide a supply of long-term funds that is lacking in most emerging markets, including \nmany other former Central Asian and Commonwealth of Independent States countries. In the \ncase of pension fund assets, these are heavily concentrated from a portfolio management \nperspective.  NBK  bills  and  corporate  bonds  account  for  34%  and  26%  of  total  assets, \nGovernment  bonds,  including  municipal  bonds,  account  for  19%  and  are  declining  as  the \nGovernment seeks to reduce its domestic burden.

Background \n1.  Securitization is a form of financing that involves the pooling of financial assets and the \nissuance of securities that are repaid from the cash flows generated by these assets. This is \ngenerally accomplished by a true sale of the assets to a bankruptcy remote vehicle, which \nfinances the purchase through the issuance of bonds backed by the future cash flows of the \nasset pool. This achieves the outcome of creating a class of securities for which the underlying \nrisk is independent from that of the originating institution, and generally of a higher credit quality. \n \n2.  Securitization gained popularity as an asset class in the mid-1980s. By late 2004, it had \ngrown to represent 31% of the $23 trillion United States bond market, with home mortgages \nrepresenting the majority of the securitized assets. Although securitization in Europe took longer \nto establish, securitization issuance increased from $50 billion to $500 billion between 1998 and \n2003. \n \n3.  In  the  emerging  markets,  securitization  has  been  growing  quickly.  Initially,  most \ntransactions involved the securitization of future offshore cash flows derived from exports and \nremittances. Such structures, generally referred to as future flow transactions, are driven by the \nneed  for  borrowers  to  raise  relatively  cheap  cross-border  financing.  This  is  achieved  by \nmitigating  the  currency  transfer  risk  that  would  otherwise  be  present  in  their  corporate \nborrowings. More recently, as many developing countries have begun adopting the legal and \nregulatory reforms necessary for the domestic issuance of securitization, the bulk of activity has \nshifted to local markets. Although future flow transactions do play a role in local markets, the \nsecuritization of existing assets has seen the largest growth. \n \n4.  Securitization  is  most  appropriate  for  a  company  that  is  seeking  balance  sheet \nmanagement, or a company with a specific pool of assets that is better than its overall credit \nquality. In principle, any assets pool with predictable cash flows can be securitized, even those \nthat are nonperforming, as long as the timing and amount of recovery is predictable. The most \ncommon assets for securitization include mortgages, credit cards, auto and consumer loans, \ncorporate debt, export receivables, and offshore remittances. \n \nB.  Structure \n \n5.  At  the  center  of  a  securitization  is a  special purpose  vehicle  (SPV)  set  up  by  the \noriginator of the financial assets to be securitized. The SPV is purchasing the financial asset \nreceivables (mortgages, SME loans, etc.) from the originator. The SPV will be structured to \ncontrol its income and expenses so that it will be \u201cbankruptcy remote.\u201d1 The SPV will fund the \npurchase of the receivables through the issue of debt securities to investors, which will be \nsecured on the receivables by virtue of a security interest granted to a security trustee acting for \nthe investors and other creditors. The originator (or an associated company) may continue to \nact as the servicer in collecting and administering the receivables as an agent of the SPV, which \nin turn will apply the income from the receivables to make payment of principal and interest \n                                                 \n1  A key concern in securitization transactions is to ensure that the transfer of assets of the originator to the SPV is \nnot affected by bankruptcy or distress of the originator. This necessitates certain legal precautions in structuring the \nassignment of receivables, and also constituting the SPV that it can neither be taken to liquidation by the \nshareholders of the originator, nor by those of the SPV itself. Further, the structure should also ensure that the SPV \nwould not be treated as the subset of the originator by substantive consolidation. Such a structure is called \nbankruptcy remote structure. ", "  Appendix 4  21\nunder the debt securities as well as transaction expenses. A standby servicer may also be \narranged in case the originator fails to perform its servicing obligations. Funds received by the \nSPV in excess of those required to pay investors are generally channeled back to the originator. \nThus, securitization enables nontradable assets that range in marketability, credit-worthiness, \nand size to become liquid secondary instruments through repackaging and cash-flow structuring.  \n6.  To obtain the lowest all-in cost of financing for the asset originator, the risk inherent in \nthe asset pool is often structured to create two or more layers of risk. These layers are often \nreferred to as tranches. Typically, the expected loss on the portfolio is identified and placed in a \njunior (also referred to as equity) tranche that is retained by the originator. Requiring the \noriginator  to  fully  absorb  the  initial  losses  helps  to  mitigate  the  moral  hazard  that  would \notherwise be present if one entity were to originate the portfolio, but not have a stake in its \neventual performance. \n \n7.  The next tranche of risk is often referred to as mezzanine, which is generally structured \nto  absorb  losses  that  are  not  necessarily  expected,  but  that  may  reasonably  occur  if \nperformance  of  the  portfolio  is  much  worse  than  anticipated.  With  the  proper  amount  of \nsubordination, derived from the junior and mezzanine tranches, a highly rated senior tranche \ncan then be structured that is generally deemed to comprise relatively little risk. If adequately \nstructured,  this  senior  tranche  achieves  a  risk-reward  combination  sufficient  to  attract \ninstitutional investors. \n \n8.  Various forms of credit and liquidity enhancement will be used and structured into the \ntransaction cash flow to ensure that payments on the debt securities issued to the investors are \nmade in full and on a timely basis. Consequently, the recourse of the investors is usually limited \nto (i) receivables, (ii) transaction cash flow, and (iii) credit enhancement incorporated in the \nsecuritization structure. A high credit rating (usually higher than that of the originator) on the \ndebt securities and therefore cheaper funding can be obtained by reason of the quality of the \nreceivables, the isolation of the receivables from the other risks of the originator\u2019s business (by \narranging a \u201ctrue\u201d sale of the receivables from the originator to the SPV) and the arrangements \nfor credit enhancement and liquidity support.  \n \n ", "22  Appendix 5 \nBENEFITS OF SECURITIZATION1 \nA.  How Originators Benefit \n1.  Originators (the selling bank) gain from securitization by obtaining many of the benefits \nof high-credit quality financing without retaining the debt on their books and without forgoing \nprofitable aspects of the assets, including origination, servicing, expansion of business, and \nretention of excess spread. The technique for determining the price paid can be complex and \nmay require a significant initial investment of managerial and financial resources. Some relevant \nadvantages include the following: \n \n(i)  Assets  removed  from  the  balance  sheet.  If  structured  as  a  true  sale, \nsecuritization can allow the originator to reduce its assets and debt, thereby \nincreasing its scope for borrowing. Securitization allows a bank or business to \nachieve greater leverage. \n \n(ii)  Lower financing costs. Well-regarded pools of assets owned by a company or \nbank can be used to structure a security of higher credit quality, and therefore, of \nlower market cost than the corporate entity could issue itself. \n \n(iii)  Reduction  in  required  capital.  For  a  bank  or  finance  company  that  faces \nregulatory capital requirements, a securitization transaction that qualifies as a \nsale  of  assets  for  bank  regulatory  purposes  reduces  the  need  for  equity \nfinancing. The latter may be costly and hard to obtain, and may dilute control. \n \n(iv)  Recognition  of  gains  (or  losses).  Depending  on  accounting  rules,  a \nsecuritization structured as a sale of assets may allow a seller to recognize an \naccounting gain (or loss) equal in the aggregate to the present value of any \nexpected future cash flows payable to the seller that will be derived from the \nassets. \n \n(v)  Access to an alternative source of finance and class of investors. \n \nB.  How Investors Benefit  \n2.  Asset-backed securities are not suitable for all investors: they are more complex, and \nthey may be less liquid than other debt securities. Nevertheless, many investors find that asset-\nbacked securities open up attractive new investment opportunities for the following reasons: \n(i)  Superior return. The main benefit from the investor's viewpoint is a higher return \nor spread than is generally available on corporate or sovereign debt of a similar \nrating. \n(ii)  Liquidity.  The  securitization  structure  offers  far  greater  liquidity  than  the \nindividual loans backing the transaction. \n(iii)  Diversification.  Investors  gain  an  opportunity  to  diversify  their  portfolios  by \nparticipating in a different class of assets. \n                                                 \n1  Based on Giddy, Ian H. 2000. Asset Securitization In Asia. New York University  ", "  Appendix 5  23\n(iv)  Mitigation  of  event  risk.  Unlike  similar,  high-rated  corporate  bonds,  asset-\nbacked securities are largely immune from event risk. The latter results from \ntakeovers, restructurings, and other events that effectively alter the credit status \nof senior unsecured corporate obligations. \n(v)  Coping  with  constraints.  Many  institutional  investors  are  constrained  to \npurchase  only  investment  grade  securities,  and  some  are  limited  to  triple-A \npaper. Both requirements can be met in the securitization market.  \n \nC.  How the National Economy Benefits \n3.  The effect of securitization on the economies of different countries is still difficult to \nassess because the technique is in its infancy in many parts of the world. Nevertheless, in \ncountries such as Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and the United States, where a high \nproportion of residential mortgages and other claims have been securitized, the gains to the \nnational economy can be measured in the billions of dollars. In the United States alone, for \nexample, at least $1,600 billion of mortgage- and asset-backed securities are outstanding. \nAccording to a conservative estimate, securitization in the United States reduces the annual \ncost ($1,600 billion) of financing for homeowners and others by 0.5%, freeing up $8 billion of \nresources each year.  \n \n4.  But the case for securitization is actually even stronger than this. Asset securitization, if \nintroduced in a transparent and orderly fashion, offers Asian countries additional gains from \n \n(i)  capital market development, as more high-quality securities are added to the \nfixed-income market; \n(ii)  a  source  of  funds  for  rapidly  growing,  capital-constrained  banks,  finance \ncompanies,  and  industrial  companies  whose  expansion  depends  on  the \nextension of credit to their customers; \n(iii)  an expanded source of financing for residential home ownership and other asset \nclasses; and \n(iv)  the potential for financing infrastructure projects and other assets that produce \nreliable revenue streams capable of being contractually assigned to a separate \nlegal entity. \n \n ", "24  Appendix 6 \nTHE MECHANICS OF FUTURE FLOW SECURITIZATION  \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The types of assets securitized by future flow securitizations have varied over the years. \nThe most common flow being securitized previously stemmed from export receivables. Over the \npast 15 years and through 2005, approximately $54.2 billion in future flow export receivables \ntransactions have occurred. Since 2002, financial remittances have become the most popular \nfuture  flow  asset  class,  with  $13.2  billion  of  remittances/diversified  payment  right  (DPR) \nsecuritizations.  \n \nB.  Historical Volume Development \n \n2.  Latin America has traditionally been the strongest originator of future flow receivables. \nIssuers such as Mexico\u2019s Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos (Pemex), which in 1996 placed $6.0 billion, and \nVenezuela\u2019s PDVSA Finance Ltd placement of $3.4 billion have enhanced Latin America\u2019s \nvolume over the years. Until 2001, Mexico had always been the dominating country for future \nflow issuance. Prior to the upsurge in volume in Turkey in 2005, Brazil had taken over as the \nprimary source for future flow paper. This is mainly due to the countries\u2019 sovereign ratings. \nMexican issuers, because they are domiciled in an investment-grade country, are less in need \nof the structural protections provided by future flow. Brazil (and Turkey in 2005) on the other \nhand, which has been rated between B and BB since 2001, is a market where future flow is \nuseful in mitigating sovereign-related risks and opens access to international capital markets for \nstrong companies.  \n \n3.  While  Mexico,  Brazil,  and  Turkey  could  be  considered  the  historical  leaders,  other \ncountries have also had significant amounts of issuance. Argentina has produced more than \n$3.5 billion, although amounts have been limited since the 2001 financial crisis. Top banks from \nvarious Central American countries issued financial remittance future flows. Recently, Indonesia \nreturned  to  the  future  flow  market  with  $600  million  securitization of  coal  exports.  Finally, \nEastern Europe and the Russian Federation have shown significant potential for strong future \nflow candidates. \n \nC.  Transaction Mechanics \n \n4.  A future flow transaction securitizes the cash flow originating from a specific business \nline of a bank or company that produces goods or services for foreign customers. The structure \nof the future flow transaction is designed to collect cash flows in a dedicated offshore collection \naccount. The cash flows come from a variety of sources, including foreign importers making \npayments on receivables, international credit card companies making settlement payments to \nlocal banks, and international banks making remittance transfers to local banks. All cash flows \npass  through  the  offshore  collection  account,  and  the  excess  flows  are  returned  to  the \noriginating entity only after periodic debt-service payments are made.  \n \n5.  The transaction\u2019s structure mitigates many sovereign risks by keeping the cash flow \noffshore until the investors are paid. If certain events occur (trigger events), the structures \ntypically trap all cash flows going through the collection account to accelerate amortization of \nthe notes. In some cases, only a portion of excess flows are captured during early amortization \nevents in order to avert a liquidity crisis for an issuer. Ratings of future flow transactions are tied \nto the credit quality of the originator, which is typically measured by its local currency issuer \ndefault rating.  ", "  Appendix 6  25\n6.  In some cases, a transaction\u2019s issuer default rating may be higher than the company\u2019s \nlocal currency issuer default rating thanks to the company\u2019s ability to continue operating beyond \na general default and generate receivables for the duration of the deal. The going concern \nassessment (Fitch methodology) and survivability assessment (Moody\u2019s) address these issues. \nAchieving a rating at this level is a twofold concept. The company must not only continue to \ngenerate these receivables by producing and delivering the product, but the collections from the \nreceivables  must  also  be  legally  protected  through  a  true  sale  structure.  In  some  cases, \ntransactions are rated above the issuing company\u2019s local currency issuer default rating but \nbelow the going concern/survivability level.  \n \n \nFigure A6: Typical Future Flow Transaction Structure \n \nReceivables \nPayment \n  Obligors  Trust \n \nPrincipal and \n  Interest \nFuture  Future \nProdu ct  Receivables \nInvestors \nCollections over \nPrincipal and \n \nInterest  Offshore \n  Local Country \nOriginator \n \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank analysis. \n \n \nD.  Future Flow Asset Classes \n7.  The two general types of future flow securitizations are (i) financial future flows backed \nby banks\u2019 generation of hard currency flows, and (ii) corporate-related transactions typically \ninvolving export receipts of some description. Financial flows include credit card vouchers, \nelectronic  (typically  SWIFT-related  payments,1 including  MT100s  and  MT200s2)  and  paper \nremittances. Corporate-related transactions typically involve airline ticket receivables; telephone \nnet settlements; and the most prevalent, export receivables transactions, which are backed by \nproducts such as oil, gas, steel, iron ore, soybean, paper and pulp, aluminum, coffee, and \nchemicals.  \n                                                 \n1  Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) is an international messaging system \nowned and maintained by the member banks (payment order only, no settlement). MT103/103+ are sent by the \nordering customer\u2019s bank to the beneficiary\u2019s bank and are used to convey a funds transfer instruction. \n2   MT100 (including MT102, 103) is the standard message type for payment orders relating to payment from senders \nto payees who are individuals, companies (other than financial institutions), or governments through banks. MT \n200 (including MT202) is the standard message type for payment orders relating to payment from senders to \npayees that are financial institutions. \n \n ", "26  Appendix 6 \n8.  A  bank  or  company  based  in  an  emerging  market  securitizes  existing  and  future \nreceivables related to offshore cash flows (usually in a stable foreign currency) and receives the \nproceeds of the debt issuance denominated in the same currency. The cash flows originate \nfrom a specific line of business in which the bank/company has demonstrated consistent strong \nperformance and is expected to continue for the foreseeable future, or at least for the life of the \nstructured deal. In the majority of structures, the bank/company sells its rights to the future flow \nto an offshore special purpose vehicle, which transfers its rights to an offshore trust. The trust \nissues debt securities backed by future cash flows, and remits the sale proceeds to the special \npurpose vehicle, which in turn passes them back to the originating bank/company.  \n9.  Because note holders have access to payments on the receivables before they return to \nthe country in which the issuer is located, they are not believed to be directly subject to \nconvertibility  and  transfer  risks.  Thus,  the  ratings  of  these  transactions  are  not  strictly \nconstrained by the foreign currency rating of the host country (the sovereign ceiling). However, \nall sovereign risks are not mitigated by the structure, and transaction ratings are still constrained \nby certain inherent political and economic risks of an emerging-market country. These risks can \narise from such events as government instability, civil unrest, or natural disaster.

The bank that wishes to raise funds sells its rights to all present and future diversified \npayment rights (DPRs) to an offshore special purpose vehicle (SPV). The SPV transfers its \nrights to the cash flows to an offshore trust, and then issues debt securities (notes) backed by \nthe future cash flows. The sale proceeds from the notes are then transferred from the SPV to \nthe originating bank.  \n \n2.  The cash flows sold are typically only those payments received from correspondent \nbanks  located  in  highly  rated  countries  such  as  Europe  and  the  United  States.  The \ncorrespondent banks sign a notice and acknowledgment that commits them to sending all future \nreceivables to a trust account held by the SPV. This cash flow is then used to make scheduled \nprincipal and interest payments to the notes investors; any excess cash is returned to the \noriginator. Appendix 8 provides a graphic illustration of a DPR securitization. \n \n3.  DPR securitization is recognized as an alternative source of long-term capital for banks. \nThe cost of funds is attractive compared to unsecured bonds. The notes usually receive a rating \nhigher than the host country\u2019s foreign currency sovereign rating since (i) the future receivables \nare due from offshore obligors, and (ii) the repayment is made directly by the SPV, which again \nis located offshore, to the investor. The investment grade rating makes these transactions \nattractive to a wider range of investors such as insurance companies that face limitations on \nbuying subinvestment grade. The sold receivables also form part of the assets of the SPV and \ntherefore, are not subject to claim of any other creditor in the event of bankruptcy. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20061027115720+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20061026161259+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - RRP DPR Securitization of Alliance Bank Main ABBREVIATED.doc", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "RMD", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}, "author_page": " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 9 August 2006) \n \nCurrency Unit \u2013  tenge (T) \n \nT1.00 =  $0.0082  \n$1.00 =  T122.56 \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \nADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \nALB  \u2013  Alliance Bank JSC \nCIS  \u2013  Commonwealth of Independent States \nDDB  \u2013  designated depository bank \nDPR  \u2013  diversified payment rights \nDSCR  \u2013  debt service coverage ratio  \nGDP  \u2013  gross domestic product \nJSC  \u2013  joint stock company \nKfW  \u2013  Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau \nNBK  \u2013  National Bank of Kazakhstan \nPRC  \u2013  People\u2019s Republic of China \nPSOD  \u2013  Private Sector Operations Department \nSMEs  \u2013  small- and medium-sized enterprises \nSPV  \u2013  special purpose vehicle \nSWIFT  \u2013  Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications \nUS  \u2013  United States  \n \nNOTE \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n   \nVice President  L.
