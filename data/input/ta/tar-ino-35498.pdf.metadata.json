The Government of Indonesia has requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance \nfor  the  implementation  of  an  anti-money  laundering  law,  to  be  enacted  shortly,  and  the \ndevelopment  of  an  anti-money  laundering  regime.  At  the  Consultative  Group  on  Indonesia1 \nquarterly  meeting  held  on  20  February  2002,  the  Government  stated  its  commitment  to \nmacrostability and advancing needed reforms including structures inhibiting money laundering. \nStrengthening existing institutions\u2019 capabilities, the development of newly established institutions \nand systems for monitoring suspicious transactions, and training of officials will be key. This \ntechnical assistance (TA) will improve financial governance, promote the soundness and stability \nof Indonesia\u2019s financial system, and help protect an integrated global financial system that could \nbe undermined through money laundering activities. Money laundering also makes countries \nvulnerable to other kinds of crimes such as drug trafficking, trafficking in people, fraud, and \ncorruption. This vulnerability leads to poor governance and undermines state institutions and their \nlegitimacy, thereby posing a serious threat to sound economic development.  \n \n2.  ADB  is  an  Observer  International  Organization  of  the  Asia/Pacific  Group  on  Money \nLaundering  (APG),2  the  leading  forum  in  the  region,  and  has  supported  and  contributed  to \nregional efforts against money laundering. Anti-money laundering issues are strategic to ADB \nreform  measures  in  the  context  of  its  two  key  policies  on  governance  and  anti-corruption. \nEnactment of anti-money laundering legislation is also an outstanding condition for release of the \nthird tranche and final tranche of $350 million under the Indonesia Financial Governance Reform \nSector Development Program Loan.3 \n \n3.  The development of a common regional approach for countries is important to promote \nstandard  guidelines,  definitions,  practices,  and  systems  that  can  facilitate  and  enhance  the \nidentification of cross-border money laundering transactions. ADB\u2019s regional TA for Countering \nMoney Laundering in the Asian and Pacific Region4 includes a survey to assess anti-money \nlaundering  issues  to  support  development  of  a  regional  framework  to  counter  the  practice. \nIndonesia is one of nine countries examined under this regional TA. ADB has also been assisting \nthe Government in adopting policies and procedures to mitigate the use of businesses as a \nvehicle  for  money  laundering.  The  focus  of  those  operations  has  been  to  strengthen  the \nregulators\u2019 market vigilance; improve the quality and reporting of information; and develop proper \nrules on governance, disclosure, and transparency in relation to shareholdings and beneficial \nownership. The proposed TA will link and build upon these efforts, provide immediate critical \nsupport for implementation of an anti-money laundering law, develop relevant institutions, and \nprovide capacity building and training.5  The TA framework is given in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES OR PROBLEMS \n \n4.   The United Nations targeted 2003 for all countries to have enacted appropriate national \nlegislation  to  end  money  laundering,  estimated  at  $200  billion  worldwide.  Action  at  the \n                                                           \n1   Consultative Group on Indonesia represents key funding agencies and institutions providing assistance. \n2   APG was established in 1997 and is comprised of 22 members. APG facilitates the adoption, implementation, and \nenforcement of internationally accepted anti-money laundering standards as set out in the 40 Recommendations of \nthe Financial Action Task Force (FATF). \n3   Loan 1618-INO:  Financial Governance Reforms: Sector Development \u2013 Program Loan, for $1.4 billion, approved \non 25 June 1998. \n4   TA 5967-REG: Countering Money Laundering in the Asian and Pacific Region, for $650,000, approved on \n20 December  2000.  Countries  covered  are  Cook  Islands,  Fiji  Islands,  Indonesia,  Marshall  Islands,  Nauru, \nPhilippines, Samoa, Thailand, and Vanuatu. To be completed by December 2002. \n5   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in December 2001. ", "2  \n \ninternational level to combat the practice began in 1988 with two key initiatives: (i) the Basel \nCommittee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices, which issued a Statement of \nPrinciples on money laundering controls based on (a) avoidance of suspicious transactions, \n(b) cooperation with law enforcement authorities, and (c) \u201cknow your customer\u201d rules; and (ii) the \nUnited Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, \nwhich has now been ratified by over 140 countries. The latter is the first multilateral, legally \nbinding  instrument  to  address  the  issue  of  money  laundering.  Its  provisions  encourage \ninternational cooperation to identify, trace, seize, and confiscate the proceeds of drug trafficking \nand  to  prosecute  those  responsible  for  laundering  illicit  profits.  Similarly,  the  International \nOrganization  of  Securities  Commissions  has  issued  guidance;  and  in  January  2002,  the \nInternational  Association  of  Insurance  Supervisors  issued  Anti-Money  Laundering  Guidance \nNotes for Insurance Supervisors and Insurance Entities.    \n \n5.  Indonesia\u2019s lack of anti-money laundering measures resulted in June 2001 in the Financial \nAction Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) adding the country to its list of Non-Cooperative \nCountries and Territories following the FATF assessment of its anti-money laundering regime.  \nFATF is an independent international body established by the Group of Seven Summit in 1989 \nwhose membership consists of 29 governments and 2 international organizations (the European \nCommission and the Gulf Co-operation Council). FATF also collaborates closely with APG and \nothers to extend its fight against financial crimes. FATF develops and promotes policies, both \nnationally and internationally, to combat money laundering. It has issued 40 recommendations to \nfight money laundering, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have \nrecognized the \u201cFATF 40\u201d as one of the 12 core standards for sound financial systems. FATF \nencourages self-assessment and mutual evaluation exercises to determine the compliance of \ncountries with its recommendations. At this time, Indonesia meets only nine criteria and partially \nmeets four others. Overall, Indonesia lacks a basic set of anti-money laundering provisions; core \nareas of weakness include \n \n(i)  no law recognizing money laundering as a criminal offense, \n(ii)  no  mandatory  system  of  reporting  suspicious  transactions  to  a  financial \nintelligence unit, and  \n(iii)  no customer identification regulations for nonbank financial institutions. \n \n6.  Failure to take necessary steps to remedy these identified deficiencies will result in the \nimposition of countermeasures by FATF members, which could severely impact correspondent \nbanking and other areas. To rectify the deficiencies, the Government drafted the anti-money \nlaundering law, Law Concerning Eradication of Money Laundering Criminal Acts, which was \nsubmitted to Parliament in January 2001. ADB provided detailed comments on the draft law under \nTA 5967-REG (footnote 4).  It is presently under consideration and is hoped to be approved by \nJune 2002 to avoid the imposition of countermeasures. The Ministry of Justice and Human Rights \n(MJHR) coordinated the preparation of the law and its submission to Parliament, and will prepare \nenabling regulations and coordinate the establishment of the Commission to Combat Money \nLaundering (KPTPPU) and the Center for Financial Transaction and Reporting Analysis (PPATK), \nnew institutions to be established under the new law. The Working Group on Money Laundering \nassists MJHR and includes representatives from (i) the Ministry of Finance (MOF) \uf8e7 Directorate \nGeneral of Financial Institutions (DGFI) and Badan Pengawas Pasar Modal (BAPEPAM), (ii) \nBank Indonesia (BI), (iii) the Attorney General\u2019s Office, (iv) the police, (v) Badan Pengawas \nKeuangan dan Pembangunan (BPKP), and (vi) the Ministry of Home Affairs. \n \n7.  Enactment of appropriate legislation is only the first step in establishing a foundation for \nan effective anti-money laundering regime. Critical issues and challenges remain to be addressed ", "3  \n \nin  order  to  achieve  a  working  system  to  combat  the  practice.  The  new  law  requires  the \nestablishment of a commission (KPTPPU) and a center for financial transaction and reporting \nanalysis (PPATK). However, those bodies\u2019 roles and functions must be elaborated to ensure \neffective operations; appropriate staff must be selected; significant capacity building and training \nmust be undertaken; and sufficient budget needs to be allocated to support initial operations. \n \n8.  A fundamental lack of infrastructure and systems to support the monitoring, analysis and \ninvestigation of suspicious transactions is also a critical issue. Some information technology (IT) \nrequirements for PPATK for FATF reporting have been assessed;6 however the broader IT \nrequirements for PPATK and KPTPPU have not. The current IT assessment addresses only a \nbasic core system, but does not cover IT requirements for the general administration, accounting \nand day-to-day operations of PPATK and KPTPPU; nor does it provide additional capacity for \nsophisticated  analyses  of  suspicious  transactions  submitted  to  PPATK  to  determine  those \ntransactions that should be investigated. Management information system assistance should also \nbe provided to support the system\u2019s development and implementation in relevant institutions to \nensure an effective monitoring and reporting of suspicious transactions to PPATK.  In general, the \nlarge banks are expected to have this capacity; however, in the nonbank sector and for some of \nthe  smaller  banks,  insufficient  capacity  and  systems  may  be  an  issue.  Although  reporting \ntransactions  of  Rp100,000,0007  or  more  may  be  straightforward,  detecting  patterns  of \ntransactions falling below the threshold may require sophisticated software, analyses, and skills. \nPPATK could develop basic monitoring software for distribution to covered institutions at nominal \ncost,  thus  ensuring  sufficient  standardization  across  covered  institutions.  However,  an \nassessment should be conducted to determine costs and benefits for small and medium-sized \nbanks and nonbank financial institutions to effectively implement such systems. Another core \nissue is the lack of skills base, knowledge, and institutional capacity for anti-money laundering \nactivities. Basic training on money laundering principles, trends and patterns, possible deterrent \nactions,  forensic  accounting,  auditing,  and  investigative  techniques  is  essential  for  existing \ninstitutions and for the planned PPATK and KPTPPU. The fact that there is little understanding or \neven awareness among the public and regulated entities of money laundering as a crime and its \nimpact is also an issue to be addressed. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The purpose of the proposed TA is to develop an effective anti-money laundering regime \nto increase the soundness of Indonesia\u2019s financial system, economic development, and good \ngovernance. Better controls for money laundering will add to the stability of Indonesia\u2019s financial \nsystem;  support  a  sound,  integrated  financial  system  in  a  global  economy;  and  reduce \nvulnerabilities  to  other  types  of  crimes  such  as  drug  trafficking,  trafficking  in  people,  and \ncorruption. The TA will build upon the country-specific legal analysis provided by TA 5967-REG \nand support Indonesia\u2019s integration in a regional plan for countering money laundering. This TA \nwill support the implementation of anti-money laundering law and regulations, the establishment \nof new institutions mandated by the law, and the development of monitoring and database \nsystems; increase the skills base and institutional capacity necessary for an effective anti-money \nlaundering regime; and promote public awareness and understanding of money laundering and of \nthe impact of the new law.  \n \n                                                           \n6   AusAID has prepared an assessment and budget for basic information technology requirements of PPATK. \n7   Equivalent to $9,759 based on exchange rate of $1=Rp10,247 as of 15 February 2002. ", "4  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The  proposed  TA  will  be  conducted  in  consultation  and  coordination  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s Working Group on Money Laundering. As the KPTPPU becomes operational, \nconsultation and coordination of the TA will shift to KPTPPU if the Working Group is dissolved, or \nlie with both bodies if a continuing role for the Working Group is maintained. Assistance provided \nunder this TA will also be undertaken in collaboration and consultation with APG.8  APG facilitates \nthe adoption, implementation, and enforcement of internationally accepted anti-money laundering \nstandards throughout the Asia and Pacific Region. Substantial progress has been made including \nenactment of legislation in many countries, agreement by APG members to participate in mutual \nevaluations,  better  understanding  of  and  action  against  money  laundering  methods,  and \nincreased information exchange. \n \n11.  ADB has been coordinating closely on the subject of anti-money laundering, with other \nagencies including the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), United States \nAgency for International Development (USAID), Department for International Development of the \nUnited  Kingdom,  IMF,  World  Bank,  United  Nations,  and  Asia-Europe  Meeting  Anti-Money \nLaundering Initiative (ASEM).9 Aid coordination meetings were held in Jakarta in December 2001 \nand January-February 2002. The World Bank is addressing money laundering issues through the \nintroduction of a new module in its Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). This module is \nbeing piloted in the current FSAP for Switzerland, which is underway, and Indonesia is not \nscheduled for an FSAP before 2003. IMF, in cooperation with the United Nations, Office for Drug \nControl  and  Crime  Prevention  in  Vienna,  conducted  an  assessment  in  February  2002  of \nIndonesian Government and aid agency activities to address money laundering and the potential \nrole for IMF. Although no action plan has yet been presented by IMF, the possibility of some \nshort-term TA was discussed. AusAID has been providing core short-term assistance and will \nsupport  the  Government  in  preparing  amendments  to  the  draft  law  based  on  consolidated \ncomments from funding agencies and other parties to be considered in Parliament for decision in \nMarch  2002.  USAID  indicated  that  a  small  amount  of  funds  could  be  made  available  for \nimmediate assistance to supplement AusAID\u2019s efforts. This proposed TA is presently the only \nsignificant medium-term assistance being discussed among aid agencies, and will play a critical \nrole in supporting the implementation, development, and capacity building necessary for an \neffective  anti-money  laundering  regime.  Longer-term  support  is  also  planned  under  ADB\u2019s \nproposed  Financial  Governance  and  Social  Security  Reform  Program  Loan,  for  which  a \nmemorandum of understanding was signed with the Government in February 2002. ADB will \ncontinue to coordinate closely with other donors during TA implementation. \n \n12.  This TA will (i) support implementation of the new anti-money laundering law; (ii) provide \nassistance in the establishment and development of KPTPPU and PPATK; (iii) provide a training \nneeds assessment and program for capacity building and training for key existing institutions and \nfor  KPTPPU  and  PPATK;  (iv)  assess  options  and  alternatives  for  suspicious  transactions \nmonitoring systems and a database for PPATK and systems of covered institutions, and provide \na recommended action plan with estimated budget for systems implementation; (v) develop \nguidance notes for financial institutions in the reporting of suspicious transactions; (vi) conduct \ntraining for law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and the judiciary in the enforcement of the anti-\n                                                           \n8   APG members include Australia; Bangladesh; Cook Islands; Fiji Islands; Hong Kong, China; India; Indonesia; \nJapan; Republic of Korea; Macau, China; Malaysia; New Zealand; Pakistan; Philippines; Samoa; Singapore; Sri \nLanka; Taipei,China; Thailand; United States; and Vanuatu. \n9   ASEM is a three-year initiative started in July 2001 and sponsored by the UK, EC and Dutch Government that \nfocuses on development of sustainable institutional capacity in the Asia Region and closer cooperation between \nEurope and Asia as part of international efforts to implement global anti-money laundering network. ASEM Asian \nmembers are China, Korea, Japan, Brunei, Indonesia, Singapore, Philippines, Thailand, Viet Nam and Malaysia. ", "5  \n \nmoney laundering law; and (vii) hold public workshops to include the private sector in Jakarta and \nthe major provinces to increase awareness of money laundering as a crime and related issues \n(\u201csocialization\u201d of the law). Attempts to strengthen the implementation of customer identification \nregulations10  in  an  environment,  such  as  Indonesia,  where  unique  identity  documents  (e.g., \npassports) are not widespread could create potential barriers to access to the formal financial \nsystem that would disproportionately affect poorer segments of the population. Costs of the \nsystems  needed  for  financial  institutions  to  comply  with  regulations  could  also  have  anti-\ncompetitive effects by favoring a small number of larger institutions better able to absorb them. \nThis TA will address these potential risks, and support the development of measures that balance \nthe  need  for  an  effective  anti-money  laundering  regime  with  the  need  to  maintain  market \ncompetition and adequate access to services provided by the formal financial sector. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.875 million equivalent comprising a foreign exchange cost \nof $1.165 million and a local currency cost of $0.71 million equivalent.  The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $1.5 million equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$0.335 million equivalent of the local currency cost, on a grant basis from the Asian Currency \nCrisis Support Facility funded by the Government of Japan, or from other TA resources available \nto ADB.  The Government will provide the remaining $0.375 million equivalent through the \nprovision of counterpart staff, office space, and contingencies. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are presented in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The executing agency for the TA will be the MJHR, and the implementing agencies will be \n(i) BI, (ii) the Directorate General of Financial Institutions in MOF, (iii) BAPEPAM in MOF, (iv) the \nMinistry of Home Affairs, (v) BPKP (Financial and Development Supervisory Board), (vi) the \nAttorney General\u2019s Office, and (vii) the police. All the implementing agencies are members of the \nGovernment\u2019s Working Group on Money Laundering. It is estimated that 47 person-months of \nconsulting services will be required, comprising 22 person-months of international and 25 person-\nmonths of domestic services. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are provided in \nAppendix  3.  A  firm  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. The consultants will provide inception, quarterly, and final reports. The consultants \nwill submit the inception report within one month of TA commencement, which will be discussed \nand agreed upon at a tripartite meeting of the consultants, the Government, and ADB. A midterm \nreview will be conducted to discuss the findings and progress of the TA. The consultants will \nsubmit a draft final report for review at a tripartite meeting and will incorporate comments in the \nfinal TA report. The TA implementation period will be 18 months and is planned to commence by \nJuly 2002 and to be completed by December 2003. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n15.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance, \non a grant basis, to the Government of Indonesia in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of \n$1,500,000 for the purpose of the Development of an Anti-Money Laundering Regime. \n                                                           \n10      In June 2001, BI issued a new regulation called the Application of Know Your Customer Principles.
