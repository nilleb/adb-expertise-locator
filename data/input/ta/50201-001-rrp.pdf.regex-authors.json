THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Public\u2013Private Partnerships Demonstration \nProgram to Transform Delivery of Elderly Care Services in Yichang, Hubei.1 \n \n2.  The proposed Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance will be the first sovereign, \nresults-based loan (RBL) for the promotion of public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) in the PRC \nthat will likely have a catalytic effect and transform the manner in which social services are \ndelivered by local governments in the PRC. The PPP demonstration program will build capacity \nfor developing, procuring, and managing transparent PPPs, and finance a demonstration PPP \nfor socially inclusive, efficient, and quality elderly care services (ECS) in one municipality of the \nPRC (Yichang, Hubei). The program will serve as a demonstration for other local governments \non how PPP can be used for the delivery of public social services and, therefore, may create \nmore opportunities for ADB to finance inclusive and efficient service delivery in the PRC.2  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  Sector context. One of the most significant social challenges facing the PRC today is a \nrapidly aging population. The proportion of people above the age of 60 across the PRC is \nexpected to grow from around 14% in 2016 to 34% by 2050, while those 80 and older will \nincrease from about 18 million in 2010 to a projected 98 million by 2050.3 As a result of rapid \nurbanization, the impact of the one-child policy on families, and large-scale internal workforce \nmigration to urban areas, traditional family support systems are increasingly becoming unable to \nmeet elderly care needs. For the majority of elderly people, home- and community-based ECS \nare the preferred option but are inadequate at the present time.4  ECS are provided by public \nand private operators and, except for some well-managed ECS facilities, many public and \nprivate residential facilities provide low-quality services. Market-oriented reforms that promote \nservice-oriented,  inclusive,  and  high-standard  ECS  catering  to  different  levels  of  care  are \nneeded. The diversity of the demand for ECS requires an innovative response that offers a \nrange of quality yet affordable services, including the use of technology-based approaches such \nas  telemedicine,  and  training  for  care  providers,  ranging  from  fully  dependent  and  semi-\nindependent residential care to different levels of community-based and home-based care.5 \n \n4.  The Government of the PRC has identified Yichang as the preferred municipality to \nimplement a pilot PPP ECS as the Yichang municipal government (YMG) recently approved the \nYichang Long-Term Care Services Strategic Plan, 2016\u20132030, which is a long-term, strategic \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  PPPs have been identified as a major driver of ADB\u2019s partnership with the PRC, particularly to promote efficiency \nand quality of services. ADB\u2019s support for PPPs is aligned with the PRC\u2019s long-term goals of achieving more \neffective delivery of services to the elderly, and the proposed loan is the first in a series to strengthen local \ngovernment implementation of ECS included in the country program pipeline. \n3  United Nations. 2011. World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision. New York.  \n4 The favored national policy of 90\u20137\u20133 is based on the broad assumption that 90% of the elderly are either \nindependent or require only home-based care, 7% need more extensive community-based ECS, with the residual \n3% requiring residential-based care. Local government has traditionally just looked after and provided subsidy to a \ngroup referred to as \u201cthe three no\u2019s\u201d. These are elderly people with no income, no ability to work, and no family \nsupport. \n5  Use of telecommunication and information technologies to provide clinical health care at a distance to help improve \naccess to home-based medical services that would often not be available to distant communities.  ", "2 \n \nplan for the provision of ECS6 in Yichang. Yichang is a third-tier city in the Yangtze River \nEconomic Belt region, with 20% of its population, or almost 148,000 elders, over the age of 60 \n(which is higher than the national average of 15%). The city typifies the average medium-sized \ncity that characterizes much of the PRC outside of the coastal belt.7 Initial ECS demand analysis \nindicates there are currently about 2,000 elderly people who need residential care and about \n23,000 who need home- and community-based care. The current absorption rate for residential \nECS (based on the number of beds utilized) and the projected penetration rate indicate that the \nECS facility market in Yichang is gaining momentum, and with adequate marketing by providers \nthere will be a demand for an additional 3,666 beds in 2017. The projections result in a revised \npenetration rate of 1.58%, a growth of 55% over the historical penetration rate of 1.02%. This \ninitial demand analysis for Yichang shows that the proposed number of beds for the program \n(1,255)  will  satisfy  only  a  percentage  of  the  demand  for  care  needs  of  Yichang\u2019s  elderly \npopulation.8  \n \n5.  Poverty and social analysis reveals that there is a high demand for expanded, good- \nquality ECS among those who have lost their spouses, do not have a family member residing \nwith them, are infirm or disabled, or are elderly women. Currently all ECS facilities in Yichang \nhave lower service standards than those in major PRC cities. Furthermore, there are inadequate \nlinks between health care and ECS providers. Many ECS facilities do not have medical staff for \neven  basic  health  care.  There  is  a  clear  need  to  introduce  innovative  approaches  when \nexpanding ECS coverage to overcome such weaknesses. \n \n6.  Public\u2013private partnership policy context. The design and implementation of PPPs \nfor the provision of public services face major regulatory, institutional, and financial challenges. \nPPP implementation in the PRC is hampered by a lack of transparency, regulatory gaps, and \nPPP regulations that overlap and which are poorly coordinated with other regulations, including \nrules on land, tax, budget, and government procurement. PPPs in the PRC are also often \ncharacterized by a significant imbalance in the allocation of risks and responsibilities. Moreover, \nwhile there is accumulated experience in infrastructure PPPs, a major barrier with regard to \nPPP implementation in the social sectors is a lack of knowledge and expertise within local \ngovernments  to  understand  the  intricacies  of  social  sector  PPP  design,  procurement,  and \ncontract management. Ministerial and central guidelines and requirements for PPPs issued by \nthe Ministry of Finance (MOF) in 2015 indicate that the policy framework is improving the \nenabling environment, but a lot needs to be done to translate this into PPP projects at the local \ngovernment level that are in line with international good practice for PPPs.9 \n \n7.  The Government of the PRC considers PPP for ECS to be the most urgent need to \npromote  efficiency  and  quality  of  service  delivery.  The  government  wants  to  promote  a \nmechanism for genuine and transparent PPPs (i.e., transparent bidding processes with open \nand fair competition) that  can be replicated nationwide to (i) close the gap between local \ngovernment fiscal capacity and the increasing demand for social services; and (ii) search for \ninnovation, better technology, and management skills to tackle sophisticated issues such as \nelderly care. PPPs have been implemented in the PRC since the late 1980s but the policy \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2016.

Unpublished.  \n9  The current policy framework governing PPP has evolved over time and is a patchwork of measures.  \n ", "  3   \nemphasis of PPPs has significantly shifted since 2014.10 In 2014, the Third Plenum of the \nCommunist  Party  of  China  called  for  a  decisive  role  for  the  market  in  delivering  public \nservices.11 Between late 2014 and May 2015, the MOF and the National Development and \nReform  Commission  compiled  a  database  of  more  than  7,700  PPP  project  proposals \n(amounting to $1.37 trillion), and selected 200 demonstration PPPs to be developed in the next \nfive-year period.12 However, such PPPs need to be based on firm policy foundations, political \ncommitment, and a sound and predictable legal and regulatory environment. Market players \ngenerally require that these policy conditions and the public sector capacity are in place when \nconsidering their participation in a project.  \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n8.  It is in the above context that the Government of the PRC has requested ADB\u2019s support \nto help transform how local governments implement PPPs that provide value for money; are \nwell designed, transparently contracted, and well managed; and deliver effective services to the \npublic. The government seeks a sound mechanism for the provision of integrated community- \nand home-based ECS that can be replicated nationwide. The program is aligned with the PRC\u2019s \n13th Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020, which supports strengthening the ECS system in the PRC,13 \nand with government policies for introducing and expanding PPP in public services to bring \nefficiency, innovation, and quality that is affordable. Recent policy directives issued for the \ndevelopment  of  the  ECS  industry14 recognize  the  need  to  improve  services  and  human \nresources, develop the ECS market, and outline the role of local governments and private social \ncapital. The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 pillars on \ninclusive growth and institutional and governance reforms;15 the Midterm Review of Strategy \n2020; the Operational Plan for Health, 2015\u20132020; the Public\u2013Private Partnership Operational \nPlan, 2012\u20132020;16 and the Upper Middle-Income Country Approach Paper.17 It also supports \nthe programming priorities included in the operational directions for 2016.18 \n \n9.  Building  local  government  capacity  to  apply  appropriate  laws  and  developing  a \ndemonstration ECS PPP requires the use of the national regulatory framework for PPPs while \nproviding results-based financing to support the YMG\u2019s program to implement PPPs for ECS. \nTo systematically build institutional capacity and create the best demonstration practice for \napplication by other local governments, the program will (i) use national PPP frameworks and \nlocal regulations, (ii) focus on results and performance, (iii) take a risk-based approach, and (iv) \n                                                \n10  Traditionally, state-owned enterprises have had bigger participation in PPPs in the PRC while foreign and market \ninvestors have had little space in the market. Market players and social capital partners often include state-owned \nenterprises. \n11 Government of the PRC, State Council. 2014.

RBL is the \nmost appropriate modality to finance the program to strengthen capacity to design, manage, \nand implement a true PPP in ECS using national regulations and guidelines because it will \nleverage ADB financing to transform service delivery by the YMG, and enable other municipal \ngovernments to replicate future similar programs without ADB financing in a sustainable manner.  \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s value added is in introducing international expertise and good practice models \nand supporting an honest dialogue between potential bidders and the local government that \nensures transparency and credibility to design a quality PPP project that (i) offers genuine value \nfor money, (ii) generates high-level policy dialogue with the government, and (iii) translates \nnational PPP policies into an actionable PPP approach. Most importantly, local governments, \nincluding the YMG, are currently ill-prepared to take on transformational PPP projects without \nextensive external support. ADB\u2019s support is timely and will introduce innovation, contribute to \nknowledge on local-level PPPs and ECS standards, and have a high demonstration impact. \nADB has already gained credibility with the Government of the PRC for responding to its PPP \nagenda with an appropriate mix of policy dialogue, sharing of international experience, and \nproposing an innovative approach. These efforts have placed ADB as a lead partner in the area \nof PPP and local government delivery of ECS. \n \nC.  Program Scope \n \n11.  The  program  is  anchored  in  the  long-term  care  (LTC)  plan,19 which  focuses  on \nstrengthening the public system of ECS delivery and introducing PPPs to increase the supply of \nfacilities. At the request of the Government of the PRC, ADB has provided extensive support to \nthe YMG in designing the program, which will support the PPP cornerstone of the LTC plan, \nwhile a public sector loan in 2017 will support strengthening of the public system of ECS \ndelivery. The program will be guided by YMG\u2019s policy framework for PPPs which is aligned with \nthe State Council and MOF regulations governing PPPs for social sectors.20 The program will \nintroduce a pilot PPP for ECS to create the required capacity in the YMG to expand socially \ninclusive, high-quality ECS using PPPs. It will also support Government of the PRC policies and \npriorities for introducing and expanding PPP in social sectors, particularly ECS, by mobilizing \nprivate capital to expand efficiency, innovation, and quality services. The Government of the \nPRC  has  espoused  a  long-term  programmatic  approach21 so  as  to  create  an  enabling \nenvironment for transparent PPPs and encourage local governments to introduce PPPs in ECS \nand the health sector (para. 7). The broader Government of the PRC program envisions rolling \nout PPPs in several local governments during the 13th Five-Year Plan period, while the RBL \nprogram in Yichang will serve as a demonstration for other local governments. \n \n \n \n                                                \n19  With the support of policy and advisory technical assistance financed by ADB since 2014 (ADB. 2014. Technical \nAssistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Strategic Elderly Care Services Development in Yichang. \nManila), the YMG has prepared the Long-Term Care Services Strategic Plan, 2016\u20132030 to address growing \nneeds for ECS, including development of service standards and expanded use of PPPs.

The program\u2019s impact will be socially inclusive delivery of social services using PPPs. \nThe outcome of the program is that quality ECS using PPPs by local governments will be \ndelivered. The program has two outputs:  \n  \n(i)  Local  government  capacity  to  design,  procure,  manage,  and  deliver \neffective  services  through  public\u2013private  partnerships  in  elderly  care \nservices  developed. This output includes capacity building to systematically \naddress the challenges faced by local governments to optimize PPP design and \nimplementation within the national regulatory framework. This will help manage \nthe risk of using PPPs to introduce advanced elderly care concepts, ensuring that \nlocal governments have PPP systems in place to (a) introduce innovative and \nelderly and environmentally sustainable design features in the ECS facilities; (b) \ndevelop  key  performance  indicators  that  take  account  of  international  ECS \nstandards  and  are  compatible  with  national  guidelines;  (c)  develop  the  PPP \nstructure and financing model, including a social inclusion strategy; (d) provide \ntransaction support to design and procure the PPP concession contracts with \nECS service providers (PPP contracts); (e) perform integrity, financial viability, \nand  safeguards  due  diligence  of  relevant  key  stakeholders;  (f)  develop  and \ndeliver a PPP training plan for relevant YMG staff; (g) develop and implement \nPPP contracts and program monitoring systems in the delivery of services; and \n(h) disseminate lessons from ECS PPP implementation. \n  \n(ii)  A socially inclusive public\u2013private partnership demonstration program for \nelderly care services in Yichang successfully implemented. Financing will be \nprovided to enable the YMG to meet agreed key performance indicators and \noutput  targets  for  well-designed  PPPs  to  provide  integrated  ECS  services \nincorporating inclusive and best-design features. Given the risks associated with \nintroducing a more complex PPP in a third-tier city, the government will provide \nthe land and undertake basic construction of the ECS facilities with appropriate \ndesign parameters, and the PPP contract(s) will be executed with the private \nsector to fully equip, operate, and maintain the ECS facilities. The program will \nsupport the YMG to meet the care needs of the majority of its elderly people, who \nare  lower-middle  and  middle-income  pensioners  and  are  the  principal  target \nbeneficiaries  of  this  program.  The  integrated  ECS  facilities  are  expected  to \ninclude  residential,  medical,  and  nonmedical  services  and  provide  outreach \nservices to support community- and home-based care. Community- and home-\nbased care provisions will be included within the PPP contracts. The services to \nbe provided by the concessionaires to residents and the local community of \nelderly  people  will  cover  different  levels  of  care  needs  (from  mildly  to  fully \ndependent elderly people) and will include nursing care; skilled cognitive care; \nday care; social counseling; recreational activities; and support for activities of \ndaily living such as walking, bathing, dressing, toileting or incontinence, brushing \nteeth, and eating. Home-based care will include a range of services such as \nhousekeeping, shopping support, preparation of meals, routine medical check-\nups, and physiotherapy.  \n \n13.  The program has a concise results framework based on PPP capacity building needs \nand Yichang\u2019s LTC plan. Disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) of the RBL program are based \non the program\u2019s results framework, are the basis for disbursing ADB financing, and correspond \nto the program\u2019s financing needs. The proposed DLIs were selected within five results areas \nand formulated for  their  criticality for  achieving  high quality  and  efficient  ECS that  will  be \n ", "6 \n \ndelivered through PPPs in the integrated ECS facilities (Table 1).22  \n \nTable 1: Disbursement-Linked Indicators \nDisbursement  Share of Total \nAllocated  ADB \nIndicator  ($ million)  Financing (%) \nOutcome     \n1.

However, the \nexact number of ECS facilities will be finalized during the detailed feasibility design and agreed with ADB. \n ", "  7   \n15.  Program financing. It is estimated that the YMG will provide $55.0 million and the \nprivate sector will provide $23.4 million for the program. The YMG has requested a loan of $50 \nmillion from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the RBL program. The loan will \nhave a 26-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an annuity repayment method based \non a 9.50% discount factor, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB's \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% \nper  year,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  program \nagreements. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 18.96 years and the maturity premium \npayable to ADB is 0.20% per annum.23 The financing plan is summarized in Table 3.  \n \nTable 3: Program Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nGovernment  55.0  42.9 \nPrivate sectora   23.4  18.2 \nAsian Development Bank   \n  Ordinary capital resources (loan)  50.0  38.9 \nTotal  128.4  100.0 \na Assumes that private service funds initial investments in furniture, equipment, mobilization, including taxes and \ncontingencies, and initial working capital of $4.7 million and recurrent costs of $18.7 million will be covered from \ntariff revenues. \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates and prefeasibility study. \n \n16.  Disbursement  arrangements.  The  program  will  provide  advance  financing  and \nfinancing for the prior result relating to securing the sites for the ECS facilities (DLI 2), which is \nessential to the successful subsequent implementation of the program. The YMG may submit a \nwithdrawal  application  upon  achievement  of  any  DLIs,  along  with  evidence  verifying \nachievement of the DLIs, and also for the advance financing and for the achievement of the \nprior result. Verification mechanisms and protocols have been established using public and \nindependent sources and are clarified in the verification protocols. Disbursements are allowed \nfor partial, early, or late achievement of DLIs, and will be made to an account specified by the \ngovernment for the purpose of program implementation. \n \nF.  Capacity Development and Program Action Plan \n \n17.  The YMG does not currently have the necessary experience or capacity to design and \nimplement PPPs. Therefore, capacity development is embedded in the design of the program, \nwith output 1 supporting transparent PPP development, and this has already started during \nprogram preparation.24 The RBL program will build capacity through the YMG engaging key \nexperts who will work alongside the program management office (PMO) and the PPP team of \nthe Yichang Finance Bureau (YFB) and Yichang Civil Affairs Bureau (YCAB) to develop service \nstandards for ECS; support financial management, procurement, and contract management; \ndevelop  monitoring  systems;  implement  the  PPP  projects;  and  facilitate  dissemination.25 A \nprogram action plan, incorporating actions for capacity building, is included. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The program will be implemented from January 2017 to December 2022, while the PPP \ncontracts are expected to operate for 25 years. The oversight of the broader PPP program will \nbe led by the Government of the PRC acting through the National Development and Reform \n                                                \n23 Loan Agreement and Program Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n24 Using policy and advisory technical assistance (footnote 19). \n25 Program Implementation Document (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) has detailed \ncapacity building component description. \n ", "8 \n \nCommission and MOF. The program executing agency is the YMG, which assumes overall \naccountability for the program. The YMG has established a high-level coordinating and program \nleading group to oversee the program. This leading group will be led by the vice-mayor with \nhigh-level  representation  from  the  YCAB,  Yichang  Development  and  Reform  Commission, \nYichang  Environmental  Protection  Bureau,  YFB,  Yichang  Health  and  Family  Planning \nCommission,  Yichang  Housing  Investment  and  Development  Company,  Yichang  Land \nAdministration Bureau, and Yichang Planning Bureau. Under the program leading group, a \nPMO will be established, which would be placed in the YFB during the program preparation and \nPPP operator selection stage and be transferred to the YCAB during the implementation stage \nof the PPP contracts. The PMO will act on behalf of the YMG to manage all the preparation and \nimplementation activities, and play a leading role in (i) communicating and coordinating with \nADB;  (ii)  coordinating  with  all  involved  agencies,  departments,  and  institutes  for  program \nimplementation;  (iii)  submitting  program  implementation  progress  reports,  safeguards \nmonitoring reports, and annual audit reports to ADB; (iv) carrying out program performance and \ncompliance monitoring; and (v) reviewing withdrawal applications and supporting documents. \n \n19.  The program implementation agencies include the YCAB, YFB, and Yichang Housing \nInvestment  and  Development  Company.  The  YFB  will  be  responsible  PPP  design  and \nprocurement, and will also support program monitoring throughout the life of the program. The \nYichang  Housing  Investment  and  Development  Company  will  be  responsible for the  basic \nconstruction of the ECS facilities. The YCAB will be responsible for the implementation of a \nsocially inclusive ECS PPP demonstration program in Yichang, including contract management \nand supervision of ECS during the facilities design, equipping, and operation stages.   \n \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n20.  The program is technically sound and in line with the YMG\u2019s LTC plan, which includes \nthe expanded use of PPPs. Piloting a demonstration ECS PPP will help the YMG strengthen its \nsystems for designing and managing PPPs, and will help raise much-needed resources and \ninnovation from the private sector for ECS. The PPP based on service contracts will attract ECS \nproviders rather than developers. The program\u2019s proposed implementation arrangements are \nappropriate to help the YMG develop capacity for ECS PPPs. The program\u2019s expenditure and \nfinancing plan is based on appropriate assumptions for demand and services as concluded by \nthe prefeasibility study and preliminary market sounding and shows that the projected tariff \nrevenue of CNY2,100 per month per elderly person will be sufficient to make the PPP viable. \n \n21.  The program will have a substantial economic impact as it will protect vulnerable elderly \nfrom health or disability shocks, reduce the possibility of extended hospital stays, and create \nemployment  opportunities  in  geriatric  care.  The  program  also  has  positive  social  impacts, \nproviding the elderly population with services that are of a higher quality and standard than \nthose that exist currently in Yichang. The program targets elderly people, 11% of whom are \nabove 80 years of age, with lower-middle and middle-income pension levels in Yichang city. \nLow-income  pensioners  will  be  included  using  a  cross-subsidy  or  government  subsidy \nmechanism, details of which will be considered during the detailed PPP feasibility and design \nstage. The program will mainly benefit people who require assisted living, and it will also benefit \nelderly women who are more vulnerable given the care burden on other family members.  \n \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n22.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  system  and  institutional  assessment. The  YMG has \n ", "  9   \nsuccessful past experience in the implementation of a recent ADB project that introduced a \nwidely acclaimed bus rapid transit system.26 With capacity building under the program, the YMG \nwill be able to successfully implement an ECS PPP and strengthen monitoring systems for \nimplementation within both the YFB and YCAB.   \n \n23.  Fiduciary systems. The procurement and financial management systems assessments \nconfirm that the program will need to support the YMG to strengthen its capacity for designing, \nprocuring, and implementing PPPs for ECS. The Government of the PRC\u2019s Procurement Law, \nunder certain conditions and procedural controls, allows for competitive negotiation, competitive \nconsultation, and single-source procurement, which does not necessarily comply with ADB\u2019s \nkey procurement principle of open competition. The program\u2019s design will introduce measures to \nexclude the use of such noncompetitive practices.  \n \n24.  The Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities \nin Results-Based Lending for Programs were explained to and discussed with the government \nand the YMG.27 \n \n25.  Safeguard systems. The program\u2019s environmental impacts are confirmed as category B. \nUnder the program some existing buildings will be remodeled or partially demolished, and new \nbuildings constructed at the selected sites. A potential benefit of the program is the opportunity it \nprovides to incorporate green building and space features. Potential adverse impacts are noise \nand dust; disposal of solid waste and fugitive dust generated during construction, demolition, or \nremodeling; and noise generated by construction work and use of heavy mechanical equipment. \nThese impacts are temporary and can be mitigated to comply with the applicable environmental \nstandards. The program will not have any impact on virgin land, and it avoids protected areas, \necologically sensitive habitats, and cultural heritage sites. An environmental action plan will \nguide environmental mitigation by complying with the local environmental regulatory framework \nand ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and an information disclosure mechanism for \nprogram environmental safeguards will be established. YMG has the capacity and resources to \nimplement the environmental mitigation measures of the program. \n \n26.  The program\u2019s involuntary resettlement impacts are confirmed as category C, and none \nof the involuntary resettlement policy principles in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement apply for \nthe program. The program will not acquire any land, negatively affect income and livelihood \nsources, or affect access to common property and resources of any person or community. In \nfact, it will provide employment for both skilled and unskilled workers at construction sites and at \nthe ECS facilities. The program is category B for indigenous peoples as ethnic minority elderly \npeople are expected to benefit from the program. Ethnic minority elderly people will be provided \nequal  access  to  ECS, and  the  program  action  plan  will  ensure  that ECS  providers  make \nnecessary provisions for appropriate recreational activities and any special dietary requirements.  \n \nC.  Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n \n27.  The program is piloting a new approach with a local government in a third-tier city in the \nPRC, making this an overall high-risk program, but the overall benefits derived from building \ncapacity and demonstrating innovative ECS far outweigh the costs and risks. Major risks and \nmitigating measures are summarized in Table 4.  \n \n                                                \n26 ADB. 2013.

Disbursement Principles \n \nFinancing prior results. The Public-Private Partnerships Demonstration Program to Transform Delivery of Elderly Care \nServices in Yichang will finance prior results. The prior result that has been selected is one that is critical to the successful \nsubsequent implementation of the program, and need to be accomplished at the latest by the effectiveness date of the program. The \ntotal amount for such financing is $3 million which does not exceed 20% of the ADB financing (i.e., $10 million). The time frame for \nsuch financing is within 12 months before the signing of the legal agreements. \n \nAdvance financing. The program will also provide advance financing up to the amount of $12 million, so that the total of \nfinancing for prior results and advance financing does not exceed 30% (i.e., $15 million) of ADB financing.  \n \nPartial disbursements are allowed. Partial disbursements are allowed for DLI 3 and DLI 4 and the formulas for partial \ndisbursement are detailed in the verification protocols (see Table A3.2 below). Once the remaining targets are met for any partially \nmet DLI, the balance of disbursement allocation for the DLI can be disbursed. \n \nB.   Disbursement Procedures \n \nYMG may submit a withdrawal application upon achievement of any DLIs, along with evidence verifying achievement of the \nDLIs. YMG may also submit a withdrawal application upon approval of the loan for the advance financing and for achievement of the \nprior result. Disbursements are allowed for early or late achievement of DLIs. Verification mechanisms and protocols have been \nestablished using public and independent sources and are clarified in the verification protocols. \n \nThe PMO will collect all reports and information necessary to verify accomplishment of the DLIs and prepare a draft DLI \nachievement report. Achievement reports will refer to the month and year of the DLI achievement indicated in the DLI Table A3.3 \nbelow. All such reports will be appropriately authorized by a designated signatory, acting for and on behalf of YMG who will make the \nwithdrawal application accompanied by the evidence of DLI achievement. Where ADB identifies issues with the DLI achievement, it \nwill relay its concerns to the YMG within one month of its receipt of the withdrawal application for further verification.  \n \n ", "    Appendix 3  17 \n \nTable A3.2:  Verification Protocols \nDLIs  Definition and Description of Achievement and  Information Source and  Verification Agency and Procedure \n  Verification Timeframe  Frequency   \nOutput 1: Local government capacity to design, procure, and manage ECS PPPs developed \nDLI 1  Definition     \nYMG\u2019s PMO capacity in PPP  YMG will establish a dedicated PMO for the program which  Capacity building consultant  Independent verification by ADB PPP \ndesign, management, and  will  together  with  relevant  personnel  undertake  training  reports  specialists. \neffective service delivery built.  required for the PPP.      \n     \nOutput 2: A socially inclusive PPP demonstration program for the ECS sector in Yichang successfully implemented \nDLI 2  Definition     \nECS facilities with elderly and  All ECS facilities must be designed with sensitivity to the  Final and approved detailed  Prior Result: YFB will be required to (a) \nenvironmentally sustainable  specific needs of the elderly to whom these ECS facilities  designs of the ECS facilities  issue  a  formal  confirmation  that  the \nand inclusive design features  will  cater  to.
