The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) will contribute to a sustainable and \nefficient energy sector in Turkmenistan through (i) a strategy and road map for energy efficiency; \n(ii) supporting transition to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) implementation;  \nand (iii) transferring key project implementation knowledge in the areas of detailed engineering, \nprocurement and environmental safeguards.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported Turkmenistan\u2019s energy sector for \nincreased electric interconnections with neighboring countries and increased power exports. \nADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Turkmenistan, 2018\u20132019 emphasizes the following \nkey areas of assistance: energy efficiency in generation, loss reduction in transmission, cross-\nborder power trade, and capacity building and institutional strengthening. \n \n3.  Energy efficiency traditionally has never been a priority in countries that are rich in energy \nresources, as domestic energy prices are very low. However, because of increasing focus on \nenergy export, there is a growing interest to promote energy efficiency, as each unit of saved \nenergy  represents  revenue  in  foreign  currency  if  the  unit  is  exported,  with  very  little  new \ninvestment. The opportunity for energy efficiency is also quite significant as most of the equipment \nwere built and bought in the 70s, and some of them are operating in sub-optimal conditions. The \nscale of opportunity is also reflected by the fact that Turkmenistan is one of the countries with the \nhighest energy intensity.  \n \n4.  Absence  of  detailed  assessment  of  energy  efficiency  potential  and  a  plan  for \nimplementation is essential to mainstream energy efficiency projects. Development of human \ncapacity and understanding of the best available technologies in the entire power value chain\u2014\ngeneration, transmission, distribution, and end use appliances\u2014is also an essential element.  \n \n5.  Turkmenistan,  as  a  signatory  to  the  Paris  Agreement  has  developed  its  Intended \nNationally Determined Contribution commitments. Energy efficiency measures and investment \ncould enable the country in achieving those commitments. This technical assistance will help \ndevelop an energy efficiency strategy and road map to mainstream energy efficiency.  \n \n6.  To tap into the international capital market, Turkemenenergo plans to move towards IFRS. \nSupport from a team of technical experts is essential to identify actions for developing capacities \n(both human and systems) to move to IFRS and continue preparing financial statements with \nIFRS standards. The introduction of IFRS for Turkmenenergo will contribute to stronger financial \nmanagement and lead to more sustainable development in Turkmenistan. \n \n7.  Turkmenenergo also have expressed interest to understand and learn from international \nbest practices in engineering, procurement and environmental safeguards. Implementation of \ninternational best practices would improve implementation of current projects and enable effective \ndevelopment of future energy sector projects.  \n \n ", "2      \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: A strategy and road map for energy efficiency developed. Output 1 will \nenable policy makers a comprehensive understating of the energy efficiency potential in the \ncountry and develop strategies and plans to achieve those gains. The strategy and roadmap will \npropose step-by-step actions to be taken by the government, including the development of \npolicies, laws, and regulations, together with priority areas for public and private investment. The \nconsultants  will:  (i)  identify  energy  efficiency  projects  in  power  generation,  transmission, \ndistribution, and end-use equipment, considering the best available technologies in each area; (ii) \ndevelop strategy, and a road map for implementing those projects and support from the regulatory \nframework; and (iii) conduct trainings and workshops on energy efficiency.  \n \n9.  Output 2: International Financial Reporting Standards implementation supported.  \nOutput  2  will  support  government\u2019s  own  decision1 to  implement  IFRS  in  all  state  owned \nenterprises. The TA will support Turkmenenergo transition to IFRS, and the consultants will: (i) \nprepare a diagnostics study of current practices; (ii) analyze gaps and identify key areas requiring \nchanges between Turkmenistan\u2019s national accounting standards (which are currently applied to \nTurkmenenergo\u2019s  financial  statements)  and  IFRS;  (iii)  review,  recommend  and  establish \ninvestment  needed  for  Turkmenenergo\u2019s  information  technology  systems  to  produce \nTurkmenenergo\u2019s IFRS financial statements beginning in 2020; (iv) develop a detailed action plan \nfor transition to full IFRS implementation from 2021; (v) provide training and capacity development \nplan for Turkmenenergo\u2019s accounting staff to prepare and train others in their transition to IFRS; \nand (vi) support Turkmenenergo in the preparation of IFRS annual accounts and financial \nstatements for 2018, 2019, and 2020. \n \n10.  Output 3: Project implementation knowledge transferred. Output 3 will supplement \nand improve the knowledge and capacity of the Ministry of Energy and Turkmenenergo have \ndeveloped by implementing many large-scale power projects. This will enable them to develop \nbankable projects to be financed by international financiers. The consultants under the technical \nassistance will help MOE and Turkmenenergo to understand the gap, if any, between the \ninternational best practices and current practices in the energy sector. Knowledge transfer will be \ntargeted  in  three  key  areas  of  project  implementation\u2014engineering,  procurement  and \nenvironmental  safeguards\u2014and  the  key  activities  will  include  technical  papers,  seminar, \nworkshops and trainings.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 1. \n \n12.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nand housing accommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and \nother in-kind contributions. The government was informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n                                                \n1 The presidential decree issued in December 2017. \n ", "  3 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented from November 2018 to May 2021. ADB will administer the \nTA through the Central and West Asia Department\u2019s Energy Division, with support from the \nTurkmenistan Resident Mission. The Central and West Asia Department\u2019s Energy Division will \nselect, supervise, and recruit consultants. \n \n14.  All TA disbursement will be made following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).
