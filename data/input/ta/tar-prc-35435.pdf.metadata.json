The  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Developing  a  Result-Based  National \nMonitoring and Evaluation System for Key Projects was included in the 2004 country strategy \nand program for the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).1 During the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s) 7\u201314 December 2004 Fact-Finding Mission, the Government reiterated its request for \nthe  TA.  The  Mission  reached  agreement  on  the  rationale,  goals  and  objectives,  scope, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost  estimates,  and  financing  arrangements  of  the  TA  with \nconcerned agencies, the key project inspectorate office (KPIO) of the National Development \nand Reform Commission (NDRC) and Ministry of Finance. Appendix 1 provides the design and \nmonitoring framework. \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n2.  Over  the  last  25  years,  the  PRC  experienced  unprecedented  economic  growth \n(averaging  9.5%  per  year)  that  lifted  hundreds  of  millions  of  people  out  of  poverty.  This \neconomic growth was driven largely by several factors, including foreign direct investment \ninflows, increasing domestic private sector development, and massive state investment. The \nhigh levels of domestic investment are financed by the PRC\u2019s high savings, which were mostly \nchanneled to state-owned banks and state-issued bonds. As of the end of 2003, more than \n10,000 projects were financed by state bonds, with about 400 projects added each year. Total \nstate investments amounted to more than CNY4 trillion. Most state investments were directed to \nlarge infrastructure projects. Some of this huge investment is at risk due to increasing difficulties \nand complexities related to administering and implementing such a vast number of projects. \nConcerns for corruption in public investment projects are rising among government officials, \ninvestors and taxpayers, who increasingly demand to see the results of investments.    \n \n3.  ADB provided two prior TA grants to help develop and strengthen evaluation capacities \nin the PRC. The first TA2 was approved in 1997 and completed in 1999. This TA was formulated \nduring the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991\u20131995), when about 20% of the PRC\u2019s 500 key state \nprojects  were  incurring  financial  losses.  The  Government  felt  a  strong  need  to  conduct \nevaluations to obtain feedback to improve project planning, implementation, and management. \nThe TA responded to this need by providing training in evaluation methodologies and practices \nused by development agencies for key government agencies and organizations, including China \nInternational  Engineering  Consulting  Corporation,  China  National  Audit  Office,  State \nDevelopment Bank, and the then State Development Planning Commission (SDPC). Building on \nthe results achieved under the first TA, ADB provided a second TA.3 The second TA was \napproved in 1999 and completed in 2002. It focused on the newly created KPIO under SDPC. \nKPIO was responsible for inspecting state key investment projects for progress, quality and \npossible deviations, including corruption. The objective of the second TA was to upgrade KPIO \nstaff  capability  in  project  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E).  The  goal  was  to  improve  the \ndevelopment effectiveness of the PRC\u2019s public sector investment projects. The TA also had a \nsecondary objective: to nurture an M&E culture within KPIOs, which had been primarily focusing \non input monitoring. The TA was efficacious in achieving its objectives. In particular, it was \nrecently nominated as a candidate for the 2004 TA Award program jointly initiated by ADB and \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 20 April 2004, under the title \nStrengthening the Key Project Inspectorate. \n2  ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance for Strengthening of Evaluation Capacity in the People\u2019s Republic of China. \nManila (TA 2821-PRC, for $400,000, approved on 4 July 1997). \n3  ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance for Project Performance Management and Evaluation Capacity Building. Manila \n(TA 3375-PRC, for $900,000, approved on 27 December 1999). ", "2     \nMinistry of Finance for being timely and relevant, well designed, and having had substantial \nimpact on policies and regulations related to result-based project evaluation and management. \n \n4.  Lessons identified in the TA completion reports for those two TA projects included (i) \nstrong ownership and leadership support from the Government are essential to sustain full and \neffective  TA  implementation;  (ii)  appropriate  consideration  for  local  languages  and \nunderstanding of local cultures and traditions are essential to facilitate faster dissemination of \ninformation and generate greater acceptance; and (iii) cost-effectiveness was low in the case of \nthe second TA, with respect to the international study tour, and future TA designs should ensure \nthat learning benefits match resources spent.4  \n \n5.  SDPC, restructured and renamed NDRC in 2003, recognized that simply monitoring \nproject inputs does not provide enough policy relevance in terms of assessing the achievement \nof the country\u2019s development goals, including alleviation of poverty in less-developed provinces \nand sustainable development. Starting in 2002, NDRC took a major initiative, as recommended \nby the second TA, to develop a computerized project M&E system known as the key project \nmonitoring and evaluation information system. This system will link the project management \nsystems  of  KPIOs  at  the  national,  provincial,  and  municipal  levels  and  those  of  project \nimplementation agencies and contractors. The system, which cost about CNY50 million, so far, \nin initial development, received strong support from the State Council and will form a subsystem \nof the State Council\u2019s macroeconomic information system, currently under development. The \nsystem will consist of two types of indicators: implementation (or monitoring) indicators and \ndevelopmental result (or evaluation) indicators. As illustrated in Appendix 2, the implementation \nindicators comprise three categories: (i) fund use, (ii) scheduling, and (iii) construction quality. \nHowever, little thinking was given to indicators for measuring developmental results during \nconstruction and upon operation (para. 11). \n \n6.  The primary focus of the M&E system is on fighting corruption and promoting good \ngovernance in public investments. The system will support the work of the central KPIO\u2019s 80 \nproject inspectors and the 800 project inspectors at the provincial and/or municipal level. These \n880 inspectors monitor more than 10,000 state-level key projects5 and many  more at the \nprovincial and municipal levels. The real-time system will help improve the effectiveness of the \nmonitoring by providing early warnings on potential problems related to implementation. At this \ntime, KPIOs are mostly reacting to problems that already occurred and, in most cases, damage \nthat was already incurred. Furthermore, a properly constructed system will serve as a tool for \nresult-based  project  management  and  provide  feedback  for  future  project  design  and \nimplementation. Appendix 2 provides more descriptions on how the system will help inspectors \nand  policy  makers  identify  potential  corruption  at  early  stages  and  provide  useful  policy \nfeedback.  \n \n7.  The strong ownership of the M&E system by NDRC was made evident by the fact that \nNDRC  took  major  initiatives  and  invested  a  significant  amount  of  its  own  resources  in \ndeveloping the system. However, NDRC still lacks hands-on experience in developing a result-\n                                                 \n4  ADB also provided a regional TA, TA 6096 (ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for Supporting the Sector Approach \nand  Result-Based  Management  in  Operations.  Manila).  The  regional  TA  covered  PRC,  Kyrgyz  Republic, \nPhilippines, and Sri Lanka. Its goal was to improve the capacity to implement sectorwide result-based management \nprocesses in these countries. The activities included conducting training programs and pilot case studies that \ninvolved applying the result-based management approaches to sector planning and projects. More than 80 KPIO \nstaff members were trained under the TA.  \n5 The state-level key projects include (i) projects that receive state funding (regardless of the size of the projects), (ii) \ninfrastructure projects (even without state funding), and (iii) projects that receive foreign funding. \n ", "      3\nbased system, which represents a major methodological and practical challenge. Additional \ninternational expertise, especially in the area of selecting and testing result indicators, would be \nparticularly beneficial.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n8.  As indicated in Appendix 1, the intended impact or goal of the advisory TA is less \ncorruption and better development results from the key projects. The intended outcome or \npurpose  is  the  provision  of  detailed  and  reliable  information  related  to  key  project \nimplementation  and  operational  results  to  KPIOs,  project  executing  agencies,  and \nimplementation enterprises on a regular and real-time basis. The key outputs of the TA will be \n(i) a submodule on developmental result indicators (i.e., outcome and impact) in the result-\nbased M&E system for key projects (being developed by NDRC using computerized networks \nand technologies) and (ii) trained staff members. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  In view of the progress made in overall system development and the weaknesses of the \nsystem  currently  being  developed,  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  focus  on  the  following  areas:  (i) \nreviewing the structure of the M&E system and types (sectors) of national key projects and \ninstitutional capacities, with respect to data collection for the indicators; (ii) identifying simple \nand  measurable  developmental  result  indicators  for  main  sectors  in  consultation  with  key \nstakeholders;  (iii)  testing  the  indicators  on  actual  projects  for  selected  sectors,  to  assess \nusefulness  and  measurability;  (iv)  integrating  selected  indicators  into  the  M&E  system;  (v) \npreparing lectures and training manuals covering the development and use of developmental \nresult indicators and data collection and updating; and (vi) conducting domestic training and \nseminars and international exchanges. \n \n10.  Some  difficulties  will  be  experienced  in  devising,  testing,  and  implementing  result \nindicators. These difficulties vary from sector to sector and project to project. The measurement \nof such indicators is inevitably complex. Many older key projects that will be included in the \nsystem may have no clearly defined development objectives or goals, let alone indicators. \nInclusion of developmental result indicators in the system requires (i) defining such goals and/or \nobjectives (at least for all new projects and possibly for existing projects); (ii) selecting and \ntesting  some  simple  and  measurable  indicators;  and  (iii)  collecting  information  for  these \nindicators before and during project implementation (the baseline or without project scenario) \nand at project completion or, for a sample of the projects, during ex post evaluation (with project \nscenario). Project implementation enterprises and executing agencies may not possess the \nnecessary expertise and resources for collecting the information required, and many will view \ndata gathering as an additional cost that does not support project implementation management \nand operations. Focusing on simplicity and measurability is the key for the system\u2019s long-term \nsustainability.  The  issue  of  who  (e.g.,  project  executing  agencies,  project  implementation \nenterprises,  construction  companies,  or  KPIOs)  is  responsible  for  paying  the  costs  and \ncollecting  the  information  at  different  phases  of  project  implementation,  completion,  and \noperation must be addressed through the TA.  \n \n11.  The  developmental  result  indicators  will  cover  implementation  (e.g.,  employment \ncreation,  income  generation,  and  impact  on  the  environment  during  construction)  and \noperations. The operational results will be further captured at two levels, namely outcome or ", "4     \npurpose-level indicators and impact or goal-level indicators. Table 1 provides several examples \nof such indicators. \n \nTable 1: Examples of Developmental Result Indicators \n \nSector  Outcome or Purpose-Level Indicators Impact or Goal-Level Indicators \n     \nElectric Power  Increased power supply, reduced power  Increased business opportunities \noutages, or more reliable power supply  and income due to the cheaper or \nmore reliable supply of electricity \n \nRoads and/or  Reduction of travel time and costs,  Increased income due to faster, less \nExpressways  increased cargo and passenger traffic  costly, and more reliable access to \nmarkets and supplies \n \nWastewater Treatment  Increased wastewater treatment level,  Improved health because of lower \nincreased water tariffs, improved water  incidence of waterborne diseases  \nquality  \n     \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \n12.  A set of developmental result indicators will be identified for major sectors covered by \nthe  key  projects.  About  5  Case  studies  will  be  conducted  for  selected  key  projects  to \ndemonstrate  how  to  use  sampling  and  survey  approaches,  including  the  rapid  appraisal \napproach based on quick and easy surveys, and existing official survey information for indicator \ncalibration. For impact or goal-level indicators, in addition to the sector-specific indicators shown \nin  the  examples  in  Table  1,  a  nominal  indexing  system  will  be  developed,  namely,  the \ndevelopment goal achievement index. This index measures, on a scale of 0 to 5, the extent to \nwhich the various underlying long-term development goals of key projects were or will be \nachieved. The index development and calibration will involve value judgment based on actual \nqualitative and quantitative indicators. The main advantage of such an index is that it allows \ncomparisons of the achievement of different development goals by different key projects and \nover different time periods. To carry out case studies, the consultants will work with 15\u201320 staff \nmembers from KPIOs and the executing agencies or project implementation enterprises of the \nkey projects selected (preferably including some ADB-financed projects) for pilot testing. The \nconsultants  will  provide  hands-on  training  to  and  conduct  train-the-trainer  sessions  for \nparticipating staff members.  \n \n13.    Learning  a  lesson  from  the  earlier  TA  projects,  cost-effectiveness  will  be  a  key \nconsideration when conducting domestic training and seminars and international exchanges. \nThe domestic training will comprise training of no less than 100 staff members from selected \nkey project executing agencies; selected project implementation enterprises; and central and \nprovincial KPIOs, including but not confined to those from the 13 provinces selected for the pilot \ntesting of the M&E system. The 15\u201320 staff members trained through the case studies and the \ntrain-the-trainer  sessions  will  play  a  key  role  in  the  training  activities  by  sharing  their \nexperiences with the participants. The training will focus on the application of developmental \nresult indicators in monitoring and evaluating key projects using the M&E system. The TA will \nalso finance international exchanges, by inviting international experts to the PRC and/or sending \na small number of key personnel involved in developing and applying the M&E system for \ninternational training in priority areas of project monitoring and evaluation jointly defined by \nADB, consultants, and KPIOs.  \n \n ", "      5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent, consisting of $300,000 in \nforeign exchange cost and $200,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. ADB will provide $400,000 equivalent to finance \nthe entire foreign exchange cost and part of the local cost of the TA. The Government will \nfinance  the  remaining  $100,000  equivalent  local  currency  cost,  covering  office  space, \ncounterpart services, translation, and domestic transport (see Appendix 3). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Executing Agency of the TA will be the KPIO of NDRC. A steering committee, \nconsisting of representatives from Ministry of Finance, NDRC, and State Council, will provide \npolicy-level guidance. The KPIO will appoint one of its senior staff members to be the project \nmanager, and this person will head a taskforce comprising focal persons from the participating \nprovincial KPIOs. The consulting team will include three international (8 person-months) and \nthree domestic (11 person-months) consultants with matching expertise. A domestic consultant \nwill act as TA coordinator and assist in monitoring and coordinating TA implementation. The \nterms of reference for consultants are given in Appendix 4. The consultants will be engaged by \nADB as individual consultants in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by \nAsian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. Priority will be given to engaging domestic consultants \nengaged by the KPIO (i.e., Tsinghua University and Investment Engineering) for developing the \nM&E system, to ensure the continuity of the work. KPIO will be responsible for providing the \nrequired logistical support, including provision of office space, office support facilities, materials, \nand  equipment.  If  any  need  arises  for  procuring  additional  TA  equipment,  KPIO  will  be \nresponsible for procuring the equipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement \nand with prior clearance from ADB. The ownership of the equipment will rest with KPIO at the \ncompletion  of  the  TA.  KPIO  will  make  domestic  travel  and  meeting  arrangements  for \nconsultants,  translate  necessary  documents,  and  provide  any  other  inputs  necessary  for \neffective TA implementation. \n \n16.  The TA will commence in June 2005 and be completed in December 2006. The project \nmanager, assisted by the TA coordinator and the international result-based project management \nspecialist, will submit to the steering committee and ADB (i) an inception report within 6 weeks \nof TA commencement, (ii) an interim report for the consideration of the midterm review in April \n2006, and (iii) a final report in December 2006. In addition, the project manager will prepare \nshort quarterly progress reports and separate briefing reports for all the major training activities. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Developing a Result-Based National \nMonitoring and Evaluation System for Key Projects, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Source and/or \nPerformance Indicators  Monitoring  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  and Targets  Mechanisms  Risks \n       \nImpact       \nLess corruption and  Losses from corruption in the  Project monitoring and   Assumptions \nbetter developmental  key projects reduced by 20%  evaluation activities by  \u2022 Strong commitment by \nresults from the key  within 3 years of the technical  key projects  KPIOs to use the \nprojects  assistance (TA) completion  inspectorate offices  monitoring and evaluation \n(baseline to be determined as a  (KPIOs), including  (M&E) system to improve \npart of the TA)  project completion  auditing and inspection \n  reports and  for fighting corruption and \nNumber of prosecution cases  postevaluation of  improving developmental \nrelated to corruption in key  selected key projects    results \nprojects increased by 10%,    \u2022 Strict and sustained \nwithin 3 years of TA completion  Official statistics and  enforcement of \n(baseline to be determined as a  KPIOs\u2019 estimates  anticorruption laws \npart of the TA)    \u2022 Significant feedback from \n  Self-reporting by key  the M&E system is used \nAverage project delay reduced  project executing  by National Development \nby 10%, within 3 years of TA  agencies through the  and Reform Commission \ncompletion (baseline to be  M&E system  (NDRC) for improving \ndetermined as a part of the TA)    macroeconomic policy \n  Possible TA  conditions and new \nAverage cost overrun reduced  performance audit  project formulation and \nby 10%, within 3 years of TA  report mission   implementation \ncompletion  (baseline to be   \ndetermined as a part of the TA)  Risks \n  \u2022 Anti-corruption program \nEstimated average capacity use  is not successful \nof the key projects 2 years after \n\u2022 Information provided by \ncommissioning improves by \nthe system is not used for \n10%, within 3 years of TA \ndecision making \ncompletion (baseline to be \n\u2022 The system is not \ndetermined as a part of the TA) \nfinancially sustainable \n \ndespite proposed \ncharges \n \nOutcome       \nDetailed and reliable  The result-based M&E system  Regular  Assumptions \ninformation related to key  is operational at TA completion  correspondence  \u2022 Adequate staff and \nproject implementation  and contains regularly updated  between Asian  budgetary resources for \nand operational results  and accurate data for indicators,  Development Bank  regular data collection \navailable to KPIOs,  such as fund use, scheduling,  (ADB) and KPIO  and updating \nproject executing  quality of construction, capacity  during TA  \u2022 Stringent data quality \nagencies, and project  use  and development impact  implementation  control and checking \nimplementation  for the key projects included in     \nenterprises on a regular  the system  TA completion mission  Risks \nand real-time basis      \u2022 Some project executing \n    agencies and \n  implementation \n  enterprises may falsify \n  data and make data input \n  errors \n \n ", "    Appendix 1  7 \n \nData Source and/or \nPerformance Indicators  Monitoring  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  and Targets  Mechanisms  Risks \n       \n      \u2022 Information for \ndevelopmental indicators \nis not collected due to \nhigh costs or low priority \nas perceived by the \nproject implementation \nagencies \n \nOutputs       \n1.

As indicated by Figure A1, the system consists of information systems at three different \nlevels i.e., project site supervision system, provincial and/or municipal information systems (at \nthe provincial and/or municipal development and reform commissions [DRCs]) and the central \nsystem (at the National Development and Reform Commission [NDRC]). At the project level, \nproject  information  is  gathered  and  entered  into  the  system  by  project  implementation \nenterprises (i.e., self-reporting). Stringent quality control mechanisms will be implemented for \ndata input, to minimize data input errors and data falsification through cross-checking with other \ndata sources. The project-level data will be subject to checking from project supervision entities \nand  project  inspectors  from  provincial  and  central  KPIOs.  The  information  will  consist  of \nindicators related to project implementation (i.e., monitoring indicators) and project results, with \nrespect  to  the  achievement  of  the  development  objectives  and  goals  of  the  projects  (i.e., \nevaluation indicators). The monitoring indicators comprise three categories: (i) investment (fund \nuse), (ii) project scheduling, and (iii) construction quality. However, as indicated by the dashed \nboxes in the flowchart, insufficient consideration was given to devising evaluation indicators \nrelated to project results (including before and during project construction [e.g., baseline] and \nupon  completion  and  operation)  or  which  agency  will  be  responsible  for  collecting  the \ninformation required. NDRC recognizes the importance of having evaluation indicators but lacks \nexpertise and experience in developing indicators that are measurable and useful for evaluating \nthe achievement of development goals. \n \n2.  Once  entered,  the  project-level  monitoring  data  are  automatically  uploaded  to  the \ninformation systems at the provincial and/or municipal and central levels through secured data \ntransmission  links  using  either  NDRC  intranet  or  internet.  The  information  systems  at  the \nprovincial and/or municipal and central levels will automatically read data from project-level \nsystems and perform data aggregation, tabulation, and analyses. Based on the implementation \nand result indicators that will provide early warning for potential problems, such as serious cost \noverruns or implementation delays or poor construction quality, which may indicate potential \ncorruption and frauds, project inspectors from the central or provincial levels may choose to \ninspect those potential problem projects to obtain more details as to the causes. The flowchart \nillustrates three typical projects. The two projects on the sides are potential problem projects \nthat will be inspected by provincial and central KPIOs, respectively. The middle project is \nsatisfactory and thus will not be inspected. Based on feedback and information, NDRC may \nchoose  to  adjust  macroeconomic  policies  to  influence  future  project  formulation, \nimplementation, and performance to achieve better development results. One of the products \nthat  the  M&E  system  generates  is  a  credit  rating  system  related  to  the  compliance  with \ncontracts and general performance of all enterprises and businesses that participated in the \nimplementation of key projects. The rating will provide useful feedback for future project bidding \nand procurement.  \n \n3.

International and domestic consultants will have sound knowledge of and hands-on \nexperience  in  project  management,  as  well  as  experience  in  developing  and  using \ndevelopmental result indicators. The consultants will have working knowledge of the operation \nand maintenance of several key types of infrastructure projects, including energy (particularly \npower)  projects,  road  and/or  expressway  projects,  industry  projects,  and  environment \nimprovement projects. The domestic consultant must be able to speak, read, and write in \nEnglish at an adequate level.  \n \n2.  The main tasks are to \n \n(i)  Review the structure of the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system currently \nbeing developed and the institutional framework and capacities of the key project \nexecuting  agencies,  project  implementation  enterprises,  and  key  projects \ninspectorate offices (KPIOs) at the national and provincial levels, with respect to \ntheir general understanding of M&E and data collection capabilities.  \n \n(ii)  Cluster all the key projects into sectors that will form the basis for the subsequent \ndevelopment  of  result  indicators.  In  consultation  with  the  key  stakeholders, \ndetermine  a  set  of  priority  sectors  that  will  be  the  focus  of  the  technical \nassistance (TA) in terms of indictor development and testing based on pilot \nprojects. \n \n(iii)  Identify a set of simple and measurable sector-specific result indicators for all the \nsectors clustered under (ii), in consultation with key stakeholders. The result \nindicators  will  include  implementation  result  indicators  and  operation  result \nindicators. The former refers to indicators for socioeconomic and other results \nduring construction (e.g., employment creation, income generation, and impact \non the environment). The latter refers to indicators for the results brought out by \nthe operations of the projects upon completion. The results may be captured at \ntwo different levels: the outcome or purpose level and the impact or goal level. \nFor example, the outcome indicators for a power project may be reduction of \npower outages and more reliable power supply, and the impact indicators would \ninclude  downstream  impact  from  the  additional  and  more  reliable  electricity \nsupplies (e.g., increased economic opportunities due to the cheaper or more \nreliable supply of electricity).     \n  \n(iv)  Devise, based on the sector-specific outcome and impact indicators developed \nunder  (iii),  a  nominal  index  system  tentatively  named  the  development  goal \nachievement index, which is comparable across sectors and can be aggregated \nto derive an overall measure for comparing the achievement of development \ngoals by the key projects across different sectors and over different time periods.  \n \n(v)  Provide guiding inputs to the international and domestic sampling and survey \nspecialists  on  selecting  sectors  and  specific  projects  for  pilot  testing  the \nindicators  and  design  specific  methodologies  for  the  sampling  and  survey \nspecialists to conduct a rapid survey to collect necessary data for the indicators.
