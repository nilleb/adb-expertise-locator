INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will strengthen water governance \nprocesses at the river basin level so that lessons learned can be scaled up and applied across \nMongolia and other river basins in the region. The TA will support capacity building primarily \nthrough training, learning by doing, knowledge sharing, and pilot testing small-scale interventions. \nThe TA will analyze lessons learned and prepare them as recommendations to support longer-\nterm institutional and policy reforms. The TA is designed to bring significant changes to the \napproach to planning and managing water sector investments at the river basin level across \nMongolia. It will improve the effectiveness and sustainability of water sector investments and \ninfrastructure to provide socio-economic benefits.1  \n \n2.  The  TA  is  consistent  with  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2017\u20132020  of the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for Mongolia.2 It will complement efforts of the Ministry of Environment \nand Tourism (MET) to implement its responsibilities in the water sector, underpinned by the \nMongolia  Sustainable  Development  Vision  2030.3 It  builds  on  ADB\u2019s  country  water  security \nassessment  (CWSA), the  MET\u2019s  Integrated Water  Management  Plan  for  Mongolia,  and  the \nUlaanbaatar 2020 Master Plan and Development Approaches for 2030.4 The TA converges with \nADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, which aims to enhance water governance and resilience to water-\nrelated disaster risks and the capacity for climate change adaptability of developing member \ncountries.5 The TA is proposed in ADB\u2019s 2017 firm pipeline.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Long-term  sustainable  and  inclusive  growth  in  Mongolia  is  heavily  reliant  on  the \nmanagement of its natural resources, but rapid socio-economic developments in the country put \nsevere pressure on these resources. Hence, effective investments in the water sector are needed \nto support economic growth, health and well-being, livelihoods, environmental sustainability, and \ndisaster resilience. Each of these presents significant challenges in planning and implementation. \nMoreover, Mongolia is already seeing impacts from climate change in terms of temperature and \nprecipitation  patterns,  putting  further  pressure  on  degraded  grasslands  and  poor  livestock \npractices. Increased evaporation from higher temperatures and greater variability in precipitation \nmay  cause  a  decrease  in  river  water  levels,  higher  seasonal  variations,  and  a  decline  in \ngroundwater levels because of decreased recharge. \n \n4.  The Government of Mongolia has made significant progress in improving its legal and \ninstitutional framework for integrated water resource management (IWRM) and the environmental \nprotection of river basins. In 2010, Mongolia was divided into 29 river basins. By introducing the \nconcepts of river basin organizations (RBOs),7 which consists of river basin councils (RBCs) and \nriver basin authorities (RBAs), paved the way for decentralization and community involvement in \nwater governance. The Water Law of 2012 serves as an umbrella law for water management8 and \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 November 2017. \n2  ADB. 2017.

Ulaanbaatar.    \n ", "2 \nprovided an IWRM framework, under which RBAs were established.9 Given limited resources and \nlack of capacity, only 21 of the proposed 29 RBOs were established to support preparation of river \nbasin management (RBM) plans and implement these through multi-stakeholder consultation. \n \n5.  Existing government policies emphasize that the mining sector is a key driver of national \neconomic development. Extensive water-intensive mining activities have begun to induce regional \neconomic  development  restructuring and  influence  demographics  in  Mongolia,  increasing \nenvironmental and water security risks. Mongolia\u2019s future development rests heavily on how it \nmanages  its  water  resources,  and  moving  toward  energy  and  food  security  will  require  a \nconsiderable amount of its scarce water resources. Urbanization and population growth, disaster risk \nmismanagement, and development projects, may lead to unsustainable water use and conflicts \namong users. ADB\u2019s CWSA for Mongolia highlights that proper policies and planning, adaptation \nstrategies, and mitigation measures for climate change need to be established at the river basin level, \nespecially given the localized water stress situation in Mongolia. Managing Mongolia\u2019s rising energy \nand food security challenges and demands\u2014particularly for river basins with significant mining, \nhydropower and agriculture activity\u2014will make water management even more critical in supporting \nsocio-economic development. \n \n6.  The government needs to overcome several institutional challenges to strengthen IWRM \nin Mongolia, including: (i) limited intergovernmental and local-level government (aimag and \nsoum)10 coordination; (ii) insufficient mandate and capacity of the RBOs themselves to effectively \naddress  the  challenges    and  work  with  central  and  provincial  governments;  (iii)  lagging \ndevelopment of the parallel RBCs; (iv) lack of stakeholder coordination through RBCs; (v) \ninsufficient data collection, monitoring, and management (dispersed and poorly managed); (vi) \nlack of resources, such as a competent cadre of technical staff and finances, for effective water \nmanagement execution; and (vii) inefficient water management tools and little consideration for \nalternative models for more effective water management.    \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  To overcome the above challenges, solutions are needed in three areas: (i) reform of river \nbasin institutional setting and policies; (ii) strengthening of river basin administrations; and (iii) \nriver basin planning and implementation of on-ground actions. The TA is aligned with the following \nimpact: climate change and water-related disasters in Mongolia improved. The TA will have the \nfollowing outcome: water sector planning and management in select river basin strengthened. \nThe TA will have three outputs.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n8.  Output 1: River basin policy recommendations prepared. The TA will implement the \nfollowing components under this output: (i) support the development of summary sheets and a \nguidance manual for the updated water law (currently being updated) and its related regulations; (ii) \nassess and provide recommendations for clearer RBO mandates, incentives for RBAs to implement \ntheir plans, and actions for increased RBC empowerment; (iii) support the establishment of select \n                                                \n9  As of 2017, Government of Mongolia\u2019s Ministry of Environment under the Water Lawn has established RBAs for 23 \nout of the 29 river basins. \n10 An aimag is an administrative division that is generally equivalent to a province, while a soum is an administrative \nsubunit of an aimag that is generally equivalent to a district. \n11  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \nRBCs and the preparation of their by-laws; (iv) provide recommendations for establishing closer \nlinks with local governments (environmental agencies at aimags) to avoid duplication of efforts \nbetween local government and RBOs, and to coordinate efforts; and (v) study and assess different \nRBO models, including a more corporate hybrid model, and review the current RBO structure to \npropose potential consolidation of RBOs on the basis of administrative boundaries. Through this \noutput,  the  TA  will  aim  to  assess  the  current  water  governance  situation  and  provide \nrecommendations for legislative and institutional reform and policy recommendations. \n \n9.  Output 2: Capacity building program for river basin administration strengthened \nand delivered. The TA will conduct the following activities under this output: (i) train RBA, RBC, \nline ministry, institute, and local government staff; (ii) develop a scoring system to assess the \nstatus of river basins, including by (a) simplifying the Asian Water Development Outlook approach \nand application; (b) developing a World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Basin Report Card for the Tuul River \nBasin;12 and (c) conducting water accounting in the Tuul River Basin and training staff to use tools \nto monitor and make decisions on sustainable water management, climate change adaptability, \nand disaster risk management;13 and (iii) review and upgrade the existing state water database \nsystem for better centralized data collection and interaction between RBOs and the MET. \n \n10.  Output 3: Actions and approaches for better river basin management implemented. \nThe TA will conduct the following activities under this output: (i) develop RBM plans;14 (ii) support the \nupdating of the Orkhon and Tuul RBM plans;15 (iii) prioritize and implement key actions in the RBM \nplan; (iv) design and pilot test16 approaches for water security in select river basins for (a) improved \nwater quality monitoring, (b) participatory irrigation management, (c) management of community \nwater supply and sanitation scheme, (d) groundwater recharge technologies and monitoring,17 (e) \nflood risk management interventions, and (f) better implementation of water and pollution fees; (v) \nassess the success and potential scale-up and replication of the pilot tests; and (vi) develop a small \nprogram for further interventions and investments based on the successful pilot tests. \n \n11.  The TA outputs will support and strengthen the implementation of integrated river basin \ngovernance. In the context of climate change, enhanced river basin planning and management is \nkey to sustaining livelihoods and economic growth. An integrated approach to better understand \npriority uses and responses to water-related disasters needs to be applied. There is scope for high-\nlevel technology application, particularly for water accounting in the Tuul River using remote sensing \n                                                \n12 World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is developing, packaging, and sharing a process that helps stakeholders create science-\nbased report cards in their own basins with the right buy-in on-the-ground and credibility globally. ADB, MET, and \nWWF have selected the Tuul river basin as a pilot area for its size and importance for the country, as agreed between \npartners. There is a possibility to extend the pilot to include up to two more river basins.  \n13  Water accounting is the process of communicating water resources-related information and the services generated \nfrom consumptive use in a geographical domain, such as a river basin, a country, or a land-use class to users such \nas policy-makers, water authorities, managers, etc. \n14 Based on consultations and collaborations with RBOs, RBAs, RBCs, and local governments.  \n15  All plans should be for 5 years and will be revisited and updated every 5 years. \n16  ADB. 2017. Compendium of Staff Instructions. Business Processes for Knowledge and Support Technical Assistance. \nAttachment 1 on Optional Provisions. Manila. In line with Attachment 1 on Optional Provisions of the Staff Instructions on \nBusiness Processes for Knowledge and Support Technical Assistance, (i) the pilot testing amount will not exceed 30% \nof the estimated ADB financing amount; (ii) activities will not result in any potential adverse environmental and/or social \nimpacts and will be classified category C for the social and environment safeguards; (iii) goods, services, and works \nrequired for the pilot testing will be listed in a procurement plan to be prepared in the TA report; and (iv) arrangements for \npilot testing sites, permits and clearances, and treatment of assets are agreed between ADB and the executing agency \nprior to TA approval. \n17  An application of $400,000 has been put in for SDCC\u2019s High-Level Technology fund for the groundwater recharge \nand monitoring pilot. If the application is approved, the funds will be piggy-backed on to this TA and the TA firm will \nalso manage these funds which are specifically to be used to implement HLT for the ground water pilot activity. \n ", "4 \nand  geographic  information  system  to  establish  water  allocations.  Modern  communication \ntechnology will improve the efficiency of the institutions involved.  \n \n12.  Given its capacity building nature, the TA approach is appropriate for delivering targeted \noutputs under ADB\u2019s guidance and bringing expert knowledge from ADB. The TA modality allows \nADB the degree of administrative and technical supervision needed for a national TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.   The TA is estimated to cost $1,010,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) and administered by ADB. The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. The government will provide counterpart support in the \nform of RBO office space, salaries and travel costs of TA management unit and counterpart staff, and \nother in-kind contributions.18  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  TA duration will be 2.5 years with implementation period to begin in January 2018. ADB will \nadminister the TA, and the MET will be the executing agency. MET will establish a TA management \nunit in the MET\u2019s Green Development Policy and Planning Department; the TA management unit \nwill work closely with the river basin division.19 MET will establish a TA steering committee at MET \nwith the MET vice minister or secretary as chair, and representation from cross-sector ministries, \nincluding the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Light Industry; the Ulaanbaatar city government; and \nthe Tuul RBA. The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  January 2018\u2013June 2020 \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Environment and Tourism \nImplementing agency  Green Development Policy and Planning Department \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Firm: QCBS, SSS  Consulting firm  $800,000, $80,000 \nIndividual: ICS  International, 3 person- $75,000 \nmonths  \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICS = individual consultant selection, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, SSS \n= single-source selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n15.  Consulting services. ADB will engage a firm or an entity for overall TA implementation, \nand will engage an international water resources specialist, who will also serve as the team leader, \nand an international institutional water management and capacity development specialist under \nthe firm for TA implementation. The firm will propose other specialists and the overall composition \nof the consulting team. ADB will engage the firm or entity following the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or \nstaff instructions using quality- and cost-based selection with quality-cost ratio of 90:10 and \nsimplified technical proposal.20 This is the most appropriate method considering the complex \nnature of the TA and the technical expertise required to pilot test the approaches.  \n                                                \n18  Office space in Ulaanbaatar will not be covered under counterpart funds given the current fiscal situation in Mongolia.  \n19 With support from the Climate Change and International Cooperation Department of MET. \n20 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). To reduce \nadministrative burden and improve economy, efficiency, and value for money, ADB will engage all consulting services \non output-based (lump-sum) contracts. \n ", "5 \n16.  ADB will engage specialists through WWF Mongolia for the application of the WWF Basin \nReport Card tool using single-source selection. Individual consultant selection will be used as this \nis a specialized tool designed by WWF and only WWF can implement it.    \n \n17.  ADB will engage specialists through the IHE Delft Institute for Water Education, under an \nexisting TA, for the application of water accounting tools and training of national and local \ngovernment officials using single-source selection.21 The water accounting tool and approach can \nonly be carried out by IHE Delft Institute for Water Education.  \n \n18.  The TA will follow standard monitoring and supervision procedures for ADB administered TA. \nThe TA team will disseminate best practices and lessons through technical workshops and technical \nreports, knowledge products, and other publications posted on the websites of the MET and ADB. \n \n19.  Pilot testing of project approach. Under the TA, the consulting team will test small \nlocalized pilot project initiatives for designing and demonstrating the application and use of water \nsecurity approaches and ideas. The project will design, implement, and assess these for future \nscale up and replication. The potential pilot sites will be based on the results of the country water \nsecurity assessment and will likely include the Kharaa-Eruu, Orkhon-Chuluut, Tuul, and Uvs river \nbasins given competing water uses and complex water governance issues. The consulting team \nwill  develop  additional  criteria  for  pilot  site  selection  during  the  inception  phase  of  TA \nimplementation,22 and assess the adequacy and viability of technical solutions and compatibility \nwith local conditions for the pilot approaches during TA implementation. The activities in para. 10 \nwill not result in any potential adverse environmental and/or social impacts and follow Attachment \n1 on Optional Provisions of the Staff Instructions on Business Processes for Knowledge and \nSupport Technical Assistance (footnote 16). \n \n20.
