To provide relevant information and analysis, to contribute to the intellectual environment \nin which policy formulation occurs, and to maintain and enhance its reputation as a credible and \nauthoritative  source  of  knowledge  about  the  region,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nregularly monitors and offers commentary on evolving developments in its developing member \ncountries (DMCs). The Asian Development Outlook1 (ADO) is the principal vehicle for delivery \nof these services regionwide.  The content of ADO also informs Management opinion and \nguides institutional views about prospective developments and other important issues. ADO has \nbeen a flagship publication of ADB since 1989.  The preparation, publication, and dissemination \nof ADO has been regularly supported by technical assistance (TA) funding.  Appendix 1 sets out \nthe objectives, scope, and activities to be covered by the regional TA.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Ongoing  efforts  to  improve  the  quality  of  ADO  are  focused  on  providing  stronger \nanalytical content and ensuring better cohesion and balance among its parts. These initiatives \nrespond to feedback from clients and to a changing environment and market for economic \ninformation  and  analysis.  Efforts  to  improve  the  quality  of  analysis  will  include  the \ncommissioning of relevant applied and policy research at a country and regional level, the \ndevelopment of new sources of information, and strengthened peer review. In an increasingly \ncompetitive market for knowledge and information, high-quality editing services are critical to \nensure that ADO\u2019s key messages are communicated effectively.  The Economics and Research \nDepartment (ERD) will continue to work with ADB\u2019s Department of External Relations (DER) to \nincrease ADO\u2019s regional and international reach. \n \n3.  The TA will support activities that will contribute to high-quality content and help ensure \nthe usefulness and relevance of ADO to policy dialogue and formulation in DMCs. Currently, \nADO is the most frequently downloaded publication from ADB\u2019s website and is directly or \nindirectly the source of much international and national news commentary that features analysis, \nviews, and opinions from ADB.  Elevating ADO\u2019s profile further and widening its influence will \nrequire a concerted effort not just to improve quality but to differentiate and disseminate content. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n4.  The main outputs from the TA will be ADO 2007 and ADO 2007 Update. Activities \nsupported under the TA will also feed into the preparation of subsequent years\u2019 ADOs.  Draft \ncontents pages of ADO 2007 and ADO 2007 Update are in Appendix 2. The major thematic \nfocus in 2007 will be on the links between Asia\u2019s structural transformation and new growth \npatterns. It is expected that related issues will feature in many country chapters and will be \ncovered at a regional and subregional level in Parts 1 and 3.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The Asian Development Outlook (ADO) is sold externally, and is extensively reviewed and commented on in \nthe media. It is also the most popular document on the ADB website. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 26 July 2006. \n ", "2   \n5.  The TA will further develop and refine analytical methods to support ADB\u2019s short- and \nmedium-term country economic monitoring and reporting.  The methods will also strengthen the \neconomic underpinnings of country programs and strategies for the DMCs covered. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  The key activities to be supported by the TA will include: preparation of background \nanalytical papers; further development and refinement of analytical methods; drafting of ADO \ncontent; economic and copy editing; and preparation and layout of materials for publication. In \naddition, the TA will finance the procurement of information and knowledge services that may be \nrequired to support high-quality and up-to-date content and will support workshops, seminars, \nand training activities that are directly relevant to the preparation and strengthening of ADO and \nits dissemination. \n \n7.  The  terms  of  reference  of  background  analytical  papers  will  be  prepared  by  the \nMacroeconomics  and  Finance  Research  Division  (ERMF)  in  consultation  with  operations \ndepartments, as relevant. The objective of the papers will be to provide solid empirical and \nanalytical foundation for ADO content.    \n \n8.  Economic  and  copy  editing  activities  will  be  provided  by  international  consultants \nworking  under  the  direction  of  the  assistant  chief  economist,  ERMF.  High-quality  editing \nservices are crucial to ensure accuracy, coherence, and consistency in approach across the \ndifferent chapters and parts of ADO. \n \n9.  Training activities will focus on macroeconomic analysis, growth accounting, economic \nprojections, and effective writing skills. Training will target economists in regional departments, \nnational officers in resident missions, and, as appropriate, government officials and other client \ngroups. The objective of the training is to equip writers with the skills and the tools needed to \ncraft high-quality country chapters. Training will also impart skills that are of broader relevance \nfor economic and sector work that underpins country strategies. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $380,000 (Appendix 3). The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  ADB will be the Executing Agency responsible for implementing and monitoring the TA.  \nIn particular, ERMF will implement the TA in close collaboration with regional departments (RDs, \ne.g., Central and West Asia, East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Pacific) and resident \nmissions (RMs). The assistant chief economist of ERMF, reporting to the chief economist of \nERD, will be responsible for implementation. Given the high institutional profile of ADO, ERD will \nreport to the Vice-President, Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development Group and \nto the President at critical points in its preparation. \n \n12.  Developing analytical approaches and tools to support high-quality ADO content will be \na collaborative effort involving ERMF economists, country economists of the RDs and RMs,   \nnational experts, international consultants, and economics editors. The TA will finance the \nprocurement of information and knowledge services as may be required to support relevant and \nup-to-date content.  Procurement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n ", "  3\n(April 2006, as amended from time to time). The TA is expected to start in December 2006 and \nto be completed by December 2007. \n \n13.  An ADO writers\u2019 workshop for the country chapter writers and a workshop on Part 3 of \nADO 2008 are tentatively scheduled for November 2007 at ADB headquarters.  The workshop \non Part 3 will present the topic of the theme chapter for the subsequent year\u2019s ADO, and will \ndiscuss issues and directions for the theme chapter.   \n \n14.  For  ADO  2007  and  ADO  2007  Update,  it  is  estimated  that  10  person-months \n(approximately 5 consultants) of international consultants\u2019 time will be required for economic \nand technical editing of ADO manuscripts before final publication. ADO will also require 5 \nperson-months  (approximately  2  consultants)  of  international  consultancy  resources  for \npreparing  background  papers.  Another  6  person-months  (approximately  2  consultants)  of \nnational economic consultants\u2019 time will be required to assist in preparing country chapters and \ndata sheets.  Appendix 4 gives the outline terms of reference for the consultants and resource \npersons. The consultants will be hired as individuals. Resource persons will also be engaged to \nconduct training workshops and prepare background papers on economic trends and prospects \nof selected DMCs.  ADB will engage the consultants and resource persons in accordance with \nits Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time). \n \n15.  ADB staff will disseminate the major results of ADO 2007 and ADO 2007 Update to the \nmedia,  DMC  policymakers,  and  civil  society.  The  TA  will  support  translation  of  ADO  into \nChinese  and  Russian  languages  to  extend  its  audience  in  selected  DMCs.    This  will  be \narranged by RDs in consultation with concerned RMs and DER. The dissemination activities will \nbe coordinated by DER in cooperation with ERMF. In selected DMCs, the RMs will undertake \nseparate launches and will be supported by ERMF. Both ADO 2007 and ADO 2007 Update will \nbe featured on the ADB website and printed copies will be distributed worldwide. In countries \nwhere there is limited broadband access, CD-ROMs will be made available through the RMs. \nERMF will work with DER to attempt to capture broader and more useful client feedback.   This \nactivity may require some limited TA resources.   \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $380,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Asian Development Outlook 2007, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 4  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \nInfluence the  Regional and  DER web download  \u2022  Key messages of ADO \nintellectual  international reach of  statistics  are communicated \nenvironment within  ADO      effectively. \nwhich policy  Media coverage and  Publicly available  \u2022  ADO reaches target \nformulation occurs  readership  citation data   audience in the policy \nand promote ADB\u2019s      and development \nreputation as an  Web downloads   ERMF/RD consultations  community. \nauthoritative and    with clients in country  \u2022  There is significant \nindependent source  ADO citation in major    degree of interest in \nof knowledge about  newspapers/publica- External review  DMC outlook. \nthe region.
