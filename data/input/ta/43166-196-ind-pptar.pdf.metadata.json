Consulting Services \n4  The State of West Bengal is on the threshold of a new era of industrialization. One of the \nmajor  infrastructural  requirements  of  industry  is  proper  road  connectivity.  In  this  regard, \nconnectivity  with  Haldia  port  is  of  paramount  importance.  The  existing  road  is  of  2-lane \nstandard. Geographically, this road section passes through the centroidal axis of West Bengal. \nThe districts situated along this alignment are Purba Medinipur, Paschim Medinipur, Hooghly, \nBardhaman, Birbhum and Murshidabad. Therefore, the development of this alignment would \nmaximize the effect of infrastructural development, economic growth and poverty reduction in \nthis area. This route, if developed to 4-lane standard, would enhance the transport to various \nmarket  places  of  local  agricultural  products  like  rice,  potato,  sesame,  jute  etc.,  which  are \nproduced in abundance in Hooghly, Bardhaman, Murshidabad, etc. \n \n5  ADB's project preparatory technical assistance will assist the Public Works (Roads) \nGovernment of West Bengal (GoWB) to undertake the following studies: \n \na.  Feasibility of the Proposed Project. The TA will establish the technical, environmental, \nsocial, economical, and financial viability of the project and prepare detailed project reports for \nrehabilitation and upgrading of the existing road to 2-lane with paved shoulders and / or 4 lane \ndivided carriageway configuration depending on the traffic levels, provision of new alignment, if \nrequired for better connectivity of the corridor and / or provision of bypasses. Traffic surveys, \norigin-destination surveys, pavement condition surveys and axle load surveys will be carried out \nfor this purpose.  \n \nb.  Detailed Engineering Design of the Proposed Project.  The TA will carry out the \ndetailed  engineering  design  of  the  project  including  detailed  highway  design,  design  of \npavement and overlay with options for flexible or rigid pavements, design of bridges and cross \ndrainage  structures  and  grade  separated  structures,  design  of  service  roads, quantities of \nvarious  items,  detailed  working  drawings,  detailed  cost  estimates,  economic  and  financial \nviability analyses, environmental and social feasibility, social and environmental action plans as \nappropriate  and  documents  required  for  tendering  the  project  on  commercial  basis  for \ninternational competitive bidding. This will entail, among other activities, detailed topographic \nsurveys,  pavement  investigations,  sub-grade  characteristics  and  strength:  investigation  of \nrequired sub-grade and subsoil characteristics and strength for road and embankment design \nand sub soil investigation; and hydraulic investigation for bridge design. \n \nc.  Preparation  of  Safeguard  Documents.  The  TA  will  prepare  initial  environmental \nexamination/  environmental  Impact  Assessment  Report  (as  appropriate)  including \nEnvironmental Management Plan (EMP), Resettlement Plan & Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) \nand indigenous peoples\u2019 safeguard documents (if required) conforming to the Guidelines of the \nGovernment of India, State Government and Asian Development Bank as appropriate for each \n ", "12  Appendix 4 \nconstruction package section. Appropriate social and environmental surveys will be carried out \nfor this purpose.  \n \nd.  Efficiency Assessment of Intermodal Connectivity. The TA will assess intermodal \nefficiency, including port operations and port road usage; and recommend measures to resolve \ninefficiencies including development of a risk assessment-based overloading control mechanism \nusing IT tools, which will allow the road and enforcement authorities to control overloading by \nmore precise targeting of suspect vehicles thus ensuring that port clearance times for vehicle \ntraffic is not affected while at the same time asset sustainability is ensured. Detailed surveys of \ncommodities/consigners/consignees at Haldia Port together with discussion with port, customs, \nand enforcement authorities will be necessary to develop this mechanism to improve efficiency \nin the port and port roads.  \n \ne.  Institutional Assessment of PWRD.  The TA will assess the institutional capacity of \nPWRD to carry out planning and programming of the state roads sector and recommend \nimprovements in systems, databases and procedures that are necessary to enable the PWRD \nto function as a modern road sector agency. The institutional assessment will also look into the \nmaintenance codes of practice and training needs that are necessary for this purpose.  \n \nTable A5.2: Summary of Consulting Services Requirement \nInternational  National \nName of Positions  Person-months  Name of Positions  Person-months \nTeam Leader/Senior Highway  8  Highway Engineer  8 \nEngineer  Pavement Specialist  3 \n    Bridge Engineer  5 \n    Traffic Engineer  3 \n    Material cum Geotechnical  6 \nEngineer \n    Senior Survey Engineer  5 \n    Quantity Surveyor /  4 \nDocumentation Expert   \n    Economist cum Financial Analyst  3 \n    Institutional  Specialist  3 \n    Overloading Control Specialist  2 \n    Environmental Specialist  4 \n    Resettlement Specialist  5 \n    Social Development Specialist              4 \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \n6  The outline terms of references (TOR) for the project preparatory TA consultants are \ndescribed in paras. 7 to 8.
