INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested policy and \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to study positive \nand negative factors and develop policy recommendations for enabling gradual rural\u2013urban \nmigration  and  urban  settlements  development  in  Chuxiong  Yi  Autonomous  Prefecture. \nChuxiong Prefecture is suitable for the study because of its (i) willingness to find solutions for \ninstitutional  barriers  to  gradual  rural\u2013urban  migration  and  urbanization  with  a  view  to \nimplementing  national  directives;  (ii)  experience  with  undertaking  a  similar  study;  and \n(iii) characteristics as being poor and a sender of rural migrants to more advanced regions and \nprovinces.  Following  a  fact-finding  mission  in  September  2016,  ADB  and  the  government \nreached an understanding on the TA objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, \nand terms of reference for consultants. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \nThe TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2016\u20132018 for the PRC.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The integration of rural migrants in urban areas as permanent urban residents is one of \nthe priorities to achieve \u201cpeople-oriented urbanization\u201d as set forth in the National Plan on New \nUrbanization (2014\u20132020) and the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020.3 This priority reflects \nthat the PRC lags behind in urbanization, compared to developed countries when they attained \nper capita incomes similar to the PRC.4 In 2014, the PRC\u2019s urbanization rate was 54.8%. \nHowever, when rural migrants in urban areas without urban hukou (household registration) were \ndiscounted, the urbanization rate was only 36.7%.5 The majority of rural migrants\u2014about 236 \nmillion in 2013, predominantly males and single females in their 20s or 30s\u2014reside in urban \nareas  in  the  short  term  (less  than  6  months)  or  long  term  (more  than  6 months)  without \nbecoming  permanent  urban  residents  (with  urban  hukou),  while  leaving  married  women, \nchildren, and the elderly in their home villages. Against this background, the Government of the \nPRC aims to (i) grant urban residencies to about 100 million rural migrants living in urban areas \nwith rural hukou, (ii) rebuild urban villages for another 100 million people, and (iii) develop small \ntowns and cities for 100 million more people in the poor central and western regions during the \nplan period 2016\u20132020.   \n \n3.  The PRC\u2019s economy and administration systems have been marked by a dual structure \nsharply dividing the urban and the rural. The systems of household registration, land ownership, \nlabor protection, social security, and other basic public services, as well as public resource \nallocation, have been based on the urban\u2013rural divide, strictly containing rural\u2013urban migration \nuntil the early 1990s.6 This dual structure has inadvertently created innumerable barriers to \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 November 2016. \n2  ADB. 2016.

Tokyo: \nADBI.  \n ", "2   \nbalanced development of urban and rural areas, resulting in a large per capita income gap \nbetween urban and rural households, and widespread poverty in rural areas.7 In this context, \nrural\u2013urban migration occurred mostly for economic reasons and saw significant growth during \n1990\u20131995. The remittances rural migrants send back home have contributed to raising rural \nhousehold incomes and alleviating poverty. Moreover, rural migrants, largely from the central \nand western regions to the eastern and southern coastal regions where export-processing \nmanufacturing  industries  were  located,  are  said  to  have  supported  strong  economic \ndevelopment  of  the  coastal  regions.8 However,  with  the  economy  undergoing  fundamental \ntransformation and its growth slowing, there have been reverse movements of rural migrants \nfrom urban areas to home villages in part because of a decrease in jobs, low coverage of social \nsecurity, and limited access to basic public services. \n \n4.  Rural migrants without urban hukou in urban areas faced numerous difficulties. They \nwere excluded from high-paying jobs, and were more disadvantaged than local residents with \nurban  hukou  in  obtaining  even  low-paying  jobs.  Their  wages  were  lower  than  those  of \npermanent urban residents in the same jobs. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the \nproportion  in  2011  of  rural  migrants  in  urban  areas  covered  by  old-age  pension  (13.9%), \noccupational  injury  insurance  (23.6%),  health  insurance  (16.7%),  unemployment  insurance \n(8.0%),  and  maternity  insurance  (5.6%)  was  much  lower  than  that  of  permanent  urban \nresidents. Children of rural migrants in urban areas were often admitted to kindergartens and \nschools for higher fees than those for urban resident children. Moreover, rural migrants without \nurban hukou encountered restrictions and were required to provide social security contributions \nor higher down payments when buying houses in urban areas. To address these issues, the \ngovernment introduced, for instance, an urban\u2013rural unified old-age pension system in 2014. \nThe Thirteenth Five-Year Plan further specifies measures to equalize basic public services and \nintegrate rural migrants into urban areas, such as reforming the household registration system \nand implementing the residence permit system with a mechanism to link intergovernmental \nfiscal transfer to the integration process. \n \n5.  However, although rural migrants living in urban areas are encouraged to transfer the \nhousehold registration to their urban residences under the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, many are \nunable and/or unwilling to abandon rural hukou because of their ownership of the land use \nrights in home villages and land-dependent lifestyle. The PRC\u2019s land management system has \nbeen based on a construction-use land quota-rationing system to maintain adequate farmland to \nguarantee national food security. Under this system, rural migrants have to transfer, in principle, \nthe construction-use land quotas equivalent to the residential land in their home villages to \nurban  areas.  Nonetheless,  the  rural  residential  land-use  rights  cannot  be  traded  with  the \nconstruction-use land quotas in urban areas because (i) the rural land-use rights are collectively \nowned by villages, while urban land-use rights are owned by the state; and (ii) there is no \nadequate land valuation system and unified land market between urban and rural areas. Reform \nof  the  household  registration  system  has  further  been  constrained  by  a  lack  of  support \nmechanisms to help rural migrants adapt to different lifestyles in urban areas.    \n \n6.  Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, located in central Yunnan Province, forms part of \nthe PRC\u2019s poverty-stricken western region. It is the home of several ethnic minority groups (the \nlargest is the Yi), which in 2015 accounted for more than 35% of the population. The prefecture \nis mountainous, with only 8.3% of the land area classified as flatland. It is prone to natural \n                                                \n7  In 2014, the per capita income of urban households was 2.75 times higher than that of rural households. \n8  Footnote 4; Y. Zhang. 2016. Urbanization, Inequality, and Poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China. ADBI Working \nPaper Series. No. 584. Tokyo: ADBI.  \n ", "  3 \nhazards such as landslides and floods, which severely hit poor rural areas. The per capita \nincome of rural households in the prefecture was CNY8,327 in 2015, barely one-third of that of \nurban households (CNY26,763), and well below the rural per capita income at the national level \n(CNY11,422). Because of its sociogeographic characteristics and poor transport infrastructure, \nwhich are also common to other poor prefectures in the PRC\u2019s central and western regions, the \nprefecture lags in economic development and industrialization, which negatively affects the \nurbanization rate (40.4% in 2015, lower than Yunnan Province [43.3%] and the PRC [56.1%]). \nEven  labor-intensive,  resource-based  manufacturing  with  low  entry  barriers  remains \nunderdeveloped and has generated little stable employment for rural migrants. The prefecture \nis, therefore, trapped in a vicious circle\u2014low industrialization leads to slow rural\u2013urban migration \nand urbanization and, consequently, slow progress in poverty reduction.  \n \n7.  In  2010,  the  Chuxiong  Prefecture  Government\u2019s  Policy  Research  and  Legislative \nAdvisory  Office  conducted  a  study  to  develop  policy  recommendations  promoting  gradual \nmigration of the rural population to urban areas: first, rural\u2013rural migration from mountainous \nareas  to  semi-mountainous  and  flatland  areas;  second,  rural\u2013urban  migration  without  the \nchange of household registration (long-term rural migrants in urban areas); and third, rural\u2013\nurban migration with the change of household registration (permanent urban residents).9 Some \nof the recommendations were incorporated in the prefecture government plan documents, such \nas  the  Chuxiong  Prefecture  New  Type  Urbanization  Plan,  2014\u20132020,  and  the  Chuxiong \nPrefecture Rural Poverty Reduction Plan, 2011\u20132020.10 The study also had impacts beyond \nChuxiong, providing a reference for other similar prefectures in the central and western regions.  \n \n8.  Since the study, however, policy and economic environments have changed, requiring a \nnew study of rural migrants and returnees. That is, as the government implements structural \nreforms in the context of the slowing economic growth, rural migrants have started to return to \nhome villages. On the other hand, the Government of the PRC has furthered reform of the \nhousehold  registration  system.  Yet  in  implementation,  some  issues,  such  as  the  land \nmanagement system, urban\u2013rural disparities in basic public services, and lack of non-farming \nindustries to provide stable employment opportunities for rural migrants in urban areas, have \nbecome more prominent. Moreover, some progressive municipalities such as Chongqing have \nsuccessfully implemented major reforms of the household registration system, social security \nsystem, and land management system, achieving better integration of rural migrants into urban \nareas,  and  higher  industrialization  and  urbanization.  These  cases  indicate  that  policy  and \ninstitutional  changes  at  local  levels  can  promote  gradual  rural\u2013urban  migration  and  urban \nsettlements development. Such policy and institutional changes, which were examined on an ad \nhoc basis in the previous study, need to be more systematically studied with possibility for \ndissemination at regional and national levels. \n \n9.  The TA supports the government\u2019s efforts to safeguard and improve living standards \nthrough people-centered urbanization. It is directly linked to ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, \n2016\u20132020 for the PRC, which emphasizes inclusive economic growth by reducing poverty and \ninequality.11 The TA will create synergy with the ongoing loan in Chuxiong Prefecture, and \ncomplement other TA projects in the PRC for urban\u2013rural linkages and balanced urban and \n                                                \n9  Policy Research and Legislative Advisory Office of the Chuxiong Prefecture Government. 2010.

THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be the achievement of more people-centered urbanization. The outcome \nwill be the definition of enabling environments for gradual rural\u2013urban migration and urban \nsettlements  development  in  Chuxiong  Prefecture.  By  2019,  the  Chuxiong  Prefecture \ngovernment will have approved recommended policy actions and incorporated them into plan \ndocuments.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will have two outputs: (i) positive and negative factors for gradual rural\u2013urban \nmigration and urban settlements development identified, and (ii) policy recommendations for \nenabling gradual rural\u2013urban migration and urban settlements development proposed.  \n \n12.  Output 1: Positive and negative factors for gradual rural\u2013urban migration and \nurban settlements development identified. The TA will first support desk reviews of legal, \npolicy, institutional, and regulatory frameworks on (i) creating enabling environments for rural \nmigrant integration into urban areas; (ii) agro- and non-farming industries and enterprises, labor \nmarket, taxes, research and development, human resource development, and others; (iii) urban \nand rural land management at local and central levels; and (iv) employment, labor protection \nand activation, and social security at local and central levels. It will then support the design and \nconduct of a survey, focus group discussions, and interviews with rural migrants and returnees, \nincluding those who have settled in small towns and engaged in agro- or non-farming industries. \nAdditionally, the TA will conduct key informant interviews at the national, provincial, and local \nlevels to investigate the degree to which laws, policies, and regulations have been implemented, \nand obstacles encountered by rural migrants, governments, and others inside and outside \nChuxiong Prefecture. The TA will also identify good practice cases and prepare at least three \ncase studies in each of the following areas: (i) the development of agro- and non-farming \nindustries and small towns based on non-farming industries to ensure stable employment for \nrural migrants, (ii) the land valuation system and unified land market between urban and rural \nareas, and (iii) the reform of the household registration system and the urban\u2013rural equalization \nof basic public services by establishing a unified labor market and social security systems and \nsustainable financing mechanisms.  \n \n13.  Output 2: Policy recommendations for enabling gradual rural\u2013urban migration and \nurban settlements development proposed. The TA will support the preparation of policy \nrecommendations to enable gradual rural\u2013urban migration and urban settlements development \nin Chuxiong Prefecture based on output 1. At least three seminars on policy recommendations \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2014.

These recommendations will be elaborated in three policy \nnotes to be presented and discussed at the TA final workshop organized with participants from \nthe Government of the PRC. International study visits to countries, which are advanced in small-\ntown development based on non-farming industries and in urban\u2013rural equalization of basic \npublic services, will also be organized. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, administrative support, \nlogistics, local transportation, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The  Chuxiong  Prefecture  Bureau  of  Finance  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  will \noversee  the  coordination  of  bureaus  and  institutions  involved  in  the  development  and \nimplementation  of  policy  actions  to  promote  rural\u2013urban  migration  and  urban  settlements \ndevelopment. The implementing agency will be the Chuxiong Prefecture government\u2019s Policy \nResearch  and  Legislative  Advisory  Office,  which  will  assume  overall  responsibility  for  TA \nactivities in coordination with the bureaus and institutions involved. The TA will establish a \nproject  steering  committee  to  provide  overall  implementation  guidance  and  support.  The \ncommittee will be chaired by the director of the Chuxiong Prefecture Bureau of Finance and \ncomprise representatives from the Chuxiong Prefecture Bureaus of Land Resources, Housing \nand Urban\u2013Rural Construction, Resettlement and Development, Human Resources and Social \nSecurity, Ethnic Minority, and Education, as well as the Poverty Alleviation Office, Statistics \nOffice, and the Policy Research and Legislative Advisory Office. \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented from 15 December 2016 to 31 December 2018. Proceeds of \nthe TA will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time).  Equipment  procurement  will  be  done  following  ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). Purchased equipment will be \nturned over to the executing agency upon completion of the TA activities. \n \n17.  A consulting firm will be engaged to provide 22.5 person-months of consulting inputs \n(international, 4.5 person-months; national, 18.0 person-months), using the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 and the simplified technical proposal. \nAll consultants will be engaged following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \nThe TA will use lump-sum payments and an output-based contract. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Creating Enabling Environments for \nGradual  Rural\u2013Urban  Migration  and  Urban  Settlements  Development  in  Chuxiong  Yi \nAutonomous Prefecture, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nMore people-centered urbanization achieved (Thirteenth Five-Year Plan)a  \n \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nEnabling  a.
