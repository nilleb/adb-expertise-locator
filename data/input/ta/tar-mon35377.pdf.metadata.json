INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Assistance to the road sector to redress regional imbalances by improving access and \nregional  economic  integration  is  one  of  the  two  main  recommendations  of  the  poverty \npartnership agreement review incorporated in Country Strategy and Program Update (2002-\n2004)  for  Mongolia  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank (ADB). Therefore, the Government of \nMongolia requested that a project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for preparing the Third \nRoads Development Project1 (the project) to be included in the 2002 TA program and 2004 \nlending program.  \n \n2.  The Fact-Finding Mission visited Mongolia from 13 to 24 May 2002 to survey the project \narea and discuss the objectives, scope, and cost of the TA. This report is based on the findings \nof the Mission, the discussions held with officials of the Ministry of Finance and Economy, \nMinistry of Infrastructure (MOI), Ministry of Nature and Environment, Department of Roads \n(DOR), Traffic Police Department, Household Livelihood Support Program Office, and State \nCustoms  Administration,  and  the  subsequent  memorandum  of  understanding  between  the \nGovernment and the Mission. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Successive post-soviet governments have introduced free-market policies, initiatives to \npromote domestic and international trade, and financial and energy sector reforms. Mongolia \njoined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1997, but recent growth rates have fallen below \nthe estimated average of 3.5%.  However, privatization of the Trade and Development Bank, \nand policies aimed at encouraging continued development of a democratic, market-oriented \nsociety are likely to enable the economy to expand at 3% in 2002 and 4.9% in 2003.2 The \noverall demand for transportation between 1995 and 2000 grew substantially, as evidenced by \nthe doubling of rail freight volume and vehicular traffic on the Ulaan Baatar to Altanbulag road \n(see Map). \n \n4.  Existing  transportation  infrastructure  is  skeletal  and  services  are  infrequent, \ninaccessible, and/or unreliable.  Although connected to the Russian and PRC networks, the \nnational railway network consists of only  1,815 kilometers (km) of broad (1.524-meter) gauge \nrailway, including the 1,100-km Trans-Mongolian railway from Altanbulag near the Russian \nborder to Zamyn Uud near the PRC border.  Today, it is the only continuous transportation \nfacility linking the north and the south of the country. The state manages about 11,000 km of \nroads, of which only about 1,500 km are paved.3  The road network also includes approximately \n39,000 km of local roads that are managed by the aimags (provinces) and are rough cross-\ncountry dirt tracks. The domestic air transport system has 34 airports, only three of which \n(including the international airport in Ulaan Baatar) have paved runways of more than 3,000 \nmeters.  Moreover,  modal  integration  is  insufficient  and  international  customs  facilities  and \nprocedures are too inflexible to permit easy movement of goods and people within Mongolia and \nacross international boundaries. \n \n5.  Initial planning of the road sector was carried out under ADB-funded TA 1820-MON: \nRoad  Master  Plan  and  Feasibility  Study.4  Subsequently,  TA  2380-MON:  Institutional \n                                                 \n1  The Project first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities  (Internet edition) on 16 April 2002. \n2  ADB. 2002. Asian Development Outlook 2002 Update. Manila \n3  Source: DOR. \n4  ADB. 1992. TA to Mongolia for Road Master Plan and Feasibility Study. Manila. ", "2  \nStrengthening of the Road Sector5 assisted the Government to develop a system of cost-\nrecovery from road users, and road safety guidelines aimed at helping implement road safety \nimprovement  strategies  were  prepared  under  TA  5620-REG:  Regional  Initiatives  in  Road \nSafety.6 Although the recommendations of TA 2380-MON and TA 5620-REG have not been \nfully implemented, based on the recommendations of TA 1820-MON, development of the \nprincipal north-south state road that extends from Altanbulag through Ulaan Baatar to Zamyn \nUud (Map) has been awarded high priority by the Government. The road forms part of the \ncorridor designated as Asian Highway Route A-3 by the United Nations Economic and Social \nCommission for Asia and Pacific (UNESCAP). The northern portion of this corridor, a 312 km \nsection from Ulaan Baatar to Altanbulag, was improved under ADB Loan 1364-MON [SF]: \nRoads Development Project.7 It is now a two-lane, asphalt concrete road with a 6-meter wide \npavement, 2-meter wide gravel shoulders, and a design speed of 80 kilometers per hour. The \nfirst part of the southern portion from Ulaan Baatar to Zamyn Uud, which lies between Nalaih \n(the southern outskirts of Ulaan Baatar) and Choir, is currently being upgraded to a two-lane \npaved road under ADB Loan 1700-MON: Second Roads Development Project.8 It is expected to \nbe completed by July 2004.  \n \n6.  Aside  from  ADB  assistance,  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Transport  Development  Project \n(approximately  a  $50  million  loan)  and  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency\u2019s  Railway \nFacility  Rehabilitation  Project  (Y530  million  grant)  have  facilitated  the  development  of  the \ntransport sector. In March 2001, the World Bank approved an investment credit of $34 million to \nupgrade  and  reconstruct  roads,  but  in  central  and  western  Mongolia.  In  June  2002,  the \nGovernment launched a $4.5 million bond issue to finance the \u201cMillenium Road\u201d project, which \ncomprises both east-west and north-south roads.  However, despite the expressions of interest \nby Russian companies in this project and the Government\u2019s request for external assistance, the \nChairman of the National Committee for Millenium Project has indicated that financing for road \nbuilding is still lacking.9 Therefore, even after completion of ADB\u2019s Second Roads Development \nProject, the southern portion of the north-south corridor will remain a partial bottleneck to \ndomestic and international traffic due to the lack of a conventional paved road from Choir to \nZamyn Uud.   \n  \n7.  The alignment most widely used by vehicles currently travelling between Choir and \nZamyn Uud passes through two aimags. Approximately 5% of the alignment is in Gobi Sumber \naimag; the rest is in Dornogobi and passes through six townships and the capital, Sainshand.  \nThe total population of the two aimags is approximately 63,000, and both have vast mineral \nresources and almost 1.5 million livestock. A significant portion of the population and economic \nactivity is concentrated within the north-south transportation corridor.  However, residents and \naimag  administrators  believe  that  the  lack  of  transport  infrastructure  and  services  in  the \nsouthern portion of the corridor is stifling regional development, employment creation, and \npoverty alleviation.10  \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1995.

According to a World Bank study,11 the proposed project is likely to have the greatest \npotential traffic and stimulate economic development in southern Gobi.  It will provide all-\nweather access from the potential mineral and oil producing areas of southern Mongolia to the \nPRC, and help create a continuous thoroughfare for international passenger and freight traffic \nbetween the PRC and South East Asia, and Russia and Europe. After improvements to border \nfacilities and procedures are fully implemented and Asian Highway Route A-3 is completed, \ntravel times, for example between certain major production and attraction centers in the PRC \nand Russia, will be drastically reduced. Moreover, the irreversible damage being caused to the \nfragile  ecosystem  of  the  Gobi  desert  will  be  largely  arrested  when  the  vehicles  currently \ncrossing a corridor spanning about 200 km between Choir and Zamyn Uud are channeled on to \nthe Project road. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The main purpose of the TA is to conduct a comprehensive study of the feasibility of \nconstructing a paved road of about 430 km from Choir to the PRC border with financing from \nADB.  The study will (i) establish the optimum alignment and technical standards for the road; \n(ii) determine the feasibility of the project, and prepare preliminary design and cost estimates; \n(iii) identify procedures and facilities needed to expedite the flow of people and goods across \nthe international border with the PRC; (iv) develop a framework for institutional and policy \nreform aimed at enhancing efficiency  of road transport and logistical services; (v) assess \nopportunities for modal integration to support seamless freight and passenger transport; and (vi) \nevaluate overall social impact of road investment, particularly on poverty and traffic safety.  The \nTA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  A team of international consultants supported by domestic consultants will be chosen to \nundertake the study. The consultants will use a series of physical field surveys, literature \nreviews, and interviews to collect the necessary data and analyze it. Key activities under the TA \nwill  include,  but  will  not  be  limited  to  (i)  performance  of  geotechnical,  hydrological,  and \nalignment surveys, and evaluation of road infrastructure improvement options; (ii) identification \nof the preferred option and preparation of a preliminary design; (iii) preparation of the scope of \ncivil  works  to  be  financed;  (iv)  assessment  of  national  and  regional  economic  and  trade \ndevelopment  with  and  without  the  project;  (v)  conduct  of  poverty  and  social  analysis  in \naccordance with the ADB Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis; (vi) conduct of an initial \nenvironmental  examination,  and  if  necessary,  an  environmental  impact  assessment,  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s  Environmental Assessment Requirement and Environmental Review \nProcedures and Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects; (vi) preparation \nof an outline of policy reforms related to road transport and logistics services; (vii) preparation of \nan intermodal transportation plan while taking into account trade and social development needs \nof the project area and Mongolia as a whole; (viii) review and recommendation of procedures \nand regulations for expediting passenger and freight transportation across international borders \nof Mongolia; and (iv) development of a system for monitoring impacts of the project on poverty.  \nAn outline of the terms of reference (TOR) for the consultants is given in Appendix 2, and the \nsummary initial poverty and social assessment conducted by the Mission is given in Appendix 3. \n                                                 \n11 The World Bank. 1999.

Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at about $706,000 including a foreign exchange \ncomponent of about $410,000 and a local cost component of about $296,000 equivalent. The \nGovernment has requested ADB funds to cover the entire foreign exchange cost of $410,000 \nand a portion of the local currency cost ($190,000).  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide the \nremaining local cost of $106,000 equivalent in-kind.  A detailed cost estimate is given in \nAppendix 4.  The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto financing any ensuing project. The ensuing project, if deemed feasible, is likely to cost \napproximately $40 million. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  DOR will be the Executing Agency for the TA.  A full-time project manager and a team of \ngovernment officers appointed by DOR will serve as counterparts to the consultants. The MOI \nwill form a project steering committee comprising the deputy director general of DOR as \nchairperson,  project  manager,  and  a  representative  of  MOI  to  supervise  and  monitor  the \ntechnical outputs of the work. To facilitate technology and knowledge transfer, the Government \nwill assign to the TA suitably qualified counterpart staff. The staff will have had formal education \nand  training  in  transportation  engineering,  economics,  social  science,  and  business \nadministration. They  will be sourced primarily from DOR and relevant government agencies, \nand will work alongside the international consultants.  Additionally, staff will be made available \nto assist with survey and fieldwork, when necessary.  \n \n13.  The TA, tentatively scheduled to commence in December 2002, will require 48 person-\nmonths of consulting services (14 person-months of international and 34 person-months of \ndomestic  consultant  services).  The  TA  will  be  completed  within  8  months  of  the  date  of \ncommencement.    The  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  collectively  have  broad \nexpertise in (i) road design and construction, including environmental planning; (ii) materials and \ngeotechnical engineering; (iii) transport economics and transport systems planning; (iv) social \nand poverty analysis; (v) bridge and hydraulic engineering; and (vi) international trade and \ncustoms procedures.  Consulting firms will be required to submit full technical proposals, which \nwill be evaluated according to ADB\u2019s quality-and-cost-based selection method. The consultants \nwill be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants.  Equipment will \nbe purchased in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n14.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a National Priority in    Sector identified as a National Priority in   \nCountry Poverty Analysis?    Yes  Country Poverty Partnership Agreement?    Yes \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Mongolia: - The road development program will \nimprove the economic development of the country and will promote increased trade with Russia and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. This will increase income and unemployment opportunities, which will reduce \npoverty. The road will also have localized benefits for 50,000 people near the road alignment, of which nearly \n30% are currently unemployed. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Proposed Poverty Classification: Other \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  Poverty analysis will be carried out to assess the poverty situation in \nthe project area and investigate how the Project can help reduce poverty by incorporating specific measures \nunder the project scope. The incidence of poverty is expected to be more than 50%, based on high level of \nunemployment. The analysis will be carried out following the guidelines in Handbook on Poverty and Social \nAnalysis and Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact on Economic Analysis of Projects. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder Analysis \u2013 Stakeholders will be identified during the project preparatory technical assistance (TA) \nand consultation, particularly with local government and project beneficiaries will be carried out during \npreparation of the feasibility study. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) will include survey of people\u2019s \nperceptions and opinions on the project.  \nParticipation strategy required:  A plan for participation during implementation will be prepared. There is a \npotential role for nongovernment agencies, which will be formulated under the TA. \n \nD.  Potential Issues \n   Significant/     \nNot    Plan Required \nSignificant/  Strategy to Address Issues \nUncertain/   \nNone \nResettlement   None  The project is classified as Category C.  None \nGender   Uncertain  Gender issues will be identified and addressed as part of  None \n    the poverty and social analysis. The Asian Development \n  Bank Policy on Gender and Development will be followed \nby the executing agency during project preparation and \nimplementation.   \nAffordability   None  The Project will not have user charges. People currently  None \nuse the railway or vehicles that use dirt tracks. The new \nroad will reduce travel time and vehicle operating costs. \nLabor  Not  Road construction will generate employment, particularly  None \n  Significant  for the poor. Given the high level of underemployment, \n  this will be very positive and will not cause competition for \nlabor that might otherwise affect local business. \nIndigenous  Not  Most project beneficiaries are Mongols while minorities  None \nPeople  Significant  include Russians and Chinese. These minorities are not \n  considered to be vulnerable groups and they will be \n  beneficiaries under the project. \nOther Risks/  Uncertain  In the project area, many people have a nomadic lifestyle.  To be \nVulnerabilities  Since the road would run parallel to an existing railway, no  addressed in the \n  incremental adverse impacts are anticipated.
