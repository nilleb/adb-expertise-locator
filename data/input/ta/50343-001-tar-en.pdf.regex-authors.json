Analysis on Key Issues  \n1.  Background. The Yangtze River is the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s (PRC's) longest \nriver.  The  region  covers  more  than  2  million  square  kilometers,  one-fifth  of  the  country \ngeographically, and accounts for over 40% of PRC's total population and about 45% of the \ngross domestic product. The Yangtze River, one of the busiest inland rivers for freight traffic \nworldwide, is home to the largest hydropower plant in the world and is the source of water for \nthe South\u2013North water transfer project. Nine provinces and two specially-administered cities \nmake up the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) subregion, which includes three major urban \nagglomeration  areas:  (i)  the  Yangtze  River  Delta  Global  Mega  Agglomeration  focused  on \nShanghai, (ii) the Middle Yangtze City cluster focused on Wuhan, and (iii) the Yangtze Upper \nReaches focused on Chongqing.  Due to its geographical and demographical advantages, the \nPRC Government has identified the YREB as one of the three key \u2018growth engines\u2019 to ensure \nPRC\u2019s future economic development.  \n \n2.  However, environmental concerns are increasing. Pollution of the Yangtze River has \nreached its highest levels which has severely reduced drinking water quality, posed health risks, \ncaused loss of biodiversity, hazardous chemical accumulation in organisms in the food chain, \nand increased eutrophication. Pollutants range from suspended substances, oxidizing organic \nand inorganic compounds, and ammonia nitrogen which result from discharge from industrial \nsolid  and  chemical  waste,  domestic  solid  waste  and  sewage,  shipping  discharges,  and \nagricultural runoff.  The impact of this pollution is exacerbated in smaller lakes and tributaries off \nthe  main  Yangtze  River  stem  where  shallow  and  slower  flowing  water  leads  to  worse \neutrophication  and  high  concentrations  of  the  pollutants.  In  addition,  possible  riverbank \ncollapses  and  landslides  as  a  result  of  damming,  flooding,  changes  in  land  use,  and \ndeforestation add even more stress to the water quality of the Yangtze River.1 \n \n3.  Climate projections show an increase in flooding hazards in most humid-affected Asian \nmonsoon  regions,  including  the  Yangtze  River  Basin  due  to  increase  in  high  intensity \nprecipitation.2 Asian Development Bank (ADB) identified the upper region of the Yangtze River \nas one of three PRC regions particularly prone to climate-induced migration, due to loss of \nlivelihoods and livelihood opportunities caused by a loss of and degraded natural resources.3  \n \n4.  Development constraints. Economic development in the YREB is considered below its \npotential capacity. This is due to (i) limited overall institutional coordination for strategic planning \nfor  the  YREB;  (ii)  significant  regional  disparity  between  the  highly-developed  global \nagglomeration region of the Yangtze River Delta and the subregions of the middle and upper \nreaches of the YREB with the latter two lagging behind in economic diversification and industrial \nmodernization; (iii) limited integration of waterways, ports, and intermodal logistics; and (iv) \nincreasing environmental pollution and pressure on natural resources.  \n \n                                                \n1  ADB.  2016.

In line with the circular economy approach to reduce resource \ninputs, waste outputs, and pollution control, in April 2014, the State Council issued guidelines to \nstimulate economic development of the Yangtze River Basin, while at the same time promote \nsustainable natural resource use and protection and apply stricter control over pollution along \nthe river. Key features of the guidelines included the enhancement of the services industry, \ngreen energy, and modern agriculture, with coordinated urbanization within the region, including \nin the Yangtze middle-reach city cluster, Chengdu-Chongqing city cluster and in Guizhou and \nYunnan  provinces.  In  addition,  the  government  also  noted  the  need  to  better  coordinate, \nintegrate, and implement development approaches among the provinces, including a need for \nimproved coordination, cooperation, and connectivity from the upper to lower reaches.4  \n \n6.  The National Development and Reform Commission subsequently prepared the YREB \nDevelopment Plan 2016\u20132030, which focuses on green development to transform economic \nactivities involving the Yangtze River subregion to protect and rehabilitate the environment.5 The \nYREB Development Plan aims to strengthen access to regions along the upper and middle \nreaches of the Yangtze to boost growth by promoting green development in inland regions to \nreduce  the  regional  development  gap  between  the  eastern,  central,  and  western  YREB \nsubregion. The plan sets an ambitious target that the country will significantly improve the \nenvironmental quality of Yangtze River by 2020, with over 75% of the region's water meeting \nGrade III standard or above and forest coverage to reach 43%.6 The plan has three key \ninitiatives:  (i)  promote  environmental  protection,  rehabilitation,  and  management  of  water \nresources;  (ii)  strengthen  green  and  inclusive  industrial  transformation;  and  (iii)  improve \nmultimodal transport corridor and logistics.  \n \n7.  Lessons learned. ADB\u2019s past assistance to the YREB has been multisectoral investing \nover $10 billion from 2000 to 2015. In addition to lending support, ADB has been supporting \nhigh-level forums and policy dialogues to support watershed management, poverty alleviation, \nand  ecological  and  environmental  protection  of  the  Yangtze  River,  to  help  guide  potential \ninvestment in green development and environmental protection for the YREB. Lessons learned \nfrom previous support in the YREB indicate that many projects are still seen as stand-alone \ninterventions, with still limited linkages to other similar interventions. Also, the PRC country \nassistance program evaluation for 2006\u20132013 stated that the lack of continuity made it difficult \nfor loan project clients to internalize good international practices.7 It recommended that, in \nconsultation with the government, ADB could identify certain well-defined areas where it can \nmake visible contributions to the government\u2019s programs. Moreover, it suggested to vastly \nincrease support for addressing climate change and protection of the environment.  \n \nB.     Program of Ensuing Projects \n8.  Programmatic  approach  to  green  development.  In  line  with  these  lessons,  the \ngovernment emphasized the need for ADB support through a strategic framework approach that \nwould coordinate and create synergy between investment projects and technical assistance (TA) \nto strengthen the impact of proposed assistance. ADB\u2019s scope of support to the strategic \n                                                \n4  Aspects that require needed coordination include urban and social development, human resource capacity and \nworkforce development, economic and industrial development, multi-tier and multimodal transport infrastructure \ndevelopment, environmental protection and water resources management, reduced nonpoint source pollution from \nagriculture, energy supply and management including renewable and low-carbon initiatives, and private sector \nengagement. \n5  PRC Government. 2016.

This approach will ensure \nADB\u2019s investment will play a catalytic role in the broader program of the YREB. \n \n9.   Ensuing Projects. The Government of PRC requested ADB to support and strengthen \nefforts  in  the  environmental  protection  and  rehabilitation  of  the  YREB. During  the  country \nprogramming  mission  in  2016,  ADB  and  the  Government  of  PRC  agreed  to  a  strategic \nframework approach with a lending support of $1.8 billion to YREB for a period of over four \nyears (2017\u20132020). The support is broadly based, including project loans and TA (Table 1) to \npromote  ecosystem  conservation  and  green  development  through  integrated  river  basin \necosystem management to reduce pollution and degradation of natural resources, promote \nenvironmental protection and rehabilitation, stimulate sustainable economic growth, and apply \nintegrated water resource management (Appendix 2).8  \n \nTable 1: Program of Ensuing Projects \nEnsuing project titles  Descriptions \nYangtze River Green Ecological  The project will support farmers in 6 provinces within the Yangtze River basin \nCorridor Comprehensive  (Yunnan, Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Hunan, and Hubei) to modernize their \nAgriculture Development Project  agriculture production systems. These systems will be more productive, increase \nfarmer incomes, and be environmentally-sustainable with efficient water and soil \nresource use and protection, reduce agriculture nonpoint source pollution and \npromote ecosystem rehabilitation.  The project is estimated to cost $451 million \nof which $300 million will be financed by ADB.
