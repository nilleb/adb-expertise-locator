INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Programming  Mission  in  2002,  the \nGovernment of Uzbekistan requested advisory technical assistance (TA) to improve its cadastre \nand real property registration system. The Government considers that a unified state cadastre \nsystem would lead to more efficient use of land resources and real property, and ease the \ntransition to a market economy. A concept note to this effect was submitted to ADB by the State \nCommittee for Land Resources in September 2002 and the TA1 was later included in the 2003 \nProgram in ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update (2003\u20132005). A Fact-Finding Mission \nfielded by ADB in May 2003 held discussions based on the concept note with staffs of central and \nlocal government agencies and international agencies concerned, and reached an understanding \nwith  the  Government  on  the  objectives,  scope,  cost  estimates,  terms  of  reference,  and \nimplementation arrangements for the TA. The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Agriculture is the foundation of the Uzbek economy. It accounts for about 28% of the \ngross domestic product (GDP) and employs about 44% of the labor force. Cotton exports alone \nbring in almost 50% of foreign exchange earnings. However, serious environmental problems \nfollowing decades of rigid state control over agricultural activities have led to a decline in cotton \nand wheat production and substantial financial losses for state-controlled cooperative farms. \nMandatory production targets severely restrict crop rotation and push farmers to overuse water, \nfertilizers, and chemicals. Thus, water resources are depleted and soil quality impaired. The \nincentive to improve agricultural productivity remains an issue as the entire production is sold to \nthe State at a regulated price.   \n \n3.  To improve productivity, the Government has made it a policy to restructure state farms \ngradually  as  part  of  the  transition  toward  a  market  economy.  Restructuring  involves  (i) \nreorganizing cooperative farms and distributing the lands to individual farmers; (ii) adopting more \nflexible cropping patterns and significantly lower procurement quotas for cotton and wheat; and \n(iii) giving farmers the freedom to sell yields produced above the quota. Changes in agricultural \npolicy2 and land tenure have allowed private farmers to hold private use rights and to decide on \ntheir own what to grow and what to sell in the market above certain reduced quotas for cotton and \nwheat to be sold at fixed prices to the government. In the last 2 years, more than 300 cooperative \nfarms (about 15% of the national total) were reorganized, and more than 1.66 million hectares of \nland was distributed to more than 80,000 individual farmers. The increasing productivity of these \nfarms has encouraged the Government to continue the restructuring (Presidential Decree on 24 \nMarch 2003). \n \n4.  As the Government is committed to privatize more farmland, individual land parcels must \nbe marked out, registered, and accurately graded. There is, thus, an urgent need to strengthen \nthe cadastre system so as to (i) accurately assess and collect the land tax, (ii) privatize farms on \nthe basis of sound technical principles, (iii) ensure sustainable management of land resources, \nand  (iv)  facilitate  the  eventual  adoption  of  private  property  rights  and  secure  land  tenure.3 \n                                                 \n1\n The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 21 April 2003. \n2\n ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project. Manila. \n3\n The legal status of asset ownership  and responsibilities for maintenance  are  unclear, causing  confusion  on \nindividualized farming operation. According to the 1998 Land Code of Uzbekistan, land leased for possession or use \ncan only be transferred through inheritance up to the expiration of the term established in the original lease contract. \nThe code does not address the issue of private land ownership and assumes that all land will remain State-owned for \nthe foreseeable future. ", "2 \nAlthough the cadastre system now covers the quality of soil and availability of water and mineral \ncontent, it is far from adequate to meet these expectations, as real property registration remains \nincomplete. The state land cadastre system requires systematic and comprehensive updating to \ncover buildings and property use rights for privatized land. The implications of granting limited \nland use rights for the productivity of privatized farms must be assessed as well. \n \n5.  At the moment, the state land cadastre system is managed and updated by many different \nagencies and therefore lacks consistency in data format and integrity. There is no systematic \nprocedure  for  registering  privately  used  farmlands  in  a  unified  cadastre  system,  and  no \nmechanism for efficient land administration and information sharing between the central and local \ngovernments. The Government recognizes that a rationalized and unified state cadastre system \nis a priority condition for efficient land management and a successful transition toward a market \neconomy4 (Cabinet Resolution No. 255, 17 July 1996). It has therefore sought ADB\u2019s assistance \nin developing a methodology for a computerized and integrated land information, property right \nregistration, and cadastre system, which can be expanded nationwide. \n \n6.  The Government has received assistance in this regard from international agencies. Staff \nmembers of the relevant government offices have been trained overseas (under the auspices of \nthe Swedish International Development Agency [Sida]). A draft legal framework for a unified \ncadastre system has been developed (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit \n[GTZ]). A feasibility study of a state investment program for establishing a national real property \nrights  registration  system  has  been  carried  out  (European  Union-Technical  Assistance  to \nCommonwealth Independent States [EU-TACIS] Phases I and II, 1996\u20132002). The proposed TA \nwill complement the efforts of these other contributors5 by building on the existing system and \nintegrating the necessary elements step by step. \n \n7.  The TA is in line with ADB\u2019s Country Operational Strategy for Uzbekistan and the Country \nStrategy  and  Program  Update.  Both  documents  emphasize  the  importance  of  policy  and \ninvestment interventions in improving land and water resources management and supporting \ngradual reform in the agriculture sector to increase economic efficiency. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n8.  The long-term sector goal of the TA is to sustain growth in the agriculture sector through \nfarm privatization and environmental management. The immediate objective is to assist the \nGovernment in improving its cadastre system and establishing an integrated mechanism for \nmonitoring land use and productivity and for registering property use rights. The computerized \nsystem will be tested in a designated district in Syrdarya Province where a cooperative farm is \nbeing reorganized for individual distribution. The system will include all types of information on \n                                                 \n4\n  The Government has taken several steps to improve the state cadastre system. It issued Resolution No. 255 (17 July \n1996) reorganizing the UzGeodesCadastre, the geodetic mapping office, under the Cabinet of Ministers, followed by \nthe Law on Uniform State Cadastre (December 2000) and Resolution No. 44 (1 February 2000) establishing a \ncoordination council to undertake the Unified System of State Cadastre. State land cadastres are regulated by the \nLaw on State Land Cadastre (1998) and Cabinet Resolution No. 543  (1998) on the management of state land \ncadastres. \n5\n  Assistance by (i) Sida: Masters of Science in Land Management, since 1998 on a continuing basis for training high-\nqualified specialists in the field of land and property management, through master\u2019s degree program in Sweden; (ii) \nEU-TACIS: Land Registration in Uzbekistan, from 2000 to 2002, for $2 million, for establishing an urban property \nregistration system in Samarkand-Karlstad Twin City; and (iii) GTZ: Development of Cadastral System in Uzbekistan, \nfrom 1997 to 1999, for drafting the Law on State Cadastres (adopted in 2000). ", "3 \nproperty, including land use rights and rural and urban building structures, while establishing \nefficient  intergovernmental  coordination.  The  TA  will  have  the  following  outputs:  (i)  a  cost-\neffective and transparent methodology for cadastral surveys of agricultural land; (ii) a system of \nland  registration,  including  the  registration  of  buildings,  structures,  and  rural  land;  (iii)  a \nmechanism  for  land  use  and  environment  monitoring;  and  (iv) recommended  legislative \namendments  to  make  the  cadastral  and  land  registration  procedures  more  transparent  and \nefficient, and to improve security of land tenure for individual farmers. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA has four major components:  \n \n(i)  Component  1:  Developing  a  cost-effective  and  transparent  methodology  for \ncadastral surveys of rural land. Cadastral surveys of agricultural land are now based on \nisolated surveys of individual farms without geodetic controls, making it impossible to \nintegrate the geographic information into one land information system. Modern technology \nfor cadastral surveying would speed up such work and improve its quality by minimizing \nmanual errors. The needed information could be compiled from relevant agencies and \ncombined into one digital cadastral base map for the area, for various types of analysis \nand applications. Standards and regulations for digital cadastral surveys and mapping will \nbe reviewed, and necessary revisions will be suggested, discussed, and adopted. A \nmodern \u201ctotal station\u201d with a data log will be installed at a provincial office, together with \nmapmaking software. Staff will be trained in the methodology, which will be tested in an \nongoing land redistribution project in the area. The pilot test will be evaluated and a final \nproposal for nationwide implementation will be prepared. \n \n(ii)  Component 2: Developing a complementary registration system for both land and \nbuilding  structures.  The  existing  cadastre  system  should  be  developed  further  to \naccommodate the registration of all land and buildings in one integrated system, while \nkeeping the present organizational arrangements for registration. Since this integrated \nsystem should also be able to handle environmental monitoring, an object-based system \nthat can incorporate different work flows will be developed. The graphical and textual \ndatabases will be integrated. The system design activity should start with assessing (a) \nexisting  standards;  (b)  information  and  database  models;  (c)  procedures  of  involved \nagencies; and (d) work flows between the central, provincial, and local governments. At \nleast three workstations and additional software need to be installed in one provincial \noffice. The system will be developed, tested, and evaluated, and staff will be trained to \nuse it. The output will be a proposal for its nationwide application. \n \n(iii)  Component 3: Developing a multipurpose land information system for land use and \nenvironmental  monitoring.  The  land  registration  system  will  be  developed  into  a \nmultipurpose land information system, to improve land management activities in general, \nincluding cooperative farm restructuring, land use planning, environmental monitoring, \nland valuation, and taxation. This component will focus on the functions of the State \nCommittee of Land Resources at the central, provincial, and local levels, and will assess \nthe information needed to monitor land use and the environment in relation to private \nfarms.  The  required  information  will  be  included  in  the  system  to  be  developed  in \ncomponent 2. Component 3 will pilot-test the system to show how it can be used to \nestimate fairer and more reasonable cotton production quotas and land tax for different \nprivate  farms.  An  additional  workstation  with  geographic  information  system  (GIS) ", "4 \nsoftware will be installed for this purpose and relevant staff will be trained in data entry \nand the use of environmental information for the pilot project. \n \n(iv)  Component 4: Recommending legislative amendments to make the cadastral and \nland registration procedures more transparent and to strengthen security of tenure. \nThe land use rights granted to private farmers still do not include transfer and collateral \nrights.  The  possibility  of  expanding  land  use  rights  and  the  implications  of  such  an \nexpansion for agricultural productivity must be further assessed. The cadastral survey \nmethodology and integrated land registration system to be developed will eventually also \nstreamline land distribution procedures nationwide. Component 4 will therefore focus on \nrecommended changes in legislation to this end, based on experiences gained from the \npilot project and other privatization projects. The draft recommendations will be discussed \nat  a  regional  seminar,  and  the  final  recommendations  will  be  submitted  to  higher \nauthorities for consideration.  \n \n10.  This TA assumes that development toward a market economy, including the privatization \nof  agricultural  land,  will  continue.  While  its  success  will  be  measured  by  the  nationwide \napplication of the integrated land information system, project implementation will depend to a \nlarge  extent  on  the  commitment  of  the  involved  agencies  to  cooperate  in  developing  and \nimplementing the system. The Law on State Cadastres (2000) and the Law on State Land \nCadastre (1998) have set the preconditions for this cooperation and the TA is well in line with \nthese regulations. The involved agencies have committed themselves to cooperating and taking \nownership  of  the  methodology  to  be  developed  with  the  support  of  the  TA.  Should  the \nGovernment  decide  on  more  far-reaching  organizational  reforms,  the  integrated  information \nsystem developed under this TA will be even easier to implement.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $720,000 equivalent, comprising about $417,000 \nin foreign exchange and $303,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will provide $500,000 \nequivalent  to  finance  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $83,000  equivalent  of  the  local \ncurrency cost on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. \nThe Government will fund the remaining $220,000 equivalent for office accommodation, utilities, \nlocal  communications,  administrative  support,  and  counterpart  staff.  A  schedule  of  the  cost \nestimates and the financing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The  Executing  Agency  (EA)  will  be  the  State  Committee  for  Land  Resources \n(GosKomZem). The EA will form a TA management unit (TAMU), which will include a central task \nforce to be responsible for system development work and TA implementation. The TAMU will be \nheaded by a qualified full-time project manager and will have secretarial and administrative \nsupport. The task force will have at least two suitable full-time experts in cadastral surveying, land \nregistration, land information systems, and land use and environmental monitoring from both \nGosKomZem  and  the  Main  Administration  of  Geodesy,  Cartography,  and  State  Cadastre \n(UzGeodesCadastre). This task force will be responsible for components 1\u20134, with support from \nthe international technical advisers. The TAMU and task force members should have relevant \nexperience and adequate language skills. The province and district selected for the pilot test will \nprovide office space and staff for the pilot test\u2014at least four staff members from the province and \ntwo from the district. The provincial and district staff will be trained in the systems and will \nundertake a cadastral survey and land registration in the pilot test.  ", "5 \n13.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  through  close  collaboration  between  the  organizations \nresponsible for the state land cadastre system (GosKomZem and UzGeodesCadastre) and for \nbuilding registration (among them, the Bureau of Technical Inventory under UzGeodesCadastre). \nA Steering Committee, with representatives from GosKomZem, UzGeodesCadastre at the central \nlevel, the provincial government, and the Bureau of Technical Inventory at the provincial level, \nand the local government in the pilot project district, will be formed. It will be chaired by an \nauthorized representative from the Cabinet of Ministers, nominated by the Deputy Prime Minister. \nThe proposed pilot test area is Syrdarja Province, where cotton and wheat collectives are being \nprivatized, and where issues regarding the economic conditions for production, rehabilitation and \nmaintenance  of  the  irrigation  system,  land  use,  and  environmental  monitoring  to  reduce \ndeteriorating soil quality can be considered during TA implementation. The pilot district, to be \nselected during the inception phase, will be one that has ongoing farm reorganization and that is \ninterested in participating in the pilot project. \n \n14.  The TA will require 27 person-months of consulting services (15 international and 12 \ndomestic). International consultants will give technical advice to the task force in the development \nwork and the pilot test. The international consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB \nthrough a consulting firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Use of Consultants and \nusing the quality- and cost-based selection method. Consultants will submit simplified technical \nproposals. The international consultants will have experts in land administration, system analysis \nand  design,  and  cadastral  surveying.  The  domestic  consultants  who  will  develop  the \ncomputerized system will be hired from a local information technology consulting firm. They will \nbe selected at the system development phase, in accordance with procedures acceptable to \nADB, through a review of their qualifications for system development using the procured software. \nThe  consultants  shall  procure  all  equipment  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. Outline terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 3. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months from November 2003 and will be completed \nby December 2004. The consultants will submit an inception report, including a detailed work \nplan, within the first month. A progress report will be submitted every 3 months after each of \nthese phases: (i) investigations and design, (ii) development and installation, (iii) pilot testing, and \n(iv) evaluation of the pilot test. A draft final report will be prepared and submitted after the 11th \nmonth, comments from ADB and the EA on the draft will be received within 3 weeks after its \nsubmission, and the final version of the report, incorporating the comments, will be delivered \nwithin 1 month after the TA is completed. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Uzbekistan for Developing an Integrated Cadastre System for Land Resources \nManagement and Property Right Registration, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
