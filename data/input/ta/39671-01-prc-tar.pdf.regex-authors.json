During  the  Country  Programming  Midterm  Review  Mission  in  April  2007,  the \nGovernment  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  confirmed  its  request  for  technical \nassistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for a Transport Information System.1 \nAn ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited the PRC on 26\u201329 June 2007 and discussed with officials \nof the Government the use of an information system to increase capacity, efficiency, and quality \nof road transport. This report is based on the understanding reached with the Government on \nthe scope and output of the TA, cost estimates, a financing plan, consultants\u2019 terms of reference, \nand implementation arrangements. \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n2.  The development of expressways and other road networks has contributed greatly to the \nPRC\u2019s economic development. Rapid economic growth has changed the structure of urban \nareas, which contribute 80% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Urban areas have been \nchanged, not only by economic development but also by migration from the rural areas. In a \nsingle generation, 300 million to 400 million people have moved from the countryside to the city. \nThe urban share of the total population grew from 26% in 1990 to almost 40% in 2005. This shift \nbrought suburban development to many cities, making biking and walking less feasible and \nrapidly increasing the number of people who need an efficient public transport. The continuing \nshift to private cars with urbanization is causing the quality of service and efficiency of public \ntransport to deteriorate.  \n \n3.  Rapid economic growth also brings increased freight traffic. Highway freight traffic is \nincreasing at almost the same rate as GDP growth, or about 10% per annum from 2003 to 2006. \nThe total length of the expressway network increased by 20% from 2004 to 2005 and by 9.5% \nfrom 2005 to 2006. During that time the total length of roads other than expressways increased \nby just 5% annually. Freight transport, especially interprovince and international traffic, relies \nheavily on the expressway network, but total road investment has lagged behind the growth of \nfreight transport. Logistical costs (transport, warehousing, administration, and inventory) are \nthought to account for 30\u201340% of the total cost of manufactured goods in the PRC, much more \nthan the 5\u201320% in the United States. Expanding the expressways is not catching up to the \ndemand  of  freight  transport.  To  ensure  efficient  and  reliable  freight  transport  and  public \ntransport, new measures are required.  \n \n4.  In parallel with economic growth, the number of vehicles on the roads has grown rapidly. \nWith development, the PRC has become the world\u2019s second largest oil consumer and the \nworld\u2019s largest carbon dioxide-emitting country in 2006. Vehicles account for about 30% of the \ntotal oil consumption in the PRC, and this amount is projected to reach 57% in 2020. Without \nincreasing the efficiency of transport, transport in the PRC would contribute to worsen the \nissues of energy security and the environment, both locally and globally. \n \n5.  In response to the issues and the emerging demand for road transport, the Government \nis keen to increase the capacity and efficiency of road transport by utilizing newly available \ntechnology.  In  many  businesses  and  governments  around  the  world,  the  construction  and \noperation  of  transportation  systems  are  being  transformed  by  computers,  sensors,  and \ncommunications technology\u2014collectively called information technology (IT). The application of \nIT to surface transportation is called intelligent transport system (ITS). ITS provides the ability to \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 24 April 2007. \n ", "2   \ngather, organize, analyze, use, and share information about transportation systems. In the \nmodern world, this ability is crucial to the effective and economical operation of transportation \nsystems and to their efficient use. Not only IT can be very helpful in conceiving, planning, and \nbuilding  new  parts  of  the  transport  system;  ITS  also  provides  vital  support  in  operating \ntransportation systems, including traffic management, oversight of system maintenance, and \nmore effectively and reliably managing public transport. The support provided by ITS helps \nincrease the capacity of existing road infrastructure, efficiency of road transport, and quality \ntransport service. \n \n6.  The Ministry of Communications (MOC) started research and development of ITS in the \n1990s and developed the ITS strategic program. In the past decade, MOC in cooperation with \nrelated organizations deployed a few ITS applications such as electronic toll collection and \nweather information service. In the 11th Five-Year Plan (11FYP) (2006\u20132010), the Government \nstated that it would continue with ITS deployment to improve transport service, infrastructure \nmanagement, and national economic development, specifically (i) to promote integration of the \nelectronic information network with physical infrastructure to maximize the efficiency, safety, and \nutilization of infrastructure, and to make road transport a link to encourage the integration of \ntransportation  modes  for  different  users  with  more  choices;  (ii)  to  relieve  congestion  and \nincrease the capacity of the transportation system by providing information for transportation \nsystem operators and road users, and to minimize new infrastructure construction; and (iii) to \nminimize the probability and severity of collisions, respond to and handle accidents faster, and \nreduce accident losses to the extent possible. To achieve the objective in 11FYP, MOC is \nfocused  on  developing  a  travel  information  service  system  (TISS)  as  one  of  the  strategic \nprograms in the road transport sector at the moment. TISS will provide various information \nsupporting traveler decisions on intended trips: information about routes, traffic situation and \ndestination  before  and  during  the  trips.  Information  provision  with  TISS  will  increase  the \nefficiency of road transport and the use of the existing road infrastructure.  \n \n7.  Over 2005\u20132006, TISS has been initiated in five demonstration provinces/cities, each of \nwhich started to establish its own TISS. However, there is neither a uniform standard for \ninformation service and operation mode nor an information-sharing system. MOC requested TA \nto establish standards for TISS. Without a proper standard and an information-sharing system, \ninteroperability between TISS in different areas/cities and expansion to new areas cannot be \nattained. By specifying how the standard would promote interoperability and expandability and \nwhat are the required standards for TISS, TISS will be introduced using a systematic and \neconomical approach. Standardization will have a good effect: it will open markets, encourage \ncompetition, and ensure integration, quality, and efficiency as well. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The expected impact of the TA is increased capacity of the existing road infrastructure, \nan  efficient  road  transport,  and  quality  transport  service.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  is \nrecommendations on how the PRC should deploy ITS and TISS, assistance to MOC to develop \na standard architecture framework of TISS, and implementing and operating guidelines.  \n \n9.  The outcomes will be achieved by (i) reviewing the current status of ITS in the PRC \nincluding  existing  strategies,  policies,  and  plans  on  ITS,  and  related  laws,  regulations, \ninstitutions, and standards; (ii) reviewing systems similar to TISS in developed countries; (iii) \nidentifying key issues and recommendations; (iv) preparing recommendations for PRC\u2019s ITS \n ", "  3\nand  TISS;  (v)  preparing  a  standard  architecture  framework  of  TISS;  (vi)  preparing  TISS \nimplementing and operating guidelines; (vii) building capacity through workshops and training \nprograms;  and (viii) disseminating the results through publication for related agencies and \nstakeholders. The design and monitoring framework outlining the expected impact, outcomes, \noutputs, and activities is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  International and national consultants will be engaged to help the Government study the \ntransport information system. They will also assist MOC to develop recommendations on how \nthe  PRC  should  deploy  ITS  and  TISS,  a  standard  architecture  framework  of  TISS,  and \nimplementing and operating guidelines. The TA will be carried out in close consultation with \nprovincial governments and the central Government agencies concerned and will take into \naccount  all  previous  studies  carried  out  by  the  Government,  ADB,  and  other  multilateral \nagencies,  as  well  as  best  international  practice.  The  TA  will  involve  fieldwork,  gathering \ninternational  experience,  analytical  research,  stakeholder  consultations  with  national  and \nprovincial  governments  and  agencies  responsible  for  road  transport  and  road  users,  and \ntraining for building the capacity of government staff to implement the TA outputs.  \n \n11,  The TA will include case studies that exemplify typical issues in the PRC regarding \ndeployment of TISS. MOC and ADB will select from five demonstration provinces/cities (para. 7) \nsubjects for the case studies, which are making progress and willing to cooperate with the TA. \nThe selected provinces should be cooperative and have sufficient information and data for their \nparticular case study. The case studies will entail in-depth study of the current state and key \nissues. The case studies will also apply developed standard architecture framework of TISS and \nimplementing and operating guidelines.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent. It will be financed as a \ngrant from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government requested ADB to finance $400,000. \nMOC will finance the remaining $100,000 equivalent, which will cover office accommodation \nand counterpart staff required to implement the TA. The detailed cost estimate is in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The TA will require about 34 person-months of consulting services (4 international and \n30 national) including fieldwork spread over a period of 8 months. A national consulting firm in \nassociation  with  an  international  consultant  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  using  the  simplified \ntechnical proposal procedures and quality- and cost-based selection method on the quality-cost \nratio of 80 to 20 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). The international consultants will provide expertise in ITS. The \nnational  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  (i)  road  planning;  (ii)  ITS,  especially  system \narchitecture; (iii) road and traffic information database; and (iv) transport standard/regulation. A \nnational ITS expert will be the team leader and an international consultant will be the deputy \nteam leader. Appendix 3 presents the outline terms of reference for the consultants.  \n \n14.  MOC will be the Executing Agency. It will be responsible for guiding and supervising the \nTA activities and for coordinating with relevant Government agencies and organizations. MOC \nwill (i) ensure cooperation of the concerned Government agencies, and (ii) provide guidance \nand assistance to the consultants in implementing the TA. To develop capacity, the consultants \n ", "4   \nwill (i) develop and implement a domestic training program, and (ii) identify suitable international \ntraining opportunities and coordinate and arrange international training. The TA is expected to \nbegin  in  March  2008  and  be  completed  by  October  2008.2 The  international and  national \nconsultants will also conduct workshops for consultation with stakeholders and dissemination of \ninformation. MOC will provide the consultants with all relevant materials, recent studies, and \nreports required for the TA. The consultants will maintain close contact with MOC and ADB and \nwill keep them informed of the TA progress and findings. A tripartite meeting of the Government, \nADB staff, and the consultants will be held to elicit comments on a draft final report and guide \nthe consultants in finalizing it. Equipment provided under the TA will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and will be handed \nover to MOC upon completion of the TA.  \n \n15.  The consultants will submit the following reports to ADB and MOC as scheduled in the \ndesign and monitoring framework (Appendix 1): (i) a list of sources of information, a list of \nrelated regulations, and a list of related organizations and contact persons, 2 weeks after the \nstart of the services; (ii) an inception report, including an outline of the final report, 4 weeks \nfollowing the start of the services; (iii) an interim report 16 weeks after the start; (iii) a draft final \nreport within 26 weeks of the start; and (iv) a final report 2 weeks after receiving all comments \nfrom MOC and ADB. The consultants will hold a stakeholder consultation workshop within 8 \nweeks of the start of services, and a national workshop in Beijing, within 4 weeks of the \nsubmission of the draft final report, to disseminate TA findings. The inception report, interim \nreport, draft final report, and final report\u2015three copies of each (in English and Chinese)\u2015will be \nsubmitted  to  ADB,  MOC,  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission. A draft outline of the consultant\u2019s final report is in Appendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n16.
