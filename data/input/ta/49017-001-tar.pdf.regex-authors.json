INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested policy and \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the \nMinistry of Education (MOE) in reforming modes of education in applied tertiary institutions to \npromote graduate employment.1 The reforms will focus on local higher education institutions \n(HEIs) to improve linkages with local economies, and they will help improve the desirability of \ntertiary technical and vocational education among students. The TA will support the MOE in \nidentifying  reform  pathways  adapted  to  local  contexts.2 During  a  reconnaissance  mission \nconducted  in  March  2015,  the  ADB  project  team  conducted  consultations  and  reached \nagreement with the MOE on the TA project\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, costs, implementation \nand  financing  arrangements,  and  the  terms  of  reference  for  consultants.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The number of university graduates in the PRC has increased from 2.12 million in 2003 \nto 7.49 million in 2015 as a result of both demographic trends and the government\u2019s decision in \n1999  to  expand  tertiary  education  to  stimulate  the  economy.3 Given  the  PRC\u2019s  slowing \neconomic growth and its transformation into a service-oriented economy driven by domestic \nconsumption, policy makers are increasingly concerned about job creation being too weak to \nkeep pace with the rising numbers of graduates. The unemployment rate for recent college \ngraduates aged 21\u201325 is 16%, which (i) is nearly four times that of blue-collar workers in urban \nareas, and (ii) masks significant bias in rural and female student recruitment. In addition, as the \neconomy  transitions  toward  higher  levels  of  economic  development,  policy  makers  are \npreoccupied  with  widening  skills  gaps.  Many  university  graduates  remain  underemployed \nseveral months after gaining employment, and employers are often unable to find employees \nwith relevant and appropriate skills. \n \n3.  National priorities for the education sector were reiterated during the National People\u2019s \nCongress  held  in  March 2015.  This  was  followed  by  State  Council  legislation  issued                        \non 30 May 2015.4 Two key priorities for higher education have emerged. The first is to improve \npolicies aimed at stimulating employment and supporting self-employment and entrepreneurship \namong college and university graduates. The government has already begun implementing \nrelated  policies  such  as  (i) providing  employment  opportunities  in  grassroots  communities, \n(ii) encouraging  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises  and  nonpublic  enterprises  to  employ \ncollege graduates, (iii) encouraging key state-owned enterprises and research projects to recruit \ncollege graduates, (iv) encouraging college graduates to start their own business, (v) improving \nor reforming employment services available to college graduates, (vi) enhancing employability, \nand  (vii) assisting  disadvantaged  college  graduates  in  job  placement.5 The  government  is \n                                                \n1  The overall objective is the transformation of more than 600 HEIs into polytechnics, but the MOE has indicated that \nit will pilot transitions first in selected HEIs. Applied tertiary institutions or polytechnics are institutions that offer \ndegrees in paraprofessional majors and a variety of employment-oriented majors. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 June 2015. \n3  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Ministry of Education. 2013. Key Education Statistics. Beijing. \n4  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, General Office of the State Council. 2015. State Council Gazette \nIssue No. 15. \u201cImplementation Opinions of the General Office of State Council on Deepening the Reform of the \nEducation of Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Institutions of Higher Education.\u201d Serial No. 1518. Beijing. \n5  These  employment  opportunities  include  (i) the \u201cthree supports and one assistance\u201d plan, which focuses on \neducation service, agriculture activities, public health service, and poverty reduction in rural areas; and (ii) the \n\u201cspecial posts of rural teachers\u201d plan, including through the \u201ccollege students volunteer to the west\u201d program. \n ", "2   \n \nincreasing its attention on self-employment and entrepreneurship as a means of promoting \nemployment and fostering innovation.  \n \n4.  The second priority is to reform HEIs so they are better able to contribute to these \npolicies and respond to current as well as future economic and social needs. Specific emphasis \nis  put  on  local  HEIs  (particularly  lower  tier  universities)  to  improve  education  quality  and \nrelevance, particularly to strengthen local economies and rural\u2013urban transitions. Developing \nand retaining talent in the western provinces and in rural areas is part of the country\u2019s education \nsector policy, an important feature of which is the strengthening of applied HEIs. Under this \napproach, a number of local HEIs are being encouraged to transform into applied colleges or \npolytechnics. The objective is to promote education opportunities that better prepare students \nfor  gainful  employment.  Although  the  policy  to  transform  HEIs  into  applied  colleges  or \npolytechnics has been set, the modalities of its implementation have yet to be established, as \nreforming existing HEIs is a complex undertaking that the MOE intends to pilot first. \n \n5.  The reforms are also expected to help change students\u2019 perceptions of higher education \nand subsequent employment opportunities. While they currently favor university education over \ntertiary  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training,  tertiary  technical  and  vocational \neducation  and  training  will  become  more  attractive  to  students  by  improving  the  linkages \nbetween  the  academic  and  technical  streams  and  by  strengthening  applied  colleges  or \npolytechnics. A more applied tertiary education would better prepare graduates for employment \nand  could  help  them  adjust  their  employment  expectations  to  match  current  labor  market \nrealities.6 \n \n6.  The proposed TA is a timely response to the government\u2019s current priorities. It will focus \non the institutional reform of HEIs and support the transition of selected HEIs in the western and \nsouthern provinces toward applied colleges. By strengthening such HEIs, it will encourage \ngraduate employment in local urban and rural areas, and in lagging central and western regions. \nThe TA will also facilitate dialogue among stakeholders, particularly among colleges, employers, \ngraduates, and local policy makers. The TA is intended to provide guidance on the deployment \nof the applied college concept in the PRC and showcase successful examples, which will \ncontribute to the national policy framework for reforming tertiary education. The TA will also be \nuseful to other countries in the region. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be an increase in employment-ready college graduates in the targeted \nprovinces  and  sectors  and  a  shift  in  students\u2019  attitudes  regarding  higher  education  and \nemployment.  The  outcome  will  be  successful  planning  for  the  transformation  of  HEIs  into \napplied colleges, which will be evidenced by the MOE\u2019s adaptation of guidelines and a road \nmap  for  the  transformation  of  selected  HEIs  into  applied  colleges  by  March  2017.7 The \nrecommendations  for  implementing  the  transformation  plan  will  also  propose  ways  to \nincorporate impact evaluation mechanisms in the process to better inform policy makers. Given \n                                                \n6  A. Moorman. 2011. Changing Student Expectations and Graduate Employment. Frontiers of Education in China:  \nCase Studies from Xi\u2019an, Shaanxi Province. 6 (4). pp. 521\u2013548. \n7  Under this TA, about eight to 10 HEIs will be selected from among two to three provinces in the southern and \nwestern regions. The MOE recommended (and ADB agreed) considering HEIs in Baise, where there is an ADB \nloan project ongoing, and western provinces such as Xinjiang, Gansu, or Qinghai. \n ", "  3 \n \nthe importance of fostering employment in the western and central parts of the country to \npromote balanced development, the proposed TA will concentrate on the regions and sectors \nmost likely to contribute to local economic development and generate employment locally (e.g., \nlocal industry, modernized agriculture, medical occupations). The TA will determine how to \nreplicate proposed HEI reforms and adapt to local contexts, and it will seek out good practices \ndeveloped in other parts of the PRC as well as around the world. The TA will pay particular \nattention to small cities and rural areas to assess how HEIs could assist in the modernization of \nagriculture and green jobs, or in the development of services, including elderly care, information \nand communication technology, and e-commerce, to support social and economic improvement. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will conduct in-depth stakeholder consultations to understand the socioeconomic \ncontext  and  institutional  setting  in  which  HEIs  operate,  and  review  the  relevance  and \napplicability  of  national  and  international  experience  in  developing  applied  colleges               \n(e.g., community colleges, polytechnics). Drawing on the above findings, the TA will identify \ngood practices for transitioning HEIs toward applied colleges, and assemble the analyses and \nrecommendations in eight to 10 case studies. \n \n9.  The proposed TA will also address the specific employment experiences of women, rural \nmigrants, and ethnic minorities. For instance, working women\u2019s needs for child and elderly care \nmay affect their career path. Additionally, stereotypes and social factors influence fields of study; \nemployment legislation and entitlements; and entrepreneurship capacities (e.g., access to credit) \nand prospects of women, rural migrants, and minorities. Similarly, social networking and the \ncreation  of  social  capital  are  important  dimensions  of  successful  job  search  and  business \ncreation, but are often overlooked by policy makers. Awareness of these issues and how, if at \nall, HEIs integrate them when developing employment services for their graduates have an \nimportant bearing on HEIs\u2019 ability to foster equity. The TA will identify strategies for HEIs to \nimprove linkages and foster collaboration with local economies, and contribute to employment \n(and self-employment) generation. The TA will also identify opportunities for HEIs to encourage \napplied research with local companies (e.g., in support of modernizing agriculture) to help \naccelerate the contribution of local economic development and employment generation. \n \n10.  The TA will have three outputs: (i) local HEIs mapped, (ii) selected HEIs and their \ncapacity  to  implement  the  transition  toward  a  polytechnic  model  assessed,  and                        \n(iii) recommendations to guide the phased strategy of the MOE and provincial governments to \nimplement the transition toward a polytechnic model provided. \n \n11.  Output 1 will provide a detailed mapping of the current local HEI system in the PRC to \ninform the selection process of the HEIs that will be featured in the case studies. The mapping \nwill be established through a desk review and in-depth consultations with the MOE and local \nstakeholders, including review of any other planning or strategy work being undertaken on HEI \ntransition guidelines. It will identify the pilot cases and sectors that will most likely contribute to \nlocal  economic  development  and  generate  employment  locally.  At  the  close  of  the  initial \nstakeholder consultation phase, the eight to 10 HEIs to be included in the case studies will have \nbeen selected and will include HEIs focusing on various sectors (such as medical services, \nagriculture, and industrial organization). \n \n12.  Output 2 will draw on the findings of output 1 and consist of a detailed assessment of the \nselected HEIs and their capacity to implement the transition toward a polytechnic model. A \nmidterm review workshop will be organized with key stakeholders to provide a platform to share \n ", "4   \n \na provisional report, preliminary findings from the initial stakeholder consultation phase, and the \ninstitutional analyses of the selected HEIs. The workshop will bring together stakeholders to \nstrengthen HEI networks and enable horizontal knowledge and experience sharing.  \n \n13.  Output 3 will provide a set of comprehensive recommendations to guide the phased \nstrategy of the MOE and provincial governments to implement the transition toward applied \ncolleges.  Sector-specific  suggestions  (e.g.,  for  colleges  focusing  on  medical  services, \nagriculture, and industry) and recommendations to address gender issues relating to higher \neducation and the transition toward employment will be included whenever relevant. As reliable \nimpact  evaluation  helps  validate  and  strengthen  findings,  the  recommendations  will  also \nsuggest mechanisms through which the overall impact of the transition could be assessed. \nInitial findings from the eight to 10 case studies will be presented during an interim meeting with \npolicy makers, stakeholders, and prominent academics and researchers to obtain feedback. \nDraft recommendations to support the transformation of selected HEIs into applied colleges, \nincluding specific recommendations for a possible project to implement reforms in several HEIs, \nwill be discussed at a final TA workshop. Key findings and conclusions will be published in a TA \ncase study report targeting an audience of policy makers and higher education practitioners in \nthe PRC, as well as in other developing member countries of ADB. \n \n14.  Major risks to the successful completion of the proposed TA include the following: (i) the \nspeed of government policy decisions overtakes project findings, (ii) local governments and \nHEIs are not ready to participate in the consultation process, and (iii) there are no resource \ntransfers  for  local  governments  and  HEIs  to  follow  through  with  the  proposed  TA \nrecommendations. To mitigate the risks, local consultants will be recruited and a network of \nlocal experts leading several HEIs will be created to (i) help develop an in-depth understanding \nof the sociocultural terrain, (ii) lead consultations throughout the process in close consultation \nwith decision makers, and (iii) provide interim and final recommendations in a timely manner. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, policy documents and guidelines, \nstatistical data, information, office space, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The  executing  agency  for  the  project  is  the  MOE\u2019s  Department  of  Comprehensive \nReforms. A steering group comprising relevant departments of the MOE, certain provincial \nrepresentatives,  and  prominent  academics  from  top-tier  universities  will  be  established  to \nprovide guidance during the TA and throughout implementation. The TA will be implemented \nfrom 15 September 2015 to 31 March 2017. \n \n17.  The TA will fund a national consultant and a consulting firm with demonstrated expertise \nin higher education and in-depth knowledge of the country context. The national consultant will \nensure continuity of this work with the ongoing TA.8 The national expert, who will be familiar with \nthe ongoing TA content and research, will provide specialized insights to the TA and consulting \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2014.

The \nnational consultant (6 person-months) will be engaged  on an individual basis. Services to \nsupport consultations, workshops, and surveys will also be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) and Procurement \nGuidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  consulting  firm  will  undertake  the \nassessment of HEIs and prepare the case studies, working closely with the national consultant, \nand will be responsible for preparing the interim and final reports. The consulting firm will be \nselected under a fixed-budget selection method, with an estimated budget of $250,000. Given \nthe experimental and pilot approaches required to identify specific issues confronting HEIs in \ntheir transformation into polytechnics, this method is most appropriate and will be used to draw \non the expertise of the consulting firm to adopt the best possible approach and methodology. \n \n18.  The TA will also engage around six to eight resource persons (national and international \nhigher education experts, totaling 2 person-months) to contribute to the TA in an advisory role, \npeer review progress report, and/or participate in workshops. Additionally, ADB staff could also \nbe engaged as facilitators or resource persons. \n \n19.  The consultants will be selected based on their academic qualifications and relevant \nwork experience. The consultants under the TA will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The terms of \nreference (Appendix 3) outline their tasks. All procurement under the TA will be carried out in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Proceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time).  \n \n20.  The findings of the TA will be disseminated to stakeholders during the course of the TA \nand at the final workshop. Interim findings will be shared locally at workshops that will bring \ntogether leaders and key staff of the HEIs, and recommendations will be shared nationally \nthrough consultations and workshops. Resource persons have been included in the TA to \nprovide policy advice during dissemination. The findings will directly contribute to the policy \ndevelopment on tertiary education reforms led by the MOE. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Policy Analysis and Assessment of \nReforming  Education  Mode  for  Promoting  Employment  of  Graduates  in  Applied  Tertiary \nInstitutions, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the Project is aligned with: \n \nEmployment-ready college graduates in the targeted provinces and sectors increased (National Outline for \nMedium and Long-term Education Reform and Development, 2010\u20132020a) \nStudents\u2019 attitudes regarding higher education and employment shifted (National Outline for Medium and \nLong-term Education Reform and Development, 2010\u20132020a) \n \nPerformance Indicators \nwith Targets and \nProject Results Chain  Baselines  Data Sources and Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nHEIs\u2019 transformation  Guidelines and a road map  One-off report on the  The government \ninto applied colleges  for the transformation of  recommendations proposal  delays its plans \nsuccessfully planned  selected HEIs into applied  issued at the end of the TA by  for transitioning \ncolleges adapted by the  the MOE\u2019s Department of  HEIs toward \nMOE by March 2017  Comprehensive Reforms titled  applied colleges \n(baseline 2014 = 0)  \u201cTransforming Higher \nEducation Institutions into \nApplied Colleges\u201d \nOutputs       \n1.
