The Project will provide \nemployment-oriented  skills  training  in  various  occupations  to \nmake the prospective Maldivian employee more attractive to the \nemployer.  In  the  process,  in-country  capacity  to  deliver \ncompetency-based skills training will be strengthened. Together \nwith the provision of employment-oriented skills training, career \nguidance in schools and social marketing will contribute to making \ntraining  and  employment  more  attractive  to  the  prospective \nMaldivian employee.   \n \nTraining  in  the  Project  will  be  delivered  in  three  geographic \nregions, namely, Mal\u00e9 island and adjacent atolls, the Northern \nDevelopment  Region,  and  the  Southern  Development  Region. \nThe  Project  will  focus  on  delivering  training  in  four  sectors: \ntourism,  fisheries  and  agriculture,  transport,  and  the  social \nsectors. \n   \nRationale  National economic development requires the efficient employment \nof  all  national  resources,  including  human  resources.  The \nemployment of more Maldivians means that they would be able to \nshare in the benefits of and participate in economic development, \nand is a sustainable approach to poverty reduction. Between 1995 \nand 2000, the Maldives\u2019 economy grew at an annual average of \n8%.  During  this  time  the  Maldivian  labor  force  grew  by  5% \nannually while expatriate labor grew 8%. The Maldives is highly \ndependent on skilled expatriate labor. Employers, including the \nGovernment, hire expatriate workers in the absence of properly \ntrained and qualified Maldivians. This is against the backdrop of \nuntapped  domestic  human  resources,  which  include  the  large \nnumber  of  youths  who  are  not  in  the  labor  force,  who  have \ncompleted primary education but could not continue on to further \neducation, and who are capable but have limited access to skills \ntraining programs. \n   \n ", "iv   \n   \nObjective  The overall objective of the Project is to increase the number of \nMaldivians, men and women, actively participating in the labor \nforce  and  employed.  The  Project  will  (i) provide  youths  with \nemployment-oriented  skills  training;  (ii) increase  capacity  to \ndesign, develop, and deliver employment-oriented skills training; \n(iii) improve  public  perception  of  training  and  employment  in \nlocally available skills-oriented occupations; and (iv) strengthen \nlabor administration and labor market analysis. The Project aims \nto train about 6,000 youths, at least 40% of whom will be female.  \n \nThe Project will have three components: (i) increasing access to \ngood  quality  employment-oriented  skills  training;  (ii) social \nmarketing,  and  improving  career  guidance  and  awareness  of \nemployment opportunities; and (iii) capacity strengthening of the \nMinistry of Human Resources, Employment and Labor (MHREL).  \n   \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $7.5 million equivalent, \nincluding physical contingency and price escalation, taxes and \nduties,  and  interest  charges,  of  which  $2.1 million  equivalent \n(28%)  comprises  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $5.4 million \nequivalent  (72%)  comprises  the  local  currency  cost.  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will finance 80% of the project cost. \nThis covers 100% of the foreign exchange cost and 72% of the \nlocal  currency  cost.  The  Government  will  provide  $1.5 million \nequivalent (20%).  \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  % \n  Exchange  Currency  Cost   \nADB  2.1  3.9  6.0  80 \nGovernment  0.0  1.5  1.5  20 \nTotal  2.1  5.4  7.5  100 \n%  28  72  100   \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  SDR  4,196,000 \n($6 million) equivalent from its Special Funds resources. The loan \nwill have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, \nwith an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 March 2009  \n   \nEstimated Project  30 September 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \n   \n ", "  v\nImplementation  The  project  implementing  agency  will  be  MHREL.  A  project \nArrangements  steering committee will be established to facilitate policy dialogue, \nadvise the project manager of concerns and issues related to all \naspects  of  project  implementation,  and  facilitate  coordination \nbetween ministries and agencies. A project implementation unit \nwill  be  established.  Working  groups  will  be  organized  to \ncoordinate and guide the implementation of project components \nand activities. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Finance and Treasury \n   \nProcurement  The procurement of goods and services financed by ADB will be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement \nreflecting ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and mandatory use of ADB\u2019s \nstandard bidding documents. \n   \nConsulting Services  The selection and engagement of all consulting services to be \nfinanced  under  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. \nA team of consultants to provide services in a range of specialties \nwith  estimated  international  inputs  of  28  person-months  and \ndomestic inputs of 50 person-months will be engaged through a \nfirm using the quality and cost-based selection method. Another \n4 person-months  of  international  inputs  for  services  in  labor \nadministration will be provided by an individual consultant. In case \nthe  expertise  for  domestic  inputs  is  not  locally  available, \ninternational consultants will be used. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  main  project  benefits  are:  (i) more  youths  provided  with \nBeneficiaries  employment-oriented skills training; (ii) more skilled Maldivians in \nthe labor force sharing in the benefits of economic development; \n(iii) increased capacity in country to design, develop, and deliver \ndemand-oriented  skills  training;  (iv) strengthened  labor \nadministration and labor market analysis at MHREL. The direct \nbeneficiaries  of  the  Project  will  be:  (i) unemployed  youths, \nincluding  women;  (ii) island  communities;  (iii) various  ministries \nand  agencies  addressing  the  issues  of  the  youths,  human \nresources development, and training delivery; and (iv) public and \nprivate training providers. \n \nBenefits to the country will accrue through human development \nthat is necessary for economic growth.  The provision of skilled \nlabor will also contribute to meeting the macroeconomic goals of \nthe country, notably addressing the balance of payments and \nretention of foreign exchange. \n   \n ", "vi   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project assumes mainly that the economy of the Maldives will \ncontinue to grow and create new jobs. In addition, it assumes that: \n(i) employers  will  be  motivated  to  hire  more  skilled  Maldivian \nworkers;  (ii) Maldivian  youths  will  actively  seek  employment, \nincluding in occupations other than white-collar, and seek training; \nand (iii) stakeholders will cooperate and coordinate in a timely and \nconstructive manner. The proposed Project aims to mitigate these \nrisks  by:  (i) developing  and  delivering  training  that  is oriented \ntoward the needs of the labor market; (ii) building the capacity of \nMHREL for more effective monitoring and implementation of labor \nregulations and labor market analysis; (iii) implementing a social \nmarketing program aimed not only at students but also at parents \nand communities and delivering a career guidance program in \nsecondary  schools;  (iv) having  a  wide  representation  on  the \nproject steering committee, in employment sector councils, as well \nas  coordination  efforts  through  the  Maldives  Network  for \nEmployment Training and the project implementation unit; and \n(v) actively  encouraging  dialogue  with  and  participation  of  the \nprivate sector in project implementation. \n   \n \n \n   \n ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of the Maldives for the Employment Skills Training Project (ESTP).1 \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The Republic of the Maldives is a nation of over 270,000 people living on 199 islands in \nan archipelago 820 kilometers long and 120 kilometers wide. As of 2002, almost half of the \npopulation (46%) was less than 15 years old. Twenty-seven percent of the population live in the \nnational capital island of Mal\u00e9 while the rest live on 198 inhabited islands. In addition there are \n87 tourist resort islands that are annually the home of 6,500 Maldivians, 3,400 expatriate \nworkers, and over 450,000 foreign tourists. The Government is committed to sustainable human \ndevelopment, which is reflected in its allocation of 40% of public expenditures to social services \nin 2001. The human development index for the Maldives is 0.739, ranking it 77th out of 162 \ncountries, and the gender development index, at 0.735, is second only to that of Sri Lanka in \nSouth Asia.2  \n \n3.  High and rising per capita income3 masks significant income disparities. According to the \n1998 Vulnerability and Poverty Assessment,4 as many as 42% of Maldivians live on less than \n$1.17 per day while 22% subsist on $0.83 per day. Income disparities between Mal\u00e9 and the \natolls are in the order of 2:1. Inequalities are more pronounced in access to social and physical \ninfrastructure and services, which averaged 4:1. This is a challenge that the Government has \nsought to address since the 1970s, which today has resulted in policy initiatives to develop \ngrowth center islands in five regions to reduce disparities in access to essential services. The \nGovernment, with assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), is developing the \nNorthern and Southern Development regions. \n \n4.  In 2002, the three largest sectors of the economy were tourism (31%), transport and \ncommunications (14%), and government administration (12%). Fisheries used to account for \naround 7.8% of gross domestic product (GDP), but its share has declined to 7.1%; the related \nsecondary sector activity, fish preparation, accounts for about 3.0% of GDP. The share of the \nsocial sectors\u2014education, health, and social services\u2014is slowly shrinking: from 2.6% in 1995, it \nwas  2.0%  in  2002.  Commodity  exports  in  2002  were  mostly  marine  products  (62%). \nDependence on tourism, primary exports, and expatriate workers, contributes to the economy\u2019s \nhigh vulnerability to external shocks.  \n \n5.  Labor Force. According to the 2000 Population and Housing Census (Census), only \n56% of working-age Maldivians were in the labor force,5 with about a third of them employed in \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

The Maldives Vulnerability and Poverty Assessment 1998.  \n  Available: http://www.mv.undp.org/docs/VPA1998. \n5  The 2000 Population and Housing Census took 12 as the eligible age for employment. As of May 2003, the legal \nage for working and labor regulation was raised to 18. Throughout this report, we use 15 to 64 as reference ages \nfor the labor force. The reference period used for employment in the 2000 Census was \u201clast week,\u201d which may lead \nto the understatement of unemployment and labor force participation. \n ", "2    \nMal\u00e9.6 The official unemployment rate is 1% for the entire population. Men are almost twice as \nlikely to be in the labor force as women, 73% against 38%. Youths7 aged 15 to 19 are the least \nlikely to be in the labor force, 24% of the cohort, while 64% of those aged 20 to 34 participate. \nThe largest employer of Maldivians is the Government and government companies, mainly in \ncommunity, social, and personal services; manufacturing; hotels and restaurants; and fishing. \nIsland women are mostly in community, social, and personal services, and manufacturing. Few \nwomen are employed in fishing, or in hotels and restaurants. The Maldivian labor force is \nsignificantly augmented by expatriate workers. The share of expatriate workers in the total labor \nforce increased from 13% in 1990 (8,700 workers) to 24% in 2000 (30,664 workers). According \nto the 2000 Census, expatriates are mostly employed in unskilled (42%) and semiskilled (36%) \noccupations.  More  than  80%  are  employed  in  resorts,  construction,  business  activities, \neducation,  apparel,  and  hotels  and  restaurants.  Most  of  the  expatriate  workers  are  from \nBangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka. Expatriate remuneration packages include accommodations \nand once-a-year airfare to the home country. Even with extra benefits and expenses incurred by \nemployers, expatriate workers in some categories receive about 80% to 85% of the Maldivians\u2019 \nsalary and benefits. The employment of large numbers of expatriate workers, in spite of the high \nlevels of unemployment and underemployment, implies a significant wastage of the Maldives\u2019 \nhuman resources potential. A key reason for this anomaly is the dearth of adequately educated \nand trained Maldivians to meet the needs of employers and the reluctance of some Maldivians \nto engage in less skilled occupations. The ESTP addresses this issue and seeks to increase the \nnumber of Maldivians in the labor force by increasing access to employment oriented skills \ntraining programs (see Appendix 1). \n \n6.  Education. In the Maldives, public education is tuition-free for primary grades 1 to 7, \nlower secondary grades 8 to 10, and higher secondary grades 11 to 12. Appendix 2 discusses \nthe education and skills training sectors. As of 2000, all children in the Maldives have access to \nthe first 7 years of formal schooling, one of the landmark achievements of the country. The adult \nliteracy rate is 99%. The cost of providing education in the Maldives remains high as students \nare scattered over 199 islands. However, high priority is placed on investing in education such \nthat the education budget represents 20% of the total government budgetary expenditure. In \n2002, there were 68,242 students enrolled in the primary grades, 23,903 in the lower secondary \ngrades, and 1,131 in the higher secondary grades. In 2000, there were 452 primary schools, 74 \nlower secondary schools, and 2 higher secondary schools. Efforts are under way to improve the \nquality of primary education by providing teacher training.   \n \n7.  Secondary  Education.  For  2002,  enrollment  data  for  grade  8  indicate  that  5,350 \nstudents or 36% of those enrolled in grade 7 the previous year in primary schools did not \ncontinue  on  to  secondary  schooling.  The  transition  rate  is  particularly  low  in  the  atolls. \nAdmission to secondary school requires successful completion of grade 7; however, limited \ncapacity in public secondary schools has necessitated the introduction of selection processes \nfor admission. Despite ongoing efforts to increase access to secondary education, geographic \nconditions still limit access to secondary education as the majority of schools are located in atoll \ncapitals and on larger islands of high population. At the end of grade 10, students typically take \nOrdinary-level  (O-level)  examinations.  The  pass  rate  in  most  subjects,  including  English, \nmathematics, and the sciences, is below 50%.8 Among those with O-level qualifications, few are \nable to go to higher secondary school. As of 2002, there were only four schools offering higher \nsecondary education, two in Mal\u00e9 and one each in the Northern and Southern Development \n                                                 \n6  The labor force data are collected by the Census, the most recent of which was in 2000. \n7  The project uses the Government of Maldives' classification of 16 to 34 year olds as \"youths.\" \n8  The pass rate for English in 2002 was 6%. \n   \n ", "    3 \nregions. Higher secondary grade 11 enrollment was 13% of those enrolled in grade 10 the \nprevious year.  \n \n8.  Skills Training. Access to preemployment skills training through public and private \nproviders is limited. Skills training in the Maldives is provided mainly by the Maldives College of \nHigher Education (MCHE) through its various faculties, including the Faculty of Engineering \nTechnology (FET), Faculty of Hospitality and Tourism Studies (FHTS), and the Center for \nMaritime Studies (CMS). In 2002, CMS dominated MCHE short-course enrollment with 2,103 \nstudents, or 82.1% of all MCHE short-course skills training. Maritime training is male-dominated, \nwith no female trainees enrolled. Enrollment in entry-level employment skills training through \nshort-courses offered by MCHE faculties other than CMS progressively declined from 2,839 in \n1998 to 818 in 2002. Trainees enrolled in short-term training pay fees that may cover learning \nmaterials and training delivery costs. In recent months, MCHE has received an increasing \nnumber of requests from atoll chiefs for short-term skills training that could be provided by FHTS \nand FET;  however, many of these requests cannot be met within their respective budgets. \nMCHE is presently receiving ADB assistance focused on developing diploma and advanced \ncertificate courses through faculty development and course reviews, and program accreditation.  \n \n9.  The Ministry of Education (MOE) coordinates and implements nonformal education \nprograms in the Maldives. Through the Center for Continuing Education, MOE provides basic \neducation for adults. Formerly known as the Non-Formal Education Center, the Center for \nContinuing Education provides courses for adults to complete primary school, improve English \nlanguage courses, and offered some courses such as secretarial skills development, training in \nearly childhood care and development, population education, and community awareness. The \nMinistry of Fisheries, Agriculture and Marine Resources conducts agriculture- and fisheries-\nrelated skills training. The Ministry of Youth and Sports (MYS) offers a variety of training \nactivities for youths. In addition to offering sports and recreational programs in its youth centers, \nMYS  provides  training  in  sports-coaching,  dressmaking,  and  hairdressing.  The  Ministry  of \nHuman Resources, Employment and Labor (MHREL) has initiated a skills development loan \nscheme to fund specialized training, such as Scuba dive master instruction. \n \n10.  In 2002, 66 private training providers were registered with MOE.9 Eighty-five percent \noffer computer instruction and approximately half are located in Mal\u00e9. Accurate enrollment data \non  trainees  are  not  available.  In  addition  to  private  education  and  training  firms,  many \nemployers provide in-house training programs and courses for their employees. Larger firms \nprovide scholarships and support the education and professional development of employees. \nThe contribution of private enterprise to skills training is significant; however, no qualitative and \nquantitative data are available on the number of trainees or financial investment in on-the-job \ntraining and professional development.  \n \n11.  In  October  2001,  the  Maldives  Accreditation  Board  (MAB)  was  formed  as  the \nadministrative  service  of  MOE  to  oversee  the  implementation  of  the  Maldives  National \nQualifications  Framework.  The  present  focus  of  the  MAB  is  dominated  by  academic \nqualifications. No framework exists for occupational standards, or for accreditation and delivery \nof vocational skills training. \n \n12.  Labor Regulation. MHREL\u2019s mandate includes (i) the formulation of a national human \nresources  development  (HRD)  policy;  (ii) the  development  of  strategies  and  programs  for \ntraining individuals in vocational and management fields; (iii) the creation and administration of a \n                                                 \n9  In Mal\u00e9, there are 27 software application training providers. Outside Mal\u00e9, there are 29 computer training \nproviders. Ten private providers focus on language and other training services. \n ", "4    \nframework  for  resolving  conflicts  between  employers  and  employees  and  protecting  their \nrespective rights; and (iv) the issuance of permits for expatriates to work in the Maldives and \nenforcement of regulations on terms and conditions of employment.10  The  Maldives\u2019  labor \nlegislation  is  embodied  in  the  Employment  Regulation  1994.  Employment  contracts  are \nmandatory for locally engaged workers and expatriate employees. There is no minimum wage \nnor a wage structure. The salaries and benefits and other working conditions, including working \nhours, are determined by negotiations between employer and employee, without any minimum \nstandards  set  and  monitored  by  the  Government.  The  Maldives  is  not  a  member  of  the \nInternational Labour Organization (ILO), but not being a member does not prevent the country \nfrom  adopting  ILO  conventions  and  recommendations.  Better  articulated  and  more \ncomprehensive labor legislation, the draft Employment Act, prepared with technical assistance \nfrom the ILO, was submitted by MHREL to the Law Commission and now needs to be submitted \nto the Cabinet for their recommendation to submit it to Parliament. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n13.  National  economic  development  requires  the  efficient  employment  of  all  available \nresources, including human resources. The Maldives\u2019 failure to adequately utilize its human \nresources potential is a key constraint to development. Increasing the employment of Maldivians \nwould promote more equitable sharing of the benefits of economic development, and is a \nsustainable  approach  to  poverty  reduction.  While  the  Maldives\u2019  economy  grew  at  annual \naverage of about 8%11 between 1995 and 2000,12 the labor force expanded by only 5%. During \nthe same period, expatriate labor grew at an annual average of 8%. The Maldives is highly \ndependent on skilled expatriate labor. Employers, including the Government, hire expatriate \nworkers  in  the  absence  of  properly  trained  and  qualified  Maldivians.  This  is  against  the \nbackdrop of untapped human resources, which include a large number of youths who are \noutside the labor force. An increasing number of youths have completed primary education but \ncould not continue on to further education. These young men and women are capable but have \nlimited access to skills training programs. In 2000, there were 25,461 youths aged 15 to 19 \n(77% of the cohort) who were not in the labor force. To make better use of its human resources \npotential, the Maldives must (i) make the prospective Maldivian employee more attractive to the \nemployer, and (ii) make training and employment more attractive to the Maldivian employee.    \n   \n14.  Prospective employees will be more attractive to employers if they are better trained and \nqualified in needed occupational areas. For training to be more attractive to Maldivian youths, \naccess to high-quality skills training programs must be increased, the training programs offered \nmust offer a high likelihood of employment, and the training offered should be in occupations \nattractive to the trainee. Employment will be more attractive when work conditions, including \nwork hours, leave, and accommodation, are appropriate. Employment regulations have to be \neffectively monitored to ensure that employees\u2019 and employers\u2019 rights are not transgressed. The \nkey issues thus relate to the availability of skills training opportunities, demand for skills training, \nquality and relevance of skills training, and the work environment.   \n \n15.  Access to Skills Training. While access to and quality of academic education continue \nto improve, more attention has to be focused on the needs of the large number of youths for \nwhom  further  academic  education  will  not  be  possible.  Students  who  leave  school  after \ncompleting grade 7 or who discontinue secondary studies without passing O-levels face limited \nnonacademic or employment skills training opportunities. Current requests by atoll chiefs cannot \n                                                 \n10 Ministry of Human Resources and Labour. 1998. \n  Available: http://www.humanresources.gov.mv/MHREL/Ministry/Ministry.asp. \n11 Between 1995 and 2002, the average annual growth rate was 7%. \n12 Where labor force data comparisons are made, the reference date is 2000. \n   \n ", "    5 \nall be presently met; most of the trainees in short-term courses are enrolled in Mal\u00e9. The range of \nskills training also needs to be expanded to offer more opportunities to women and island-\nresidents. Scheduling of training should be flexible, and programs should be regularly offered in \nvarious regions, atolls, and islands.  \n \n16.  Demand for Skills Training and Employment. An increased birthrate in the late 1980s \nand early 1990s resulted in a population increase of youths now in their mid- to late teens. This \ncohort of 15- to 19-year-old youths has completed primary school, is progressing through \nsecondary school, and will soon be seeking access to further education or employment.  By \n2006, the number of Maldivian youths of this age will be about 41,100. This is double the \nnumber of youths in the same age cohort 10 years ago.  In 2001 and 2002, 10,304 students \nwere unable to continue from grade 7 to 8, and 8,124 students from grade 10 to 11.  \n \n17.  Attitudes  toward  employment  are  starting  to  change.  Students  and  parents  are \nincreasingly seeking training and employment opportunities for youths no longer in school. \nApplications for advertised positions are increasing. Atoll chiefs are requesting skills training. \nAmong community leaders and parents, there is growing awareness and concern to find a \nsolution to youth unemployment. Enforced youth idleness may at times be linked to social ills \nsuch as drug abuse and involvement in nonproductive activities. Prevailing social attitudes and \nparental concern for the welfare of girls hinder female participation in employment away from \ntheir home island. However, attitudes relating to the employment of women in resorts appear to \nbe changing; more women are being employed, mainly in clerical positions. Attitudes and the \nexpectations of many students and parents are that higher education will lead to white-collar \njobs,  especially  in  government.  A  reorientation  of  attitudes  to  nongovernment  jobs  and \nalternative  employment  opportunities  is  required.  During  focus  group  discussions,  youths \nindicated that they are interested in various occupations and employment. \n \n18.  Ensuring the Quality and Relevance of Skills Training. Skills training must address \nthe needs of the labor market and should also be acceptable to students and their parents. \nSkills training augments the knowledge and competencies acquired through formal education. \nDuring  project  preparation,  some  employers  expressed  the  view  that  secondary  and \npostsecondary  student-graduates  are  not  properly  trained  for  positions  they  accept  after \ngraduation.  There  is  a  need  to  increase  entry-level  employment  skills  through  short-term \ncourses. Skills training courses should be reviewed and revised to ensure relevance to various \nindustries\u2019  needs  and  actual  occupational  requirements.  Competency-based skills training \n(CBST) programs developed and implemented in coordination with employers and relevant \noccupational employees will ensure that appropriate skills are acquired by trainees. These are \nalso  designed  to  focus  on  the  outcome  of  the  training  with  reference  to  observable  and \nmeasurable evidence. While the establishment of MAB and the introduction of the Maldives \nNational Qualifications Framework provide the initial structure for the accreditation of education \nprograms,  a  corresponding  mechanism  for  vocational  qualification  and  occupational \nperformance standards should be developed.  \n \n19.  Work Environment. For the limited issues where the present regulations provide for the \nsafeguard  of  employees  and  employers,  interviews  conducted  during  project  preparation \nindicated that more effective monitoring is needed. There is indeed a need for a systematic \napproach for monitoring the implementation of labor legislation. Information to monitor and \nanalyze the labor market, guide the development of HRD and labor policies, and monitor labor \nregulations is lacking. To date, MHREL\u2019s major activities relate to awarding and monitoring \nscholarships, issuing work permits, monitoring the expatriate quota system, and administering \nfee collection. Labor regulations and standards have to be updated and effectively implemented \nto encourage employers to employ Maldivians and to encourage Maldivians to seek and stay in \n ", "6    \nemployment.  Conditions  for  employment  need  to  be  better  aligned  to  social,  family,  and \ngeographic constraints. Some of the salaries offered are too low and the working conditions, \nincluding the hours and days, are onerous. In cases where employees have to live on the work \npremises,  accommodation  standards,  especially  for  females,  are  sometimes  inappropriate. \nThere is a dearth of data and analysis to inform labor market policies. MHREL will start \ncollecting labor force survey type data in 2004. MHREL\u2019s capacity to perform more effective \nlabor administration, labor market analysis, and labor policy formulation to help employees and \nemployers alike needs strengthening.  \n \n20.  Government  Strategy  and  Policy.  The  proposed  Project  is  consistent  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s medium-term objectives and priorities defined in the Sixth National Development \nPlan (6th  NDP)  and  Vision  2020.  The  key  social  priorities  of  the  6th NDP include poverty \nreduction, promoting gender equity, decreased regional disparities, and increasing opportunities \nfor youths. The broad national development objective upon which the 6th NDP is based includes \nthe need to \u201cincrease human resource capacity and productivity by providing relevant training \nand employment opportunities.\u201d13 The urgency to address the needs of youths was underscored \nby the President\u2019s speech on November 2002 and July 2003 when he called for a national effort \nto widen employment opportunities in the country as the number of youths entering the job \nmarket was rising sharply.   \n \n21.  ADB Strategy. ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program (CSP) for 2002\u2013200414 for the \nMaldives focuses on poverty reduction through a combination of pro-poor growth, HRD, and \ngood governance initiatives. The possibility of graduation from \u201cleast-developed country\u201d status \nis also taken into account. The strategy extends out to the islands where Maldives\u2019 vulnerable \ngroups live and where women\u2019s employment opportunities are limited. In education, ADB\u2019s \nfocus includes extending schooling opportunities to residents of the atolls and to women by \ndeveloping distance learning in postsecondary education and by developing skills through \nvocational training. The ongoing Postsecondary Education Development Project (PEDP)15 is \nsupporting MCHE to improve the quality and accessibility of postsecondary education, including \ndelivering education by distance mode. The focus is on upgrading the faculty and staff of MCHE \nfor the provision of good quality higher education to those who have completed secondary \neducation. The proposed Project  will focus on employment-oriented skills training for those \nunable to go on to further education, and will provide some assistance to the development and \ndelivery of short-term training at MCHE. The ongoing ADB Regional Development Project16 will \nprovide opportunities for increased employment in the Northern and Southern Development \nregions. The Regional Development Project does not include HRD as a major component as it \nis predominantly an infrastructure-development initiative. \n \n22.  Lessons  Learned.  In  the  consultations  and  site  visits  during  project  preparation, \nconcerns were raised by various groups over the dangers of designing and implementing \neducation and training deemed by the community and employers as inferior in quality and \nlacking relevance to local needs. To avoid a mismatch of education and training with the needs \nof the community, mechanisms must be established to encourage participatory planning input \nfrom  employers,  employees,  community  representatives,  and  the  Government.  A  project \n                                                 \n13 President's Office Republic of Maldives.

Governments should play a facilitating role in skills training and \nprovide financing when it is for the economically and socially disadvantaged, or in occupations \nnot offered by the private sector.18 Experience with offering vocational education in general \neducation shows that students do not gain any advantage in the labor market. It is also costly \nand gender-biased.19 \n \n23.  ADB  experience  in  the  Maldives  indicates  that  most  line  ministries  have  limited \nimplementation capacity due to scarcity of skilled and experienced staff. Delays in project \nimplementation occur primarily in the initial phases of appointing consultants and awarding \ncontracts. To address this matter, it is essential to strengthen implementation capacity and \ncoordination  and  provide  long-term training for project staff in the relevant institutions and \nagencies.20 \n \n24.  Donor Coordination. Education sector projects currently under way in the Maldives \ninclude the World Bank\u2019s Third Education and Training Project, which provides foreign study \nscholarships generally at the Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s level. The project also provides for in-\nservice primary school teacher training, and civil works to increase secondary school enrollment \nparticularly secondary school infrastructure, particularly in the atolls where population density \njustifies the construction of a secondary school. The World Bank and the Government are also \npreparing an integrated multisector human development project that would include job-matching \nservices and microfinance, components that complement the activities of this ADB-assisted \nProject. During implementation, coordination of activities where applicable will be undertaken. \nOther relevant ongoing external assistance to education and HRD is listed in Appendix 3. \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n25.  The goal of the Project is to increase the number of Maldivians, men and women, \nactively  participating  in  the  labor  force  and  employed.  The  Project  will  provide  more \nemployment-oriented skills training in various occupations and improve the capacity to develop \nand  deliver  CBST.  The  Project  aims  to  (i) provide  youths  with  employment-oriented skills \ntraining; (ii) improve public perception of training and employment in locally available skills-\noriented occupations; (iii) make available employment-related information to more Maldivians; \nand (iv) strengthen the capacity for labor administration and for labor market analysis. These will \nbe achieved by (i) increasing access to quality employment-oriented skills training in selected \nregions, (ii) social marketing and improving career guidance and awareness of employment \nopportunities, and (iii) strengthening the capacity of MHREL.  \n \n26.  Training in the Project will be delivered in three geographic regions: the island of Mal\u00e9 \nand  adjacent  atolls,  the  Northern  Development  Region,  and  the  Southern  Development \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2002.

Manila \n ", "8    \nRegion,21  where  regional  development  activities  are  ongoing.  The  Project  will  focus  on \ndelivering training in four key sectors: tourism, fisheries and agriculture, transport, and the social \nsectors. These are included in the national development priority and play an important part in \nthe continued economic well-being of the country. Tourism is a major employment sector and an \nimportant  source  of  foreign  exchange  revenue.  The  fisheries  sector  is  a  mainstay  of  the \neconomy,  particularly  for  people  living  in  the  atolls  and  islands,  and  the  development  of \nagriculture is important to national food security. Transportation is an extremely important and \ngrowing sector supporting both tourism and the fisheries. The social sector, consisting primarily \nof education and health, is critical to the well-being of the population and is currently heavily \nreliant on expatriate employment. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n1.  Training Design, Development, and Delivery  \n27.  This component aims to increase the provision of CBST, with a particular focus on \npreparing out-of-school youth for entry-level employment. To ensure that training programs are \nrelevant  to  employer  needs  and  to  impart  appropriate  skills  to  acceptable  performance \nstandards,  the  Project  will  be  (i) working  with  employment  sector  councils  (ESCs), \n(ii) strengthening  the  capacity  to  deliver  CBST,  and  (iii) delivering  coordinated  training \nprograms. The techniques to be used will be based on the principles and practices of learner-\nfocused adult education.  \n \na.  Identifying Human Resources Development Needs through \nEmployment Sector Councils \n28.  The effectiveness and efficiency of workforce development in the Maldives require \nmechanisms to create working partnerships between employers and providers of employment-\noriented education and training. For a coordinated approach to identifying human resource \nneeds and monitoring the effectiveness of training, ESCs will be established in the four focus \nsectors. Appendix 4 provides details on ESC operations. ESCs will prepare a human resource \nneeds assessment and strategy for the short- and medium-term employment needs of their \nsectors, and contribute to developing strategies to employ more Maldivians. ESCs will prioritize \nthe occupations in which there is demand for workers, and, with the support of the HRD training \nspecialists, prepare skills training proposals for project funding to help meet these occupational \nrequirements. ESCs will provide input to setting skills standards for assessment and certification \nthat will guide the development of training programs. ESCs will provide feedback on training \nquality and relevance of training provided. ESCs will liaise with the  Maldives Network for \nEmployment Training (MNET) to place trainees in jobs. The Project will provide support to \nworkshops,  consultations,  and  consulting  services  to  assist  in  the  preparation  of  human \nresource needs assessments and skills training program proposals in the respective sectors. \n \nb.  Strengthening Capacity to Develop Competency-Based Skills \nTraining Programs \n29.  This subcomponent will augment local capacity to design and develop training programs \nand  related  instructional  materials.  It  will  support  the  development  of  CBST  programs  by \nproviding workshops and training for instructional program designers, developers, and trainers. \n \n                                                 \n21 This  consists  of  North  Thiladhunmathee  Atoll  (Haa  Alifu),  South  Thiladhunmathee  Atoll  (Haa  Dhaalu), \nNorthMiladhunmadulu Atoll (Shaviyani), Mal\u00e9 Atolls, North Huvadhoo Atoll (Gaafu Alifu), South Huvadhoo Atoll, \n(Gaafu Dhaalu), Foamullah Atoll (Gnaviyani), and Addu Atoll (Seenu). \n   \n ", "    9 \n30.  The capacity of MAB to review and articulate the implementation of a national vocational \nqualifications policy and framework will be strengthened; where necessary, modifications of the \nframework  will  be  recommended.  The  Project  will  provide  consulting  services  and  staff \ndevelopment activities. The staff development will be for two MAB staff to further their education \nby undergoing studies and preparing projects supporting the articulation of skills qualifications \nframework within the context of Maldives.  \n \n31.  The Project will support the development of competency-based skills standards. For the \nESC-prioritized occupations, skills standards will be developed through the coordinated efforts \nof the relevant representatives/staff of ESCs (mainly practitioners); MCHE; MAB; Ministry of \nFisheries, Agriculture and Marine Resources; and the HRD training specialist. Relevant staff of \nMCHE, MAB and MHREL will undergo work-training workshops to enhance their capacity to \nundertake occupational task analyses in vocational and technical areas. Skills standards will be \ndeveloped and adopted for a minimum of 40 occupations.  \n \n32.  Related CBST programs will be developed. Training program development will draw on \nthe expertise of MCHE, other public and private training and education providers, professional \ngroups, and practitioners. The Project will conduct workshops in training program design and \ndevelopment.  Where  existing  training  programs  are  available,  these  will  be  reviewed  and \nrevised as necessary, according to the skills standards and the needs of the requesting ESC. \nRepresentatives from private training providers will be invited to participate in design and \ndevelopment workshops. The Project will develop a system to monitor and evaluate the quality \nand relevance of training programs.  \n \nc.  Delivering Skills Training Programs  \n \n33.  Increasing  Access.  The Project will increase access to skills training programs  by \nproviding for training delivery recurrent costs, which include instructor fees, consumables, and \nlearner materials. Appendix 5 presents the indicative operational manual for funding training. \nThe skills training programs to be supported will be selected from those proposed by ESCs and \napproved  by  the  project  steering  committee  (PSC).  Course  fees  will  be  collected,  as \nappropriate. Criteria relating to the setting of course fees will be recommended and adopted by \nthe PSC. In addition, communities will be able to propose and obtain support for skills training \nwithin the four sectors. Overall, women will constitute at least 40% of all the trainees in the \nProject. Training will be designed, developed, and delivered by public and private training \nproviders, including MCHE. \n \n34.  The Project will support: (i) training for potential new entrants in occupations of priority \nneed as identified by ESCs; (ii) training for occupations currently occupied by expatriates who \nmay eventually be replaced by Maldivian employees as agreed by ESCs and further described \nin each sector\u2019s strategic human resources plan; (iii) training of individuals engaged in the \ninformal sector to enhance income generation opportunities; and (iv) training for occupations of \nfuture need as identified by national economic priorities. The Project will consider funding \n(i) training undertaken on the job to enhance the efficiency of existing workers within a particular \noccupational category, and (ii) training of existing employees off the job to develop new skills \ndirectly linked to employment. \n \n35.  Maldives  Network  for  Employment  Training.  MNET  will  be  established  as  a \nsecretariat to facilitate the logistics and work associated with the design, development, and \ndelivery of training programs. The Project will establish an MNET office in Mal\u00e9 and one each in \nthe  Northern  and  Southern  Development  regions.  MNET  will  identify,  broker,  and  access \nresources for the design, development, marketing, and delivery of quality employment-oriented \n ", "10    \neducation and training. MNET and the project implementation unit (PIU) will maintain databases \nof  skills  standards,  training  package  information,  providers,  students,  and  student  tracer \ninformation. MNET and the PIU  will be supported through consulting services, materials, and \noffice equipment. MNET\u2019s functions will continue beyond the project implementation period. \n \n36.  Policy Dialogue for a Sustainable Fund for Training. The Project will conduct a policy \ndialogue with stakeholders to set up a sustainable mechanism to fund skills training for adoption \nduring  project  implementation.  The  Project  will  provide  consulting  services  to  analyze \nalternatives for sustainable financing, and recommend an appropriate mechanism. Details will \nbe developed on the establishment, set-up, and administration of the sustainable mechanism, \nincluding its organization, operating procedures, criteria for evaluating proposals for funding, \nand the contracting scheme. \n \n2.  Career Guidance, Employment Information, and Social Marketing \n37.  This component aims to (i) positively impact public attitudes and perceptions of the \nconditions and benefits of employment, particularly in the private sector; (ii) increase awareness \nof employment opportunities; and (iii) provide career guidance.  \n \n38.  Secondary  Schools.  Secondary  school  students  will  be  provided  with  career \ninformation. MYS will develop a career guidance program to more effectively inform youth and \nprovide occupational choice in the world of work. This program will be offered in cooperation \nwith MOE in the secondary schools located in the Project\u2019s regions. This subcomponent will \ninclude training 90 teachers as focal points for career guidance, developing and disseminating \ncareer  information  materials,  providing  career  guidance  corners  in  secondary  schools, \nundertaking career-related school and community youth activities, and visits to work places and \nvisits by career role models. The development of learning materials and teachers\u2019 materials will \nreceive inputs from ESCs, MHREL, and MOE. One MYS and one MOE staff member will \nreceive support for further education in career guidance. Eight staff from MYS, MOE, MHREL, \nand  MCHE  will  receive  international  training  in  career  guidance.  Consulting  services  and \nrelevant materials will be provided by the Project. MYS will be provided with assistance to \ndevelop youth-oriented career guidance materials. \n \n39.  Maldives College of Higher Education. The capacity of MCHE to give career advice to \nstudents will be developed. Two MCHE staff members in Mal\u00e9 and two from the regional \ncampuses will be given local training in career guidance. The Project will support the furnishing \nof a student career service center in the Mal\u00e9 campus of MCHE. These will facilitate the flow of \ninformation to students on available employment and provide students with services to guide \nthem through the process of deciding on a career, and searching and applying for a job.  \n \n40.  Communities. The Project will establish \u201cemployment information kiosks\u201d in 20 islands \nin the project regions and in two locations in Mal\u00e9 to disseminate information on employment \nopportunities. These will be under the supervision of MHREL, Employment Section. The islands \nwill be chosen on the basis of population and economic activity, in consultation with the Ministry \nof Planning and National Development and Ministry of Atolls Administration. Activities will be in \ncooperation with the officials of the atoll offices, island offices, MYS, and the MCHE campus. An \nisland resident will be chosen and trained to assist in employment information dissemination. \nMNET sites will be provided with necessary office equipment; kiosks will be provided with notice \nboards and communications equipment. Employment information will be from MHREL and \nemployers.  \n \n   \n ", "    11 \n41.  Social Marketing. Social marketing will seek to inform the public at large about the wide \nrange of occupations available in different economic sectors, and the merits of training and \neducation with a view to changing attitudes toward employment. Public information campaigns \non television, radio, and in print will be prepared and disseminated under the guidance of \nMHREL, Employment Department, and in cooperation with MYS. The programs will include \nstories of successful Maldivian men and women in the four sectors\u2014tourism, fisheries and \nagriculture, transport, and the social sectors\u2014as well as information on labor legislation. The \nprograms will also address the employment of women. A study on youth attitudes toward work \nwill be supported.     \n \n3.  Capacity Strengthening of the Ministry of Human Resources, Employment \nand Labor  \n42.  This component aims to strengthen the capacity of MHREL to undertake its role as the \nministry responsible for labor administration, emphasizing a suitable balance between its role in \nlabor protection and equity, on the one hand, and national development and growth, on the \nother, and consistent with the limited resources available. A comprehensive labor administration \npolicy, together with an organizational review of MHREL, will be undertaken with a view to \nidentify areas where adjustments are needed for greater effectiveness and for implementation of \nlabor policies and regulations, including through staff development and realignment of units and \nresponsibilities  within  MHREL.  The  labor  administration  policy  will  be  developed  in  close \nconsultation and cooperation between the labor administration consultant and MHREL staff, \nthus serving as an on-the-job training element for MHREL staff. Other stakeholders, in particular \nworkers and employers, will also be consulted. The close cooperation between the consultant \nand  MHREL  staff  will  provide  MHREL  staff  with  a  better  understanding  of  the  structure, \norganization, and operations required for labor administration. Training and skills development \nnecessary for the effective delivery of labor administration services will also be provided.  \n \n43.  The existing Employment Regulations, the draft Employment Act, and labor policies will \nbe examined to identify ways in which their compliance can be better monitored, including \nthrough a system of self-monitoring and self-inspection as well as through the drafting of \nimplementable and monitorable supporting regulations where necessary. \n \n44.  The development of the labor market information system (LMIS) will be supported by \nstrengthening  the  capacity  of  relevant  MHREL  staff  to  collect  and  analyze  labor  market \ninformation for policy analysis and labor market signaling. Policy studies will be conducted in the \nfollowing areas: (i) the impact of expatriate workers and localization of labor on the economy; \n(ii) attitudes toward employment in the atolls; (iii) gender aspects of employment in selected \nsectors; and (iv) wage structures and working conditions. The Project will provide materials and \nequipment, consulting services, and staff development. \n \nC.   Special Features \n \n45.  Private Sector Participation. Extensive consultations were held during the preparation \nof the Project, including with the private sector. In addition to consultations, the private sector \nwas a member of the project preparation steering committee. During project implementation, \nemployers, as well as employees, will be members of ESCs. The project design is based on the \nactive participation of employers to ensure market orientation, relevance, and quality of skills \ntraining programs. Private sector employers will also be represented in the PSC.  \n \n46.  Policy.  The  Project  supports  the  development  and  articulation  of  a  vocational \nqualification framework and occupational performance standards to assure the quality and \n ", "12    \nrelevance of skills training programs. The Project also supports the development of a policy for \nsustainable financing of skills training that would be less dependent on the recurrent budget and \npublic provision. This will contribute to maintaining skills training responsiveness to changing \neconomic development and labor market needs.  \n \nD.   Cost Estimates \n47.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $7.5 million equivalent, including physical \ncontingency and price escalation, taxes and duties, and interest charges. Of the total cost, \n$2.1 million (28%) comprises the foreign exchange cost, and $5.4 million equivalent (72%) \ncomprises  the  local  currency  cost.  The  indicative  project  cost  by  expense  category  is \nsummarized in Table 1.

Financing Plan  \n48.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of SDR 4,196,000 ($6.0 million) equivalent from \nits Special Funds resources (ADF). The Borrower will be the Republic of the Maldives. The loan \nwill have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1% \nper year during the grace period and 1.5% per year during the remaining term and such other \nterms and conditions as set forth in the Loan Agreement. ADB will finance 80% of the project \ncost, including 100% of the foreign exchange cost and 72% of the local currency cost. The \nGovernment  will  finance  the  remaining  $1.5 million  equivalent  of  local  costs.  Table  2 \nsummarizes the proposed financing arrangements and the details are in Appendix 6. \n \n \n   \n ", "    13 \nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local   Total    \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost  % \n         \nAsian Development Bank  2.1  3.9  6.0  80 \nGovernment   0.0  1.5  1.5  20 \n         \n               Total  2.1  5.4  7.5  100 \n               %  28  72  100   \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n \n49.  The financing of the local currency cost by ADB is justified under ADB\u2019s local financing \npolicy.22  The  Project  will  meet  the  skills  development  needs  of  the  country  and  address \nconcerns related to employment, gender, and regional inequality. \n      \nF.  Implementation Arrangements  \n1.   Project Management \n50.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury  (MOFT)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency (EA), \nresponsible for the overall coordination of the Project. The implementing agency will be MHREL. \nA PSC will be established to facilitate policy dialogue, advise the project manager (PM) of \nconcerns and issues related to all aspects of project implementation, and facilitate coordination \nbetween ministries and agencies. A PIU will be established. The PIU will be responsible for the \ntimely implementation of all project components and for procurement packages. Working groups \nwill  be  organized  to  coordinate  and  guide  the  implementation  of  project  components  and \nactivities. See Appendix 7 for the Project's organization chart. \n \n51.  The PM will function under the authority delegated by MHREL. The PM will serve as the \nsecretary to the PSC and as such ensure the proper operation of the Project. Policy issues \nrelated to overall implementation of the Project will be brought to the attention of the PSC. The \nPM will be guided by the policy decisions approved by the PSC. For administrative purposes, \nthe  PM  will  report  to  the  assistant  executive  director,  MHREL.  The  PSC  will  consist  of \nrepresentatives from ministries and MCHE, and two representatives from the private sector, and \nthe project director. The ministries are MHREL (chairperson), MOFT, Ministry of Planning and \nNational  Development,  Ministry  of  Atolls  Administration,  MOE,  MYS,  and  the  Ministry  of \nWomen\u2019s Affairs and Social Security. The composition of the PSC is subject to approval by the \nOffice of the President. Other ministries may be invited to PSC meetings as necessary. \n2.   Implementation Period \n52.  The Project will be implemented over a period of 5 years beginning in April 2004 and \nending in March 2009.  The overall project implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 8. \n \n3.   Procurement \n53.  The  procurement  of  goods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  undertaken  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  the  Government\u2019s  procedures \n                                                 \n22 ADB Operations Manual Section 11. 1995. Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Expenditures on Projects. Manila. \n ", "14    \nacceptable to ADB. Civil works consist mainly of refurbishing existing facilities. No contract for \ncivil works is estimated to cost more than $1.0 million equivalent. International competitive \nbidding procedures will, therefore, not be necessary. Contracts costing up to a maximum of \n$1.0 million will be awarded under local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to \nADB. Equipment for the PIU, ESCs, MNET access sites, and employment kiosks will be \nprocured by LCB procedures acceptable to ADB. Office furniture for the PIU, ESCs, access \nsites, and the employment sites will also be procured by LCB acceptable to ADB. Instructional \nmaterials will be procured by international shopping while the production of television and radio \nprograms to support the social marketing component will be procured by LCB acceptable to \nADB. For off-the-shelf items valued at less than $100,000, direct purchase procedures can be \nused. Appendix 9 shows the tentative procurement packages.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n54.  The selection and engagement of all consulting services to be financed under the \nProject will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. A team of \nconsultants to provide services in a range of specialties with estimated international inputs of 28 \nperson-months and domestic inputs of 50 person-months will be engaged through a firm using \nthe quality and cost-based selection method. Another 4 person-months of international inputs \nfor services in labor administration will be provided by an individual consultant. In case the \nexpertise for domestic inputs is not locally available, international consultants will be used. \nAppendix 10 gives the indicative terms of reference.  \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n55.  MHREL  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections  and  requesting \nbudgetary allocations for counterpart funds. After the loan becomes effective, the Government \nwill establish an imprest account at the Maldives Monetary Authority. The initial amount will be \nno more than a 6-month projected disbursement or 10% of the loan amount. The imprest \naccount will be established, managed, and liquidated in accordance both with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook and with detailed arrangements agreed to by the Government and \nADB. The ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedures may be used to reimburse eligible \nexpenditures and to liquidate advances made into the imprest account in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  loan  disbursement  guidelines.  These  procedures  will  be  applicable  to  individual \npayments amounting to $50,000 or less. MHREL will coordinate the timely release of funds. \nAuditors  acceptable  to  ADB  will  audit  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of \nexpenditure procedures. A separate audit opinion should be included in the annual audit report.  \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n56.  MHREL, through its PIU, will maintain records and accounts adequate to identify goods \nand  services  financed  out  of  the  proceeds  of  the  loan.  MHREL  will  (i) maintain  separate \naccounts for the Project; (ii) ensure that accounts and financial statements are audited annually, \nin accordance with sound accounting principles by auditors acceptable to ADB; and (iii) furnish \nto ADB, not later than 9 months after the close of each fiscal year, certified copies of audited \naccounts and financial statements, and the report of the auditor on these. \n \n57.  MHREL will submit progress reports every 3 months. The reports will be in a format \nacceptable to ADB, and will include (i) progress made against established targets, including \naspects of quality; (ii) delays and problems encountered, and actions taken to resolve issues; \n(iii) compliance with loan covenants; (iv) proposed program of activities to be undertaken during \n   \n ", "    15 \nthe next 3 months; and (v) expected progress during the succeeding period. Within 3 months of \nphysical completion of the Project, the Government will prepare and submit to ADB a project \ncompletion report on the execution of the Project, including the costs and compliance with loan \ncovenants. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n58.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Project Performance Management System (PPMS), a shortlist \nof verifiable indicators for monitoring and evaluation was prepared. This list will be expanded \nand refined during project inception. PPMS activities will be conducted periodically to gather \ninformation  through  multiple  sources  so  as  to  determine  whether  the  input  deliveries  for \nimplementing program activities have rendered expected benefits to the intended beneficiaries. \nThe PPMS also seeks to detect any deficiency and discrepancy between the plan and the \nexecution of a program using resources efficiently so that timely corrections can be made to \nupdate the Project and thus improve the benefits, outcomes, and impacts. The PPMS will use \ninformation from the annual and semiannual reviews, midterm review (MTR), periodic evaluation \nand studies, and employer and trainee feedback. PIU human resources specialists will be \ntrained in project monitoring and evaluation. Baseline labor data will be from the planned 2004 \nLabor Force Survey and/or the 2005 Census; otherwise, the source will be the 2000 Census. \nSee Appendix 11 for indicative and evaluation indicators. \n \n8.  Project Review \n59.  In addition to regular reviews, the Government and ADB will jointly undertake an MTR of \nthe Project at the  end of the third year of project implementation or at any time as may be \nagreed  by  the  parties.  The  MTR  will  review  and  evaluate:  (i) the  project  scope,  design, \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  institutional  processes;  (ii)  review  the  training  funding \nmechanism; (iii) implementation progress against indicators based on the project framework; \n(iv) procurement performance; (v) ESC activities and coordination; (vi) vocational framework \nand its implementation by MAB; (vii) PIU's and working group's effectiveness; (viii) performance \nagainst the gender strategy; and (ix) compliance with loan covenants. The MTR will identify \ncritical issues and constraints, if any, and identify changes needed in any of the above areas. At \nthe latest 1 month prior to the MTR, the PIU will submit to ADB a comprehensive report on each \nof  the  above-mentioned  issues.  The  MTR  will  recommend  changes  in  the  design  and \nimplementation of the Project as necessary.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n60.  The main project benefits are: (i) more skilled Maldivians in the labor force and sharing \nin the benefits of economic development; (ii) increased capacity to design, develop, and deliver \ndemand-oriented  skills  training;  and  (iii) improved  labor  administration  and  labor market \nanalysis. Benefits to society at large will accrue through human development that is necessary \nfor  the  country\u2019s  development.  The  availability  of  skilled  labor  contributes  to  meeting  the \nmacroeconomic goals of the country, notably addressing the balance of payments, retention of \nforeign exchange, and availability of semi-skilled human resources. The direct beneficiaries of \nthe Project will be: (i) unemployed youths, including women; (ii) island communities; (iii) various \nministries addressing the issues of youths, HRD, and training; and (iv) public and private \ntraining providers.  \n \n ", "16    \n  A.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n61.  Economic Benefits. With about half of Maldivians not in the labor force, the economic \ngrowth of the Maldives has been aided by the employment of expatriate workers. The Project \nwill generate increases in labor productivity that will increase the competitiveness of Maldivians \nin the labor market. Coupled with MHREL\u2019s increased capacity to monitor and implement labor \nregulations and perform labor market analysis, the above activities will lead to the employment \nof more Maldivians in current and future positions that may be presently and/or expected to be \nheld by expatriates. In addition, employment of more Maldivians will contribute to the retention \nof more foreign exchange. \n \n62.  Through the Project\u2019s various components, the matching of labor supply with labor \ndemand  will  improve.  The  involvement  of  the  private  sector,  the  Government, and skills \npractitioners in determining the human resource needs in the selected sectors and in developing \nneeded training programs will yield good quality labor market information and more appropriate \ntraining programs. MHREL\u2019s increased capacity to analyze labor market data will enable it to \ngive timely guidance on the changing needs of the labor market. MNET\u2019s establishment will \ncontribute  to  facilitating  and  coordinating  the  different  stakeholders  and  requirements  for \ntraining. The wider dissemination of information on employment opportunities will reduce the \nsearch time for both employees and employers. \n \n63.  About 6,000 youths will receive employment-oriented skills training through the Project \nthat meets employers\u2019 requirements. Where half of the trainees would find employment for at \nleast 5 years and earn on average Rf2,000 per month, the project investment would be justified, \nwith an indicative economic rate of return of 33%. See Appendix 12 for the economic  and \nfinancial  analysis.  Without  the  project,  the  Maldives  will  continue  to  repatriate  increasing \namounts of foreign exchange for the increasing number of expatriate workers it needs for further \neconomic development, representing forgone income that could be shared by local Maldivians \nand used for further development activities. \n \n64.  Institutional Benefits. ESCs and partnerships will encourage policy dialogue among \nthe different employment stakeholders that would lead to greater coordination of activities, \nthereby increasing the efficiency in the investment on skills training. The establishment of MNET \nwill facilitate the coordination of training requirements and training provision. Increasing the \ndomestic capacity at MCHE and MOE to design skills training programs and develop related \ninstructional materials will contribute to: (i) increasing the range of skills training programs that \ncan be developed; (ii) decreasing the development time of programs and related materials; and \n(iii) increasing program quality. Private training providers\u2019 capacity in these areas will also be \nstrengthened when they participate in project workshops. Articulation of the skills training \ncompetency  framework  and  skills  standards  will  provide  the  framework  for  designing  and \naccrediting training programs offered by various training providers, including the participation of \nthe private sector. MHREL\u2019s capacity for effective labor administration will be enhanced such \nthat compliance with labor regulations will be better monitored and labor-market analysis is \nstrengthened.  \n \n65.  Social Dimensions. Participatory consultations were held during the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA) with the representatives of the communities, youths, women, \ngovernment, and private sector to identify needs and discuss the role of skills training in various \nsectors. The PPTA incorporated the findings of ADB\u2019s Poverty Reduction in the Maldives and \n   \n ", "    17 \nWomen in the Republic of Maldives.23, 24 See Appendix 13 for the summary and poverty \nreduction and social strategy. \n \n66.  The Project will address primarily the training and unemployment problems of youths. \nThe Project will benefit (i) youths aged 16\u201334; (ii) primary school completers with no further \neducation, (ii) secondary school completers, (iii) island communities with little access to training, \nand  (iv) job-seekers.  Through  the  development  of  modular  CBST  programs  that  can  be \ndelivered flexibly, the Project will train mostly out-of-school youths in market-relevant skills. \nTraining  will  be  offered  not  only  in  Mal\u00e9  but  also  in  the  islands,  where  there  is  greater \nvulnerability. Community initiatives will address the needs of the smaller islands, which have \nless access to training programs and formal employment. \n \n67.  Greater labor force participation among youths will be encouraged through positive \nmessages on employment. Gender disparity in the labor market is addressed through the career \nguidance  and  employment  services,  and  training  provision  components.  Through  social \nmarketing, more girls and women will be encouraged to participate in the labor market by \nmeans of positive images of employment opportunities. More training programs that are women-\nfriendly will be delivered. At least 40% of all trainees will be women.  \n \n68.  Job-seekers,  in  the  islands  and  in  Mal\u00e9,  will  be  better  informed  on  employment \nopportunities and will be given assistance in the job application process. More effective labor \nadministration will lead to welfare improvements of both employees and employers. Community \nresidents in the target regions will benefit through access to career guidance materials and \ninformation  delivered  through  MNET, atoll offices, schools, and other social sector service \nfacilities.  \n \nB.  Project Assumptions and Risks \n69.  The success of the Project in meeting its goal primarily assumes that the economy of the \nMaldives  continues  to  grow  and  create  and  new  jobs.  In  addition,  it  also  assumes  that: \n(i) employers are going to hire more skilled Maldivian workers; (ii) Maldivian youths will actively \nseek employment, including in occupations other than white-collar, and will seek training; and \n(iii) stakeholders will cooperate and coordinate with each other in a timely and constructive \nmanner. The proposed Project aims to mitigate the risks of these assumptions not holding true \nby: (i) identifying, developing, and delivering training that is oriented toward the needs of the \nlabor  market;  (ii) building  the  capacity  of  MHREL  for  more  effective  monitoring  and \nimplementation  of  labor  legislation  and  labor  market  analysis;  (iii) implementing  a  social \nmarketing  program  aimed  not  only  at  students  but  also at parents and communities and \ndelivering a modified career guidance program in secondary schools; (iv) having wide sectoral \nrepresentation on the PSC and in ESCs, as well coordination efforts through MNET and PIU; \nand (iv) actively encouraging dialogue  with and participation of the private sector in project \nimplementation.  \n \n70.  Implementation Risk. Project implementation assumes that skilled and experienced \nstaff are available for recruitment for project activities. The Appraisal Mission assessed the \navailability of personnel and received an assurance from MHREL that PIU would be properly \nstaffed. Previous delays in project implementation occurred in the initial phases due to delays in \nawarding  contracts  and  appointing  consultants.  PIU  staff  will  include  a  procurement  and \ndisbursement  specialist  to  oversee  these  activities.  Advance  action  in  the  recruitment  of \n                                                 \n23 ADB. 2001. Country Briefing Paper on Women in the Republic of Maldives. Manila. \n24 ADB. 2002. Poverty Reduction in the Maldives: Issues, Findings, and Approaches. Manila.    \n ", "18    \nconsultants  is  requested.  A  technical  adviser  will  also  be  recruited  to  provide  project \nmomentum. Effective project  implementation will require good coordination and cooperation \nbetween ministries and agencies. The PIU and working groups will facilitate coordination and \nimplementation of activities.  \n \n71.  Institutional Risk. Achieving better labor administration assumes that (i) MHREL staff \ntrained under the Project will not be transferred to other institutions, (ii) collection and analysis of \nlabor  market  data  will  be  timely,  and  (iii) MHREL  will  receive  the  appropriate  amount  of \nresources to carry out its mandate. Staff turnover in the Government is not high, which should \nmean that the Government will have the staff in place during the implementation period. MHREL \nis staffing its planning section with qualified personnel. The Government assured the Appraisal \nMission that the required resources for the functioning of MHREL would be met.   \n \n72.  The effectiveness of ESCs rests on commitment and cooperation among its members. \nCompanies and agencies are expected to support the ESC concept with the participation of \nrepresentatives/staff and attendance in meetings and related activities. The PPTA experience, \nwith the cooperation of PSC members, was positive and there is expectation that constructive \ndialogue  will  continue.  The  PIU,  as  ESC  secretariat,  will  facilitate  exchanges  and \ncommunication among ESC members.  \n     \n73.  Social Risk. Training programs developed are assumed to be relevant to local needs \nand of good quality. ESCs\u2019 articulation of human resource needs and MNET facilitation of the \ndelivery of training will contribute to ensuring training relevance. The Project will employ a \nparticipatory process involving private and public sector employers, employees, the community \nrepresentatives, and the Government.  \n \n74.  The social marketing component runs the risk of its targeted audience being unreceptive \nto  the  messages.  The  Project  will  employ  participatory  design  processes  and  adopt  a \nmultipronged  strategy  through  schools  and  various  media.  In  addition,  the  school  career \nguidance counselors selected will have a good understanding of Maldivian culture. \n \n75.  The Project will have no negative environmental impact. The Project includes no new \nconstruction and is unlikely to trigger ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy. Training programs \nwill be taking place in schools and/or employment places that have proper disposal facilities for \nmaterials used. Also, the Project is unlikely to bring into play the ADB Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples.  \n \nV.   ASSURANCES \n \n76.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has made a number of specific \nassurances for effective project implementation: \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that the four ESCs are established and its members \nnotified  of  their  membership  and  responsibilities  within  one  month  of  loan \neffectiveness; \n(ii)  ESCs will have representatives of employers and employees working in the \nrespective  sectors  as  well  as  regional  representation.  All  necessary  and \nappropriate measures will be taken to ensure that women are represented on \nESCs. Each ESC will have at least two women; \n   \n ", "    19 \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that sufficient budget allocations will be made to \ncover recurrent costs needed for effective project implementation, in particular in \nrelation to the daily operations of the PIU and MHREL; \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that the admission requirements to the various \ntraining  programs  will  take  into  account  the  occupational profiles developed \nunder the training design, development, and delivery component; \n(v)  Within 24 months of loan effectiveness, the government will have adopted a \npolicy on sustainable funding for training, including provision for cost recovery; \n(vi)  Project funds allocated for the development and delivery of training programs will \nbe distributed to each of the four sectors in a manner that reflects accurate \neconomic and social development needs. To that extent, each ESC will be \nrequested to submit proposals for at least three training programs a year. At least \ntwo proposals per ESC will be selected for funding, in accordance with selection \ncriteria agreed upon with the ADB; \n(vii)  At least 5% of project funds allocated for the development and delivery of training \nprograms will be allocated for training programs identified by communities every \nyear.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  ESCs  will  actively  seek  community \nparticipation in identifying and delivering these training programs; \n(viii)  The Government will take all necessary and appropriate measures to ensure that \nat least 40% of all trainees will be women and implement the gender strategy (as \ndetailed in Appendix 11, Section D of this document); \n(ix)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  candidates  selected  for  training  in  career \nguidance speak Dhivehi and have in-depth understanding of Maldivian culture; \n(x)  Within 1 year of loan effectiveness, the draft Employment Act will have been \nsubmitted to Parliament; and \n(xi)  The Government will ensure that sufficient airtime on national television will be \nallocated for dissemination campaigns under the career guidance, employment \ninformation, and social marketing component. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n77.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 4,196,000 to the Republic of the Maldives for the Employment Skills \nTraining Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1% \nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n \n \n5 November 2003 \n ", "20 Appendix 1 \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign   Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets  Mechanism  and Risks \n       \nGoal       \nIncrease the number of  Labor force participation  Ministry of Planning and  The economy of the \nMaldivians, men and  rate to increase by 5%  National Development   Maldives continues to \nwomen, actively  by 2009  census statistics  grow and create new \nparticipating in the labor    jobs \nMinistry of Human \nforce and employed   \nResources, Employment  Youths will actively seek \n \nand Labor (MHREL)  training and \nlabor market statistics  employment in \noccupations in the \nprivate sector, including \nblue-collar positions \nEmployers are going to \nhire more Maldivians \n       \nPurpose       \nProvide more  Increased access to a  Project monitoring and  Training needs are \nemployment-oriented  greater number of  evaluation data   identified in a timely \nskills training in various  employment-oriented  manner \nProject progress reports \noccupations and  skills training programs \nThere will be capacity to \nimprove the capacity to  in selected regions of the  Ministry of Education \ndeliver an increased \ndevelop and deliver  country and train at least  (MOE) and MHREL data \nnumber of training \ncompetency-based  6,000 youths \nReview missions  programs \nskills training (CBST)  \nGreater capacity by \n  Impact studies  The public is receptive \nrelevant education and \n    to media campaign and \ntraining providers to \n    information \ndevelop and deliver a \n    dissemination  \nrange of skills training \n     \nprograms \n \nMaldivians are better \ninformed of the \nemployment situation \nand opportunities in the \ncountry  \nAttitudes of parents and \nyouths toward skilled, \nvocational, and technical \noccupations are more \npositive \nLabor market information \nanalysis is improved \n       \n       \nComponents/Outputs       \n     \n1.

Between 1995 and 2000, the Maldives\u2019 economy grew at the average annual rate of \nabout 8%.1 During the same time period, the Maldivian labor force grew annually at the average \nof 5.3% annually while expatriate labor grew by 8.1%.2 The Maldives is highly dependent on \nskilled expatriate labor. Employers, including the Government, hire expatriate workers in the \nabsence of properly trained and qualified Maldivians. This is against the backdrop of untapped \nhuman resources, which includes the large number of youths who are not in the labor force; \nhave completed primary education but could not continue on to further education; and are \ncapable but have limited access to skills training programs. In 2000, there were over 25,000 \nyouths aged 15 to 19 (77% of the cohort)3 who were not in the labor force and over 21,000 of \nthose aged 20 to 34. In this connection, the Maldives faces the challenges of (i) making the \nprospective Maldivian employee more attractive to the employer, and (ii) making training and \nemployment more attractive to the Maldivian employee.   \n \n2.  Labor Force.  According to the 2000 Population and Housing Census (Census), only \n56% of working-age  Maldivians  were  in  the  labor  force4 and  about  a  third  of  them  were \nemployed  in  Mal\u00e9;  in  addition,  there  were  about  30,664  foreign  workers,  comprising \napproximately 24% of the total labor force.5 In 1990, there were only 8,700 expatriate workers or \n13% of the labor force. Repatriation of wages contributes significantly to the outflow of foreign \nexchange. A large number of expatriate jobs could eventually be filled by qualified Maldivians if \n(i) employment-oriented  education  and  training  programs  were  available;  (ii) a  systemic \napproach was used to coordinate resources and stakeholders in labor supply and employment \ndemand; and (iii) labor regulations were effectively implemented to ensure equal and equitable \nworking conditions, wages and benefits for women and men, Maldivians and expatriates. \n \n3.  In the 2000 Census, expatriates were mostly in unskilled (42%) and semiskilled (36%) \noccupations.  More  than  80%  were  employed  in  resorts,  construction,  business  activities, \neducation, apparel, and hotels and restaurants. In the resorts, most expatriates work as chefs, \ncooks,  bartenders,  accountants,  sports  instructors,  and  maintenance  laborers.  In  the \nconstruction sector, a large number work as carpenters, masons, construction laborers, drivers, \nand electricians. In business activities, they work as accountants, auditors, tailors, barbers, \ndrivers, and laborers. In education, most are employed as secondary school teachers. \n \n4.  Most of these jobs could be filled by Maldivians but the salaries paid to expatriate \nworkers are deemed too low and the working conditions, including the working hours and days, \nare  onerous.  Most  of  the  expatriate  workers  are  from  Bangladesh,  India,  and  Sri  Lanka. \nTypically, their remuneration packages include accommodation and once-a-year airfare to their \nhome country. Sample data indicate that even with extra benefits and expenses incurred by the \nemployer,  the  expatriate  workers  in  some  categories  receive  about  80%  to  85%  of  the \nMaldivian\u2019s salary and benefits.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Between 1995 and 2002, the average annual growth rate was 7%. \n2  Where labor force data comparisons are made, the reference date is 2000, when the last Census was conducted. \n3  This includes youths in school, over 20,000. However, this latter figure does not match enrollment figures in the \nMaldives College of Higher Education (MCHE), and the higher secondary schools. \n4  Population and Housing Census take 12 as the eligible age for employment. Until April 2003, the legal age for   \nworking and labor regulation was 14. As of May 2003, the minimum age has been increased to 18. This Project \nreport uses 15 and 64 as the reference ages. \n5  The percentage calculation includes Maldivians and expatriates as the total workforce. ", "28 Appendix 2 \n5.  Based on the current level of expatriate employment, there are about 14,000 skilled and \nsemiskilled jobs potentially eligible for suitably qualified Maldivians. The qualification category \n\u201csemiskilled\u201d consists primarily of artisans with little or no formal preparation for their field of \nemployment. Craft and trade workers such as electricians, carpenters, masons, welders, and \nplumbers have completed some form of apprenticeship including pre-apprenticeship training in \ntheoretical principles of their trade, applied mathematics, issues related to health, safety, and \nthe environment. Technician qualification generally requires basic education plus 1 or 2 years of \nstudy leading to a certificate. Technologists require 2 or 3 years of postsecondary studies \nleading to a diploma issued by a college, institute of technology, or polytechnic.   \n \n6.  Youths. The increased birthrate in the late 1980s and early 1990s has resulted in a \npopulation increase of youths now in their mid- to late-teens. This cohort of 15- to 19-year-old \ngirls and boys has completed primary school, is progressing through secondary school, and will \nsoon  be  seeking  access  to  further  education  or  employment.  Despite  the  expansion  of \nsecondary education, in 2002, approximately 5,357 boys and girls6 terminated their education at \nthe end of grade 7. Although more students may be going to secondary school and obtaining \nOrdinary-level  (O-level)  passes  in  the  future,  a  large  number  of  students  will  still  need \nemployment-oriented skills training. A large proportion of this cohort is unlikely to access further \neducation or employment-oriented training within the existing education and training system. \nWhile access to and quality of academic education continues to improve, greater consideration \nneeds to be given to the needs of the youths for whom further academic education will not be \npossible. \n \n7.  Demand  for  Skills  Training  and  Employment.  Students  who  leave  school  after \ncompleting grade 7 or who discontinue secondary studies without passing O-level examinations \nface  limited  employment  skills  training  opportunities.  Students  and  their  parents  seek \nopportunities when they leave school. Although the national labor force participation rate is \nrelatively  low,  attitudes  towards  employment  are  starting  to  change  as  evidenced  by  the \nincreasing  numbers  of  applicants  for  advertised  positions  in  Mal\u00e9.  Expectations  of  most \nstudents and parents are that children would continue on to higher education or obtain white-\ncollar jobs. During focus group discussions, youths indicated that they are interested in skilled \njobs. Constituents in the atolls are requesting various Maldives College of Higher Education \n(MCHE) faculties to offer more skills training programs, e.g., electrical wiring and housekeeping \nfor resorts. Prevailing social attitudes and parental concern for the welfare of girls continue to \nlimit female participation in employment away from the home island and community. Attitudes \nrelating to the employment of women in resorts are also changing with the increasing numbers \nof women being employed, mainly in clerical positions. There is a need to increase the very \nshort-term to short-term courses that can be more flexibly and regularly offered in various \nregions/islands. Skills training obtained should address the needs of the labor market and \nshould also be acceptable to students and their parents. \n \n8.  There is growing awareness and concern to find a solution to youth unemployment, \nwhich, at times, may go hand in hand with social ills such as drug abuse and involvement in \nantisocial  activities.  There  is  equally  a  greater  demand  by  youths  themselves  for  job \nopportunities.7 In the atolls and islands, employment expectations are frequently equated to a \njob in a government office or a career in education or health. Government demand or need for \nadditional employees in the next 10 years is expected to be less than the supply of youths \n                                                 \n6  By gender, 2,921 boys and 2,436 girls left school after grade 7. \n7  As seen in interviews with government ministries and private sector firms.  ", "                                                                                                                                                         Appendix 2  29\nseeking  employment.  New  employment  opportunities  are  required  and  a  reorientation  to \nnongovernment jobs is necessary.  \n \n9.  Provision of Skills Training. Preemployment skills training in the Maldives is being \nprovided by MCHE, through its various faculties, and private training providers. Many resorts \nand firms provide on-the-job training and/or finance the education or training courses of their \nemployees.  At  present,  short-term  preemployment  skills  training  courses  need  to  be \nstrengthened and expanded, to meet the human resource needs of the country and the needs \nof the large number of school leavers. Some employers expressed during project preparation \nthat secondary and postsecondary student-graduates are not properly trained for positions they \ntake on after graduation.   \n \n10.  The mandates of the faculties are for human resource development. For instance, the \nmandate  of  the  Faculty  of  Engineering  Technology  (FET)  (formerly,  Maldives  Institute  for \nTechnical Education) includes the development and provision of technical skills for industrial \ndevelopment in technical, manufacturing and engineering fields. All the faculties offer short-term \ntraining. The Center for Maritime Studies (CMS) offers mostly short training courses8 and, to \ndate, enrolls the most number of students. FET and the Faculty of Hospitality and Tourism \nStudies  (FHTS)  offer  short  courses  in  communities  outside  Mal\u00e9  when  requested  by \ncommunities and when there are resources to do so. At present, requests to FET and FHTS \nfrom atoll chiefs cannot all be met within their respective faculty budgets. Fees are charged for \nsome courses to cover learning materials and/or training delivery costs. CMS short courses \nhave, to date, enrolled only men; FET short courses9 are attended mostly by men while both \nwomen and men attend FHTS courses. \n \n11.  In addition to MCHE, other government agencies are involved in training. The Centre for \nContinuing  Education  of  the  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  coordinates  and  implements \nnonformal  education  programs  in  the  Maldives.  The  Centre  for  Continuing  Education's \nCondensed  Education  Program  has  achieved  considerable  success  in  providing  basic \neducation for adults previously unable to complete primary school. Other programs include \nEnglish language courses, vocational and technical skills development courses, secretarial skills \ndevelopment courses, training in early childhood care and development, population education, \nand  community  awareness  through  materials  production  and  publications.  The  Ministry  of \nFisheries, Agriculture and Marine Resources conducts agriculture- and fisheries-related skills \ntraining. The Ministry of Youth and Sports offers a variety of training activities for youths, for \nexample, sports-coaching, dressmaking, and hairdressing, in addition to  offering sports and \nrecreational programs in its youth centers. The Ministry of Human Resources, Employment and \nLabor (MHREL) has a loan scheme to fund skills training. \n \n12.  As of November 2002, 66 private training providers were registered with Ministry of \nEducation.10  The  majority  offer  computer  instruction  and  are  located  in  Mal\u00e9.  Accurate \nenrollment data on trainees are unavailable. In addition to private education and training firms, \nmany employers provide in-house training programs and courses for their employees. Larger \nfirms  provide  scholarships  and  support  the  education  and  professional  development  of \nemployees. The contribution of private enterprise to skills training is significant; however, no \n                                                 \n8  The majority of Center for Maritime Services  courses are less than 6 months. \n9  Courses include masonry and electrical wiring. \n10 In Mal\u00e9, there are 27 software application training providers. On islands other than Mal\u00e9 there are 29 computer \ntraining providers. Ten private providers focus on language and other training services. ", "30 Appendix 2 \nqualitative and quantitative data are available on the number of trainees or financial investment \nin on-the-job training and professional development.  \n  \n13.  With the establishment of the Maldives Accreditation Board (MAB) and the introduction \nof the Maldives National Qualifications Framework, the mechanism now exists for greater \nrecognition of private sector participation in education and training. However, there is currently \nno mechanism in place for MAB to deal with technical and vocational credentials that require a \nsystem of occupational qualification standards.  \n \n14.  Labor Regulations. Labor regulations and standards have to be updated and effectively \nimplemented to encourage employers to employ Maldivians and to encourage Maldivians to \nseek and stay in employment. There is a need for a systematic approach to monitor the \nimplementation of labor legislation and strengthen the capacity of MHREL for effective labor \nadministration and labor market analysis to help workers and employers alike. \n \n15.  The Maldives has an Employment Regulation but no labor law.11 A draft Employment \nAct,  prepared  with  the  technical  assistance  of  the  International  Labour  Organization,  was \nsubmitted by MHREL to the Law Commission and now needs to be submitted to the Cabinet for \ntheir recommendation to submit it to Parliament. Employment contracts are mandatory for both \nlocally engaged workers and all expatriate employees. The salaries and benefits of employment \nin the Maldives, as well as other working conditions such as working hours, are determined by \nnegotiations between employer and prospective employee, without any minimum standard set \nand monitored by the Government. There is no minimum wage. MHREL issues work permits, \nmonitors the expatriate quota system, and administers fee collection. At present, insufficient \nresources are allocated for monitoring the implementation of the Employment Regulation.  \n \n16.  Education. As of 2002, almost half of the population (46%) was under 15 years of age. \nProvision of education to over one third of its population is by no means a minor challenge for a \ndeveloping country like the Maldives, where students are scattered over 199 inhabited islands. \nDespite this fact, as of 2000, all children in the Maldives have access to the first 7 years of \nformal schooling, one of the landmark achievements of the country. Current challenges include \nthe expansion of secondary education and improving the quality of education. Free, public \neducation in the Maldives comprises 12 grades. Primary education is from grades 1 to 7, lower \nsecondary education is grades 8 to 10, and higher secondary education is grades 11 to 12.  \n \n17.  Secondary  Education.  Enrollment  data  for  grade  8  in  2002 indicates that 5,350 \nstudents (36%) of those enrolled in grade 7 the previous year in primary schools did not \ncontinue on to secondary schooling, mostly students in the atolls. Secondary schools are \navailable in atoll capitals and in the larger islands with high population. Admission to secondary \nschool requires successful completion of grade 7. In view of the limited number of secondary \nschools in the country, 74 secondary schools versus 452 primary schools, admission is limited \nby the availability of schools. For students from islands with no secondary schools, access is \nmade more difficult by the lack of affordable appropriate accommodation. The dropout rate from \nprimary to secondary grades is expected to decrease as more primary schools in the atolls are \nupgraded to secondary schools. From 29 schools offering secondary education in 1995, there \nwere 74 in 2000. Regardless, the number of youths unable to go on beyond grade 7 to \nsecondary education remains significant. \n \n                                                 \n11 The existing Employment Regulation of the Republic of Maldives came into effect on 1 January 1994. ", "                                                                                                                                                         Appendix 2  31\n18.  The secondary school system offers three streams: arts, commerce, and science. The \ncurriculum includes vocational-oriented subjects in the areas of tourism and fisheries. Most of \nthe secondary schools, especially those in the outer islands, offer the commerce stream, which \nrequires fewer resources. As a consequence, most secondary school completers are in the area \nof commerce and lack the knowledge required in further science-oriented programs.12 The \nofficial medium of instruction is English. At the end of grade 10, students typically sit for O-level \nexaminations. The pass rate in most subjects, including English,13 mathematics, and science, \nhowever, is less than 50%. In 2001, 73% of secondary school teachers were expatriates. As of \n2002, four schools offered higher secondary education, two of which were located in Mal\u00e9. \nThus, among those with O-levels qualifications, many are unable to go on to higher secondary \nschool. \n \n19.  Postsecondary  Education.  MCHE  was  established  in  1998  to  consolidate  the \nadministrative responsibility  for seven ministry-specific training institutes. The objective is to \nincrease the national capacity to provide postsecondary education and training to meet the \nhuman resource development needs of the Maldives. MCHE has six faculties and two centers, \nnamely, Faculty of Health Sciences, FHTS, Faculty of Management and Computing Science, \nFaculty of Education, FET, and Faculty of Shariah and Law. The centers are the Center for \nOpen Learning and CMS. The six faculties are housed in separate buildings throughout Mal\u00e9.14 \nFive regional facilities, formerly known as the Regional Youth Vocational Training Centers are \nunder FET\u2019s administration.  \n \n20.  In 2002, MCHE offered programs of varying duration and admission requirements. Long-\nterm courses ranged from certificate to bachelor degree courses with most requiring two or \nthree O-level passes.15 MCHE\u2019s enrollment in long-term courses increased from 1,473 in 1999 \nto 1,731 in 2002. Enrollment in short-courses rose from 1,727 in 1999 to 2,565 in 2002. Most of \nthe short-term enrollment was with CMS.  \n \n21.  MCHE  is  presently  receiving  Asian  Development  Bank  assistance16  focused  on \ndeveloping diploma and advanced certificate courses through faculty development and course \nreviews, as well as program accreditation.  MCHE is restructuring its programs, expanding its \ncourse offerings, and increasing its presence in the country. Curricula are being updated and \nrevised to meet the requirements of MAB.  \n                                                 \n12 Students completing the commerce stream wishing to pursue postsecondary studies in areas other than commerce \nhave to take a bridging course. \n13 The pass rate of English in 2002 was 6%. \n14 There is also an in-service center in Hithadhoo. \n15 For 2003, most of these entry requirements have been made less stringent, but still within the Maldives National \nQualifications Framework. \n16 ADB.1998.

Employment  sector  councils  (ESCs)  will  be  established  in  four  sectors\u2014tourism, \nfisheries and agriculture, transportation, and the social sectors.1 Each council will undertake \nstudies and advise the Project on the qualitative and quantitative human resources needs of \neach sector. The purpose of each ESC is to provide a sustainable mechanism to accurately \ndefine the immediate and future demand for human resources. The goal is to reduce the gap \nbetween employer demand for qualified workers and the supply of appropriately qualified \nMaldivian labor.   \n \nA.  Objectives \n  \n2.  The objectives of the ESCs are to: (i) increase efficiency and effectiveness of investment \nin employment-oriented training; (ii) identify policy issues impacting on labor market efficiency in \nthe Maldives and to engage in dialogue with Ministry of Human Resources, Employment and \nLabor to achieve resolution; (iii) assist in developing occupational competency standards that \nwill enable the Maldives Accreditation Board, training providers, employers and individuals to \ndescribe the knowledge, skills and attitudes required to effectively function in various sector-\nspecific occupations; (iv) recommend training and personnel development that will enhance the \nfinancial and economic efficiency of the sector; (v) enhance the value of the labor market \ninformation system by providing gender-disaggregated data on categories and demand for \nemployment; and (vi) provide information that will promote greater employment awareness and \nparticipation of women through improved social marketing and career guidance initiatives. \n \nB.   Organization \n \n3.  As a representative body of public and private employers and employees in the four \nsectors of the economy, each ESC will consist of a chairperson selected by the respective \nMinistry and eight representatives selected from private and public firms. A minimum of two \nrepresentatives on each ESC will be female.  \n \n4.  The ministry or ministries responsible for each sector will appoint a chairperson.  The \nESC for the social sector will be chaired by one person representing the Ministry of Health and \nthe Ministry of Education. The chairperson of each ESC will be the spokesperson and will \nprovide leadership for project activities. In consultation with the human resources development \nspecialist, the chairperson for each sector will recruit the members of the ESC. The selection \ncriteria for ESC membership require each member to have a minimum of 5 years experience \nand  be  actively  working  or  otherwise  engaged  in  the  sector.  ESC  members  should  be \nconsidered by their peers to be knowledgeable, credible, and highly regarded for their work in \ndeveloping the sector.  \n \n5.  Each ESC will consist of public and private representation at a ratio to be determined by \nthe total personnel employed by private firms or institutions compared to the total personnel \nemployed by public firms or institutions within the respective sector. Representatives will be \nselected for the following categories of ESC membership: (i) one chairperson, recommended by \nthe  respective  ministry  or  ministries;  (ii) two  employer  representatives  from  Mal\u00e9  Region;         \n                                                 \n1  Social sector human resources development employment consists of public and private education and health \ninstitutions.

Functions \n \n6.  A central secretariat will provide the administrative and clerical support to the four ESCs. \nA Human Resource Development Training Specialist (HRDTS) will be assigned to each ESC. \nThe duties of the HRDTS include responsibility for ensuring that the work of each council is \nachieved. The HRDTS will report to the project implementation unit. The major activity of each \nESC is to prepare a human resource profile and strategy that includes an accurate description \nof the immediate and medium-term employment needs of the sector. The identification of \nworkforce needs will be the basis for the preparation of a strategic plan describing how these \nneeds could be addressed.  \n \n7.  At the formative stages of the ESC, the frequency and duration of meetings is likely to be \ngreater than in subsequent years. Monthly meetings will be held in the first 6 months followed by \nquarterly meetings thereafter. ESC membership is voluntary and there is no remuneration or fee \npaid  for  member  participation  in  ESC  activities.  Out-of-pocket  costs,  including  travel  and \naccommodation, for attending meetings and other business of the ESC will be paid by the \nProject. In situations where employers are reluctant to authorize employee participation on the \nESC because of the salary cost to the firm, reimbursement of the cost of releasing their \nemployee for ESC business will be provided by the Project.  \n \n8.  The strategic plans developed by each sector will include a history of the sector, specify \nthe current status of human resources, and forecast the trends and future needs. Action plans \nfocusing on critical skills shortages will be developed in order to prioritize training and staff \ndevelopment activities. Areas deemed to be in greatest need of qualified Maldivians will be the \nsubject of formal proposals from the ESC to the project steering committee.  \n \n9.  Each ESC will identify people to serve on technical committees to prepare occupational \ntask analysis for key occupations. This will include the identification of occupations in the sector; \nthe number of employers, and the number of employees by category and gender; local or \nexpatriate; required credential; and a breakdown of duties, skills, and tasks associated with the \nselected occupation. Skill and task definition will be compiled using an occupational task \nanalysis  process  that  will  guide  curriculum  development  for  training  program  design  and \ndevelopment.  \n \n10.  The strategic human resources development plan developed by ESCs will identify the \noccupations  in  which  skills  need  to  be  strengthened,  new  training  programs  introduced, \nemployability skills developed, expatriate replacement strategies established, and other human \nresources development issues addressed. The plans will include cooperative strategies to \nemploy more Maldivians and provide feedback on the quality of training and performance of \ngraduates. ESCs will form a natural network of employers capable of providing information for \nthe  promotion  of  careers  in  their  sector  and  facilitating  processes  for  recruitment  and \nemployment of graduates.   \n \n11.  Introduction of this new employer demand-driven approach will require time for the \nmerits of the system to be validated and embraced by employers, training providers and \ngovernment.  It  is  expected  that  the  introduction  of  the  ESC  concept  will  stimulate  other ", "Appendix 4  35\ninitiatives potentially funded from resources within various employment sectors. These may \ninclude continued policy dialogue, increased support for work experience programs, introduction \nof initiatives promoting greater female participation in the workforce, supporting career guidance \nprograms, and developing workforce capacity to meet new quality standards. \n \nD.   Implementation and Sustainability  \n \n12.  The ESCs play a key role identifying the employer demand-driven needs to ensure \nrelevance of training programs supplied by public and private training providers. As such, the \nESCs will need to be operational from the start of project implementation. Identification of \nrepresentatives for ESC membership could begin prior to the start of the project.  \n \n13.  Sustainability of the ESC process may be possible as the low cost of participation \ncombined with reduced frequency of meetings following 5 years  of  operation  will  promote \nsustainability. The benefits of an effective ESC will be sufficient justification for their post-project \ncontinuity.   \n \n \n \n \n ", " \n36 Appendix 5 \nFUNDING TRAINING: \nINDICATIVE OPERATIONS MANUAL \n \n \nA.   Project Overview \n \n1.  The Government of the Maldives, concerned with rising unemployment, particularly in \nregions outside Mal\u00e9, has launched a program with Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance \nto  increase  opportunity  and  access  to  employment-oriented  education  and  training.  The \nproposed Project consists of three components designed specifically for youths, aged 16 to 34, \nand adults previously unable to continue their education or training.  \n \n2.  Funds will be used to design, develop, and deliver competency-based training programs \nrelevant to the identified needs of the economic sector for which the programs are designed. \nThis includes support for developing occupational profiles, detailed occupational task analyses, \ncurriculum design, and instructional materials development. Partial cost-recovery of the funds \nawarded will be included in the contractual agreement for its award and use.   \n \n3.  Objectives. The objectives of this project component are as follows: (i) provide financial \nresources to develop and deliver employment-oriented education and training for Maldivian \nyouth to develop the competencies, qualifications, and attitudes essential for employment; \n(ii) provide mechanisms to deliver training in locations relevant to the needs of the employer and \npotential employee; (iii) establish procedures to monitor and evaluate the employment and \nproductivity impact of the Project's interventions; (iv) assess the efficiency and effectiveness of \ncollaboratively designed training, when delivered competitively by Maldives College of Higher \nEducation, and other public and private providers; and (v) develop policies and procedures for \npartial cost recovery of funds and establishing a sustainable financing mechanism for skills \ntraining.   \n \n4.  Project  Scope.  The  Project  will  provide  financial  support  for  the  preparation  of \nworkforce occupational profiles, task analyses, skills standards, and a human resource (HR) \nstrategic plan for four key sectors, namely, tourism, fisheries and agriculture, transportation, and \nthe social sectors. The workforce profiles will identify the public and private employers currently \nactive in the sector, together with levels of employment and categories of employee listed by \nInternational Standard Occupational Classification (ISOC) 88 classification codes, and provide \nindicative information regarding individuals engaged in informal employment in the sector. \nOccupational profiles will describe the principal tasks undertaken by each category of employee. \nThis information will be collected against a template to be provided by the project in a manner \nthat will support a \u201cdeveloping a curriculum\u201d (DACUM) process for subsequent training program \ndevelopment  initiatives.  Preparation  of  HR  strategic  plans  will  describe  the  employment \nenvironment in the sector, identify strategic issues, and formulate action plans to address critical \nskills shortages or skill gaps in individual occupations. The studies and analyses component will \nalso provide resources for capacity building among the employment sector councils (ESCs) and \ntheir membership in the process of writing competitive proposals for submission to the fund. \n \n5.  The  Project  supports  youth  and  adults  in  basic  skill  development  for  entry-level \nemployment.  It  is  also  possible  to  support  further  or  supplementary  training  of  existing \nemployees in order to close critical skills gaps. The required training will be identified by \nemployers and will be provided by Maldives College of Higher Education, existing public sector \ntraining providers, private sector providers, employers themselves, or any combination thereof. \n ", "Appendix 5       37\nB.   Project Management \n \n6.  Institutional  Arrangements.  Project  funds  will  be  overseen  by  the  project \nimplementation unit (PIU). Policy and administrative decisions will be the responsibility of the \nproject steering committee (PSC). Funding policies will be prepared within the guidelines of the \nPSC.  \n \n7.  Procurement. Procurement contracts for impact assessment studies or other outputs \nwill be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Individual consultants \nmay be hired to supplement the capacity of the PIU. The private sector, employers and/or \nemployees, will be represented in the technical evaluation/selection committees.  \n \n8.  Disbursement. To ensure that funds are readily available for project implementation \nand to facilitate disbursement, an imprest account will be established. Disbursements will be \nsupported  by  invoices  and  receipts  from  training  providers  or  suppliers.  Authorization  for \npayment will require the signatures of the PIU director and the ESC chairperson to whom the \nservices are provided.  \n \n9.  Project Workshop. Project funding activities will be launched at a training workshop, \nconvened following establishment of the ESCs. The training session will introduce the concepts \nand operational modalities. The workshop will be planned and designed in cooperation with the \nPIU and ESC chairpersons, and the staff of the Maldives Network for Employment Training \n(MNET) executive director. Participants will include key stakeholders such as representatives of \nemployers, and public and private training providers. \n \nC.  Activities and Procedures \n \n10.  Priority activities eligible for project support include: (i) training for potential new entrants \nin occupations of priority need as identified by ESCs; (ii) training for occupations currently \noccupied by expatriates who will eventually be replaced by Maldivian employees as agreed by \nESCs and further described in each sector\u2019s HR strategic plan; (iii) training for occupations of \nfuture need as identified by national economic priorities; and (iv) training of individuals engaged \nin  the  informal  sector  to  enhance  income  generation  opportunities.  As  second  priority, \nassistance may also be extended to: (i) training undertaken on the job to enhance the efficiency \nof  existing  workers  within  a  particular  occupational  category  and  (ii) training  of  existing \nemployees off the job to develop new skills directly linked to employment. \n \n11.  Activities not eligible for funding include: (i) long-term scholarships (1 year and longer), \n(ii) participation  in  conferences,  (ii) fees  for  external  examinations,  (iii) membership  fees  in \nprofessional associations or societies, and (iv) other expenditures deemed to be of personal \nbenefit only to the applicant. \n \n12.  Agencies Eligible for Funding. The four ESCs representing tourism, fisheries and \nagriculture,  transportation,  and  the  social  sectors  will  be  eligible  to  submit  proposals. \nCompanies and community groups, including the informal sector, who wish to participate in the \nprogram will process their proposals through the most appropriate ESC.  \n \n13.  Beneficiaries of Supported Training. The proposed project will pilot activities in three \nregions,  namely  the  Northern  and  Southern  Development  Regions  and  Mal\u00e9  island  and \nadjacent atolls. Consequently, a higher priority will be given to proposals that provide training ", " \n38 Appendix 5 \nopportunities to residents of these regions. Women and men from all regions of the country will \nbe the eligible beneficiaries.  \n \n14.  Request for Proposals.  The PIU will request submission of proposals for training. \nESCs will be invited to submit up to a maximum of five proposals per ESC annually. Proposals \nwill be evaluated against the criteria established and disseminated by the PSC. Contracts will be \nawarded to the ESCs based on the amount of money available for each round of funding.  \n \n15.  Proposal Content. Detailed guidelines for the preparation of proposals will be provided \nin the request for proposals. This will include as a minimum: (i) definition of the occupation for \nwhich training is to be provided; (ii) identification of employment demand, and details of member \ncompanies employing this category of employee; (iii) specific occupational competencies to be \nbuilt;  (iv) information  regarding  the  proposed  training  provider  and  rationale  for  selection; \n(v) details  of  the  proposed  training  program  and  individual  trainers;  (vi) course  or  training \nactivity, content and duration; (vii) trainee performance assessment approach; (viii) credential or \ncertificate to be awarded, if any; (ix) cost of the proposed training; amount requested from the \nProject and any contribution, direct or in kind, that is being provided by the ESC and/or its \nmembers; (x) criteria for the selection of candidates for training; and (xi) commitment of the \nCouncil or its members to engage graduates upon completion of training and under what \nconditions.  ESCs  should  access  the  services  of  MNET  to  facilitate  occupational  analysis, \ndefinition of competencies, DACUM processes, and training program design when preparing \ntheir proposals for funding \n \n16.  Selection  of  Projects  for  Funding.  The  PSC  will  evaluate  proposals  against  the \nfollowing criteria: (i) compliance with eligibility criteria, (ii) consistency with project objectives, \n(iii) cost efficiency, and (iv) employment potential on completion of training. \n \nD.  Financial and Contractual Arrangements \n \n17.  Financial Conditions.  The maximum total amount of any training project proposal \nshould not exceed $50,000. The maximum total amount to be financed by the Project for any \nindividual trainee should not exceed $2,500. Employers may wish to group trainees for certain \nhigh-cost training (e.g., high-tech training or training provided by a foreign expert). The following \nitems  will  be  covered  by  the  financing:  (i) training  providers\u2019  fees  or  salary  (direct  or \nsubcontracted);  (ii) consumables  linked  to  training  such  as  materials,  video/audio  tapes, \nsoftware etc.; (iii) operating cost linked to training such as rent, utilities, support, etc.; and       \n(iv) training providers\u2019 travel and accommodation directly related to training program delivery. \nTrainees\u2019 salaries will be excluded from financing. \n \n18.  Contracting Procedures. Following proposal approval, the PIU will prepare a contract \nspecifying the responsibilities of each party including the ESC and the firms or agencies \ninvolved in the design, development, and delivery of training. The contract will include the \nfollowing information: (i) ESC name, (ii) names of the beneficiaries to be trained, (iii) name of \ntraining provider, (iv) training program details, (v) details of any sub-agreements with private or \nexternal training providers, (vi) training program costs, (vii) qualification to be awarded upon \nsuccessful  completion  of  the  training,  and  (viii) obligations  of  all  parties  on  completion  of \ntraining. Contracts will be signed by the director of the PIU and the ESC chairperson.  \n \n19.  Payment for Services. The training or service provider will submit claims for payment to \nthe PIU. The PIU will process the requested payment, provide authorization to claims complying ", "Appendix 5       39\nwith the contractual agreement, and authorize payment. The PIU will verify compliance of \nprocedures and legitimacy of the claim prior to processing the payment. \n \nE.  Monitoring, Studies, and Evaluation \n \n20.  Monitoring. Monitoring will review and assess the implementation of the technical \nprocedures, in particular: (i) the procedures to evaluate proposals submitted by ESCs, (ii) the \nimplementation of training programs, and (iii) the proper use of support services provided \nthrough MNET or other sources. Monitoring will be undertaken through two types of review. \nAnnual operational reviews will analyze the previous year\u2019s technical performance and financial \nmanagement using monitoring indicators agreed to by ADB. The reviews will be in respect of all \noperations financed by the Project and will review actual project performance against the annual \nplan of operations and the approved budget for the year. Staff of the PIU will carry out field \nreviews targeted at specific operations financed by the fund. These reviews will monitor, in \ndepth, a limited number of training projects as well as information and support services. Field \nreviews will focus on qualitative analysis of selected projects and services. \n \n21.  Specific performance indicators will be developed including: (i) the percentage of funds \nallocated  to  public  providers,  private  providers,  or  employer-provided  training,  in  order  to \nindicate the competition between the sectors; (ii) unit costs of training courses or projects, \nadjusted for length of course and inputs, in order to provide a measure of cost-effectiveness of \ntraining provided; (iii) the number and socioeconomic profile of trainees; and (iv) post-training \nemployment experience of trainees including employment characteristics and wage levels. \n \n22.  Full details of the monitoring activities will be agreed upon with the PIU and finalized \nthrough consulting services to be provided to the project. Account will need to be taken of the \nease with which information can be collected, and  the ability to manipulate and collate the \ninformation. Records to be maintained include statistics on a range of information. On employer \napplicants and beneficiaries, information will be collected on employer groups applying for \nsupport  and  will  include  the  type  of  industry,  number  of  employees,  product,  or  service, \ngeographic location and other details. From training providers, information to be collected will \ninclude, ownership, public or private, size, course, and cost details. Information will be collected \non all trainees and will include demographic data, skills/education prior to training, family, \ngeographic information, occupation, or skill training provided and income details. Financial \nrecords will be maintained by the PIU for purposes of audit, analysis and reporting. Review \nactivities will be conducted. Training providers will be required to submit reports on their \nactivities at the completion of each course or training project. Information will be collected and \nmaintained on extent of on the job training provided, details of training, attrition, etc. \n \n23.  Evaluation. Evaluation will be undertaken by the PIU monitoring and evaluation unit \nthrough the mechanism of tracer and impact assessment studies. From employers, studies will \naddress  the  effectiveness  of  project  operations  in  terms  of  identifying  the  occupational \ncompetencies  required  by  employees,  providing  training  program  development  services, \nidentifying  appropriate  candidates  for  training  and  providing  training  programs  to  prepare \ncandidates  for  employment.  On  trainees,  studies  will  assess  the  short-  and  medium-term \noutcomes of the training programs financed by the Project in terms of employment opportunities \ngenerated, earnings for the beneficiaries, regional distribution, retention rates after employment, \nand other relevant factors.

Economic Analysis \n \n1.  The Maldives\u2019 economy grew at an annual average of 8%, in real terms, between 1995 \nand 2000. During the same time period, the number of Maldivians in the labor force grew by 5% \nannually while the number of expatriate workers increased 8% per year. The economy of the \nMaldives is expected to continue growing. Between 2004 and 2007, annual real gross domestic \nproduct growth is forecast to average between 6.2% and 2.6%. As the economy continues to \nexpand, more trained people will be required; in the absence of locally available qualified and \ntrained labor, expatriate workers are hired to fill the gap. This is against the backdrop of \nuntapped human resources, i.e., the large number of youths who are not in the labor force, who \nhave completed primary education but could not continue on to further education, and who are \ncapable but have limited access to skills training programs. Additionally, the Maldives is already \nheavily  dependent  on  imported  merchandise,  and  the  employment  of  expatriate  workers \ncontributes to the further deterioration of its current account balance.   \n \n2.  Government  intervention  in  skills  training,  either  in  provision  and/or  financing,  is \nrationalized on the grounds of market imperfections, externalities, and equity.1 Public policy, \ne.g., employment regulations, may unintentionally distort the cost and benefit stream of skills \ntraining such that less training than required by economic development would take place. The \navailability of skilled labor would contribute to meeting the macroeconomic goals of a country, \nnotably  addressing  balance-of-payments  problems  and  retention  of  foreign  exchange  and \navailability of semi-skilled human resources.     \n \n3.  The Project will focus on delivering training in four key sectors\u2014tourism, fisheries and \nagriculture, transport, and the social sectors\u2014that are included in the national development \npriority and play an important role in the continued economic well-being of the country. Tourism \nis mainly a private sector activity, a major employment sector, and the major source of foreign \nexchange revenue. Tourism also employs many expatriate workers, ranging from the skilled to \nthe unskilled. In the fisheries sector, two fishing zones have been opened up for private sector \ninvestment and will require more workers in the near future. The development of agriculture is \nimportant to national food security. Transportation is an extremely important and growing sector \nsupporting both tourism and the fisheries. An international airport will soon be operational in the \nsouthern region. The social sector, consisting primarily of education and health, is critical to the \nwell-being of the population and is currently heavily reliant on expatriate employment. \n \n4.  The  economic  justification  of  the  Project  derives  mainly  from  increased  access  to \ntraining programs that are relevant to the needs of the labor market. About  6,000 trainees will \nbe trained during the life of the Project by supporting the development and delivery of more \ntraining programs that are employment-oriented and are competency-based in the four key \nsectors.  Depending  on  trainees\u2019  capacity  to  pay,  the  demand  for  the  training  program, \nemployment prospects, and the remuneration of  related jobs, students may be requested to \nshare in the costs. Fees are already being charged for some short-term courses at the Maldives \nCollege of Higher Education faculties and center to cover learning materials and/or training \ndelivery costs. Trainees  may also incur out-of-pocket costs to pay for their transportation, \nsubsistence, and accommodation, where applicable. Trainees will mostly be drawn from the \n                                                 \n1  Lauglo, L., A. Akyeampong, K. Mwiria, and S. Weeks. December 2002.

Despite the demand-oriented nature of the Project, where the exact training programs to \nbe delivered are not identified in advance, data collected during project preparation indicated job \nvacancies during project life that are likely to be filled by trained and qualified Maldivians. The \noccupations where positions may be available and the number of people that may be sought in \nthe four sectors of the Project are indicated in Table A12. Many required occupations are not \nunique to a sector, e.g., office clerks and refrigeration technicians. \n \n6.  Indicative Economic Rate of Return. The Project\u2019s indicative economic rate of return is \n33%. The main beneficiaries of the Project are the unemployed out-of-school youths. The \nProject will train about 6,000 youths. In view of the lack of information relating to trainees\u2019 \nplacement, several assumptions were made. About half of the trainees would be able to find \nemployment in the year following the completion of their training. As the economy of the \nMaldives diversifies and more jobs are created, trainees may want to re-train and switch \noccupations to earn higher salaries or work in islands closer to their home-islands; thus, \ntrainees are assumed to be in the training-program-related employment for 5 years. Trainees\u2019 \nmonthly salary is assumed at Rf2,000 per month. Sample salary data collected during project \npreparatory technical assistance from the tourism sector indicate that waiters earn Rf1,200 to \nRf2,000, and maintenance personnel, Rf1,500 to Rf4,000. Trainees\u2019 out-of-pocket training costs \nare  estimated  at  Rf1,500  per  month,  which  includes  transportation,  accommodation,  and \nsubsistence that may likely be incurred if training were offered in another island. The average \nlength of training programs is about 3 months. The discount rate is 12%. Sensitivity was tested \nby increasing costs and benefits by 20%; the Project remains economically justified under these \nconditions. \n  \nB.   Financial Analysis \n \n7.  The Government\u2019s share in the project is estimated at $1.5 million over 5 years and will \nconsist mainly of the incremental recurrent cost of $1.0 million and share in special programs of \n$0.3 million. Two scenarios were prepared to analyze its affordability (i) a \u201chigh\u201d scenario where \nthe education budget was projected based on the actual expenditure from 1995 to 2001; and \n(ii) a \u201clow\u201d scenario where the education budget remains the same from 2002 onward. Under \nboth  scenarios,  the  Government\u2019s  share  in  the  both  the  project  and  recurrent  costs  are \naffordable. \n \n8.  The annual share of the Government in the project cost was compared to the annual \neducation budget (high scenario) for the years 2004 to 2009. The Government\u2019s annual share \nas a percentage of the education budget ranges from 0.3% to 0.6%, averaging 0.5% over the 5-\nyear life of the Project. The Government\u2019s share in the recurrent cost was also compared to the \neducation recurrent budget for 2004 to 2009. The Government\u2019s share as a percentage of the \neducation recurrent budget averaged 0.3% over the life of the project. From the sixth year \nonward,  after  the  project  implementation  has  ended,  the  Government  will  assume  about \n$97,000 annually for the incremental recurrent cost, which will have to be incurred as a result of \nproject interventions. This amount is only 0.2% of the projected education recurrent budget for \nthat year. Hence the Government share in both the project and recurrent cost are deemed \naffordable. \n \n ", "    Appendix 12  55\nTable A12: Estimated Indicative Training Needs by Occupation \n  Occupation  Tourism  Transport  Fisheries  Social  Total \n    F  M   F  M  F  M  F  M  F+M \n1  Accountant  100  50  100  50  50  25  50  25  450 \n2  Bookkeeper   100  50  50  25  25  25  50  25  350 \n3  Cashier   100  25  25  10  20  10  50  25  265 \n4  Office Clerk  75  25  50  25  50  25  50  25  325 \n5  Storekeeper  25  25  15  15  10  10  50  25  175 \n6  Driver (Passenger Car and Van)   50  50  25  25  25  25  10  5  215 \n7  Driver (Truck)  25  25  15  15  10  10  50  50  200 \n8  Refrigeration Repair Technician   10  50  10  25  10  25  10  25  165 \n9  Air Conditioning Repair Technician  10  25  5  25  5  25  5  10  110 \n10  Computer Networking Technician   25  25  25  25  25  25  25  25  200 \n11  Carpenter  10  100  0  0  0  0  5  10  125 \n12  Electrician   10  100  0  0  5  25  5  10  155 \n13  Plumber  10  100  0  0  0  5  10  25  150 \n14  Painter  25  100  10  25  0  0  25  50  235 \n15  Mechanic (Automobile)   0  0  50  150  0  0  0  0  200 \n16  Mechanic (Marine)  10  50  10  100  5  100  0  0  275 \n17  Generator Operator / Repair   5  25  0  0  0  25  0  0  55 \n18  Water Treatment Operator / Repair  5  25  0  0  0  25  0  0  55 \n19  Fiberglass Boat Building and Repair   0  0  10  50  5  25  0  0  90 \n20  Gas Welding and Cutting   0  0  5  25  0  0  0  0  30 \n21  Electric Welding and Fabrication  0  0  5  25  0  0  0  0  30 \n22  Radio Communication Technician  10  50  10  50  10  50  0  0  180 \n23 Maintenance Supervisor  10  50  10  50  5  25  10  50  210 \n24 Housekeeping Attendant  100  50  0  0  0  0  0  0  150 \n25  Housekeeping Supervisor  100  50  0  0  0  0  25  25  200 \n26  Waiter / Waitress  200  200  0  0  0  0  0  0  400 \n27  Food and Beverage Supervisor  100  100  0  0  0  0  0  0  200 \n28  Front Office Operations  100  100  0  0  0  0  100  25  325 \n29  Tour Guide   25  25  0  0  0  0  0  0  50 \n30  Chef   50  50  0  0  0  0  0  0  100 \n31  Cook  500  300  0  0  0  0  50  50  900 \n32  Pastry / Bakery Chef   200  100  0  0  0  0  0  0  300 \n33  Sports Facilities Attendant  25  25  0  0  0  0  0  0  50 \n34  Sports Coach  50  50  0  0  0  0  0  0  100 \n35  Boat Captain   0  0  10  50  10  50  0  0  120 \n36  Security Guard (Airport)  0  0  25  50  0  0  0  0  75 \n37  Security Guard (General)   50  100  25  50  0  50 25  50  350 \n38  Logistics Clerk  5  50  10  100  10  100 10  50  335 \n39  Customs Broker  0  0  50  50  25  25  0  0  150 \n40  Gardener  50  50  0  0  50  50  0  0  200 \n41  Fish Processing Operator  0  0  0  0  50  50  0  0  100 \n42  Fish Quality Control Inspector  0  0  0  0  50  50  0  0  100 \n43  Extension Worker  0  0  0  0  50  50    200  200  500 \n44  School Office Clerk  0  0  0  0  0  0     100        50  150 \n45  Hospital Housekeeping   0  0  0  0  0  0      100        50  150 \n46  Nurses Aide  0  0  0  0  0  0      100        50  150 \n47  Hospital Records Clerk  0  0  0  0  0  0      100        50  150 \n48  Hospital Orderly  0  0  0  0  0  0      100        50  150 \n49  Hospital Translator   0  0  0  0  0  0       50        25  75 \n50  Hospital Ward Clerk   0  0  0  0  0  0        50        25  75 \n  Total  2,170  2,200  550  1,015  505  910  1,415  1,085  9,850 \nF = female, M = male. \nSources: Project preparatory technical assistance participatory planning meetings; interviews; focus groups; Maldives \nAssociation for Tourism Industry; Ministry of Human Resources, Employment and Labor; Ministry of Planning and \nNational Development; Ministry of Education; and Ministry of Youth and Sports.    \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "56 Appendix 12 \n9.

Yes   poverty partnership agreement?  Yes \n   \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the Maldives: \n \nThe Project aims to increase the number of skilled Maldivians participating in the labor force and who will \nbe  attractive  to  local  employers  by  increasing  access  to  quality  employment-oriented skills training \nprograms, among others. Participation of Maldivians in the economic development process by being \nemployed allows for their sharing in the benefits of economic growth. Employment is a sustainable \napproach to poverty reduction. Training programs supported by the Project will be offered not only in Mal\u00e9 \nand adjacent atolls but also in islands in the Northern and Southern Development regions where the more \nvulnerable Maldivians live. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                     Proposed Classification Poverty Intervention \n \nThe Mission relied on statistics, studies, and reports by the Government, Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nUnited Nations Development Program (UNDP), and the World Bank. Relevant statistics were analyzed \nfrom  the  2000  Population  and  Housing  Census  data  of  the  Government.  ADB  published  Poverty \nReduction  in  the  Maldives  in  2002  and  the  Maldives  Gender  Briefing  Paper,  and  UNDP  produced \nVulnerability and Poverty Assessment 1998.  The  project preparatory technical assistance team also \ncollected information through the focus group discussions and participatory workshops held in various \nislands in the country. \nThe human development index for Maldives in 2001 is 0.739, ranking it 77th out of 162 countries, and the \ngender development index, at 0.735, is second only to that of Sri Lanka in South Asia.1 High and rising per \ncapita income masks significant income disparities among the 270,000 Maldivians. The 1998 vulnerability \nand poverty assessment (VPA)2 estimated per capita household income for the atoll population at only \n$647 per year. As many as 42% of Maldivians live on less than $1.17 per day while 22% subsist on $0.83 \nper day. Significant differences exist between Mal\u00e9 and the atolls in terms of access to services and \ninfrastructure, including health, sanitation, water, and education. Some islands have made considerable \nstrides because of their close proximity to tourism zones. Other islands have no such advantage and are \nbarely accessible. Taking income as an example, disparities between Mal\u00e9 and the atolls have been found \nto be in the order of 2:1, with the ratio increasing to 3:1 when the lowest average per capita income was \nconsidered. For access to social and physical infrastructure and  services, inequalities are far more \npronounced, averaging 4:1 between the capital and the atolls. This is a challenge that the Government \nhas sought to address since the 1970s, which today has resulted in policy initiatives to develop growth \ncenter islands in five regions to reduce disparities in access to essential services between Mal\u00e9 and the \natolls. The Project builds on the ongoing ADB-financed Regional Development Project by including its \nfocus regions in the Project\u2019s focus regions. Training programs will be offered not only in Mal\u00e9 but also in \nthe islands. Community training initiatives will address the needs of the smaller islands that have less \naccess to training programs and formal employment. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  United Nations Development Programme.

Participation Process \nParticipatory  consultations  were  held  during  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  with  the \nrepresentatives of the communities, youths, women, government, and private sector employers to identify \nneeds and to discuss proposed skill training program in various sectors. During project implementation, \nparticipatory processes will be developed to involve relevant stakeholders and to identify human resources \ndevelopment needs in different sectors, and design competency-based skills training programs. The social \nmarketing program will include popular media and participatory process to motivate female and male \nyouths, and women, and to reach out to trainees from the poor and remote islands. Training delivery will \nemploy techniques based on the principles and practices of learner-focused adult education.  \n \nD.         Gender and Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:    \n \nThe Government is committed to increasing the role of women in the society and economy. Vision 2020 of \nthe Government targets gender equity, with the active participation of men and women in political, social, \nand economic activities, which is also one of the key social priorities of the Sixth National Development \nPlan. There is no institutional discrimination along gender lines in access to primary and secondary \neducation. School enrolment rates for girls and boys are almost same, and, in 2002, there were more girls \nthan boys in Mal\u00e9 and the atolls in secondary school. Many women are employed in the public sector, \nincluding in education and health services. However, women\u2019s labor force participation rate (32%) is less \nthan men\u2019s (62%).  \n \nThe Project aims to increase number of skilled Maldivian youths actively participating in the labor force by \nincreasing access to quality competency-based skills training and social marketing and career guidance, \namong others. The client group of the Project includes young men and women between 15 and 34 years \nold.   \n \nThe Project will develop mechanisms for equal access to training by men and women and would address \ngender disparity in the labor market through the career guidance and employment services training \nprogram. The design features of the Project includes the following measures to address gender issues: \n \n(i)  Women will comprise at least 40% of the trainees. \n(ii)  Social  marketing  programs  will  be  designed  to  motivate  employers  and  communities  to \nincrease the participation of young women in the tourism, fisheries, transport, and social \nsectors.  \n(iii)  The social marketing component is focused on promoting employment and informing the \npublic of the range of careers for women and men. It also addresses the employment of \nwomen in tourism and related sectors.  \n(iv)  Emphasis will be given to include female teachers for training on career guidance. \n(v)  Women, as well as men, will be trained to assist in employment information dissemination in \nthe selected islands. \n(vi)  Strengthening the labor administration capacity of Ministry of Human Resources, Employment \nand Labor should lead to a general improvement in work environment that would encourage \nthe greater participation of women in the labor market.  \n(vii)  The employment sector councils will include female members for identification of human \nresource development needs.  \n(viii)  Gender-disaggregated monitoring indicators and database will be established for the project \nmanagement information system as well as for Ministry of Human Resources, Employment \nand Labor.  \n(ix)  A gender in training and employment consultant will be included in the consulting services to \ndevelop a gender action plan and to work with the Maldives Network for Employment Training.  \n \nGender plan prepared?   \nA gender in training and employment consultant will be included in the consulting services to develop a \nGender Action Plan and to work with the Maldives Network for Employment Training. \n ", "Appendix 13  59\nE.
