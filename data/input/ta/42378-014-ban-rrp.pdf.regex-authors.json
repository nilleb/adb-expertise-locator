I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) and (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by \nthe European Investment Bank (EIB), both to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the \nPower System Expansion and Efficiency Improvement Investment Program.1 \n \n2.  Inadequate  energy  security  is  one  of  the  major  stumbling  blocks  to  economic \ndevelopment in Bangladesh. The World Economic Forum already ranks Bangladesh 135th out \nof 142 countries measured against the quality and constancy of electricity supply.2 This is not \nsurprising since more than half of the country\u2019s population does not have access to electricity, \nand many of those who do have access only receive intermittent supply. During peak periods, \nup to 30% of demand is unmet (a deficit of nearly 2,000 megawatts [MW]). In 2011 and the \nsummer of 2012 there was load shedding for 5 hours a day in Dhaka city, and in other cities and \nmost  rural  areas  the  situation  is  much  worse.  Clearly,  this  situation  stunts  economic \nperformance, cuts into business competitiveness and productivity, and seriously affects the \nquality of life of people and delivery of basic public services. The government wants to arrest \nthis problem and is trying to do so through both physical investments and reforms. A first wave \nof investments and reforms was started a few years ago, and the results so far are reasonable. \nHowever, the job is far from done. A new investment and reform program is required. The \ngovernment has developed an investment program for the next 5 years (2011\u20132015). The goal \nremains  of  increasing  energy  security  through  a  combination  of  sequenced  interventions, \nincluding supply- and demand-side efficiency measures; new capital outlays in generation, \ntransmission, and distribution; investments to raise electrification rates to 68% by the end of the \nperiod; and the acceleration of reforms to improve efficiency, accountability, and effectiveness \nof sector institutions. The government wants the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to be its \npartner in this endeavor, and it is in this context that it requested financial and advisory help \nthrough the proposed MFF.3  \n \nII.   THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM  \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Sector  performance.  Sector  performance  is  low  but  there  have  been  notable \nimprovements in the last decade. Electrification rates have risen from 10% in 1994 to 50% in \n2012\u2014an  improvement  made  against  rapidly  rising  demand  of  more  than  160%  during      \n2002\u20132012.  Transmission  and  distribution  losses  have  been  cut  sharply,  mainly  due  to \ninvestment and better management. The financial performance of most sector companies has \nalso  improved  due  to higher tariffs,  better  collection,  improved financial  transparency,  and \nincreased metering. However, much remains to be done. Supplies are still irregular and the \nsystem is overreliant on natural gas. Half the population does not have access to electricity (with \nrural areas being worse off than urban areas). Load shedding remains high and there are high \nlosses  in  the  transmission  and  distribution  system.  The  financial  performance  of  some \ncompanies needs substantial improvement. Total available generation capacity is 4,890 MW but \ndemand  is  about  7,000  MW.  Power  shortages  remain  commonplace,  and  the  cost  to  the \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  World Economic Forum. 2011.

Manila. \n ", "2   \neconomy is close to 0.5% of gross domestic product.4 Moreover, the problem is set to get \nworse, with the additional supply requirement in 2015 to meet projected demand being 12,500 \nMW.  This  implies  the  need  for  major  investment  in  generation,  efficiency  measures,  and \ntransmission and distribution. \n \n4.  Policy framework. Bangladesh has a comprehensive energy policy. The 2008 National \nEnergy Policy focuses on energy security and efficiency, financial transparency, cost recovery, \nand a much greater role for the private sector. The government\u2019s Vision for 2021 provides the \nbroad context for this policy, setting universal access to electricity as a target. The Sixth Five \nYear Plan, FY2011\u2013FY2015 breaks down this strategy into specific investments and reforms \n(footnote 4). ADB and other development partners have been helping the government further \nrefine the policy and the investment frameworks. The reforms are captured under the Power \nSector Reform in Bangladesh program,5 which includes (i) setting up an independent regulatory \nbody (the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission), (ii) unbundling power sector agencies \nand  adopting  a  better  corporate  governance  framework,  (iii)  improving  the  business \nenvironment for private sector investment, and (iv) expanding rural electrification. ADB has \nextended technical assistance to help with vertical unbundling, and private sector participation \nproposals. ADB is also helping with the development of a public\u2013private partnership program \nand analytical studies on gas and power tariff changes.  \n \n5.  Road  map.  The  policy  framework  for  the  sector  is  backed  by  a  plan  to  execute \ninvestments  and  reforms  in  a  sequenced  manner.  These  investments  are  physical  and \nnonphysical, as well as private and public in nature. ADB funding to the sector so far exceeds \n$2.2 billion. An energy sector assessment program evaluation undertaken by the Independent \nEvaluation  Department  in  2009  concluded  that  ADB\u2019s  work  has  been  significant  and \nsuccessful.6 The future program  will  raise  capacity  to  12,567  MW,  with  the  private  sector \naccounting  for  more  than  half  of  this.  Table  1  provides  an  account  of  projected  sector \nrequirements. \n \nTable 1: Power Sector Investment Plan, 2012\u20132015 \nFunding Gap ($ million) \nGeneration + Transmission + \nGeneration  Transmission  Distribution  Distribution \nYear  Public  Private  (Public)  (Public)  Public  Private  Total \n2012      524     1,123    0       601     1,125     1,123        2,247  \n2013    1,216     1,138         144        601     1,961     1,138        3,099  \n2014    1,376     1,357         341        601     2,318     1,357        3,676  \n2015    1,169       640         715        601     2,485       640        3,125  \nTotal    4,286     4,258       1,201       2,402     7,889     4,258      12,147  \nSources: Asian Development Bank, Bangladesh Power Development Board, Power Grid Company of Bangladesh \nestimates. \n \n6.

It  allows  the parties  to  dedicate more  resources  to  implementation.  Second, the \nmodality supports high project readiness (such as design work and safeguard plans being \nexecuted up front) and offers critical mass, continuity, and predictability in relation to funding. \nThird, the MFF creates a platform for development partners to work with ADB in the sector, and \neach tranche has room for cofinanciers to partner with ADB. This means greater opportunities \nfor leveraging finance but also knowledge. Indeed, ADB will showcase the investment program \nto others for this purpose. Finally, all the basic preconditions for the use of the MFF are in place, \nincluding a sound policy framework and road map, a clear investment and financing plan, and \nan  agreement  on  the  treatment  of  safeguards  policies  and  procedures  and  a  governance \nframework.  The  governance  framework  will  be  underpinned  by  tight  fiduciary  oversight. \nProcurement  work  will  be  \u2015ring-fenced\u2016  through  the  use  of  specialized  and  independent \nconsultants (to support the evaluation process and contract negotiations). ADB itself will play an \nactive facilitation role in both cases. Consultants engaged to support the government with this \nwork will have a dual reporting role to ADB. Contracts will be audited on a regular basis. In \naddition to providing strong oversight, these arrangements will also improve the timelines for the \nengagement of consultants and contractors.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be increased energy sector contribution to low-carbon economic growth. \nThis  growth  will  be  achieved  through  improved  energy  efficiency,  productivity  and \ncompetitiveness, and will create more jobs. The outcome will be increased access to a clean \nand reliable supply of electricity in Bangladesh. \n \nC.  Outputs \n8.  Investments will be sequenced and cover generation, transmission, and distribution. \nUnder a pilot program, up to 200 solar-energy-supported irrigation pumps benefitting 4,000 poor \nfarming families will be installed. A capacity building input will focus on project readiness, new \ntranche preparation, and contract supervision. Staff in various institutions will also be trained on \npower system management and help given with auditing, financial management and reporting.  \n \n9.  The  investments  will  focus  on  supply-side  energy  efficiency  and  transmission  and \ndistribution, and will increase generation capacity by up to 700 MW. The program will convert \nopen cycle gas-fired power plants into combined cycle plants. This is an environmentally friendly \napproach as it will increase power supply by 50% without consuming extra gas. Under the \nprogram, up to 470 kilometers (km) of transmission lines and associated facilities will then be \nconstructed.  Finally,  there  will  be  upstream  improvements  to  the  33  kilovolt  (kV)  network \n(including up to 500 km of distribution lines and associated facilities and up to 39 new or \nupgraded 33/11 kV substations).  \n \n10.  Tranche 1 will convert the Khulna power plant (225 MW) into a combined cycle plant. \nCofinanciers  will  focus  on  converting  the  Baghabari  (150  MW),  Sylhet  (225  MW),  and \nShahjibazar (105 MW) power plants.7 Tranche 1 will also invest in the transmission system by \nconstructing three transmission lines and associated substations: (i) 100 km of 132 kV double \ncircuit  transmission  line  for  Mynmensingh\u2013Tangail,  (ii)  80  km  of  132  kV  double  circuit \ntransmission line for Chandraghona\u2013Rangamati\u2013Khagrachari, and (iii) 50 km of 132 kV double \n                                                \n7  Technical details of the power plants are provided in Technical Assessment on Tranche 1 Subprojects (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The indicated capacity is the capacity after conversion. \n ", "4   \ncircuit transmission line for Brahmanbaria\u2013Narsingdi. The rest of the funds under tranche 1 will \ncover capacity building work. The EIB will finance the Baghabari and Shahjibazar power plant \nconversions,  and  the  Islamic  Development  Bank  will  finance  the  Sylhet  plant  conversion. \nTranche  2  will  focus  on  expanding  transmission,  improving  distribution,  and  a  pilot  solar \nirrigation scheme. Tranche 3 will focus again on modernizing and converting generation plants. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n11.  The government has an ambitious investment plan for the medium-to-long term, but not \nenough funds to support it. The private sector and development partners will be the main \nfunding  sources  for  this  plan.  In  the  meantime,  and  in  the  context  of  the  shorter-term \ninvestments, the government has requested ADB and other development partners to provide a \ntotal financing of $1.6 billion (Table 2).  \n \nTable 2: Investment Program \nAmount ($ million) \nItem  Facility  Tranche 1  Tranche 2  Tranche 3 \nA.

The government has requested an MFF of up to $700 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance a part of the investment program. The MFF will consist of three \ntranches,  subject  to  the  government\u2019s  submission  of  related  periodic  financing  requests, \nexecution of the related loan and project agreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms \nand conditions and undertakings set out in the framework financing agreement. The first tranche \nof the MFF, amounting to $185 million, will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 \nyears, and an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility,8 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \n13.  The financing plan is in Table 3. The government has also requested loans from Agence \nFran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, the EIB, and the Islamic Development Bank on a parallel basis \nand not administered by ADB. The EIB will provide a grant of $7 million, which will be fully \nadministered by ADB. \n \n                                                \n8  Includes a maturity premium of 10 basis points.

The  investments  cover  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  and  as  such  will \nrequire several executing agencies: Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB); Dhaka \nPower Distribution Company (DPDC); and Dhaka Electricity Supply Company (DESCO); North-\nWest  Power  Generation  Company  Limited  (NWPGCL);  Power  Division,  Ministry  of  Power, \nEnergy, and Mineral Resources (MPEMR); Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB); Rural \nElectrification  Board  (REB).  Coordination  will  be  a  challenge  and  will  be  outsourced  to \nspecialized consultants, with ADB playing a facilitation role throughout. The investments are \nreasonably self-contained and the agencies understand ADB procedures. The Power Division at \nthe MPEMR will implement the capacity building component, the BPDB and NWPGCL will \nimplement the energy efficiency work, the PGCB will implement the transmission investments, \nthe DPDC and DESCO will implement the distribution work, and the REB will implement the \npilot  solar  irrigation  scheme.  A  project  management  unit  will  be  established  within  each \nexecuting agency. The Power Division at the MPEMR will set up a project coordination unit to \noversee all the work and report to ADB. The implementation arrangements are summarized in \nTable 4 and described in detail in the facility administration manual.9  \n \n15.  European Investment Bank requested ADB to administer $7 million grant for capacity \nbuilding component because of ADB\u2019s strong physical presence in Bangladesh and its better \nunderstanding  of  the  power  sector  capacity  building  needs.    Capacity  building  component \nundertake training activities of all the power sector agencies and it is an integral part of the \nentire investment program.  Success of the capacity building component is necessary to ensure \ndelivering the outcomes of the investment program.   Because EIB is providing the grant to be \nadministered by ADB, it is proposed to expand country eligibility for procurement or recruitment \nof consultants to be made using the EIB grant by allowing firms, subcontractors, and sourcing of \nmaterials from any country eligible under ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and EIB's procurement \nguidelines.  Such  an  expansion  of  country  and  source  eligibility  is  required  for  efficient \nimplementation of the investment program and would require a waiver under Article 14 (ix) of \nthe Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank. \n                                                \n9  Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  June 2013\u2013June 2019 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2020 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Coordinating committee: \nSecretary of the Power Division, MPEMR (chair) \nChairs of BPDB and REB; managing directors of PGCB, NWPGCL, \nDESCO, DPDC, Representatives from Economic Relations Division, Finance \nDivision, Planning Commission, and  Implementation, Monitoring and \nEvaluation Division. \n(ii)  Executing agencies  BPDB, PGCB, NWPGCL, DESCO, DPDC, REB, Power Division at \nMPEMR  \n(iii) Implementation units  Project management units in BPDB, PGCB, NWPGCL, DESCO, \nDPDC, Power Division at MPEMR \nProcurement  All works and goods to be financed by ADB under the MFF will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as \namended from time to time).a \nConsulting services  All consultancy services to be financed by ADB under the MFF will be \nselected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \nRetroactive financing and/or  Under each tranche, ADB may, subject to its policies and procedures, \nadvance contracting  allow on request advance contracting.

Goods and works financed by ADB will be procured through international competitive \nbidding in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). Project preparation, implementation, and management support will require consultants, \nwhich will be engaged in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). All consulting services, except implementation consultants, will be \nrecruited  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection,  with  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20. 10 \nConsultancy firms will be required to use in-house staff for the key tasks under the mandates \nand have a dual reporting function to ADB. Taxes and duties of ADB-funded packages will be \npaid by ADB. \n \n17.  The evaluation of bids will be carried out by government agency staff with support from \nspecialized and independent consultants. The same will apply with contract negotiations. ADB \nwill play an active facilitation role, and will engage its own consultants to help it with this work. \nThe facilitation role will cover the process, timelines, and quality.  \n \n                                                \n10 Implementation consultants will be selected using 90:10 quality\u2013cost ratio. \n ", "7 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n18.  Technical due diligence was conducted on all tranche 1 investments. The work focused \non the investment plan, operating cost structures, and the feasibility of the technology solutions. \nThe work was undertaken by independent consultants and was reviewed by ADB technical staff. \nADB is satisfied that the proposals are sound and meet appropriate technical standards.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n19.  The proposal is backed by due diligence on economic and financial matters. About \n450,000 households will directly benefit from the investments. Energy efficiency improvement \nand system loss reduction will reduce carbon emissions by 2.48 million tons per year. System \nloss reduction represents 233 gigawatt-hours in energy savings every year. This investment \nalso cuts air pollution. The economic internal rate of return of tranche 1 investments is estimated \nat  56.6%.  The  financial  internal  rates  of  return  have  been  estimated  for  the  power  plant \nconversions (4.0%) and transmission lines (4.5%), exceeding their weighted average cost of \ncapital values of 1.9% for power plant conversion and 2.1% for transmission lines. \n \nC.  Governance \n20.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the executing agencies. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, implementation of the projects under the MFF will \nadhere to ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy. ADB reserves the right to review and examine, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to \nprojects under the MFF. In this regard, investigation of government officials, if any, will be \nrequested by ADB to be undertaken by the government. To support these efforts, relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan agreement and the bidding \ndocuments. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB will include provisions specifying the \nright of ADB to  audit and examine the records and accounts  of all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  projects  under  the  MFF. \nGovernance  assessment  shows  that  reasonably  good  systems  are  in  place  but  training \nprograms will be required. As an additional measure, ADB will facilitate the work related to bid \nevaluation and contract negotiation processes of ADB-funded contract packages.11  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n21.  Poor and vulnerable consumers, as well as public utilities such as hospitals and schools, \nare often particularly disadvantaged by inadequate power supplies, load shedding, and poor \npower quality. They will therefore benefit directly from the investment program. The investment \nprogram is expected to generate jobs for skilled and unskilled labor during construction and \nbeyond. Increasing access and improving reliability of electricity will disproportionately benefit \nwomen by saving their time and allowing them to have more leisure time. Children will also \ndirectly benefit from the reliable power supply as they can extend their study hours. Tranche 1 is \nclassified  as  having  no  gender  elements  but  tranche  2  will  have  opportunities  for  gender \nmainstreaming. \n \n                                                \n11 ADB\u2019s role as a facilitator is fully described in the Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "8   \nE.  Safeguards \n22.  An environmental assessment and review framework and a resettlement framework \nwere prepared outlining the environmental and social safeguard principles and requirements. \nThe executing agencies will undertake environmental and social safeguard due diligence on \nsubprojects based on the environmental assessment and review framework and resettlement \nframework,  and  submit  semiannual  reports  on  implementation  of  the  environmental \nmanagement plan and resettlement plan for subprojects. Tranche 1 is classified category B for \nthe environment. The proposed project has no potential for significant air, water, or noise \npollution and it has positive environmental effects of reducing local air pollution and carbon \nemissions. It does not fall in the vicinity of any natural ecosystems, reserve forests, protected \nareas, and cultural sites. It has temporary minor impacts during construction that can be readily \nmitigated. An initial environmental examination and environmental management plan have been \nprepared  for  tranche  1  components  based  on  selected  representative  subproject  sites. \nTranches 2 and 3 are likely to be classified category B for environment. \n \n23.  Tranche  1  is  classified  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement.  Its  transmission \ncomponents will not require land acquisition. Construction of new transmission lines will have \nminor temporary impacts on standing crops on about 300 ha. Only a very small amount of land \n(0.3  ha)  will  be  permanently  affected.  Compensation  for  temporary  crop  damage  was \nincorporated  in  the  resettlement  plan.  No  land  acquisition  is  required  for  power  plant \nconversions. Site visits were made to all tranche 1 power plants and necessary due diligence \nwas undertaken, with 17 consultation meetings held during 8\u201328 May 2012. A total of 267 \npeople attended the meetings, 44% of whom were women. Seven separate meetings were held \nwith women and four with ethnic minorities. No major issues were raised in these meetings and \nthe communities extended their support for the project.  \n \n24.  Tranche  1  is  classified  under  indigenous  peoples  category  C.  According  to  social \nassessments, no indigenous peoples are expected to be significantly affected by the investment \nprogram. In the event of impacts on indigenous peoples, the investment program will apply the \nmitigation measures provided in the resettlement framework, which include specific measures \nthat  provide  entitlements to  vulnerable groups,  including  indigenous  peoples. Transmission \nproject construction activities are expected to be small in scale, with the possible involvement of \nlocal people in construction activities, and are not considered to pose a threat to the existing \nsociocultural  system  of  indigenous  peoples.  No  tribal  lands  will  be  acquired  or  affected. \nTranche 2 might be classified category A, and tranche 3 is likely to be classified category B for \ninvoluntary resettlement. All the safeguard documents are endorsed by the government and \ndisclosed in the ADB website.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n25.  Major risks and mitigation measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan. \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLack of gas supply for Khulna power  Government provided assurance on gas allocation for Khulna \nplant  power plant \nDelay in signing power purchase  BPDB and NWPGCL agreed to sign long-term power purchase \nagreement by BPDB and NWPGCL   agreements by June 2013. \nInadequate commitment to implement  Assurance on full implementation of safeguard measures \nenvironmental and social safeguards  included in loan documents \n ", "9 \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLimited capacity of NWPGCL in  Combined cycle power plant operation and maintenance training \noperating the Khulna combined cycle  will be provided under capacity building \npower plant \nIncrease in raw materials price  Capital expenditure estimates have been benchmarked to recent \nresulting in increase of project costs  projects in Bangladesh, and contingency funding reflects \nmovements in international prices. \nGovernment funds may not be  Assurances of timely availability of funds will be included in the \navailable on time  loan documents \nBPDB\u2019s bulk tariff rates are lower than  Assurances on tariff rationalization program included in the loan \npower purchasing costs  documents \nDelays in the acquisition of  Assurances on land acquisition included in the loan documents \ntransmission rights of way due to \nvarious social issues \nLack of financial independence of  Assurances on continuation of corporatization and financial \npower sector companies  independence included in loan documents  \nInadequate transmission and  Training on energy auditing and monitoring, power system \ndistribution loss reduction  planning, and management will be provided.  \nBPDB = Bangladesh Power Development Board, NWPGCL = North-West Power Generation Company Limited. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n26.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the investment program shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the facility administration manual and loan documents. \n \n27.  The government has given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, which are set forth in \nthe framework financing agreement. Specific covenants agreed by the Power Division, MPEMR \nand  the  EAs  with  respect  to  individual  tranches  under  the  MFF  are  set  forth  in  the  loan \nagreement and project agreement for the respective Tranches.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATIONS \n28.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount not exceeding $700,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Power \nSystem  Expansion  and  Efficiency  Improvement  Investment  Program,  from  ADB's  ordinary \ncapital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the framework financing agreement presented \nto the Board. \n \n29.
