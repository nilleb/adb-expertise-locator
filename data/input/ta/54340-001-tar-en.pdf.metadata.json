INTRODUCTION \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) project will provide support to Indian financial institutions \n(FIs) for lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for energy efficiency and smart \ninfrastructure initiatives.1 The TA activities include: (i) identifying attractive energy efficiency \nlending opportunities for FIs across various industry segments (market study); (ii) identifying \ntechnology  vendors  suitable  for  partnership  with  FIs;  (iii)  designing  financing  structures  to \nincentivize SMEs, particularly those owned by women, to finance energy efficiency initiatives;2 \nand  (iv)  sharing  knowledge  on  implementing  energy  efficiency,  smart  infrastructure,  and \nstrategies for financing emissions reduction in India. The TA will support up to two FIs in designing \nfinancing facilities (in discussion with technology vendors) for on-lending to SMEs. Following \ncompletion of this TA, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) may consider providing financing to \nIndian FIs to deploy the facilities designed by this TA project. \n \n2.  Investment in energy efficiency and smart infrastructure, particularly for machinery and \nbuildings  in  commercial  and  industrial  areas,  can  significantly  reduce  energy  costs  and \ngreenhouse gas emissions for SMEs. However, there is a low level of adoption of energy efficient \ntechnologies in India, partially due to a lack of suitable financing options for SMEs.3 ADB has \nbeen  working  to  identify  FIs  in  India  with  specialized  financial  products  or  initiatives  that \nmainstream energy efficiency and emissions reduction. Experience from development partners \nsuggests that marketing strategies, partnerships with technology firms and tailored financial \nproducts from FIs are effective in supporting financing of SME energy efficiency initiatives.  \n \n3.  The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Country Partnership Strategy for India, 2018\u20132022, which \naims to boost economic competitiveness, address climate change, and provide inclusive access \nto infrastructure.4 The strategy states that ADB will work with domestic FIs to deepen access to \nclimate finance for renewable energy development and improved energy efficiency. Promotion of \nenergy efficiency and support for smart city technologies are part of the Operational Plan for \nPrivate Sector Operations.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Energy accounts for 10%-50% of expenditures in India\u2019s core manufacturing industries, \nand electricity purchases make up the largest part of energy consumption.6 More than 20% of \nfirms in India identify electricity shortages as a major constraint to operations. Energy-efficient \nequipment reduces electricity bills, alleviates the impact of frequent power outages and enhances \n \n1  Eligible financial institutions include both banks and nonbanks regulated and supervised by the Reserve Bank of \nIndia. These initiatives refer to activities eligible for classification as climate mitigation finance in \u201c2018 Joint Report \non Multilateral Development Banks\u2019 Climate Finance,\u201d June 2019 (Annex C). These include electricity and heat \ngeneration from renewable energy; energy efficiency in existing industrial facilities and in commercial, public, and \nresidential buildings; energy efficiency improvements in utilities and public services; energy efficiency in vehicle \nfleets; energy efficiency measures in new buildings; energy audits; urban transport modal change; transport-oriented \nurban development; inter-urban transport; and infrastructure for low-carbon and efficient transport. \n2  Women-owned SMEs include SMEs where women are the primary borrower or co-borrower. \n3  S.

New Delhi. \n ", "2 \nSMEs\u2019 resilience.7 India has improved its energy efficiency since 2000, but there remains much \nroom for further improvement.  \n \n5.  Gains in energy efficiency are often encouraged by a supportive government policy \nframework. India\u2019s Perform, Achieve, and Trade scheme under the Bureau of Energy Efficiency \nis the key policy driver of efficiency gains in industry. ADB\u2019s sovereign operations support these \nefforts, most recently through a $250 million loan to a government-owned energy services \ncompany,  Energy  Efficiency  Services  Limited,  to  support  demand-side  energy  efficiency \nmeasures.8 However, private-sector financing is also needed to support adoption by SME firms. \n \n6.  Many opportunities for economically attractive efficiency gains remain untapped by SMEs \nin India, partly because of their limited awareness of available energy efficiency measures and \ntheir need for tailored financial products that enable positive returns on investment over a longer \ntime frame. A broader offering of affordable and targeted financial products will likely encourage \nSMEs to adopt new technologies for improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions.9  \n \n7.  Energy efficiency lending for SMEs is often considered less attractive than other forms of \nlending by commercial FIs in India, which often lack technical expertise, industry partnerships, \nand awareness of opportunities to design and market appropriate financing solutions. Efforts in \nother contexts to improve the capacity of FIs to lend in a targeted way for energy efficiency \nsolutions  have  yielded  successful  results.  Examples  include  the  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction  and  Development\u2019s  Sustainable  Energy  Financing  Facility,10 India\u2019s  Energy \nEfficiency Services Limited\u2019s financing company (municipal lighting with light-emitting diode light \nbulbs),11 and the emergence of green banks in developed economies (footnote 9). \n \n8.  Additional challenges lie in the lack of access to finance for women-owned micro, small, \nand medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), which accounted for only 14%-20% of MSMEs in India \nin FY2017. Access to finance is often more constrained for women-owned businesses.12 Given \nthe smaller proportion of women-owned MSMEs, public policies and programs do not explicitly \nsupport them. Almost 98% of women-owned businesses are microenterprises, and their inability \nto meet collateral requirements can make accessing finance particularly challenging.13  \n \n9.  Women entrepreneurs typically bear the burden of energy inefficiencies, especially when \nthey  are  responsible  for  cooking  and  fuel  collection,  in  addition  to  running  their  own \nmicroenterprises.  Lack of  access  to  energy for  lighting,  heating,  and  cooking  inhibits  their \n \n7  F. Zhang. 2018. In the Dark \u2013 How Much Do Power Sector Distortions Cost South Asia?

The Clean \nTechnology Fund (CTF) also contributed $46 million to this transaction. \n9 This could be even more effective when energy efficiency financing is offered in parallel with targeted information and \nexpertise on products, technologies, and other aspects key to making investment decisions.

Moreover, lack of awareness limits women's ability to capture economic opportunities \nmade possible by improved energy access. This TA will incorporate best practices on gender \nmainstreaming to mitigate structural biases against women-owned SMEs in the energy efficiency \ntechnologies industry. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: reduction of the energy intensity of the Indian \neconomy.14 The TA will have the following outcome: FIs familiarized with energy efficiency \nprogram designs suitable for SMEs in India.15. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n11.  The TA consists of three key activities which will provide ADB and potential clients with \nmarket research on target segments and technologies. In addition, the TA will help selected FIs \ndevelop suitable financing products for SMEs to invest in energy efficiency, smart infrastructure, \nand emissions-reduction measures. Where feasible, ADB will consider working with FIs to finance \nprograms developed under the TA. \n \n(i)  Phase 1: Market analysis: This study will map energy consumption and emissions by SMEs \nin various segments across India. It will provide intelligence on common energy efficiency \ntechnologies  and their  financial,  regulatory  and  practical  viability.  This  will  help  identify \npromising niches for lending programs. The study will include a review of historical data and \nprior studies to identify market needs. The study will also identify barriers (policy, technical, \nfinancial, or other) that prevent firms from investing in relevant technologies and suggest ways \nto address these barriers, including with financing products. To the extent possible, the study \nwill highlight the share and profile of women-owned or women-led businesses in segments \nwhere energy efficiency technologies are most relevant, and identify constraints they face in \naccessing technologies or managing the supplier dynamic that differentiate them from male-\nled businesses. The study will be published as an ADB knowledge product to inform phases \n2 and 3 and support market-building activities in energy efficiency and smart infrastructure.  \n(ii) Phase 2: Industry engagement: ADB will present the market study to FIs, private sector \npartners, technology providers, and other key stakeholders at a gender-inclusive event in an \nIndian business or industry hub. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Financial Institutions Division (PSFI) \nwill provide information on working with FIs to finance targeted high-impact technologies. ADB \nwill identify suitable and gender-inclusive FIs committed to developing a targeted SME lending \nprogram for energy efficiency. ADB will also identify energy efficiency equipment and service \nvendors interested in establishing partnerships with ADB-supported financial institutions. \n(iii) Phase 3: Capacity building and project pipeline development: Following the workshop, \nconsultants funded under this TA will work with the selected FIs to design a targeted SME \nlending program. The design will include a plan to develop or procure expertise to assess \ntechnologies and identify potential technology partners; design financial products that take the \nwomen borrower\u2019s market into consideration; work with male and female equipment and \nservice  vendors;  create  associated  credit  and  distribution  criteria;  develop  a  marketing \nstrategy targeting both male and female customers; train loan officers to service diverse \nmarkets, develop gender-inclusive hiring and training strategies; and develop a commercial \npipeline for the new SME financing products. The identification of technology partners and \ndesign of partnership incentives will be a critical part of this phase. \n \n14 The Energy Conservation Act, established in 2001 is the legal framework for promoting energy conservation in India.  \n15 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.   \n ", "4 \n \nThe resulting outputs from the TA activities are identified in the Development Metrics Framework \n(DMF) (Appendix 1): (i) FIs\u2019 knowledge of energy efficiency credit lines improved, (ii) market gaps \nanalyzed, and (iii) SMEs\u2019 knowledge of gender-sensitive energy-efficient technologies improved.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $400,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the Clean \nTechnology Fund and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB\u2019s  PSOD  (Financial  Institutions  division)  will  administer  the  TA  and  will  select, \nsupervise, and evaluate consultants. ADB will disburse the TA funds following ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). ADB will contract a \nfirm through quality- and cost-based selection or quality based selection to conduct the market \nstudy and prepare materials for the workshop (phases 1 and 2) through an output-based lump \nsum contract with a provision for fixed out-of-pocket expenditures.  \n \n14.  Phase 1 and phase 2 are expected to be carried out under separate contracts. For phase \n3, ADB will work with a consultant or a firm to prepare the lending program in collaboration with \nthe selected FI(s) and technology partners.16 This work will be separately procured once the \nparticipating FI(s) have been identified and is subject to a TA agreement being signed with the \npartnering FI(s). The FI(s) selected to participate in phase 3 will contribute resources to the \nsuccessful completion of the product launch strategy that results in a capital commitment from \nADB. Terms will be agreed through a TA agreement letter.17  \n \n15.  ADB staff will supervise and work with the consultants and the identified FI(s) to ensure \nthat the work is targeted at developing a viable lending program suitable for potential financing by \nADB. Successful completion of the TA will allow the identified partner FIs and PSFI to prepare a \npotential  lending  program  and  to  consider  conducting  project-specific  due  diligence.  This \napproach is consistent with the scope for a KSTA activity, as it involves sector and thematic \nresearch and development to search for potential ADB financing transactions. The direct costs of \nworking with the FI on development of a specific project (phase 3) can be recovered from the FI \nif ADB makes a capital commitment for the project.  \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative  December 2020\u2013June 2023 \nimplementation period \nExecuting agency  ADB\u2014Private Sector Operations Department \nConsultants  Package title  Selection method  Engaged \nby \n  Phase 1 and 2  Individual consultant or firm:   \nGender-sensitive market gap analysis for  QCBS/QBS   \nenergy efficiency and emissions- ADB \nreduction measures for SMEs in India \n(includes workshop planning and \ncoordination; and report editing, design, \nand layout) \n \n16 The terms of reference for phase 3 will take into account the specific needs of the selected partner FI. \n17 Sample TA Letter Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3).   \n ", "5 \nAspects  Arrangements \n  Phase 3 (Conditional)  Individual consultant or firm:   \nSmart building and energy efficiency  QCBS/QBS.
