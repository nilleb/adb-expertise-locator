THE ONGOING PROJECT \n \n1.  Since 2012, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has engaged with the Government of \nMyanmar to help formulate and implement education reforms, particularly in secondary education \nand  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training  (TVET).  The  Equipping  Youth  for \nEmployment  Project  (EYE)\u2014the  first  ADB  loan  for  Myanmar\u2019s  education  sector\u2014aims  to \nstrengthen the country\u2019s education and skills base and promote inclusive growth and job creation.1 \nThe EYE supports reforms to realign secondary education and TVET to Myanmar\u2019s evolving \nworkforce needs. These reforms are vital to equip youth with skills for employment in a modern \neconomy and meet employers\u2019 skill demands. The project\u2019s impact will be education and skills \nbase for inclusive growth enhanced, and its outcome will be secondary education subsector and \nTVET realigned to evolving labor force needs and equitably expanded. The EYE has three outputs: \n(i) policy frameworks and capacities for cohesive, workforce-responsive secondary education \nsubsector and TVET enhanced; (ii) new secondary education subsector curriculum delivered and \naccess expanded; and (iii) new TVET programs introduced and access expanded. The project\u2019s \ntotal cost is $105.0 million, with $98.5 million financed by a loan from ADB.2  \n \n2.  ADB and the European Union (EU) have been closely collaborating with the Ministry of \nEducation (MOE) and other development partners to design and implement education reforms, \nfocusing strategically on secondary education and TVET.3 In 2019, the EU and the Government \nof Myanmar signed the financing agreement for  Education Sector Reform Contract with grant \nfinancing of up to \u20ac221 million, including budget support of \u20ac175 million for secondary education \nand  TVET  reforms  and  complementary  measures. 4  The  proposed  transaction  technical \nassistance (TA) will support a subset of the complementary measures. Enhancing ongoing ADB \n(EYE) and EU support, the EU will finance the proposed TA in the amount of \u20ac24 million ($26.0 \nmillion equivalent) and ADB will administer it. The TA will support continued reforms to better align \nsecondary education and TVET to Myanmar\u2019s evolving skill demands. The TA aligns with ADB\u2019s \nMyanmar country partnership strategy, 2017-2021, that focuses on strengthening human capital \nto  promote  a  skilled  workforce  and  increased  employment,  and  enable  the  poor  and \ndisadvantaged to benefit from economic growth.5 It also aligns with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and will \nhelp address remaining poverty and reducing inequalities by improving education and training \n(operational priority 1) and accelerate progress in gender equality (operational priority 2).6  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Weak human capital poses a critical obstacle to Myanmar\u2019s development, threatening to \ntrap the economy in a low value-added model based on cheap, unskilled labor and natural \n \n1  ADB. Myanmar: Equipping Youth for Employment Project.  \n2  As of 30 September 2019, cumulative contract awards reached $20.9 and disbursements reached $13.3 million. The \nproject is rated an actual problem as of September 2019 because of startup delays. Implementation progress has \nimproved, and thus project rating is expected to improve in 2020 after the midterm review. \n3  Development partner support for education in Myanmar is concentrated in primary education, while ADB and EU \nprovide the main international support for secondary education and TVET.   \n4  European Commission.

Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n \n ", "2 \nresource exploitation, while obstructing national poverty reduction and inclusive growth goals.7 \nMany young entrants to the workforce lack skills needed for employment in a modern economy.8 \nEmployers consistently cite weak human capital as a leading constraint on business.9 Secondary \neducation and TVET are central to this human capital challenge. Secondary education supplies \nthe largest share (50%) of entrants into nonagricultural formal wage labor. However, outdated \ncurricula  and  rote-based  teaching  and  learning  approaches  mean  that  school-leavers  lack \nfoundation skills (e.g., literacy and numeracy) and soft skills (e.g., critical thinking, problem-solving, \ncreativity, and communication skills). Likewise, TVET has struggled to equip youth with vocation-\nspecific hard skills (e.g., construction or mechanical skills) and with entrepreneurship and other \nbusiness-related  skills. To  address  these  challenges, the MOE  initiated  reforms  under  the \nNational Education Strategic Plan, 2016\u20132021 to realign secondary education and TVET to meet \nevolving labor market skill needs. However, reversing decades of underinvestment will require \nsustained support. ADB and the EU are committed to support sequenced reforms under the \ncurrent National Education Strategic Plan and any subsequent national plans.  \n \n4.  The EYE is providing introduction training of the new curriculum which will not be sufficient \nfor teachers to change their teaching and learning practice. It is supporting the introduction of \ncompetency-based modular short courses at selected public TVET schools which require further \nexpansion to meet demands from industry. Building on key initial reforms supported by EYE and \ncomplementing the budget support provided by the EU (para 2), the proposed TA will support the \nMOE in advancing critical follow-on reforms. First, it will strengthen MOE capacity to formulate \nand implement cohesive and evidence-based reforms to align skill supply with evolving skill \ndemand. Second, as part of a multipronged approach to improve teaching and learning, the TA \nwill support the MOE to formulate and introduce (i) a continuing professional development (CPD) \nsystem  for  in-service  secondary  education teachers  and  (ii)  updated pre-service  education \nprograms to prepare future high school teachers to deliver the new curriculum. This will enhance \nthe MOE\u2019s overhaul of the secondary education curriculum (including textbooks and teacher \nguides) and annual rounds of in-service training of teachers to deliver the improved curriculum \nsupported under EYE.10 Third, the TA will provide follow-on support to the MOE to (i) reform \ncurricula of longer-term TVET programs at upper secondary and post-secondary levels; and (ii) \nstrengthen MOE cooperation with nongovernment organizations and industries to diversify TVET \nprovision, including targeting females and ethnic group youth. The TA will also feed into a potential \nsecond phase of EYE.11  \n \n \n7  S. D\u2019Amico, C. Spohr, and S. Tanaka. 2015. Myanmar Human Capital Development, Employment, and Labor \nMarkets. ADB Economics Working Paper Series. No. 469. Manila: ADB.   \n8   Females are particularly likely to be trapped in vulnerable employment: 53% of working females age 20\u201329 are own \naccount or contributing family workers, versus 47% for their male counterparts. \n9  Myanmar\u2019s Private Sector Development Framework and Action Plan identifies human capital as a core priority: \nhttp://www.dica.gov.mm/sites/dica.gov.mm/files/document-files/psd_framework_final_01_apr_englidh.pdf.   \n10  In May 2019, EYE provided 14 days of in-service teacher training to support introduction of the new grade 6 \ncurriculum, with further annual rounds planned for 2020\u20132022 to support introduction of the new curriculum for grades \n7 to 12.  \n11  The proposed provision of a transaction technical assistance (TA) after the approval of EYE reflects (i) signing of the \nfinancing agreement of EU\u2019s assistance program with the Government of Myanmar in February 2019 (para. 2), (ii) \nthe technical nature of support, and (iii) EU preference for the TA modality in lieu of project grant modality, which \nwould require administration by the MOE. \n \n ", "3 \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n5.  The  TA  will  have  three  outputs,  as  outlined  below  and  elaborated  in  the  terms  of \nreference.12 \n \n6.  Output 1: Evidence-based post-primary education reforms effectively supported, \nmonitored, and disseminated. The TA will provide cohesive and crosscutting umbrella support \nfor post-primary education (focusing on secondary education and TVET) to align with evolving \nlabor market demands for foundation skills, soft skills, and technical and vocational skills. In \nparticular,  it  will  support  (i)  analysis,  evidence-based  planning,  and  crosscutting  capacity \ndevelopment,  focusing  on  post-primary  education  reform,  and  (ii)  TA-wide  coordination, \nmonitoring and evaluation, gender actions, and communication.   \n \n7.  Analytical and evidence-based planning and capacity development. First, the TA will \nsupport  the  MOE  to  consolidate  and  analyze  data  from  various  sources  (including  via \ncollaboration with the Ministry of Labour, Immigration, and Population) on skill supply and evolving \nskill  demands,  including  disaggregation  by  gender,  geographic  areas,  and  other  social \ndimensions.13 It will develop bilingual (Myanmar language and English) knowledge products \ndistilling national and international analysis and experience. Second, the TA will help the MOE \ntranslate national analysis and international experience into the national education plan\u2019s next \nphase (2021\u20132026) and longer-term skills development strategies for Myanmar to  improve \nregional and global competitiveness. It will support Myanmar\u2019s hosting of and participation in \ninternational forums to bring insights from global practices to Myanmar\u2019s key reforms. Third, the \nTA will support MOE capacities in engaging stakeholders at central to grassroot levels (e.g., local \ngovernments, the private sector, civil society groups working with female and ethnic group youth, \nand  private  education  and  training  providers)  in  reform-related  dialogue.  It  will  enhance \ncoordination mechanisms, including the government\u2013industry Working Committee on Human \nCapital,  and  effective  use  of  affordable  digital  technology,  information,  education,  and \ncommunication tools for dissemination and social marketing of key reforms.14  \n \n8.  Support  for  TA-wide  coordination,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  gender  actions, \ncommunication,  and  administration.  The  TA  will  help  ensure  strong  ownership  and \ncoordination across all outputs with relevant departments of the MOE. It will also support \nmonitoring and evaluation across all initiatives (including disaggregation by sex, ethnic group, and \nother dimensions), gender actions, communication plan implementation, other crosscutting work, \nand the TA-financed procurement of goods (e.g., learning materials and minor equipment).  \n \n9.  Output 2: New secondary education continuing professional development system \nand pre-service teacher education program introduced. The TA will support the introduction \nof two critical reforms to improve teaching and learning outcomes in secondary education: (i) a \n \n12 The terms of reference for consultants are accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. EYE\u2019s design \nand monitoring framework will be updated upon approval of the proposed TA during the midterm review of EYE, to \nreflect the key activities of the TA. The updated design and monitoring framework will be included in the project \nadministration manual.  \n13  Such data sources include the MOE\u2019s Education Management Information System, the November 2019 Intercensal \nSurvey, and the periodic Labor Force Survey. The TA will build on initial ADB-supported geographic information \nsystem mapping of school networks and employment patterns.  \n14 The Working Committee on Human Capital was established to support implementation of the human capital pillar of \nthe Private Sector Development Framework and Action Plan (footnote 7) and is chaired by the MOE Deputy Minister. \nThe TA may also support the proposed TVET Council (expected to be established by 2021) in promoting TVET-\nfocused coordination.  \n \n ", "4 \nschool-based CPD system and (ii) upgraded pre-service education programs for future high \nschool teachers. The TA will enhance EYE-supported introduction of new textbooks, teacher \nguides, and annual teacher training rounds, and will build on EU support for school-based CPD \nmodule development.  \n \n10.  Continuous professional development for in-service secondary education teachers. \nThe TA will build on the ongoing EYE and EU support to introduce basic CPD activities for middle \nschool teachers linked to the rollout of the revised grade 6 curriculum in school year (SY) 2019/20. \nFirst, it will support capacity building at the central to school level to manage and deliver CPD \nlinked to the remainder of curriculum reforms, including extending high school through grade 12 \nin SY2022/23.15 Second, it will support digital technology and media-based materials to support \nCPD, which will be sensitive to gender and  ethnic group. Third, the TA will support development \nand institutionalization of a national CPD system to provide continued local and in-school support \nto teachers after the completion of ongoing curriculum reforms in SY2022/23. CPD programs will \nensure equitable access to female and ethnic group teachers. \n \n11.  Upgraded pre-service teacher education for future high school teachers. First, the \nTA will help the MOE revise the curriculum for Bachelor of Education programs for future high \nschool teachers to align with the forthcoming 3-year (grades 10\u201312) high school curriculum.16 \nNew curricula will be sensitive to gender and ethnic group. Second, the TA will enhance the \nprofessional skills and competencies of teacher educators at the three universities offering the \nBachelor of Education programs.17 Third, the TA will strengthen the Bachelor of Education \nprograms\u2019 management and quality assurance. The TA will help these three universities to forge \ntwinning arrangements with international teacher education institutions to establish long-term \npartnerships to strengthen research capacity and teacher education management.  \n \n12.  Output 3: Technical vocational education and training programs diversified and \nbetter  aligned  with  evolving  labor  market  demands.  The  TA  will  support  the  MOE  in \naccelerating reforms to improve TVET quality and relevance; diversify TVET offerings; and \nexpand TVET access, including for female students, disadvantaged youth, and underserved \nareas. Enhancing EYE and EU support, the TA will support longer-term TVET program reforms \nand new partnerships in TVET provision.  \n \n13.  Development  of  revised  curricula  for  government  technical  high  schools  and \ngovernment technical institutes. The TA will support MOE\u2019s introduction of new curricula for \ngovernment technical high schools and government technical institutes to better align with skill \ndemands from industries. This includes capacity development of trainers in partnerships with \nindustry, and procurement of the required materials and equipment to support preparation and \ninitial roll-out of the revised TVET curricula. Social marketing will aim to attract more females into \nTVET, especially to nontraditional skill areas (e.g., manufacturing and electrical works). The TA \nwill help the MOE to develop a strategic plan on infrastructure, equipment, and materials for the \nrevised TVET programs, to be financed by government budget and/or international support.  \n \n14.  Expansion of technical vocational education and training partnerships. The TA will \nhelp the MOE expand strategic partnerships with international nongovernment organizations \n \n15 Following the MOE\u2019s introduction of a new kindergarten year in SY2016/17, the extension of high school (upper \nsecondary) through grade 12 (supported by EYE) in SY2022/23 will bring Myanmar up to international norm of a \nkindergarten\u201312 system.   \n16 These include a 5-year program for high school graduates and a 2-year program to upgrade middle school teachers. \n17 These are Yangon University of Education, Sagaing University of Education, and University of Development of \nNational Races. \n ", "5 \n(INGOs) and the private sector to diversify short-term TVET programs to include additional skill \nareas and reach more youth and workers, including females and males in underserved areas \n(including areas with large ethnic group populations). First, the TA will help the MOE collaborate \nwith INGOs and local partners to extend TVET short courses, through harmonizing approaches, \nensuring quality control, and facilitating issuance of completion certificates by the MOE. The TA \nwill support competitive tendering of INGOs to provide short courses in selected high priority skill \nand geographic areas to open more room for INGOs to operate effectively in Myanmar\u2019s TVET \nsector.18 Second, in coordination with the government\u2013industry Working Committee on Human \nCapital, the TA will support the MOE to expand MOE\u2013industry collaboration in reskilling and \nupskilling  youth  and  existing  workers.  This  will  include  support  to  (i)  develop  operational \nguidelines for training organized jointly by public TVET schools and private sector entities, and (ii) \npilot a training partnership fund to cover eligible costs for the training. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $26.1 million, of which $26.0 million (not exceeding \u20ac24.0 \nmillion) will be financed on a grant basis by the EU and administered by ADB. The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 1. Indicatively, output 1 is estimated to cost $5.1 million, output 2 is \nestimated  at  $7.3  million,  and  output  3  is  estimated  at  $10.7  million.  In  addition,  ADB \nadministration cost, contingencies, and audit cost are estimated at $2.9 million. The Government \nof Myanmar will provide the balance in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation for \nselected consultants, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \n16.  The EU grant will finance the TA activities and outputs, including operational expenses, in \nthe form of consulting services, trainings, workshops, conferences, modest goods procurement \nsuch as to support preparation and initial roll out of revised TVET curricula, as well as audit and \nadministration costs.19 The TA will not be used for civil works.    \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will administer the TA. The Human and Social Development Division, Southeast Asia \nDepartment  will  select,  supervise,  and  evaluate  TA-financed  consultants,  and  will  monitor \nprocurement of goods by the TA-financed consultants. The MOE will be the executing agency \nand the MOE Executive Committee will provide oversight with the relevant focal departments. \n \n18.

Following competitive \ntendering for the first phase, ADB may consider single-source selection for a second phase, contingent on \nsatisfactory INGO performance in order to ensure uniformity in the extended service provision. \n19 The EU requires submission of an audit report of the TA transactions by the ADB external auditor every two years.  \n ", "6 \nAspects  Arrangements \nFirms: Quality- and cost-based  For all three outputs  $20.0 million \nselection (90:10) \nIndividual consultants (7)   108 person-months  $2.3 million  \n(estimated) \nDirect contracting- Audit firm  1 contract  $0.1 million \nINGOs     $0.5 million \nProcurement of goods  To be procured by TA-financed consultants  \nOpen competitive bidding,  Contracts will be  $2.0 million \nnational advertisements  determined based  included in TA \non needs during  firms\u2019 contracts \nimplementation.  as a provisional \nsum \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAsset turnover or  TA-financed equipment will be dedicated to TA use and turned over to the \ndisposal arrangement  Ministry of Education or an agency it may specify after TA completion.  \nupon TA completion \nADB = Asian Development Bank; INGO = international nongovernmental organization; TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.   \n \n19.  Consulting services. ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated staff instructions.20 ADB will \nengage the consulting services principally through firms. In addition, several individual consultants \nwill be mobilized, including one program manager (TA team leader) and some key consultants for \nearly startup. ADB will engage INGOs following procedures of procurement of non-consulting \nservices to implement competency-based short courses under output 3. \n \n20.  Procurement. The TA-financed consulting firms will procure goods and services, in \ndialogue with ADB and the MOE and in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time) and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as \namended from time to time). \n \n21.  The delegation agreement with EU stipulates that consultants and entities from all 28 \nmembers of the EU are eligible for contracts financed by the EU.21 To meet the requirement, an \nexception pursuant to Article 14 (ix) of the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank \n(the Charter) is requested to allow universal procurement for all prospective contracts under the \nTA. 22 \n \n22.
