INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Southeast Asia is one of the world\u2019s most dynamic regions. Driven by strong growth, \nmany of the region\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs) are entering middle-income status \n(i.e., Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand). Other Southeast Asian DMCs are also \nexperiencing robust growth rates (i.e., Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and \nMyanmar).1 The region\u2019s development and integration are expected to gain momentum with the \nrealization of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Economic Community by the \nend of 2015, further fueling the region\u2019s growth, competitiveness, and integration within the \nglobal economy.2 In the face of growing needs, DMCs and subregional entities are increasingly \nturning  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  knowledge  solutions.  Despite  ADB\u2019s \nincreasing support, it is recognized that the region\u2019s DMCs need more responsive knowledge \nsolutions.  As  a  result,  five  of  the  seven  Southeast  Asian  DMCs  prepared  their  country \nknowledge plans (CKPs) as part of, or in parallel with, their country partnership strategies \n(CPSs)  or  country  operations  business  plans.3 During  CKP  preparations,  ADB  received \nrequests from various DMCs for further knowledge support. \n \n2.  As the region experiences momentum for development, the knowledge requirements of \nSoutheast Asian DMCs and subregional entities are becoming more complex.4 Quick access to \nin-depth knowledge products and services is needed to formulate policies and provide solutions \nto emerging issues, including some knowledge services that cannot be anticipated in advance. \nIndeed, ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 (the midterm review) states that for the region \nto achieve the next stage of development, DMCs need to improve the quality of their economic \npolicies, strengthen governance and capacities, and successfully transform the structure of their \neconomies more towards manufacturing and high-value services.5 It is recognized that this \ntransition will require knowledge-based approaches. Accordingly, this technical assistance (TA) \nis based on the knowledge requirements of Southeast Asian DMCs and their requests to ADB \nfor enhanced knowledge support and solutions. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  In recognition of these evolving needs, the midterm review calls for ADB to provide \nSoutheast  Asian  DMCs  with  faster,  better-coordinated,  and  more  operationally  relevant \nknowledge  support,  which  includes  (i)  enhancing  internal  coordination  of  knowledge \nmanagement approaches; (ii) capturing knowledge embedded in investment operations; (iii) \nincreasing resources for knowledge activities; and (iv) more effectively using information and \n                                                \n1  Differences in the development levels of countries within the Southeast Asia region result in varying scope and \nrequirements of knowledge support. This is one of the main reasons each country partnership strategy (CPS) in the \nregion requires country-tailored knowledge plans to be developed. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) past \nknowledge support for Southeast Asia is summarized in ADB. 2012. Knowledge First: Progressing Knowledge \nManagement in the Southeast Asia Department, 2010\u20132011. Manila. \n2  Economic integration in Southeast Asia is also facilitating integration with neighboring economies. For example, the \nASEAN\u2013China Free Trade Area (2010) is the largest free trade area in terms of population, and the third largest in \nterms of nominal gross domestic product. ASEAN\u2013China trade reached 43% of intra-ASEAN trade in 2009. \n3  The Myanmar CKP is expected to be completed in 2015, and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic CKP in 2016. \n4 The term \u201csubregional entities\u201d refers to subregional cooperation initiatives such as the Brunei Darussalam\u2013\nIndonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines-East ASEAN Growth Area, Greater Mekong Subregion, and Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013\nThailand-Growth Triangle. When graduated member countries are involved in technical assistance (TA) activities, \ntheir costs will be on a reimbursable basis. \n5  ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n6  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 June 2015. The TA concept \nclearance was obtained on 24 August 2015. \n ", "2   \ncommunication technology for storage, retrieval, and dissemination of knowledge products and \ndata. Although ADB has been providing knowledge support to Southeast Asian DMCs and \nsubregional entities for many years, there is a continuous need to (i) provide faster and more \noperationally  relevant  knowledge  support;  (ii)  ensure  a  readily  available  resource  pool  to \nrespond to the countries\u2019 requests; and (iii) enhance coordination among the sector divisions, \nresident missions, and knowledge departments in formulating knowledge products and services. \n \n4.  The proposed TA will improve the timely and coordinated delivery of knowledge services \nand policy advice to Southeast Asian DMCs and subregional entities to promote inclusive and \nsustainable growth, as well as to increase ADB\u2019s operational efficiency, relevance and policy \nimpact. To facilitate quick and effective responses to knowledge requirements of DMCs and \nsubregional entities, the TA will be structured as a facility TA. ADB first developed the facility TA \nmodality in partnership with the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China to serve as a \nflexible, quick-response mechanism for funding multiple subprojects under a single TA.7 ADB\u2019s \nIndependent Evaluation Department prepared a Corporate Evaluation Study on the Role of \nTechnical Assistance in ADB Operations which recommended exploring options to expand the \nfacility TA concept, noting that facility TA projects with clear implementation designs and criteria \nhave had a substantial impact on policy analysis, and have consistently been rated successful.8 \n \n5.  Using  this  facility  TA  modality  will  better  enable  ADB  to  provide  timely  knowledge \nsupport, particularly for policy advice pursuant to emerging DMC and subregional demands. It \nwill improve responsiveness, while reducing administrative costs of processing individual TA \nprojects. Knowledge needs are dynamic, and cannot be fully predicted. Streamlined approval \nprocedures will also allow for more flexibility and swiftness in addressing urgent knowledge \nneeds. This method is consistent with ADB\u2019s Finance++ approach to client relationships, as \nreflected in ADB\u2019s strategies, policies, and action plans.9 \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact will be enhanced growth, competitiveness, and integration of Southeast Asia \nwithin the global economy. The outcome will be the adoption and application of knowledge \nsolutions  for  improved  policies,  regulations,  and  capacities  in  Southeast  Asian  DMCs  and \nsubregional entities through: (i) DMC officials using knowledge solutions as envisioned in the \nmidterm review and CKPs via the facility TA approach; and (ii) ADB (sector divisions and \nresident missions) and relevant agencies engaging in policy dialogue (as relevant for ADB \n                                                \n7\n  These facility TA projects are (i) ADB. 2003.

The outputs will be (i) the development of knowledge products for Southeast Asian \nDMCs or subregional entities and (ii) the conduct of dissemination activities related to the \nknowledge products and support. The key areas identified by the midterm review represent the \noverall priority framework for the subprograms to be supported by the TA, so that activities are \nfocused and prioritized based on operational relevance. These areas include: \n(i)  Poverty  reduction  and  inclusive  economic  growth. Strengthening country \nfocus,  building  closer  operational  and  sector  links  with  the  inclusive  growth \nagenda, improving the enabling environment, and more effectively monitoring \nand measuring results. \n(ii)  Environment  and  climate  change.  Providing  greater  support  to  DMCs  to \nreduce  their  vulnerabilities  arising from  environmental  degradation  and  rising \nlevels of water and air pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions, and to \nenhance their resilience to climate change and natural hazards.  \n(iii)  Regional cooperation and integration. Accelerating economic growth, raising \nproductivity and employment, reducing economic disparities and vulnerabilities, \nand achieving closer policy coordination in support of regional and global public \ngoods. \n(iv)  Infrastructure development. Building resilience to economic and environmental \nvulnerabilities, and maintaining ADB\u2019s comparative advantage in infrastructure \ndevelopment. \n \n8.  The TA will be based on the CKPs prepared by ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department \n(SERD) and the CPSs. The CKPs have been prepared in consultation with DMCs based on \ntheir stated requirements, and they emphasize knowledge (particularly for policy advice) as an \nintegral component for implementing country development strategies. The resident missions, \nalong with the sector divisions and other knowledge departments, are the focal points for CKP \nimplementation. A key operating principle is that all knowledge content reflected in the CPS \nlending and nonlending program is based on country needs and demands, stemming from \ncountry, sector, and thematic analyses, strategies and road maps, and related dialogue. The \nSoutheast Asian DMCs with CKPs include Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and \nViet Nam. CKP preparation for the remaining DMCs is in process. The regional work will also be \nconsistent with regional operations and business plans, as well as other guiding documents. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Accordingly, the TA\u2019s main framework and purpose is to provide knowledge support to \nSoutheast  Asian  DMCs  on  priorities  outlined  in  the  midterm  review  and  CKPs.  Potential \nsubprojects that can be supported by the TA, based on the framework outlined in paragraph 7, \ninclude (i) knowledge support for regional transport and trade facilitation, infrastructure financing, \nand  subregional  programs  (Regional  Cooperation  and  Operations  Coordination  Division \n[SERC]); (ii) knowledge work to support studies in new transportation areas, including railways \n(Transport and Communications Division); (iii) knowledge work to support cross-border power-\nsharing  and  regional  power  grid  development  (Energy  Division);  and  (iv)  country-level \ndiagnostics  reviews  on  economic  growth  and  identification  of  policy  implications  (Public \nManagement, Financial Sector, and Trade Division). Other SERD sector divisions have also \nindicated the need for knowledge work in their respective areas. SERC will guide knowledge \nefforts at the regional level, which may draw upon knowledge gained from other subregions. \n \n ", "4   \n10.  For new requests for knowledge subprojects, the facility TA modality includes a flexible \nmechanism to undertake strategic interventions in a timely manner. The mechanism allows for \nthe selection and endorsement of new subprojects to meet the dynamic demands of Southeast \nAsian DMCs and subregional entities to respond to emerging development issues through high-\nquality  research,  knowledge  guidance,  and  policy  advice.  Accordingly,  there  is  no  pre-\nearmarking of the TA resources; rather, support will be determined based on the strategic \nrequirements of, and benefits to, DMCs, as well as relevance to ADB\u2019s key operations, as \nindicated in the midterm review, CKPs, and sector- and thematic-level operational priorities.10 \nThis support could include knowledge work that not only complements ongoing operations, but \nalso the scaling up of future ADB operations. \n \n11.  Recognizing that knowledge dissemination is as important as knowledge generation, the \nTA design also provides for dissemination activities (such as workshops, seminars, and other \nrelated activities, as appropriate) that can also contribute to better country- and sector-level \nknowledge management (i.e., depository, retrieval, and disclosure of TA outputs to complement \nthe \u201ck-Nexus\u201d and \u201ck-Portal,\u201d as well as other knowledge tools developed by ADB). The TA\u2019s \nsubprojects will also require detailed dissemination plans, as appropriate. In addition, at the \ncountry and sector levels, the TA will provide opportunities for ADB to build partnerships with \nlocal and regional knowledge and research institutes. \n \n12.  Activities that will not be eligible for TA support, as other mechanisms exist to provide for \nsuch needs, include (i) direct project preparations (i.e., project preparatory activities, although \nthe TA can provide supplementary knowledge support as appropriate); (ii) direct preparation of \nADB country strategy or operation business plan-related documents (although inputs can be \nprovided as appropriate); and (iii) project completion reports. \n \n13.  As noted above, ADB will be the TA executing agency, and SERD\u2019s SERC will manage \nimplementation. Other SERD sector divisions, as well as ADB knowledge departments, SERD \nresident missions, and ADB communities of practice, will provide additional support. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented from November 2015 to November 2018. The TA will \nrequire an estimated 40 person-months of international consulting services and 40 person-\nmonths of national consulting services. Based on the knowledge product to be developed or \nservice to be provided, either firms or individual consultants can be recruited, following ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline terms \nof reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n16.  To facilitate staff coordination, a team of SERD staff members will form a working group \nto implement the TA and support the DMCs with relevant knowledge work. Each SERD sector \ndivision and resident mission or country office will nominate one international staff member as a \n                                                \n10 Many thematic priorities, such as integrating gender dimensions where relevant, will be based on each TA \nsubproject\u2019s design. \n ", "  5 \nfocal person for knowledge programs (para. 9). In addition, ADB\u2019s knowledge departments and \nsector and thematic groups may also be involved in designing and implementing knowledge \ndevelopment programs as requested by DMCs. Detailed TA implementation procedures among \nsector  divisions  and  resident  missions,  in  coordination  with  SERC,  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n \n17.  Specific terms of reference for each subproject will be developed and endorsed by the \nrelevant ADB sector division or resident mission director, in consultation with ADB\u2019s Operations \nServices and Financial Management Department, as appropriate. The relevant sector division or \nresident mission will also coordinate and administer consultant contracts. Per given subproject, \nthe TA can use output-based, lump sum contracts. If many consultants are required, the TA can \nrecruit consulting firms. Prioritization of knowledge programs will be based on consultations with \nparticipating countries. As possible, the TA will also coordinate with relevant ASEAN working \ngroups and other subregional bodies. TA activities will be largely guided by ADB\u2019s midterm \nreview, CPS, CKPs, and regional and national operational priorities. A summary of CKPs in \nSoutheast Asia is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n18.  Through SERC, ADB will supervise TA performance, evaluate outputs at each milestone, \nand prepare a completion report. From SERC, two international staff members, one national \nofficer,  and  one  operations  assistant  will  review  and  consolidate  consultants'  outputs.  To \npromote  quality  administration,  SERC  (led  by  the  director)  will  also  develop  internal \narrangements for subproject processing and approval within SERD. Specifically, a template will \nrequire  the  rationale,  description,  expected  outcome,  and  core  outputs  for  each  proposed \nsubproject to be defined. This will facilitate the review of proposals and help enhance subproject \ndesign.  Finally,  in  supporting  knowledge  services,  the  TA  will  maximize  the  use  of  ADB \nexpertise  whenever  available.  TA  disbursements  will  follow  ADB's  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). 11 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor Knowledge Development Support for Southeast Asia, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n                                                \n11 As this TA is primarily intended for policy advisory support, equipment purchases are not required. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact of the Technical Assistance Project is Aligned with \nEnhanced growth, competitiveness, and integration of Southeast Asia within the global economy.a \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nAdoption and  a.
