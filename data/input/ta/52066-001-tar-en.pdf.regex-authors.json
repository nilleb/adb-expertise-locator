INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will fund a feasibility study to further \ndevelop the concept and articulate the business case for establishing a multilateral trade credit \nand investment (re-) guarantee agency (TCIGA). The proposed TCIGA would assist in promoting \nforeign direct investment (FDI) and sustainable economic growth in the Central and West Asia \n(CWA), East Asia, and South Asia subregions through intra-regional and interregional trade. \n  \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) presented the proposed TCIGA draft concept at the \n24th Trade Policy Coordinating Committee Meeting of the Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) Program in Tbilisi, Georgia, in June 2017.1 The prospective member \ncountries at the meeting responded positively that the initial processing of the TA for ADB\u2019s 10 \nCWA developing member countries (DMCs) was triggered. \n \n3.  While processing the TA, ADB decided to expand the scope by potentially including all 18 \nADB DMCs of the CWA, East Asia, and South Asia subregions2 in the conduct of the feasibility \nstudy (phase 1) and the subsequent country consultations, subject to a positive feasibility \noutcome (phase 2). ADB deemed it appropriate to broaden the TA scope to (i) help improve the \nTCIGA business case since the larger the membership and geographical cover, the larger the \npotential trade and FDI flows and the better the risk spread; and (ii) make it easier for potential \nagency membership from ADB DMCs and non-ADB countries in adjacent subregions (i.e., \nEurasia, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific).3 Of the 18 DMCs, ADB has obtained \nno objections from 12.4 \n \n4.  The TA is aligned with a key operational priority (fostering regional cooperation and \nintegration) of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 through which ADB will enhance financial sector cooperation \nand  strengthen  subregional  initiatives. 5  It  is  also  aligned  with  Operational  Direction  1 \n(strengthening  connectivity  between  economies)  and  Operational  Direction  2  (improving \ncompetitiveness in connected markets) of ADB\u2019s regional cooperation and integration strategy.6 \n \n                                                \n1  The meeting, which CAREC organized, was used as a discussion platform to introduce the concept to prospective \nmember countries. Although the concept is noted in the CAREC 2030 strategy, the proposed TCIGA is not a CAREC \ninitiative and is not targeted exclusively for CAREC member countries. \n2  The pool of DMCs comprises Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Georgia, India, Kazakhstan, \nKyrgyz Republic, Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, \nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. \n3  The proposed TCIGA would be established by its own charter and eventually decide on its own membership eligibility \ncriteria. It would be desirable, however, if it were to opt for an as broad as possible membership, similar to the African \nTrade Insurance Agency (ATI), which is open to all 54 African Union member countries required to own at least 51% \nof ATI shares, while up to 49% of its remaining shares may be owned by non-African countries and non-state \nmembers. \n4  No objection letters have been received from Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Mongolia, Pakistan, the PRC, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan as of 26 September 2018. While the \nphase 1 feasibility study will cover all 18 DMCs based on analyses of publicly available historical outbound and \ninbound trade and FDI flows, these countersigned no-objection letters will allow for additional in-country activities, \nincluding (i) collecting and consolidating historic trade, FDI, macroeconomic, and other relevant data; (ii) reviewing \nrelevant legislation, regulations, and licensing requirements in relation to trade and investment; (iii) meeting relevant \nstakeholders (i.e., ministries, government agencies, bank and insurance regulators, industry and trade associations, \nmanufacturers,  producers,  suppliers,  traders,  commercial  banks,  insurers.  and  insurance  brokers);  and  (iv) \nconducting trade- and FDI-related surveys among relevant stakeholders. \n5  ADB. 2018.

International trade has historically been a precursor to the economic growth of developed \ncountries and since the 1980s of many emerging economies. Accordingly, most Asia and Pacific \nregion  countries  can  likewise  improve  their  economic  growth  through  intra-regional  and \ninterregional trade by addressing the constraints that adversely affect their trade competitiveness. \nExcept for India and the People\u2019s Republic of China, most economies in the CWA, East Asia, and \nSouth Asia subregions have underdeveloped trade facilitation mechanisms and inadequate trade-\nrelated infrastructure and financial support systems. These constraints limit the countries\u2019 ability \nto trade competitively and consequently reduce their capacity to diversify their economies and \nachieve sustained and inclusive growth.7 Having limited access to trade finance, in particular, \ndisadvantages small and medium-sized enterprises in relation to foreign competitors who can \naccess financial support and enhancements from national export credit agencies (ECAs) capable \nof offering insurance for extended payment terms and facilitating a lower cost of financing. This \nsituation discourages trade competition, further depriving small and low-income economies of \nprocesses that are crucial to attaining productivity growth.8 \n \n6.  TCIGA would encourage and support small and medium-sized enterprises and other \nnontraditional exporters to trade competitively domestically, regionally, and globally. Improving \nDMCs\u2019 competitiveness to trade within and outside their local markets is expected to promote \neconomic diversification and pave the way for sustainable long-term economic growth through \nincreased value-added production and employment in the region. \n \n7.  The proposed TCIGA is a tested concept and is expected to benefit from the lessons and \nexperiences of similar initiatives for other regions, such as the African Trade Insurance Agency \n(ATI) that has been in operation since early 2001.9 ADB has also been facilitating trade in the \nCWA, East Asia, and South Asia subregions through its Trade Finance Program. Managed by \nADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department, the Trade Finance Program supported about $30 \nbillion worth of transactions from 2009 to 2017.10 \n \n8.  TCIGA would provide, among other forms of support for trade and FDI typically offered by \nECAs, insurance against the nonpayment of global buyer receivables in relation to purchases of \ngoods and services from regional suppliers under pre-approved credit limits. Covering such \nreceivables would help de-risk the business continuity of suppliers and facilitate the diversification \nof the manufacturing and services sectors. \n \n9.  For the majority of potentially participating DMCs, TCIGA would offer insurance coverage \nthat would likely be superior than what can be offered by existing national ECAs and export-import \n                                                \n7  Hesse. 2008. Export Diversification and Economic Growth. Washington, DC: World Bank. \n8  Without access to domestic and export credit risk insurance to protect suppliers against nonpayment by local and \nforeign buyers, prudent suppliers cannot trade on an open account basis (i.e., against deferred payment terms), will \nhave to demand more stringent terms (e.g., cash in advance, cash against documents, or confirmed letters of credit), \nand are likely to lose trading opportunities to foreign competitors who have access to credit risk insurance. \n9  With assistance from the World Bank, ATI was established to support economic growth in Africa by increasing trade \nwith, and FDI in, its member countries by offering credit and political risk insurance products. ATI\u2019s membership \nstarted off with 7 countries and has expanded over time to 14 countries and 9 non-state members from Africa and \nEurope. ATI has supported over $35 billion worth of trade and FDI and continues to expand its partnerships and \npromote trade with North America and South America. \n10 ADB Trade Finance Program Newsletter Issue No.1, Volume III. January 2018. Transactions supported in CWA, \nEast Asia, and South Asia subregions during the same period amounted to $16.8 billion. \n \n ", "3 \n(EXIM) banks, which are capped by their sovereign ratings.11 TCIGA would likely have a higher \nrating than any of its DMCs\u2019 national ECA or EXIM bank since it has (i) a regionwide client base; \n(ii) globally diversified risk exposure to a wide range of domestic and foreign buyers and sectors; \n(iii) capital contributions from its DMCs members (potentially funded through ADB sovereign loans \nor grants to ADB DMCs); and (iv) potential equity participation from non-state members (e.g., \nmultilateral, regional, and bilateral development institutions, ECAs, EXIM banks, and public and \nprivate (re-)insurers).12 The diversification benefits would allow TCIGA to significantly leverage its \ncapital and expand its scope of operations. \n \n10.   For participating countries that already have a national ECA and/or EXIM bank, the \nproposed TCIGA should be considered complementary rather than overlapping. This is certainly \nthe case for relatively large developing economies in terms of gross domestic product and \npopulation.13 By fronting arrangements, TCIGA can pass on better credit terms by accepting \nreinsurance, re-guarantees, and/or unfunded risk participations from its member countries\u2019 ECAs \nand EXIM banks.14 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: sustainable economic growth through export \ndiversification and structural transformation enhanced. The TA will have the following outcome: \nMOUs firming up participation of prospective TCIGA member countries submitted.15 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n12.  Output 1: TCIGA feasibility assessed (phase 1). The TA will support the conduct of a \nfeasibility study that will include an ex ante assessment of the expected impact of the potential \nestablishment of TCIGA by (i) collecting and analyzing historical and projected future intra-\nregional and interregional trade and FDI flows; (ii) conducting comparative intra-regional and \ninterregional assessments of the participating DMC\u2019s capacity to compete internationally in pursuit \nof outbound trade and inbound FDI opportunities; and (iii) conducting a gap analysis and \ndetermining key (nontraditional) export sectors that TCIGA would likely support, taking into \naccount key lessons learned from similar regional initiatives already implemented (e.g., ATI) and \ncomparing the impacts of existing national ECAs and EXIM banks of prospective TCIGA member \ncountries,  as  well  as  selected  emerging  market  economies  and  member  countries  of  the \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). \n                                                \n11 DMCs with a better sovereign rating would benefit from participation in TCIGA as their trading partners would gain \ncapacity and skills and expand their product offering, resulting in further enhanced trade opportunities and relations. \n12 After its successful restructuring in August 2007, ATI obtained a Standard & Poor\u2019s A credit rating in March 2008 and \nhas maintained the same rating. If structured similarly, the proposed regional TCIGA is likely to obtain the same \ncredit rating, which is higher than the sovereign ratings of most of its potential member countries. \n13 They would benefit from participating in TCIGA in at least two ways. First, they would benefit from the leverage of all \ncapital contributions made by TCIGA\u2019s entire membership, providing additional underwriting capacity in support of \ntheir access to outbound and inbound trade credit and their capacity to attract FDI and pre-export finance to help \nexpand their producer and exporter base. Second, they would be able to benefit from international risk-sharing \nstandards through an investment grade or higher credit rating for TCIGA, enabling them to attract more favorable \ncredit terms in relation to inbound and outbound trade and FDI.  \n14 TCIGA is expected to have greater access to reinsurance and re-guarantee capacity from established international \npublic and private (re-) insurance markets, as well as from OECD and emerging country ECAs and EXIM banks \n(including India and the PRC), providing opportunities for developing country suppliers, contractors, and investors to \nteam up (e.g., as subcontractors) with OECD and emerging country contractors, suppliers, and investors. \n15 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \n13.  In addition, the TA will help identify key legal, regulatory, tax, and licensing counterparts \nand other relevant institutions, as well as the steps, procedures, clearances, and licenses needed \nfor TCIGA to conduct its business in each of its prospective member state jurisdictions and \nestablish legal, governance, management, and capital structures for it. The consultants will \nestablish statistically relevant correlations between historical intra-regional and interregional trade \nand FDI flows and key macroeconomic parameters to project future trade and FDI growth trends \nunder realistic growth scenarios and business penetration assumptions. For this purpose, the \nconsultants will also produce a robust financial model to forecast TCIGA base, upside, and \ndownside business cases and prepare draft business and operationalization plans for TCIGA and \ncorresponding Gantt charts. Finally, the consultants will prepare the final feasibility report. \n \n14.  Output 2: In-country consultations and workshops conducted (phase 2). Output 2 \nunder the TA\u2019s phase 2 is contingent upon TCIGA feasibility being established under the TA \nproject\u2019s phase 1 and comprises in-country consultations and workshops to be conducted to enter \ninto memorandum of understandings obtaining firm participatory commitments from interested \nDMCs, including through formal requests for sovereign financing support (i.e., loans or grants) to \nfund their equity participation in the proposed TCIGA.16, 17 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  Phase 1 of the TA is estimated to cost $2.3 million, of which (i) $0.3 million will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources), (ii) $1.5 \nmillion will be financed on a grant basis by the United Kingdom Fund for Asia Regional Trade and \nConnectivity under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility and \nadministered by ADB,18 and (iii) $0.5 million will be financed on a grant basis from the Regional \nCooperation and Integration Fund.19 Phase 2 implementation costs (estimated at $0.7 million) are \ncontingent and will be determined during the implementation of phase 1. Adequate TA resources \nwill also be secured during phase 1. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will administer the TA. The Public Management, Financial Sector, and Trade Division \nof ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department will implement the TA by adopting a \u201cOne ADB\u201d \napproach. It will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; organize in-country consultations \nand seminars; and monitor the TA implementation in cooperation with the East Asia Department, \nSouth Asia Department, Private Sector Operations Department, and other relevant departments. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 20 months starting in October 2018 in two phases: (i) \nphase 1 (conduct the TCIGA feasibility study) expected to be completed by November 2019 and \n(ii) phase 2 (conduct in-country consultations with prospective TCIGA members) expected to be \ncompleted by May 2020. Phase 2 implementation is contingent upon the feasibility study providing \na compelling business case for the establishment of the proposed TCIGA. \n \n                                                \n16 Such participation would be on an entirely voluntary basis and may not be limited to DMCs of the CWA, East Asia, \nand South Asia subregions only. \n17 If TCIGA\u2019s establishment is considered feasible, internal approval will be sought for a minor change of scope under \nthe TA to fully implement phase 2. \n18 Administered by ADB.
