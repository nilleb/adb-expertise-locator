INTRODUCTION\n1. Since their independence in the early 1990s, the republics of the former Soviet Union\n(FSU) have engaged in ambitious reforms to modernize their education and training systems to\nfacilitate  the  transition  to  market-based  economies  and  foster  national  unity.  The  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  supported  the  sector  reforms  and  been  a  major  source  of\nexternal  funding  for  education  in  the  Central  Asian  republics  and  Mongolia.  Through  this\nregional technical assistance (TA)1, ADB will promote education policy dialogue and cooperation\namong six2 of its developing member countries (DMCs) for the Trans-Caucasus and Central\nAsia (TCCA) subregion3: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, and\nUzbekistan.  The  ADB  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  Kazakhstan  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\nbetween 16 and 24 May 2000 to consult national education authorities and external assistance\nagencies on the proposed TA. The four other participating DMCs commented upon a concept\npaper  circulated  following  the  Fact-Finding  Mission  and  confirmed  their  willingness  to\nparticipate. The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, the countries of the TCCA subregion\nhave  embarked  on  major  programs  of  economic  reform  to  accelerate  the  transition  from\ncommand to market economies. Structural reform measures typically include liberalizing prices\nand trade, privatizing state-owned enterprises, promoting foreign investments, improving fiscal\nmanagement, and setting up new legal frameworks. In the first years after independence, these\ncountries  experienced  a  severe  economic  downturn  characterized  by  a  dramatic  fall  in\nagricultural and industrial output, and hyperinflation. In part, this was due to the breakdown of\ncommercial ties with other republics of the FSU and the termination of fiscal assistance from\nMoscow.4 More recently, economies of the TCCA subregion were affected by external shocks\nsuch as the Russian financial crisis, that began in August 1998 and a fall in commodity prices.\nIn some countries, economic and social recovery has been handicapped by ethnic conflict and\nwar. The decline in real gross domestic product (GDP) and reduction in government revenues\nled to severe cutbacks in the delivery of social services, including education. The recession\nlowered  living  standards  and  employment  levels  and  increased  inequalities  in  income\ndistribution.  The  main  indicators  measuring  well-being,  including  life  expectancy,  infant\nmortality, and criminality, worsened significantly. Increased attention was paid to the social\ndimensions of the reform process, in particular the need to protect vulnerable population groups\nby  improving  social  safety  nets  and  enhancing  the  employability  and  productivity  of  the\nworkforce.\n3. The rationale for investing in education in countries in transition is very strong. One part\nof the rationale is economic and relates to skills, adaptability to changing labor markets, and\ncontribution to the economy. The major goal of education reform in the subregion is to adapt\neducation systems to the new economic environment by teaching skills necessary for the\n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in January 2000.\n2  Pending formulation of an interim operational strategy, Turkmenistan will be invited to participate in the TA as an\nobserver.\n3  According to the grouping of countries adopted by the Education For All Forum sponsored by the World Bank, the\nUnited Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and the United Nations\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the TCCA subregion includes seven ADB DMCs\n(Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) plus Armenia and\nGeorgia.\n4  For instance, Russia\u2019s budgetary support to Tajikistan accounted for 40 percent of GDP before independence.", "2\ntransition  to  market  economies  and  providing  qualified  personnel  for  emerging  economic\nsectors. Another part of the rationale is social and relates to the creation of a common sense of\ncitizenship,  a  general  acceptance  of  obligations  and  responsibilities,  and  individual  rights.\nEducation  systems  are  expected  to  consolidate  social  cohesion  and  political  stability,  in\nparticular by disseminating values of tolerance and peace. Social considerations are extremely\nimportant in the Central Asian republics which gained independence relatively recently and are\ncharacterized by a complex ethnic structure and multilingualism.\n4. In an environment of GDP contraction and overall public sector retrenchment, public\nspending on education per student fell in real terms. Most countries reported a decline in the\nquality  of  education  attributed  to  deteriorating  teaching  conditions  in  schools  and  lack  of\nresources. Efforts to diversify the sources of finance by tapping nongovernment resources,\nencouraging community participation, and shifting funding responsibility from the central to local\ngovernments failed to fill the funding gap. These efforts generally tended to exacerbate regional\nimbalances in the delivery and quality of education services. Fiscal constraints have also meant\ngrowing pressures to make the delivery of education more efficient: most countries are now\nreconsidering the norms inherited from the FSU that still govern budget allocations and staff\ndeployment.5\n5. The education systems and sector challenges of the TCCA subregion are fundamentally\ndifferent from those of other ADB DMCs. Educational achievements in terms of access and\nparticipation are high in the TCCA subregion. The general perception of policymakers is that\nquality enhancement is a higher priority than capacity expansion and efficiency gains rather\nthan  additional  public  investment  are  required.  Reforming  the  contents  and  processes  of\neducation  to  improve  quality  and  relevance  is  the  major  sectoral  challenge for  the  TCCA\nsubregion. This involves developing new curricula, introducing modern textbooks and teaching\nmaterials, retraining teachers in subject content and teaching methodologies, and strengthening\nstudent  assessment  systems.  Major  changes  are  also  occurring  in  the  way  the  education\nsystem is administered. Priorities in education governance include the need to improve the\ndistribution of financial resources; decentralize management; promote community and parental\nparticipation;  encourage  private  education;  improve  information  systems;  and  strengthen\ninstitutional capacities in policy formulation, sector planning, and management.\n6. The process of reforming education is of particular importance in countries of the TCCA\nsubregion. A view often shared by education authorities and external assistance agencies is\nthat  the  reform  process  has  followed  a  top-down  approach  characterized  by  little  policy\ndiscussion  with  civil  society  and  education  stakeholders,  an  unclear  delineation  of\nresponsibilities  for  policy  making  and  reform  implementation  among  government  agencies,\ninadequate  feasibility  assessment  of  policy  measures,  and  an  ad  hoc  and  piecemeal\nintroduction of reforms. This approach tended to result in a poor sense of ownership of reforms\nand resistance to change by education stakeholders in the governments and civil society.\n7. Cooperation in education in the TCCA subregion collapsed with the Soviet Union. Yet\ncooperation is important and is driven by two factors: (i) common cultures, languages, and\nhistory influencing education goals and strategies; and (ii) relatively small size of individual\ncountries precluding economies of scale. At the policy level, countries can benefit from one\nanother\u2019s reform experiences and improve the coordination of their education policies. At the\n                                                \n5  The average pupil-teacher ratios in countries in transition are respectively 19:1 and 12:1 at primary and secondary\nlevels; the official teacher workload (number of hours spent in classes) is usually set between 14 and 18 hours per\nweek. These figures are much lower than those observed in countries with similar level of GDP per capita.", "3\nimplementation level, substantial economies of scale can be realized in teacher education,\ncurriculum and textbook development, distance education, and scientific research.\n8. The coordination of external assistance in the education sector6 remains largely informal\nand  based  upon  initiatives  taken  by  individual  agencies.  There  are  no  well-established\nmechanisms  for  information  exchange  and  joint  planning  of  activities  at  either  national  or\nsubregional level. This often results in duplication of efforts and conflicting support programs.\nWith external assistance agencies taking more interest in the TCCA subregion, the need for\ncoordination is growing but recipient governments are not in a position to guide and plan\nexternal assistance. The capacities of national agencies and ministries of education to absorb\nexternal assistance and manage externally-assisted projects remain weak, accentuating the\nneed for coordination.\n9. Since early 1997, ADB has provided TA to encourage economic cooperation among its\nDMCs in Central Asia, focusing on the energy, trade, and transport sectors. In view of its\naccumulated experience in the TCCA subregion and its lead role among external assistance\nagencies in terms of policy advice, volume of investments7 and scope of intervention, ADB has\na  clear  comparative  advantage  in  promoting  subregional  cooperation  in  education  and\ncoordinating external aid. ADB\u2019s involvement in education in the TCCA subregion is expected to\nexpand  as  human  development  remains  a  major  pillar  of  individual  country  operational\nstrategies.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n10. The general aim of the TA is to enhance the education reform process of the six\nparticipating DMCs by promoting subregional cooperation at the policy level. The TA will have\nthe following specific objectives: (i) disseminate information on experiences and practices in\neducation reform design and management in transition economies, (ii) promote the participation\nof  civil  society  in  sector  reforms,  (iii)  facilitate  high-level  policy  dialogue  between  national\ndecisionmakers  and  external  partners,  and  (iv)  identify  areas  and  programs  for  further\nsubregional education cooperation. The TA will provide an opportunity for ADB to take stock of\nits sector work experience and thus contribute to its sectoral assistance strategy, sharpening the\nfocus of lending and nonlending education operations.\nB.  Scope\n11.  Education  policy  issues  and  development  strategies  will  be  reviewed  by  each\nparticipating DMC and then collectively discussed with a view to sharing experiences and\nidentifying best practices regarding both the contents and processes of reforms. Activities will\ninclude (i) the preparation of country case studies on education reform management in the six\nparticipating  DMCs,  (ii)  two  subregional  workshops  to  guide  the  TA  research  work,  (iii)  a\nnational policy seminar in each of the six DMCs to discuss case study findings, (iv) a final policy\nconference on education reform management in the TCCA subregion, and (v) publication and\n                                                \n6  Beside ADB, the main external partners involved in the education sector include UNESCO, UNICEF, the World\nBank, the European Union, a few bilateral development institutions, and international nongovernment organizations\n(NGOs) such as the Open Society Institute, the Aga Khan Development Network, and Save the Children.\n7 As of 30 June 2000, ADB\u2019s portfolio of education projects (or social sector projects with education as major focus)\nin Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan comprised 12 loans totaling $240.2 million\nand 24 TAs, totaling $ 12.7 million.", "4\ndissemination  of  the  TA  findings.  The  two  subregional  workshops  and  the  final  policy\nconference will be held in three different participating DMCs.\n12. Country  case  studies  will  be  carried  out  in  the  six  participating  DMCs  by  national\ninstitutions with the support of international consultants and resource persons (para 19). The\ncase studies will investigate the process of reforming education and introducing change in the\nsystem  as  well  as  the  contents  of  the  reform  agenda  and  policies  pursued  by  national\nauthorities in the following areas: (i) education finance and efficiency; (ii) education governance\nand institutional reform; (iii) quality and relevance of education; and (iv) education, training, and\nemployment linkages. Particular attention will be paid to the poverty reduction dimension of the\neducation reforms and the effectiveness of external assistance interventions in the sector.\nAppendix 2 provides additional information on the preparation of case studies.\n13. Case studies will be presented and discussed at national policy seminars held in each of\nthe six participating DMCs. The seminars will bring together a variety of education stakeholders,\nincluding  representatives  of  the  central  ministries  of  education,  finance,  planning,  and\nemployment;  local  administrations;  business  enterprises;  university  faculties,  teachers,  aid\nagencies, foundations and NGOs. Providing an opportunity for dialogue between government\nand  nongovernment  bodies,  the  seminars  will  help  to  involve  civil  society  bodies  in  the\neducation policy debate and build consensus on reform priorities.\n14. Two subregional workshops, attended by international consultants, members of national\ninstitutions and ADB officials will be organized in two participating DMCs to enable discussion of\nthe research work and a sharing of experience. International consultants will help organize the\nworkshops and contribute background papers and presentations in their areas of expertise. The\nfirst workshop (inception) will promote joint planning and implementation of the research work\nand lead to the elaboration of the detailed terms of reference for the country case studies. The\nsecond workshop (review) will include a discussion of case study findings, identification of good\npractices and lessons to be drawn from the case studies, and elaboration of subregional project\nproposals.\n15. A final policy conference on education reform management in the TCCA subregion will\nbe organized in a participating DMC to review the results of the TA work. A synthesis paper will\nbe  prepared  by  the  international  consultants  as  the  main  background  document  for  the\nconference. The paper will include summaries of the case studies, highlights of the research\nfindings and policy recommendations, and proposals for subregional education initiatives. The\nconference,  bringing  together  decision  makers  from  the  participating  DMCs,  international\nexperts, and development agency staff will constitute an opportunity for a high-level policy\ndialogue between external assistance agencies and governments. It may pave the way for the\nestablishment of a forum for dialogue between national education authorities and their external\ndevelopment partners.8 7\n16. A final TA publication on education reform management in the TCCA subregion will be\nprepared both in English and Russian for wide distribution to national policymakers and officials\nof aid agencies. Country case studies will be disseminated mostly at the national level. The\n                                                \n8 The idea of launching such a forum emerged during discussions held by the Fact-finding Mission with UNICEF,\nUNESCO, and Soros Foundation. The forum may be patterned on the Association for the Development of\nEducation in Africa (ADEA) created at the joint initiative of the World Bank and UNESCO in 1989. The ADEA is an\nalliance of African Ministries of Education and their external partners; its principal objectives are to coordinate\ndonor initiatives and to promote sharing of information and experiences between countries.", "5\nmain TA reports, including the final TA publication and case studies, will also be accessible in\nelectronic form.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n17. The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $950,000  equivalent,  of  which  $750,000\nequivalent will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the\nGovernment of Japan, and $200,000 equivalent by the Governments of the participating DMCs.\nDetailed cost estimates are provided in Appendix 2.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n18. The TA will be carried out from March 2001 to May 2002 in three phases: (i) inception\nand research preparation (3 months), (ii) case study preparation and policy consultation (6\nmonths), and (iii) synthesis and dissemination (6 months).\n19. The  TA  will  require  the  services  of  three  international  consultants  (an  education\neconomist/team leader, an education sociologist, and a general educator) for a total of 10\nperson-months  and  a  research  assistant  for  a  total  of  6  person-months.  Leading  national\ninstitutions (social policy research institutes or local consulting firms) will be responsible for\npreparing case studies with the participation of resource persons and the methodological and\ntechnical  support  of  international  consultants.  Resource  persons  should  be  selected  from\nexternal aid agencies, NGOs, Government agencies, and education authorities in each country.\nThe six national institutions, three international consultants, and one research assistant will be\nselected and engaged by ADB through an international consulting firm in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  Terms  of  reference  for  national  institutions,\ninternational consultants, and the research assistant are provided in Appendix 3.\n20. The  consulting  firm  will  submit  to  ADB  detailed  quarterly  progress  reports  on  TA\nimplementation. ADB review missions will participate in the two subregional workshops. ADB\nstaff will directly supervise the preparation of the final TA publication and organization of the\npolicy  conference.  The  ADB  project  officers  responsible  for  ADB\u2019s  education  assistance\noperations in the six participating DMCs will act as resource persons, monitor the progress of\nTA  activities  in  their  country  of  assignment,  and  make  presentations  at  the  final  policy\nconference.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n21. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$750,000 for the

National Institutions  (Domestic Consultants)\n1. Country case studies on education reform management will be prepared by a lead\nnational institution (a research institute, nongovernment organization or consulting firm) in each\nof the six participating developing member countries. The national institutions will be selected\nand  contracted  by  the  international  consulting  firm.  The  responsibilities  of  the  national\ninstitutions will be as follows:\n(i)  collect  and  analyze  pertinent  information  for  carrying  out  the  case  studies,\nincluding national policy documents and programs, education legislation, sector\nanalysis, and other work carried out with the assistance of international agencies;\n(ii)  conduct  field  surveys,  interviews  and  group  meetings  with  education\nstakeholders, as required, for the preparation of the case studies (stakeholders\ninclude  government  agencies,  local  education  authorities,  nongovernment\norganizations, external agencies, and teachers and students).\n(iii)  select resource persons from each country\u2019s education authorities and prepare\nterms of reference for the resource persons;\n(iv)  work closely with international consultants, the international consulting firm and\nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) during review missions;\n(v)  attend and report on the two subregional workshops;\n(vi)  prepare draft terms of reference for country case studies, incorporate comments\nmade  by  resource  persons,  and  finalize  terms  of  refrences  following  the\nrecommendations made during the first subregional workshop;\n(vii)  produce  draft  case  studies  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  reference  and\nintegrate comments on first drafts made by the resource persons;\n(viii)  organize national policy seminars, present case studies at the seminars and\nfacilitate discussions during sessions;\n(ix)  revise country case studies incorporating the recommendations made during the\nsecond subregional workshop; and\n(x)  provide  interpretation  services  for  national  policy  seminars  and  an  English\ntranslation of all documents produced.\n2. The  principal  objectives  of  the  case  studies  are  to  (i)  describe  good  practices  and\nsuccessful experiences in education reform management; and (ii) analyze economic, institutional,\nand social constraints and opportunities in reform implementation. The case studies will provide", "10\nAppendix 3 page 2\nthe basis for (i) a cross-country analysis explaining convergences and divergences in policies\npursued  by  the    pursued  by  the  different  countries,  (ii)  an  assesment  of  the  potential  for\nsubregional cooperation in education and (iii) the possible identification of specific joint programs.\nThe case studies will focus on the process for introducing change and reforms in the education\nsystem. Legal and institutional aspects, formal and informal decision making and priority-setting\nmechanisms, and the roles of the various education stakeholders in influencing policies will be\nreviewed.\n3. Detailed terms of reference specifying the substantive focus of country case studies and\nresearch  methods  will  be  refined  during  the  first  phase  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  in\nconsultation  with  the  national  authorities  of  the  six  participating  DMCs  and  their  external\ndevelopment partners. Each country will have flexibility in the selection of the research contents\nand methods  to reflect country-specific perspectives and priorities. In all countries, the case\nstudies should review reform status and experiences in the following broad areas of reform:\n(i)  education finance and system efficiency: unit cost containment and rationalization\nmeasures (staff, facilities), cost-sharing mechanisms and user charges, alternative\nbudgeting  systems,  diversification  of  funding  sources,  mobilization  of  private\nfunding, private education development, and community participation;\n(ii)  governance of education and institutional reforms: legal framework of  reform; policy\ndialogue mechanisms and consultation with civil society; participation of education\nconstituencies  in  the  reform  process;  organizational  and  structural  changes  of\neducation  administration;  management  decentralization;  information  systems\ndevelopment  to  provide  transparency,  accessibility,  and  reliability;  and  moves\ntoward autonomy of institutions and school-based management;\n(iii)  quality  and  relevance  of  education:  curriculum  reform,  language  of  instruction\npolicies,  multicultural  education,  environmental  education,    development  of\ntextbooks and instructional materials, teacher education and retraining strategies,\navailability of textbooks and learning support materials, and monitoring of learning\nachievements; and\n(iv)  education, training and employment linkages: efforts to improve the flexibility and\nresponsiveness of education to labor market needs, strategies to reform technical\nand  vocational  education,  rationalization  of  higher  education  institutions  and\nprograms, and the economic returns of higher education and technical education.\n4. Other particular aspects to be analyzed in the case studies include\n \n(i)  effectiveness and coordination of externally assisted programs: mapping of external\nassistance in each the country, mechanisms for  coordinating external assistance\nand dialogue between governments and their external development partners, role of\ninternational expertise, and assessment of the effectiveness of programs supported\nby external aid agencies; and\n(ii)  poverty reduction dimension of education reforms: evidence of poverty reduction\nconcerns/perspectives in education policies; linkages between curriculum reform\nand employability of graduates; policies to retrain redundant workers; expansion of\nadult learning opportunities; promotion of equal access to quality basic education\nwith special attention to the situation of linguistic and cultural minorities, nomads,", "11\nAppendix 3 page 3\nand  with  special  attention  to  the  situation  of  linguistic  and  cultural  minorities,\nnomads,  and  people  living  in  remote  rural  areas;  pro-poor  public  expenditure\npatterns.\nB. International Consultants\n5.
