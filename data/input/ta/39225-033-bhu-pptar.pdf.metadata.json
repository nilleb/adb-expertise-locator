Justification \n1  The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is necessary in order to identify, \nformulate, and prepare the proposed Project. The PPTA will be used for preparing, mainly, a \nfeasibility study, which will include preliminary designs; preliminary engineering; cost estimates; \ntechnical,  financial,  economic,  and  socioeconomic  analysis;  environmental  analysis;  social \nimpact  assessment;  a  study  for  initial  benchmark  indicators;  and  a  project  administration \nmanual. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  Four candidate road sections have been identified to be part of the feasibility study, an \nestimated 350km of roads total (see Table below).  Prioritization will be needed during the PPTA \nstage.  Under the PPTA, the proposed candidate road sections are at follow:  \n \nCandidate Road Sections\nEnviromental \nNo. Road Name (connecting to) Total Length District Proposed Activities Conditions  Other Remarks\nAlong the Road\n1 Deothang-Nganglam Road 60 Samdrup Jongkhar and Pemagatohel  New Construction New Construction\n2 Gelegphu-Panbang 87 Sarpang and Zhemgang New Construction New Construction\n3 Lhamoizingkha-Sarpang Road 115 Dagana and Sarpang New Construction New Construction\n4 Samrang-Jomotshangkha 84 Samdrup Jongkhar New Construction New Construction\nkm = kilometer\nSource: Royal Government of Bhutan  \n \n3.

Cost Estimate and Proposed Financing Arrangement  \n4.  The TA is estimated to cost $650,000 equivalent, of which $600,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV).

Consulting Services \n5.  For the main portion of the PPTA, a firm of international consultants will be recruited \nusing the quality-and cost-based selection procedure, with a simplified technical proposal and a \n80:20 proportion of quality to cost. The services will be implemented over about 7 calendar \nmonths and will require about 16 international person-months and 16 national person-months. \nTable A5.3 shows the summary of consulting services requirements; see Annex 6 for the outline \nterms of reference. For environmental assessment, one national individual will be recruited \nusing the individual selection procedure to provide about 5 person-months of services. For \nsocial and resettlement assessment, one national individual will be recruited using the individual \nselection procedure to provide about 6 person-months of services (see Appendix 7 for the \noutline terms of reference). \n ", "16  Appendix 5 \n \nTable A5.3: Summary of Consulting Services Requirement \nInternational  National \nName of Positions  Person- Name of Positions  Person-\nmonths  months \nTeam Leader, and Road and  6.0  Deputy Team Leader and  7.0 \nHighway, and Pavement Engineer   Road/Civil/Structural Engineer \nRoad/Transport Economist  3.0  Road/Transport Economist  4.0 \nRoad/Highway Structural and  1.0  Geotechnical/Materials  2.0 \nBridge Engineer  Engineer \nGeotechnical/Materials Engineer  3.0  Senior Surveyor  3.0 \nCAD Technician  3.0  Social Resettlement Specialist  6.0 \n    Environmental Specialist  5.0 \n \n6.

The Department of Roads (DOR) will be the executing agency for the PPTA. A project \nmanagement unit is not envisioned. The government\u2019s in-kind contribution will be provision of \noffice  accommodation,  furnishings,  and  utilities.  The  government  will  provide  all  available \nreports, maps, and other pertinent data, and facilitate inter-agency coordination and applicable \npermits as necessary.  Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with the ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (May 2010, as amended from time to time) \n \n9.
