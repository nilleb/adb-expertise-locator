At the request of the Government of Bhutan, the Fact-Finding Mission from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) visited Bhutan from 25 March to 2 April 2003, to formulate technical \nassistance (TA) for preparing the Road Network Expansion Project.1 ADB held discussions with \nresponsible officials of the concerned agencies, including the Ministry of Finance, Department of \nAid and Debt Management, Ministry of Communications (MOC), Department of Roads (DOR) of \nMOC, Policy and Planning Division (PPD) of MOC, Planning Commission, and the National \nEnvironmental Commission. This TA was developed on the basis of understanding reached \nduring the Mission.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Bhutan, one of the least populated countries in the world, has a population of less than \n700,000 people. About 79% of the population live in rural areas, most of which are concentrated \nin the valleys. The transportation system depends heavily on the road network. Because of the \nmountainous terrain, the area of land suitable for agriculture is very limited and the population is \ndistributed  in  remote  scattered  settlements.  The  situation  makes  the  construction  and \nmaintenance of roads extremely difficult and costly. \n \n3.  Bhutan has about 3,920 kilometers (km) of roads, comprising about 1,560 km of national \nhighways (NHs), 480 km of district roads (DRs), 1,220 km of feeder roads (FRs), and urban and \nforest roads. All NHs and nearly half of the DRs and FRs are paved; however, 20% of NHs, \n53% of DRs, and 86% of FRs are in poor condition. Roads with narrow carriageway widths were \nbuilt along steep hillsides prone to landslides. Roads become difficult to use during the winter \nmonths and rainy season. Improvement and maintenance of the existing road network are \nurgent. \n \n4.  With the scattered settlements, many rural communities are still cut off from the road \nnetwork and depend on animal and head-load transport. The main routes consist of the east-\nwest highway (EWH) connecting Thimphu-Trashigang and 4 north-south highways following \nmajor river valleys. The network connects all districts, but still some areas can be reached only \nby horse, yak, or ox. More than 30% of blocks are not connected to feeder roads, and another \n30% are only partially connected to feeder roads. In this situation, farmers remain dependent on \nsubsistence agriculture, with no access to markets, education, and health care services. There \nis a need to expand the existing network to promote economic growth that will reach the rural \npoor. \n \n5.  The Government's Ninth Five-Year Plan (9FYP: 2002\u20132007) was prepared based on the \nneeds  of  local  governments.  Improving  the  quality  of  life  of  the  rural  population  through \nimproved access, reducing dependence on Indian highways for transport to various places in \nthe country, and more reliable and safe road transport are the transport sector goals of the Plan. \nDOR's main strategies under the 9FYP are to (i) shorthen, realign, widen, and improve selected \nNHs  to  reduce  transport  cost  and  travel  time,  and  to  enhance  safety;  (ii)  construct  new \nconnections and improve access of rural areas to the main network; and (iii) enhance private \nsector participation in road construction and maintenance activities. ADB's country strategy for \nBhutan  is  consistent  with  the  9FYP,  and  will  continue  to  place  high  priority  on  rural \ndevelopment, subregional cooperation, and private sector development. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in April 2003. ", "2 \n6.  ADB involvement in the transport sector in Bhutan started in 1983 through its loan and \nTA program, which has resulted in the rehabilitation and improvement of significant sections of \nthe main arterial road network, capacity building for institutions, and policy reforms in the sector. \nThe development impact of the previous projects has been significant, with a visibly enhanced \ndegree of commercial and agricultural development in the project areas. \n \n7.  ADB has provided significant advisory assistance, particularly within PPD and DOR, in \nprocurement,  construction  management,  regulatory  framework,  road  network  planning, \npavement management, and maintenance programming. The latest ADB-financed TA (footnote \n2) has encouraged planning and institutional strengthening in the transport sector.2 It assisted \nthe Government in preparing a road master plan, covering 2007-2027 (10FYP-13FYP), which is \nwell accepted by external financing agencies. The approach is to use generalized information to \ndetermine a ranking based on relative benefits and costs, and so establish a pipeline of possible \nprojects for implementation in the next 20 years under various levels of funding scenarios. It \nalso  provides  recommendations  to  improve  road  policy  and  a  management  system  that \nfacilitates efficient budget allocations for road development and maintenance.  \n \n8.  The TA also reviewed the issue of sustainable road maintenance. It found that due to \nvery low traffic volume resulting from a very low population, the current revenue from road user \ncharge, in the form of vehicle registration fees, is far below the required funds for maintenance. \nThe draft Road Act, prepared under the TA,3 provides for the creation of one or more road funds \nat national or local level as well as the setting procedures and regulations regarding payments \nand fees. Attention will be given to increasing revenues, particularly with respect to charges on \nfuel and heavy vehicles. However, increases in fuel price will have to consider the price in the \nadjacent countries to prevent smuggling. Given the very low traffic volume, there will be little \nscope for introducing tolls or a build-operate-transfer scheme in Bhutan. The TA therefore \nsuggests gradually introducing road user charges, earmarking of road user revenues, and \neventually establishing a road fund at a later stage. The proposal will need further analysis as \nthe level of charges should not reduce the economic benefits resulting from the improved roads \nand the costs of revenue collection and fund administration should not be excessive compared \nwith the expected incremental revenue.  \n \n9.  The Government appreciates that road sector performance can be improved through \nprivate sector participation. More road works should be contracted out to the private sector \nrather  than  executed  by  DOR.  In  recent  years,  DOR  has  been  moving  in  this  direction. \nCorporatization of the Mechanical Division is being proposed. However, awarding some works \nto the private sector only will not lead to achieving the vision of privatization. DOR should \neventually  act  as  a  facilitator,  supervisor,  and  certifier  of  road  works.  On  the  other  hand, \ndevelopment of a local consulting and contracting industry is still a pressing need. The industry \nis weak in human resources and lacks access to financing and equipment. There is a need to \ndevelop a systematic privatization strategy. Such strategy should include a careful analysis of \nthe present situation and a proposal on available options for phased privatization. \n \n10.  To facilitate the positive reform of the road sector institutions, there is a need to prepare \na road map to guide the Government, ADB, and other development partners in the sector in \nBhutan in the next 5 - 10 years. The Government and ADB agreed that if the objectives of the \nroad map are to be achieved, a time-bound realistic and achievable medium-term action plan \nmust be prepared. \n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n3 The draft Road Act is under review and will be submitted to the National Assembly during its 2003 session. ", "    3 \n11.  Together with the involvement of other external agencies, ADB's interventions have \nresulted in the rehabilitation and improvement of significant sections of the main highways. As \nthe EWH is of strategic importance to Bhutan, providing the only link through the east, central, \nand western regions of the country without traveling via India, continued attention remains \nessential. Equally important, it is necessary to develop a road network for rural development to \nensure that social and economic benefits from the main network improvements are maximized \nand that benefits extend to the rural population. Poverty reduction through economic growth and \nimproved access for the poor is the theme of ADB's interventions in the transport sector.  \n \n12.  The Government and ADB also recognize that, as a landlocked country, Bhutan will \nbenefit from regional links and cooperation with adjacent countries that can provide access to \nmarkets  abroad.  Bhutan  is  participating  in  dialogues  on  multimodal  transport  and \ncommunication  through  the  ADB-assisted  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation \n(SASEC), comprising Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal. A transport sector initiative was \nundertaken  in  October  2001,  and  a  sector  analysis  was  completed.  The  sector  analysis \nidentified the current problems facing the subregional transit and transportation systems are \nlargely  due  to  institutional  problems.  A  subsequent  TA,  Subregional  Corridor  Operational \nEfficiency Study, will soon start to assess the operational efficiency of selected subregional \ncorridors.  On  the  Bhutan  side,  the  indicative  road-based  subregional  corridor  is  Thimphu-\nPhuentsholing, and ADB is providing a TA for preparing the industrial estate and dry port \ndevelopment  project  in  Phuentsholing.4  Improvement  of  Thimphu-Phuentsholing  is  included \nunder  the 9FYP  with  committed  financing from  the  Government  of  India.  To enhance  the \ndevelopment objectives of the subregional cooperation, other links to India, including Trongsa-\nGelephu, need to be improved. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n13.  Efficient  transport  and  improved  access  in  particular  are  two  keys  to  economic \ndevelopment leading to poverty reduction. Investment in roads is part of a continuing program to \nsupport the development of an integrated and balanced road network in the country. The TA will \nhelp  the  Government  improve  transport  efficiency  by  preparing  a  project  that  aims  to  (i) \nstrengthen  the  road  sector  institutions,  (ii)  promote  domestic  and  international  trade  by \nimproving strategic road networks, and (iii) improve the quality of life of rural communities by \nproviding access roads. \n \n14.  The output will consist of the (i) formulation of a midterm road sector development \nframework, recommending steps for achieving the sector objectives; and (ii) preparation of a \nroad investment component that is economically viable, technically feasible, and socially and \nenvironmentally responsible.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n1.  Sector Development Component \n \n15.  The TA will (i) review related Government policy documents, ADB's and other external \nagencies' sector strategy and program, and other relevant studies; (ii) review and analyze \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2002.

", "4 \nsector performance, key problems, opportunities for development, needs, and development \nchallenges; (iii) propose strategies, including financing strategies, to resolve key problems; and \n(iv) prepare a pragmatic and achievable medium-term action plan to implement the strategies. \nThe TA will also assist in the initial implementation of the action plan and prepare a privatization \nstrategy. Stakeholder workshops will be conducted as necessary to ensure participation and \npromote a sense of ownership of the strategies. \n \n2.  Investment Component \n \n16.  The  TA  will  review  and  update  the  feasibility  study  of  the  EWH  of  Simtokha  - \nWangduephodrang (64 km), and the north-south highway of Trongsa\u2013Gelephu (244 km).5 It is \nproposed  that  the  roads  be  strengthened,  upgraded,  and  widened  as  appropriate  to \naccommodate the projected traffic. Baseline data will be updated for the current situation, \nanalysis and assessment will be revisited in accordance with the latest ADB requirements, \nguidelines, and handbooks for project preparation.  \n \n17.  A feasibility study will be carried out for about 130.5 km new FRs. These FRs will \nprovide initial connections to remote and poor villages that are otherwise isolated from the \neconomic mainstream. The roads that are proposed and prioritized under the 10FYP road \nmaster plan cover the following districts:  \n \nDagana  :  Drukyegang \u2013 Lajab (35 km) \nTsirang  :  Burichu \u2013 Patale (8 km) and Dunglegang \u2013 Katike (10 km) \nPemagatshel  :  Nangkhor \u2013 Gamung (10 km) \nTrashigang  :  Zugpola \u2013 Kurichilo (15 km) \nChhukha  :  Mirchim \u2013 Bongo \u2013 Getana (52.5 km)  \n \n18.  The consultant will (i) identify the existing condition of the roads; (ii) forecast traffic flows \nfor 20 years; and (iii) identify optimum improvement and construction strategies, taking into \naccount the adoption of DOR's environment\u2013friendly road construction approach. Economic \nevaluation will be carried out following ADB's Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, \ntaking into account the extreme conditions of Bhutan and its low traffic volumes. Consideration \nwill be given not only to savings from transport cost reduction, but also overall net benefits in \nproviding access to market, health, education, and other essential services. \n \n19.  Environmental  assessment  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s guidelines and procedures. Social analysis will be carried out in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines for the Incorporation of Social Dimensions in ADB Operations. The summary \ninitial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 1. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent, comprising $432,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $193,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  provide  $500,000 \nequivalent,  covering  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $68,000  equivalent  of  the  local \ncurrency cost, on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of \nJapan. The Government of Bhutan will finance the remaining $125,000 equivalent in local \n                                                 \n5  These road sections were studied, completed in 1999, under the previous Technical Assistance for Preparing Road \nTransport Network Development Project, but the sections were not taken up under the follow-on loan (Road \nImprovement Project) due to fund constraints. Although prioritized, the roads were not implemented under the \n9FYP and therefore will slip into the 10FYP. ", "    5 \ncurrency, covering counterpart staff and related salaries, office accommodation, and related \nservices and facilities. The detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nThe Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance the \nensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  MOC will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The Implementing Agency will be DOR. \nUnder the existing project management unit for ADB-financed projects within DOR, an assistant \nproject  manager  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  TA,  including \ncoordinating with concerned line ministries, agencies, and external funding agencies. Close \ncoordination and extensive consultation with PPD will be necessary in preparing the medium-\nterm sector road map. The Government has assured the Mission that all required counterpart \nstaff,  office  space,  furniture,  equipment,  support  facilities  for  technical  surveys  and \ninvestigations and for laboratory services, maps, reports, and other support services, will be \nmade available to the consultants in a timely manner. \n \n22.  The TA will be implemented over 6 months, beginning around November 2003 and \nending in April 2004. A multidisciplinary team of consultants will provide about 17 person-\nmonths of international and 14 person-months of domestic inputs. The consultants will have \nexpertise in (i) institutional and private sector development, (ii) transport economics, (iii) road \nengineering, (iv) environment, and (v) social development. All consultants will be selected and \nrecruited through a firm using the quality- and cost-based selection method, in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nengaging  domestic  consultants.  Simplified  technical  proposals  will  be  requested  from  the \nshortlisted consultants. Terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n23.  The consultants will submit an inception report no later than 3 weeks after commencing \ntheir services, focusing on the work program and feeder roads selection. An interim report will \nbe submitted 3 months after TA inception, and a draft final report will be submitted 5 months \nafter their services begin. A tripartite meeting of the Government, consultants, and ADB to be \nheld in Thimphu and chaired by DOR will review the draft final report. Within 3 weeks after the \nmeeting, the consultants will submit a final report, in a format acceptable to ADB, incorporating \nall comments received on the draft final report from the Government and ADB. A stakeholders \nworkshop  will  be  conducted  on  the  road  sector  development  framework  and  privatization \nstrategy. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bhutan for preparing the Road Network Expansion Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nSUMMARY INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.

The construction will be implemented using environment-\nfriendly construction methods, which are labor extensive, and will provide employment opportunities \nto local communities. It will reduce poverty by increasing economic efficiency through lower costs \nand prices and enhanced social and economic opportunities.  Although the Project will not be \nfocused  on  direct  poverty  reduction,  explicit  attention  to  poverty  issues  and  specific  poverty \ncomponents will be addressed during PPTA stage. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Proposed Classification: PI \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nPoverty assessment will be conducted to (i) identify the poverty profile of the population affected by \nthe  Project  (including  users);  (ii)  assess  the  relevant  market  structure  and  estimate  the  likely \ndistributive impacts of the project; (iii) where appropriate, incorporate the needs of the poor, and \nminimize or compensate for adverse impacts on the poor; (iv) identify more systematic integration of \nthe Project with other sectoral interventions (health, education, rural development, etc.) so as to \nstrengthen poverty reduction strategies; and (iv) develop low-cost mechanisms for monitoring to \ncontribute to the understanding of the links between the Project and poverty reduction. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholder analysis: \n    \nThis  TA  is  being  developed  through  extensive  consultation  with  government  and  private \nstakeholders.
