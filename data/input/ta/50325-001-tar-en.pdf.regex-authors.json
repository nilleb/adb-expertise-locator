INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will enable responsible growth of \nthe  Islamic  finance  industry  as  an  additional  vehicle  for  savings,  infrastructure  financing, \nportfolio  diversification,  and  to  promote  financial  inclusion  in  the  Philippines.  This  will  be \nachieved through the development of a regulatory framework appropriate for sustainable Islamic \nfinance  operations  and  capacity  building  activities  for  selected  regulators  and  market \nparticipants in the country.  \n \n2.  The TA was not included in the country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for the \nPhilippines, but has been requested by the Government of the Philippines and is consistent with \nboth (i) the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which recommends that the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) deepen its support for financial inclusion; and (ii) the Review of the 2011 Financial \nSector Operations Plan,1 which recommends that ADB increase operational involvement in \nIslamic finance.2 The TA is also aligned with the proposed Inclusive Finance Development \nProgram,3 which will support government efforts to increase financial inclusion throughout the \nPhilippines.  \n   \n3.  The TA builds on previous ADB TA for Islamic finance sector development, including \nImplementing Prudential Standards in Islamic Finance,4 and Development of Prudential and \nSupervision  Standards for Islamic  Financial  Markets.5 Major  lessons from  the  previous TA \nprojects include the importance of country ownership and information sharing between countries \nat different stages of Islamic finance development. ADB began providing capacity building \nsupport  to  the  Central  Bank  of  the  Philippines  (BSP)  under  the  Implementing  Prudential \nStandards in Islamic Finance project (footnote 4).  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Islamic financing is one of the fastest growing segments of international finance in the \nworld. The Islamic finance industry\u2019s total worth across its three main sectors (banking, capital \nmarkets, and takaful)6 was estimated at $1.89 trillion in 2016,7 and global Islamic finance assets \nare forecast to reach $3.5 trillion by 2021.8 The volume of annual sukuk issuances reached $75 \nbillion in 2016,9 bringing the volume of outstanding sukuk to $318.5 billion (footnote 7). As home \nto around 60% of the world\u2019s Muslims, Asia is in the midst of this development with a 22.5% \nshare of the global Islamic finance assets (footnote 7). \n \n5.  Efforts  by  some  Asian  governments  to  support  and  develop  their  domestic  Islamic \nfinancial services industries have helped drive Islamic finance growth in Asia. Through sound \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017. Review of 2011 Financial Sector Operations Plan.

Dubai. \n9 A sukuk is an investment instrument (traded like a conventional bond) that provides the investor with undivided \nownership of an underlying asset. \n ", "2 \neconomic, financial, regulatory, and growth policies, Malaysia has established itself as Asia\u2019s \nprincipal  Islamic finance  market.  Malaysia\u2019s  Islamic financial  institutions  hold  23.8%  of the \ncountry\u2019s total domestic banking assets, and the country accounts for 9.3% of Islamic banking \nassets globally (footnote 7). Malaysia similarly dominates in capital markets, accounting for  \n50.8% of total sovereign sukuk issuance and 50.2% of total corporate sukuk issuance in 2016 \n(footnote 7); it is the largest takaful market in Southeast Asia, with 62% of the market share in \n2015.10  \n \n6.  The  Philippines  was  one  of  the  first  Muslim-minority  countries  to  recognize  the \nimportance of Islamic finance. In 1973, the Philippine Amanah Bank was established to address \nthe pressing need to expand the banking and credit system in Mindanao,  where a majority of \nthe country\u2019s Muslim population resides.11 The bank\u2019s charter was revised in 1974 with the \nmandate that it operate \u201cbased on the Islamic Concept of Banking,\u201d to follow and respect the \nreligious beliefs and practices of Muslim Filipinos.12 In 1990, the Philippine Amanah Bank was \ntransformed into the Al-Amanah Islamic Investment Bank of the Philippines (Amanah Bank) \nunder  a  legislative  charter  mandating  that  it  promote  and  accelerate  the  socioeconomic \ndevelopment of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) by performing banking, \nfinancing, and investment operations based on the concept of Islamic banking.13  \n \n7.  Despite this early and promising start, the Philippines currently has an inadequate legal \nand regulatory framework for Islamic finance. The country\u2019s General Banking Law of 2000 \nrecognizes \u201cIslamic banks\u201d as a category of banking institutions,14 and provides that \u201c[t]he \norganization, ownership and capital requirements, powers, supervision and general conduct of \nbusiness of Islamic banks shall be governed by special laws.\u201d15 However, Congress has yet to \nenact the general legislative framework for Islamic banking, capital markets, and insurance. \nMore recently, bills providing for the regulation and organization of an expanded Islamic banking \nsystem  in  the  Philippines  have  been  filed  in  both  the  Philippine  Senate  and  House  of \nRepresentatives, but have not been enacted into law.16  \n \n8.  The lack of an appropriate legal and regulatory framework for Islamic finance has slowed \ndevelopment of Islamic finance in the country. The Amanah Bank, which is currently the only \nIslamic bank operating in the Philippines, has faced severe operational challenges because of \nthe inadequate legal and regulatory framework, and Islamic finance-related capacity constraints \n(e.g., lack of technical capability, undercapitalization, and lack of Islamic liquidity management \nand investment avenues). Amanah Bank has reported net losses for several years, which \ntotaled \u20b123,538,265 in 2015, and \u20b151,506,827 in 2016.17 Although Amanah Bank has its own \nlegislative charter (footnote 13), the absence of an appropriate enabling regulatory framework \nfor Islamic finance (which includes tax neutrality for Islamic finance transactions) means that \nAmanah Bank has continued to struggle to operate as a viable banking institution. \n  \n9.  In addition to an inadequate legal and regulatory framework, the Philippines also lacks \nexposure  to  and  experience  with  Islamic  finance  transactions,  and  thus  has  insufficient \n                                                \n10  Milliman Research Report. 2017.

Access to training and education \non Islamic finance is limited, constraining development of talent and capacity. Both the capacity \nand competence to deliver Islamic finance services is lacking, and regulators are not equipped \nwith the expertise to operationalize and supervise Islamic finance transactions.  \n \n10.  Development of Islamic finance in the Philippines would promote financial inclusion, \nespecially among those who choose to remain unbanked for religious reasons. Conventional \nbanking has been slow to expand in the ARMM, where a majority of the country\u2019s Muslim \npopulation resides. As of 2015, there were only 21 banks and 33 automated teller machines\u2014\nand no microbanking offices\u2014serving all of the ARMM, which has a population of 3,781,387.18 \nIn 2015 the ARMM made the smallest contribution (.7%) to national gross domestic product of \nany region in the country.19 The potential for conventional and Islamic banking to cater to the \nneeds of Muslim Filipinos and boost economic development in Mindanao is evident. Islamic \nfinance may also attract increased infrastructure investment from Islamic finance investors. In \nparticular, sukuk has been increasingly used to fund infrastructure development projects. In \n2016, infrastructure-linked sukuk issuers (predominantly in Malaysia) involved in the power and \nutilities, transportation and telecommunication sectors collectively accounted for $12.5 billion \n(16.7%) of total sukuk issuances (footnote 7).  Islamic finance would complement and support \nthe government\u2019s goal of accelerating the country\u2019s infrastructure development to account for    \n5% of gross domestic product, and may provide a viable additional and/or alternative source of \nprivate capital and investments for public\u2013private infrastructure projects.20 The Bureau of the \nTreasury (BTr) is exploring issuing the first sovereign sukuk for the Philippines.  \n \n11.  The challenge for the Philippine government will be to (i) develop an Islamic finance \nindustry  in  a  measured,  inclusive,  and  sustainable  manner;  (ii)  build  adequate  capacity  in \nIslamic finance within the public and private sector for solid service delivery; and (iii) raise \nawareness of Islamic finance as a viable alternative to conventional finance, both for Muslims \nand those seeking to diversify their financial services options.  \n \n12.  In light of these challenges, the government has requested ADB to provide assistance in \n(i) formulating and drafting the implementing rules and regulations needed to operationalize \nIslamic finance; and (ii) enhancing the competence and capacity of regulators to implement and \nsupervise Islamic finance operations.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The TA will be aligned with the following impact: the socioeconomic development of the \nPhilippines promoted and accelerated through the creation of Islamic banks and designated \nIslamic banking units.21  \n \n14.  The TA will have the following outcome: Islamic financial services in the Philippines \nexpanded under a suitable legal and regulatory environment.22  \n                                                \n18 Government of the Philippines, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. 2015.

Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n15.  Output  1:  Regulatory  framework  for  Islamic  finance  of  acceptable  quality \ndeveloped. A gap analysis will be conducted to determine the ideal legislative framework and \nthe implementing rules and regulations required to support a robust Islamic finance market. The \nanalysis will examine the country\u2019s tax framework to determine what rules and regulations are \nneeded to promote tax neutrality (tax neutrality measures are intended to ensure equal tax \ntreatment for Islamic finance products and services).23 The relevant implementing rules and \nregulations required will be developed, drafted, and finalized. The preparation of the legislative \nand regulatory framework will serve as the foundation for the development of the Islamic finance \nindustry in the Philippines. \n \n16.  Output 2: Regulatory and market capacity to deliver Islamic financial services \nstrengthened. Capacity building activities\u2014for BSP, BTr, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), \nDepartment  of  Finance  (DOF),  Financial  Reporting  Standards  Council  (FRSC),  Insurance \nCommission,  Philippine  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  (PDIC),  Securities  and  Exchange \nCommission  (SEC),  and  other  selected  regulators  and  market  participants,  including  the \nAmanah Bank and private sector banks intending to provide Islamic financial services\u2014will be \nundertaken to enable these entities to develop, regulate and supervise, and provide Islamic \nfinance  services  in  the  Philippines.  Public  and  private  sector  participants from  the  Muslim \ncommunity  in  the  Philippines  (including  governmental  officials  and  regulators  from  ARMM, \nacademia, and business) will be included. The Philippines may benefit from the partnership \nbetween  ADB  and  the  Islamic  Financial  Services  Board  (IFSB),  a  Kuala  Lumpur-based \ninternational standard-setting body that promotes development of a prudent and transparent \nIslamic financial services industry and has a structural capacity building approach suitable for \noutput 2. BSP is a member of IFSB, and capacity building on prudential standards can be \nundertaken in partnership with IFSB. Training will be provided using various methods (e.g., \nconferences, intensive workshops, and training courses developed by expert consultants). ADB \nstaff and consultants may also conduct general training on Islamic finance to raise public \nawareness. Major lessons under previous TA projects (para. 3) were the importance of country \nownership and information sharing between countries at different stages of Islamic finance \ndevelopment. The TA aims to facilitate such cross-border dialogue between the Philippines and \ncountries where Islamic finance development is at a more advanced stage. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000, of which $550,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 2. \n   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The executing agency for the TA will be BSP; in that capacity, BSP will be the main \ncounterpart  agency  for  the  TA.  BSP  will  be  responsible  for  TA  implementation,  including \ncoordinating  with  other  regulatory  entities,  including  BIR,  BTr,  DOF,  FRSC,  the  Insurance \nCommission, PDIC and SEC. A working group will be established with senior representatives \n                                                \n23 Several Islamic financial products require multiple transactions (more than their conventional counterparts) to \nachieve functional equivalence, and face additional tax burdens under most existing legal and taxation systems. \nCountries developing indigenous Islamic financial markets need to consider taxation and regulatory changes. \n ", "5 \nfrom ADB, ARMM, BIR, BSP, BTr, DOF, FRSC, the Insurance Commission, PDIC, SEC, and \nother key agencies and participants to guide and supervise TA implementation.   \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s Office of the General Counsel will be responsible for the administration and \nsupervision of the implementation of the TA in close coordination with the Public Management, \nFinancial Sector, and Trade Division, Southeast Asia Department. ADB will engage individual \nconsultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to \ntime)  and  the  associated  project  administration  instructions  and  TA  staff  instructions.24 To \nreduce the administrative burden and improve economy, efficiency, and value for money, lump-\nsum payments and/or output-based contracts will be considered for consulting services under \nthe TA. All disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n20.  BSP  officials,  government  officials,  and  investors  and/or  bankers  will  make  time \navailable to participate in regulatory reform and capacity building activities. BSP will also provide \noffice  space,  venues  for  training  sessions,  and  assist  with  logistical  arrangements.  It  is \nenvisaged  that  some  training  sessions  will  be  undertaken  within  Malaysia  to  leverage  its \nknowledge  and  experience  as  Asia\u2019s  principal  Islamic  finance  market.
