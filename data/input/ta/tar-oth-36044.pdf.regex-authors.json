At the seventh meeting of the Experts Group on Power Interconnection and Trade (EGP) \nin May 2002, the countries of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS)1 endorsed the findings and \nrecommendations of the study for the regional indicative master plan on power interconnection \nand requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for project preparatory technical assistance \n(TA) to prepare a feasibility study for the identified power transmission interconnection between \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and Viet Nam. Following a three-country \nconsultation meeting during 16\u201317 June 2003 in Manila at ADB headquarters, an ADB Fact-\nFinding Mission visited Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam in July/August 2003 and reached an \nunderstanding with each government on the goals, purpose, scope, outline terms of reference, \nand implementation arrangements for the TA. The TA has been included in ADB\u2019s 2002 GMS \nSubregional Cooperation Strategy and Program Summary and ADB\u2019s 2003 Viet Nam Country \nStrategy and Program Update.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  ADB has played a lead role in GMS cooperation in the electric power sector as part of \nthe program for economic cooperation in the GMS that ADB initiated in 1992. The Subregional \nElectric Power Forum (EPF) and EGP meetings under the GMS activities have been held with \nADB\u2019s assistance to enhance subregional cooperation in the electric power sector. The main \nobjectives of the EPF are to (i) promote opportunities for extended economic cooperation in the \nelectric power sector; (ii) facilitate implementation of priority subregional power projects; and (iii) \naddress technical, economic, financial, and institutional issues relevant to subregional power \nsector development. The EGP was created in June 1998 to discuss detailed work programs and \nrecommend its findings to the EPF to (i) promote development of a subregional transmission \nnetwork, and (ii) facilitate the expansion of cross-border power trade. \n \n3.  Subregional  electricity  trade  based  on  interconnected  electric  power networks will \nprovide significant economic and environmental benefits for individual countries and the entire \nsubregion. Such trade will enable members to (i) reduce national investments in the power \nreserves maintained to meet peak demand; (ii) provide a more reliable supply of electricity, \nincluding power supply from an interconnected network in case of power failure; (iii) reduce \noperational costs; (iv) reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants; and (v) increase \nconsumers\u2019  access  to  the  cheapest  and  most  environment-friendly  sustainable  source  of \nelectricity in the subregion. \n \n4.  To provide the policy framework for promoting opportunities for extended economic \ncooperation  on  regional  power  trade  and  facilitating  the  implementation  of  priority  power \nprojects in the GMS, the Policy Statement on Regional Power Trade in the GMS was endorsed \nin January 2000 by all members. In addition, the Inter-Governmental Agreement on Regional \nPower Trade in the GMS (IGA) was signed by all six GMS members at the first GMS summit \nmeeting on 3 November 2002. The IGA is the first outcome of the highest commitment by all \nmembers to promote regional power trade and toward a competitive electricity market. Through \nthe IGA, all members can (i) coordinate and cooperate in planning and operating their systems \nto minimize costs while maintaining satisfactory reliability, (ii) fully recover their costs and share \n                                                 \n1  The GMS consists of Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam, and Yunnan \nProvince of the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 23 February 2002. ", "2 \nequitably in the resulting benefits, and (iii) provide reliable and economical electricity service to \ncustomers of each country. \n \n5.  Besides the policy framework for promoting regional power trade, the regional indicative \nmaster plan on power interconnection in the GMS3 was developed starting in October 2000 with \nADB\u2019s assistance to (i) identify necessary physical power interconnections in the subregion up \nto  2020;  and  (ii)  harmonize  transmission  planning,  design,  and  operational  practices.  All \nmembers endorsed the indicative master plan in May 2002 at the seventh meeting of the EGP. \n \n6.  In accordance with the IGA, the guidelines for the establishment of the regional power \ntrade coordination committee were discussed and adopted at the eighth EGP meeting on \n10 October 2002. The guidelines specified the objectives, function, representation, coordinators, \nchairperson, and working groups. To specify in detail rules and guidelines for the power trade \nunder the IGA, a regional power trade operating agreement (PTOA) in the GMS will be prepared \nwith ADB assistance.4 The PTOA is a vital and integral component of the GMS flagship \nprogram, which was endorsed by the GMS summit meeting. The PTOA will provide harmonized \nrules of technical coordination and agree cross-border transmission tariff schemes, and will \nhave  an  important  role  in  providing  the  policy  environment  needed  to  attract  physical \ninvestments from the private sector. \n \n7.  The master plan study recommended an indicative plan on power interconnections in the \nsubregion, based on power demand forecast, generation and transmission system  planning \nscenarios, and its economic evaluation. The recommendations include (i) a 230 kilovolt (kV) line \nbetween Phnom Penh in Cambodia and Chau Doc in Viet Nam in 2004;5 (ii) 115 kV line \nbetween Thailand and western Cambodia in 2004; (iii) 500 kV line between Roi Et in Thailand \nand Ha Tinh in Viet Nam via the Lao PDR in 2009; (iv) 500 kV line between Savannakhet in the \nLao PDR and Pleiku in Viet Nam in 2010; (v) 230 kV line between Nam Mo in the Lao PDR and \nBan Mai in Viet Nam in 2009; (vi) 230 or 500 kV line between Na Bon in the Lao PDR and Udon \nThai in Thailand in 2008; (vii) 500 kV line between Tasang in Myanmar and Mae Moh in \nThailand  in  2012;  (viii) 500 kV line between Jinghong of Yunnan province of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) and Tha Wung in Thailand in 2013; (ix) 230 or 500 kV line between \nMalutang of Yunnan Province in the PRC and Soc Son in Viet Nam in 2019; and (x) 230 kV line \nbetween Sambor in Cambodia and Tan Dinh in Viet Nam in 2019.6 The proposed transmission \nline between Roi Et and  Ha Tinh will be the first power interconnection among the three \ncountries in the GMS to link power networks of Thailand and Viet Nam. \n \n8.  The transfer of about 1,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity via a new double-circuit 500 \nkV transmission line from the power plant of the proposed Nam Theun 2 hydropower project in \nthe Lao PDR to Roi Et in Thailand has been under preparation by a private company, called \nNam Theun 2 Power Company. The Nam Theun 2 Project is structured as a build-own-operate-\ntransfer, with a concession period of 25 years.  The concession agreement was signed in \nOctober 2002 by the Government of the Lao PDR and a developer. The power purchase \nagreement was formally signed on 8 November 2003 by the Electricity Generating Authority of \nThailand, Electricit\u00e9 du Laos, and a developer. The construction of the new transmission line is \nscheduled to be completed in 2009/10.

", "    3 \n500 kV between Thailand and the Lao PDR, construction of an additional transmission line from \nthe Lao PDR to Viet Nam will interconnect the grids of Thailand and Viet Nam and enable both \ncountries to exchange electric power under different peak loads.7 This transmission line may be \nused for future power export from the Lao PDR to Viet Nam.  \n \n9.  Through the proposed interconnection, the first power exchange between Thailand and \nViet Nam via the Lao PDR will be realized in the subregion. With the different peak loads in both \nThailand and Viet Nam, the study estimated that the reduction in the installed capacity would be \nroughly 350-450 MW for Viet Nam and 800 MW-1000 MW for Thailand during 2008\u20132011.8 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The purpose of the TA is to support GMS members\u2019 strategy for promoting regional \npower exchange among members by assisting in the preparation of a feasibility study for the \nproposed 190 kilometers of the 500 kV power transmission line and ancillary facilities between \nthe Lao PDR and Viet Nam, taking into account a planned 500 kV transmission line between \nThailand and the Lao PDR so as to interconnect the grids of Thailand and Viet Nam, realize the \nbenefits of power exchange, and extend economic cooperation among Lao PDR, Thailand, and \nViet Nam. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will (i) estimate the quantity of power trade between Thailand and Viet Nam \nbased on power demand and supply forecasts in each country, especially near project areas,9 \nand the different peak loads in three countries; (ii) identify the best scheme for determining the \ntransmission wheeling charge and its commercial arrangements, especially for Lao PDR\u2019s \ninvestment modalities through distributional analysis of project costs and benefits in individual \ncountries; (iii) make engineering study of options available for power exchange between Roi Et \nin Thailand and Ha Tinh in Viet Nam via the Lao PDR, including impact on the planned \ntransmission line between Thailand and Lao PDR; (iv) study in detail the best option including \ncost estimates for transmission and ancillary facilities for the proposed project; (v) conduct \neconomic  and  financial  evaluation  of  the  Project;  (vi) determine  appropriate  procurement \npackaging  and  procedures  to  facilitate  project  implementation;  (vii) determine  development \nimpact on poverty; and (viii) assess social and environmental impacts (including adequate \npublic consultations and disclosure), necessary mitigating measures, and management and \nmonitoring programs. A summary of the initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 1. \n \n12.  To implement the TA efficiently, the consultants will first estimate the quantity of power \ntrade between Thailand and Viet Nam; and identify the best scheme for determining the \ntransmission wheeling charge and tariff, including options for Lao PDR\u2019s investment modalities \nthrough distributional analysis of costs and benefits in individual countries. After the three \ncountries reach consensus at the steering committee meeting (para. 14), other necessary tasks \nfor the feasibility study will be undertaken. \n                                                 \n7  During 2002, monthly peak loads occurred in April in Thailand and December in Viet Nam. \n8  The installed capacity in 2000 was 22,300 MW for Thailand, 635 MW for Lao PDR, and 6,200 MW for Viet Nam. \nThe actual peak demand in 2000 was 14,918 MW for Thailand, 167 MW for Lao PDR, and 4,890 MW for Viet Nam. \nThe master plan study projects the peak demand in 2010 to be 28,912 MW for Thailand, 442 MW for Lao PDR, \nand 12,589 MW for Viet Nam.  \n9  Northeastern region of Thailand and northern region of Viet Nam. ", "4 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of TA is estimated at $960,000 equivalent comprising $614,000 in foreign \nexchange and $346,000 in local currency equivalent. ADB will provide $800,000 equivalent to \nfinance the entire foreign exchange cost and $186,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Governments of \nLao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam have agreed to provide on a pro rata basis $160,000 \nequivalent in local currency, consisting of services to be provided (para. 14). Details of the cost \nestimates  and  financing  plan  for  the  TA  are  in  Appendix 2. The Governments have been \nadvised that approval of the TA by ADB does not commit ADB to finance the ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be ADB and a steering committee will be its \nimplementation agency. The steering committee comprising three representatives from each \ncountry  will  be  set  up  for  overall  coordination  among  relevant  ministries  and  agencies, \nconsultants, and ADB, including extensive consultations with stakeholders and nongovernment \norganizations. Each government will appoint three representatives, including a coordinator, and \nwill assist in preparing and collecting data, participate in the steering committee meeting, and \nhelp organize the meetings as necessary. To help the consultants carry out the feasibility \nstudies in a timely manner, each government will make available a team of counterpart staff \nconsisting of representatives from the ministries and utilities concerned and arrange for the \nconcerned utility to provide office accommodation, local communication facilities, office support \nstaff, and other administrative support including  arrangements for the consultant\u2019s travel to \nproject areas. Also, each government will undertake necessary consultations and workshops \nwith  stakeholders,  project-affected  people,  and  civil  society  including  the  nongovernment \norganization, and relevant project documents will be put in a government\u2019s web site in local \nlanguages. \n \n15.  The TA will require about 17 person-months of services by a team of international \nconsultants and about 17 person-months10 from domestic consultants. The study will be carried \nout by a multidisciplinary team of experts with experience in economic and commercial aspects \nof  power  exchange  among  countries;  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  high-voltage \ntransmission networks; development and poverty impact analysis; and environmental and social \nimpact assessment of such projects. Domestic consultants will be hired to collect necessary \npower  sector  information  and  carry  out  detailed  social  and  environmental  surveys11 and \nconsultations  for  the  Project.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of the Consultants  and other arrangements for engaging domestic \nconsultants. Equipment to be financed under the TA will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. The outline terms of reference for consultants that will be required \nare in Appendix 3. \n \n16.  The TA will start in January 2004 and will be completed by December 2005.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national priority in country  Sector identified as a national priority in country poverty  \npoverty analysis?  partnership agreement? \nYes  Yes \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty: \n \nThe power sector is regarded as fundamental for poverty reduction and economic growth and development. \nWithout adequate electricity, many development outcomes cannot be achieved. The ability of governments to fulfill \neconomic development plans to support social development and off-farm job creation depends on power availability \nto support expansion of commercial and industrial activities. Electrification is regarded as so important for achieving \nother development goals that it constitutes a national goal on its own.  \n \nSecuring power supply, reducing tariffs, and increasing accessibility have significant direct and indirect \nimpacts for end-consumers, especially the poor, who generally spend a larger share of their income on electricity \nconsumption than non-poor consumers do. On the micro level lower electricity tariff reduces expenditures and brings \nabout increased socioeconomic activity resulting from increased consumption. An increase in socioeconomic activity \nwill contribute to economic growth and development.  \n \nBringing electricity to new communities and households will boost social and economic activity: improved \nability to store vaccines, increased security, longer hours of social and economic activity, and longer hours for \nchildren to study at night. Electricity also brings about increased access to information and enjoyment, improving the \nquality of life in general.   \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Proposed Poverty Classification:  \nBeneficiary nonspecific intervention \nThematic Classification:  \nEconomic growth, regional cooperation   \n     \n \nPoverty analysis will comprise assessment of the impacts on existing consumers and new consumers. It will \nfocus and on economic growth and development. It will pay particular emphasis on the ability of the poor to connect \nand benefit directly from electricity and on the affordability of up-front costs and tariffs. \n \n The development impact study of the transmission project will make use of existing studies, surveys, and \ncountry-specific and regional poverty data; and will include a poverty profile of potential project beneficiaries from the \nregional and country perspectives. The assessment will be carried out on three levels: (i) direct, (ii) indirect, and (iii) \nmacroeconomic. Mechanisms through which poverty and vulnerability of the near poor are reduced will be identified \nand subjected to qualitative and quantitative assessment. The type and extent of effects, and the mechanisms \nthrough which they take place, together with key assumptions and risks, will be summarized in a matrix to give an \noverview of the distributional impacts across key socioeconomic groups. \n  \nDirect Impacts on Poverty  \n \nThe analysis will establish a poverty profile and examine the impacts of direct access to electricity and \nassess the affordability of up-front charges and tariffs in each country. The analysis will be based on rapid field \nassessment and existing surveys and studies.  \n \nIndirect Impacts on Poverty \n \nThe study will include a review of the impact on development aspects, interlinking the project effects of \nincreased power supply with sectoral growth patterns and employment, on poverty in the identified target project \nareas at country and regional levels. It will use country-specific data, sectoral data, and socioeconomic surveys.  It \nwill examine the impact potential for sectoral growth patterns, labor absorption of unskilled versus skilled labor, and \nimplications for income and income source diversification for households across socioeconomic groups as a result of \nthe power exchange. \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nMacroeconomic Impacts on Poverty \n \nThe macroeconomic impact analysis will focus on the impact of the economic growth effect of the Project on \nthe poor and the ability of the poor to benefit from economic growth.  \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis:  Identification of the socioeconomic profile of project beneficiaries, including ethnic minorities, \nthrough participatory field appraisal. \n \nA stakeholder analysis will be an integral part of resettlement planning. For transmission and distribution line routings, \ninformation  dissemination  to  and  consultations  with  people  and  local  communities  in  affected  areas  will  be \nundertaken. The project preparatory technical assistance (TA) will include a design for a full stakeholder participation \nstrategy to be applied before and during the construction period. The strategy will include design of public information \ndisclosure about the project scope, impacts, mitigating and enhancement measures, including compensation and \nresettlement options and grievance procedures.  Local authorities have committed to assign counterpart staff to work \nwith the consultants during the TA. \n \nParticipation strategy required: Yes \u2013 for resettlement planning, implementation, and monitoring. \n \nD.
