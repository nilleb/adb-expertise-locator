INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the  central  banks  of  the  Association  of \nSoutheast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  to  realize  monetary  and  financial  integration  under  the \nASEAN Economic Community. The TA is in line with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nMidterm  Review  of  Strategy  20201 which  indicates  that  ADB  will  strengthen  financial  and \nmonetary cooperation for greater financial, fiscal, and macroeconomic stability in the region. \nThe TA  also  supports one  of the four  pillars of  the  Regional  Cooperation  and Integration \nStrategy2 which calls for supporting regional monetary and financial cooperation and integration. \nCapacity building in support of ASEAN monetary and financial integration has two aspects: (i)  \ninstitution building (e.g., with respect to regulations and market infrastructure),which needs to \ntake place within each country, and be supported through national finance sector programs; and \n(ii) development of human resources, which can be supported regionally through knowledge-\nsharing  with  peer  central  banks.3 The  TA  will  support  the  latter  through  regional  capacity \nbuilding, which complements ADB support for ASEAN capital market integration through the \nASEAN Capital Market Forum.4 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Capacity building as a prerequisite for monetary and financial integration. ADB \nhas supported ASEAN central banks since 2009 in assessing the financial landscape and \nformulating milestones for monetary and financial integration, which led to the publication of a \ncombined  study  in  2013.6 The  study  provided  (i)  threshold  conditions,  milestones,  and \nnecessary institutional arrangements for integration; and (ii) identified capacity gaps among \nASEAN member states. This led to the formation in March 2013 of the Steering Committee for \nCapacity Building Initiatives to Support ASEAN Financial Integration (SCCB) by the ASEAN \nSenior Level Committee on Financial Integration (SLC).7 ADB was asked to co-chair the SCCB, \ntogether with the South East Asian Central Banks Research and Training Centre (SEACEN).8 In \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2006. Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy. Manila. \n3  Although the TA does not focus on institution building, it is expected to lead to further discussion regarding ADB \nsupport for institution building, such as the creation of market infrastructures in Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam (CLMV) because of the need to support financial integration through \nboth human capacity building and systems to link markets. \n4  ADB.  2015.  Technical  Assistance  for  Enhancing  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  Capital  Market \nIntegration. Manila (TA $1.5 million, approved on 17 June). The TA aims to support the members of the ASEAN \nCapital Markets Forum (ACMF) and the ASEAN stock exchanges. It will (i) build the capacities of regulators from \nCLMV; (ii) support members to complete initiatives in the implementation plan; (iii) support the selected members \nto complete integration requirements that enable wider participation in implementation plan initiatives; and (iv) \nsupport ACMF and the ASEAN Secretariat in planning for deeper capital market integration after 2015, which may \ninclude revisions to the integrated ASEAN capital market scorecard, to make it more relevant and inclusive. \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 October 2015. \n6  ADB. 2013. The Road to ASEAN Financial Integration: A Combined Study on Assessing the Financial Landscape \nand Formulating Milestones for Monetary and Financial Integration in ASEAN. Manila. Available through the ADB \nwebsite, and those of ASEAN central banks. \n7  SLC, which consists of ASEAN central bank deputy governors, receives progress reports from various subsector \nworking committees including the SCCB, and evaluates the status of financial integration. Based on the evaluation, \nSLC provides guidance accordingly. \n8  SEACEN  was  established  in  1982  by  central  banks  in  Asia  to  increase  central  banking  knowledge.  The \nmembership has subsequently expanded from 8 members to 20 full members, 7 associate members, and 8 \nobservers in Asia and the Pacific. SEACEN organizes more than 20 learning programs per year. In 2014, 883 \npersons from 51 institutions participated in SEACEN programs. \n ", "2   \nrecognition of the importance of human resource capacity building, the ASEAN central bank \ngovernors requested ADB TA support for capacity building of ASEAN central banks. \n \n3.  Customized  capacity  building.  ASEAN  central  banks  have  been  committed  to \nachieving financial integration in the areas of financial services liberalization (FSL), the ASEAN \nBanking Integration Framework (ABIF), payment and settlement systems (PSSs), capital market \ndevelopment (CMD), and capital account liberalization (CAL) along with the ASEAN Economic \nCommunity in 2015 and beyond. Key milestones for ASEAN financial integration have been \nestablished by ASEAN  central banks for 2020 and 2025. In March 2015, ASEAN  finance \nministers and central bank governors announced that the immediate objective of the ABIF is to \nachieve  a  more  integrated  banking  market,  spearheaded  by  qualified  ASEAN  banks. \nImplementation  needs  to  be  accompanied  by  strengthening  of  home-host  regulatory  and \nsupervisory cooperation (i.e., narrowing gaps in regulatory and supervisory capacity that would \nprevent a central bank from effectively participating in the ABIF). To quickly narrow remaining \ncapacity gaps, SCCB organized a workshop in July 2015 to create the ABIF Learning Road Map. \nLearning  needs  were  identified,  and  a  roadmap  developed  that  starts  with  fundamental \nknowledge of financial markets and culminates with systemic issues that will be shared when \nABIF is realized. The Road Map identifies remaining capacity gaps in four layers: (i) layer 1 \naddresses the basics knowledge of financial markets, (ii) layer 2 addresses various banking-\nrelated risks, (iii) layer 3 involves banking business lines and interactions with submarkets, and \n(iv) layer 4 focuses on systemic risk and financial stability. Each layer is divided into several \nmodules. Some priority areas and remaining gaps identified in the ABIF Learning Road Map are \nrisk-based supervision, and interaction between financial products and various risks. SCCB also \nrecognized that a more flexible and customized approach is necessary to meet the specific \nneeds of Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and \nViet Nam (BCLMV), given the differences in level of market development and staff. Customized \nprograms  developed  by  SEACEN  and  tailored  bilateral  programs  provided  by  ASEAN  5 \n(Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand) central banks as peer-to-peer \nlearning  and  knowledge-sharing  were  recognized  as  valuable  and  effective  by  the  SCCB \nmembers. \n \n4.  Supplement  capacity-building activities  via  a web  portal. In the previous SCCB \nmeetings in 2014, an SCCB survey of BCLMV central bank staff indicated a large number \nwished to participate in capacity-building programs. To meet the demand for capacity building \nwith limited financial resources, SCCB has agreed to use an ADB-managed web portal as a \nrepository for learning materials created by ASEAN 5 central banks and SEACEN. ASEAN \ncentral bank staff can then access and download the material from the web portal. \n \n5.  Development of a more structured approach through additional roadmaps. The \nABIF Learning Road Map identifies steps and capacity requirements for inclusion in ABIF, and \nalso identifies capacity building demand and supply. Individuals may be unaware they lack \nspecific knowledge, but BCLMV central banks can identify specific needs through use of the \nroadmap. In addition, ASEAN 5 central banks can identify what they can provide to peer central \nbanks. Based on the Road Map, SCCB can actively engage with ASEAN central banks to match \ndemand and supply. ASEAN central bank deputy governors recognize the merits of the ABIF \nLearning  Road  Map,  and  have  asked  CAL,  PSS,  CMD,  and  FSL  working  committees  to \nconsider  similar  learning  roadmaps  for  other  areas  that  may  also  have  capacity-building \nrequirements. As co-chair of SCCB, ADB was asked to support the creation and implementation \nof  the  roadmaps  and  monitor  progresses,  together  with  SEACEN.  Thus,  this  TA  will \nsubstantially implement the ABIF Learning Road Map and develop additional roadmaps for the \nother working groups. Future direction of ADB support to ASEAN central banks will depend on \n ", "3 \n \nimplementation success and lessons learned from this TA as well as priority areas discussed \nand agreed by the ASEAN central banks and ADB through SCCB including development of new \nroadmaps. \n \n6.  Lesson from previous technical assistance. Under regional capacity development TA \nfor Assessing the Financial Landscape and Formulating Milestones for Monetary and Financial \nIntegration in ASEAN (Phase 3),9 more than 260 central bank staff of Cambodia, the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam (CLMV) were given the opportunity to \nparticipate in training organized by ASEAN 5 central banks during 2014 and 2015, with funding \nsupport by ADB.10 In addition, with the support by ADB, SEACEN organized six customized \nlearning  programs  for  BCLMV  central  banks,  with  participation  by  174  central  bank  staff \nmembers in 2014. The TA successfully narrowed knowledge and capacity gaps, but there are \nstill remaining gaps identified in the ABIF Learning Road Map. Besides, the remaining gaps are \nnot the same among the BCLMV11, thus, it was recognized that a more flexible approach to \nimplementation is needed. Under the previous TA (footnote 9), support given to CLMV central \nbank staff through the bilateral program was limited. The TA focused on  bilateral learning \nprograms that were  provided by an ASEAN 5 central bank for all CLMV central banks. A \nbilateral learning program which benefited a single CLMV central bank was thus not supported. \nADB now understands that a more tailored approach along with the ABIF Learning Road Map \nthat  focuses  on  a  single  central  bank  can  be  more  effective,  therefore,  the  proposed  TA \nprovides flexibility in supporting such bilateral programs based on the principle that financial \nsupport under the TA is provided equally and fairly to all CLMV central banks.  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be that ASEAN central banks have developed and implemented effective \nstrategies to achieve ASEAN monetary and financial integration. The outcome will be improved \ncapacity and knowledge among staff of CLMV central banks. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The  TA  supports  ASEAN\u2019s  peer-to-peer  capacity  building.  In  particular,  the  TA  will \naccommodate more flexible arrangement for bilateral learning programs developed by ASEAN 5 \ncentral banks, provided that the number of staff or amount supported by the TA is in principle \nequally distributed among CLMV central banks, which was not possible in the previous TA. The \nTA will achieve the outcome through the following three outputs. \n \n9.  Output 1: New capacity-building programs developed and conducted. In line with \nthe ABIF Learning Road Map, ASEAN 5 central banks will develop and conduct more than 35 \nnew bilateral learning programs, and train more than 280 CLMV central bank staff, with travel \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for Assessing the Financial Landscape and Formulating Milestones for Monetary \nand Financial Integration in ASEAN (Phase 3). Manila (TA 8325-REG, $750,000, approved 7 February). The TA is \nexpected to be completed by 31 December 2015. \n10 More than 40% of the TA amount was used to support travel by CLMV participants to attend bilateral training \nsessions. \n11 For example, the countries that do not have a bond market yet will need to narrow substantial gaps on market \nsurveillance. Available financial products may be different from one market to another, which requires more \ncustomized learning opportunities for various risks as included in the Layer 2 of ABIF Learning Road Map.  \n ", "4   \ncosts supported by ADB. In addition, SEACEN, with the support of ADB, will develop and \nconduct more than 10 new customized learning programs, and train more than 300 BCLMV \nstaff.12 All modules of the ABIF Learning Road Map are expected to be covered through the \nbilateral programs and SEACEN customized programs. \n \n10.  Output  2:  Use  of  web  portal  enhanced.  All  information  and  learning  resources \ndeveloped by ASEAN central banks and SEACEN will be shared through the ASEAN central \nbanks web portal, which will be managed by ADB.13 The portal will provide additional learning \nopportunities for ASEAN central bank staff, regardless of the timing and location of learning \nevents. At least 120 downloads of the resource materials on the web portal are expected. \n11.  Output 3: Additional roadmaps created. At least two new learning roadmaps will be \ncreated in addition to ABIF by ADB (through SCCB) and the working committees of CAL, PSS, \nCMD, and FSL.14 The TA will support the working committees in developing the roadmaps. \n \n12.  Risks. The risks are (i) unexpected financial shocks which may prevent execution of \ncapacity building; and (ii) high employee turnover in institutions where training is provided. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $850,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V).15 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  Based on the experience of implementing earlier TAs and ADB\u2019s role in the SCCB, ADB \nwill be the executing agency for the TA. TA implementation will be led by the Office of the \nDirector General, Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDCC), in close \ncoordination with the ADB Southeast Asia Department. TA administration and supervision, \nimplementation oversight, accountability for outputs, and communication with consultants and \nstakeholders will be carried out by SDCC. The implementation period will be 24 months, from 1 \nJanuary 2016 to 31 December 2017. \n \n15.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  in  close  coordination  with  ASEAN  central  banks  and \nSEACEN. ASEAN 5 central banks and SEACEN will provide most of the resource persons, with \nADB supporting participation by CLMV central bank staff in bilateral programs. SEACEN will \ndevelop customized learning programs for BCLMV central banks, with the support by ADB. \n \n16.  The TA will require (i) 18 person-months of individual international consultant services \nfor a capacity development expert, preferably with 10 years of experience in central banking or \nrelevant work in the region, and a wide network of resource persons that can assist with \n                                                \n12 The  cost  of  participation  in  the  SEACEN  learning  programs  will  be  supported  by  the  ASEAN\u2013Australia \nDevelopment Cooperation Program. \n13 ASEAN central banks will be given user accounts and passwords to log in to the web portal. To support smooth \ninformation sharing on regulatory issues, access to the web portal will be limited, at least initially. \n14 The CMD working committee is expected to discuss the roadmap in relation to capacity building under the ACMF, \nwhich is also supported by ADB. The FSL working committee will discuss the issue together with the insurance \ncommissions of ASEAN countries (insurance services are part of FSL discussions). The CAL and PSS working \ncommittees may develop their own learning roadmap (the members are the central banks). \n15 The Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V) funding will come from ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department \n($500,000) and the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department ($350,000). \n ", "5 \n \ncapacity building to implement learning roadmaps created by ASEAN working committees; and \n(ii)  24  person-months  of  individual  national  consultant  services  for  a  program  coordinator, \npreferably with 5 years of relevant experience in project coordination, and excellent oral and \nwritten communication skills in English. Four resource persons, for a total of 1 person-month \n(not exceeding 10 working days each), will be invited to participate in workshops and training \ncourses as lecturers or facilitators. \n \n17.  Consultants  and  resource  persons  will  be  recruited  individually,  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline \nterms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. SDCC staff will regularly monitor and \nadminister  the  individual  contracts,  and  manage  the  combined  outputs  to  achieve  the  TA \nobjectives. In the event that ADB staff act as resource persons for purposes of effectiveness, \ntravel costs will be covered by the TA, with salaries and benefits absorbed by the internal \nadministrative expense budget.16 \n \n18.  TA implementation will be monitored and evaluated at least twice per year through \ncommunication with SCCB members, and reported to the SLC for guidance. The SLC will \nevaluate the status of financial integration and readiness. If further human resource capacity \nbuilding is necessary, SLC will provide guidance to the SCCB. Learning resources will be \nshared among ASEAN central banks through the web portal, and, if agreed by ASEAN central \nbanks,  published  for  wider  use.  Training  sessions  and  workshops  funded  by  ADB  will  be \nevaluated by the participants and their central banks. An evaluation of the performance and \noutcomes will be carried out at SCCB meetings and at the conclusion of the TA, and reflected in \nthe TA completion report. \n \n19.  Equipment purchases (i.e., computer hardware and software) will be undertaken by ADB \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and in \ncoordination  with  ADB\u2019s  Office  of  Information  Systems  and  Technology  and  Office  of \nAdministrative Services, where applicable. After TA completion, any procured equipment will be \ndisposed of in compliance with the project administration instructions on administering grant-\nfinanced TA (specifically para. 68 of Project Administration Instruction 5.09). Disbursements \nunder  the  TA  project  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $850,000 on a grant basis for \nCapacity  Building  in  Support  of  Monetary  and  Financial  Integration  of  the  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n16 A  memo  from  ADB\u2019s  Budget,  Personnel,  and  Management  Systems  Department  and  Strategy  and  Policy \nDepartment (26 June 2013) provides guidance on charging costs to TA and internal administrative expense \nbudgets. It states that, for preparatory works, implementation, and administrative support, ADB staff are not eligible \nto charge corresponding salaries and benefits to the TA. However, if the TA paper clearly specifies and includes a \nprovision in its cost estimates to provide support services, such as travel and administrative expenses, then such \ncosts should be charged to the TA. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Technical Assistance is Aligned with \nASEAN central banks have developed and implemented effective strategies to achieve ASEAN monetary \nand financial integrationa (project defined) \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2018     \nCapacity and  At least 75% of bank staff  Post-learning evaluation  Unexpected financial \nknowledge among  who participated in  and survey  shocks \nCLMV central banks  learning programs applied \nTA progress report,   \nstaff improved  the knowledge and skills in \nincluding SCCB meeting \ntheir work place (2014 \nreport \nbaseline: 0) \nOutputs  By 2017     \n1.
