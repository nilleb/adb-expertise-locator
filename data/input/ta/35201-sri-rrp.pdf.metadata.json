Through \ntechnical assistance from provincial councils, LAs will apply for \nfinance from the Local Loans and Development Fund (LLDF). The \nProject  also  involves  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity \nbuilding  of  state,  provincial,  and  local  agencies  in  urban \nmanagement  and  urban  service  provision,  as  well  as  poverty \nreduction initiatives developed through stakeholder participation.     \n   \nRationale  The huge influx of mostly poor migrants into cities and towns has \noverwhelmed infrastructure systems originally designed for much \nsmaller populations. With limited infrastructure and services, the \nold  and  new  urban  centers  are  not  capable  of  adequately \nsupporting the increasing economic productivity of households. \nThe urban poor suffer disproportionately from bad environmental \nsanitation, resulting in illness caused by water- and vector-borne \ndisease. Urban service deficiencies include deteriorated roads, \ninadequate  supplies  of  potable  water,  and  poor  drainage  and \ndomestic sanitation. The vast majority of urban residents still rely \non  septic  tanks  or  have  no  sanitation  facilities;  only  23%  of \nhouseholds have sewerage connections. Uncontrolled dumping \nand low collection levels of solid waste add to these problems.       \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The expected impact of the Project is increased growth potential \nof  and  reduced  poverty  in  urban  centers  of  Sri  Lanka.  The \nexpected outcome is improved quality of life for urban residents, \nincluding the poor and the disadvantaged, and enhanced urban \nproductivity in at least 68 urban towns. \n \nCost Estimates  The estimated project cost is $66.7 million equivalent, comprising \nforeign exchange costs of $21.1 million and local currency costs \nequivalent to $45.6 million, including taxes and duties of $7.7 \nmillion.   \n   \n ", " iv \nFinancing Plan  ($ million equivalent) \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  Percent \nExchange  Currency  Cost  (%) \nAsian Development Bank  21.1  28.9  50.0  75.0 \nGovernment                    0  12.0  12.0  18.0 \nLocal Authority                  0 4.7    4.7     7.0 \nTotal  21.1  45.6  66.7  100.0 \n Source: ADB estimates. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  SDR34,496,000  {$50.0  million  equivalent}  will  be \n  provided  from  the  Special  Funds  resources  of  the  Asian \n  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term \n  including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate of 1.0% \n  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \n  thereafter. For the basic infrastructure credit line, the Ministry of \n  Finance  and  Planning  will  provide  funding  to  LLDF  through  a \n  Subsidiary Loan Agreement on terms and conditions satisfactory \n  to  ADB.  LLDF  will  transfer  the  money  partially  as  loans  and \n  partially as grants to LAs through Subloan agreement and grant \n  agreements on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. The \nsubborrowers will receive the loans at the prevailing market-based \nrate  based  on  Sri  Lanka  Inter-Bank  Offer  Rate  (SLIBOR)  12-\nmonth average. The rate will be reviewed twice every year in \nJanuary and July. \n \nPeriod of Utilization  31 October 2011 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 April 2012 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government  \n   \nImplementation  The  Ministry  of  Provincial  Councils  and  Local  Government \nArrangements  (MPCLG) will set up a project coordination unit, led by a full-time \nproject  director  with  experience  in  handling  externally  funded \nprojects and local government infrastructure issues. The unit will \n(i) consolidate the overall project implementation plan and annual \nwork plan, (ii) assist the provincial councils in implementing the \npolicy  support  program,  (iii)  monitor  and  supervise  project \nadministration and coordination activities, (iv) organize monitoring \nand  evaluation  exercises,  and  (v)  prepare  necessary  project \nreports and the project completion report.  \n \nA project appraisal unit will be established within LLDF. The unit \nwill  (i)  assist  LAs  in  meeting  the  requirements  for  funding \nactivities,  (ii)  review  the  eligibility  of  LAs  for  grant-funding  for \ninfrastructure,  (iii)  compile  annual  data  on  the  technical  and \nfinancial performance of LAs, and (iv) manage disbursements of \nfunds to LAs. \n \nIn  each  of  the  eight  provincial  councils,  at  the  office  of  the \ncommissioner  of  local  government  (CLG),  a  Subproject \ncoordination unit will be set up, headed by the CLG. The unit will ", "  v\nbe responsible for (i) preparing an annual development program \nfor the respective province; (ii) accounting for expenditures; (iii) \nimplementing  resettlement  plans  and  ensuring  environmental \nmitigation  measures  if  required;  (iv)  undertaking  the  initial \nevaluation  of  LA  Subproject  proposals;  (v)  managing  project \ndevelopment assistance available to LAs for project identification, \nfeasibility studies, and implementation; (vi) managing the funds for \nLA  support  for  the  development  of  business  plans  and  the \nfinancial and local improvement plan, (vii) providing assistance \nand  support  to  LAs  with  weak  capacity  in  implementing  civil \nworks;  (viii)  conducting  project  quality  assurance,  and \nperformance monitoring and evaluation. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement  of  goods  and  services  under  the  Project  will  be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement \nand  the  Government\u2019s  tender  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nLocal  procurement  will  be  the  preferred  mode  for  all  project \nactivities. None of the Project\u2019s civil works contracts are expected \nto exceed $500,000 in cost. Local competitive bidding procedures \nacceptable to ADB will be followed with bidding periods of at least \n21  days.  Equipment  and  materials  will  be  procured  under \ninternational competitive bidding where the estimated cost is more \nthan $500,000 equivalent, by international shopping where the \nestimated cost is between $300,000 and $500,000 equivalent and \nthrough local procurement procedures acceptable to ADB where \nthe estimated cost is $300,000 equivalent or less. Minor items \ncosting less than $100,000 equivalent may be purchased through \ndirect purchase. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting  services  are  required  to  facilitate  project \nimplementation and to strengthen the institutional, administrative, \nand financial capacities of LAs and LLDF; 236 person-months of \ninternational and 580 person-months of domestic consulting will \nbe  required.  Consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by \nAsian Development Bank and Its Borrowers, using the quality- \nand  cost-based  selection  method  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic \nconsultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The main benefits of the Project will be (i) an increasingly more \nBeneficiaries  capable and accountable local government governance system; \n(ii) a foundation for sustainable and reliable urban services; and \n(iii) improved economic and social conditions in the participating \nLAs from investments in roads, drainage, community water, solid \nwaste management, and other basic urban facilities and services \n(including sanitation).  \n \nThe  Project  will  benefit  several  groups.  Households  and \nbusinesses will benefit from a more accountable, responsive, and \nempowered  local  government,  as  well  as  directly  from \nimprovements  in  urban  services  and  investments,  and  in  the \n ", " vi \nurban environment. Elected LA governments will gain from having \ntheir legitimacy enhanced, as a result of their improved ability to \nprovide  services,  and  from  greater  financial  and  managerial \nautonomy.  The  urban  poor  will  obtain  health  and  productivity \nbenefits  from  investments  in  environmental  infrastructure \n(drainage, community water, solid waste management, etc.), as \nthey suffer disproportionately from the ill effects of the lack of such \nservices. Finally, predominantly local private contractors and their \nworkers, as well as suppliers, will benefit from the flow of more \nthan  $42.6  million  in  contracts  for  municipal  civil  works  and \nequipment over the 6 years of the Project. About 4 million people, \nthe population of at least 68 new municipalities, will benefit from  \nthe capacity-building component.    \n \nRisks and Assumptions  Given the innovative design adopted in the Project, where LAs will \nbe  responsible  for  identifying  and  preparing  Subprojects  and \nwhere the strengthened LLDF will appraise credit worthiness of \nLAs  and  viability  of  Subprojects,  inherent  risks  need  to  be \nmonitored carefully throughout project implementation. At present, \nLAs lack experience to prepare Subproject proposals for external \nfunding.  Similarly,  LLDF's  role  as  a  fully  functioning  financial \nintermediary  is  new;  in  the  past  it  served  mainly  as  a  debt \ncollector for MPCLG. Under the Project, however, the roles and \nfunctions of LAs and LLDF are expected to go through substantial \nchange.  LAs  need  to  develop  a  sense  of  ownership  for  the \nSubprojects they will develop. LLDF will have to be reborn as a \ncompetent financial intermediary to efficiently channel the financial \nresources made  available  under  the  Project  to  LAs.  Foreseen \nrisks include (i) lack of awareness and suitably qualified personnel \nin LAs and the CLG office to assume the new responsibilities; (ii) \ninsufficient  support  from  policymakers  for  the  envisaged \ntransformation of LAs and LLDF; (iii) poor performance of LAs in \nrepaying the LLDF loans, which may trigger the use of guarantees \nby provincial councils, and (iv) political interference in Subproject \nselection. These risks are mitigated to the greatest extent possible \nby (i) ensuring LLDF\u2019s readiness prior to subloan disbursement \nunder component B through a tailored institutional strengthening \nprogram  for  LLDF;  (ii)  clearly  defined  eligibility  conditions  and \nSubproject  approval  criteria;  (iii)  carefully  designed  awareness \nand capacity-building programs for LAs and provincial councils; \nand  (iv)  increased  supervision,  through  a  supporting  technical \nassistance project and regular loan review missions. \n \nSubproject selection will prioritize rehabilitation of existing basic \nurban  infrastructure  over  new  construction  involving  small-  to \nmedium-scale  civil  and  building  works  at  sites  previously  or \ncurrently used for the same or similar purposes. The Subproject \nselection criteria rules out Subprojects classified as environment \nsafeguard  category  \u201cA\u201d  or  \u201cB  sensitive.\u201d  The  Project  is  not \nexpected to result in significant land acquisition and resettlement, \nor to have adverse impact on indigenous people.  \n ", "(cid:56)(cid:48)(cid:32)(cid:111)(cid:32)(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:39)(cid:69)

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Local Government Infrastructure \nImprovement Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  Sri Lanka has a relatively high population density of 295 people per square kilometer \n(km2), greater than that of the Philippines or Viet Nam. The country\u2019s high population density is \na major factor in the Government\u2019s economic development strategy, industrialization policy, and \nsupport of medium- and small-sized towns. The current urban population is about 5 million; 1.5 \nmillion reside in Colombo. The prolonged conflict and low productivity in rural areas have had a \nsevere impact on urban centers. Many rural people fled to urban areas, which in some cases \nhave grown by 300% during the past two decades. Urban migration has converted some small \nrural towns to urban centers. On average, the urban population is growing nearly twice as fast \nas the rural population. The urban population now represents about 27% of the national total \nand is still growing rapidly, at nearly 6% per year compared with a total national population \ngrowth rate of around 1%. The degree of urbanization is projected to reach 45% by 2015.  \n \n3.  Condition of Urban Areas. With limited infrastructure and services, the old and new \nurban centers are not capable of adequately supporting the increasing economic productivity of \nhouseholds. Living conditions in urban centers are poor for most residents. The urban poor \nsuffer disproportionately from poor environmental sanitation resulting in illness caused by water- \nand vector-borne disease. Urban service deficiencies include deteriorated roads, inadequate \nsupplies of potable water, and poor drainage and domestic sanitation. Poverty incidence in \nurban areas stood at 8% in 2002. The vast majority of urban residents still rely on septic tanks \nor have no sanitation facilities; only 23% of households have sewerage connections; and of the \ntotal 58,350 km of local authority (LA) roads, 25-40% are in very poor condition and may not \nmeet national standards. Uncontrolled dumping and low collection levels of solid waste add to \nthese problems.  \n \n4.  Inadequate Local Infrastructure Services. The prolonged political situation, financial \nconstraints, and 20 years of civil strife have impeded LA provision of essential public services. \nThe difficult conditions have also hampered economic growth and poverty reduction. Major \nurban deficiencies include (i) most towns have intermittent piped water supply services provided \nby the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB); (ii) areas without piped waste \nschemes are serviced by tubewells; many are run privately or through community schemes and \nthus have different tariffs; (iii) most tertiary roads are in a complete state of disrepair; (iv) \ndrainage problems are fairly widespread; encroachment into low-lying paddy fields and river \nbasins is rampant; (v) very few LAs have a systemized waste management system; waste \ncollection is generally carried out manually, is not separated, and is dumped on public roads \ndue to lack of proper collection space; (vi) only Colombo has a piped sewerage system; and (vii) \nprimary LA health care facilities are limited due to weak capacity and financial resources.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n5.  Creation of Provincial Councils. In Sri Lanka, devolution was perceived as an exit \nstrategy from civil conflict in the north and the east. In 1987 the Government took a major \ninitiative for decentralization through the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which led to \n ", " 2 \nthe  creation  of  an  additional  tier  of  government,  the  provincial  councils,1  in  1988.  The \namendment carved out a provincial sphere of governance, specifying an area of legislative, \nexecutive,  and  financial  competence  to  be  exercised  by  the  councils.  Article  154  in  the \nConstitution contains three lists of competencies: the responsibilities of the center (Reserved \nList), the provinces (Provincial List), and an area of overlapping responsibilities (Concurrent \nList). Through this process, institutions of local self-government that had operated under a \ncentralized  system  became  a  devolved  subject  of  the  provincial  council.  The  operational \naspects, such as LA operation and administration, were assigned to the provinces. However, \nthe central Government retains powers over LAs, providing technical support for planning, \nappraisal, procurement, and management.  \n \n6.  Three  Types  of  Local  Authorities.  Sri  Lanka  has  three  types  of  LAs  under  the \nprovincial councils: (i) municipal councils constituted in cities and large towns, (ii) urban councils \nfor less urbanized areas, and (iii) pradeshiya sabhas created in periurban and rural areas. All \nthree  have  separate  enabling  laws  providing  the  legal  and  policy  environment  for  local \ngovernment institutions to operate and function. The three types of LAs are created, regulated, \nand operated by three different ordinances.  \n \n7.  Responsibility of Local Authorities. LAs, being created by Parliament, are subject to \ngeneral supervision and control by the Government through the Ministry of Provincial Councils \nand Local Government (MPCLG). Following the devolution system, the LAs are placed under \nthe provincial councils. In the present system, provincial councils cannot reduce the existing \npowers of LAs, and if necessary, LAs can be vested with additional powers. Numerous laws \nconfer powers to LAs on various aspects of local administration, such as the Local Government \nService Ordinance and the Urban Development Authority Act. The main powers and functions of \nLAs are described in their respective acts and ordinances. For example, they have the power to \nacquire land, enter into contracts, raise funds, purchase material and equipment, and employ \nstaff. But their main responsibility is to provide conveniences and well-being to the community. \nConsequently, they are responsible for providing physical infrastructure such as roads, drains, \nparks, libraries, and housing; and for promoting public health. Hence, this Project fits with the \ndecentralized system currently in place, and aims to strengthen LA powers to improve the \nprovision of basic infrastructure services in their respective areas.2 \n \n8.  Physical  Planning  and  Legal  Framework.  Seven  laws3  govern  the  existing  legal \nframework of urban planning and land management. Urban planning involves, among others, \nthe Urban Development Authority operating in UDA \u201cdeclared\u201d areas, and Board of Investment \nwith overriding powers for board-approved projects and areas.4 NWSDB is the main agency \nresponsible for water supply and manages over 75% of piped water schemes, especially areas \ndependent on NWSDB water sources. LAs operate and maintain the remaining schemes, often \nreceiving bulk treated water from NWSDB. LAs are responsible for communal water supply \n(e.g., tubewells); in some cases, to achieve full cost recovery, the water tariffs are higher than \nthe NWSDB national tariff.   \n \n                                                 \n1  Originally, nine provincial councils were organized, but in 1991, the north and east councils were suspended, and \nmerged as a single entity, resulting in eight provincial councils.  \n2  This Project will be part of ADB\u2019s ongoing support to strengthening Sri Lanka\u2019s governance, as referred to in ADB. \n2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Fiscal Management Reform Program. Appendix 14 (page 81). \nManila.  \n3 They include Urban Development Authority Law, No. 41 of 1978; Town and Country Planning Ordinance (as \namended in 2001); and Provincial Councils Act, No. 42 of 1987. \n4  Other agencies, such as Ceylon Tourist Board and Coast Conservation Department have planning authority over \ncertain territories/land use in the country.  ", "  3\n9.  Limited Local Resource Mobilization and Local Loans and Development Fund. LA \nsources of revenue, especially for recurrent expenditure, are low. In 2003, about 36% of the \ntotal recurrent revenue for municipal councils was provided as a government grant, and about \n42% in the case of urban councils and pradeshiya sabhas.5 Sources of revenue, along with \nshared  taxes  and  grants,  are  inadequate  to  meet  the  needs  of  basic  urban  infrastructure \nservices. The main revenue sources include the stamp duty levied on property and other \ntransactions, and the assessment tax levied on the deemed value of property and rents. The \nacreage tax levied by the pradeshiya sabhas is gradually decreasing, due to large tracts of land \nbeing converted to housing use. Recurrent expenditures are increasing and now represent an \naverage of 70% of total expenditures. Of these, over 40% are consumed by personnel costs. \nConsequently, spending on maintaining LA assets is a low proportion of total expenditure, and \nLAs are unable to afford new investment in basic urban services. Although provincial councils \nhave  extensive  revenue  authorities,  in  reality,  revenues  available  to  them  are  limited.  On \naverage, provincial councils\u2019 own-source revenues account for only 10% of their expenditures. \nRecurrent expenditure is financed by own recurrent revenues and from a revenue grant (block \ngrant) funded by the central Government. The Local Loans and Development Fund (LLDF) was \ncreated in 1916 to improve access to financing for local capitalized repairs. LLDF is a statutory \nbody  operating  under  MPCLG  (Appendix  2).  Its  main  functions  include  granting  and \nadministering loans for investment in LA infrastructure development and revenue-generating \nprojects. Except for MPCLG supervision and control, LLDF is not under any control or subject to \nregulations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.6  \n \n10.  Institutional  and  Staff  Capacity.  Another  factor  fundamental  to  sustainable  urban \ndevelopment is the LA institutional framework and staff capacity. LAs should be fully responsible \nand accountable for providing local services. Although Sri Lanka has a large bureaucracy, the \nlevel and quality of local staff is generally not high. In 2004, almost 1 million public servants \nwere employed by all levels of government; 63% were employed by the central Government, \n32% by provincial councils, and 5% by LAs.7 LAs need to improve their human resource \ncapabilities, particularly in financial management and technical skills to manage infrastructure \nunder its control. Except for Colombo and other larger municipal councils, LAs have few senior \nengineers, planners, or financial specialists, although the larger LAs do have midlevel technical \npersonnel. The Project will provide technical consultants to fill in the gaps and help LAs develop \nsolid Subprojects proposals. During the Project, the technical consultants\u2019 input will be gradually \nreduced; LA technical staff are expected to assume responsibility for preparing Subproject \nproposals.      \n \n11.  External Assistance and Lessons Learned. Several externally funded projects in the \narea of urban infrastructure have been implemented during the past decade (Appendix 3). The \nSustainable Cities Programme of the United Nations-Habitat and United Nations Development \nProgramme evolved into the Urban Governance Support Programme (2004\u20132005). It provided \ncapacity-building support to the Urban Development Authority and some selected municipalities. \nPilot projects in solid waste management have produced tangible progress in the areas of \ngarbage collection and communal participation, and instilled confidence in LA staff and local \ncommunities concerned. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been the major development \npartner  in  the  urban  sector  in  recent  years.  ADB\u2019s  Urban  Development  and  Low-Income \n                                                 \n5  Capital and recurrent combined: For local authorities, between 50% and 60% of total expenditure (capital and \ncurrent) is from own revenues (61% for municipal councils, 56% for urban councils, and 55% for pradeshiya \nsabhas).  \n6  As on 31 December 2004, the total amount of loans granted to LAs was SLRs377 million. LLDF keeps a margin on \ninterest to cover its overhead, thus causing no burden to the Treasury. \n7 ADB. 2004. Review of Governance and Public Management for Sri Lanka. Manila. More than 60% of provincial \nemployees are primary and secondary school teachers. \n ", " 4 \nHousing (Sector) Project8 is evaluated as satisfactory; 97% of the loan has been disbursed and \nprincipal output targets achieved. However, three of nine subsectors identified in the 24 core \nSubprojects9  were  not  subsequently  taken  up  due  to  difficulties  encountered  during \nimplementation. Commercial facilities, such as bus terminals and traffic improvements were \nprovided  and  put  into  use;  however,  other  basic  infrastructure,  such  as  water  supply  and \nsanitation components did not fully meet the expectations of the provincial councils and LAs \nconcerned.  \n \n12.  Project  Development  Process.  A  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA) \nprepared the proposed Project. A series of consultations were held with MPCLG, all eight \nparticipating  provincial  councils,  and  participating  LAs.  Project  design  incorporates  lessons \nlearned (para. 11): setting out clear plans for institutional strengthening and implementation of \nthe delivery of basic urban infrastructure that local populations actually demand and are willing \nto maintain. The Project is in line with the Government\u2019s development priorities and ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy and program (2004\u20132008) to improve infrastructure and services provision, \nparticularly water supply and sanitation. These constitute a basic human right; representing a \ncrucial  factor  in  preventing  illness  and  raising  universal  health  status.  Following  the \nstakeholders\u2019 discussion, wherein a detailed questionnaire was circulated to all LAs. Responses \nwere received from 189 LAs representing nearly two thirds of the eligible LAs. Based on the \nscores from the questionnaire and a decision by the second Steering Committee meeting, 68 \npriority  LAs  were  selected  (Appendix  4).  Local  government  capacity  building is  needed  to \nprioritize and commit investment. The most critical strategic choice made by the project design \nis to place modest capital directly in the hands of the LAs and to allow them to decide on the \nsubsectors and support them to enhance their powers to collect revenues, which falls under \ntheir existing rights.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The expected impact of the Project is increased growth potential of and reduced poverty \nin the selected LAs of Sri Lanka. The expected outcome is improved urban environments, long-\nterm improvement of the economy, and improved living conditions for the LA population outside \nColombo. The Project will (i) improve urban management, planning, and financing capacity of \nthe sector institutions, especially LAs, to ensure sustainable provision of urban infrastructure \nand services; (ii) enhance urban livelihoods; and (iii) increase Government and LA staff capacity \nfor administering urban infrastructure supply and maintenance works. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n14.  The Project will comprise three components. Component A: provincial/municipal/urban \nmanagement improvement, includes three key areas: (i) infrastructure development planning \nand financial management support to LAs (Financial and Local Improvement Plans), (ii) Project \nDevelopment Assistance (PDA) support to provincial councils, and (iii) strengthening of LLDF \nfund management. Component B: basic local government infrastructure and services delivery \nwill improve LA infrastructure and services, namely (i) community water supply; (ii) roads; (iii) \ndrainage and community sewerage; (iv) solid waste management; and (v) basic health clinics, \npublic  libraries,  and  recreational  parks  through  finance  provided  by  LLDF.  Component  C: \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 1998, Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Urban Development and Low-Income Housing (Sector) Project,  \nManila. The project was completed in June 2005; the loan account closing is expected in 2005.  \n9  Solid waste management, sites and services, and guided land development ", "  5\ncapacity building and implementation assistance covers project coordination and administration \nfor MPCLG, provincial councils, LAs, and LLDF.   \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n15.  LA Demand-Based Project. The Project represents a shift in ADB\u2019s approach from \nsupply-driven central Government-led investment to a more decentralized approach of providing \nLAs with the decision-making role. LAs will identify, design, and apply for Subproject finance to \nLLDF.  Subprojects  are  not  predefined  at  the  feasibility  study  stage.  The  aim  is  for  LAs \nthemselves to plan the improvement of their basic infrastructure and living conditions (Appendix \n5 provides the urban sector analysis). The approach shift stems from lessons learned from ADB \nand other foreign-aided projects, with the Government\u2019s decentralization initiatives. Investment \nprograms for LA infrastructure should be implemented by LAs in the interest of building capacity \nthrough learning by doing and promoting sustainable investment. Many provincial councils and \nLAs stated during the project preparatory TA that they were not involved in the design for \nbuildings and facilities provided through previous projects, because they were prioritized by the \ncentral  agency  from  Colombo.  When  a  typical  externally  financed  project  ends,  the \ninfrastructure will often deteriorate, because no budget is set aside at the LA, and the LA has no \nkeen interest in maintaining it, because those facilities were not local top priorities. In this \nProject, provincial councils and LAs will have a say in the decision making on Subproject \nidentification, formulation, and implementation. Provincial councils will have the responsibility of \nrecovering loans and interests due from their LAs and ensure repayment. Provincial councils will \nhave authority to recover/intercept funds due to any defaulting LA for repayment of loans under \nthe Project. \n \n16.  LA Infrastructure Financed by LLDF and Project Development Assistance. LLDF \nwill provide credit, which is mixture of grant and loan. The Government is strongly committed to \nLLDF as the primary vehicle for financing local infrastructure, and this Project will support \nMPCLG\u2019s efforts to strengthen LLDF to fulfill its mandate. Preliminarily financial management \nassessment and due diligence were conducted.10 Further LLDF capacity building (including a \nbusiness  plan  and  finance  operational  guidelines),  necessary  guidelines,  comprehensive \nfinancial due diligence reports, and relevant legal documents will be prepared in the early stage \nof the Project and separate TA.11 PDA will be provided to the target 68 LAs of all 8 provinces.12 \nThe consultative approach for Subproject design is the key principle for designing the Project, \nas  well  as  a  bottom-up  approach  to  strengthen  LAs  to  plan,  develop,  and  finance  urban \ninfrastructure. This will lead to the improvement of local government performance to their local \nconstituencies.  \n \nD.  Components \n \n1.  Component A: Provincial/Municipal/Urban Management Improvement \n \n17.  Component  A  will  provide  in-service  training  to  provincial  councils,  LAs,  and  LLDF \nofficials and staff. It will assist LAs in providing reference kits for provincial council and LA staff \nto  prioritize  infrastructure  Subprojects  in  their  localities,  compile  Subproject  proposal \napplications,  and  prepare  Financial  and  Local  Improvement  Plans  (FLIPs).  The  FLIPs  will \nconsider ways to improve provincial council and LA financial management as well as ensure \nsocial and environmental safeguard compliance.13 A significant part of the capacity building will \n                                                 \n10   Appendix 2 and supplementary appendixes I and J provided details.  \n11   Subject to ADB approval within 2005 \n12  However, this does not prevent other non-shortlisted LAs from attending workshops and training in the Project. \n13  These include guidance on (i) National Voluntary Resettlement Policy and Environmental Impact Assessment Law, \n(ii) resettlement framework, and (iii) Indigenous Peoples Development Framework.   \n ", " 6 \nbe contracted out to private and nongovernment entities such as universities. This component \nwill include training in basic infrastructure planning and budgeting, as well as basic engineering \n(design and supervision) skills needed by LAs/provincial councils and LLDF.  \n \na.  Local Authority Capacity Building \n \n18.   LA  Financial  and  Local  Improvement  Plan.  The  FLIP  will  be  introduced  as  a \nmechanism for LAs to identify and implement simple initiatives that can be taken up by the LAs \nwithin their existing legal and regulatory framework. Funding under the FLIP will be as a grant to \nLAs  through  their  respective  provincial  councils.  LAs  participating  in  the  Project  will  be \nencouraged  to  develop  and  adopt  an  action  plan  that  outlines  concrete  steps  with  clear \nmilestones to increase their revenue base. The FLIP will precede capital investment in the LA \nand address the issue of Subproject sustainability. The action plan will serve as the LA\u2019s \ncommitment to undertake identified reforms while it implements an infrastructure Subproject, \nduring which it has to achieve predefined milestones. The thrust of the FLIP will comprise two \ncomponents:  an  action  plan  and  milestones  for  revenue  enhancement  and  financial \nmanagement. Through an overall review of current revenue and cost analysis, LAs will develop \nan action plan and targets for improved governance and financial management based on their \nneeds. For instance, while one LA may need support to improve  tax14 administration and \nrecovery, another LA may need support for updating accounts or setting up a complaint redress \nsystem.15 MPCLG intends to replicate the FLIP initiative across LAs in Sri Lanka beyond the \nProject. LAs can also avail of a small amount of seed money for experimenting with innovative \ninitiatives for urban infrastructure and service provision, provided that those proposals have \nlinkages to LLDF financing during the Project.16  \n \n    b.  Provincial Council Capacity Building \n \n19.  In each of the eight provincial councils, the Project will provide capacity-building support \nthrough  the  office  of  the  commissioner  of  local  government  (CLG),  which  will  include  (i) \nassessment  of  LA  Subproject  implementation  performance;  (ii)  development  of  a  citizen\u2019s \ngrievance redress system on infrastructure deficiency, operation, and maintenance; and (iii) \nPDA support.  \n \n20.  Project  Development  Assistance.  Low  capacity  of  provincial  councils  and  LAs  to \nformulate, develop, and implement infrastructure projects was identified as a major impediment \nto the provision of improved services. The Project aims to provide assistance through PDA at \neach of the provincial councils, using three international TA advisers. Each adviser will cover up \nto three provincial councils. These teams of consultants will serve as a \u201chelp desk\u201d to cater to \nany need from an LA office or provincial council\u2019s Subproject coordination unit (SPCU) offices \nfor  financial  management  (including  FLIP  assistance)  and  general  day-to-day  project \ndevelopment.  Gradually,  the  expertise  and  skills  of  the  consultants  will  be  transferred  to \nprovincial  council  staff,  with  consultant  input  being  reduced  by  50%  during  project \nimplementation. Provincial council staff will be able to take over the support function for LA \nproject development. A user-friendly operations manual will be prepared for use by the borrower \nLAs and the evaluator, i.e., LLDF. Details, which cover eligibility criteria, borrowing capacity, \nflow of funds, conditions in subloan and grant agreements, and procurement guidelines will be \nincluded. At each provincial council, a funding pool will be set up for hiring international and \nnational advisers. Provincial councils will develop a consultant roster comprised of mostly local \n                                                 \n14  For example, property tax, land tax, and stamp duty (para. 9).  \n15  A FLIP will have a shortlist of easily verifiable standard performance indicators against which the participating LAs \nwill be evaluated for eligibility under component B.  \n16  Separate criteria for \u201dcommunity innovation funding\u201d will be set up in the first year through FLIP assistance. The \nFLIP formulation and implementation plans are the most important conditions for this funding.  ", "  7\nexperts,  such  as  university  faculty  (e.g.,  urban  planning  and  infrastructure  design)  and \nprofessional members (e.g., chartered engineers and accountants). The prepared proposals will \nbe screened by the provincial councils, be subject to provincial council endorsements, and be \nsubmitted to LLDF. Although the provincial councils will manage PDA, the LAs will be the \nprimary beneficiaries.  \n \nc.  LLDF Strengthening \n \n21.  Assistance to LLDF. The role of LLDF under the Project is (i) to provide financial \nresources  to  LAs  for  small-  and  medium-sized  infrastructure,  equipment,  and  consulting \nservices;  (ii)  to  examine  LA  capacity  to  plan,  implement,  and  manage  basic  infrastructure \ninvestments, and to integrate the associated expenditures (LA contributions to the investment, \noperation, and maintenance costs) and revenues into their budgets; and (iii) to enhance LLDF \nitself to develop a solid foundation for a sustainable, expandable LA infrastructure financing \nmechanism. To initiate this process, LLDF will have to prepare a time-bound business plan for \nperformance  improvement  of  existing  functions,  and  strengthen  its  capacity  as  the \nGovernment\u2019s primary financial intermediary (as defined in ADB\u2019s Operation Manual D6/OP of \n23 December 2003) in the LA infrastructure finance sector in Sri Lanka.17 This will include \npreparation of an operations manual outlining credit and grant appraisal requirements, and \nfinancial projections. A preliminary financial management assessment and financial analysis \nfound LLDF to be financially sound.18 LLDF has a very low administration cost on lending. Upon \ncompletion of a business plan, operational manual, codes of conduct, and associated model \nagreements; and once the project appraisal unit is set up; ADB will field a review mission to \nassess the readiness of LLDF to commence financing operations under component B. \n \n22.  Study on a Future LLDF Role. Once component B disbursement is on track according \nto  the  projected  schedule,  special  studies  will  be  conducted  for  developing  a  credit-rating \nmechanism  to  evaluate  the  creditworthiness  of  LAs.  This  may  expand  to  developing  and \nmanaging  a  separate  grant  window  for  non-revenue-generating  projects  and  treasury \nmanagement and credit enhancements, such as provincial guarantees, escrows, and debt-\nservice reserve funds as potential future functions of LLDF.   \n \n2.  Component B: Basic Local Government Infrastructure and Service Delivery  \n \n23.  For component B investments, each LA, with guidance and support from its provincial \ncouncil,  will  prepare  a  Subproject  application  comprising  a  package  of  infrastructure \nimprovements. After LLDF approves a Subproject application (para. 41), the LA will receive a \nmixture of grant and loan from LLDF for infrastructure and service delivery. Sector details, \ndetailed selection criteria, and Subproject appraisal process are given in Appendix 4. The \nfollowing components will be eligible for financing under each Subproject:  \n \na.  Community Water Supply \n \n24.  The Government aims to achieve full water supply for the population by 2010. The World \nBank estimates that around 98% of the urban population and 70% of the rural population has \naccess to safe water. However, studies undertaken in the project preparatory TA reveal that \n                                                 \n17  A separate advisory TA will be provided for LLDF to reorient its functions and operations in view of the new \nresponsibilities mandated under the Project. A new business plan as well as a comprehensive operations manual \nwill be developed for approval by LLDF\u2019s board. The manual will include (i) a lending policy on which component B \nwill be disbursed, and (ii) a human resource strategy upon which the recruitment of new staff members will be \nbased. Once the overall operational framework is developed under the TA and new staff recruited, additional \ncapacity building will be provided under the Project (component A).   \n18  Supplementary appendixes H and I.  \n ", " 8 \naccess to safe drinking water range from 10% to 55% in most LAs. Only a few schemes operate \n24 hours a day, and most schemes provide service ranging from a few hours every other day to \n12 hours a day. This intermittent service is frequently due to a lack of water resources, or \ninadequate expansion of the scheme to meet demand. The main technical options for water \nsupply under the Project are (i) groundwater wells with hand pumps, (ii) rainwater harvesting, \n(iii) piped systems with overhead tank, and (iv) gravity pipe system. Typically, 20\u201350% of the \nlocal population in a town do not have water supply services. Extension and rehabilitation of the \nexisting piped supply, and construction of new schemes as appropriate to serve the remaining \n20\u201350% of the unserved population through both spring and tubewell sources, will be part of \nthis subcomponent.19 \n \nb.  Local Authority Roads \n \n25.  LAs  are  responsible  for  construction  and  maintenance  of  class  D,  E,  and  other \nunclassified roads, which are primarily tertiary roads.20 Generally, tertiary roads are of poor \nquality, with the degree of quality inversely related to the class; almost all LAs lack technical and \nfinancial resources. The Subprojects will include rehabilitation and repair of existing roads within \nthe urban core area and improvement of traffic management. Provincial councils will take a lead \nrole  in  developing  and  implementing  the  works  for  intermunicipality  road  link  (class  D) \nimprovements across neighboring LA boundaries. The Project will prioritize rehabilitation of \nexisting gravel roads over new road construction.  \n  \nc.  Local Authority Drainage and Communal Sewerage \n \n26.  Drainage  problems  are  fairly  widespread.  With  the  increase  in  urbanization  more \nsurfaces are paved and impermeable areas are enlarged, thus increasing both the volume and \npeak rate of runoff. Older drains and culverts are inadequate and need to be expanded and \ncapacity increased. Low-lying towns experience the worst problems, but even LAs in hill areas \nreport problems. Equipment needs are frequently cited. Improved urban planning is fundamental \nto solving drainage and flood control problems, with work including (i) elimination of blockages, \nobstructions, and encroachments on existing drainage paths; (ii) construction of new drains to \nserve previously unserved areas; and (iii) construction of missing links. Some municipalities \nmay opt for repair and improvement of existing sanitation systems. Most LAs rely on septic \ntanks and pit latrines because construction of proper sanitation facilities is difficult due to high \nwater tables and rock outcrops. Poor conditions reflect institutional problems and insufficient \nawareness of the importance of a clean and pleasant environment for sound livelihood, tourism, \nand other socioeconomic interests.   \n  \nd.  Solid Waste Management \n \n27.  Solid  waste  management  services  are  generally  available  in  urban  areas,  but  in  a \nmanner that is rudimentary, unsightly, and potentially hazardous to health and the environment, \nespecially in low-income areas. Lack of disposal facilities is critical in most LAs. Solid waste \nmanagement  systems  supported  by  the  Project  will  need  to  be  consistent  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s recently adopted National Solid Waste Management Strategy. This component \nwill improve collection efficiencies of household wastes and other (commercial, institutional, and \nhazardous medical) wastes within the core urban areas, and ensure improved arrangements for \ndisposal.21   \n \n                                                 \n19  Tariffs will be levied at full cost recovery (recurrent from outset, and capital overtime) for community water supply.  \n20  The Road Development Authority is responsible for the national highway network (category A) and some category \nB roads.   \n21  A solid waste collection and disposal tariff will be levied for full cost recovery.  ", "  9\ne.  Basic Health Clinics, Pubic Libraries, and Recreational Parks \n \n28.  Small municipal facilities to be provided under this component will be identified through \nintensive consultation between the LA and the local population during implementation. This \ncomponent will be developing basic health clinics; public libraries; small recreation parks; and \nLAs institutional infrastructure with ADB\u2019s prior approval  \n \n  3.  Component C: Project Coordination and Administration Support \n \n29.  This component will cover incremental administration costs and counterpart staff of \nMPCLG, provincial councils, and LAs. It will also include some consulting services to (i) provide \nadministration  and  coordination  support  to  the  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  for \nimplementation of project components, including the development and implementation of the \nproject performance management system (PPMS); (ii) assist SPCUs in supporting the LAs to \nbuild  project  awareness;  (iii)  strengthen  the  national  steering  committee  (NSC);  and  (iv) \nimplement  and  enhance  community  development  strategies,22  particularly  for  prioritizing \nSubprojects and maintaining infrastructure.23 \n \nE.  Cost Estimates \n \n30.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $66.7 million equivalent (including taxes of \n$7.7 million), of which $ 21.1 million (31.6%) is the foreign exchange cost including $1.3 million \nin  interest  charges  during  construction,  and  $45.6  million  equivalent  (68.4%)  is  the  local \ncurrency cost.

Percentage will    \ndecrease from 12% in 2005 to 5.0% in 2009 and beyond.  \nd Taxes are computed on the import duty on various items, which varies from 10% to 20%, and a value-added tax of \n15% on local goods and services.   \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n                                                 \n22  Community consultation initiatives will refer to lessons learned and experiences from the United Nations-Habitat\u2019s \nSustainable Cities Program, which developed a tool kit on this subject, particularly focusing on solid waste \nmanagement (United Nations-Habitat and United Nations Development Programme. 2003. Tools to Support \nParticipatory Urban Decision Making. Colombo).       \n23  Participatory  mechanisms  embedded  in  the  Project  are  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  initiative  for \ndecentralization and participatory governance.   \n ", " 10 \nF.  Financing Plan \n \n31.  The Government has requested a loan of SDR34,496,000 ($50.0 million equivalent) \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 32-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The ADB loan represents 75.0% of the total cost of the \nProject and will cover the entire foreign exchange cost of $21.1 million (including interest and \nother charges amounting to $1.3 million), and $28.9 million equivalent, or 63.3%, of the local \ncurrency cost. The local currency cost to be financed by ADB will cover portions of the civil \nworks and equipment, consulting services, and project implementation support, but excludes \nduties and taxes estimated at $7.7 million. ADB's financing of local currency expenditure is \njustified by the nature of the Project, which will address local poverty and economic growth \nwithin the project areas and the entire country. The Government and LAs will provide local \ncurrency financing of $16.7 million equivalent, or 25.0% of the total project cost24 to cover part of \nthe cost of civil works, consulting services, and counterpart staff required for the proposed \ncentral PCU and SPCUs. The proposed financing plan is summarized in Table 2.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plana  \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local     \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Total Cost  Percent \nAsian Development Bank  21.1  28.9  50.0   75.0 \nGovernment of Sri Lanka    0.0  12.0  12.0    18.0 \nLocal Authorities    0.0    4.7    4.7      7.0 \n  Total  21.1  45.6  66.7  100.0 \na The allocation of loan proceeds in the loan agreement will be presented in the special drawing right equivalent of \nUS dollars. With reference only to total expenditure, in accordance with ADB. 2005. Cost Sharing and Eligibility of \nExpenditure for Asian Development Bank Financing: A New Approach. Manila. \n        Source: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n32.  The Government will relend the LLDF credit line portion of the loan equivalent to $42.6 \nmillion in both foreign exchange and local currency in accordance with the subsidiary loan \nagreements with the terms and conditions and implementation arrangements satisfactory to \nADB. Onlending terms from the Government to LLDF is the same rate as that applicable to ADB \nloans. Conditions for the credit line are detailed in para. 42. As LLDF is a primary purpose \ndevelopment finance institution, designed to provide finance to local government authorities in a \nsustainable fashion and at interest at market-based rates, it will not cause market distortions; \nthis demand cannot be met through domestic financial systems. As the Project will be providing \nmostly non-revenue-generating infrastructure, e.g., roads and drainage, release of the grant \ncomponent is justified. The relending interest on the loan portion will enable LLDF to repay the \ngrant portion to the Government. Procurement and repayment requirements will be compiled in \ndetail in the LLDF operational guidelines to be developed in component A.  \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  National Arrangements  \n \n33.  MPCLG will be the Executing Agency. An interministerial NSC, chaired by the secretary \nof  MPCLG,  will  be  established  to  oversee  the  Project,  and  include  representatives  of  the \n                                                 \n24  Assessment of some LA financial standing records indicates that they have the ability to meet their counterpart \nfinancing requirements (supplementary appendix H). The FLIP will also examine each LA\u2019s capacity to shoulder \nthe counterpart funding.  ", "  11\nMinistry of Finance and Planning (MoFP), External Resources Department, National Planning \nDepartment, Finance Commission, Department of National Budget, Foreign Aid Utilization and \nBudget  Monitoring  Department,  Ministry  of  Urban  Development  and  Water  Supply  (Urban \nDevelopment  Authority  and  NWSDB),  Central  Environmental  Authority,  National  Physical \nPlanning Department, LLDF, provincial chief secretaries, urban councils, pradeshiya sabhas, \nand civil society; chairpersons of the Association of Municipal Councils; and the project director \nof the PCU (member secretary). The NSC will be established and hold its first meeting within 3 \nmonths of the effectiveness date of the Project. The NSC will meet at least once every 6 months \nto review project progress and guide future direction of the Project. \n \n34.  MPCLG will set up a PCU, led by a full-time project director with experience in handling \nexternally funded projects and local government issues. The project director will be charged \nexclusively with project execution and have no other duties within MPCLG. The project director, \nsupported by the PCU, will coordinate activities under the Project; and be directly responsible \nfor overall project quality, monitoring and supervision, and reporting. Overall implementation \narrangements are in Appendix 7. Based on the financial management assessment and ADB's \nprevious experience with MPCLG, financial management arrangements for components A and \nC are deemed sufficient.  \n \n35.  The PCU will (i) consolidate the overall project implementation plan and annual work \nplan, (ii) assist the provincial councils and LAs in implementing the capacity-building program, \n(iii) monitor and supervise project administration and coordination activities, (iv) lead monitoring \nand evaluation exercises, and (v) prepare quarterly project reports and the project completion \nreport.  The  project  director  will  be  supported  by  a  full-time  compliance  officer  (legal, \nprocurement,  documentation,  environment,  and  social  compliance),  senior  accountant,  and \nadministrative staff (supplemented by consultants as necessary).  \n \n36.  For component B implementation, a Project Appraisal Unit (PAU) will be established \nwithin LLDF. The unit will (i) assist the provincial councils in meeting requirements for funding \nactivities, (ii) review the eligibility of LAs and grant-funded activities, (iii) compile annual data on \nthe technical and financial performance of the LAs, and (iv) manage disbursements of funds to \nthe LAs. The unit will be staffed by a fund manager with economic/financial background, a civil \nengineer, an environment and/or social development specialist, and accountants. The LLDF \nBoard will approve the operation guidelines, business plan, and other documents and financial \nreports to be prepared and compiled through LLDF capacity building in component A. The \nBoard will review annually the performance of LLDF and the participating LAs. The existing \nBoard of Commissioners will be expanded to include one representative from the civil society \nnominated by the provincial councils. An initial financial management assessment of LLDF \nidentified areas to be strengthened prior to commencing financing operations under component \nB; as such the financial management arrangements for this component are deemed sufficient. \nThe PAU will operate under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer of LLDF and will liaise \nwith the Project Director on a regular basis, at least quarterly. \n \n2.  Provincial Arrangements  \n37.  In each of the provincial councils, at the CLG office, an SPCU will be set up. The SPCU \nwill  be  headed  by  the  CLG,  supported  by  a  full-time  accountant,  civil  engineer,  assistant \nengineer,  and  support  staff.  In  addition  a  part-time  financial  management  specialist  and \ncompliance officer will be available. Staffing will be supplemented by consultants (including \nsocial development/environment expert) as necessary. The SPCU will be responsible for (i) \n ", " 12 \npreparing an annual development program for the respective province;25 (ii) accounting for \nexpenditures;  (iii)  implementing  resettlement  plans  and  ensuring  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures if required; (iv) undertaking the initial evaluation of Subproject proposals from LAs; (v) \nmanaging PDA; (vi) maintaining and managing funds for LA support for developing business \nplans and implementing the FLIP; (vii) assisting and supporting LAs with weak capacity in \nimplementing  civil  works;  and  (viii)  conducting  project  quality  assurance,  and  performance \nmonitoring and evaluation. The number of technical staff deputed from the CLG office to the \nSPCU will depend on the size of the province and the workload of the Subprojects.26 Training of \nSPCU  staff  will  be  organized  at  the  beginning  of  the  Project  for  civil  works,  Subproject \nappraisals, environmental and social safeguards, contract management, and regular project \nadministrative responsibilities. A provincial steering committee will be set up in each of the eight \nprovinces to provide overall strategic guidance and coordination support. The chief secretary of \nthe province will chair the provincial steering committee and members will include the CLG of \nthe province (member secretary), Secretary of the Provincial Local Government Ministry; district \nsecretaries; regional representatives of the Central Environment Authority, NWSDB, and Urban \nDevelopment  Authority;  and  the  chairpersons  of  selected  LAs.  Each  SPCU  will  have  an \naccounting  section,  directly  under  the  CLG,  to  deal  with  procedural  aspects,  recording  of \nfinancial transactions, and preparation of liquidation statements and replenishment requests to \nLLDF. At least 50% of the SPCU staff should be mainstreamed by provincial councils before the \ncompletion of the Project.  \n \n3.  Subproject Appraisal   \n \n38.  Participating LAs, based on stakeholder consultations and community prioritization, will \nidentify Subprojects and submit them to the CLG at their respective provincial council. The \nSPCU under CLG, at the provincial council will check the Subproject for (i) any coordination for \na joint proposal with another (or more) LA(s) (e.g., roads, solid waste), (ii) needs of the local \ncommunities, (iii) financial and economic feasibility, (iv) environmental and social impacts, (v) \npreferred government strategy, and (vi) sustainability. If the Subproject does not satisfy all \ncriteria on technical grounds, the SPCU can help the LA identify a technical expert from the \nconsultants  on  the  roster.  The  SPCU  under  CLG,    will,  on  behalf  of  the  LA,  submit  the \ncompleted application to LLDF. LLDF will be responsible for appraising the Subproject. In \naddition to assessing the technical feasibility and financial affordability/sustainability, LLDF will \nlook at regional balance and past performance of the LA. Once LLDF approves the Subproject, \nthe provincial council or the LA will give a call for tenders. ADB will  assess the first two \nSubprojects from each of the five subsectors. Then ADB will only review Subprojects valued at \nmore than $500,000. Each SPCU will have a tender board, which will evaluate all tenders and \ngive the final award. For each Subproject approved by LLDF, the LA will assign a focal person \nwithin the LA office to look after location-specific information at the SPCU for design and \nsupervision of the civil works. Details of Subproject selection, appraisal, and tendering are in \nAppendix 4.    \n \n4.  Principles to Guide Operation of Project Funds  \n \n39.  The principles for operation of the project funds under component B include (i) a regional \nbalance for infrastructure funding will be maintained through a predefined transparent allocation \nprocess (para. 39 and Appendix 4); (ii) Subprojects must comply with predefined appraisal \ncriteria for each sector and must be limited to identified services; (iii) Subprojects selected must \n                                                 \n25  This serves as the basis for LAs to explore joint submission for any local infrastructure that would stretch beyond \nthe boundaries of an LA (e.g., road, drainage, or solid waste).  \n26  As a minimum, the SPCU will need staff capable of appraising the Subprojects on technical grounds (e.g., water, \nroad, drainage, etc.).     ", "  13\nform part of the functions devolved to LAs, and be under the line function of the LAs; (iv) an \noverall balance must be maintained at each province for the various categories of LAs with up to \n50% funding available for pradeshiya sabhas; (v) all funding to LAs will be in addition to the \nexisting central support; (vi) the grant component to LAs will be 40% municipal council, 50% \nunion council, and 60% pradeshiya sabhas, of the project cost; (vii) the maximum cumulative \nborrowing for individual LAs will be restricted to twice its own revenues; (viii) loans to LAs will be \ngiven by provincial councils with provincial guarantees; (ix) the LA contribution must be a \nminimum 7% of the overall cost of each Subproject, (x) investment in an individual subsector is \nnot to exceed 30% of total infrastructure funding in each province; the minimum investment in \neach subsector is to be at least 5% of the overall funding; (xi) representation of all provinces \n(except Colombo district) is to be ensured; and (xii) incremental revenues of LAs must not be \nset against a reduction in block grants or other funds due from provincial councils or against an \nincrease in recurring expenditure. \n \n5.  Fund Flow Mechanism \n \n40.  MPCLG will receive the funds from MoFP; this will include the entire amount received \nfrom ADB and the counterpart Government funding. The funding for components A and C, \nwhich will equal $10.2 million, will flow directly from MPCLG as a grant to the provincial councils \nand LLDF. LAs will receive their grants for FLIP development and implementation and PDA \nthrough the provincial councils. Depending on the tender cost, the provincial councils or the LAs \nwill place the call for tenders. The total allocation for each provincial council (component A) will \nbe decided based on its population and poverty figures. \n \n41.  LLDF  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  loan  disbursement  and  recovery  for \ncomponent B of the Project. LLDF will receive $42.6 million as a loan from the Government on \nthe same borrowing terms as disbursed by ADB to the Government. The Government will bear \nthe foreign exchange risk. The entire ADB loan is to be repaid to the Government after an 8-\nyear grace period, in 24 equal annual installments as per the back-to-back arrangement with \nADB. LLDF will disburse the funds received from the Government (through MPCLG) as part \ngrant and part loan as defined for the various categories of LAs. More than 60% of the funds will \nbe channeled to LAs through LLDF as grants.27 LLDF will set up a revolving fund generated by \nrepayments from LAs on their borrowed loan portions. LLDF will reinvest the money received \nand will repay the Government over 32 years. Preliminary financial projections indicate that \nLLDF  will  be  financially  self-sufficient  under  these  arrangements.  Details  of  disbursement \narrangements at LLDF and the LAs are outlined in Appendix 4. LLDF will transfer funds to LAs \nfor approved Subprojects on a 6-month projection basis; the funds may be liquidated on a \nstatement-of-expenditure basis. Depending on the tender cost, tenders for civil works will be \ncalled by the provincial councils or the LAs.  \n \n6.  Capacity Assessment for the LAs to Borrow \n \n42.  Most Subprojects under the Project are not revenue generating in nature and will need \nto be considered against the overall LA financial capacity.28 Under the Project, LAs will be \nsupported to develop detailed FLIPs to increase their own-source revenue to repay the loan \nportion and strengthen financial discipline. Under the FLIPs, LAs will target average annual \n                                                 \n27  The loan component will have a 12-year term and a 2-year grace period for principal repayment. It will be repaid in \n40 equal quarterly installments thereafter; the market rate is to be charged on outstanding loans from LAs. The rate \nwill be Sri Lanka Inter-Bank Offer Rate (SLIBOR) 12 months. \n28  Para. 15 describes the provincial council guarantee, in case of LA default on repayment.  \n ", " 14 \nincreases of 10% in their own-source revenues.29 To mitigate risks of an LA being unable to \nrepay the loan and interest amounts, the maximum loan given will not be more than two times \nthe own-source revenue of the respective LA. In addition, a provincial guarantee for repayment \nwill be obtained against each LLDF loan. Initial assessment of the financial viability of loan and \ninterest repayment of the LA with two sample LAs show positive results. The Project will ensure \nthat the initiatives taken through this Project will be sustained by (i) LAs ensuring their transition \nto more transparent and plan-based organization through the FLIP, (ii) building capacity of \nprovincial council and LA staff, and iii) allocating the LLDF loan on a performance basis. LA \nperformance will be constantly assessed by LLDF before financing is provided for a second \nloan,  thus  incentives  will  encourage  LAs  to  strive  for  better  efficiency  in  delivery  and \nmaintenance of infrastructure.   \n \n7.  Implementation Period \n \n43.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years. Implementation is expected to commence \nin the first quarter of 2006. Start-up activities will include appointment of the project director; \nestablishment of the NSC and provincial steering committees; recruitment of project staff (PCU \nand  SPCU),  consultants,  and  technical  advisers;  preparation  of  training  manual;  and \nprocurement of immediately required equipment. The project implementation schedule is in \nAppendix 8.  \n \n8.  Procurement \n \n44.  Procurement of goods and services under the Project will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and the Government\u2019s tender procedures acceptable to \nADB.  Local  procurement  will  be  the  preferred  mode  for  all  project  activities.  None  of  the \nProject\u2019s civil works contracts are expected to exceed $500,000. Local competitive bidding \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  followed  with  bidding  periods  of  at  least  21  days. \nEquipment and materials will be procured using international competitive bidding where the \nestimated cost is more than $500,000 equivalent, international shopping where the estimated \ncost  is  between  $300,000  and  $500,000  equivalent,  and  local  procurement  procedures \nacceptable to ADB where the estimated cost is $300,000 equivalent or less. Minor items costing \nless than $100,000 equivalent may be purchased through direct purchase. \n \n9.  Consulting Services \n \n45.  Consulting  services  (236  person-months  of  international  and  580  person-months  of \ndomestic consultants) are required to facilitate project implementation and to strengthen the \ninstitutional, administrative, and financial capacities of the LAs and LLDF. Consultants will be \nneeded for components A and C. Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by the Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic \nconsultants, using a quality- and cost-based selection method. The proposed consultant input in \ncomponents A and C is described in Appendix 9.30 Of component A consultancies, PDA support \nto the SPCUs (A-2), support to LLDF and (A-3), and component C: PCU coordination and \nadministration support will be engaged through a firm.  \n \n46.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the Government \nand  MPCLG.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \n                                                 \n29  Thorough analysis of existing LA\u2019s tax base can be achieved, particularly by strengthening (i) assessment rate, (ii) \nservice tax, and (iii) stamp duty. Appendix 2 (paras. 30\u201333) provides more details.   \n30  Terms of reference for consultants are available in Supplementary Appendix A.  ", "  15\ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n10.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n47.  To ensure the timely release of loan proceeds and to expedite project implementation, \nan imprest account will be established at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka for MPCLG, promptly \nafter  loan  effectiveness.  The  initial  amount  will  be  no  more  than  a  6-month  projected \ndisbursement, or 10% of the Loan, whichever is less. The imprest account will be established, \nmanaged, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed \narrangements agreed upon by ADB and the Government. Statement of expenditure procedures \nmay be used to reimburse eligible expenditures not exceeding $50,000 per payment, and to \nliquidate advances made into the imprest account in accordance with the guidelines. MPCLG \nwill  coordinate  the  timely  release  of  funds.  A  second  generation  imprest  account  will  be \nestablished  for  LLDF.  The  initial  amount  will  be  no  more  than  a  6-month  projected \ndisbursement, or $1 million, whichever is less. Auditors satisfactory to ADB will audit the use of \nthe imprest account and SOE procedures. A separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest \naccount and SOE procedures will be included in the annual audit report.    \n \n11.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n48.  The PCU, SPCUs, and LLDF will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to \nidentify financing resources they receive and expenditures made on the Project, including the \ngoods, works, and services financed by the loan proceeds and local funds. These project \naccounts and related financial statements will be audited annually in accordance with sound \nauditing standards by auditors acceptable to ADB. The Government will submit annual audited \nreports and related financial statements to ADB within 6 months after the end of each fiscal \nyear. LLDF will be subject to annual audit, and in addition to the audited project accounts, ADB \nwill receive a copy of the audited financial statements of LLDF. The audit of imprest accounts \nand statement of expenditures will be carried out as part of the annual audit, with the auditor\u2019s \nopinion of that part separately set out in the auditor\u2019s report.31  \n \n49.  The PCU and SPCUs will prepare brief progress reports each month. Project activities \nwill be similarly reported in separate monthly reports. Subproject completion reports, which \nidentify project impact, will be prepared for each Subproject. Within 3 months of the physical \ncompletion of the Project, the Government will submit to ADB an overall project completion \nreport providing a detailed evaluation on the impact on the beneficiaries. \n \n12.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n50.  To  ensure  that  Subprojects  are  managed  efficiently  and  that  project  benefits  are \nmaximized, ADB developed the Project Performance Management System Handbook. The \nsystem will establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the Project and its impact. The \nProject\u2019s PPMS will also be set up in accordance with the ADB handbook and the project \nobjectives. The PPMS will comprise (i) Subproject baseline data and output targets set up \nduring the FLIP and Subproject implementation manual preparation within component A; (ii) \n                                                 \n31  During the ADB tsunami emergency loan inception mission, the Audit General\u2019s Office indicated that it often does \nnot receive financial information in time, creating difficulty with the 6-month audit deadline. ADB will request that \nunaudited financial information be prepared 3 months from the end of the fiscal year and be available for audit. \n ", " 16 \ncomprehensive implementation-related performance dully collected and recorded by LLDF and \nthe SPCUs, which is periodically audited by the PCU; and (iii) postcompletion performance and \nimpact data collected by the PCU (MPCLG). The system will establish a set of monitorable \ntargets and indicators. Baseline and impact data will be disaggregated by provincial council, LA \nsize,  and  other  dimensions  to  be  discussed  during  project  inception.  Implementation \nperformance monitoring will integrate financial and nonfinancial aspects. The PCU will establish \nan effective PPMS within 1 year of the effective date.   \n \n13.  Project Review \n \n51.  Besides the regular performance review and evaluation carried out by the PCU and \nSPCUs, ADB will review the Project twice a year to assess implementation progress. This will \nbe complemented by an extensive internal project monitoring process, from self-monitoring by \nparticipating communities, up through the SPCUs and LLDF. A review mission (using one of the \nannual review missions) will be fielded when LLDF operational guidelines, business plan, and \nother  necessary  rule  and  financial  due  diligence  reports  are  finalized.  Component  B  will \ncommence  when  the  review  result  is  deemed  satisfactory.  In  addition,  a  comprehensive \nmidterm review will be carried out by the Government, the PCU, SPCUs, and ADB after 3 years \nfrom commencement. The midterm review will (i) review the scope, design, and implementation \narrangements of the Project; (ii) identify changes needed since the time of project appraisal; (iii) \nassess  implementation  performance  against  project  indicators;  (iv)  review  and  establish \ncompliance with loan covenants; and (v) identify problems and constraints, and if necessary \nrecommend changes in the design or implementation arrangements. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Expected Project Benefits and Impacts \n \n52.   The  main  benefits  of  the  Project  will  be  (i)  an  increasingly  more  capable  and \naccountable local government governance system; (ii) a foundation for sustainable and reliable \nurban  services  through  more  effective  LA  management  and  finance;  and  (iii)  improved \neconomic and social conditions in the participating LAs from investments in roads, drainage, \ncommunity water, solid waste management, and other small-scale community facilities. \n \n53.  The Project will benefit several groups. Households and businesses in LAs will benefit \nfrom a more accountable, responsive, and empowered local government, as well as directly \nfrom improvements in urban services and investments, and in the urban environment. Elected \nLA governments will gain from enhancement of their legitimacy, as a result of improved ability to \nprovide services and from greater financial and managerial autonomy. The urban poor will \nobtain health and productivity benefits from the investments in environmental infrastructure, as \nthey  suffer  disproportionately  from  the  ill  effects  of  the  lack  of  such  services.  Finally, \npredominantly local private contractors and their workers, as well as suppliers, will benefit from \nthe flow of more than $42 million in contracts for municipal civil works and equipment over the 6 \nyears of the Project. At least 4 million people, the total population of at least 68 municipalities, \nwill benefit from changes in the legal and institutional framework and from the capacity-building \ncomponent. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10.  \n \n54.  Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples. The Project provides direct social benefits \nthrough increased access to basic urban infrastructure and services, and enhances the potential \nfor investments and economic growth in poor areas. The Project is not expected to result in \nsignificant  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  Subproject  selection  criteria  ensure  that \nSubprojects resulting in significant resettlement will not be part of the Project. Further, the \nProject will prioritize rehabilitation of existing basic urban infrastructure over new construction. ", "  17\nWhere land acquisition is required, the use of Government land will be preferred, avoiding \nprivate  land  in  Subproject  siting  and  alignment.  If  any  land  acquisition  and  involuntary \nresettlement  will  be  required  in  Subprojects,  the  Government  and  LLDF  will  follow  the \nresettlement framework. The Project will monitor the LA decision-making process to ensure that \ndecisions  are  reached  in  a  participatory  manner,  and  no  vulnerable  groups  are  adversely \nimpacted by Subprojects. Project design includes an indigenous peoples framework to ensure \nproject benefits are equally shared, should a Subproject have impacts on indigenous peoples. \n \n55.  Environment. The Project is classified as \u201cFI,\u201d in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy (2002). An environmental assessment of financial intermediation loans was prepared. \nSubprojects will be designed to maximize environmental benefits including improved drinking \nwater quality through improvements in water supply; reduced depletion of water resources by \nimproving  the  management  of  existing  water  supply  schemes;  improved  surface  and \ngroundwater quality, and solid waste management; reduced flooding through drainage; reduced \nair pollution from improving roads; and improved health and increased social benefits from \ndeveloping  institutional  infrastructure  including  health,  education,  community  parks,  and \nadministrative facilities.   \n \n56.  Subproject selection will prioritize rehabilitation of existing basic urban infrastructure over \nnew construction involving small- to medium-size civil and building works at sites previously or \ncurrently used for the same or similar purposes.32 The Subproject selection criteria rules out \nSubprojects that would be classified as category \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB sensitive\u201d in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy.  During  project  preparation,  an  initial  environmental  examination  was \nconducted.  Subprojects  will  not  generate  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts.  Most \npotential adverse environmental impacts are temporary and localized, and can be addressed \nthrough Subproject design and mitigation measures incorporated in contractors\u2019 contracts. To \nensure  compliance  with  the  Government  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines  and \nrequirements,  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  were  prepared  to  guide \nSubproject implementation and are in the environmental assessment of financial intermediation. \n \n57.  Sustainability.  Initial  financial  projections  and  a  financial  management  assessment \nwere prepared for LLDF in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Financial Governance and \nManagement of Investment Projects Financed by ADB to assess the viability and sustainability \nof the Project. This preliminary financial due diligence indicates that LLDF will be financially self-\nsufficient, and upon completion of capacity development activities under component A, will have \nsufficient  financial  management  capacity.  An  initial  affordability  assessment  of  two  sample \ncommunities indicates sufficient demand to justify the size of component B, and that LAs will \nhave  the  capacity  to  absorb  debt  service  and  recurrent  cost  obligations.  The  Project  is \nconsidered both financially viable and sustainable. \n \nB.  Major Risks \n \n58.  Given the innovative design adopted in the Project, where LAs will be responsible for \nidentifying  and  preparing  Subprojects  and  where  the  strengthened  LLDF  will  appraise \ncreditworthiness  of  LAs  and  viability  of  Subprojects,  inherent  risks  need  to  be  monitored \ncarefully  throughout  project  implementation.  At  present,  LAs  lack  experience  to  prepare \nSubproject proposals for external funding. Similarity, LLDF's role as a fully functioning financial \nintermediary is new; it served mainly as a debt collector for MPCLG in the past. Under the \nProject,  however,  the  roles  and  functions  of  LAs  and  LLDF  are  expected  to  change \nsubstantially. LAs need to develop a sense of ownership for the Subprojects they will develop. \nLLDF will have to become a competent financial intermediary to efficiently channel the financial \n                                                 \n32  Sample Specifications for Potential Sub-Projects is in Appendix 11. \n ", " 18 \nresources made available under the Project to LAs. Foreseen risks include (i) lack of awareness \nand suitably qualified personnel in LAs and the CLG offices to assume the new responsibilities; \n(ii) insufficient support from policymakers for the envisaged transformation of LAs and LLDF; (iii) \npoor performance of LAs in repaying LLDF loans, which may trigger the use of guarantees by \nprovincial  councils;  and  (iv)  political  interference  in  Subproject  selection.  These  risks  are \nmitigated to the greatest extent possible by (i) ensuring LLDF\u2019s readiness prior to subloan \ndisbursement under component B through a tailored institutional strengthening program for \nLLDF; (ii) clearly defining eligibility conditions and Subproject approval criteria; (iii) carefully \ndesigning awareness and capacity-building programs for LAs and provincial councils; and (iv) \nincreasing supervision, by supporting TA project and regular loan review missions. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES  \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n59.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n(i)  The Government and ADB agree that the project implementation arrangements \nreflect the present Government administrative structure in the project area and \nthat  this  may  be  changed  during  project  implementation.  If  the  Government \nproposes  to  change  the  administrative  structure  in  the  project  area,  the \nGovernment will immediately notify ADB of such change and will take all steps \nnecessary to ensure that the project arrangements are revised in consultation \nwith  ADB  to  reflect  the  new  administrative  structure  and  the  viability  of  the \nProject.   \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that throughout project implementation, adequate  \nallocations of the required counterpart funds are made, approved, and released \nin a timely manner to ensure proper project implementation. The Government will \nensure  that  immediately  upon  loan  effectiveness,  an  imprest  account  is \nestablished in the Central Bank of Sri Lanka for MPCLG. \n(iii)  The Government will provide adequate office space for the Project, and will \nensure that the facilities provided under the Project are operated and maintained \nappropriately, and adequate budget will be provided for this purpose.  \n(iv)  The Government will ensure, and cause MPCLG to ensure, that all lands and \nrights-of-way required for the Project are made available in a timely manner, \nadequate compensation is provided prior to the commencement of civil works, \nand involuntary resettlement is carried out in accordance with the resettlement \nframework agreed upon between the Government and ADB, the Government\u2019s \nNational  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy,  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement (1995). The Borrower shall ensure that a Resettlement Plan (RP) is \nprepared and submitted to ADB for approval for the first Subproject, involving \nland acquisition or resettlement activities. This will serve as a model for preparing \nRP  for  any  subsequent  Subproject  involving  land  acquisition  or  resettlement \nactivities.   \n(v)  The Government will ensure, and cause MPCLG to ensure, that the design, \nconstruction, operation, and implementation of all Subproject facilities is carried \nout in accordance with the environmental assessment framework agreed upon \nbetween the Government and ADB; complies with Government environmental \nlaws and regulations and ADB environmental policies and regulations; and any \nadverse  environmental  impacts  arising  from  the  construction,  operation,  and \nimplementation of the Subproject facilities will be minimized by implementing the \nenvironmental  mitigation  and  management  measures,  and  other ", "  19\nrecommendations  specified  in  environmental  assessment  reports  (e.g.,  initial \nenvironmental evaluations).   \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that Subprojects will not affect vulnerable population \ngroups, such as indigenous peoples. In the event of their involvement in any of \nthe Subprojects, the Government will ensure that the Subprojects are carried out \nin accordance with the indigenous peoples development framework agreed upon \nbetween the Government and ADB, and comply with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples (1998).  \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that all the Subprojects meet, to the satisfaction of \nADB, the agreed selection criteria and implementation arrangements; and that all \nSubprojects are, to the satisfaction of ADB, properly controlled and monitored. \n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all \napplicable labor laws. Bidding documents will include a clause prohibiting child \nlabor for construction and maintenance activities, and a clause regarding equal \npay  for  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal  value.  Compliance  with  these \nprovisions will be strictly monitored during project implementation.  \n(ix)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  annual  block  grant  allocation  currently \nprovided from the central Government to LAs continues to be provided, and does \nnot decrease, irrespective of this Project, and whether the total revenue level of \neach LA increases. The Government will disburse the funds to LAs in a timely \nmanner.  \n(x)  The Government will ensure that LAs involved in this Project, with the assistance \nof consulting services, will have developed long-term operation and maintenance \nprocedures and sustainable funds, which represent not less than 5% of the \nSubproject costs to operate and maintain the assets upgraded or constructed \nunder this Project.   \n(xi)  Consistent with ADB\u2019s and the Government\u2019s commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, the Government will ensure that the project \nfunds  are  utilized  effectively  and  efficiently  to  implement  the  Project  and  to \nachieve the project objectives.    \n(xii)  The Government will ensure that at least 50% of the technical staff engaged by \nthe  SPCUs  during  the  Project  are  retained  and  mainstreamed  in  provincial \ncouncils before project completion.   \n(xiii)  The Government, MPCLG, and LLDF will ensure that all project interventions \ncontribute to, or do not detract from, ongoing peace building and community \nreconciliation. In the event that during project implementation any intervention \nhas or is thought to have a negative impact on such peace building or community \nreconciliation efforts, the Government and ADB will mutually determine whether \nthe intervention should be continued, redesigned, suspended, or cancelled. \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Negotiations \n \n60.  The Mission and the Government agreed that the following will be a condition to be \nfulfilled by the Government prior to loan negotiations: Prior to loan negotiations, the Government \nwith concurrence of ADB will appoint a project director responsible for overall administration and \ncoordination of the Project and for monitoring the overall implementation of the Project.  \n \nC.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n61.  The Mission and the Government agreed that the following will be conditions to loan \neffectiveness: \n \n ", " 20 \n (i)  The Government will have constituted an NSC.

The Local Loans and Development Fund (LLDF) is a statutory body operating under the \nMinistry of Provincial Councils and Local Government (MPCLG). Created under the Local Loans \nand Development Ordinance No.22 of 1916, which has been amended from time to time, the \nmain functions of LLDF include granting and administering loans for investment in infrastructure \ndevelopment  and  revenue-generating  projects  of  local  authorities  (LAs).  LLDF  is  still  not \nautonomous; it is still under the general supervision of MPCLG (para. 6). Since it does not \naccept deposits from the general public, it is not under any control or subject to regulation of the \nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka. \n \n1.  Status and Mandated Functions  \n \n2.  The prime objective of LLDF is to meet the capital investment needs of the LAs through \nlending. It advances loans to LAs at a market-based rate of interest, as well as to any person or \nbody for any purpose of public utility. LLDF loans are subject to limits of borrowing powers of the \nLA as prescribed in their governing law/ordinance.  \n \n3.  In  its  early  stages  (1930\u20131950),  LLDF  provided  loan  facilities  to  state  officers  and \ncooperative  societies.  But  after  1950,  its  activities  were  limited  to  LAs.  Until  1984,  the \nDepartment of Local Government managed LLDF. One of the highlights of this period was the \ninability of LLDF to fully utilize treasury allocations1. In 1985, LLDF was assigned to the Urban \nPlanning  Unit  under  the  Municipal  Management  Project.  During  this  period  LLDF  was \nrecognized by  LAs  as  a  nodal  funding  agency.  Since  UPU  was  dissolved  in  1995,  LLDF \nrecruited permanent staff and has since managed on its own. For the first 5 years, i.e., until \n2000 the Treasury made all salary reimbursements. Since then, LLDF has not relied on the \nTreasury for recurrent expenditures. During 2003, LLDF management transferred to MPCLG. \n \n4.  LLDF is primarily capitalized through sums appropriated by the central Government \n(General Treasury through MPCLG), and recovery of repayment of its loans. The law also \nprovides  for  sourcing  of  loans  by  LLDF  from  the  consolidated  fund,  commercial  banks, \ngovernment-sponsored lending institutions, and loans from LAs themselves. Presently, LLDF \nreceives  funds  from  the  Treasury  in  the  form  of  loan  at  a  concessionary  rate  of  interest \nrepayable to the Treasury in 25 years. As on 31 December 2004, the total amount of loans \ngranted to LAs was SLRs377 million. LLDF keeps a margin on interest to cover its overheads, \nthus causing no burden to the Treasury with regard to LLDF management.  \n \n5.  LLDF could set up a trust fund; contribute to the central revenue stream when directed \nby the minister in charge; and pay all expenses incurred for LLDF administration and all sums \nthat from time-to-time may be payable, by way of principal or interest, on sums lent to the \ncommissioners by LLDF.  \n \n2.  Organization Structure and Functional Staffing  \n \n6.  A board of commissioners consisting of 13 members manages the LLDF. Chaired by the \nMPCLG secretary, the board includes all commissioners of local government (CLGs), public \nofficers nominated by the minister in charge of irrigation, power, highways, and finance. The \nminister with the local government portfolio appoints all commissioners. The commissioners \nconstitute  the  body  corporate.  The  chief  executive  officer  looks  after  the  day-to-day \n                                                 \n1  Local Loans and Development Fund. 2003. Annual Reports and Accounts. Colombo.

LLDF recently engaged about \n24 graduate trainees to work in the districts (CLGs). Overheads of fund administration are borne \nby the income earned by the fund.   \n \n3.  LLDF Operations, Loan Portfolio, Debt Securitization, Loan Recovery, and \nFinancial Viability \n \n7.  While the market rate for commercial loans in Sri Lanka is 13% per annum, LLDF \nlending rates range from 6.5% to 10% per annum depending on the type of development. The \ntenure for repayment of loans is presently 5 years for equipment and 10 years for all others \n(with a grace period of 2 years for loan repayment). The margin on loans given to LAs is 2%. \n \n8.  However, not only is the number of loans advanced negligible, the overall net support \nfrom the Treasury has been insignificant. Between 1994 and 2003, the Treasury allocated only \nSLRs348.6 million; LLDF repaid the Treasury SLRs348.6 million.2 The cumulative net outflow \nfrom the Treasury was only about SLRs20.9 million, which is not likely to increase judging from \nthe present weak macroeconomic scenario.  \n \nTable A2.1: LLDF Borrowing from the Government Treasury  \n \n  Loan Period  Interest Rate  Total Amount  Loan Balance End 2003 \nTime Period  (years)  (%)  (SLRs million)  (SLRs million) \n1972\u20131989  40  9.25  185                       77 \n1990\u20131999  25  9.25  172                     131 \n2000\u20132003  25  6.00  179                     164 \nLLDF = Local Loans and Development Fund. \nSource: LLDF, 2004. \n \n9.  At present, the LLDF loan portfolio has more than 600 active loans (Table A2.2). The \naverage value of loan for municipal councils is SLRs2 million, for urban councils SLRs1 million, \nand for pradeshiya sabhas SLRs0.75 million. The weighted average interest rate ranges from \n11% for municipal councils, 9.6% for urban councils, and 9.1% for pradeshiya sabhas. The \noverall average interest rate is 9.2%. In 2003 and 2004, approximately 60\u201385% of loans were \nreleased to pradeshiya sabhas, 12\u201322% to urban councils, and 1\u201315% to municipal councils. \n \nTable A2.2: Details of Treasury Loans Provided by LLDF to Local Authorities \n \n      Weighted Average  Total Loan  Total Loan \n  Total No  Average Size  Interest Rates  Amount  Balance \nLocal Authority  of Loans  (SLRs million)   (%)  (SLRs million)   (SLRs million) \nMunicipal Council      110          1.87         11.0           205.8           112.6 \nUrban Council      113          1.05           9.6           118.2             72.1 \nPradeshiya Sabhas      395          0.76           9.1           299.5           178.5 \nTotal      618          1.01           9.2           623.5           363.2 \nLA = local authority, LLDF = Local Loans and Development Fund. \nSource: LLDF data, 2004. \n \n10.  LLDF is empowered by its governing ordinance to take security for repayment of all \nloans given to LAs, with interest, in the form of either a mortgage of immovable property, or any \nrate or tax together with a personal security. It is empowered to recover loans from LAs in case \n                                                 \n2  LLDF obtained loans up to the value of SLRs536 million between 1972 and 2003, and has a total loan balance of \nSLRs372 million owing to the Treasury at the end of 2003. As at end of 2004, it stood at SLRs1,072 million.

Loan recoveries of LLDF loans have improved over the last few years with recovery of \ncapital and interest averaging around 78%. While the rate of recovery of capital is higher from \nmunicipal councils and the rate of recovery of interest is higher from urban councils, recovery of \nboth capital and interest was lower in pradeshiya sabhas in the last 2 years. Overall the LLDF \nappears to be quite effective in recovering loans. Although these figures augur well, if all the \narrears of loans taken previously are accounted for the recovery rates decline sharply. This is \nlargely because a large number of loans provided to LAs in the north and east cannot be \nrecovered as they are affected by the civil unrest as well as by the recent tsunami disaster.  \n \nTable A2.3: Loan Recoveries of LLDF (Treasury) Loans in 2004 \n \nTreasury Loans Recovery in 2004 \nLoan Recoveries  (SLRs million) \nCollection \nCapital   Total Receivable  Total Received  Arrears  Efficiency % \nMunicipal Council            20.38        16.32        4.06  80.1 \nUrban Council              8.92          7.18        1.74  80.5 \nPradeshiya Sabhas            41.22        33.72          7.5  81.8 \nTotal            70.52        57.22        13.3  81.1 \nInterest    \nMunicipal Council           11.33          7.38        3.95  65.1 \nUrban Council             7.39          5.21        2.18  70.5 \nPradeshiya Sabhas           15.36        11.49        3.87  74.8 \nTotal           34.08        24.08      10.00  70.7 \nCapital and Interest             \nMunicipal Council           31.71        23.70        8.01  74.7 \nUrban Council           16.31        12.39        3.92  76.0 \nPradeshiya Sabhas           56.58        45.21      11.37  79.9 \nTotal         104.60        81.30      23.30  77.7 \nLLDF = Local Loans and Development Fund. \n     Source: LLDF data, 2004. \n \n12.  On the whole, LLDF has not been able to develop into a sustainable local government \nfund with a strong corpus. An indication of this is that total loans extended were less than \nrecoveries of principal and interest by about SLRs58.6 million in 2004. While this position may \nto an extent reflect the recoveries made on account of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nloans, overall it does not reflect a very promising growth-oriented fund, unless a major capacity-\nbuilding effort is initiated to transform LLDF. \n \n4.  Lending Margins and Operating Margins  \n \n13.  Average  LLDF  lending  and  operating  costs,  with  respect  to  loans  provided  under \nTreasury funds are presented in Table A2.4. The operating costs are quite low, when compared \nwith the number of loans handled by LLDF.

Financial Performance of LLDF4 \n \n14.  The  financial  performance  for  2003/04  is  quite  discouraging.  Net  income  after  tax \nplummeted by 82% even though net interest income (interest earned less Interest paid) fell by \nonly 39%. This resulted from the massive provision of SLRs4.0 million for bad debts, in LLDF\u2019s \nfiscal year ending March 2004. Profit margins fell both before and after tax (Table A2.5). \n \nTable A2.5: LLDF Performance \n \nItem     \nProfit After Tax/Net Worth  1.0%  5.9% \nProfit Before Tax/Net Worth  2.7%  5.9% \nEarnings Before Interest And Tax/Capital Employed 2.7%  5.5% \n                   Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n15.  As heavy provisioning was done in 2003/04 (some of it no doubt relating to earlier \nyears), performance should improve next year. However, interest spread needs to be protected \nas it fell from 24% to 15%.  \n \n16.  Analysis of the balance sheet reveals that LLDF is heavily leveraged with the debt\u2013\nequity ratio standing at a worrisome 16.24. In fact, it has worsened greatly since 2002/03 when \nit stood at 8.04.This situation has been caused by a huge increase of 1,028% in borrowings \nfrom  the  Treasury\u2500Urban  Development  and  Low-Income  Housing  (Sector)  Project5.  The \nborrowings increased from SLRs48.6 million to SLRs548.0 million. The debt-equity ratio does \nnot take into account the large increase of SLRs7.9 million (256%) in interest payable on the \nproject. \n \n17.  On  the  cash-flow  front,  debtors  increased  by  86%  (from  SLRs559.7  million  to \nSLRs1,038.6  million),  and  other  receivables  (interest  and  cash  balance)  by  95%  (from \nSLRs75.3 million to SLRs146.6 million), thus impacting cash flow adversely. \n \n18.  These trends do not portend well for the future if extended linearly. Steps need to be \ntaken to lift income to higher levels, to increase equity so as to reduce leverage, and manage \nreceivables efficiently. Armed with new powers, LLDF should not provide for bad debts in the \nfuture. \n                                                 \n4  Based on analysis of annual financial statements for the years 2002/03 and 2003/04. \n5  ADB. 1998.

", "    Appendix 2  29\n \n6.  Experience with ADB  \n \n19.  LLDF has been associated with a previous ADB-funded project for loan recovery. The \nUrban Development and Low Income Housing Project in 2000 (total loans will be SLRs2,300 \nmillion  by  mid  2005)  focused  on  development  of  17  urban  centers  through  the  Urban \nDevelopment  Ministry.  The  total  loan  component  is  SLRs2,378  million.  Under  this  project, \nLLDF\u2019s margin in the 1st year was SLRs80 million. LLDF was not involved in the appraisal of \nsubprojects,  and  was  only  brought  in  as  a  recovery  agency  by  entering  into  a  tripartite \nagreement with ADB and MPCLG. \n \nTable A2.6: Recovery of the Urban Development and Low Income Housing Project Loans \n(2004) \n \nLoan Recovery in 2004 \n(SLRs million) \nCollection \nItem  Total Receivable  Total Received  Arrears  Efficiency (%) \nCapital                 2.47              2.00     0.47            81.0 \nInterest a              16.99              8.90     8.09            52.4 \n  Total              19.46            10.90     8.56            56.0 \n   a Interest received up to 31 January 2005 was SLRs14.4 million, thus increasing the collection efficiency of \ninterest to 85% and of total to 85%. \nSource: Local Loans and Development Fund, 2004. \n \n7.  Accounts and Audit Policies and Assessment  \n \n20.  LLDF created the internal Audit and Management Committee in 2000 consisting of two \nmembers of the board of commissioners and the internal auditor to ensure that accounts are \nfinalized  and  annual  reports  are  submitted  to  Parliament  according  to  the  Public  Finance \nCircular No. PF/PE 21. This has facilitated timely submission of accounts to the auditor general \nof Sri Lanka. The committee also looks into irregularities in accounting and submits formal \nreports to LLDF. LLDF operations have led to improved financial results. In 2003, for example, it \nhad a surplus of SLRs3.8 million as compared with a surplus of SLRs2.5 million in 2002. \n \n21.  The  auditor  general  who  submits  audit  reports  to  Parliament  conducts  the  audit. \nAccounts and audit of LLDF are now completed on time; these are completed up to 2003. By \nand  large,  the  audit  reports  have  found  that  financial  statements  conform  to  the  stated \naccounting  policies  and  present  a  true  and  fair  view  of  LLDF\u2019s  financial  position.  They \nnevertheless point to the lapses as well. According to the audit report for 2003\u20132004 the year, \nfor example, SLRs508.8 million of loans and SLRs83.64 million of interests are outstanding. \n  \nB.  Institutional Requirements and Financial Intermediary Transformation \n \n8.  Loan and Project Conditions  \n \n22.  The following assurances/conditions must be met by the Government before funds for \ncomponent B of the Project\u2014relating to LLDF and project funds\u2014will be disbursed: (i) prepare a \nstrategy and time-bound action plan for performance improvement of existing functions, and \ntransformation into a full financial intermediary, (ii) provide a provincial council guarantee and \nintercept  mechanism  assurance  for  subproject  loans  to  individual  LAs,  and  (iii)  ensure \ncompliance of the principles for the operation of the project fund. \n   ", "30   Appendix 2 \n9.  Proposed Organizational Structure \n \n23.  Strengthening LLDF will involve the use of specialists. A core team of four members will \ninclude  (i)  a  fund  manager  with  economic/financial  background,  (ii)  a  civil  engineer  with \ninfrastructure finance knowledge, (iii) an environment and/or social development specialist, and \n(iv) accountants. In addition, a core group of sector specialists may be engaged to provide \nsupport for various LLDF activities (including a marketing expert).  \n \n  10.  Business Plan/Implementation Schedule  \n \n24.  LLDF strengthening is an integral part of successful project implementation. LLDF will \nneed to carry out a number of activities to improve performance of its existing functions and \ntransforming itself into an autonomous and sustainable development financial intermediary for \nproviding  long-term  finance  for  infrastructure  to  LAs.  The  initial  task  is  identifying  staffing \nrequirements for areas to be addressed by the business plan. A strategy will be developed and \nsupport  provided  for  strengthening  project  evaluation,  legal  documentation,  debt  recovery \nstructures,  and  development  of  a  marketing  strategy.  In  addition,  guidelines  and  systems \nrequired for stringent project appraisal, loan documentation, and monitoring and loan recovery \nwill be set up. In addition, a strategy for engagement with provincial councils and LAs, and legal \nrecourse for debt recovery under project loans will be developed. The second task will include \nanalyzing the existing loan portfolio and identifying priority sectors. As a part of the evaluation of \nLAs and subprojects, chronic loan defaulters will be identified and listed. Based on the final \nbusiness plans, additional staffing requirements will be identified. A team of sector specialists \nwill be identified and made available to provide support for implementing various components of \nthe business plan. Training needs assessment of the existing staff vis-\u00e0-vis the requirements of \nthe business plan will also be undertaken to upgrade the skills of existing staff. Marketing of \nLLDF will be an important component; workshops and other awareness-building exercises will \nbe conducted in an effort to build demand and the loan application pipeline. Since subproject \nfunding will have been initiated, reforms in treasury management especially for unlent funds will \nbe undertaken. Once the business plans, strategies, and systems are ready; these will be \nsubmitted for approval by the LLDF board and ADB. When LLDF is approved as a full finance \nintermediary institution (complying with ADB OM D6 requirement), component B disbursement \ncan commence.  \n \nC.

Loans provided by LLDF to LAs under the Project will have a term of 12 years with a 2-\nyear grace period for principal repayment and to be repaid in 40 equal quarterly installments \nthereafter; with interest of SLIBOR (12 month) per annum to be charged on the outstanding ", "    Appendix 2  31\nloan. The maximum lending level is restricted to two times the respective LAs own revenues to \nensure repayment. The maximum lending level has been estimated as $1.6 million for municipal \ncouncils, $290,000 for urban councils, and $160,000 for pradeshiya sabhas. Based on this and \nloan components for each type of LA, an average project size of 30% and a project mix of 20% \nfor municipal councils, 30% for urban councils, and 50% for PS, the average subproject size is \nestimated at $317,700 (Table A2.8). \n \nTable A2.8: Average Loan Size \n \nMunicipal Council  Urban Council   Pradeshiya Sabhas  \nItem   ($)  ($)  ($) \nMaximum Project Capacity (average)  3,075,000  674,000  485,000 \nAverage Project Size (assuming 30%)     923,000  202,000  145,000 \nProject Mix  20%  30%  50% \nWeighted Average Project Size  317,700 \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n27.

For the purpose of analysis, is the funds are considered to be released over years 1 to \n6 in the proportion of 0:5:15:30:30:20.

Financial Viability Summary. The projection\u2019s assumptions are the following: \n(i)  The Government will cover all exchange risks associated with the ADB loan. \nThe LLDF loan amount remains constant in dollar terms. \n(ii)  Interest is charged on the loan component of funds loaned to the LAs at 10% \nper annum the amount is to be repaid by the LAs from the 3rd year onward in \n10 equal annual installments. \n(iii)  Available  surplus  funds  (on  return  from  LAs)  will  be  reinvested  by  LLDF \n  and interest will be earned on the cumulative balance at 10% per annum.  \n(iv)  LLDF  will  repay  the  Government  from  9th  year  onward  in  96  quarterly \ninstallments. It will pay interest to Government at 1% per annum on the \noutstanding loan amount during the 8-year grace period and at 1.5% per \nannum thereafter.  \n(v)  The LAs will make all payments on a timely basis (paras. 30\u201333). Delay in \npayments  may  adversely  affect  LLDF\u2019s  schedule  of  repayment  to  the \nGovernment. \n \n29.  The net result of these transactions will be that LLDF will be in a comfortable position to \nmeet its loan and interest commitments. Table A2.10 shows the net flows of LLDF in the first 5 \nyears, while Table A2.10 shows the net flows of LLDF in the last 5 years of the repayment cycle. \nAccording  to  the  analysis,  LLDF  will  have  a  positive  annual  balance,  and  due  to  the \nreinvestment of surplus funds at 10% per annum, will be able to substantially increase its loan ", "32   Appendix 2 \nportfolio. Under these assumptions, LLDF will end the cycle of repayment (year 32) with an \navailable cumulative balance of about $74.98 million.

LA Options to Repay an LLDF Loan \n \n30.   LAs undertake a number of functions essential for the welfare of the society. As part of \ntheir jurisdictional powers, LAs are authorized to collect revenues against some of the services \nprovided by them in form of user charges (direct services), tax, fines, cesses, etc. Although cost \nrecovery by LAs is not predominant, it has the potential to become a major source of own \nrevenue. Unfortunately, most LAs are already hard pressed to provide even the minimum level \nof basic services due to resource and institutional constraints. LAs have the power to impose \nthe following taxes within their jurisdiction:   \n \n(i)  LA assessment rate (similar to property tax), \n(ii)  entertainment tax, \n(iii)  tax on animals and vehicles, \n(iv)  licence fees (stamp duties), \n(v)  rents, and  \n(vi)  user charges (service tax). ", "    Appendix 2  33\n \nThese taxes are critical and can provide buoyancy to the overall revenues of LAs, which is \ncritical for their financial autonomy and sustainability. \n \n31.   The assessment rates (or Property Tax) can be increased if property valuation can be \nmade more frequently and the process is simplified. Currently, valuation of property is made \nonce in five years and sometimes even longer if there is a backlog in the Department of \nValuation (DV). At present LA has to make a request to the DV at least two years ahead of time \nif the valuation is to be completed in time. In practice the LAs, do not send the request two years \nin advance and the process of valuation takes longer to complete, depriving the LA of additional \nrevenue. If the valuation process is simplified, and the time frame for valuation shortened, rate \nincreases could be made more frequently. Furthermore, due to poor collection efforts, many \nlocal authorities are unable to collect their dues. Warrant costs to be collected from defaulting \nratepayers cannot exceed 10% of the assessment rates and therefore is dependent on the \nexisting rates. If assessment rates are increased, the warrant costs would similarly increase.  \nAssessment rate is allowed at maximum 12% of the assessed property value; which is in many \nLAs  currently  imposed  to  only  3-4%.  Many  mayors  said  during  appraisal  that  they  are \nconsidering to increase this to at last 5-6% level.     \n \n32.   The local authorities have been authorized to collect an annual tax only from industries, \ntrades, and businesses. Rents on buildings are authorized by the Acts, but the Council of the \nLocal Authority must pass a resolution to decide on the rent to be charged, which is currently \nbased on the annual value. If the estimated valuation rates are low, as is usually the case, the \nrental value may not be equal to the market value, resulting in reduced revenue. Currently, \ncertain market stalls are auctioned on an annual basis to the highest bidder. In such cases, \nproperties can be rented at market rates by LAs. Due to poor collection efforts by the LA, the full \namount of the dues payable within the existing legal framework is also not usually collected. \n \n33.   There are many activities, which full cost recovery can be made. This group comprises \nof activities mainly of a service nature and includes such services as, clearing of blocked or \noverflowing  latrine  pits,  clearing  of  blocked  drains  and  drainage,  cutting  and  clearing  of \nobstructions such as trees on roads and by-lanes, garbage collection, provision of street lights, \npublic toilets, visitor rest areas and markets, and regulation and control of commercial and \nbusiness activities. In many LAs, service tax is imposed for commercial buildings and residential \nbuildings which are within 100 meter radius from a specific intersection where public utility \n(communal water) is provided. By expanding the supply coverage, LAs can issue ordinance to \nincrease the radius to 300m.

Based on the review of selection procedure used in similar earlier projects and actual \nfact  finding  under  technical  assistance  (TA),  five  parameters  were  used  to  select  local \nauthorities (LAs) for inclusion in the Project (i) economic growth potential, (ii) governance, (iii) \nsocial equity, (iv) financial management, and (v) level of infrastructure. Following a consultative \nprocess, the selection framework discussed during the stakeholders\u2019 workshop. The participants \nsuggested  excluding  economic  growth  impulse.  The  remaining  four  parameters  were  then \nassigned equal weights, which were then allocated to the indicators of the four parameters.  \n \n2.  To collect the primary quantitative data for LA selection, a questionnaire was prepared in \nconsultation with the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government (MPCLG), It was \ndiscussed  in  a  meeting  of  all  eight  provincial  commissioners  of  local  government  (CLGs), \nchaired by the MPCLG secretary, MPCLG. The questionnaires were distributed to LAs in all \ndistricts other than Colombo through the office of the CLGs. Completed questionnaires were \nreceived from 189 LAs from the nine provinces. \n \nB.  Subproject Selection and Approval Process \n \n3.  LAs that secured a score of 60 and more were selected for the Project. Subsequently, \nfollowing the advice of the Project Steering Committee to ensure selection of at least one LA in \neach district, three more LAs were selected in the three districts (excluding Colombo) on the \nbasis of the highest score in these districts. These are Elpitiya pradeshiya sabha in Galle \ndistrict,  Dehiattkandiya  pradeshiya  sabha  in  Ampara,  and  Karaichchi  pradeshiya  sabha  in \nKilnochchi district. Thus in all, 68 LAs are selected for the Project (component A) (Table A4). \nThe project preparatory TA team conducted field visits to 35 LAs for initial identification of \nsubproject and scoping.  \n \n4.  Although the TA has identified a few subprojects, the 68 shortlisted LAs can still identify \nnew  subprojects.  The  subproject  selection  and  approval  process  is  outlined  in  Figure  A4. \nParticipating LAs, based on stakeholder consultations and community prioritization, can identify \nsubprojects  and  submit  them  to  the  CLG,  which  will  assess  the  subprojects  based  on \npredetermined  criteria  para.  6.  If  a  forwarded  subproject  does  not  satisfy  all  criteria,  the \nrespective LA will be required to reconsider and may be provided support from subproject \ncoordination unit (SPCU). Once the CLG approves a subproject, the LA must prepare detailed \nfeasibility reports with assistance from the Project, and then submit the proposal to the project \ncoordination unit (PCU) for approval.  \n \n5.  The  PCU  will  reassess  the  subproject  against  a  set  of  criteria  paras.  6\u201311.  If  the \nsubproject does not satisfy all criteria on technical grounds, the PCU can help the LA identify a \ndesign; supervision support will be provided by a panel of consultants/contractors (identified by \nthe PCU), who will assist the SPCU and LA in preparing detailed feasibility studies. Once the \nLocal Loans and Development Fund (LLDF) approves the subproject, the LA will give a call for \ntenders. Each LA-SPCU will have a tender board, which will evaluate all tenders and give the \nfinal award. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will assess the first two subprojects from each \nof  the  five  subsectors.  Then  ADB  will  only  review  those  valued  at  more  than  $500,000. \nHowever,  ADB  will  review  all  subprojects  that  will  incur  land  acquisition  and  involuntary \nresettlement.  For  cases  where  the  technical  feasibility  reports  of  the  SPCU  are  directly \napproved by the PCU, the design and supervision support will be identified. Otherwise, the ", "36  Appendix 4                                                                                             \nsame support team, which assisted in preparing the detailed feasibility studies, will be retained \nfor supervision of implementation and ensuring quality control and timeliness of delivery.   \n \nTable A4: Local Authorities Selected for Phase 1 \nfor Infrastructure Investment under the Project  \nS.No  Local Authority  Total    S.No  Local Authority  Total \n1  Koralaipattu   75    35  Kottiyagama  63 \n2  Trincomalee Town and Gravets  75    36  Manmunai South Eruvil Pattu   63 \n3  Ratnapura   73    37  Pallepola  63 \n4  Ukkuwela  72    38  Walapane  63 \n5  Vavuniya  70    39  Walallaavita  62 \n6  Hingurangoda  70    40  Ratnapura  62 \n7  Kanthale  70    41  Balangoda  62 \n8  Weeraketiya  69    42  Jaffna  62 \n9  Kuliyapitiya  69    43  Pachchilaipalli  62 \n10  Chilaw  69    44  Kurunagale  62 \n11  Tangalle   68    45  Ibbagamuwa  62 \n12  Warakkapola  68    46  Thalawa  62 \n13  Gampola  68    47  Kaathankudi  62 \n14  Rajanganaya  67    48  Nuwaraeliya  62 \n15  Batticaloa  67    49  Panadura  61 \n16  Mathale  67    50  Monaragala  61 \n17  Dambulla  67    51  Bandarawela  61 \n18  Lankapura  66    52  Embilipittiya  61 \n19  Dompe  65    53    Manthai East  61 \n20  Mulatiyana  65    54    Vavuniya South  61 \n21  Beliaththa  65    55    Valvettithurai  61 \n22  Mannar  65    56    Variyapola  61 \n23  Chavakachcheri  65    57    Nikeweratiya  61 \n24  Vilgamuwa  65    58    Kobeikanne  61 \n25  Mahiyanganaya  64    59    Mawathagama  61 \n26  Thunukkai  64    60    Kiribawa  61 \n27  Madevachchiya  64    61    Udubaddawa  61 \n28  Gampaha  63    62    Thimbulagala  61 \n29  Welimada  63    63    Kahatagasdehiliya  61 \n30  Thihagoda  63    64    Trincomalee  61 \n31  Tangalle  63    65    Thalawakkale/ Lindula  61 \n32  Kamburupittiya  63    66    Dehiaththakandiya *  57 \n33  Ehaliyagoda  63    67    Elpitiya a  56 \n34  Kegalle  63    68    Karaichchi *  54 \nS.No = subproject number. \na Selected as per the suggestion of the Project Steering Committee. \nSource: GoSL-Asian Development Bank PPTA survey result. \n \n \nC.   General Subproject Selection Criteria  \n \n6.  Subprojects will be identified on the basis of needs of the local communities, financial \nand economic feasibility, environmental impact assessment, preferred government strategy, and \nsustainability. Accordingly, the selection of subprojects will be made in terms of the following \ngeneral criteria: \n \n(i)  Priority  requirement  of  community  and  link  to  development  plan.  The \nsubproject should be in line with the priority requirements of the community at \nlarge and should address the basic urban infrastructure requirements of the LA ", "  Appendix 4  37\narea.  This  will  be  ascertained  through  on-site  consultations  with  community-\nbased organizations by using tools such as participatory rapid appraisal, and \nparticipatory learning and action, which allow rapid assessment of community \nneeds and priorities. The proposed subproject should be in conformity with local \nmaster plans and vision statement (if available), and/or regional development \nplans, as well as local development goals. Subproject integration with local and \nregional plans will ensure a balanced sustainable development of the region.  \n(ii)  Technical feasibility of the subproject. The subproject must be technically \nfeasible and the least-cost solution alternative, taking into consideration the need \nto meet reasonable increases in demand. The equipment, material, and other \nresources  as  required  can  be  acquired  in  or  transferred  to,  the  subproject \nlocation without unreasonable obstruction or delay. \n(iii)  Financial state of the LA. The overall financial health of the LA will be assessed \nin  terms  of  own  revenue  as  a  proportion  of  total  revenue,  and  trend  of \ndependence on provincial/national government. Revenue-generating capacity of \nexisting projects, expenditures as a proportion of expenditure norms and other \nindicators of financial strength will be used to determine capacity to repay and \nensure sustainability of the proposed subproject. LAs that have taken loans and \ndefaulted on loan and/or interest repayment will not be eligible for loans under \nthe Project.  \n(iv)  Quality control. Quality control in terms of quality of work/processes as well as \nquality of proposed output will be key criteria for subproject appraisal. Quality \ncontrol techniques suggested by the LA during subproject design, construction, \nsupervision, and operation will be closely assessed. This is not only likely to \nminimize failures but also increase life and benefits of the proposed subproject. \n(v)  Increase in revenue potential and creditworthiness for absorbing loans. \nThe possible impact of the proposed subproject on tax compliance and increase \nin revenue collection of the LA will be closely studied. The loan would be capped \nat 2 times the LA\u2019s own revenues. \n(vi)  Operation and maintenance (O&M). Inadequate budgetary allocation for O&M \nwill result in physical neglect of a subproject. Fiscal capacity of the LAs for \neffective O&M will be assessed to ensure the smooth flow of project benefits; the \nLA will be required to set up a separate account for O&M by depositing 5% of the \nproposed project cost before initiating the subproject.  \n(vii)  Economic and financial returns. Evaluation of economic and financial returns \nfrom  the  subproject  will  be  closely  studied.  Therefore,  the  LA  will  need  to \ncalculate economic and financial internal rates of return according to LLDF and \nADB guidelines. The findings will be evaluated vis-\u00e0-vis other criteria including \nenvironmental and social impact, etc. In addition, LLDF will assess economic \njustification  of  the  subprojects,  based  on  issues  listed  in  Supplementary \nAppendix F, paras. 37\u250053. These include (i) overall state of services in the \nprovincial council and LA, (ii) demand for the service, (iii) estimate of benefits, (iv) \ntechnical specifications and quantification of costs, (v) cost of capital and user \ncharges, (vi) net benefits, and (vii) risk factors.  \n(viii)  Environmental impact. An environmental assessment will be undertaken for all \nsubprojects.  LAs  will  undertake  a  preliminary  screening  using  a  rapid \nenvironmental  assessment  checklist  ensuring  compliance  with  specific \nenvironmental criteria for subproject selection, and an environmental and project \nbrief for review as part of the assessment of subprojects. Subprojects cleared \nafter the preliminary assessment will require compliance with Government and ", "38  Appendix 4                                                                                             \nADB guidelines on environmental assessment. Procedures to be followed for \nenvironmental assessment of financial intermediation loans and review are in \nSupplementary Appendix B.  \n(ix)  Social and resettlement issues. LAs will assess social and resettlement issues \nto  ensure  that  subprojects  will  not  have  significant  adverse  social  and \nresettlement  issues.  Subprojects  assessed  to  have  significant  resettlement \nimpacts will not be undertaken. For subprojects requiring land acquisition or \nresettlement activities, a detailed assessment of resettlement impacts will be \nundertaken by LAs consistent with Government and ADB policy. LAs will prepare \na Resettlement Plan for subprojects with resettlement impacts. A resettlement \nframework to guide the formulation of resettlement plans is in Supplementary \nAppendix D. The Government will prepare and submit a Resettlement Plan for \nADB approval for the first subproject involving land acquisition or resettlement \nactivities. This will serve as a model for preparing Resettlement Plan for any \nsubsequent subproject involving land acquisition or resettlement activities. \n(x)  Indigenous people\u2019s issues. LAs will undertake a preliminary assessment of \nsubproject  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples.  Subprojects  with  impacts  on \nindigenous peoples will require a  detailed social impact assessment and an \nindigenous  peoples\u2019  development  plan.  An  indigenous  peoples  development \nframework to guide the LAs is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n(xi)  Gender. LAs will evaluate the impacts of proposed subprojects on gender issues \nbased on the following principles: (i) maximum participation of women, especially \nthose from poor/low-income households, in community-based decision making \n(quantitative targets may help); (ii) gender-equal responsibility in construction \nand  O&M;  (iii)  consideration  for  women\u2019s  time  and  space  constraints  and/or \nrequirements; (iv) gender disaggregated data collection whenever possible; (v) \nuse  of  gender  responsive  nongovernment  and/or  community-based \norganizations;  and  (vi)  gender  awareness  among  the  LA  officials.  A  written \nagreement  from  the  LA  accepting  the  responsibility  for  maintenance  of  the \nsubproject infrastructure is available. \n (xii)  Improving governance. The subproject includes improving and strengthening \nlocal  governance  and  efficiency  through  support  for  improved  infrastructure \nprovision  in  the  LA.  As  this  is  the  most  critical  criteria,  the  assessment  of \nsubprojects will be made in terms of factors such as improving staff performance, \nincreased  technical  capacity,  public  participation  in  decision  making  (and \nimplementation  and  O&M  wherever  possible),  increased  willingness  to  pay, \nimproved financial health and creditworthiness of the LA, etc.   \n \nD.  Sector-Specific Subproject Selection Criteria  \n \n7.  This section outlines the broad sector-specific criteria as guidelines for the selection of \nsubprojects.  The detailed sector-specific criteria will be developed by the PCU at the time of \nimplementation.  \n \n8.  Community  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation.  The  objectives  should  be  to  improve \naccess to safe drinking water, improve sanitation, minimize water-borne diseases, and improve \nhealth conditions. The focus should be on areas with a large population with little or no access \nto safe drinking water. Other criteria include the following: \n  \n(i)  For new schemes, the number of connections should not exceed 500 and the \nrespective  LA  and/or  a  community-based  organization  agree  to  manage  the \nscheme. ", "  Appendix 4  39\n(ii)  For  water  supply  systems,  the  numbers  of  families  to  be  served  for  each \ninstallation should be consistent with national policies. For wells, at least 20\u201325 \nfamilies should benefit from one well, consistent with national policy standards.  \n(iii)  For sanitation facilities, the number of families to be served should be consistent \nwith national policy standards. \n(iv)  A potable water source is not available within a radius of 500 meters from the \nsettlement. \n(v)  The  water  resources  board  and/or  the  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage \nBoard have carried out preliminary investigations, and have certified that potable \nwater of sufficient quantity and quality is available, and the abstraction of water \nwould not create adverse impacts to existing water users or the groundwater \ntable, in both the short and long term. \n(vi)  For tubewells, beneficiary communities have agreed to contribute labor and other \nmaterials  in  kind  for  the  installation  of  hand  pumps  and  construction  of \nbasements, together estimated to be about 5\u201310% of the total cost of civil and \nmechanical works for a typical tubewell.  \n(vii)  For  open  dug  wells,  beneficiary  communities  have  agreed  to  voluntarily \ncontribute10% of the total cost of civil works in kind or labor.  \n(viii)  For sanitation facilities, beneficiaries have agreed to voluntarily contribute the \nlabor required for construction of the civil works.  \n(ix)  Beneficiaries  have  agreed  to  maintain  the  wells,  and  have  formed  a  water \nmanagement organization for this purpose.  \n(x)  The overall community, especially women, have agreed to the location of the \nwells.  \n(xi)  An appropriate agency has agreed to provide TA to beneficiaries for maintenance \nof tubewells.  \n(xii)  No land acquisition to construct the wells is required.  \n(xiii)  Where the location of a well on privately owned land is unavoidable, a written and \nlegally valid assurance from the landholder must be available allowing permanent \naccess of other beneficiaries to the well.  \n \n9.  Access and LA Roads. The objectives should be to improve access and to minimize \ntravel time. The subprojects should be limited to selected rural and LA roads (class D and E) \nand other unclassified roads only. Broad selection criteria include the following: \n \n(i)  Priority to be given to roads serving agricultural or fisheries activities that link \nvillages and relocation schemes included in the project scope to nearby market \ncenters and townships, as identified by the communities and included in village \ndevelopment plans. \n(ii)  Roads to be improved should benefit a substantial proportion of population. \n(iii)  Where possible, the scope of repairs is limited to existing road alignments, where \nno land acquisition is required, except for internal and access roads for relocation \nof villages. \n(iv)  More  than  50%  of  beneficiary  families  have  agreed  to  participate  in  the \nconstruction and to carry out maintenance after rehabilitation. \n(v)  The estimated base cost, should be in line with ongoing similar initiatives. The \ncurrent price in 2005 is less than SLRs500,000/kilometer. \n(vi)  Confirmation is to be available that the beneficiaries are the original landowners \nor occupiers, and not new settlers. \n \n10.  Solid Waste Management. The objectives should be to improve collection, and safe \ndisposal of the solid waste in the LAs. Broad selection criteria include the following: ", "40  Appendix 4                                                                                             \n \n(i)  Activities improve collection and disposal by at least by 30% in LA areas. These \nshould include improvements to household storage, street cleaning, and street-\nside primary storage. \n(ii)  Activities promote public awareness of the population on household management \nof solid waste. \n(iii)  Activities demonstrate availability of a suitable site for safe disposal of solid \nwaste. \n(iv)  Activities improve on-site and disposal site for solid waste treatment.     \n(v)  Activities  demonstrate  community  involvement  in  selection  of  sites  for  safe \ndisposal of solid waste, including acceptance of the site for disposal.  \n(vi)  Where possible, state land should be selected for disposal of solid waste.  \n(vii)  Hazardous waste should be treated separately.  \n \n11.  Drainage Improvements. The objectives should be to improve collection, and safe \ndisposal of the runoff and grey water in the LAs. Broad selection criteria include the following: \n \n(i)  Activities improve collection and disposal of runoff and grey water in LA areas by \nat least by 50%.   \n(ii)  Activities promote public awareness of the population on household management \nof solid waste. \n(iii)  Subproject demonstrates availability of a suitable site for safe disposal site for \nthe water. \n(iv)  Subproject demonstrates community involvement in selection of drainage sites \nfor safe disposal. \n(v)  Minimum or no land acquisition is required for construction of drainage.  \n(vi)  Hazardous waste is to be treated separately.  \n \n12.  Institutional Infrastructures. The objective is to rehabilitate or construct institutional \ninfrastructure to improve service delivery. Institutional infrastructure includes health, education, \nand community parks. Selection criteria include the following:  \n \n(i)  Preference for sites for rehabilitation or reconstruction will be given to facilities in \nrural areas and those that benefit large numbers of people. \n(ii)  The planned facility is already included in the LA development plan. \n(iii)  Facilities other than basic clinics, public libraries and small recreational parks are \nsubject to ADB\u2019s prior approval. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   ", "  Appendix 4  41\n \n        Figure A4: Proposed Subproject Preparation Process \nLA Identifies priority subproject \n    \n SPCU/CLG assesses subproject  \n \nDoes it   NO  \nsatisfy a ll  SPCU provides consultants  to LAs \ncriteria? \nYES \n \n  Preparation of detaile d technical \n  Feasibility reports by LA  \nSubmission to SPCU  \n \nIs subproject  NO   SPCU assists LAs in necessary \nviable ?   changes in Feasibility Reports \nYES \n \nSubmission to LLDF for checking  \nagainst criteria  \n \nYES \nDoes it \nNO  Can the LA/SPCU   \nsatisfy all    prep are the  DSS assists LA/SPCU in preparation \ncriteria?   of Feasibility Report   \nsubproject?  \n \nYES   NO          Identification of DSS \n Final Subproject Approval by    \n ADB if $0.5million above \n \n   Calling of Tenders by SPCU \n \nNO\n    Identification of DSS  \n \n Submission of Tenders and\n Evaluation by SPCU Tender Board \n \nRecall DSS for           \nHas the DSS  YES\n  implementation \n      Award of Tender   alirdeeandtyif iebde?e n   support  \n \nPost Facto Approval by PCU/A  DB \n Implementation assistance \n \nImplementatio n   and quality checks by DSS\n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CLG = commissioner of local government, DSS = design and supervision \nsupport, LA = local authorities, PCU = project coordination unit, SPCU = subproject coordination unit. \nSource: ADB project preparatory technical assistance study. ", "42  Appendix 5 \nURBAN SECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Sector Review \n \n1.  The current urban population is about 5 million, or 27% of the population.1 Approximately \n1.5 million reside in Colombo alone. On average, the urban population is growing nearly twice \nas fast as the rural population. The degree of urbanization is projected to reach 45% by 2015.   \n \n2.  Public infrastructure investment has been considerably below what is needed to sustain \nrapid growth of the economy and increasing urbanization. Generally, the level and quality of \ninfrastructure  is  inadequate  and  poor.  Most  towns  experience  problems  with  congestion, \noverloaded  infrastructure  services,  intermittent  and  low-quality  water  supply,  irregular  and \nfluctuating  voltage  electrical  services,  and  substandard  roads  hampering  integration  of  the \nnational economy and trade. Sanitation, drainage, and solid waste management are other \ncritical problems.  \n \n3.  Wide regional disparities exist in the quality and level of public infrastructure services. \nWestern Province generally has better infrastructure services, notably in Colombo District and \nits environs. The incidence of poverty in urban areas (8% in 2002) is much lower than in rural \nareas (25%) (footnote 1). Per capita incomes in urban areas are more than 60% higher than the \nnational average.2 These numbers provide some indication of the affordability and willingness to \npay for infrastructure services in urban areas. However, these numbers are heavily influenced \nby Colombo district, where the medium household income is almost twice the national average. \nFor the seven provinces where data are available,3 Sabaragamuwa Province is the poorest; \nNorth Central and Uva provinces also record per capita incomes significantly below the national \naverage. \n \n4.  National responsibility for urban affairs rests with two ministries: \n \n(i)  the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government, with line responsibility \nfor provincial and local councils; the Local Loans and Development Fund (LLDF) \n(for loans to LAs), and the Sri Lanka Institute of Local Government (for training); \nboth are attached to the ministry; and \n(ii)  the  Ministry  of  Urban  Development,  Housing,  and  Construction,  with \nresponsibility for providing technical support to local government in planning, \nappraisal,  procurement,  and  management;  the  Urban  Development  Authority \n(UDA)  for  designation  of  urban  areas,  planning,  and  development  (including \ncapital investment plans); it is attached to the ministry. \n \n5.  The  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board  (NWSDB),  National  Housing \nDevelopment  Authority,  Road  Development  Authority,  and  Ceylon  Electricity  Board  play \nimportant roles in providing essential infrastructure services to urban areas. Provincial councils \nand local authorities (LAs) have limited financial and personnel resources to provide urban \ninfrastructure services.4 Civic amenities are their main responsibility, including operation and \n                                                 \n1  Lack of an official definition and criteria for measuring the degree of urbanization means that estimations vary \nwidely, with the official level at about 22%.   \n2  Department of Census and Statistics, Government of Sri Lanka. 2004.

", "     Appendix 5  43\nmaintenance  of  roads  and  drainage,  water  distribution  systems,  public  toilets,  solid  waste \nsystems, markets, and health facilities. \n \n6.  Water Supply. The Government aims to achieve full water supply for the population by \n2010. The World Bank estimates that around 98% of urban population has access to safe water \nand  70%  of  the  rural  population.5 However,  studies  undertaken  in  the  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance (TA) reveal that access to safe drinking water ranges from 10% to 55% in \nmost  LAs.  In  1990,  the  Government  adopted  the  principle  of  community  management  of \nservices, backed by measures to strengthen local institutions in implementing and sustaining \nwater supply programs.6 The trend, however, has been to greater centralization; NWSDB is the \nmain agency responsible for water supply and manages over 75% of piped water schemes in \nthe country. LAs operate and maintain the remaining schemes, most receiving bulk treated \nwater  from  NWSDB.  Service  delivery  is  reportedly  deteriorating,  reflecting  the  weak \nperformance and financial position of NWSDB. The National Water Resources Act, reviewed by \nthe Cabinet in December 2004, but not yet approved, is meant to revitalize the water sector. A \nwater services reform bill is under consideration, and plans are under way to privatize NWSDB.7 \nThe current institutional arrangements result in poor water supply. The Project should contribute \nto changing these institutional arrangements, allowing LAs to contract with alternative water \nsuppliers. NWSDB should continue to address bulk water supply, but on a competitive basis. \nPrivate sector participation should be encouraged8 and LAs should be free to levy water tariffs \nthat will ensure a full supply of potable water.   \n \n7.  Sewerage  and  Sanitation.  Sewerage  and  sanitation  are  related  to  water  supply; \nwastewater  generation  increases  with  the  availability  of  water  and  increased  use  of  flush \nlatrines.9 Only Colombo has a piped sewerage system, other areas rely on septic tanks and pit \nlatrines because construction of proper sanitation facilities is difficult due to high water tables \nand rock outcrops. Coastal towns dispose of wastewater into the sea, reducing the tourism \npotential. Project preparatory TA studies show that only 25% to 50% of the population has \naccess  to  safe  sewerage  and  sanitation  facilities  in  most  LAs.  Poor  conditions  reflect \ninstitutional problems and perhaps insufficient awareness of the importance of a clean and \npleasant environment to health, livelihoods, tourism, and other social and economic interests. \nThe Project should include efforts to increase the priority given by LAs to the sector.  \n \n8.  Drainage. Drainage problems are serious in many urban areas leading to inundation \nduring the monsoon season resulting in stagnant water, frequently polluted by wastewater \n(sewage) and solid waste. Low-lying towns experience the worst problems, but even LAs in hill \nareas report problems. Equipment needs are frequently cited, although assurance that LAs will \nhave  sufficient  funds  to  operate  and  maintain  the  equipment  is  in  question.  Better  urban \nplanning is fundamental to solving drainage and flood control problems. Road drainage is \ninadequate, reflecting in some cases lack of proper design and of operation and maintenance of \ntertiary roads. Realignment of responsibilities may be necessary to solve such issues under the \nnational authority or the provincial councils. The Project will need to address these issues.  \n \n                                                 \n5  World Bank. 2004. World Development Indicators. Washington, DC. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) country \nstrategy and program update indicates that 98% of the urban population has access to safe water, while only 70% \nof the rural population; presumably these are official figures (ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update \n(2005\u2013-2006): Sri Lanka. Manila.    \n6  Proclaimed in 1990 at the New Delhi Global Consultation on Future Water Supply and Sanitation Development.    \n7  This is a highly controversial issue.  \n8  ADB, together with the World Bank, provided key assistance in privatizing the Colombo urban water supply. \n9  The percentage of households with latrine facilities is high across most districts, except in the case of Puttaiam \nDistrict. Department of Census and Statistics Sri Lanka. ", "44  Appendix 5 \n9.  Solid Waste Management. Services are generally available in urban areas, but in a \nmanner that is rudimentary, unsightly, and potentially hazardous to health and the environment, \nespecially  in  low-income  areas.  Lack  of  disposal  facilities  is  critical  in  most  LAs.  The \nGovernment has recently adopted a National Solid Waste Management Strategy. Solid waste \nmanagement systems supported under the Project will need to be consistent with this. The \noption of private sector participation also needs to be explored.   \n \n10.  Tertiary Roads. LAs are responsible for constructing and maintaining class D and E \nroads, which are primarily tertiary roads. Generally, tertiary roads are of poor quality, with the \ndegree of quality inversely related to the class as almost all LAs lack technical and financial \nresources.  LAs  are  spending  far  less  than  they  should  on  maintenance. 10  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) is also supporting development of a road sector master plan, which \nshould help identify institutional issues.11 In addition, road investment under the Project will \nneed to be carefully coordinated with those under other projects, notably those supported by \nADB, World Bank, and Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). From the perspective \nof  strengthening  local  governance,  the  challenge  will  be  to  ensure  that  investments  are \nidentified, planned, implemented, and monitored by LAs, while drawing on provincial and central \nexpertise  for  technical inputs.  The  Project  will  also  need  to  secure assurance  that  proper \nprovision is made for operation and maintenance.   \n \n11.  Community Health. Public health responsibilities of LAs are clearly minimal. LAs are \ngenerally,  but  not  always,  expected  to  provide  facilities  for  health  clinics;  this  is  normally \naccommodated by providing space in a general purpose community center. Medical staff, drug \nsupplies, and equipment are supplied by provincial councils. The Project could contribute to \nstrengthening local governance in the field of community (and preventive) health care, but this \nwould require realignment of governmental responsibilities\u2014at least in practice if not in law. In \nthe current socioeconomic and political economy context, this is unlikely. Community health \nservices rank low in the priority needs of LAs surveyed for the Project. \n \nB.  Urban Planning \n \n12.  Too  many  laws  (as  many  as  seven)  crowd  the  existing  legal  framework  of  urban \nplanning and land management.12 Of these, the Town and Country Planning Ordinance after \namended in 2001 led to the creation of the National Physical Planning Department (NPPD), the \nmain physical planning department of the Government. NPPD has wide powers to formulate a \nnational physical planning policy and basic regional policy parameters and regional structure \nplans for the different regions. NPPD has completed regional structure plans for five of the nine \nregions through the engagement of consultants. However, these need to be approved by the \nNational Steering Committee chaired by the President of Sri Lanka. The National Steering \nCommittee has not yet met.  \n \n13.  Planning involves several groups. UDA, which has to operate within the national and \nregional policy framework provided by NPPD, is responsible for planning specific areas for \n                                                 \n10  This is also a serious problem for national and provincial roads. A road maintenance fund was established, but \ninsufficient budget allocation has been made to it. \n11  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for Preparing the Road Sector \nMaster Plan. Manila; ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance Loan to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for \nRoad Project Preparatory Facility. Manila. The latter includes capacity building for institutions involved in the road \nsector. \n12  Urban Development Authority Law, No. 41 of 1978; Town and Country Planning Ordinance (as amended in 2001); \nHousing & Town Improvement Ordinance; Greater Colombo Economic Commission (present BOI Act); Ceylon \nTourist Board Act; Coast Conservation Act; and Provincial Councils Act, No. 42 of 1987. ", "     Appendix 5  45\nprojects; currently 198 areas are designated as \u201cdeclared\u201d areas. These areas are now under \ninterim  development  control  until  the  development  plans  are  approved  by  the  Planning \nCommittee and the minister and is gazetted under provisions of the UDA law. Until now only six \ndevelopment plans have been gazetted. The Greater Colombo Economic Commission that is \ndesignated as the Board of Investment has overriding powers for Board of Investment-approved \ninvestment projects that are located within the designated export promotion zones and other \nareas. The Housing and Town Improvement Ordinance now operates only within built-up areas \nlocated in pradeshiya sabhas. The Ceylon Tourist Board has powers to regulate development \nwithin designated tourist development or resort areas to ensure protection of amenities and \npromote  an  environment  conducive  for  tourism  development.  The  Coast  Conservation \nDepartment has jurisdiction over planning and regulation of development in the coastal zone \nthat comprises of an area 300 meters seaward and 1 kilometer landward. Since the tsunami, the \nwidth of the coastal zone and planning restrictions are under review by the Coast Conservation \nDepartment. \n \n14.  The UDA Law supersedes physical planning powers of the LAs. Although planning and \ndevelopment control powers of UDA is now delegated to LAs, they are required to follow the \ninterim planning and building regulations formulated and gazetted by UDA in 1986 until separate \ndevelopment plans are formulated for each area with the participation of LAs concerned. \n \n15.  Thus, several national organizations are involved in regional and local physical planning \nthat should logically be carried out by provincial councils and LAs. The Commission of Inquiry \non Local Government Reforms has suggested building the capacity of LAs to enable them to \nregain their lost powers. The Project will be instrumental in enhancing LA institutional capacity \nto enable the restoration of urban planning to them. The Cabinet recently approved the Cabinet \nSubcommittee on Legal Reforms\u2019 suggestion to designate LAs as the planning authority as \nrecommended by the Commission of Inquiry on Local Government Reforms. \n \nC.  Land Management \n \n16.  Implementation of urban development plans and projects require regulation of land use \naccording to the provisions of the development plan, as well as power to make land available for \ninfrastructure services and other development activities. Planning organizations, such as NPPD, \nhave powers only to regulate land use through land use zoning and other planning controls, \nwhich help to carry out regulatory planning. However, urban development planning requires not \nonly regulation of land use but also the promotion of required urban development activities to \ncomprehensively implement an urban development plan. UDA has the regulatory power, as well \nas development promotion and land management powers, to accomplish the objectives of \ndevelopment plans. Legal provisions exist in the Land Acquisition Act (Chapter 460 of legislative \nenactments) to acquire private lands for essential public purposes. The normal acquisition \nprocedure under Section 38 is a highly cumbersome and time-consuming process involving \nabout 44 steps and leads to appeals, ownership, and valuation inquiries; court cases; and \nrestraining orders in many cases. Furthermore, LAs do not have the finances and capacity to \ncarry out land acquisition, which at times takes well over 5 years to complete. Due to delays \ninvolved in normal acquisition procedures (under Section 38); a more expeditious and less time-\nconsuming procedure is provided under Section 38a for the acquisition of lands for urgent public \npurposes. This requires a special certificate to be issued by the minister who initiates the \nacquisition of land required for an urgent public purpose. However, only organizations such as \nUDA, which has the institutional capacity and the resources to provide the initial deposit with the ", "46  Appendix 5 \nacquiring officer, can make use of this provision to acquire land. Acquisition of Crown Land13 is \nconducted under the Crown Lands Ordinance through an application to the Commissioner of \nLands who is a central government functionary. Although LAs enjoy powers of land acquisition, \ntheir existing institutional and human resource capacity constrain actual acquisition of land and \nthey have to ask other agencies, such as UDA, for this. \n \nD.  Environment \n \n17.  Sri Lanka is presently facing significant environmental problems due to high exploitation \nof its natural resources resulting from high population growth, poverty, lack of awareness, \nenvironmentally insensitive and irresponsible behavior, etc. Various studies clearly indicate that \ndegradation of coastal resources and forest and water resources continues.14 Although pollution \ndue  to  anthropogenic  activities  is  of  critical  concern,  pollution  control  in  general,  and  in \nindustries in particular, has made good advances recently due to the establishment of strict \nstandards and regulations. Better enforcement has also resulted in improved environmental \nstatus. This has, however, meant sewerage and wastewater treatment systems are slowly being \nimplemented throughout the country.  \n \n18.  The environmental responsibilities of LAs are mainly confined to pollution control, public \nhealth and safety, and prevention of nuisance. Environmental management with regard to \nnatural resources is mainly carried out by the national agencies (line agencies). However, LAs \nare often invited to participate in activities and projects implemented by these agencies.  \n \n19.  Recently,  pollution  control  responsibilities  have  been  delegated  to  LAs  for  all  low-\npolluting industries. In addition, UDA planning responsibilities are being implemented through \nthe LAs. Planning requirements also deal with many aspects of environmental management \nincluding location decisions. In areas of health and sanitation, responsibilities of LAs include \nconducting clinics for children and mothers, maintaining sanitary conditions in eating places and \nfood stalls, preventing contamination of wells, and promoting good sanitation practices among \nthe public.  \n \n20.  LA success in achieving good result in these areas depends on many factors such as \nleadership, income, technical strength of staff, and staff commitment. In all these areas LAs are \nfacing problems, including lack of technical expertise. Enforcement of sanitation regulations and \nlaws is the responsibility of public health inspectors. However, as most of the inspectors are \nofficers seconded by the Ministry of Health, LAs are unable to benefit from them due to their \nshort tenure and lack of clout. Implementation of planning regulation is done through planning \ncommittees. In the case of UDA declared areas, UDA assistance is provided to LAs on a regular \nbasis, which is satisfactory. The problems are mostly cited in areas not declared by UDA. In \nthese areas, LAs\u2019 ability to control development activities is extremely poor due to the lack of \nland-use plans. The importance of developing land-use plans for all LAs was highlighted during \nmany  discussions.  UDA  regulations  need  to  be  reviewed  and  deficiencies  in  development \nactivities that are carried out without notifying LAs concerned need to be rectified.  \n \n \n                                                 \n13  Lands that do not belong to either the government or the individuals. \n14  UNEP-Ministry of Forestry, 2001, State of the Environment Sri Lanka, Thailand: United Nations Environment \nProgramme.

No \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka:  \n \nUsing the national poverty linea the proportion of the Sri Lankan population classified as poor was 22.7% in 2002. While \nincome poverty in Sri Lanka appears to be low, nonincome poverty appears to be increasing. Basic urban infrastructure is \ngenerally in poor condition and deteriorating. Approximately 30% of the population lack access to safe drinking water, 24% \nto safe sanitation facilities, and 56% to hygienic toilets. Inadequate sanitation is a leading cause of public health problems \nin communities. Poor and deficient basic urban infrastructure hinders improvement in the livelihood of poor communities. \nStudies identify that the poor from the lowest income quintile groups, estate plantation labor communities, small rural \nagricultural communities, and war-affected internally displaced persons are among those most seriously affected by a lack \nof  basic  urban  infrastructure.  Consumption  data  show  that  in  the  poorest  quintile  (average  monthly  household \nconsumption of SLRs821) only 61% have access to safe drinking water compared with the richest quintile with 89% \nhaving access; only 55% of the poorest quintile have access to safe sanitation compared with 89% in the richest, and only \n84% of the poorest quintile have access to latrines compared with 94% in the richest. \n \nThe disparity in household incomes is growing. The Gini concentration ratiob increased from 0.43 in 1980 to 0.47 in 2002. \nIncome varies widely between urban and rural areas with average monthly household income in the rural areas of \nSLRs11,712 (2002)\u2014only half of its urban counterpart SLRs22,420 (2002). Intraprovincial inequality is high: the average \nhousehold monthly income of the poorest province of Sabaragamuwa (SLRs8,439) is only 48% that of its Western \nProvince counterpart (SLRs17,732). Basic urban infrastructure is  unequally distributed.  This exacerbates the slow \neconomic growth and social development experienced by poor regions. The higher degrees of poverty experienced in \nSabaragamuwa, Uwa, and conflict-affected northeast provinces illustrates this. Most of these areas are considered rural \nand are administered by rural local authorities (LAs) or pradeshiya sabhas. More than 80% of Sri Lanka\u2019s poor live in \npradeshiya sabahs. While national average levels of access to basic urban infrastructure, access to safe sanitation, \ndrinking water, toilets, and health services is low, these are even poorer in pradeshiya sabahs, especially when compared \nto that in urban and relatively developed regions such as Western Province. \n \nImproving basic urban infrastructure will result in directly reducing nonincome poverty, and is likely to result in indirectly \nreducing income poverty through human development and associated economic growth. The Project is designed to assist \nselected LAs in developing management capabilities, and strengthening capacity in the delivery of community-prioritized \nbasic urban services. It will also improve and expand basic urban infrastructure and services particularly in the categories \nof (i) community water supply and sanitation, (ii) access and LA roads, (iii) solid waste management, (iv) drainage \nimprovements, and (v) institutional infrastructure (health, education, common community facilities, and administrative \nfacilities).  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                     Proposed Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nNationally, the poverty headcount does not appear very high at 22.7%. However, large differences in poverty are found \nacross the country. The poverty levels for rural and urban populations for example are 24.7% and 7.9%, respectively. \nSome differences are found in income inequality between rural and urban areas with Gini concentration ratios of 0.46 and \n0.48, respectively. In 2002, poverty headcounts in the region varied. The lowest level of poverty was in the Western \nProvince, where the poverty headcount was only 9.2%. In comparison, the poverty in Uva was 31.8%, Sabaragamuwa \n28.9%, Southern 23.6%, North Western 22.3%, Central 20.8%, and North Central 18.1%.c When examined by district, the \nvariability increases further with poverty headcounts ranging from 32.4% in Moneragalato 5.0% in Colombo; and Gini \nconcentration ratios ranging from 0.56 in Moneragala to 0.40 in Nuwara Eliya, Hambantota, and Polonnaruwa.  \n \nAside from the relatively high levels of poverty and income inequality in certain districts and provinces, the income \nstructure is such that a large number of the population are near-poverty. When poverty is defined using two poverty lines, \n1996 data show that a higher poverty line of SLRs950 classifies 26% as poor; while a lower poverty line of SLRs791 \nclassifies 19% as poor.d This shows that although the number of core poor may not be so high, a large number of near-", "52        Appendix 10 \npoor are highly vulnerable. This is significant considering the high dependence on the primary sector, and one event such \nas a natural calamity can result in poverty due to loss of productive assets.  \n \nThis vulnerability is further aggravated by the lack of basic urban infrsstructure. A high degree of nonincome poverty \nresults from the lack of basic urban infrastructure; access varies widely across provinces and districts. Using water and \nsanitation as an example, while 95.8% of the population in Colombo have access to safe drinking water, only 58.6% of the \npopulation in Ratnapura have access.e Similarly 97.6% of the population in Matara have latrine facilities while only 28.4% \nin Batticaloa have such facilities.  \n \nA field-level analysis was conducted in 22 LAs through (i) information collection from LAs; (ii) key informant interviews in \nLAs; (iii) focus group discussions with stakeholders including subproject beneficiaries, community-based and other civic \norganizations,  and  basic  urban  service  providers;  (iv)  participatory  needs  assessment  aimed  at  identifying  basic \ninfrastructure needs and priorities; (v) strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats analysis involving stakeholders; and (vi) \nquestionnaire for potential beneficiaries. The analysis shows that poor households have very limited access to basic urban \ninfrastructure. For example, the analysis shows that a third of the lowest-income households, with average monthly \nhousehold incomes of less than SLRs1,000, have no access to safe drinking water. Of these low-income households only \n50% had access to sanitation.  \n \nParticipatory assessment identifies improved drinking water supply and access roads for improved economic opportunities \nas the most important needs of LAs, particularly in rural areas. Eight of 22 LAs surveyed (37%) identified water supply as \ntheir first priority while 18% identified access roads. The lack of access to safe drinking water required households to \nspend considerable time and effort in fetching water. This burden was especially pronounced for poor households and \nfemale members of these households. Public health issues arise from the use of unprotected water sources for drinking\u2014\nthis increases the burden on poor households. Inadequate access roads limit the marketing of produce from poor \ncommunities. The lack of access roads also increases the difficulties in accessing basic urban infrastructure such as \nhealth centers and schools. Children in poor communities walk several kilometers to attend school. The participatory \nneeds assessment also identified the need for sanitation, drainage, improved solid waste management, and improved \ninstitutional infrastructure.  \n \nBy strengthening LA capacity and providing basic urban infrastructure, an enabling environment will be created for \ndelivering basic infrastructure services in a sustained manner. The Project\u2019s LA selection criteria ensure that the Project \nwill consider and prioritize LAs where poverty is high and basic infrastructure services are lacking. The Project provides \ndirect benefits through increased access to basic urban infrastructure and services, and enhances the potential for \ninvestments and economic growth in poor areas. Key  benefits expressed by stakeholders include enabling small \nproducers to market products without experiencing hardships and exploitation from agents and reduced social exclusion \nwith increased transportation and mobility from access roads; increased time for productive labor for income generation; \nand improved health from improved access to drinking water. Solid waste subprojects will provide better waste disposal \nfacilities to nearly half of the LA population. Water supply and sanitation subprojects are aimed at serving at least one fifth \nof the LA population currently severely constrained due to lack of access to or the poor quality of current infrastructure and \nservices. The Project, through the provision of basic urban infrastructure and services, will promote human development \nenvisioned to enable the poor to take advantage of potential social and economic resources and opportunities. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis:                           Yes     No \n \nExtensive community consultation was undertaken in 22 representative LAs. This included (i) information collection from \nLAs; (ii) key informant interviews in 22 LAs; (iii) focus group discussions in 22 LAs involving 357 stakeholders such as \nsubproject beneficiaries (including potentially vulnerable groups such as poor and low income groups); nongovernment, \ncommunity-based, and other civic organizations; and basic urban service providers; (iv) participatory needs assessment \naimed at identifying basic infrastructure needs and priorities through 16 group discussions; (v) analysis of strengths, \nweaknesses,  opportunities,  and threats in 12 LAs  involving stakeholders; and (vi)  questionnaire  for 234  potential \nbeneficiaries. These activities aimed at ascertaining stakeholders\u2019 response to improved infrastructure services; the \ncommunities\u2019 needs and demands; affordability; and impacts on women, indigenous people, estate plantation workers, \ndifferent ethnicities, small farmers, and other disadvantaged groups. Community and stakeholder consultations reveal the \nfollowing: (i) better access roads will give the poor access to services, decrease travel time, and provide better access to \nmarkets and educational facilities; this is perceived as a major project benefit; (ii) safe drinking water saves time for \nwomen for additional income-earning opportunities, and improve health and hygienic conditions; these are perceived to be \nmajor project benefits; (iii) communities are prepared to pay for improved services, and the operation and maintenance of \nsubprojects; and (iv) they perceive that increased access to services will reduce poverty and improve quality of life.

During \nthe social analysis, community preferences were identified. Local participation in the subprojects through active civic and \ncommunity-based  organizations  will  be  encouraged.  During  the  field  analysis  some  active  local  nongovernment \norganizations were found to be engaged in solid waste management, recycling, and implementation of low-cost sanitation \nand toilet facilities in some LAs. Beneficiary participation and the involvement of all stakeholders including nongovernmen, \ncivic, and community-based organizations will promote a bottom- up participatory process, proven effective and successful \nin other ongoing aid-supported projects in the sector.   \n \n \nD.  Gender and Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nNational indicators show that women in Sri Lanka have an equivalent status to men in terms of education (literacy rate for \nwomen is 89.2% compared with men at 92.3%; net enrolment ratio for girls is 95.6% for ages 6\u201310 and 97.1% for boys), \nhealth (life expectancy is 76.4 for women, 71.7 for men; infant mortality is 15.6 per 1,000 girls, 22.6 per 1,000 boys), and \npoverty (percentage of poor households headed by women is 21.5% compared with 23.0% for households headed by \nmen). However, the labor force participation rate for women is only 33.6% compared with 67.9% for men, and female \nprofessional and technical workers comprise only 22.9% of total workers. \n \nFocus group discussions and field investigations show that in the project areas, women bear the primarily responsibility for \nmanaging the domestic environment. Their tasks include water collection and ensuring solid waste disposal. The Project \nwill benefit women largely through reduced time for collecting water and other household chores related to disposing of \nsolid waste. This reduces their burden from manual work, increases time for productive activities, which will raise \nhousehold income and potentially their status in the household, and increase social and leisure time. Other externally \nsupported projects (including United Nations Development Programme and United Nations-Habitat Sustainable Cities \nProgram) in Sri Lanka have consistently demonstrated that women in poverty reduction programs involving water supply, \nsanitation, and microfinance have elicited women\u2019s active participation and benefited women. Other benefits from the \nProject are likely to benefit women and men equally. Subproject design will ensure women are provided equal access to \npotential skills training and employment opportunities, and promote women\u2019s active participation in community-based \nbasic urban infrastructure provision and management. \n \nHas an output been prepared?
