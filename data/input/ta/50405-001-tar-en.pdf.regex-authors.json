INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will strengthen, broaden, and \nsustain the growth of Asian bond markets by disseminating information on the region\u2019s bond \nmarkets, creating knowledge products, and engaging in capacity-building activities. The activities \nare expected to contribute to more informed and better functioning bond markets that lead to \nincreased regional monetary and financial cooperation and integration in the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN)+3.1 All activities will be undertaken in support of the Asian \nBond Markets Initiative (ABMI), including its medium-term road map that was approved in \nMay 2016.2 \n \n2.  The TA is included in the management-approved annual work program for the Economic \nResearch and Regional Cooperation Department as a research activity on monitoring financial \nsector conditions, especially bond market developments.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The painful experience of the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis suggests that strengthening \nlocal currency bond markets is critical to better balanced, more stable, and resilient financial \nsectors in the region by mitigating exposures to potentially volatile foreign currency borrowings. \nBroad,  deep,  and  liquid  local  currency  bond  markets  help  alleviate  duration  and  currency \nmismatches\u2014the double mismatch that lay at the heart of the Asian financial crisis\u2014with a more \nstable local currency financing. During the global financial crisis of 2007\u20132009, the availability of \nfinancing from local currency bond markets helped Asia cope relatively well with severe global \nliquidity stress. \n \n4.  While the region\u2019s bond markets have made substantial progress since the inception of \nthe ABMI in 2003, regional monetary and financial cooperation and integration remain immature.  \nThis is evident in the small investor base of the region\u2019s bond markets and the vulnerability of \nregional financial markets to external shocks. Active investor participation and well-balanced \ninvestor profiles improve financial market depth and increase market resilience to external shocks. \n \n5.  The limited regional monetary and financial cooperation and integration can be partly \nattributed to the lack of information and knowledge about local currency bond markets. To foster \na  better  understanding  of  local  currency  bond  markets,  the  following  three  areas  would \nhelp: (i) provide up-to-date and comprehensive information on local currency bond market data \nand regulatory frameworks, which is useful and relevant to investors, government policy makers, \nand other stakeholders; (ii) produce policy-oriented research and knowledge products on local \ncurrency bond markets; and (iii) strengthen institutional capacity in less developed bond markets \nvia capacity-building activities to develop well-functioning bond markets. To this end, activities \nunder the TA\u2014disseminating information on the region\u2019s bond markets through the Asian Bonds \nOnline  (ABO)  website,  creating  knowledge  products,  and  engaging  in  capacity-building \nactivities\u2014will continue to contribute to bigger, deeper, and more liquid bond markets.  \n \n \n                                                \n1  ASEAN+3 comprises the 10 member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. \n2  Asian Bond Markets Initiative. https://asianbondsonline.adb.org/regional/abmi.php. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 September 2017. The TA concept \npaper was approved on 16 June 2017 by ADB\u2019s vice-president for knowledge management and sustainable \ndevelopment. \n ", "2 \n6.  This TA expands and upgrades the work done in earlier TA projects.4 It enhances existing \nwork by incorporating up-to-date technical and market advances into information dissemination \nand knowledge production activities. The ABO website has established a robust framework for \ndata provision and knowledge and information dissemination, and is widely used by market \nparticipants within and outside the region. Other international financial institutions recognized \nABO as a model local currency bond information portal in November 2011 when the G205 \nendorsed an action plan to support the development of local currency bond markets.  \n \n7.  All  TA  activities  will  be  undertaken  in  support  of  the  ABMI  of  ASEAN+3,  in  close \nconsultation with its officials. According to the ABMI\u2019s medium-term road map, the ABMI will \ncontinue to support information dissemination on local currency bond markets through ABO as \none of the key activities under the ABMI Task Force 2. Further, ABO can address inadequate \ninformation on bond markets by lowering information costs for users with limited data access. In \ndoing  so,  ABO  will  contribute  to  the  formation  of  a  regional  information  platform  as  a \ncomplementary activity under the ABMI Task Force 3.  \n \n8.  This TA\u2019s objective of strengthening regional monetary and financial cooperation and \nintegration is in line with Strategy 20206 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The Midterm \nReview of Strategy 20207 recognizes that regional cooperation and integration will remain an \nimportant strategic agenda for ADB. Further, ADB will continue to facilitate financial and monetary \ncooperation by drawing on its experience in the ASEAN and ASEAN+3 subregions, and support \nASEAN+3  subregional  initiatives,  including  the  ABMI.  The  TA  is  relevant  to  the  Regional \nCooperation and Integration Strategy8 under pillar 3: monetary and financial cooperation. It is \naligned  with  the  Operational  Plan  for  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration9,  particularly \noperational direction 2 on raising competitiveness in connected markets by strengthening regional \nmonetary and financial cooperation and supporting regional capital market development. The TA \nmay be relevant to Strategy 2030 (under preparation), which indicates ADB\u2019s support for private \nsector development, including mobilizing private resources for development\u2014highlighting the \nimportance of strengthening Asian bond markets. It also contributes to ADB\u2019s role as catalyst of \nfinance and coordinator for regional cooperation and integration. \n   \n                                                \n4  The earlier phase of the ABO data portal was conducted under the following TA projects: ADB. 2003.

The TA is aligned with the following impact: enhanced regional monetary and financial \ncooperation in the ASEAN+3 region with strengthened integration will have the following outcome: \nenhanced market accessibility and lower informational barriers to global and regional investors in \nAsian bond markets, as more transparent information on the bonds market are made available \nwith no costs10.  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n10.  The TA will support the ABMI to conduct activitiesunder the New Medium-Term Road Map \n \nTask  Force  2,  which  facilitates  the  demand  of  local  currency-denominated  bonds,  and \ncomplement the ABMI Task Force 3 on strengthening the regulatory framework.  \n \n11.  Output 1: Asian Bonds Online website and database maintained well and enhanced. \nThe first output will cover, among others: (i) major features of local currency bond markets; \n(ii) credible market data, such as the daily Market Watch for each economy, Credit Risk Watch \non market risks and volatility, and data from bond pricing agencies obtained through the ABMI; \n(iii) research papers, news articles, and commentary; (iv) specialized bond segments, such as \nIslamic bonds (sukuk) and dim sum bonds; and (v) updates on ASEAN+3 ABMI activities. Website \nappearance, content, and user interface will be substantially upgraded to improve user experience. \nThe ABO website will be well maintained and enhanced regularly to cater to new online platforms \nfor faster information updates and downloads. \n \n12.  Output 2: Asia Bond Monitor and research papers on emerging East Asian local \ncurrency  bond  markets  published  and  disseminated.  The  second  output  consists  of \npublication of knowledge products\u2014Asia Bond Monitor (ABM) and research papers on emerging \nEast Asian local currency bond markets\u2014and their dissemination. The quarterly ABM is an ADB \nflagship report on finance that uses bond market data from the ABO and contains a section on \npolicy and regulatory developments and individual market summaries for nine economies. The \nTA will produce research papers on emerging East Asian local currency bond markets that \nexamine critical issues affecting local bond market development. The ABM and research papers \nwill be published digitally on the ABO website, but a very limited number of hard copies of the \nABM will be printed for exclusive distribution at the ABM launch events and to various institutions \nin the region that have limited access to the internet. The TA will also be involved in preparing \nbackground studies on special topics relating to financial markets. \n \n13.  Output 3: Capability of government officials involved in bond market development \nincreased. The third output will be achieved through customized in-country training courses and \nseminars  for  developing  member  countries\u2019  government  officials  involved  in  bond  market \ndevelopment.  Individual  country  training  will  involve  about  30  middle-management  national \nofficials from each country and staff of the ministries of finance and other capital market and \nfinancial  supervisory  agencies  in  developing  member  countries  with  less  developed  bond \nmarkets\u2014Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam. The \nworkshops will include action planning and formulation of strategies to overcome impediments to \nbond market development. A typical workshop will cover countries\u2019 experience of other emerging \n                                                \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nAsian bond markets, thematic issues about bond market development, basic bond market \nknowledge, and ABO website tutorials that will aid the creation of a bond database. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nInvestment Climate Facilitation Fund11 under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing \n \nPartnership Facility and administered by ADB. Appendix 2 lists the key expenditure items. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  Implementation will be in accordance with the 2017 Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction \npolicy guidelines.12 ADB will administer the TA.
