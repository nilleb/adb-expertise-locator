To \nbe  included  in  the  Project,  municipalities  (Pourashavas)  are \nrequired to implement an Urban Governance Improvement Action \nProgram (UGIAP). Initially, Pourashavas will be given limited funds \nto cover the most urgent investment requirements.  The continuing \nparticipation in the sector Project, however, will depend on the \nactual progress made with the implementation of the UGIAP by the \nparticipating  municipalities.  This  suggests  a  significant \nimprovement from the previous approach, in which all investment \ncomponents were predetermined at the time of project appraisal \nand the participating Pourashavas were left unaccountable for their \nperformance  during  project  implementation.  The  blueprint \napproach adopted in the past has clearly failed in its commitment \nto bring about sustainable improvements in urban management \nbecause  of  the  basically  supply-driven  nature  of  resource \nallocation.  Thus,  a  performance-based  sector  approach  is \nemployed under the Project, involving demand-driven allocation of \nloan proceeds that is based on clearly defined performance criteria \nand the commitment to undertake governance reform. \n \nRationale  Recent  experience  in  Bangladesh  suggests  that  urbanization \nneeds to be seen in a positive light. The poverty reducing potential \nof  well-planned  and  decentralized  urbanization  is  immense, \nespecially  in  the  longer  term.  However,  unplanned  and \nuncontrolled urbanization creates tremendous pressure on basic \nurban infrastructure and eventually limits the growth potential of the \nnational economy. Moreover, the concentration of population and \nactivities in a few metropolitan areas tends to further aggravate \nurban  environmental  conditions  in  the  absence  of  adequate \ncapacities to manage urban growth. Recognizing diseconomies of \ncongestion and environmental degradation in metropolitan cities, \nthe  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  continue  to  provide \nassistance to the urban sector for rehabilitation and expansion of \nurban development and services in Pourashavas throughout the \ncountry, and to further assist in decentralization and strengthening \nof urban governance. \n ", "iv \nObjectives and Scope  The Project will assist the selected Pourashavas to (i) enhance \naccountability  in  municipal  management  and  strengthen \ncapabilities in the provision of municipal services, and (ii) develop \nand expand physical infrastructure and urban services to increase \neconomic  opportunities,  and  to  reduce  vulnerability  to \nenvironmental  degradation,  poverty,  and  natural  hazards.  The \nProject will also promote the active participation of women citizens \nin municipal management and services as well as upgrade the \nconditions of the poorest and most needy groups in the slum area. \n \n  The Project comprises three parts: Part A, Urban Infrastructure \nImprovement, covers the improvement/expansion of the following \nmunicipal infrastructure facilities: (i) roads and bridges, (ii) storm \nwater  drainage,  (iii)  low-cost  sanitation,  (iv)  solid  waste \nmanagement, (v) municipal facilities (e.g., bus and truck terminals, \nkitchen markets, and slaughterhouses) and (vi) slum improvement. \nUnder  specific  circumstances  inclusion  of  water  supply \nrehabilitation schemes will also be considered. \n   \nPart B, Urban Governance Improvement, includes implementation \nof an action program in five key result areas: (i) citizen awareness \nand participation; (ii) women\u2019s participation; (iii) integration of the \nurban poor; (iv) financial accountability and sustainability; and (v) \nadministrative  transparency.  In  each  of  these  five  areas,  the \nPourashavas will need to achieve well-defined performance targets \nthat  will  be  closely  monitored  and  evaluated  during  project \nimplementation. \n   \nPart C, Capacity Building and Implementation Assistance, covers \n(i) project management, detailed engineering design, construction \nsupervision, nongovernment organization support to community-\nbased activities, and facilitation of community mobilization; and (ii) \ninstitutional  capacity-building  programs  for  Pourashavas  to \nsuccessfully  implement  the  UGIAP,  including  (a)  an  orientation \nprogram for Pourashava chairpersons and ward commissioners, \n(b) a tailored program for female ward commissioners, (c) training \nprograms for municipal secretaries to implement the community-\nbased  activities  under  the  UGIAP,  (d)  computerization  of  tax \nrecords  and  billing,  (e)  computerization  of  accounting \nmanagement, (f) infrastructure inventory assessment and mapping,  \nand (g) training for decentralized township planning. \n \nCost Estimates  The Project will cost approximately $87 million equivalent, $21.5 \nmillion  equivalent  of  this  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $65.5 \nmillion equivalent in local currency costs.

The project director will be \ndirectly responsible for overall project implementation, monitoring, \nand supervision. PMO will have two deputy project directors, one \nfor technical, engineering, and supervision support; and one for \nenvironment,  sanitation,  and  slum  improvement.  In  each \nparticipating Pourashava, a project implementation unit (PIU) will \nbe  established,  headed  by  the  pourashava  chairperson  and \ncomprising three sections: (i) Infrastructure Improvement Section; \n(ii) Environment, Sanitation and Slum Improvement Section; and \n(iii) Urban Governance Improvement Section. ", "vi \n   \nTraining capacities at LGED will be strengthened and transferred \ninto the national and regional urban management support units \n(UMSUs), which will be responsible for providing comprehensive \ntraining  and  institutional  support,  in  the  first  instance,  to  all \nCategory A and larger Category B Pourashavas. \n   \nProcurement  Goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Since the contracts for civil works will \nbe small and widely dispersed, international competitive bidding \n(ICB)  is  not  considered  appropriate.  Consequently,  all  the  civil \nworks contracts will be procured on the basis of local competitive \nbidding  among  prequalified  contractors  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s procurement procedures acceptable to ADB. Each \nsupply  contract  for  equipment  or  materials  estimated  to  cost \n$500,000 or more will be awarded on the basis of ICB, and those \ncosting less than the equivalent of $500,000 (other than minor \nitems) but more than $100,000 will be awarded on the basis of \ninternational shopping. Direct purchase procedures will be used for \nsmall or off-the-shelf items valued at less than $100,000.  \n \nConsulting Services  Consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB. A total of 4,006 person-months \nof consulting services (59 international and 3,947 domestic) will be \nrequired. Five packages of consulting services will be provided \nunder the Project: two for the national UMSU (governance program \ndevelopment,  and  performance  evaluation  and  monitoring)  and \nthree  for  the  PMO  (management,  design  and  supervision, \nmonitoring and evaluation, and facilitation of UGIAP activities). The \nconsultants will support the UMSU and PMO/PIUs and will transfer \nproject management and technical skills to the government staff. \n   \nDisbursement  The civil works contracts to be awarded will generally be small in \nvalue and involve a large number of contractors and suppliers. To \nensure effective Project implementation and timely disbursement, \nthe Government will establish an imprest account in the name of \nthe  Project  at  the  Bangladesh  Bank  immediately  after  the \neffectiveness  of  the  Loan  Agreement.  Payments  for  civil  works \ncontracts will be made through this account for eligible payments \nunder the Project. The statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure \nwill be adopted to facilitate reimbursement and liquidation of small \ncontracts. The imprest account and the SOE procedure will be \nestablished, maintained, and audited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook. The initial advance to the imprest \naccount will correspond to 6 months of estimated ADB-financed \nexpenditures to be paid from this account. The SOE procedure is \napplicable only to payments below $50,000 equivalent. \n ", "vii \nImplementation Period  Based  on  the  experience  of  Secondary  Towns  Infrastructure \nand Startup Activities  Development I and II, and in view of the sector modality of the \nProject,  and  the  large  number  and  geographical  spread  of \nparticipating Pourashavas, the Project will be implemented over a \nperiod of 6 years. Implementation is expected to commence in the \nsecond quarter of 2003. Start-up activities (after Loan Approval) \nwill  include  the  following:  (i)  establishment  of  the  national  and \nregional UMSUs (LGED); (ii) recruitment of project staff for the \nPMO  and  PIUs  (LGED  and  Pourashavas);  (iii)  selection  and \nrecruitment  of  consultants  (LGED);  (iv)  preparation  of  strategic \ndevelopment vision (Pourashavas); (v) preparation of subproject \nappraisal  reports  for  the  Phase  1  work  program  (LGED  and \nPourashavas);  and  (vi)  procurement  of  immediately  required \nequipment (LGED). Physical works may not start before the fourth \nquarter of 2003 due to the need to undertake extensive surveys \nand prepare detailed engineering designs and contract documents. \n   \nProject Benefits and  All current 1,836,000 citizens of the project towns, representing \nBeneficiaries  around 6% of the total urban population are expected to benefit, \ndirectly or indirectly, from the Project. This will be achieved mainly \nthrough  improvement  of  basic  urban  infrastructure  facilities \nincluding roads (400 kilometers [km] and at least 25 bridges) and \ndrainage systems (260 km). Regarding the latter, it is expected that \naround  650,000  people  will  benefit  from  reduced  flooding  and \ngreater  productivity.  Particular  attention  will  also  be  given  to \nimproving  the  living  conditions  of  the  urban  poor  (estimated \n120,000  people  or  around  7%  of  the  beneficiaries),  through \ncommunity-based  environmental  improvement  works  and  slum \nimprovement activities. Further, the implementation of the Project \nwill require almost 10,000 person-years of unskilled laborers of \nwhich at least one third will be women. Through the provision of \nmicrocredit,  income-generating  activities  will  be  supported  in \nparticularly for women in low-income areas. \n \n  It is estimated that, upon completion of the Project (2009), around \n20,000 households will have improved domestic sanitary facilities, \nwhile  the  general  public  will  have  better  access  to  community \ntoilets. Improved solid waste management (currently around 50% \nof the waste is collected and disposed of) will improve health and \nenvironmental  conditions.  The  planning  assumption  is  that,  in \n2011, all Pourashavas should have the facilities to reach a waste \ncollection and disposal efficiency of at least 70%.  \n \nRisks and Assumptions  While no unusual risks are foreseen during implementation, the \npotential risks concern (i) delays in implementation due to slow \nprogress  with  start-up  activities;  (ii)  lack  of  suitably  qualified \npersonnel in the Pourashavas which may eventually lead to weak \nimplementation of subprojects at the Pourashava level; and (iii) \nsustainability  of  the  facilities  and  services  provided  under  the \nProject. ", "viii \nTechnical Assistance  The accompanying TA for Supporting Urban Governance Reform \nwill  provide  necessary  technical  and  secretarial  support  to  the \nCommittee on Urban Local Governments in the key policy areas \nthat  were  identified  during  the  policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment: (i) in consultation with various stakeholders in the \nurban sector, prepare the National Urban Sector Policy for cabinet \napproval,  containing  recommendations,  among  others,  on  the \napproach to be followed in the process and pattern of urbanization \nin Bangladesh; (ii) review the existing holding tax system in the \ncountry and suggest reforms for improving collection of holding \ntaxes from public and private sector entities as well as solving the \nproblem  of  recurrent  arrears  of  such  taxes;  (iii)  make \nrecommendations  for  the  amendment  of  the  1977  Pourashava \nOrdinance to reflect the needs for improved local governance and \nbetter urban management; and (iv) review the Government\u2019s long-\nterm strategy for municipal development (covering upazila towns \nand  Pourashavas)  and  make  recommendations  for  preparing  a \nmaster plan for future development of these key urban centers. \n \nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $520,000 equivalent. ADB \nwill finance $400,000 equivalent, on a grant basis, covering all the \nforeign exchange costs ($85,000) and part of local costs from the \nADB-funded TA program. \n \nThe Committee will be supported by a full time secretariat to be \nestablished at LGED, under the overall supervision of the secretary \nof LGD. The LGD will be the executing agency. \n   \n ", " ", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Urban  Governance  and  Infrastructure \nImprovement (Sector) Project. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for \nSupporting Urban Governance Reform, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  Recognizing diseconomies of congestion and environmental degradation in metropolitan \ncities,  the  Government  has  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  continue  to \nprovide assistance to the urban sector for rehabilitation and expansion of urban development \nand services in secondary towns (Pourashavas) throughout the country, and to further assist in \nthe decentralization and strengthening of urban governance. In response, ADB provided two \nproject preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)1 grants to undertake a feasibility study and \nproject preparation. This Report is based on the findings of these PPTAs, and the discussions \nwith all stakeholders during the TA review, loan fact-finding, and appraisal missions.2 The \nproject framework is in Appendix 1, which summarizes the objectives, scope, and approach of \nthe Project.  \n \nA.  Urban Sector Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n3.  Urbanization. In 2001, the total urban population in Bangladesh was about 30 million, \nrepresenting approximately 23% of the national population. While this level of urbanization is \nrelatively low by Asian standards, the urban population grew at an annual rate of about 3.5% in \n1991-2000, compared with the national population growth rate of 1.5%. The growth rates of \nPourashavas range from relatively low in most (at around 2%), to moderately high (up to 4.5%) \nin a few cases. The growth of the urban population in Bangladesh is mainly due to the growth of \nmetropolitan cities.  \n \n4.  Contribution to Economic Growth. Rapid urbanization has contributed to the growing \nshare of the urban sector in overall economic growth. Over 40% of the country's gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) is now derived from the urban sector, from a low of 25% in the early 1970s. The \nGovernment\u2019s Fifth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002) projected that the urban sector GDP would \ngrow at around 14% per annum, which is more than twice the growth target for the national \nGDP.    \n \n5.  Urban Poverty. The incidence of poverty in Bangladesh, as measured by the costs of \nbasic needs poverty line, fell from 58.8% in FY1992 to 49.8% in 2000. A sector breakdown \nshows that progress in reducing poverty was almost equal across urban and rural areas: the \nurban headcount ratio declined from 44.9% to 36.6% (by 8.3%) while rural poverty declined \nfrom 61.2% to 53.0% (by 8.2%). However, the moderate reduction in urban poverty during the \nlast decade was accompanied by a notable increase in urban income inequality, as the Gini \ncoefficient increased from 0.398 to 0.452.  \n \n6.  The situations have been somewhat different in the case of absolute numbers of the \npoor in urban and rural areas. In FY1992, the number of urban poor population was 6.5 million \nwhen total urban population was 14.6 million. This then increased to 9.3 million in 2000. Thus \nthere has been at least a 43% growth of the urban poor population during the last decade. The \n                                                 \n1\n  ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance to Bangladesh for Third Urban Development (TUDP). Manila. With a significant \ndelay in the processing of the subsequent loan project, ADB provided a follow-up TA in 2001 for  Urban \nGovernance and Infrastructure Improvement Project to update the findings of the earlier TA and reformulate the \nProject as a sector loan. \n2  Project processing chronology is included in Supplementary Appendix A. ", "2 \nrural poor population, on the other hand, recorded a decline in absolute number from 57.6 \nmillion to 53.5 million. The principal reason behind this phenomenon is the large-scale shift of \nthe rural population to the urban areas in the hope of better economic opportunities. If the \ncurrent trend of migration continues, the urban poor will increase to 25-30% of the country's total \npoor by 2020, if not more. These facts point to the growing need to address urban poverty both \nas an aspect of a new dimension of poverty (relative to rural poverty) and as a matter of \nincreasing priority to reducing poverty. \n \n7.  Urban Infrastructure and Basic Services.  There are deficiencies in all urban services. \nOnly 30% of urban households use tap water for drinking, and probably less than 20% have \ntheir own house connections. With the exception of a limited waterborne sewerage system in \nDhaka, no other urban center has any form of sewerage system. Solid waste collection levels \nare around 20%. Urban areas also suffer from severe traffic congestion and the absence of any \nform of mass public transit system. For most urban residents, housing conditions are very bad. \nOnly 25% of urban households live in dwellings with permanent structure.  Very high land prices, \ninsecurity of tenure, and a lack of housing finance have handicapped the growth of the formal \nsector of the housing market. In most urban centers, ambient air and water quality is extremely \npoor. The major sources of air pollution are traffic, brickfields, and industry. The major sources \nof water pollution are domestic and industrial wastewater discharges. Inadequate drainage \nincreases the exposure of the urban population to the effects of polluted water.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n  1.  Slow Progress in Policy and Institutional Reform \n \n8.  Recent experience in Bangladesh suggests that urbanization needs to be seen in a \npositive light. The poverty reducing potential of well-planned and decentralized urbanization is \nimmense, especially in the longer term. However, unplanned and uncontrolled urbanization \ncreates tremendous pressure on basic urban infrastructure and eventually limits the growth \npotential of the national economy. Moreover, the concentration of population and activities in a \nfew  metropolitan  areas  tends  to  further  aggravate  urban  environmental  conditions  in  the \nabsence of adequate capacity to manage urban growth (a summary of urban sector analysis is \npresented in Appendix 2).  \n \n9.  The  Government  is  therefore  developing  secondary  towns  to  improve  their  living \nstandards, particularly in the poorer areas, and to provide an alternative to those who would join \nthe migration to the larger metropolitan cities. ADB has been assisting the Government to \nachieve these goals since 1990 through the Secondary Towns Infrastructure Development \nProjects  I  and  II3 (STIDP  I  and  II).  So  far,  ADB  has  supported  upgrading  of  municipal \ninfrastructure facilities in 32 of 64 district towns in Bangladesh. The World Bank is currently \ncovering another 14 district towns under its Municipal Services Project (external assistance in \nthe sector is summarized in Appendix 3). With the implementation of the proposed Project, \nalmost all district towns in Bangladesh will be provided with necessary financial and technical \nassistance to improve basic urban infrastructure and management of urban affairs.   \n \n10.  The implementation of physical works under the past and ongoing projects has been \nsatisfactory. However, the progress in institutional reform, an integral part of all urban projects, \nhas  been  much  slower  than  originally  anticipated.  In  fact,  the  slow  progress  made  on \ninstitutional reform is a reflection of poor governance and lack of accountability on the side of \nthe participating municipalities in urban management. Good urban governance and effective \nmanagement are a prerequisite for well-functioning cities. Past experience shows that physical \ninfrastructure improvement cannot be sustained unless the underlying governance problems are \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1990.

Manila; ADB. 1995. \nReport and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of Bangladesh for the Secondary Towns Infrastructure Development Project II. Manila. ", "3 \naddressed first. For this reason, it was decided to redesign the earlier prepared Third Urban \nDevelopment Project and adopt a new performance-based approach in which participating \nmunicipalities  are  made  accountable  for  their  performance  in  implementing  action-based \nprograms for better urban governance.  \n \n  2.  Promoting Good Urban Governance \n \n11.  Urban governance is broadly defined as \"the sum of the many ways individuals and \ninstitutions, public and private, plan and manage the common affairs of the city.\u201d4 Two aspects \nof this broad definition need further elaboration. First, it indicates that urban governance is not \njust government. Governance as a concept recognizes that decision-making power to improve \nthe  affairs  of  the  city  exists  inside  and  outside  the  formal  authority  and  institutions  of \ngovernment. In other words, governance includes the government, private sector, and civil \nsociety.  The  second  aspect  emphasizes  that  urban  governance  is  a  \"process.\"  It  is  a \nparticipatory process through which diverse interests of the city may be accommodated and \ncooperative action can be taken.  \n \n12.  Through  extensive  interviews  and  consultations  with  the  Pourashavas  during  the \nimplementation of the PPTA, it became evident that most of the Project towns have a poor \nrecord in terms of public participation in urban management. Promoting decentralization of \nauthority and powers to Pourashavas will not produce any desirable result unless there is a \ncommensurate increase in the delegation of powers from the Pourashava chairpersons to \nelected commissioners and to citizen groups. The key to the gains in efficiency associated with \ndecentralization is the accountability of elected officials, especially the chairpersons, to local \nresidents. Increasing accountability will require more participation of citizens in Pourashava \naffairs.  \n \n13.  Overall,  there  are  two  outstanding  considerations  under  the  Project  for  improving \nPourashava governance: First is a concern for the concentration of authority and powers in the \nhands of the Pourashava chairperson, which results in poor performance, inefficiency, and lack \nof accountability, much to the detriment of good governance. The second is a concern for weak \ncapacity of elected commissioners, local public officials, and community groups; this becomes \nconcern for the limited scope for increasing the role of municipal council, and ward and citizens \ncommittees in running municipal affairs.  \n \n14.  To effectively address these main concerns, an Urban Governance Improvement Action \nProgram (UGIAP) has been developed in close consultation with the participating Pourashavas. \nOverall, the UGIAP comprises five subprograms: three for enhancing the awareness and the \nparticipation of local stakeholders in urban planning and management (citizen awareness and \nparticipation, women\u2019s participation, and integration of the urban poor) and two for improving \naccountability and transparency (financial accountability and sustainability, and administrative \ntransparency). Under these subprograms, Pourashavas will be asked to form town-level citizens \ncommittees, develop participatory municipal development plan, strengthen the role of female \nward  commissioners,  implement  poverty  reduction  action  programs,  operate  microcredit \nprogram for the poor women, and increase tax collection. \n \n15.  While the ultimate responsibility for urban governance rests with urban local bodies, the \nrole of the Central Government is also important. On the fiscal side, the Central Government \ndirectly supports centrally funded municipal projects and has statutory control over different \naspects of municipal revenues and expenditures. A central government ministry, Ministry of \nLocal  Government,  Rural  Development  and  Cooperatives  (MLGRDC),  is  responsible  for \nsupervision of municipal affairs, the scope of which includes demanding records, inspection of \nactivities, and revoking illegal orders and decisions of municipal governments. Given the large \nnumber of the central government agencies involved in planning, building, and managing urban \n                                                 \n4  UN-Habitat definition of good urban governance. ", "4 \ninfrastructure, the review of the functions and structure of the central government ministries and \nagencies in urban development is included under the project\u2019s accompanying TA. The focus of \nthe review is based on the principle that the role of central government agencies should be \nmore of facilitator or supporter than of doer or implementer for the sake of long-term benefit of \nthe local governments.     \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n16.  The primary objective of the Project is to promote human development and good urban \ngovernance in secondary towns of Bangladesh. To achieve this objective, the Project will assist \nthe  selected  Pourashavas  to  (i)  enhance  accountability  in  municipal  management  and \nstrengthen their capabilities in the provision of municipal services; and (ii) develop and expand \nphysical infrastructure and urban services to increase economic opportunities, and to reduce \nvulnerability to environmental degradation, poverty, and natural hazards. While the Project will \nbenefit the entire urban community in general, some of its components will focus on upgrading \nthe conditions of the poorest and most needy groups in the slum areas in particular. The Project \nwill also promote active participation of women citizens in municipal management and services \nas both beneficiaries and agents.    \n \n17.  The Project will use a performance-based sector loan approach. To be included in the \nProject,  municipalities  are  required  to  implement  the  UGIAP.  Initially,  all  participating \nPourashavas will be given limited funds to cover the most urgent investment requirements.  The \ncontinuing participation in the sector Project, however, will depend on the actual progress made \nwith the implementation of the UGIAP. This suggests a significant improvement from a previous \napproach  in  which  all  investment  components  were  predetermined  at  the  time  of  project \nappraisal and the participating Pourashavas were left unaccountable for their performance \nduring project implementation. Such a blueprint approach adopted in the past has failed in its \ncommitment to bring about sustainable improvements in urban management because of the \nbasically supply-driven nature of resource allocation. Thus, an alternative approach is employed \nunder the Project, involving demand-driven allocation of loan proceeds, which is based on \nclearly defined performance criteria and the commitment to undertake governance reform. \n \nB.  Sector Loan Approach     \n \n18.  The Project is formulated as a sector loan based on the Government\u2019s sector investment \nplan for Pourashavas and will support a 6-year time and area slice of the plan, representing \n28% of estimated investment during 2003-2009 and covering about 22 Pourashavas. Overall, \nthe Project meets the criteria for adopting a sector lending modality:5 (i) there is a strong sector \nagency, namely LGED, which has successfully implemented a number of urban projects funded \nby both domestic and external resources; (ii) MLGRDC has adopted a comprehensive Urban \nManagement Policy, which will guide urban development in the country; and (iii) a credible \nsector investment plan for Pourashavas (as provided in the Government\u2019s Annual Development \nPlan) exists, which has successfully guided sector development so far. \n \nC.  Components and Outputs \n \n19.  The Project comprises three parts. Part A: Urban Infrastructure Improvement covers the \nimprovement/expansion of the following municipal infrastructure facilities (i) roads and bridges, \n(ii) storm water drainage, (iii) low-cost sanitation, (iv) solid waste management, (v) municipal \n                                                 \n5 The  sector  loan  requirements  are  detailed  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B  (LGED  Operations  and  Vision), \nSupplementary Appendix C (Urban Management Policy Statement of MLGRDC), and Supplementary Appendix D \n(Sector Investment Plan). ", "5 \nfacilities (e.g., bus and truck terminals, kitchen markets, and slaughterhouses), and (vi) slum \nimprovement. Under specific circumstances, inclusion of water supply rehabilitation schemes \nwill also be considered.6 Part B: Urban Governance Improvement includes implementation of an \naction program in five key result areas: (i) citizen awareness and participation, (ii) women\u2019s \nparticipation, (iii) integration of the urban poor, (iv) financial accountability and sustainability, and \n(v) administrative transparency. In each of these five areas, the Pourashavas will need to \nachieve well-defined performance targets, which will be closely monitored and evaluated during \nproject implementation. Part C: Capacity Building and Implementation Assistance covers (i) \nproject management, detailed engineering design, construction supervision, nongovernment \norganization  (NGO)  support  to  community-based  activities,  and  facilitation  of  community \nmobilization; and (ii) institutional capacity building programs for Pourashavas to successfully \nimplement the UGIAP, including (a) an orientation program for Pourashava chairpersons and \nward  commissioners,  (b)  a  tailored  program  for  female  ward  commissioners,  (c)  training \nprograms for secretaries to implement the community-based activities under the UGIAP, (d) \ncomputerization of tax records and billing, (e) computerization of accounting management, (f) \ninfrastructure inventory assessment and mapping,  and (g) training for decentralized township \nplanning. \n \n  1.  Part A: Urban Infrastructure Improvement \n \n20.  Funds will be made available to the Pourashavas under Part A: Urban Infrastructure \nImprovement in three phases that coincide with performance under Part B: Urban Governance \nImprovement.  For  the  Part  A  investments,  each  Pourashava  will  prepare  a  subproject \ncomprising a package of urban infrastructure improvements. The following components will be \neligible for financing under each subproject. \n \n    a.  Roads and Bridges \n \n21.  The component will include the improvement of the Pourashavas\u2019 road networks and \ntraffic circulation, largely through the rehabilitation, repair, and widening of existing roads within \nthe urban core area, traffic management improvements, and procurement of equipment to keep \nthe road system in a good condition.  \n \nb.  Stormwater Drainage \n \n22.  The stormwater drainage improvements are intended to alleviate major inundation from \nrainfall and reduce waterlogging problems within the core urban area of the Pourashava. The \nworks  include  (i)  elimination  of  all  blockages/obstructions  and  encroachments  on  existing \ndrainage paths, (ii) cleaning and rehabilitation of existing drains, (iii) construction of new drains \nto serve previously unserviced areas, and (iv) construction of missing links.  \n \nc.  Low-Cost Sanitation \n \n23.  The sanitation component comprises a program for the provision of double-vault pit \nlatrines and the construction of public toilet blocks. It is proposed to construct a total of about \n12,000 household or private double-vault pit latrines, and 84 public toilets.  \n                                                 \n6  Water supply components will consist mainly of rehabilitation of the water supply systems and provision of \nequipment for operation and maintenance. Given the widespread arsenic contamination of groundwater in the \ncountry, the implementation of any tubewell works will be strictly in line with the Government\u2019s guidelines and \nstandards for the development of deep tubewells. No shallow tubewell work will be undertaken under the Project \ndue to possible arsenic contamination. If the scope of the water supply work exceeds normal rehabilitation of the \nsystem, the implementation of the water supply component may be referred to the Department of Public Health \nEngineering with LGED as an implementing agency. ", "6 \n \nd.  Solid Waste Management \n \n24.  This component will improve collection efficiencies to 70% of household wastes and \n95% of other (commercial, institutional, and hospital) wastes within the core urban areas, and \nensure improved arrangements for disposal. The component will provide for the procurement of \ngarbage  trucks,  pushcarts,  and  communal  concrete  garbage  bins  in  order  to  improve  the \nstorage and collection of wastes. Landfill sites will be developed to facilitate controlled disposal \nof the waste. \n \ne.  Municipal Facilities \n \n25.  To promote economic and commercial development in the towns and encourage public-\nprivate partnerships, it is proposed to construct, extend or rehabilitate bus terminals, kitchen \nmarkets, and slaughterhouses in the Pourashavas. In a Pourashava where there is an acute \nneed for additional parking facilities for trucks, and where there is very limited land available, it \nis proposed to construct a truck terminal. \n \n \nf.  Slum Upgrading \n \n26.  A component for the provision of services to the urban poor will be implemented in each \nPourashava. The component is expected to assist about 18,000 slum families (120,000 slum \ndwellers) through the improvement of overall living conditions using an integrated approach that \nincludes provision of basic urban services (e.g., access, water supply, drainage, sanitation, and \nsolid waste management), and supporting health and literacy development activities.  \n \n2.  Part B: Urban Governance Improvement  \n \n27.  Local level reform will be implemented through the UGIAP. In exchange for receiving \nfinancial assistance under the Project, Pourashavas will enter into a subproject agreement with \nthe Government represented by LGED to implement the action program in five key result areas. \nThe implementation of the UGIAP will be in three phases over 6 years. It will take 2 years to \ncomplete each phase. The receipt by Pourashavas of funds for subprojects under Part A: Urban \nInfrastructure Improvement during the second and third phases will depend on performance \nunder Part B.  \n \na.  Phase 1 \n \n28.  All 22 Pourashavas identified under the PPTA will be included in phase 1 and they will \nsign a subproject agreement with the Government to participate in phase 1. While undertaking \nthe urban infrastructure improvement components for phase 1, the Pourashavas will be required \nto carry out various reform activities as stipulated in the UGIAP (Appendix 4), with assistance \nfrom LGED. The performance of the Pourashavas will be closely monitored by the Government \nand ADB to determine their eligibility for phase 2 of the Project. The investment ceiling for \nimplementation of the urban infrastructure components in phase 1 is set at around 25-30% of \nthe total investment requirement assessed for each Pourashava during the PPTA. During the \nfield  visits  under  TA.  No  36907,  high  priority  investment  components  for  phase  1  (mainly \nrehabilitation work for roads and drainage systems) were identified and confirmed with the \nPourashavas (Appendix 5).   \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to Bangladesh for Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement Project. \nManila. ", "7 \n    b.  Phase 2 \n \n29.  At the end of phase 1, each Pourashava will be evaluated by the Government and ADB \nfor its performance in achieving targets under the UGIAP. If a Pourashava fails to meet any of \nthe minimum performance targets specified in the UGIAP, it will not be allowed to proceed to the \nsecond phase. On the other hand, those Pourashavas that meet the minimum performance \ntargets will be further rated into two groups \u2212 fully satisfactory (i.e., meeting all of the criteria for \nfully satisfactory performance under the UGIAP) and partly satisfactory (i.e., meeting only the \nminimum  requirements).  The  fully  satisfactory  Pourashavas  will  be  provided  with  a  bigger \nbudget (up to 40% of the total investment requirement assessed during the PPTA) for phase 2, \nwhile the partly satisfactory Pourashavas will be given a lower budget (up to 20% of the total \ninvestment required). Phase 2 will also be open to all Pourashavas under categories A and B \nthat are not included under phase 1 and are satisfactory to the Government and ADB. Where a \nnew Pourashava applies to participate in the Project, its application will be evaluated based on \nseparate entry criteria (Appendix 4). The eligible Pourashavas will sign a subproject agreement \nwith LGED to participate in phase 2, covering up to 20% of the total investment demand \nassessed by the PMO. The total number of Pourashavas covered under the second phase will \nnot exceed 30.    \n \n    c.  Phase 3 \n \n30.  Finally, the entry into phase 3 will depend on the performance during the second phase. \nOnly those Pourashavas, that maintain a fully satisfactory rating during phase 2 will proceed to \nthe final phase to fully utilize the financial assistance offered through the Project for urban \ninfrastructure improvements components. In this way, Pourashavas that were previously rated \nas partly satisfactory can enter phase 3 only after their performance has improved to the level of \nfully satisfactory. No new Pourashava will be admitted in phase 3. The eligible Pourashavas will \nenter into formal agreements with the Government to participate in phase 3.  \n \n31.  For the successful implementation of the performance-based approach, the application \nof  performance  criteria  must  be  done  in  a  transparent  and  balanced  manner.  The  final \nresponsibility to decide the ratings (unsatisfactory, partly satisfactory, or fully satisfactory) of the \nparticipating Pourashavas will be delegated to the Pourashava Performance Review Committee \n(PPRC) which will be established within the Local Government Division (LGD) of MLGRDC.8 \nWhile  PPRC  will  be  given  the  overall  responsibility  for  reviewing  the  performance  of  the \nPourashavas, technical and secretarial support will be provided by the Urban Management \nSupport Unit of LGED (para. 33). PPRC will consist of the secretary of LGD (as a chair), chief \nengineer of LGED, director general of LGD, representatives from the Planning Commission and \nthe Economics Relations Division (ERD) of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), a representative from \nthe  Implementation  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Division  (IMED)  of  the  Planning  Ministry,  a \nrenowned urban governance specialist nominated by LGD, an ADB representative, and the \ndirector of the national Urban Management Support Unit (UMSU) as the member secretary. \n \n  3.  Part C: Capacity Building and Implementation Assistance \n \n32.  The  capacity-building  and  implementation  assistance  component  comprises  (i) \nstrengthening  of  the  urban  management  wing  of  LGED,  and  (ii)  consulting  services  for \nsubproject design and supervision and institutional strengthening of the Pourashavas.  \n                                                 \n8 LGD has already established the Municipal Performance Review Committee (MPRC) to review and evaluate the \nperformance of all municipalities in Bangladesh under the World Bank's Municipal Services Project (MSP). The \nproposed PPRC will be project-based for providing timely evaluation of the performance of the Pourashavas under \nthe Project and will be absorbed under MPRC once the Project is completed. ", "8 \n \n    a.  Establishment of the Urban Management Support Unit \n \n33.  Recognizing  the  limitations  of  the  project-based  institutional  strengthening  approach \nadopted under STIDP I and II, the Project will support the 10 regional offices of LGED (including \nthe national office in Dhaka) to provide sustained capacity-building programs to all Pourashavas \nwithin their respective regional boundaries. Past experience indicates that the centrally located \nPourashava  Support  Unit  is  restricted  in  reaching  out  to  the  Pourashavas  and  providing \nsustained support. For this purpose, a new wing for urban management has been recently \nestablished in LGED to facilitate the development of targeted capacity-building programs for all \nurban local bodies and to coordinate regional training activities across the country.  In addition, \nto best utilize the available resources for capacity building, the existing Pourashava Support \nUnit (ADB-sponsored) will be merged with the Municipal Support Unit (World Bank-sponsored), \nand both will be absorbed under the single umbrella of UMSU. Given the limited resources, \nhowever,  only  the  larger  Pourashavas  (category  A  and  larger  category  B)9 will  be  initially \ncovered to receive training for their elected officials as well as their key staff.  \n \nb.  Institutional Strengthening of Pourashavas \n \n34.  Once  established,  UMSU  will  provide  comprehensive  training  opportunities  to  help \nPourashavas  mobilize  additional  financial  resources  and  improve  revenue  collection  and \nfinancial  management.  Specific  training  programs  to  be  provided  by  UMSU  include  (i)  an \norientation  program  for  Pourashava  chairpersons  and  ward  commissioners,  (ii)  a  tailored \nprogram for female ward commissioners, (iii) training programs for secretaries to implement the \ncommunity-based activities under the UGIAP, (iv) computerization of tax records and billing, (v) \ncomputerization  of  accounting  management,  (vi)  infrastructure  inventory  assessment  and \nmapping, and (vii) training for decentralized township planning. \n \n    c.  Implementation Assistance for Project Pourashavas \n \n35.  Project implementation assistance includes (i) project management and implementation \nsupport,  detailed  engineering  design,  procurement,  disbursement,  construction  supervision, \nbudgeting,  reporting,  and  overall  project  performance  monitoring;  (ii)  support  to  subproject \npreparation  and  appraisal;  and  (iii)  NGO  support  to  community-based  activities  for  urban \npoverty reduction.   \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n36.  In accordance with the sector loan approach, most of the investment will be decided on \nattainment  of  performance  criteria  by  the  Pourashavas  during  project  implementation.  The \nproject cost presented in Table 1 is based on the provisions made in the previous feasibility \nstudy in the Third Urban Development Project as well as the discussions held with Pourashavas \nduring the field visits. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $87.0 million equivalent, \nincluding about $5.9 million equivalent for duties and taxes. The foreign exchange cost is \nestimated at $21.5 million, or about 25% of the total project cost, including $1.7 million for \ninterest on the ADB loan during construction. The local currency cost is estimated at $65.5 \nmillion equivalent, or about 75% of the total project cost. Detailed project cost estimates are \nprovided in Appendix 6.  \n                                                 \n9  Based on the Government\u2019s classification.

Financing Plan \n \n37.  The Government has requested a loan in the amount of SDR 45,461,000 ($60 million \nequivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, which will represent about 69% of the total \nProject cost. The loan will cover the entire foreign exchange costs including the interest on the \nADB  loan  and  part  of  the  local  currency  costs,  excluding  taxes  and  duties.  A  domestic \ncontribution of $27 million equivalent is required which will include $22.8 million equivalent from \nthe Government, $3.9 million equivalent from the Pourashavas, and $0.3 million equivalent from \nthe project beneficiaries. The Borrower will be the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh. ADB\u2019s \nfinancing of local currency expenditure is justified by the nature of the Project, which will \nimprove the living and health conditions of the people in the project areas by improving existing \nunsanitary conditions, decongesting traffic and preventing damage to property and disruption of \nlives caused by flooding.

Arrangements at the Central Level \n \n39.  The Executing Agency of the Project will be LGED, under the overall supervision of LGD \nof MLGRDC. An interministerial steering committee chaired by the secretary of LGD will be \nestablished to oversee the Project, and will consist of senior-level representatives from LGD, \nLGED, the Planning Commission, ERD, the Finance Division of MOF, IMED, the National \nInstitute for Local Government, the Department of Public Health Engineering, the Ministry of \nWomen and Children Affairs, and representatives of the Pourashavas. The steering committee \nwill be established and will hold its first meeting within 3 months of the effectiveness date of the \nProject. The steering committee will meet at least once every 6 months to review the progress \nof the Project and guide the future direction. LGED will set up a project management office \n(PMO), led by a full-time project director (PD) at the level of a superintending engineer. The PD \nof the Project will be charged exclusively with its execution and will have no other duties within \nthe urban management wing of LGED. The PD, supported by the PMO, will coordinate all \nactivities  under  the  Project;  will  be  directly  responsible  for  overall  project  implementation, \nmonitoring, and supervision under the guidance of the director of the urban management wing \nof LGED (at the rank of additional chief engineer or superintending engineer); and will report to \nchief engineer. Overall implementation arrangements are in Appendix 7. \n \n40.  The  PMO  will  (i)  prepare  the  overall  Project  implementation  plan  and  consolidated \nannual  work  plan,  (ii)  assist  Pourashavas  in  implementing  the  UGIAP,  (iii)  assist  eligible \nPourashavas in preparing feasibility studies and subproject appraisal reports, (iv) monitor and \nsupervise all project management activities, (v) organize monitoring and evaluation activities, \n(vi) ensure the satisfactory implementation of the gender action plan and other activities under \nthe  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy;  and  (vii)  prepare  necessary  progress \nreports and the project completion report. The PD will be supported by two deputy project \ndirectors  (DPDs),  one  for  (i)  technical,  engineering,  and  supervision;  and  one  for  (ii) \nenvironment, sanitation, and slum improvement (ESSI). The PMO will be properly staffed and \nassisted  by  consultants  with  expertise  in  engineering,  finance  and  accounting,  social  and \ngender development, and urban management. In particular, the staffing requirements will reflect \nthe need to accommodate the tasks related to urban governance, and to social and gender \ndevelopment.10   \n \n    b.  Arrangements at the Pourashava Level \n \n41.  In each participating Pourashava, a project implementation unit (PIU) will be established \nas soon as the Pourashava enters into a subproject agreement with LGED. The PIU will be \nheaded  by  the  Pourashava  chairperson  and  will  comprise  three  sections:  (i)  infrastructure \nimprovement section; (ii) ESSI section; and (iii) urban governance improvement section. The \nchairperson will be assisted by the Pourashava chief executive officer for day-to-day operations \nof the subproject. The PIU will be located within the Pourashava office and will be responsible \nfor  (i)  preparation  of  an  annual  development  program  for  the  respective  Pourashava;  (ii) \npreparation of subproject component proposals;  (iii) tendering of works and services; (iv) \nimplementation of construction works; (v) implementation of the gender action plan (GAP), the \nUGIAP,  and  a  resettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nframework,  if  required;  and  (vi)  accounting  for  expenditures.  Training  of  PIU  staff  will  be \norganized at the beginning of the Project for civil works, slum improvement, sanitation, and \nregular administrative responsibilities.  \n \n                                                 \n10 Details of PMO and PIU staffing are provided in Supplementary Appendix E.

The  infrastructure  improvement  section,  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  all \nphysical infrastructure works, will be led by the head of the engineering department of the \nconcerned  Pourashava.  The  ESSI  section  will  undertake  all  environmental  and  slum \nimprovement activities and will be headed by the health officer of the Pourashava. Additional \ntechnical staff will be deputed from LGED to support the municipal engineer and the health \nofficer. The number of the LGED technical staff deputed to PIU (at the level of sub-assistant \nengineer and work assistant) will depend on the size of the Pourashava and the workload of the \nsubproject. In this way, a maximum transfer of skills and technology will be achieved and \ncapability further improved. For close supervision of all physical works including environmental \nactivities, the regional superintending engineer of LGED will be empowered to carry out regular \nsupervision, monitoring, and reporting on all project implementation activities to the PMO and \ndirector in charge of the urban management wing. For this purpose, the offices of the regional \nLGED  superintending  engineer  will  be  strengthened  by  two  additional  staff  (one  assistant \nengineer and one sub-assistant engineer). The quality of construction materials will be ensured \nwith the help of LGED\u2019s district laboratory (or other qualified institution).  \n \n43.  The urban governance improvement section, headed by the secretary of the Pourashava, \nwill be responsible for the implementation of the UGIAP.  For successful implementation, it is \nimportant to have an accurate assessment of the training requirements at the beginning of the \nProject and to provide Pourashava officials, staff, and other stakeholders with the timely training \nopportunities at the municipal, regional, and national levels. A group of facilitators (as individual \nconsultants) will be engaged to provide the necessary technical support and hands-on training \nat the local level. In addition, the PMO will make necessary provisions to meet the budget \nrequirements of the Pourashavas in supporting the activities under the UGIAP. \n \n44.  Each PIU will have an accounting section, directly under the Pourashava chairperson, to \ndeal with the procedural aspects and the recording of the financial transactions and preparation \nof liquidation statements and replenishment requests to the PMO. To assist the accounting \nsection to meet additional workload, one accounting assistant will be deputed from LGED. \n \n    c.  Establishment of National and Regional UMSUs \n \n45.  The national UMSU in Dhaka will be headed by a full-time director at the level of \nadditional chief engineer or superintending engineer, assisted by three deputy directors, one \neach for (i) governance program development (GPD), (ii) general administration and training \ncoordination, and (iii) database development and performance evaluation and monitoring (PEM). \nThe GPD section will be responsible for developing tailor-made capacity-building programs \nrelated to the implementation of the UGIAP. The GPD will also develop orientation programs on \nthe objectives, approach, and entry requirements of the Project and arrange training of trainers. \nThe general administration and training coordination section will be responsible for general \nadministration (including the budget and staffing requirements of the UMSU) and will also \nassume responsibility for coordinating training programs and modules to be conducted by the \n10 regional UMSUs. The regional UMSUs will be established at the offices of the regional \nsuperintending  engineer.  Incremental  staff  and  operational  budget  will  be  provided  to  the \nregional offices of LGED to organize and conduct training for the Pourashavas within their \nrespective  jurisdictions.    Finally,  the  PEM  section  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  and \nevaluation of the performance of the Pourashavas in achieving the targets in the UGIAP. In this \nconnection, the PEM will also serve as the secretariat for the PPRC. Further, the PEM will \nprepare  an  annual  ranking  of  the  performance  of  all  Pourashavas  in  Bangladesh  and \ndisseminate the results to the general public through national media, its own publications, and a \nweb  site.  For  this  purpose,  the  PEM  will  set  up  and  maintain  a  database  for  municipal \nperformance and design a scoring system for performance measurement. ", "12 \n \n2.  Subproject Appraisal  \n \na.  Phase-1 Pourashavas \n \n46.  The participating Pourashavas will be responsible for the preparation of a vision paper \noutlining their needs and the development assistance required. In principle, these needs should \nbe based on a strategic development vision, including a draft land use plan (prepared in a \nparticipatory manner). Although all 22 towns under phase 1 have already identified high priority \ninvestment components, the requirement for the preparation of aforesaid overall vision remains, \nsince it provides the wider context of the envisaged developments. This activity should be \nundertaken as early as possible in time for the preparation of the subproject appraisal report \n(SPAR).  \n \n47.  After completing the vision paper, each Pourashava, with the assistance of the PMO and \nthe design consultants, will then prepare the SPAR for ADB's review and approval.  A SPAR will \nbe prepared for each phase describing (i) the visions for municipal development and a declared \ncommitment  to  carry  out  the  UGIAP;  (ii)  the  subproject  need,  rationale,  scope,  target \nbeneficiaries  and  benefits,  potential  constraints,  and  mitigation  measures;  (iii)  subproject \ncomponent  locations,  design  standards,  analysis  of  least-cost  options,  cost  estimates, \nimplementation arrangements and schedule, and procurement arrangements; (iv) environmental \nand  social  assessment  (including  a  resettlement  plan  and/or  indigenous  peoples  plan,  if \nrequired under the applicable laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s policies and guidelines); (v) \nfinancial and economic justification of the subproject and its components; (vi) financing plan, \ntogether with financial sustainability analysis; and (vii) an implementation plan for the UGIAP \nshowing how the Pourashava will achieve the performance targets under the Program. The \nselection of the subproject components will be based on the criteria specified in Appendix 8. \n \n48.  Following ADB\u2019s approval, each Pourashava and the PMO will prepare a subproject \nagreement to be signed by the Pourashava chairperson and the chief engineer of LGED. A \nsubsidiary loan agreement will also be signed by the Pourashava chairperson and MOF, if the \nsubproject involves relending of loan proceeds from the Government to the Pourashava. No \nfunds will be provided to a Pourashava under any phase until the subproject agreement and \nsubsidiary loan agreement (if required), both satisfactory to ADB, have been executed. These \ndocuments will describe any conditions and covenants that must be satisfied by the Pourashava \nbefore and during subproject implementation, including the loan repayment schedule. Subject to \nADB  approval  of  these  two  documents,  implementation  will  proceed  under  the  PMO/PIU \nframework.  \n \n    b.  New Pourashavas \n \n49.  Where a new Pourashava applies for participation in phase 2, a team from the UMSU\u2019s \nPEM section will visit it to assess the situation and provide guidance on the selection procedure. \nFollowing the visit, the Pourashava will prepare a vision paper, which will provide detailed \ninformation on the development assistance required and its qualification to meet the entry \ncriteria. The request will be submitted to the PPRC through the PEM section of UMSU for its \nreview  and  decision.  After  approval  by  the  PPRC,  the  PMO  will  then  proceed  with  the \npreparation of the SPAR for phase 2 of the Project. With the approval of the SPAR by ADB (as \ndescribed in para. 47), the Pourashava will follow the same procedure as described in para. 48 \nfor further processing of the subproject. \n   \n3.  Implementation Period and Start-Up Activities \n \n50.  Based on the experience of STIDP I and II, and in view of the of the sector modality of \nthe current Project and the large number and geographical spread of participating Pourashavas, \nthe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  6  years.  Implementation  is  expected  to ", "13 \ncommence in the third quarter of 2003. Start-up activities will include the establishment of the \nnational and regional UMSUs, recruitment of project staff and consultants, preparation of the \nSPARs for the phase 1 work program, and procurement of immediately required equipment. \nPhysical works may not start before the fourth quarter of 2003 due to the need to undertake \nextensive surveys, prepare the SPARS for approval, and prepare detailed engineering designs \nand contract documents. Since the Project is divided into three phases, the implementation \nschedule is also built around these three phases (Appendix 9).  \n \n4.  Procurement \n \n51.  Procurement will generally be carried out by the PIUs under the guidance of the PMO \nwith the assistance of the LGED district level staff as necessary. All procurement of goods and \nservices financed by ADB will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Since \nthe contracts for civil works will be small and widely dispersed, international competitive bidding \nis not considered appropriate. Consequently, all the civil works contracts will be procured on the \nbasis  of  local  competitive  bidding  among  prequalified  contractors  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s procurement procedures acceptable to ADB. Pre-qualification, selection, and \nengagement of contractors under local competitive bidding will be subject to the approval of \nADB. To ensure economy and efficiency in contract administration, small contracts for roads \nand drainage improvement works at various construction sites will be grouped together to obtain \na higher contract value. There will be one contract each for bus terminals, markets, and major \nroad or drainage improvement works. Efforts will be made to limit the number of contracts and \nengage larger professional contractors. This approach will minimize the construction period and \nensure single accountability for the quality of work. Civil works contracts below the statement of \nexpenditures (SOE) limit of $50,000 will be permitted on a case-by-case basis. NGOs may be \nengaged for the purpose of coordination between the PIU and beneficiaries. Based on the \nlessons from STIDP II, NGOs will not be engaged in civil works, and hardware delivery and they \nwill focus mainly on community participation and provision of microcredit.  \n \n52.  Each supply contract for equipment or materials estimated to cost the equivalent of more \nthan $500,000 will be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding, and those \ncosting the equivalent of $500,000 or less (other than minor items) but more than $100,000 will \nbe awarded on the basis of international shopping. Indicative procurement packages indicate \nthat individual contract packages under the Project will be less than $500,000 in value, in which \ncase international shopping procedures will be followed. Direct purchase procedures will be \nused for small or off-the-shelf items valued at less than $100,000. Procurement of equipment \nwill be done by the PMO. Indicative procurement packages are included in Appendix 10. \n \n5.  Consulting Services  \n \n53.  Consulting services are required to facilitate project implementation and to strengthen \nthe institutional, administrative, and financial capacities of the Pourashavas. Consultants will be \nselected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  selection  and  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants.11 In total, five packages of consulting services will be provided under the Project: \ntwo for the UMSU and three for the PMO. For implementation of the UGIAP, a firm will be \nengaged to the GPD section of the UMSU for developing and testing the training programs and \nfor training LGED staff and others on the delivery of the training programs. To assist the PEM \nsection of the UMSU, individual consultants will be recruited to carry out project-specific as well \nas broad-based monitoring and evaluation of the performance of the Pourashavas. In particular, \nthe consultants will closely monitor the progress in achieving the targets in the UGIAP and \nreport to the PPRC for its consideration and decision. The PEM consultants will also develop a \n                                                 \n11 Effective 1 April 2002, the selection of consultants will include the use of the quality-and-cost-based selection \nmethod, which involves the simultaneous submission of technical and financial proposals and the use of price as \nan evaluation criteria. ", "14 \nnationwide  database  for  continuous  monitoring  and  comparison  of  the  performance  of  all \nPourashavas in the country.  \n \n54.  For engineering management, design and construction supervision, a consulting firm will \nbe engaged to assist the PMO and PIUs in preparing surveys, detailed engineering designs, \ncontract  documentation,  tender,  and  supervision  works.  For  monitoring  and  evaluation, \nindividual consultants will be engaged, while the facilitators (as individual consultants) will be \nassigned to assist the Pourashavas in forming citizens committees, preparing and implementing \nUGIAP, mobilizing community participation, and so forth. Further, NGOs will be engaged to \nfacilitate community mobilization for improving living conditions of slum dwellers, provision of \nmicrocredit  for  income-generating  activities,  and  social  programs  (e.g.,  on  literacy  training, \npoverty reduction). These NGOs will be selected following criteria as developed under the \nProject.12  Details for the required consultancy services are provided in Appendix 11. \n \n6.  Financing Low-Cost Sanitation and Microcredit Activities \n \n55.  For the low-cost sanitation component, beneficiaries will take out loans from a revolving \nfund to be set up by the Pourashavas in a manner satisfactory to ADB; this will be repaid twice a \nmonth over a 10-month period at an annual interest rate of 10%. For the slum dwellers, the slum \ndevelopment committee organized under the Project will receive a grant for 50% of the cost of \nthe  household  toilets  in  the  community,  with  the  remaining  50%  to  be  mobilized  by  the \nbeneficiaries.  Experienced NGOs will be engaged to mobilize the community and administer \nthe revolving fund. Part B of the Project includes the provision of a grant fund for microcredit to \nthe Pourashavas. Selected NGOs will be engaged to operate the microcredit activities aimed to \nsupport the income-generating activities of poor and low-income women entrepreneurs in the \nparticipating  Pourashavas.    On  an  experimental  basis,  microcredit  operations  may  include \nsupport to urban youth, which will be reviewed during the midterm review. Based on the detailed \nbusiness proposals, an individual can receive a loan within a range from Tk2,500 to Tk15,000 \nand a group of four members up to Tk60,000 depending on the type of the business.  An annual \ninterest rate of 15% will be charged to the borrower by the implementing NGO. The loan \ntogether with the interest, will be repaid over a period of 1 year in equal installments (twice a \nmonth). Collection will start 1 month after disbursement. Of the 15% collected as interest, one \nthird will be retained with the implementing NGO for operation of the fund, and the remaining \ntwo  thirds  will  be  added  to  the  revolving  fund.  The  PMO  will  develop  guidelines  for  the \nmanagement and operation of the microcredit component under the Project.  \n \n7.  Land Acquisition, Resettlement, and Indigenous Peoples \n \n56.  Land acquisition problems have frequently been a major source of delays in previous \nurban  projects  in  Bangladesh.  Consequently,  under  the  Project,  the  land  acquisition \nrequirements have been minimized. The process of site selection will also be improved through \nthe use of site selection guidelines developed under STIDP II. In addition, committees will be \nformed at the Pourashava level immediately upon entry into the Project to undertake rapid \nselection and evaluation of potential land sites. To minimize implementation delays due to land \nacquisition,  each  Pourashava  will  be  required  to  complete  the  preparatory  work  for  land \nacquisition prior to its submission of a SPAR. Actual land acquisition must be completed within \n180 days from the signing of the subproject agreement; otherwise, the component will be \nremoved from the SPAR.  Should any involuntary resettlement be required for a subproject \ncomponent or loss of assets/income be expected during project implementation, the SPAR will \ninclude a resettlement plan, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and \nthe Project\u2019s land acquisition and resettlement framework.13 The Project design also includes an \nindigenous peoples framework14 to ensure that project benefits are equally shared between \n                                                 \n12 The selection criteria for NGO engagement are provided in Supplementary Appendix F. \n13  The Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework is included in Supplementary Appendix G and the Sample \nResettlement Plan in Supplementary Appendix H.   \n14  The Indigenous Peoples Framework is provided in Supplementary Appendix I. ", "15 \nindigenous people and the Bengali settlers in Bandarban and Khagrachari in the Chitagong Hill \nTracts.    \n \n  8.  Operation and Maintenance \n \n57.  The  Pourashavas  will  be  responsible  for  operating  and  maintaining  the  subproject \ninvestments. The operation and maintenance (O&M) manuals prepared under STIDP II will be \nrevised for use by the PIUs. These manuals will describe the O&M procedures for municipal \ninfrastructure,  services,  and  facilities  and  will  be  designed  for  regular  use  by  Pourashava \nengineering staff. The PMO consultants will provide specific training to all relevant staff of the \nPourashava in O&M of infrastructure facilities. One of the tasks of the institutional strengthening \nconsultants on O&M will be to define for each Pourashava the O&M requirements and obtain a \nrealistic assessment of the costs involved. These consultants will use the manuals and on-the-\njob  training  to  ensure  that  the  staff  in  the  Pourashava  are  made  familiar  with  the  O&M \nresponsibilities and requirements. The incremental O&M costs during the implementation period \nare not included in the Project cost, but the UGIAP requires the participating Pourashavas to set \naside at least 15% equivalent of the annual development budget to cover O&M expenditures \neach year.   \n \n9.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n \n58.  The civil works contracts to be awarded will generally be small in value and involve a \nlarge  number  of  contractors.  To  ensure  effective  Project  implementation  and  timely \ndisbursement, the Government will establish an imprest account in the name of the Project at \nthe Bangladesh Bank immediately after the effectiveness of the Loan Agreement. Payments for \ncivil works contracts will be made through this account for eligible payments under the Project. \nSimilarly, payments for incremental administrative costs of the UMSU, PMO, and PIUs will also \nbe  made  through  the  imprest  account.  The  SOE  procedure  will  be  adopted  to  facilitate \nreimbursement and liquidation of small contracts. The imprest account and the SOE procedure \nwill be established, maintained, and audited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook of January 2001. The initial advance to the imprest account will correspond to 6 \nmonths  of  estimated  ADB-financed  expenditures  to  be  paid  from  this  account.  The  SOE \nprocedure is applicable only to individual payments below $50,000 equivalent. \n \n10.  Accounts, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n59.  The  Government  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation. Reports will be prepared by each PIU and consolidated by the PMO. The PMO \nwill particularly address progress in meeting the targets under the UGIAP. The progress reports \nwill also include other information on the physical progress of works and the status of training \nand support program by the UMSUs. LGED/PMO will also submit to ADB, within 3 months of \nphysical completion of the Project, a project completion report that will cover the details of \nproject  implementation,  cost,  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities,  and  other  information \nrequested by ADB. \n \n60.  LGED/PMO and the PIUs will maintain accounts and records in such a manner as to \nfacilitate identification of income and expenditures related to the Project. They will be assisted \nby an adequate number of suitably qualified accounting staff, including a financial manager in \nthe  PMO.  Additionally,  the  PMO  and  PIUs  will  be  assisted  by  a  financial  consultant  in \nestablishing the Project accounting and recording systems, and in training the staff to maintain \nthe  systems.  Auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  will  audit  all  the  accounts  and  statements  of \nexpenditures and revenues related to the Project annually. Audited financial statements and \nproject accounts, together with the report of the auditor, will be submitted within 9 months of the \nclose of the financial year. The annual audit will include the audit of the imprest account and \nSOE procedure, and a separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account and SOE \nprocedure should be included in the annual audit report. LGED and the Pourashavas have been ", "16 \nmade aware of ADB\u2019s policy on delayed submission, and the requirement for satisfactory and \nacceptable quality of the audited accounts. \n \n11.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n61.  To  ensure  that  project  activities  and  facilities  are  managed  efficiently  and  that  the \nbenefits reach the target groups, a monitoring and evaluation program is included within the \nframework of ADB\u2019s Project Performance Management System (PPMS). PPMS activities will be \nconducted periodically to gather information from multiple sources to determine whether the \ninput  deliveries  for  implementing  project  activities  have  rendered  expected  benefits  to  the \nintended beneficiaries. The PPMS also seeks to detect any deficiency and discrepancy between \nthe plan and the execution of the project in using the resources efficiently so that timely \ncorrections can be made to update the project and thus improve the benefits, outcomes, and \nimpact.  The  indicators  to  be  monitored  have  been  formulated  and  agreed  upon  with  the \nExecuting  Agency,  including  indicators  pertaining  to  both  physical  progress  and  capacity-\nbuilding activities.15 The PMO will conduct initial baseline physical and socioeconomic surveys \nand  submit  a  detailed  implementation  plan  for  monitoring  performance  and  for  preparing \nbenchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence within 6 months of loan effectiveness. \nThereafter, the PMO will submit annual monitoring and evaluation reports to ADB throughout \nthe project implementation. \n \n12.  Project Review \n \n62.  Because of the large number of Pourashavas and components to be covered under the \nProject,  the  regular  reviews  to  be  conducted  by  ADB  at  least  two  times  a  year  will  be \nsupplemented by a formal midterm review, to be carried out jointly by the Government and ADB. \nThe routine project reviews will include a review of the Pourashavas\u2019 financial performance and \nstaffing,  the  implementation  of  the  UGIAP  and  the  GAP,  physical  progress  on  project \nimplementation, and capacity-building activities. The midterm review will allow the Government \nand ADB to monitor the Project closely and to make appropriate adjustments in the Project \ndesign and implementation arrangements, if necessary. The midterm review will be conducted \nat the end of phase 1 or in the middle of the project implementation period. \n \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR SUPPORTING URBAN GOVERNANCE REFORM \n \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n \n63.  The accompanying TA will provide necessary technical and secretarial support to the \nCommittee on Urban Local Governments (CULG), which will be established with the assistance \nfrom the TA and will cover the following key policy areas which were identified during the policy \ndialogue with the Government: (i) in consultation with various stakeholders in the urban sector, \nto prepare the National Urban Sector Policy for cabinet approval, containing recommendations, \namong others, on the approach to be followed in the process and pattern of urbanization in \nBangladesh; (ii) to review the existing holding tax system in the country and suggest reforms for \nimproving the collection of holding taxes from public and private sector entities as well as \nsolving the problem of recurrent arrears of such taxes; (iii) to make recommendations for the \namendment  of  the  1977  Pourashava  Ordinance  to  reflect  the  needs  for  improved  local \ngovernance and better urban management; and (iv) to review the Government\u2019s long-term \nstrategy  for  municipal  development  (covering  upazila  towns  and  Pourashavas)  and  make \nrecommendations  for  preparing  a  master  plan  for  future  development  of  these  key  urban \ncenters. Appendix 12 provides the terms of reference for CULG under the TA. \n \n                                                 \n15 Details of these indicators are provided in Supplementary Appendix J. ", "17 \nB.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n64.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $520,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested  ADB  to  finance  $400,000  equivalent,  covering  all  the  foreign  exchange  costs \n($85,000) and part of the local costs. ADB will finance $400,000 equivalent, on a grant basis, \nfrom ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The proposed Government in-kind contribution of $120,000 \nequivalent will cover office costs, conference venues, and counterpart staff remuneration.  \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n65.  LGD will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and a joint secretary of LGD will head the \nsecretariat to assist CULG; other members of the secretariat will be provided by LGD and LGED \nand the secretariat will be established at LGED. The secretariat will also be assisted by a group \nof individual consultants with expertise in urban policy, planning, law, and local government \nfinance. The TA is expected to commence as soon as the Project is approved by ADB\u2019s Board \nand to be completed in 2 years. \n \n66.  CULG will convene meetings at least six times during its 2-year tenure. The chairperson \nmay call additional meetings as necessary. CULG, with assistance of the secretariat, will hold \ndiscussions (at the national, regional, and local levels) with political leaders, policy makers, and \nlocal  stakeholders  as  well  as  the  local  aid  community  in  the  urban  sector;  review  the \nrecommendations  of  similar  commissions/committees;  review  relevant  documents,  acts, \nordinances; and carry out studies on key issues of urban local governance.  \n \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Major Benefits and Impacts \n \n1.  Gender and Social \n \n67.  The gender and social assessments under the Project (the Summary Poverty Reduction \nand Social Strategy is found in Appendix 13) have resulted in the preparation of (i) the GAP to \naddress the need for active participation of women in urban planning and management as both \nbeneficiaries  and  agents,  (ii)  the  resettlement  framework  for  the  population  that  may  be \ndisplaced or suffer loss of assets and/or income as a result of project implementation, and (iii) \nthe indigenous peoples framework to ensure their full participation in the Project and to address \npotential risks to them. These frameworks provide guidelines to assess the gender and social \nimpact of all subprojects, and any subproject not meeting these standards will not be eligible for \nfinancing.  \n \n  2.  Economic and Financial \n \n68.  The  Project  will  generally  benefit  the  whole  of  the  urban  community,  and  some \ncomponents will focus on upgrading the conditions of the poorest and most needy groups in the \nslum areas. The investments will result in substantial direct and indirect benefits, including \nimproved urban environment, better health, and higher employment and income generation \npotential for the residents. Components for the first phase (roads and drainage rehabilitation) \nwere evaluated by cost-benefit analysis as summarized in Appendix 14. Subprojects for which \neconomic analysis was carried out yielded an average rate of return of 34.0% for the drainage \ncomponent and 30.6% for the road component. Overall, phase 1 investments are economically \nviable, and sensitivity analyses show that the returns are robust. Financial analysis was carried \nout  for  the  only  revenue-generating  component,  namely,  the  water  supply  scheme  in \nLakshmipur. The rate of return was estimated at 10.7%, which is above the weighted average \ncost of capital, estimated at 7.0%. For the second and third phase investments, the economic \nand financial analyses will be reported in the SPARs for review by ADB. In general, however, it ", "18 \nis expected that most municipal subprojects to be financed under the Project will have high \neconomic rates of return due to the severe deficiencies in most Pourashavas.  \n \n  3.  Fiscal  \n \n69.  The financial burden of the Project on local government finances will not be significant. \nAs most funding will be made available as grants to the Pourashavas, the debt service impact \non local governments will be small. On the other hand, implementation of the Project will create \nemployment opportunities, increase urban productivity, improve the management of municipal \nfinances, mobilize more revenue, and rationalize municipal spending.  The net fiscal impact of \nthese improvements is expected to substantially outweigh project investments.  \n \n  4.  Environmental  \n \n70.  The Project has been assigned environmental assessment category B. Overall, it is \nanticipated to have positive environmental impacts in reducing incidences of various diseases, \nimproving environmental conditions in urban areas, and reducing flooding. The negative impacts \nwill mostly relate to construction activities, which will be temporary, during construction only. \nOther potential negative impacts, such as groundwater contamination from sanitary landfills and \ndisposal of sludge from latrines, can be addressed by applying proper environmental and \nsanitary engineering technologies during the design, construction, and operation stages. For \nevaluation purposes, sample initial environmental examinations (IEEs) have been conducted for \nsubprojects with the highest potential environmental impacts in accordance with environmental \nrequirements and ADB's guidelines for infrastructure projects.16 \n \n71.  For subprojects that are still to be confirmed, the IEE will be prepared in accordance with \nADB's  guidelines  for  infrastructure  projects.  For  construction,  compliance  with  government \nenvironmental requirements as certified by the relevant government authorities will be sufficient \nfor typical subproject components costing less than $1 million.17 For subproject components \ncosting between $1 million and $3 million, ADB will review and approve the IEEs on a \"no \nobjection\" basis. For subproject components costing more than $3 million, ADB will review IEEs \nprior to the start of construction. \n   \n5.  Technical  \n \n72.  The majority of works under the Project are relatively small. These schemes were \nidentified  based  on  the  needs  and  priorities  of  the  Pourashavas  in  consultation  with  the \ncommunities.  The  works  under  the  Project  do  not  require  complex  design  or  construction \ntechniques, and are within the technical capabilities of the Pourashavas. LGED will provide \nadditional technical support as considered necessary and will supervise the quality of the works \nof the Pourashavas. Engineering designs for the phase 1 works have been reviewed by the \nPPTA consultants. Design and supervision consultants will further review the designs to assure \ntechnical quality and timeliness.  \n \nB.  Major Risks \n \n73.  The overall framework of the Project (Appendix 1) summarizes its objectives, indicators \nto be used to measure achievements, and assumptions that must be satisfied to avoid the risk \nof noncompliance. While no unusual risks are foreseen during implementation, the potential \nrisks concern (i) delays in implementation due to slow progress with start-up activities; (ii) lack of \nsuitably  qualified  personnel  in  the  Pourashavas,  which  may  eventually  lead  to  weak \n                                                 \n16  The summary IEE is provided in Supplementary Appendix K. \n17  ADB provided a TA to the Government to review and evaluate environmental impact assessments: ADB. 1991. \nTechnical Assistance to Bangladesh for Environmental Management Training. Manila. ", "19 \nimplementation of subprojects at the Pourashava level; and (iii) sustainability of the facilities and \nservices provided under the Project.  \n \n74.  Implementation  delay  can  be  prevented  to  a  large  extent  by  timely  mobilization  of \nconsultants. Advance action is required to ensure that the implementation schedule can be \nadhered to. Second, the Government will ensure that qualified staff nominated for the UMSU \nand PMO will be available at the commencement of the Project. The activities under the UGIAP \ncannot be undertaken if the key positions are left unfilled. Finally, the sustainability of Project will \ndepend on the ability of the Pourashavas to generate sufficient revenues from their own sources. \nWith the training and added incentives under the Project for better financial performance, the \nrisk to sustainability of the investments in infrastructure can be minimized. \n \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n75.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government will cause each Pourashava, with assistance from the PMO and \nthe consultants, to submit its SPAR in a timely manner prior to each phase, for \napproval by ADB. The SPAR for each phase will describe the technical, financial, \nand economic viability of the subproject and its components as well as social and \nenvironmental issues and sustainability. The SPARs will include summary IEEs \nand resettlement plans, if required under applicable laws and regulations and \nADB\u2019s environmental guidelines and Policy on Involuntary Resettlement.  \n \n(ii)  The  Government  will  cause  each  participating  Pourashava  to  enter  into  a \nsubproject agreement with LGED satisfactory to ADB, following the approval of \nthe SPAR for each phase by ADB. The subproject agreement will describe any \nconditions and covenants that must be satisfied by the Pourashava before and \nduring  subproject  implementation,  including  actions  under  the  UGIAP.  If  the \nsubproject  involves  relending  of  loan  proceeds  from  the  Government  to  the \nPourashava, a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to ADB will also be signed \nby  the  Pourashava  chairperson  and  MOF.  Subject  to  ADB  approval, \nimplementation will proceed under the framework developed by the PMO/PIU.  \n \n(iii)  The  Government  will  cause  the  interministerial  steering  committee  to  be \nestablished and the first meeting be held within 3 months of loan effectiveness. \n \n(iv)  The Government will cause LGED to adopt and fully carry out the GAP during the \nproject implementation period. To this end, the Government will require the PMO \nto prepare field manuals for the GAP and conduct training for the PMO and PIU \nstaff. The implementation of the GAP will be closely monitored and the progress \nwill be reported in the quarterly reports to the ADB.   \n \n(v)  The Government will require each Pourashava to complete the preparatory work \nfor land acquisition prior to its submission of a SPAR for each phase. Actual land \nacquisition must be completed within 180 days from the signing of the subproject \nagreement for each phase; otherwise, the component will be removed from the \nSPAR. If any involuntary resettlement of residents is required for land acquisition, \na resettlement plan will be prepared in accordance with applicable laws and \nregulations, ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, and the Project\u2019s land \nacquisition and resettlement framework. \n ", "20 \n(vi)  The  Government  will  cause  LGED  to  conduct  initial  baseline  physical  and \nsocioeconomic surveys and submit a detailed implementation plan for monitoring \nperformance and for preparing benchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and \nconcurrence within 6 months of loan effectiveness. \n \n(vii)  The Government will cause MLGRDC to establish CULG to guide its long-term \nstrategy for municipal development, including preparing the draft National Urban \nSector Policy, recommending reforms for the collection of holding taxes, and \nrecommending amendments to the 1977 Pourashava Ordinance to reflect the \nneed for improved and better urban management.  The Government will cause \nCULG to complete its responsibilities as described in its terms of reference within \n2 years from the approval by ADB of the associated TA for Supporting Urban \nGovernance Reform. MLGRDC will ensure that the recommendations of CULG \nare submitted for cabinet approval.  \n \n(viii)  The  Government  will  cause  MLGRDC  to  set  up  PPRC  within  LGD  by  31 \nDecember 2003. PPRC will require technical and secretarial support from the \nUMSU, through its PEM, including the collection of relevant information and the \npreparation of the draft performance evaluation report. PPRC will consist of the \nsecretary of LGD (as chairperson), chief engineer of LGED, director general of \nLGD,  representatives  from  the  Planning  Commission  and  ERD  of  MOF,  a \nrepresentative from IMED, a renowned urban governance specialist nominated \nby  LGD,  an  ADB  representative  and  the  director  of  the  UMSU  as  member \nsecretary.  \n \n(ix)  The Government will require the Pourashavas in the Chittagong Hill Tracts to \nimplement the indigenous peoples framework prepared under the Project.   \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n76.  The following will be special conditions for loan effectiveness: \n \n(i)  The project proforma (for the Loan and the accompanying TA) will have been \napproved by the Government.  \n(ii)  A 5-year work plan for the UMSU acceptable to ADB will have been submitted to \nADB.  \n \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n77.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions of Articles 35.1 of the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  45,461,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nBangladesh for the Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement (Sector) Project from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.  \n \nMyoung-Ho Shin \nVice-President \n \n31 October 2002 ", "Appendix 1  21 \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nNarrative  Indicators and  Monitoring  Key \nSummary  Targets  Mechanisms  Assumptions \n1.

", "26  Appendix 2   \nSUMMARY OF URBAN SECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Demographic and Spatial Trends \n \n1.  Bangladesh has experienced significant growth in urban population from less than 5 \nmillion in 1971 to almost 30 million in 2001. Accordingly, the level of urbanization increased from \nbelow 8% in 1971 to 23% in 2001. The growth in the number of urban centers has also been \nphenomenal, from under 100 in 1971 to 522 in 1991 (and most likely to be more than 550 in \n2001). There has also been growth in the number of large urban centers: Cities with more than \n100,000 population have grown in number from 5 in 1971 to 25 in 2001. There were no \u201cmillion \ncities\u201d in Bangladesh in 1961; now there are three, with Dhaka emerging as a megacity with \nnearly 10 million people in its greater Statistical Metropolitan Area.  \n \n2.  Although Bangladesh presents a unique case of dispersal of urban centers almost in \nuniform density throughout the country (with the exception of the Chittagong Hill Tracts), the \ndistribution is far from being a balanced one by city size. Certain regions suffer from the \nabsence of large metropolitan centers, which could play the role of regional magnets or growth \npoles, and somewhat reduce the strong pull effect of Dhaka. Another spatial pattern in urban \ndevelopment in Bangladesh is the recent emergence of a corridor form of urban expansion, \nradiating from Dhaka towards the west, north, northeast, and east, following the highways, and \nto the southeast along the water routes. Railways have played a complementary role to roads in \nthe northern and northeastern corridors. \n \nB.  Institutional Framework \n \n3.  In terms of administrative structure, urban centers in Bangladesh are classified as city \ncorporations, Pourashavas (municipalities), and \u201cother urban areas\u201d (which are run under the \nunion parishad system). The present number of city corporations is 4 (Dhaka, Chittagong, \nKhulna, and Rajshahi), with two more Pourashavas to be upgraded to city corporations (Sylhet \nand Barisal), while the number of Pourashavas is now over 250 (growing from less than 120 in \n1996).  Municipal  governments  include  city  corporations  and  pourashavas.  All  municipal \ngovernments operate within the limits set by relevant ordinances and acts. For instance, the \nPourashava Ordinance of 1977 lays down the foundation of pourashavas and their functions, \nwhile similar ordinances define the role, power, and responsibilities of the city corporations. \nBesides the city corporations and pourashavas, some special development authorities and \nspecial purpose authorities were created to meet the growing demand for services based on two \nother ordinances \u2212 the Town Improvement Act of 1953 and the Sewerage Authority Ordinance \nof 1963. \n \n4.  Corporations  and  Pourashavas  have  an  elected  head  (mayor  for  corporations  and \nchairperson for Pourashavas) and a council of commissioners who represent the people in each \nsuburb  or  ward,  and  are  mandated  by  ordinance  to  provide  urban  services  including  (i) \nmaintenance of roads, drainage, and parks; (ii) operation of water supply systems, community \ntoilets, markets, solid waste management, and slaughterhouses; (iii) delivery of public health \nand basic services for the urban poor; and (iv) development and building control. The executive \npower of a municipality rests with its chairperson or mayor who is the primary decision-maker. \nThe chief executive officer is appointed by the Government but has only such executive powers \nas  the  chairperson  may  authorize.  All  officers  and  employees  of  the  Pourashava  are \nsubordinate  to  chief  executive  officer.    Municipal  ordinances,  however,  contain  numerous \nclauses under which the Central Government can give directions to municipalities. In fact, only a \nfew amendments have been made to the Pourashava Ordinance in the last 10 years, and even ", "Appendix 2  27 \nthese were all minor changes not sufficient to accord clear authority and decision-making power \nto local governments.  \n \nC.  Urban Sector Policy Framework \n \n5.  Although the Government of Bangladesh has long been aware of both the rapid pace of \nurbanization in the country and the associated physical, economic, and social problems, it has \nnot yet adopted an explicit urban policy. However, a number of government documents and \nother initiatives have from time to time indicated the policy thinking of the Government with \nregard to urbanization and urban development. The National Report on Human Settlements \nsubmitted to the United Nations Habitat I Conference held at Vancouver in Canada in 1976 \ncame  close  to  a  policy  statement  on  human  settlements  and  urbanization  in  Bangladesh. \nBesides this, the various five-year plan documents prepared between 1973 and 1998 also \nindicated some policy direction.  \n \n6.  Overall, however, the formal planning documents have sidetracked urban development.. \nFor instance, almost none of the plans developed through successive five-year plan exercises \nwere ever implemented. In 1991, the Planning Commission abandoned the sequence of five-\nyear plans and instead spent a lot of time to issue a 15-year Participatory Perspective Plan to \nbe supplemented with detailed Annual Development Programs. However, the Plan was never \nfinalized, and the five-year planning process was reestablished. The Fifth Five-Year Plan has \nfollowed  more  or  less  the  earlier  policies  and  emphasized  decentralization  development. \nHowever, investments have continued to be concentrated in the largest cities, Dhaka and \nChittagong. On the other hand, a number of parallel developments outside the five-year plan \nexercises have emphasized urbanization and the urban sector. The Report of the Task Force on \nSocial Implications of Urbanization prepared in 1991 at the behest of the interim government of \nthe time made an elaborate statement on urban policy and poverty reduction. This report, \nhowever,  was  not  approved  by  the  new  Government  and  therefore  not  considered  for \nimplementation.  \n7.  Subsequently, the National Housing Policy (1993), the Bangladesh Urban and Shelter \nSector Review (1993), the Bangladesh Urban Sector National Program Document (1994), the \nBangladesh National Habitat II Report (1996), and the recent Bangladesh National Habitat II \nIstanbul+5 Report (2001) have all underscored the most important role urbanization can play in \nnational development. All these documents have spelled out policy directions and even action \nplans  for  achieving  a  balanced  development  process.  The  National  Housing  Policy  is  an \nofficially approved document, and so are the 1996 Habitat II and 2001 Istanbul+5 Report. The \nUrban Management Policy Statements (1994 and 1999) prepared by the Ministry of Local \nGovernment (jointly with the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank) emphasized that all \nPourashavas should have adequate personnel and financial strength, provide and maintain \nbasic infrastructure facilities, prepare and implement land use plans, address poverty, ensure \nparticipation and involve the private sector.

Background \n \n1.  In respect of the fact that not much attention has been given to the urban local bodies till \ndate despite the rapid pace of urbanization, the policy dialogue under the Project confirmed the \nneed to establish a special commission/committee at the highest level in order to consider \nstrengthening of urban local governments in a comprehensive manner. In particular, during \ndiscussions with the minister of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives, it \nwas  suggested  that  the  Project  would  provide  the  framework  for  such  a  committee.  As \nstipulated during the discussions with the minister, the activities of this committee may include, \namong others, the preparation of the National Urban Sector Policy for cabinet approval, review \nand revision of the 1977 Pourashava Ordinance, and examination of other critical issues for \nsustainable urban development. \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n \n2.  The TA will provide necessary technical and secretarial support to the Committee on \nUrban Local Governments (CULG) in the following key policy areas, which were identified \nduring the policy dialogue carried out by the ADB mission: \n   \n(i)  In  consultation  with  various  stakeholders  in  the  urban  sector,  prepare  the \nNational Urban Sector Policy for cabinet approval, containing recommendations, \namong others, on the approach to be followed in the process and the pattern of \nurbanization in Bangladesh; identify the nature of existing urban problems; and \nanalyze the reasons underlying the inability of city corporations and Pourashavas \nto provide essential services to city dwellers.  \n(ii)  Review the existing holding tax system in the country and suggest reforms for \nimproving collection of holding taxes from public and private sector entities as \nwell as solving the problem of recurrent arrears of such taxes.   \n(iii)  Make recommendations for the amendment of the 1977 Pourashava Ordinance \nto  reflect  the  needs  for  improved  local  governance  and  better  urban \nmanagement. \n(iv)  Review  the  Government\u2019s  long-term  strategy  for  municipal  development \n(covering  upazila  towns  and  Pourashavas)  and  make  recommendations  for \npreparing a master plan for future development of these key urban centers. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n3.  Given the issues to be addressed, the members of CULG should be senior political \nleaders and officials representing all tiers of government. The Chairman should have power to \nco-opt additional members if appropriate. The composition of the Committee will be as follows: \n \n(i)  Minister for Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives \n(Chairperson); \n(ii)  Reputed senior urban development specialist; \n(iii)  One member of parliament; \n(iv)  Mayor of Dhaka City Corporation;  \n(v)  Secretary, Local Government Division (LGD); \n(vi)  Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Public Works; \n(vii)  Secretary, Finance Ministry; \n(viii)  Secretary, Planning Ministry; \n(ix)  Secretary, Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division \n(x)  Secretary, Ministry of Women and Children Affairs ", "Appendix 12  47 \n(xi)  Chief engineer, Local Government Engineering Department (LGED); \n(xii)  Chief engineer, Department of Public Health Engineering; \n(xiii)  Director general, Health Directorate; \n(xiv)  Director general, Bureau of NGO Affairs; \n(xv)  Director general, National Institute of Local Governments; \n(xvi)  Director general, Department of Environment; \n(xvii)  Director, Urban Development Directorate;  \n(xviii)  President of the Association of Pourashava Chairpersons; \n(xix)  Two Chairpersons of Pourashavas two commissioners (1 women); \n(xx)  President, Supreme Court Bar Association; \n(xxi)  President, Federation  of Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry;  \n(xxii)  President, Association of Development Agencies in Bangladesh;  \n(xxiii)  President, Federal Union of Journalists; \n(xxiv)  President, Bangladesh Women\u2019s Association/Parishad;  \n(xxv)  President, Bangladesh Institute of Planners;  \n(xxvi)  Chairman, Center for Urban Studies; \n(xxvii)  Two distinguished citizens (1 woman); and \n(xxviii) Member secretary (concerned joint secretary). \n \n4.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n   \nSector identified as a National Priority in             Yes  Sector identified as a National Priority in               \nCountry Poverty Analysis?  Country Poverty Partnership Agreement?         Yes \n \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reducing poverty in Bangladesh: \n \nThe incidence of poverty, as measured by the costs of basic needs poverty line, fell from 58.8% in 1992 to 49.8% in \n2000. A sector breakdown of poverty shows that progress on reducing poverty incidence was almost equal across \nurban and rural areas: the urban headcount rate declined from 44.9% to 36.6% (by 8.3%) while rural poverty \ndeclined from 61.2% to 53.0% (by 8.2%). However, the moderate reduction in urban poverty during the last decade \nwas accompanied by a notable increase in urban income inequality, as the Gini coefficient increased from 0.398 to \n0.452. \n \nThe situations have been somewhat different in the case of absolute numbers of the poor in urban and rural areas. \nIn 1992, the number of urban poor was 6.5 million while the total urban population was 14.6 million. This then \nincreased to 9.3 million in 2000. Thus there was at least a 43% growth of the urban poor population during the last \ndecade. The rural poor population, on the other hand, recorded a decline in its absolute number from 57.6 million to \n53.5 million. The principal reason behind this phenomenon is the large-scale shift of the rural population to the \nurban areas in the hope of better economic opportunities. The labor force in urban towns is composed primarily of \nmigrants. It is also dominated by youth. The urban poor in the slums have very low levels of education and hardly \nany skills. About 40% of the population aged 5-15 years are not attending school. Sixty to eighty percent of the \nurban labor force is in the informal sector depending on the size of the city. Female migrants in small towns lack \nemployment opportunities in both the formal and informal sector. An increasing number of urban poor especially the \nyouth, are being employed in socially unproductive or unacceptable occupations, like extortion, begging, and \nprostitution. \n \nIf the current trend of migration continues, the urban poor will increase to 25-30% of the total country's poor by \n2020, if not more. This points to the growing need to address adverse impacts of unplanned and uncontrolled \nurbanization and promote balanced urban development. In particular, the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) urban \nsector strategy in Bangladesh has recognized the strategic importance of secondary towns in the urbanization \nprocess, and the need to promote them to lead a sound and balanced urban development. The concentration of \npopulation and activities in a few metropolitan areas has aggravated urban environmental conditions in the absence \nof adequate capacities to manage urban growth. Recognizing diseconomies of congestion and deteriorating living \nconditions of the urban poor in metropolitan cities, ADB has already provided five loans totaling $208 million for \nurban infrastructure projects in secondary towns since the start of its operations in Bangladesh in the late 1980s. \nThe proposed Project will further contribute to the achievements made so far by improving urban governance and \ninfrastructure services in secondary towns.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis      Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \nUnder the Project, low-income families were identified based on their monthly incomes. The households with \nmonthly incomes of less than Tk4,700 ($81) are classified as poor and those with monthly incomes of less than \nTk3,400 ($59) as hard-core poor. The household survey shows that about 35% of the population in the project \ntowns are classified as poor and around 15% as hard-core poor.  \n \nThe direct impact of the Project on poverty reduction is employment generation arising from the construction phase. \nThe unskilled labor content of the Project is estimated at Tk298 million, equivalent to 11,160 person-years. While \nthe gender ratio of unskilled labor employment is difficult to estimate, it is anticipated that at least one third of the \nunskilled labor person-years will be destined for women. The Gender Action Plan under the Project also assures \nthat women workers will get fair wages relative to the male workers.  \n \nThe Project will also benefit the poor through direct support for environmental improvement and income generation. \nThe integrated package of services (low-cost sanitation, microcredit, and community-based waste management, \netc.) to be provided will have a significant impact on the living conditions of poor people.  Raising environmental \nconditions will also mitigate the incidence of waterborne and vectored diseases, with consequent reduction in \nmortality and morbidity rates. Currently, environmental conditions in the Project towns are grossly unsatisfactory, \nand fewer than 50% have access to sanitary facilities. Wastes from community latrines, where provided, frequently \ncontaminate the groundwater. During monsoon times, conditions are particularly unhygienic.  \n ", "Appendix 13  51 \n \n \nAn important element of the Pourashava Poverty Reduction Action Plan is the focus on increasing self-reliance \nwithin the low-income and poor communities, with particular emphasis on the involvement of women and jobless \nyouth in community activities.  Specific funds are allocated for income-generating activities, skills development, and \nbasic health services with assistance from nongovernment organizations.  In addition, the Project will ensure privacy \nfor women by providing adequate facilities for women in public toilets and transportation facilities.   \nBenefits to poor  Gender Benefits  Benefits to minorities/indigenous \n  groups \nUrban Governance Improvement Component \nWomen  and  youth  from  poor  and  Female  ward  commissioners  will  Indigenous  peoples  specialist  will \nlow-income  households  will  be  receive a separate training for their  be engaged at PIU to ensure that \nprovided  with  small  funds  for  role  in  managing  municipal  affairs.  the benefits of the project reach the \nincome- generating activities.

Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) and financial internal rates of return (FIRRs), \nas appropriate, were prepared for representative subprojects in accordance with the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban \nDevelopment Sector Projects. EIRRs were prepared for roads, drainage, and slum improvement \ncomponents,  and  FIRRs  for  water  supply,  and  municipal  facilities.  The  evaluations  are \nsummarized in Tables A14.1 and A14.2. \n \n2.  The basic assumptions used in economic analysis are that (i) economic costs are based \non June 2002 prices; (ii) both capital cost and operation and maintenance (O&M) cost estimates \nwere apportioned into traded and nontraded components and labor; (iii) using a domestic price \nnumeraire, financial prices (based on June 2002 prices and reduced by duties and taxes) were \nconverted  to  economic  prices  by  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.05  for  traded  cost \ncomponents and 1.0 for nontraded cost components; (iv) a shadow wage rate factor of 0.87 was \nused for skilled and 0.67 for unskilled labor to reflect unemployment and underemployment; (v) \nannual  O&M  cost  is  assumed  to  be  0.5%  of  capital  cost,  and  periodic  (every  6  years) \nmaintenance cost 3% of capital cost; and (vi) subprojects were assessed for a period that \ninclude project implementation and 20 years of benefits, with no allowance for the residual value \nof assets at the end of the evaluation period. \n \n3.  Financial analyses are conducted in June 2002 prices taking into account incremental \nO&M. Basic assumptions used in the computation of the FIRR include the following: (i) all \nrevenues and costs are expressed at constant June 2002 prices on an incremental basis; (ii) \nproject  investment  costs  were  derived  from  the  estimated  base  costs  and  physical \ncontingencies, but without considering price contingencies and interest during construction; and \n(iii) capital expenditures are recorded at the time when they are incurred, while interest and \ndepreciation are excluded. \n \nA.  Drainage   \n \n4.  Under  phase  1,  primary  and  secondary  drains  of  83.35  kilometers  (km)  in  21 \nPourashavas will be upgraded and extended at a base cost of Tk340 million ($5.87 million).  \nThe proposed rehabilitation of the drainage system will help reduce the incidence of flooding in \na  catchment  area  of  292  hectares  benefiting  71,695  properties.  Economic  evaluation  was \nprepared  for  all  schemes  within  a  Pourashava  because  linkages  between  drains  result  in \nbenefits that are not always discrete to an individual scheme. The improved drainage network \nwill help reduce damage to houses, household goods, crops, and business activity in the areas \npresently experiencing inundation. The improvements will further result in increased value of \nland in the catchment area. \n \n5.  For economic benefit, the annual flood damage to movable and immovable household \nproperty was quantified based on the findings of a socioeconomic survey carried out under the \nPPTA.  The  annual  average  damage  cost  was  estimated  between  Tk1,400  and  Tk2,715 \ndepending on the type of the property. The number of properties is based on the Pourashavas \nestimates  of  the  properties  expected  to  be  benefited  within  the  catchments  area  of  each \nproposed scheme. Allowance is made for the unit benefit to rise by 2% per annum in the future, \nas against the forecast growth of around 5% in the gross domestic product per capita.    \n ", "54  Appendix 14 \n6.  The economic evaluations, which also take into account the incremental maintenance \ncosts, estimated the overall EIRR at 34.0 percent (individual EIRRs range from 12.1% to \n73.7%). However, actual EIRR could be even higher, given that the rehabilitated drainage \nsystem will generate additional benefits that are difficult to quantify: (i) reduced damage to motor \nvehicles and public infrastructure such as roads; (ii) reduced loss of personal income when \nemployment is disrupted; (iii) reduced waterlogging from rainwater into residential areas (the \nstagnant and contaminated water becomes the source of mosquito breeding); (iv) reduced \ndegradation of urban environmental conditions; (v) reduced incidence of waterborne diseases \nwithin the community, which would result in reduction of childhood prenatal and postnatal illness \nand mortality rates; and (vi) reduced disruption to personal and community life caused by slow \ndispersal of storm water, etc. \n \nB.  Roads \n \n7.  Investments  are  aimed  at  improvement  to  a  variety  of  surfaces  and  alignments  of \nexisting  roads,  plus  some  road  widening.  There  is  no  new  road  construction.  In  all,  293 \nindividual schemes have been submitted by 21 Pourashavas for inclusion under phase 1. The \ncost of all except four individual schemes is well below the ADB\u2019s cut-off rate for analysis of \n$200,000 (Tk11.6 million).  \n \n8.  While submitting the proposal for the road rehabilitation schemes, the Pourashavas were \nasked to carry out a 12-hour traffic count to support the need for the upgradation. Although the \nPourashavas have submitted a broad traffic count for each scheme, their reliability cannot be \nfully assessed. The economic analysis therefore has been carried out for the four schemes \ncosting  above  $200,000,  and  a  few  other  representative  schemes  to  demonstrate  their \nfeasibility.  \n \n9.  The improved road network will result in reduction in traffic congestion and accidents, \nsavings in travel time and vehicle operating costs, and safer conditions for pedestrians and non-\nmotorized traffic. The main objective of investment in urban roads is to reduce user costs of \ndifferent vehicle types, which means the reduction of cost to the travelers in moving from one \nlocation to another.  \n \n10.  For benefit analysis, vehicle operating costs have been classified into the following \ngroups:  (i)  distance-dependent  costs,  which  vary  directly  with  distances  covered  (e.g., \nconsumption of fuel, lubricants, wear and tear of tires, and repair and maintenance); (ii) speed-\ndependent costs, which arise out of low speed because of poor/bad condition of roads; and (iii) \ntime-dependent costs. \n \n11.  In the secondary towns, the most prevalent vehicle type is the rickshaw, and these have \ntherefore been considered for benefit calculation. The difference in the time saved due to \nincreased speed under \"without\u201d and \u201cwith\" project situations was allotted a time value. In the \nwithout project situation, pedalling 1 km requires 12.5 minutes, whereas under the improved \nsituation  the  required  time  would  be  reduced  to  7.5  minutes/km.  This  time  saved  after \nimprovement would be available for additional trips, resulting in benefits. The saving has been \nconverted into a benefit assuming that a rickshaw puller charges Tk3 per km.   \n \n12.  The individual EIRRs assessed for the selected road schemes range between 13.4% \nand 74.8% above the economic opportunity cost of capital, which is 12% for Bangladesh. The \nsensitivity analysis also indicates the robustness of the EIRR with respect to the changes in \neconomic benefits and costs. ", "Appendix 14  55 \n \nC.  Water Supply \n \n13.  A water supply component under the Project will generally involve rehabilitation of and \nextension to existing systems. Therefore, the incremental volume sold will be calculated by \nsubtracting the estimated existing volume sold from the projected annual volume sold. To \nassess the financial viability of a typical water supply component, a financial evaluation was \nprepared for the water supply component in Lakshmipur. The capacity of the existing production \nwells in the Pourashava is approximately 2,500 cubic meters per day or about 33% of the daily \nrequirements, estimated at 7,500 cubic meters per day.  In terms of geographical coverage, the \npresent water distribution network serves 2,280 out of 12,200 households. In view of the rapidly \ndeteriorating situation, it is proposed to construct two production tubewells, a treatment plant, an \noverhead tank, and 8 km of distribution pipelines of 100-250 millimeters diameter at a total base \ncost of Tk36.1 million. \n \n14.  The subproject will be funded as 70% loan and 20% grant from the Government. The \nPourashava will meet the remaining 10% from its own resources. The loan portion will carry \ninterest at 7% with an amortization period of 20 years including the 5-year grace period.  \n \n15.  For revenue calculation, it is assumed that the water tariff will rise in real terms by 5% \nduring the FY2003. Upon completion of the new scheme, the tariff will increase in real term by \n15% in the year of commissioning and thereafter by 5% on an annual basis. The incremental \noperating  cost  of  the  scheme  is  estimated  at  7%  of  the  cost  of  the  scheme.  Based  the \nincremental revenue and costs, the base FIRR is calculated as 10.3% compared with the \nweighted average cost of capital of 6.1%. Sensitivity tests indicate that the FIRR is most \nsensitive to the decrease in revenue.   \n \n16.  The field visit to the town revealed that the domestic users of the subconnections are \nwilling to pay more than the current water tariff payment of Tk150 per month provided the quality \nof  service  is  improved.  The  experience  from  other  externally  funded  projects  (e.g.,  the \nNetherlands assistance program) shows that households were willing to pay even when the \ncharges were increased by 150% to a maximum 250%. When the tariff increase was 100%, the \ncollection efficiency reached as high as 79%. An affordability analysis shows that overall the \nwater supply charges are affordable, taking into account the low level of even median-income \nhouseholds. The percentage of median income required to pay water charges would be no \nmore than 4-5%.   \n \nD.  Solid Waste Disposal \n \n17.  The solid waste service is paid for through the conservancy element of the holding tax, \nand the maximum levy permitted under Pourashava Ordinance is 7% of the eligible tax base. \nSince all property holders must pay the tax, there are no incremental users of the service, and \ntherefore no FIRR can be calculated. Instead, a cost recovery analysis has been carried out for \nall Pourashavas to assess the adequacy of revenues to recover the cost associated with solid \nwaste service (except for Mehepur, which does not levy the conservancy tax). Revenues are \nestimated by the conservancy element of the holding tax projections.  \n \n18.  While it is desirable that revenues should cover all costs, including depreciation and \nrecurrent costs for O&M, it is anticipated that only eight Pourashavas will achieve full cost \nrecovery without a significant improvement of tax revenues. Since the poor cost recovery is \nrelated to general problems with tax assessment and collection, during project implementation, ", "56  Appendix 14 \nparticipating Pourashavas will be required to adopt several measures to expand the tax base as \nwell as increase the overall holding tax revenues at least by 5-10% a year.  \n \nE.  Municipal Facilities \n \n19.  Financial  analyses  for  municipal  facilities  (e.g.,  transport  terminals,  markets,  and \nslaughterhouses) are prepared in consideration of the Local Government Division\u2019s directive \nthat, while Pourashavas may provide these services, they should be operated by the private \nsector.  Revenues for these activities will be derived from leasing the facilities, and are based on \ninvestment recovery over 5 years, plus a 2% real annual increase of rental fee. Costs are \nassociated with regular O&M of the facilities, estimated at 2.5% of fixed asset gross book value. \nThe implementation period of the municipal facilities varies significantly: blocks of public toilets \ncan be leased immediately upon completion; the construction of slaughterhouses will take one \nyear, truck terminals 2 years, and bus terminals 3 years based on the experience with the \nSecondary Towns Infrastructure Development Project  II.   \n \n20.  For markets, it is assumed that Pourashavas will lease out shops to individuals rather \nthan to a single leaseholder. Four different development levels are proposed (41, 62, 75, and 83 \nshops), depending on the size of the Pourashava. It is estimated that 60% of the total floor area \nwill be leased out, with each shop having a floor area of 11.24 square meters. The rental per \nsquare meter is Tk200 per month, with a real annual increase of 2%. Additional income will be \nobtained from trade licenses, assessed at Tk500 per annum. O&M is 2.5% of fixed assets.  \n \n21.  Financial evaluations were prepared to develop different types of municipal facilities: The \nFIRR is estimated at 12.9% for a bus terminal in Narsinghdi, 19.1% for a slaughterhouse in \nNarayanganji, and 14.5% for markets in Mehepur.   \n \nF.  Slum Improvement \n \n22.  The  slum  improvement  component  consists  of  provision  of  tubewells,  pit  latrines, \ndustbins and street lighting, plus construction of footpaths and microdrainage. The scope of the \nphysical investments in each slum area is based on the number of low-income households. \nSince most activities under the slum improvement component are aimed at reducing morbidity \nlevels through the introduction of higher sanitation standards, one of the benefits could be \nhealth expenditure savings. However, since family health expenditure data collected by the \nsocioeconomic survey are not entirely reliable, benefits are taken in the form of productivity \ngains, quantified as follows: (i) 10 working days equivalent gained by the wage earner, (ii) 10 \nworking days equivalent gained by the housekeeper from reduced child morbidity levels, and (iii) \n30 minutes per day saved by women due to the closer proximity of clean piped water supplies.  \nFor economic analysis, it is conservatively assumed that the economic value of the nonwage \nearner\u2019s time is 20% of the wage earner\u2019s income. Despite this relatively modest evaluation of \nproductivity gains, the base EIRRs for all 22 towns were estimated above the cut-off rate of \n12%.
