During the February 2004 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for Bangladesh, the Government of Bangladesh  reconfirmed its request for a \nproject preparatory technical assistance (TA) from ADB to prepare the proposed Power Sector \nDevelopment Program II, which has been included in the 2004\u20132006 country strategy and \nprogram update. The ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Dhaka during 29 February to 11 March \n2004  and  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  objective,  scope, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and consultants\u2019 outline terms of \nreference for the TA.1 A preliminary framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Bangladesh\u2019s annual per capita electricity consumption of 110 kilowatt-hours in fiscal \nyear (FY) 2003 was the fourth lowest among the developing member countries of ADB, after \nAfghanistan, Cambodia, and Nepal.2 Despite intensive efforts to increase coverage, only about \n31% of the population has access to electricity. Consumption of electricity in Bangladesh grew \nat an average annual rate of 8.2% from FY1994 to FY2002, in line with the forecast made in the \n1995 Power System Master Plan Study financed by ADB.3 The current installed capacity is \n4,710 megawatts (MW). However, the effective installed capacity is only about 4,300 MW \nbecause some ageing power plants have been derated. With a combined average forced \noutage and scheduled maintenance of about 600 MW, the available generation capacity is \nabout 3,700 MW. The peak demand met was 3,622 MW on 17 August 2003. Inadequate supply \nof electricity is a major constraint to economic growth. During FY2003, load shedding in the \nrange of 5\u2013468 MW was resorted to on 210 days for a total of 767 hours. Erratic power supply \nhas tended to increase the unwillingness of consumers to pay their bills, which in turn has led to \nshortages of funds for maintenance and has further aggravated the situation.  Bangladesh is \nfacing an anticipated shortfall of about 2,500 MW of generating capacity during the next 5 years.  \n \n3.  To address the problems facing the power sector in the country, the Government \nadopted in 1994 the Power Sector Reforms in Bangladesh (PSRB), which was formulated in \nconsultation with the major development partners4 in the power sector. The PSRB outlined the \nreform process proposed to be followed by the Government to gradually remove the constraints \nin  the  sector  through  improvements  in  sector  and  corporate  governance,  introduction  of \ncompetition, and public-private partnerships. \n \n4.  The  PSRB  envisions,  in  the  long-term,  a  structure  of  the  power  sector  based  on \n(i) separation of sector regulation and operation; (ii) autonomy and commercial orientation of the \nsector entities; (iii) separation of generation, transmission, and distribution; and (iv) increased \nprivate  sector  participation.  Under  such  a  structure,  a  new  regulatory  authority  would  be \nresponsible  for  (i) setting  electricity  tariffs  and  determining  the  corresponding  performance \nnorms; (ii) collecting, verifying, and disseminating sector statistics; (iii) reviewing and approving \nlong-term power planning; (iv) creating and maintaining a nondiscriminatory and commercial \nbusiness environment in the sector; and (v) adjudicating disputes between sector entities. While \ntransmission will remain in the public sector, generation and distribution assets will have both \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 12 February 2004. \n2  In 2003, the annual per capita consumption was 16 kilowatt-hours in Afghanistan, 50 kilowatt-hours in Cambodia, \nand 93 kilowatt-hours in Nepal. \n3  ADB. 1993.

The objective is to eliminate monopolies and foster competition. \nCommercial  discipline  and  good  customer  service  are  expected  to  be  achieved  through \ncompetition among entities in the power sector. \n \n5.  ADB has established a long-term partnership with the Government to restructure and \nreform the power sector. ADB\u2019s power sector strategy for Bangladesh consists of (i) changes in \nthe business environment through corporatization, commercialization, and increased private \nsector participation; (ii) institutional improvements in Bangladesh Power Development Board \n(BPDB) and Dhaka Electric Supply Authority (DESA); (iii) creation of new power sector agencies \nsuch as the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh Limited (PGCB), Dhaka Electric Supply \nCompany Limited (DESCO), West Zone Power Distribution Company Limited, and Ashuganj \nPower Company Limited that could serve as role models for the power sector; (iv) enlarging the \nscope of rural electric cooperatives and promoting the development of renewable energy; and \n(v) strengthening the long-term planning and regulatory processes in the Bangladesh power \nsector. During the Local Consultative Group Meeting on Energy in August 2003, all involved \ndevelopment partners fully acknowledged the progress that the power sector in Bangladesh has \nachieved during the last decade with ADB as the lead development partner.  \n \n6.  Under the reform program supported by ADB and other development partners, the \nGovernment has made the following major achievements since 1994: \n \n(i)  creation  of  a  competitive  diverse  market  of  independent  public  and  private \ngeneration companies; \n(ii)  restructuring of the sector by transferring all transmission assets and operations to a \nnew transmission company, PGCB; \n(iii)  creation  of  a  manageable  and  competitive  environment  through  bench-marking, \ncorporatization of DESCO and West Zone Power Distribution, and restructuring of \ndistribution areas from other public-operated distribution areas; and \n(iv)  in establishing a transparent energy sector, on 10 March 2003 Parliament passed \nthe new Energy Regulatory Commission Act 2003 as the basis for establishing an \nEnergy Regulatory Commission.5 \n \n7.  With the initiation of reforms in 1994, the organization of the sector has changed. In \n1994, all generation was with BPDB; a decade later, several public-private and private sector \nentities have been licensed to construct and operate power-generating facilities. Independent \npower producers now account for about 40% of net power generation in Bangladesh. \n \n8.  In September 2001, the Government made a special budget allocation of Tk690 million \n(about 30% of its total dues) to settle its outstanding dues to BPDB and DESA. This process is \ncontinued and expanded under ADB\u2019s Power Sector Development Program6 to include DESCO \nand rural electric cooperatives, along with a comprehensive financial restructuring of the sector, \nfocused on BPDB, DESCO, DESA, and PGCB. \n \n                                                 \n5 The United States Agency for International Development and ADB are assisting the Government in establishing the \nEnergy Regulatory Commission, and in providing capacity building to comprehensively amend the existing \nlegislation, regulations, and tariffs in the sector to bring into effect the principles noted in para. 4. \n6 ADB. 2003.  Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors for the Power Sector \nDevelopment Program in Bangladesh. Manila. ", "    3 \n9.  ADB recently evaluated its power assistance program7 in Bangladesh and several key \nlessons may be drawn. At the project level, these include the need to (i) minimize extensive \ndelays  with  public  sector  project  implementation;  (ii)  improve  local  capacities  in  project \npreparation, implementation, and operation and selection of appropriate technology; (iii) improve \nownership of TA; (iv) improve financial management capacities; and (v) avoid use of piecemeal \napproaches to financing change processes such as improving financial systems. \n \n10.  At the strategic level, first, ADB\u2019s approach to sector reform, which is based on pilot \ntesting change and learning by doing, succeeded in facilitating change. By the success of the \nindividual projects and newly created entities, the approach clearly demonstrates the direction \nthat future reforms should take. Second, the pace of privatization in an environment such as \nBangladesh, especially in transmission and distribution, is likely to be slow. Prioritization is \nimportant.  Third,  attaining  commercial  viability  takes  time  and  requires  a  financial  and \ncommercial overview of the sector, particularly over issues such as tariffs and debt defaults \namong sector entities and the Government. \n \n11.  The sector assistance program evaluation concluded that ADB should maintain its role \nas coordinating development partner in the sector and is in a unique position to do so. It has a \nwide range of experience covering all areas of activity in the power sector; an excellent sectoral \noverview; key skills in its resident mission; a long-term track record of working effectively with \nthe key policy makers in the sector; and widespread support and trust in the development \npartner community, the Government, and sector entities.  ADB will continue to review and \nmonitor the reform and restructuring process and conduct regular policy dialogue with the \nGovernment. ADB will continue to assist the Government to pursue further restructuring and \ndeepen reforms to promote good governance, sector efficiencies, and greater private sector \nparticipation in the power sector.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The objective of the TA is to assist the Government, BPDB, DESCO, DESA, and PGCB \nto prepare the proposed Power Sector Development Program II, aiming to improve sector \nperformance  both  technically  and  financially.  The  Program  is  expected  to  address  issues \nconstraining sector development through continuing policy reform and restructuring of the sector \nand  complementary  investments  in  priority  projects.  The  complementary  investments  will \nfinance priority projects that will be determined by updating the 1995 Power System Master \nPlan. Studies for financial restructuring of BPDB and DESA8 and for creating BPDB as a holding \ncompany of all power sector companies will be undertaken. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Detailed  study  of  sector  structure,  financial  restructuring,  poverty  reduction,  and \ninvestment planning will be undertaken to meet the reform objectives and to facilitate greater \nprivate sector participation in the power sector. Advice on policy matters and stakeholder \ncommunication will be provided throughout TA implementation.     \n \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2003.

", "4 \n14.  The scope of work consists of (i) supporting further restructuring and deeper reforms, \nand providing policy advice; (ii) developing a short to medium-term reform agenda and a long-\nterm reform plan; (iii) proposing options for a sector structure after further unbundling of BPDB \nand  reconfiguration  of  distribution;  (iv)  reviewing  accounts  and  accounting  practice  and \npreparing financial statements for FY2004 based on international accounting standards for \nBPDB and DESA; (v) developing a 10-year financial projection model and identifying liabilities to \nbe taken over by unbundled successor entities of BPDB; (vi) updating the 1995 Power System \nMaster Plan to identify priority projects that are based on least-cost analysis; (vii) undertaking \nfinancial,  economic,  environmental,  resettlement,  and  social  analyses  of  selected  priority \nprojects  suitable  for  ADB  financing;  (viii)  assessing  the  reform  impact  on  the  poor  and \nrecommending mitigating measures; (ix) supporting communications with stakeholders; and (x) \nproviding continuing capacity building and training to the  counterpart staff on reform-related \nissues. \n \n15.  To analyze the way in which the envisaged project is linked to poverty reduction, a \npoverty  analysis  will  be  undertaken  using  data  collected  from  field  consultations.  The \nassessment will be carried for direct, indirect, and macroeconomic effects. Particular attention \nwill be paid to the affordability of upfront connection charges and monthly bills. Indicators for \nbenefit monitoring will also be prepared. Appendix 2 provides the summary initial poverty and \nsocial analysis. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.1 million equivalent, of which the foreign \nexchange cost is $679,000 and the local currency cost is $421,000 equivalent. The Government \nhas requested ADB to finance $840,000 equivalent, comprising the entire foreign exchange cost \nand a portion of the local currency cost amounting to $161,000 equivalent, on a grant basis from \nthe Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the \nremaining $260,000 equivalent of local currency costs through in-kind contributions of the \nExecuting Agency and implementing agencies. These will include office accommodation and \nfacilities,  local  communications,  counterpart  staff,  local  transportation  to  consultants  and \ncounterpart  staff  for  field  visits  in  Bangladesh,  engineering  reports,  and  other  information \nneeded for the TA. Detailed cost estimates are provided in Appendix 3. The Government has \nbeen advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project or \nprogram. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Project Management Unit (PMU) of the Power Division of the Ministry of Power, \nEnergy and Mineral Resources will be the Executing Agency for the TA. Under the supervision \nof the PMU, BPDB, DESA, DESCO, PGCB, and other distribution entities will implement the TA \nwith assistance of an international consulting firm. A coordination steering committee chaired by \nSecretary of the Power Division with a qualified and experienced representative each from \nBPDB, DESA, DESCO, PGCB, and other distribution entities will be set up before the TA \nconsultants are fielded. The TA consultants will liaise with the coordination steering committee \nand work closely with PMU and the implementing agencies, and will have full access to all \ndocuments and data required for TA implementation. The TA consultants will need to coordinate \nclosely  with  the  consultants  involved  in  the  corporatization  of  DESA  (footnote  8).  The \nimplementing agencies will each nominate a core group of staff to work as counterpart staff with \nthe TA consultants, including provision of counterpart funds and staff for field visits. PMU and \nthe  implementing  agencies  will  provide,  free  of  charge  to  the  consultant  team,  (i)  office ", "    5 \naccommodation  and  facilities,  including  secretarial  support;  (ii)  land  transportation  within \nBangladesh; and (iii) engineering inputs for the consultants\u2019 work. The consultants will pay for \ninternational  communications  connected  with  implementation  of  the  TA.  PMU  and  the \nimplementing agencies will assist the consultants in data gathering, preliminary analysis, and \nreport writing. PMU and the implementing agencies will also provide all necessary assistance to \nthe TA consultants in liaising with other government ministries and agencies, and in obtaining \nnecessary data and documentation from ministries and agencies. The TA consultants will make \ntheir own arrangements for personal computers and other facilities for production of their \nreports. The TA consultants will organize training workshops in Dhaka and provide hands-on \ntraining for the counterpart staff as part of capacity building and technology transfer.  \n \n18.  The TA will require about 20 person-months of international and 25 person-months of \ndomestic consulting services. It  will be implemented in three parts over a 7-month period, \ncommencing in October 2004 and finishing in May 2005. The consultant teams responsible for \nthe power sector reform and restructuring program and the Power System Master Plan Update \nwill be fielded  when the steering coordination committee and counterpart staff have been \nnominated. The consultant team responsible for preparing the investment projects will only be \nfielded after the Power System Master Plan has been updated to define a list of priority projects. \nOutline terms of reference for the consultants are provided in Appendix 4. The international \nconsultants  will  have  expertise  in  power  sector  restructuring,  energy  economics  and \nmacroeconomic  modeling,  financial  analysis  and  financial  management,  power  system \nplanning, least-cost generation expansion, transmission analysis and design, environmental \nassessment, resettlement, poverty assessment, and social impact analysis. A consulting firm or \nconsortium of firms will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. Consultants will be recruited through quality- and cost-based selection procedures, \nand simplified technical proposals will be requested. International consultants will procure the \nequipment to be financed under the TA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, \nthrough direct purchase procedures with quotations from at least three suppliers. \n \n19.  The consultants will submit an inception report focusing on the work program no later \nthan 2 weeks after commencing their services. An interim report and a draft final report will be \nsubmitted 2 months and 5 months after inception, respectively. The consultants will carry out all \nits tasks in Bangladesh, including preparation of reports, to maximize capacity building and \ntechnology transfer. Tripartite meetings will be held in Dhaka to discuss the inception, interim, \nand draft final reports. The consultants will prepare status reports for their specific scope of \nworks highlighting any issues that could become critical for the timely completion of the TA. \nWithin 3 weeks after the tripartite meeting to discuss the draft final report, the consultants will \nsubmit a final report, in a format acceptable to ADB, incorporating all comments received from \nthe Government and ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $840,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bangladesh for preparing the Power Sector Development Program II, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nPRELIMINARY PROGRAM FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nGoal       \n   \nEconomic development and  New electrical connections  Quality of supply \nreduction of poverty through  within 2 months of  reports by the sector \nimproved governance, financial  applications by 2008  utilities \nand operational performance of     \nthe power sector  Competitive dispatch of  Monthly MIS reports of \n  power stations by 2006  BPDB, DESA, \n  DESCO, and PGCB  \nGradual decrease of   \nGovernment\u2019s subsidies to   \nthe power sector   \n \nPurpose       \n     \nPower sector further reformed  Power system losses  Power company MIS  Tariffs are restructured \nthrough financially restructuring  decreased from 26% to 20%  reports  to encourage energy \nof two major companies (BPDB  by 2008    conservation and \nand DESA) and long-term    ADB review missions  improve economic \nsustainability of the sector  Accounts receivable not to  growth \nwithout Government\u2019s support  exceed 2 months billing   \n    National load dispatch \n  500,000 new consumer  center operational by \n  connections  2007 \n     \n  Write off of unrealizable  Timely private and public \n  dues and part of overdue  investment in new \n  debt-servicing liabilities of  generation plants \n  BPDB and DESA.  according to current \n    government plans \nImproved customer service and  No load shedding by 2008 \nquality of supply \n \nOutputs       \n       \nFinancial restructuring of BPDB  Draft TA final report of the  Project  Quality of Government\u2019s \nand DESA assessed  consultant by March 2005  implementation  internal resources for \n  progress report and  project preparation \nPower System Master Plan  completion report   \nupdated    Availability and reliability \n  Tripartite meetings  of necessary data and \nTechnical, least-cost,  statistics \neconomic, and financial \njustification for the project \nProject procurement and \nimplementation plans, and \nbidding documents for all \ncontract packages \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nDesign  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n       \nProject administration \nmemorandum, and \nrecommended project \nmonitoring and reporting \nsystem \n \nInitial social assessment for \neach project component, and \nresettlement plans  \n \nAppropriate environmental \ncategory based on findings of \nthe project preparatory TA. \n \nDraft terms of reference and \nestimated cost of \nimplementation consulting \nservices \n \nActivities       \n       \nAssess financial restructuring of  Commencement date -  TA progress reports  No delay in TA letter \nBPDB and DESA  October 2004  signing \n   \nUpdate Power System Master  Completion date - May 2005 \nPlan \n \nCarry out economic, financial, \nenvironmental, resettlement, \nand social analyses \n \nInputs       \n       \nConsultants  20 person-months of  TA progress reports  Competent consultants \n  international and 25 person- and completion report   \n  months of domestic  Counterpart  staff  and \n  consultants  budget available on time \n   \n  ADB TA grant of $840,000 \n   \nGovernment\u2019s internal  Government provision of \nresources  $260,000 of in-kind \ncontributions \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, BPDB = Bangladesh Power Development Board, DESA = Dhaka Electric Supply Authority, \nDESCO = Dhaka Electric Supply Company Ltd., MIS = management information systems, PGCB = Power Grid Company of \nBangladesh, Ltd., TA = technical assistance. \n \n \n \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \nINITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n  \nA.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \n \nIncreased efficiency in the energy sector is an essential component for economic growth in Bangladesh. According to \nthe Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics 2000, national access to power is about 31%, which is considered to be small and \ninsufficient even by standards of low-income countries. In 2000, nationally, 12% of the poorest households had \nelectricity connections, 3% in rural and 46% in urban areas. People who have access to electricity receive poor, \nunreliable service with regular power outages and low voltage. Improved energy services are essential for the \ncountry\u2019s economic growth and other social services. Efficient power supply is essential for the manufacturing and \nservice industry, particularly the micro and small industries, including the garment sector, which employs several \nmillion poor, particularly women. Agricultural production is also dependent on energy, especially electricity.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Poverty Classification: Other \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe first block of domestic power consumption of 100 kilowatt-hour per month is subsidized in Bangladesh. In the \nfinancial year 2002 the highest electricity consumption was in the residential category. The envisaged program, which \nis similar to the Dhaka Power Transmission and Distribution Project, can be expected to have indirect benefits on the \nlives of poor people who use small amounts of electricity and women who engage in micro-level production activities \n(Greater Dhaka Power Transmission and Distribution Project Phases II and II A, Evaluation Report/EV550-1994). \n \nWhile the policy and investment components are not specifically designed to have poverty impacts, they are likely to \nresult in indirect positive impacts on the poor in terms of income and employment, and public services such as health, \neducation, and municipal services. According to Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), the following key \nimprovements are expected: (i) consumers will receive uninterrupted, improved electricity supply; (ii) commercial and \nindustrial operations will be uninterrupted; (iii) low voltage problems, which are particularly damaging to remote rural \nareas, will improve; and (iv) replacement of old lines with insulated lines will improve safety. The benefits will be in \nemployment; income; better supply of essential services like water, street lights, and diagnostic and health services; \nand cost saving for energy and maintenance of equipments with better supply of power. \n \nOn the policy side, improved governance which includes streamlining of financial operations and billing arrangements, \nand corporatizing and financial restructuring of BPDB and Dhaka Electric Supply Authority (DESA) will result in better \nservice to the public. The establishment of an independent regulator will result in transparent and consultative \nprocedures for issuing tariff rulings and distribution services. Reduced costs of products can be expected from price \nrationalization and efficiency gains. Employees will benefit from a new management structure and skills training. \n \nOn the investment side, the new peak power generation unit to be established will provide regular and improved \nelectricity supply. The new plant will provide considerable environmental benefits; cost savings on standby generators; \nand improved efficiency in the manufacturing business, including garments, pharmaceuticals, and electronics. All \ncategories of workers and particularly those in the ready-made garment industries are likely to benefit from better \nworking environments and reduced hours of work. \n \nUnstable power supply and peak period cuts affect peoples\u2019 lives in various ways. Poor, and particularly women who \nwork as frontline piece workers, are severely affected by power loss. Low income, long working hours, and sometimes \nbringing in children to make up lost hours result from unstable power supply. Many electrical items are damaged due \nto power interruption. Small business units such as photo studios, cyber cafes, beauty parlors, photocopy shops all \ncomplain of disruption to business and loss of income during power outage, especially during peak times. Health \nclinics and diagnostic services are also seriously disrupted as equipment become nonoperational due to low voltage or ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nhave a shorter service life because of constant power outage. Patients are inconvenienced by having to wait long \nhours or to return due to disruption of services. Municipal water supply and streetlights are also of poor quality due to \npower disruption. \n \nBeneficiaries expressed the need for regular and expanded power supply. Perceived benefits from an improved \nsystem include increase in income and employment through stable production activities in existing and new units. \nCosts and production losses could be minimized by reducing damage to equipment. Basic municipal and other \nservices would be improved. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \n \nIs there a participation strategy?
