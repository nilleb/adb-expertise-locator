INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Georgia has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  develop  a  national  transportation  policy.1 The  TA  has  been \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2014\u201320162 and is described in detail in \nADB\u2019s Georgia Transport Sector Assessment, Strategy, and Road Map.3 \n \n2.  ADB fielded a mission to Georgia on 5\u20138 May 2014 to consult with the government on a \njoint memorandum of understanding in which agreement was reached in principle with the \nexecuting agency, the Transport Policy Department of the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable \nDevelopment (MOESD), as to the impact, outcome, outputs, cost estimates, draft terms of \nreference, implementation arrangements, and key activities of the TA. \n.\n \n3.  The TA concept paper was approved on 28 May 2014. The design and monitoring \n  \nframework of the TA is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Since 2004, the transport sector in Georgia has undergone major transformation both in \nterms of physical infrastructure and in the manner in which transport services are delivered. \nAirport passenger throughput and cross-border truck movements have increased considerably, \nas has the efficiency of customs operations. There have also been major revisions to rules and \nregulations on the supply of transport services and infrastructure, with restructuring of transport \nbodies,  delegation  of  responsibilities  for  infrastructure  improvements  to  line  agencies,  and \nadditional private sector involvement in airlines, airports, ports, and shipping. \n \n5.  The government aims to accelerate the sector\u2019s development by increasing the capacity \nof roads, railways, ports, airports, cargo terminals, and logistics infrastructure. The current \npriorities are: (i) completion of the East\u2013West highway, which links the border with Azerbaijan \nvia Tbilisi to the Black Sea ports of Batumi and Poti, and onward to the border with Turkey at \nSarpi; (ii) the Baku\u2013Tbilisi\u2013Kars railway line; (iii) development of an international airport at \nKutaisi; and (iv) construction of a deepwater port at Anaklia. \n \n6.  The government is committed to implementing economic policies that foster sustainable \ndevelopment. However, the current low level of the private sector\u2019s competitiveness, inadequate \ndevelopment of human resources, insufficient diversification of exports, and low value addition \nare acknowledged as key impediments to growth. It is understood that capital investment in the \ntransport sector in recent years has not always been targeted at the highest-yielding projects. \nGeorgia would benefit from guidelines for prioritization of transport projects, which would enable \nGeorgia to more efficiently allocate scarce resources to competing projects across all transport \nmodes. \n \n7.  Despite investments in road and rail infrastructure, Georgia is, however, currently unable \nto handle substantial increases in cargo volumes, the cost of shipping and logistics services is \nnot  competitive,  the  proportion  of  container  freight  being  transported  by  rail  is  low  by \ninternational standards, and modern logistics facilities are lacking; Georgia was recently ranked \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 May 2014. \n2  ADB. 2013. Country Operations Business Plan: Georgia, 2014\u20132016. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2014. Georgia Transport Sector Assessment, Strategy, and Road Map. Manila. \n ", "2  \n116th of 160 countries in terms of logistics performance,4 and 103rd of 148 countries in terms of \ninternational distribution.5 \n \n8.  The government\u2019s ambition for the transport sector is to exploit Georgia\u2019s geographic \nlocation between Asia and Europe, to turn it into a regional logistics hub and business platform, \nand to upgrade its multimodal infrastructure. Having well-developed transport infrastructure is \nrecognized as an important factor in enhancing Georgia\u2019s competitiveness and realizing its full \ntransit potential. Efforts are thus expected to focus on developing transport infrastructure and \nthe logistics sector, and on trying to attract investment into these sectors and to more closely \nintegrate Georgia\u2019s transport infrastructure into international and regional transport networks. \n \n9.  However, the transport sector lacks an overall policy to guide its development in an \ninclusive and sustainable manner, which has resulted in each transport agency adopting its own \nvision, strategy, or agenda. The sector needs a comprehensive development policy, including a \nsuitable road map for each mode and respective financing arrangements. \n \n10.  Transport  institutions  are  fragmented  and  under  the  direction  of  multiple  ministries: \n(i) MOESD,  which  has  overall  responsibility  for  civil  aviation,  land,  and  maritime  transport; \n(ii) the Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure (MRDI) which is responsible for \nroads; and (iii) the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which handles policing of roads, including traffic \nsafety matters. There is a need to review the institutional structure within which transport \nservices are provided and to ensure that, in the long-term, both institutional structure and \ncoordination between agencies do not represent impediments to efficient provision of transport \nservices. \n \n11.  The Maritime Transport Agency, the Civil Aviation Agency, the Land Transport Agency, \nand  the  State  Hydrographic  Service  operate  as  technical  regulators.  However,  economic \nregulation of transport services\u2014i.e., the regulation of price, service quality, and frequency\u2014is \nrather limited for most modes and is in need of further development. The TA will also look at the \nlong-term  sustainability  of  infrastructure  investments  and  recommend  various  measures  to \nensure that transport agencies have sufficient funds to cover operation and maintenance needs. \n \n12.  Despite ongoing work by various development partners, the capacity of the various \ntransport agencies still needs to be strengthened. For example, the roads department of MRDI \nhas  evolved  into  a  network  manager  and  contract  administrator  but  would  benefit  from \nadditional staff training to facilitate more efficient delivery of projects. At the ministry level, the \nsituation also needs improvement: less than 50% of MOESD staff working on transport-related \nissues are qualified or have received formal education in a transport-related discipline, and it is \nestimated that 90% of staff members require short-term training to handle their assignments, \nwhile 20% need postgraduate specializations. There is also a clear short-term need to build \ntransport planning capacity, particularly within the Transport Policy Department of MOESD. \n \n \n                                                 \n4  World Bank.

THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact will be a safer and more efficient transport system that promotes economic \ngrowth in Georgia. The outcome will be government adoption of the transport policy and action \nplan. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The main outputs of the TA are: (i) national transport policy recommendations and action \nplan, (ii)  a long-term human resource development plan with strengthened transport planning \ncapacity for MOESD staff, and (iii) guidelines for prioritization of transport projects with provided \nsupport to transport agencies in implementation. \n \n15.  The national transport policy and action plan will assist Georgia in identifying actions \nneeded to improve the performance of the transport sector. The human resources development \nplan will help tackle the gap between current skill levels and future skill needs in the transport \nsector. The guidelines for prioritization of transport projects, along with efforts to strengthen \ntransport planning capacity in MOESD, will help Georgia plan and appraise the most worthwhile \ntransport projects to progress, while support will be provided to assist transport agencies in \nimplementing  both  the  guidelines  for  prioritization  of  transport  projects,  and  key \nrecommendations of the national transport policy and action plan.  \n \n16.  One of the key focuses of the TA will be to support the development of the logistics \nindustry. The consultants will therefore collect basic data on logistics in Georgia (e.g., surveys of \nlogistics services providers, forwarders and users, logistics costs for various types of goods) \nand review the existing stage of logistics development in Georgia. This review will focus on \neconomic, legal, organizational, institutional and regulatory issues, and will identify key issues \nhindering the development of the logistics industry. The consultants will also review international \nbest  practice,  and  make  recommendations  designed  to  speed  up  the  development  of  the \nlogistics industry in Georgia. \n \n17.  The consultants will be required to undertake detailed consultations during two key \nstages of the TA: (i) at inception, and (ii) upon completion of draft findings. Consultations will \ninvolve  extensive  meetings  with  relevant  ministries,  transport  agencies,  local  government, \ndevelopment banks, nongovernment organizations, representatives of the private sector such \nas logistics companies, and the public. \n \n18.  Before drafting the national transport policy, the consultants will produce a report on \ncurrent issues and likely future challenges in the transport sector. This will be disseminated to \nmembers  of  the  steering  committee  (para.  25)  and  will  be  reviewed  to  ensure  that  the \nconsultants  have  an  adequate  understanding  of current  and  future  issues in  the  transport \nsector. \n \n19.  The consultants will review current human resource development issues in the transport \nsector before producing a draft human resource development plan and submitting it to the \nsteering committee for comments. \n \n20.  The consultants will produce a draft national transport policy and action plan, a long-term \nhuman resource development plan, and guidelines for prioritization of transport projects and \n ", "4  \nsubmit them to the steering committee for comments. Documents are to be finalized based on \ncomments received from the steering committee and during the second round of stakeholder \nconsultations. The consultants should finalize documents no later than 4 weeks after receipt of \ncomments. Prior to completion of the final transport policy and action plan, the consultants will \npropose to the steering committee where consultancy support should be given to transport \nbodies responsible for implementing the guidelines for prioritization of transport projects, the \nnational transport policy and action plan, and the long-term human resource development plan. \nThe consultants will then deliver consultancy support as agreed with the steering committee. \n \n21.  The design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) specifies several assumptions and \nrisks. The main assumptions are: (i) the government commits to the national transport policy \nand the funding necessary to implement measures contained therein, and (ii) all stakeholders \ngive timely support to consultants in performing their assignments. The steering committee, \nwhich will include representatives of various government ministries and transport agencies, \nshould help ensure that all assumptions are delivered upon. The main risks are: (i) deterioration \nof economic conditions resulting in reduced budget available for transport projects, (ii) lack of \nsupport from transport agencies for required sector reform, and (iii) prolonged decision making \ndelaying acceptance of TA outputs. The risks can be partially mitigated by ADB and PPTA \nconsultants through proactive engagement with all relevant stakeholders. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n22.  The TA is estimated to cost $825,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, basic office supplies, and other \nin-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  MOESD will be the executing agency for this TA, and will be responsible for providing \nthe government\u2019s in-kind contributions of office space (suitable for five consultants), basic office \nsupplies, and counterpart staff. The Transport and Communications Division of ADB\u2019s Central \nand West Asia Department will administer the TA. \n \n24.  A steering committee will be formed to guide TA development. The steering committee \nwill consist of high-level representatives of MOESD, MRDI, Roads Department, port authorities, \ncustoms, Ministry of Finance, Georgian Railways, and other key stakeholders in the transport \nindustry, such as the private sector, development agencies, and nongovernment organizations. \nMOESD will chair the steering committee and act as its secretariat, reporting regularly to the \nsteering committee and ADB on the progress of the TA. MOESD will designate a project director, \nwho will be the primary MOESD focal person for the TA prior to mobilization of consultants. \n \n25.  The TA will be implemented over 28 months, from September 2014 to December 2016. \nIt will engage 20 person-months of intermittent individual international consulting input and 18 \nperson-months of intermittent individual national consulting input. The international consultants \nwill comprise a transport planner, a transport economist, and a human resource development \nspecialist. The national consultants will comprise a transport specialist and an institutional and \nregulatory specialist. All experts shall be recruited through the individual consultant selection \nmethod and in keeping with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). All equipment will \n ", "  5\nbe procured in line with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). It \nis envisaged that throughout the TA, external experts in specialist areas such as climate change \nwill be brought in as resource persons to provide guidance and review. \n \n26.  During TA implementation, training, workshops, and seminars will be held as needed. \nThese may cover, but not be limited to, the development of the TA, transport planning, human \nresource development issues, and prioritization of transport projects. \n \n27.  The consultants will be required to submit the following deliverables to the government \nand ADB: (i) an inception report within 4 weeks of commencement of services; (ii) a draft review \nof  the  existing  state  of,  and  future  challenges  for,  the  transport  sector  within  \n12 weeks of commencement of services; (iii) a draft human resource plan for the transport \nsector within 24 weeks of commencement of services; (iv) draft guidelines for prioritization of \ntransport projects within 24 weeks of commencement of services; (v) a draft transport policy \nwithin 36 weeks of commencement of services; (vi) a final transport policy within 44 weeks of \ncommencement  of  services;  and  (vii)  a  final  report  upon  completion  of  assignment.  The \nconsultants will also be required to submit progress reports to ADB and the government every 4 \nweeks throughout the TA. \n \n28.  It is envisaged that the main TA outputs\u2014the national transport policy and action plan, \nthe long-term human resource development plan, and guidelines for prioritization of transport \nprojects\u2014will be published by the government. The other deliverables, including presentations \nand documentation produced as part of the output on developing transport planning capacity, \nwill be disseminated to the steering committee. The TA consultants will be responsible for \nproposing a plan outlining how outputs of the TA will be further disseminated. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n29.

Introduction \n \n1.  Under  the  technical  assistance  (TA),  38  person-months  of  consultant  services \n(20 international and 18 national) will be provided through individual consultants to help the \nGovernment of Georgia formulate a transport sector policy. The consultants will be recruited \naccording to the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). \n \n2.  The individual international and national consultants will work closely with the Transport \nand  Communications  Division  of  ADB\u2019s  Central  and  West  Asia  Department,  which  is \nresponsible  for  administering  this  TA.  The  Transport  Policy  Department  of  the  Ministry  of \nEconomy and Sustainable Development (MOESD) will be the executing agency. \n \nB.  Composition of Consultants \n \n3.  The consultant team will comprise three international individual consultants and two \nnational individual consultants. The international consultants will comprise (i) a transport planner \n(10 person-months), (ii) a transport economist (5 person-months), and (iii) a human resource \ndevelopment specialist (5 person-months). The transport planner will also serve as the team \nleader and coordinate the inputs of all international and national specialists, and the delivery of \nthe TA. The national consultants will comprise a transport specialist (12 person-months) and an \ninstitutional and regulatory specialist (6 person-months). It is envisaged that, in addition to the \nconsultant team, ADB will bring in external peer reviewers as resource persons. \n \n4.  Transport planner (international 10.0 person-months). The transport planner will have  \n(i) at least a master\u2019s degree (or equivalent) in transport planning or civil engineering or other \nrelevant field, (ii) at least 15 years relevant professional experience, and (iii) a relevant work \nexperience in Georgia or a similar Developing Member Countries (DMC).
