I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the \nGreater Colombo Water and Wastewater Management Improvement Investment Program.1 The \ninvestment  program  will  finance  a  portion  of  government  initiatives  to  improve  water  and \nwastewater management services in Greater Colombo.2 It will rehabilitate and expand water \nsupply and wastewater management infrastructure. For investments in physical infrastructure to \nbe effective and sustainable, the investment program will assist the government in introducing \ninstitutional reforms in the water and wastewater subsectors, particularly in Greater Colombo.3  \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  Water. About 95% of Colombo,4 the capital city and economic and administrative hub of \nthe country, is covered by a piped water supply system. Because the system has low and \nfluctuating system pressure and intermittent supply, some areas of the city receive water only in \noff-peak hours and others receive water for an average of only 6\u201310 hours a day. Many parts of \nthe distribution network were built more than 100 years ago.5 Though there have been various \nprojects to address the increasing water demand, significant network rehabilitation has not been \ncarried out; nonrevenue water (NRW) remains around 49%.6 The National Water Supply and \nDrainage Board (NWSDB), under the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage (MWSD), supplies \npiped  water  to  127,000  metered  service  connections  in  Colombo;  in  the  underserved \nsettlements,  about  3,200  standposts  are  not  metered.  The  water  tariff  is  below  full  cost \nrecovery. To enhance water conservation through the standposts in underserved settlements, \nNWSDB has launched various pilot programs across the country and specifically in Colombo. \nThese programs need to be implemented on a larger scale. \n \n3.  Wastewater. According to the United Nations Development Programme, in 2008, 66% \nof the Greater Colombo population had on-site sanitation facilities; 25% had sewerage systems; \nand 9% had no facilities and disposed of waste on the seashore, into canals and waterways, \nand on available open ground. The various sewerage systems operating within Greater Colombo \nare currently estimated to serve 140,000 households. The sewer network, built from 1906 to \n2007, comprises about 320 kilometers (km) of sewers, 18 pumping stations in two catchments \n(north and south), and two sea outfalls. The sewer lines have frequent collapses and blockages, \nand  one-third  of  the  pumping  facilities  are  not  working,  causing  frequent  overflow  into \nwatercourses. The  Colombo  Municipal  Council  (CMC)  owns  and  operates  the  wastewater \ninfrastructure services in Colombo, and is the only municipal body handling such service in the \ncountry. NWSDB manages wastewater facilities outside the CMC area. NWSDB has introduced \na sewerage tariff within its operating jurisdiction and has a dedicated account for sewerage \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Greater Colombo comprises 15 local authorities: five municipal councils (Colombo, Dehiwela\u2013Mount Lavinia, and \nSri Jayawardenepura\u2013Kotte, Kaduwela, and Moratuwa), five urban councils, and five pradeshiya sabhas (smallest \npolitical units in peri-urban or rural areas). It has a population of more than 838,000 and a floating population of \nmore than 500,000. \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) for the Colombo \nWater Supply Service Improvement Project in 2011. Supplementary PPTA was provided in 2012. \n4  The 37 square kilometer area under the Colombo Municipal Council has a population of about 700,000. \n5  About 700 kilometers (km) of the 927 km of water supply distribution network in Colombo is more than 50 years old. \n6  The 49% NRW for Colombo, which is twice the national average NRW, comprises 33% physical losses, 5% \ncommercial losses, and 11% free water supplied to low-income informal settlements. ", "2   \nservices.7 However, the sewerage operation in CMC is not separate from other operations and \nCMC has no independent accounting for its sewerage operation. Aside from property taxes, \nCMC does not impose a separate wastewater tariff. \n \n4.  NRW reduction. NWSDB\u2019s limited network rehabilitation and leak repairs under routine \noperation and maintenance (O&M) have had little impact on NRW reduction. A focused program \nof pipe replacement and metering, implemented in a small part of the critical area8 in Colombo \nwith funding from  the  Japan International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),9brought  about  local \nimprovements. According to the water balance for Colombo dated January 2012, the estimated \nannual revenue losses associated with NRW are more than SLRs1.7 billion ($13 million). The \ngovernment recognizes that focused efforts, including citywide NRW reduction and institutional \nreforms, are needed to improve service and increase water availability in Colombo, and manage \nthe increasing demand. However, these plans are hampered by lack of budget and institutional \nreforms.  The  high  rate  of  NRW  remains  the  greatest  obstacle  to  improving  NWSDB\u2019s \nperformance and financial viability. \n \n5.  Sector  constraints.  The  key  sector  constraints  for  Greater  Colombo  include \n(i) inefficient and unreliable infrastructure performance, as a result of inadequate asset planning \nand management and associated investments, (ii) inadequate and fragmented organizational \nstructures  that  do  not  promote  accountability  and  performance,  (iii)  low  cost  recovery  (for \nsewerage), and (iv) inadequate operating and monitoring capacity of service providers. \n \n6.  Road map. The MFF is to support the government in achieving its water supply and \nwastewater sector targets under its development policy framework (DPF), which has objectives \nto  (i)  reduce  and  manage  NRW  holistically  and  sustainably;  (ii)  improve  governance, \nmanagement capacity, and accountability within NWSDB and CMC; and (iii) improve water and \nwastewater service delivery and amounts in Greater Colombo. 10 It includes plans to increase \nthe national coverage of piped water supply from 37% to 60%, and piped sewerage from 2.5% \nto  7%  during  2010\u20132020.  Improving  municipal  services,  specifically  in  water  supply  and \nwastewater, is a key government priority. The government recognizes that focused efforts, \nincluding Colombo citywide NRW reduction and institutional reforms, are necessary to improve \nservice and increase water availability in Colombo to manage increasing demand. \n \n7.  Policy and regulatory framework. Under the DPF, in 2010 MWSD adopted the National \nDrinking Water Policy and the National Policy on Sanitation to provide guidance to NWSDB, \nprovincial  councils,  local  authorities,  lending  institutions,  and  organizations  involved  in \ndelivering water supply and sanitation services. In 2003, Parliament authorized the formation of \nthe Public Utilities Commission to regulate electricity, petroleum, and water tariffs. Despite \nseveral drafts of the NWSDB Water Bill and amendments to the NWSDB Act, water tariff \nregulation is still not in place under the commission. But even without an independent water \nregulatory framework, NWSDB still managed to increase tariffs to meet operating requirements, \nmost recently in 2009. Further tariff increases are necessary for full cost recovery. \n                                                \n7  The cabinet approved the introduction of a sewerage charge in September 2002. Subsequently, NWSDB approved \na sewerage tariff policy and a specific tariff structure, which MWSD approved. A new sewerage tariff was gazetted \nin October 2007 and implemented in March 2008. As part of system computerization at NWSDB, the water bill form \nwas modified and the sewerage charge was incorporated into the water bill. \n8  North  of  Colombo  and  covering  12  square  km,  the  area  comprises  Kotahena,  Modera,  Grandpass,  and \nMattakkuliya. \n9  The  JICA  project  includes  replacement  of  pipes,  provision  of  individual  connections,  renewal  of  service \nconnections, and geographic information system mapping. \n10 Government of Sri Lanka. 2010. Mahinda Chintana: Vision for a New Sri Lanka, 2010\u20132020, Colombo. ", "    3 \n \n8.  Government strategy and investment plan. To achieve the DPF targets for water \nsupply and sanitation for Greater Colombo, NWSDB and CMC need to provide the population \nwith (i) full coverage and 24-hour water supply in Colombo and universal safe water supply in \nGreater  Colombo;  and  (ii)  universal  sanitation  coverage  in  Greater  Colombo,  with  100% \nconnection to public sewers in Colombo. NWSDB and CMC have adopted an investment plan \ncomprising intervention and project requirements to achieve these targets.11 The plan envisions \ninvestments of $1,500 million in 2010\u20132020. NWSDB\u2019s corporate plan (2012\u20132016) includes \ngoals of increasing water supply and sanitation coverage and improving business efficiency and \nservices to customers. The business efficiency objectives specifically target NRW reduction in \nColombo and nationally. \n \n9.  Investment program. The investment program will support the government in achieving \nits water supply and wastewater targets under the DPF for Greater Colombo. Supplementing \nongoing projects and expected funds from other development partners, such as JICA and \nNWSDB, Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing of $300 million under the MFF will provide \n100% of the investment needed to achieve the water supply targets ($164 million) and 85% of \nthe investment needed to achieve the wastewater targets ($136 million) for Colombo. The MFF, \ntherefore, will fund about 20% of the $1,500 million financing needed by the government under \nits investment plan for water and sanitation in Greater Colombo. Global best practice and \nproven approaches to NRW reduction will be used to reduce NRW, from the current 49% to \n20% in Colombo, and from about 60% to 18% in critical areas, by the end of the investment \nprogram in 2020. Wastewater will meet the discharge target set by the Central Environment \nAuthority.  \n \n10.  MFF and tranches. The MFF modality was selected to allow phased implementation \nand funding of individual projects when they are ready, subject to eligibility and readiness of \nsubprojects included in the investment program. The requirements for an MFF are in place. The \ngovernment has prepared a sector strategy supported by an investment plan for the next  \n8 years.12 The MFF will be sequenced: (i) tranche 1: $84 million for project 1 in 2012; (ii) tranche \n2: $80 million for project 2 in 2013; (iii) tranche 3: $100 million for project 3 in 2015; and (iv) \ntranche 4: $36 million for project 4 in 2016. Projects 1 and 2 will focus on reducing NRW and \nimproving water service efficiency in Colombo. Project 1 will be implemented from 2012 to 2016. \nProjects 3 and 4 will support improved wastewater services, including treatment, and expansion \nof service coverage in Greater Colombo. The government has asked ADB for assistance in \nexploring possibilities for cofinancing under the investment plan.  \n \n11.  ADB strategy. ADB is one of the major development partners13 involved in water supply \nand sanitation in Sri Lanka, providing eight loan projects for a total of about $521 million since \n1986.  Lessons 14  from  the  involvement  of  ADB  and  other  development  partners  were \nincorporated into the investment program design. The investment program is consistent with the \npriority  assigned  by  ADB  and  the  government  to  the  water  supply  and  other  municipal \n                                                \n11 Further details of the investment plan are provided in Schedule 1 of the Framework Financing Agreement \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12 Schedule 1 of the Framework Financing Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 Other contributors to NRW reduction in Colombo are JICA and NWSDB. \n14 These are extracted from various sources including: ADB. 2007.

The government has requested an MFF in an amount up to $300 million equivalent, or \n75% of the total investment program cost, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources and ordinary \ncapital resources (OCR) to help finance a part of the investment program (Table 2). The MFF \nwill  consist  of  four  tranches,  subject  to  the  government\u2019s  submission  of  related  periodic \nfinancing requests, execution of the related loan and project agreements for each tranche, and \nfulfillment  of  terms  and  conditions  and  undertakings  set  forth  in  the  framework  financing \nagreement (FFA). 18 \n \n19.  The government will contribute $100 million, or 25% of the total investment program cost \nto finance taxes and duties, resettlement costs, and part of the civil works and recurrent costs. It \nwill relend relevant portions of the loan proceeds to NWSDB on a 50% grant and 50% loan \nbasis for financing capital investment costs in the water subsector, and to CMC on a 82.5% \ngrant  and  17.5%  loan  basis  in  the  wastewater  subsector,  in  accordance  with  established \nprocedures.  These  arrangements  will  be  described  in  subsidiary  financing  agreements, \nsatisfactory to ADB, to be signed and effective before NWSDB and CMC can receive the loan \nproceeds and the counterpart funds. The government will assume the foreign exchange risk.  \n \n20.  The government has submitted the first periodic financing request19 in line with the \nproposed FFA. Project 1 is estimated to cost $112 million equivalent, including taxes and duties \nof $28 million equivalent to be financed by the government. The total project cost will cover civil \nworks,  equipment,  consulting  services,  and  capacity  building  activities,  as  well  as  project \nimplementation,  and  safeguard  monitoring.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  \n$70 million from ADB\u2019s OCR and $14 million equivalent from the Asian Development Fund (ADF) \nto finance part of the cost of project 1. The OCR loan will have a 26-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \n                                                \n17 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Framework Financing Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Periodic Financing Request for Project 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6   \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility,20 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year \n(the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan), and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n23.  Due diligence. Various preparatory steps, such as preparing the water supply master \nplan,24 and network GIS mapping and modeling in Colombo, will be completed by October 2012 \nwith support from JICA.25 The investment program will validate the GIS mapping and calibrate \nthe network model. Least-cost options were selected for all designs and measures.  \n \n24.  NRW reduction monitoring. In line with current global best practice, the investment \nprogram will engage a consulting team to manage, coordinate, and oversee all NRW reduction \nactivities in Colombo. Special provisions for NRW reduction will be developed and incorporated \ninto the NRW reduction civil works bidding documents to ensure achievement of specific targets. \nThe NRW specialist will ensure that funds are used efficiently and that RSC-WC and NWSDB \nreceive the most appropriate solutions from investment program contractors and consultants. In-\nhouse  capacity  will  be  developed  to  ensure  that  RSC-WC  and  NWSDB  can  continue  a \nsustained NRW program, through training and the setting up of a dedicated NRW facility. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n \n25.  The estimated financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the water supply improvement \nproject, including projects 1 and 2, is 6.25%; the net present value is $75 million at the weighted \naverage cost of capital (WACC) of 2.95%. The FIRR is higher than the WACC, indicating a \nreasonable financial return. The result is robust against downside risks, as assessed in the \nsensitivity analysis, with (i) capital costs increased by 20%, (ii) O&M costs increased by 20%, \n(iii) revenues reduced by 20%, and (iv) project implementation delayed by 1 year. The FIRR \nvaries from 4.32% to 5.54%; it is 2.12% when all risks are assumed to occur at the same time. \nThe most sensitive risk factor is a decrease in revenues, followed by capital cost overrun. \n                                                \n24 JICA is financing the master plan project. \n25 Network mapping of a part of the Colombo service area was done in the 1970s with support from the North \nAmerican Aerospace Defense Command, but has not been maintained or updated. More recently, GIS mapping \nwas set up in certain areas of Colombo where JICA has carried out network improvements. \n ", "8   \nCommunity participation approaches will be used to register users and establish consumer \nsocieties for better billing and collection controls. According to the current tariff schedule, with \nmoderate increases,26 average monthly water bills will account for about 2.5% of the mean \nmonthly income of low-income households, well below the 5% threshold generally considered \nas an affordable user charge. The water improvement project is financially viable and affordable \nto all, including poor households. \n \n26.  An economic analysis was conducted for projects 1 and 2 of the investment program. \nThe estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the combined projects is 16.9%; the \nnet present value is $44 million at the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. The EIRR is \nhigher than the economic opportunity cost of capital, indicating a sufficient economic return. The \nresult is robust against downside risks, including (i) capital cost overrun of 20%, (ii) O&M cost \noverrun of 20%, (iii) benefits reduced by 20%, and (iv) project implementation delayed by 1 \nyear. The EIRRs range from 13.4% to 16.6% in the sensitivity analysis; the EIRR is 10% when \nall risks are assumed to occur at the same time. Sensitivity analysis shows that EIRRs are \ngenerally  robust  to  the  downside  risks  and  are  most  sensitive  to  a  reduction  in  benefits. \nSatisfactory project benefits are considered attainable, as the large and growing population of \nGreater Colombo, including the floating population of 500,000, will benefit from expanded water \nsupply service coverage as a result of the water improvement project, which will provide about \n30 million cubic meters of water per year to enhance the water supply system. \n \nC.  Governance  \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, MWSD, and MLGPC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the FAM. Risk was assessed using a governance risk assessment \ntool. Given the risks identified, some of the mitigation measures incorporated in project design \nare to (i) establish a mechanism for regular voluntary disclosure of investment program-related \ninformation to citizens, (ii) develop and utilize e-procurement system, (iii) develop and update an \ninvestment program website to enhance transparency during implementation, and (iv) establish \na grievance redress mechanism to ensure quick and effective relief. The investment program \nwill increase the decentralization of NWSDB functions by delegating all functions related to \nGreater Colombo\u2019s water supply to the RSC-WC, including investment planning, construction, \nand O&M of water supply operations, as recommended under the ADB technical assistance.27 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social  \n28.  The investment program will improve water supply and sanitation services in poor and \nnon-poor areas of Greater Colombo, enabling equitable access. It will improve the participation \nof low-income communities in water conservation, especially women in the formation of water \nuser groups.28 Project 1 is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan \n(GAP)  prepared  for  project  1  outlines  specific  activities,  indicators,  and  targets  for \nmainstreaming  gender  equity  into  the  project  design,  including  physical  and  institutional \ncomponents related to water and sanitation services. The consultation and participation plan \n(CPP)  outlines  specific  outreach  activities  to  raise  awareness  and  ensure  the  meaningful \nparticipation  of  communities  and  stakeholders  in  the  project  area.  A  nongovernment \n                                                \n26 Assumed at 20% every 3 years. \n27 ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for Institutional Strengthening \nfor Decentralization of Service Delivery in the Water Sector. Manila (TA 7078-SRI).  \n28 NWSDB estimates that 11% of NRW is from underserved settlements.  ", "    9 \norganization will be recruited to form water user groups; assist in implementing the GAP and \nCPP; and implement a water, sanitation, and hygiene awareness campaign in the underserved \nsettlement.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  Social safeguards. Project 1 is classified under category B for involuntary resettlement \nand category C for indigenous peoples in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). A draft resettlement plan endorsed by the government was prepared and disclosed for \nproject 1 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement to address potential temporary \nincome losses within the project area during linear pipe rehabilitation works, including temporary \ndisruption of approximately 7,600 mobile vendors and hawkers for less than 7 days. Full road \nclosure is not anticipated and work in busy commercial areas will be done during nonbusiness \nhours (i.e., nighttime) to the extent possible. Counterpart funds are budgeted to compensate for \npotential income losses before displacement. NWSDB has implemented previous ADB projects \nand  is  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies;  however,  the  management  advisory  and \nsupervision consultants will provide additional capacity support to counterpart staff new to ADB \nprojects and to help manage and monitor resettlement impacts and social risks during the \ninvestment program. The project management unit (PMU) will provide social safeguard reports \nto ADB every 6 months. A resettlement framework was prepared to guide resettlement planning \nin future tranches. Considering the urban setting of the project and socioeconomic survey \nresults within the investment program area, no impacts on indigenous peoples are expected, \nand an indigenous peoples planning framework is not required. 29  \n \n30.  Environmental safeguards. Project 1 is classified under category B for environment. \nAn environmental assessment and review framework was prepared to guide the preparation of \nfuture tranches, and an initial environmental examination30 with an environmental management \nplan was prepared for project 1 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \ngovernment  laws.  The  draft  initial  environmental  examination  concludes  that  no  significant \nadverse impact is anticipated as a result of the water distribution network improvements, and \nthat net environmental benefits to Colombo\u2019s population will be positive and large as a result of \nthe increased reliability of water supply. It outlines a grievance redress mechanism to ensure \neasy and quick redress of any complaints or concerns during project implementation. The \nenvironmental  management  plan  provides  adequate  mitigation  measures  for  any  foreseen \nconstruction impact, including traffic management to ensure limited disruption to traffic flow and \naccess. Support from the management advisory and supervision consultants will ensure that the \nPMU has adequate capacity to manage any environmental impact during detailed design and \nconstruction. The PMU will provide ADB with a report on environmental issues every 6 months. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.31 The integrated benefits and impact of the \ninvestment program are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nGovernance   \n                                                \n29 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Initial Environmental Examination: Project 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nDifficulty selecting competent contractors with  The ADB Sri Lanka Resident Mission and the government will hold \nexperience in NRW reduction for the water  a business opportunity fair.

ASSURANCES \n32.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the investment program shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the FAM and loan documents. The government, MWSD, and MLGPC have given ADB certain \nundertakings for the MFF, which are set forth in the FFA. Specific covenants agreed by the \ngovernment, MWSD, and MLGPC with respect to individual tranches under the MFF are set \nforth in the loan and project agreements for the respective tranches. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n33.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount not exceeding $300,000,000 equivalent to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri \nLanka for the Greater Colombo Water and Wastewater Management Improvement Investment \nProgram, comprising \n(i)   loans from ADB's Special Funds resources, with interest and other terms to be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  applicable  policies  relating  to  Special \nFunds resources, subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph 21 of this report; \nand  \n(ii)   loans from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest and other terms to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility;  \nsubject to such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the framework financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n1 October 2012 ", "Appendix 1  11 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nPerformance Targets and Indicators  Data Sources and  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved urban  Residents, particularly women, and  Census data from social  Government \nenvironment and  especially the poor, in Colombo have  department   continues to \nquality of life for  better living conditions and more time    implement \nresidents of Greater  for productive activities because of 24-   institutional and \nColombo  hour continuous water supply (baseline:    financial reforms as \n50% in 2012; target: 100% in 2024)     per its commitment   \n     \nQuality of discharge of wastewater  Annual reports from   \nsecondary treatment improved (BOD5  CMC   \n150 mg/l in 2012 baseline to 100mg/l   \ntarget in 2024)   \n   \nWaterborne diseases drop below 1 per  Census data from \n1,000 people in Greater Colombo by  predefined hospitals in \n2024 (baseline: 2.2 per 1,000 in 2012)  CMC \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved water  Daily water supply increased in  NWSDB reports  NWSDB and CMC \nsupply and  low-pressure areaa in Colombo    follow the \nwastewater service  (baseline: 5 hours in 2012; target: 24    recommended \nand management in  hours by 2020)     strategy and plan of \nGreater Colombo      action for NRW \nCitywide NRW in Colombo reduced  NWSDB water balance  reduction and for \n(baseline: 49% citywide and 60% in  audit  wastewater service \ncritical area in 2012; target: 20% in    improvement \nColombo and 18% in critical area by     \n2020)    Risk \n    Ongoing and planned \nCoverage of sewer network increased  CMC annual reports  water supply \nincluding all BPL households (FHHs    projects, financed by \namong them) (baseline: 80% in 2012;  JICA and NWSDB, \ntarget: 100% in Colombo in 2020)  not successfully \nimplemented \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
