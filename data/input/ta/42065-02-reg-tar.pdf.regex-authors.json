INTRODUCTION \n1.  The rapid spread of the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis across much of emerging East \nAsia confirmed the need for greater regional economic cooperation. Following the crisis, \nEast Asia launched several initiatives to move regional cooperation forward, particularly for \nearly detection and management of financial and macroeconomic vulnerabilities. The finance \nministers of ASEAN+31 member countries undertook three key initiatives to promote regional \nfinancial cooperation: \n(i)  introduction  of  a  regional  economic  review  and  policy  dialogue  (ERPD) \nprocess;  \n(ii)  establishment of a regional reserve pooling arrangement\u2014the Chiang Mai \nInitiative (CMI); and \n(iii)  development  of  local  currency  bond  markets\u2014the  Asian  Bond  Markets \nInitiative. \n \n2.  The ERPD and the CMI were launched by the ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers\u2019 Meeting \n(AFMM+3) in May 2000. The Asian Bond Markets Initiative was launched in 2003.  \n \n3.  The CMI and the ERPD were created to play central roles in crisis prevention and \nmanagement.  The  CMI  was  designed  to  address  short-term  liquidity  problems  and  to \nsupplement existing international financial arrangements in the event of an emergency. \nInitially, the initiative involved an expanded ASEAN swap arrangement2 involving all ASEAN \nmembers, and a network of bilateral swap agreements and repurchase facilities among \nASEAN+3 members. At the AFMM+3 held in Istanbul in May 2005, the finance ministers \nagreed to integrate the ERPD with the CMI as part of efforts to transform the CMI into a \ncentrally  administered  facility.  Follow-up  agreements  to  explore  ways  to  strengthen \nsurveillance capacity were adopted subsequently.  \n \n4.  At the 2008 and 2009 AFMM+3 meetings, the finance ministers decided to expedite \nCMI multilateralization (CMIM). They agreed that funds available under the CMIM should be \nin the form of a self-managed reserve pooling arrangement, governed by a single contract, \nto reduce costly and wasteful duplication. Under the CMIM, funds to a particular member \ncountry are limited by the country\u2019s borrowing quota, with quotas allocated in favor of smaller \nand less-developed member countries. The CMIM was officially launched on 23 March 2010.  \n5.  The  institutional  mechanism  for  conducting  regional  surveillance  is  being \nstrengthened with the decision to establish an independent surveillance unit responsible for \nanalyzing economic developments, potential risks, and policy options; and overseeing CMIM \noperations. At the 2009 AFMM+3, the ministers agreed to establish such a unit and at the \n14th ASEAN Finance Ministers\u2019 Meeting (AFMM) in April 2010 in Nha Trang, Viet Nam, \nannounced that the unit\u2014the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO)\u2014would \nbe operating by early 2011. AMRO will be established in Singapore by the ministries of \nfinance, central banks, and monetary authorities of ASEAN countries, the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (including Hong Kong, China), Japan, and the Republic of Korea. \n                                                 \n1  ASEAN+3 comprises the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Brunei Darussalam, \nCambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, \nThailand, and Viet Nam) plus the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. \n2  Central banks and monetary authorities of the original five ASEAN members (Indonesia, Malaysia, the \nPhilippines, Singapore, and Thailand) agreed to establish reciprocal currency or swap arrangements in August \n1977. The ASEAN swap arrangement was created primarily to provide liquidity support for those experiencing \nbalance-of-payments difficulties. The duration, coverage, and amount of the arrangement have expanded \nmarkedly since its inception. Originally intended to be in effect for just 1 year, the arrangement has been \nextended incrementally. The CMI expanded the arrangement to all current ASEAN members. \n \n ", "2  \n6.  The ASEAN+3 CMIM working group has asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto support establishment of AMRO to implement the CMIM, and to provide, jointly with the \nASEAN Secretariat, interim surveillance arrangements while this unit is being set up. The \ntechnical assistance (TA) was conceptualized in response to that request.  \n \n7.  The TA will help strengthen regional surveillance capacity for ASEAN+3, and thereby \ncontribute to the ASEAN+3\u2019s strategic objective of promoting macroeconomic and financial \nstability in the region.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n8.  ADB\u2019s support for regional surveillance dates back to 1998, following the creation of \nthe ASEAN Surveillance Process (ASP). Based on the principles of peer review and mutual \ninterest among ASEAN members, the overall purpose of the ASP is to strengthen policy-\nmaking capacity within the ASEAN grouping. It is the first concrete attempt by a group of \ndeveloping countries to exchange information on economic developments and policies, and \nto  consider  individual  and  collective  responses  to  events  that  could  negatively  impact \nsubregional economic well-being. In addition to the usual monitoring of exchange rates and \nmacroeconomic  aggregates,  the  ASP  monitors  sector  and  social  policies.  The  ASEAN \nfinance ministers meet twice a year for policy coordination under the ASP.  \n9.  In the terms of understanding on the establishment of the ASP (4 October 1998), \nASEAN finance ministers specifically asked ADB to take the lead in providing training and \ncapacity-building assistance to the ASEAN Secretariat and relevant staff in the finance \nministries,  central  banks,  and  other  relevant  departments  of  ASEAN  members.  In  this \nconnection, ADB has provided support to the ASP by (i) contracting full-time international \nconsultants to support surveillance work by the ASEAN Secretariat; (ii) helping establish \nnational surveillance units in six ASEAN countries; (iii) developing and installing the early \nwarning  system  software  in  these  countries  to  facilitate  the  detection  of  emerging \nvulnerabilities; and (iv) conducting training programs on regional economic and financial \nmonitoring.  \n10.  Apart from its support to the ASP, ADB has been directly involved in supporting and \ncontributing to the ERPD process. At present, economic surveillance through the ERPD is \ncarried out in two stages. The first stage is conducted at the ASEAN+3 Finance and Central \nBank Deputies\u2019 Meeting (AFDM+3), held biannually in April and November. The AFDM+3 is \nan unofficial forum that lasts a day and a half. The ERPD session, which typically lasts about \nhalf a day, begins with presentations by ADB and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on \nglobal  and  regional  economic  outlooks.3 Outside  experts  are  invited  to  participate  and \ndiscuss  emerging  or  urgent  issues  as  the  need  arises.  Participating  countries  prepare \nsurveillance reports by following predetermined templates. All surveillance reports and the \nminutes of discussions are kept confidential. The second stage of the review is conducted at \nthe AFMM+3, held once a year concurrent with the ADB annual meeting. This stage of the \nreview focuses more on issues related to policy. The ADB President takes part in the \ndiscussions and discusses regional economic developments and policy issues with the \nministers.  \n11.  The  AFDM+3  surveillance  stage  includes  a  peer  review,  allowing  participating \ncountries the opportunity to exchange views and discuss corrective policies. In practice, \n                                                 \n3 Representatives from the IMF were invited to the AFDM+3 beginning in November 2005. A key surveillance \noutput that ADB contributes is a confidential note presented at the AFDM+3 on economic prospects and policy \nissues for ASEAN+3. One by-product of this work is the Asia Economic Monitor, which the Office of Regional \nEconomic Integration publishes twice a year and posts on the Asian Regional Integration Center website \n<http://aric.adb.org>. The ASEAN+3 governments use these background reports when conducting regional \neconomic and financial monitoring and peer review. \n ", "  3\nhowever, the deputies typically refrain from assessing the economic developments and \npolicies of other countries and in recommending scope for policy adjustment. As such, the \nERPD largely remains a mechanism for exchanging information on economic developments \nand policies.4 The lack of a permanent secretariat has limited its usefulness at this stage. \n12.  Implementation  of  the  CMIM  will  require  improvements  in  the  mechanism  and \nprocesses of regional surveillance. In a multilateral setting, monitoring and surveillance need \nto be enhanced to include national policies as well as regional and global issues that can \naffect external stability and borrowing countries\u2019 capacity to meet repayment conditions of \nlending countries. Unconditional financing when policy correction is needed could create \nmoral hazard, both for potential borrowers and international investors, even when it does not \nadversely affect the prospect for timely repayment. The appropriate combination of financing \nand adjustment can be identified in a lending program only through surveillance. The CMIM \nmust be empowered to rely more on its own assessment to make lending decisions\u2014\nincluding the amount and any conditionality\u2014without creating moral hazard or the concern \nthat the problems leading to balance-of-payments difficulties may be fundamental in nature. \nThis requires enhancing the scope and methodology of existing assessments, and improving \nthe institutional mechanism for surveillance.  \n13.  Regional  surveillance  by  AMRO  can  help  fill  gaps  in  the  existing  surveillance \nmechanisms and processes. Although the IMF has started to do some regional surveillance, \nthe main focus remains on global and national perspectives. Regional surveillance needs to \nbe strengthened to complement bilateral and multilateral efforts. In this context, a regional \nsurveillance mechanism, implemented by an independent regional surveillance unit such as \nAMRO, can add value through its evaluation mechanism. That is, benefits could result from \nshifting  from  a  \u201ctop\u2013down\u201d  to  a  \u201cbottom\u2013up\u201d  approach  to  regional  surveillance,  with  a \nregional institution playing the central role. This would ensure that stronger channels of \ncommunication  run  not  just  \"top\u2013down\"  from  global  analysis  to  national  and  regional \npolicymakers but also \"bottom\u2013up\"\u2014drawing on national and regional monitoring to global \nsurveillance and dialogue processes. AMRO, however, should not be seen as a substitute \nfor the IMF. It is designed to enhance objective economic monitoring, supplementing the IMF, \nespecially given the IMF's short-term liquidity facility, which enables certain countries to \nborrow without conditions.5 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.   Impact and Outcome \n14.  The TA will help strengthen regional surveillance capacity for ASEAN+3 and the \nCMIM (impact), by supporting the creation of AMRO, an independent regional surveillance \nunit in charge of all surveillance activities (outcome). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will consist of four components: \n \n                                                 \n4  T. Murase. 2007.

Basel: Bank for International Settlements. \n5  Under the CMIM, a country can draw up to 20% of its quota without being subject to IMF conditionality, \nalthough the term is restricted to no more than 6 months. Should a country avail of its full quota, then 80% of \nthe amount disbursed would be tied to an IMF program. Once the regional surveillance unit is fully operating, \nthe amount that member countries can withdraw without IMF conditionality could be increased.  \n ", "4  \n(i)  Support for preparatory work. To help with the early organizational set-up \nof  AMRO,  two  international  consultants\u2014one  administrative  and  one \ntechnical\u2014will  be  recruited.  The  administrative  consultant  will  undertake \npreparatory work related to establishing AMRO, while the technical consultant \nwill  undertake  preparatory  work  related  to  institutionalizing  the  regional \nsurveillance process. This will include reviewing existing surveillance activities \nto  determine  data  gaps  and  identify  possible  data  access  and  sharing \narrangements involving AMRO, ADB and other multilateral agencies, and \nASEAN+3 members. \n(ii)  Formal training of surveillance staff. Once the surveillance team is in place, \ntraining on regional economic and financial monitoring will be provided to \nenhance capacity in assessing macroeconomic and financial vulnerabilities. \nThis  will  include  hands-on  training  on  developing  database  systems, \npreparing  surveillance  reports,  and  conducting  peer  reviews  and  due \ndiligence; participation in short courses in recognized training institutions or \nuniversities;  and  participation  in  relevant  regional  policy  seminars  and \nworkshops. \n(iii)  Support for surveillance and project administration operations. To help \nAMRO  in  the  actual  implementation  of  surveillance  functions,  two \ninternational consultants\u2014one macroeconomist or capital markets specialist, \nand  one  economics  statistician\u2014will  be  based  in-house  at  AMRO.  The \ninternational consultants will help prepare surveillance reports, provide on-\nthe-job-training, and extend guidance on the conduct of peer reviews and due \ndiligence. A third international consultant will provide support for AMRO\u2019s \npublic  relations  function.  A  national  consultant  based  in  ADB\u2019s  Office  of \nRegional  Economic  Integration  (OREI)  will  help  with  overall  project \nadministration and provide technical and analytical support, as needed. \n(iv)  Information technology support. A small budget will be made available to \nthe surveillance unit to address information technology requirements related \nto the development of surveillance databases and leading indicator systems. \n \n16.  Once  AMRO  begins  operating  at  full  capacity,  a  subsequent  phase  could  be \nimplemented to address AMRO\u2019s evolving research and capacity development needs. Any \nsuch assistance will be designed and prepared in close consultation with AMRO. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,140,000 equivalent, to be financed on a grant basis \nby the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund6 under the Regional Cooperation and Integration \nFinancing  Partnership  Facility,  and  administered  by  ADB.  The  financing  will  cover  the \nremuneration and travel expenses of international and national consultants, training for \nAMRO staff, information technology support, and other miscellaneous expenses. The cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The CMIM working group will initially be responsible for implementing the TA, with \nAMRO assuming responsibility once the office is established. ADB will be the executing \nagency for the TA. TA activities are expected to commence in May 2011, and be completed \nby May 2013.  \n \n19.  The TA will require (i) two international consultants (3 person-months each) to help \nwith the early organizational set-up of AMRO; (ii) two international consultants to be based \n                                                 \n6  Established by the Government of Japan. \n ", "  5\nin-house  at  AMRO  (12  person-months  each)  to  provide  operating  support  to  AMRO\u2019s \nsurveillance functions; (iii) one international consultant (6 person-months) to provide support \nfor  AMRO\u2019s  public  relations  function;  and  (iv)  a  national  consultant  based  in  OREI \n(12 person-months) to provide project management support at ADB. The consultants will \nrespond to the division of responsibilities as specified in the terms of reference (Appendix 3). \nGiven the high expertise and specificity of skills required by these positions, the consultants \nwill be recruited individually, in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n20.  A small budget will be made available to the surveillance unit to address information \ntechnology requirements related to the development of surveillance databases and leading \nindicator  systems,  which  will  include  the  purchase  of  computers  and  software.  Such \npurchases  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as \namended from time to time) and will be turned over to AMRO upon TA completion.  \n \n21.  The  Government  of  Singapore  will  provide  in-kind  support  in  the  form  of  office \naccommodation and equipment. \n \n22.  Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with the ADB Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,140,000  to  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund under the Regional \nCooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility, for Supporting and Enhancing \nRegional Surveillance for ASEAN+3 and the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms   Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nStrengthen regional  Establishment of an  Meetings of ASEAN+3  Continued \nsurveillance capacity  independent regional  finance ministers and  commitment of \nfor ASEAN+3 and the  surveillance mechanism for  deputy ministers   ASEAN+3 leaders  \nChiang Mai Initiative  East Asia  \nSurveillance monitoring  Risk \nmultilateralization \nreports  \nMember countries\u2019 \n \ncommitment to \nsurveillance process \nweakens  \nOutcomes      Assumption \nCreation of an  Establishment of an  Midterm and final  ASEAN+3 members \nindependent regional  independent regional  reviews   reach an agreement \nsurveillance unit in  surveillance mechanism  and commit to the \ncharge of all  governance structure \nInstitutionalization of peer \nsurveillance activities   and cost-sharing \nreview and due diligence \narrangement for \nprocesses   \nsustaining AMRO  \nRisk \nMember countries\u2019 \ncommitment to the \nsurveillance process \nweakens  \nOutputs       Assumption \n1.
