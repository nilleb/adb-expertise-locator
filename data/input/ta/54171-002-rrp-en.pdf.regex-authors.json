THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of the Philippines for the Health System Enhancement to Address and Limit COVID-\n19 (HEAL). \n   \n2.  As part of the comprehensive support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the \nGovernment of the Philippines in responding to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), HEAL will \nassist the Department of Health (DOH) in scaling up public health capacity to manage the \npandemic. It will provide medical equipment and supplies and upgrade laboratories and isolation \nfacilities at 17 DOH hospitals throughout the country. This will strengthen COVID-19-related \ntesting, surveillance, infection prevention and control, and treatment. It will also help to improve \nthe preparedness and resilience of the health system to handle future public health threats. HEAL \nwill support three operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030\u2014addressing remaining poverty \nand  reducing  inequalities,  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality,  and  strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity. The outcome of HEAL will be the strengthened capacity of \nDOH to detect, contain, and treat COVID-19 cases. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  State of public health emergency. On 8 March 2020, the government declared a state \nof public health emergency.1 New infections rapidly grew and spread from the National Capital \nRegion (NCR) to the rest of Luzon and other parts of the country. The government raised the \nCOVID-19 Alert System to Code Red sublevel 2 on 13 March 2020 and imposed a month-long \ncommunity  quarantine  in  the  NCR.  This  was  later  expanded  to  an  enhanced  community \nquarantine (ECQ) for the entire island of Luzon, and several areas in the Visayas and Mindanao. \nOn 15 May 2020, the NCR, Laguna, and the cities of Cebu and Mandaue were placed under \nmodified ECQ until 31 May 2020. By 1 June 2020, most places either moved into general \ncommunity quarantine if the daily reported number of new cases were decreasing or were \nrequired to implement minimum health standards if no new cases had been reported in the \npreceding two weeks. However, due to a spike in the number of cases, modified ECQ was re-\nintroduced in the NCR, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal from 4 to 18 August 2020. The \nPhilippines had registered 129,913 confirmed cases (including 239 serious or critical ones and \n67,673 recoveries) and 2,270 deaths out of 1,769,881 tests conducted (Figure).2  \nCumulative and Daily Confirmed Coronavirus Disease Cases in the Philippines \n \n           \nSource: Worldometer.

The government announced the guiding principles of minimum health standards in the \nhealth and other sectors\u2014the \u201cnew normal\u201d\u2014aiming to prevent the spread of COVID-19 cases \nafter all quarantine measures are lifted. The imposition of the ECQ, modified ECQ, and general \ncommunity  quarantine  is  expected  to  prevent  wider  community  transmission  and  avoid \noverwhelming the health system. Recent studies confirm that without quarantine measures, the \ncountry\u2019s hospital system would have been overwhelmed by more than 1 million people needing \nhospitalization.3  \n \n5.  Strained health system. The growing number of COVID-19 cases poses a serious threat \nto the country\u2019s health system, which had long neglected laboratory and diagnostic services and \ninvestments in human resource capacity. Delays in COVID-19 testing, long turn-around time from \nsampling to obtaining results (para. 6), inadequate infection control such as the lack of personal \nprotective equipment (PPE) in hospitals, overcrowded emergency rooms, insufficient number of \nhospital and critical care beds, and an increasing number of health professionals getting infected \nand dying from COVID-19 further constrain the health system.  \n \n6.  Insufficient testing and surveillance capacity. In early March 2020, the Research \nInstitute for Tropical Medicine was the only laboratory conducting polymerase chain reaction \n(PCR) testing for COVID-19 for the whole country. This limited testing capacity, combined with \nfragmented contact tracing, made it difficult to centrally monitor and ensure the application of \ncontrol measures by local government units (LGUs), such as the isolation of probable and suspect \ncases. LGUs are also constrained by inadequate human and financial resources, and lack of \nadequate DOH support for contact tracing and the setup of local isolation wards.  \n \n7.  Inadequate  infection  control  measures.  COVID-19  has  resulted  in  widespread \nnosocomial infections.4 This highlights the urgent need to isolate suspect cases, even with mild \nsymptoms, and ensure enough supply of PPE for health care workers.5 The increased demand \nfor PPE follows the national treatment and infection protocols of suspect and confirmed cases, \nand about 30 sets of disposable PPE per day per health worker are required.6 Both government \nand private hospitals face a shortage of PPE, which increases the vulnerability of health care \nstaff. The inadequate number of isolation and/or negative pressure rooms in hospitals and the \nlack of isolation facilities for suspect and mild COVID-19 cases exacerbate the situation.7 Only \nlarge private and government hospitals have negative pressure rooms at present.8  \n \n8.  Low treatment capacity for moderate and severe cases. The low ratios of hospital beds \nto population (1 hospital bed per 984 people) and doctors to population (about 1 doctor per 2,000 \npeople), and the lack of critical care beds and ventilators also constrain the ability of the health \nsystem to treat the growing number of COVID-19 cases in the country. It is globally estimated that \n30% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients will require critical care, including invasive mechanical \nventilation.9 The number of ventilators available nationwide (about 2,000) is inadequate to treat \nthe increasing number of severe COVID-19 cases. The number of health care workers trained in \n \n3 M. Herrera et al. 2020. Evaluating Potential Consequences of Alternative Public Responses to the Covid-19 Epidemic \nin the Philippines.

In \naddition, providing critical care services may be compromised by inadequate financing and \ndelayed reimbursements of COVID-19 patients\u2019 medical and hospital costs by the Philippine \nHealth Insurance Corporation (PHIC).10 \n \n9.  Epidemiological studies predict that COVID-19 will persist over a span of 18 to 24 months \nwith periodical surges unless an effective treatment or a vaccine is made available (footnote 3). \nA large investment in testing, tracing, and constructing isolation facilities is needed to meet the \ntargeted testing of 75,000 cases per day and contact tracing of at least 50,000 individuals by the \nend of 2020.11 This requires increasing the health system\u2019s capacity to address the short-, \nmedium-, and long-term needs triggered by COVID-19 (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Health System Needs \nHealth System Constraints  Short-Term Needs  Medium- to Long-Term Needs \nInsufficient testing and  Rapidly scale up actual  \u2022  Sustain at least 30,000 actual tests a day \nsurveillance capacity  testing to at least 30,000  \u2022  Reach up to 75,000 people per day for testing and \ntests a day  trace at least 50,000 individuals by December \n2020 \n\u2022  Improve contact tracing by LGUs \n\u2022  Expand number of local level isolation facilities \nInadequate infection control  Ensure adequate supply of  \u2022  Increase  available  negative  pressure  isolation \nmeasures  PPE to all health workers  rooms in hospitals \nLow treatment capacity for  Increase availability of  \u2022  Ensure sustained functioning of the critical care \nmoderate and severe  critical care beds equipped  equipment \nCOVID-19 cases  with ventilators and other  \u2022  Ensure timely PHIC payment of covered COVID-\nneeded equipment  19 services \nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, LGU = local government unit, PHIC = Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, PPE \n= personal protective equipment. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n10.  Government\u2019s response. In early March 2020, the government declared a state of public \nemergency and imposed area-specific quarantine measures to restrain the spread of COVID-19 \n(para. 4). To mitigate the harsh social and economic impacts of the severe measures, the \ngovernment enacted the Bayan Bayanihan to Heal as One Act on 24 March 2020, which provides \npolicies to speed up the response actions laid out in the National Action Plan for COVID-19.12 The \nlaw mandates expedited procurement and delivery of emergency medical supplies and equipment \nfor health facilities that will enable the government to test, trace, isolate, and treat COVID-19 \ncases. This effort is led by the Department of National Defense and the Department of Interior \nand Local Government, with DOH providing technical guidance.  \n \n11.  Test, trace, isolate, and treat. Given the increased number of confirmed COVID-19 \ncases (para. 3), DOH took steps to further increase testing capacity and contact tracing. It boosted \nthe number of government PCR laboratories from 1 to 19, which includes 2 university laboratories, \n1  LGU  public  laboratory,  and  1  Department  of  Agriculture  laboratory.  ADB  supported  the \nconvening of the public\u2013private Task Force T3 (Test, Trace, and Treat) to mobilize the private \nsector to help increase the testing capacity of government laboratories, upgrade the capacities of \nprivate laboratories, and set up new private laboratories, particularly outside the major urban \ncenters; and improve inventory and logistics management.

National Action Plan for COVID-19 in the Philippines. Manila. \n ", "4 \nPacific Disaster Response Fund, ADB and DOH established a modern subnational pandemic \nreference laboratory at Jose B. Lingad Regional Memorial Hospital (JBL Hospital), increasing the \ncountry\u2019s  testing  capacity  by  3,000  tests  per  day.13  As  of  25  July  2020,  40  private  PCR \nlaboratories have been certified to supplement the government PCR laboratories, bringing the \ncombined total of government and private PCR laboratories to 70. An additional 23 GeneXpert \nlaboratories have also been certified. These have increased daily testing to an average of around \n26,000 in the week of 19\u201325 July 2020. A further increase to over 30,000 tests a day is expected \nby end-August 2020, as the government expands the coverage of testing from symptomatic \npatients and frontliners to residents of hotspot barangays.  \n \n12.  The challenge now lies in sustaining this level of testing by ensuring a sufficient number \nof trained laboratory personnel, PCR test kits, PPE, and other supplies. The government procured \nand distributed at least 900,000 sets of PPE across the country. PHIC expanded the benefit \ncoverage of all COVID-19 patients and health workers to also include PCR testing. In addition, \nDOH is providing additional benefits such as special risk allowance, cash compensation for \nsevere  COVID-19  infection,  and  expanded  death  benefits  for  health  workers.  The  country \ncurrently has 22 government hospitals, including the university hospital of the state-run University \nof the Philippines (Philippine General Hospital) and one private hospital, designated as COVID-\n19 referral hospitals. Several convention centers, stadiums, and other public facilities are also \nbeing converted into temporary health facilities to isolate suspect and mild COVID-19 cases.  \n \n13.  Development partners\u2019 coordination. Following the World Health Organization (WHO) \nStrategic Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19, the Philippines adopted a whole-of-\nsociety  coordination  mechanism.  DOH\u2019s  Emergency  Operating  Center  leads  the  national \ncontingency planning process, involving all relevant government agencies, the private sector, and \nnongovernment  organizations  such  as  the  Philippine  Red  Cross.  WHO  supports  DOH  in \ncoordinating with development partners such as ADB, the World Bank, the United States Agency \nfor International Development, and other United Nations technical agencies. With the proposed \ninvestment loan ADB will support DOH in the provision of medical equipment and supplies, and \nthe upgrade of laboratories and isolation facilities at DOH hospitals in different locations. The \nWorld Bank is also providing an investment project loan to support the scaling up of DOH\u2019s health \nresponse  ADB  will  establish  a  joint  reporting  mechanism  with  the  World  Bank  to  ensure \ncomplementarity and reduce the transaction costs for DOH.14 \n \n14.  Government request. The government estimates that an immediate medical response to \nCOVID-19 will cost about $708 million (\u20b135 billion equivalent).15 The National Action Plan for \nCOVID-19 represents a full-scale, whole-of-government response aimed at increasing the testing \nand  tracing  capacity  and  halting  community  transmission.  Recognizing  how  long-standing \nweaknesses in health service delivery, financing, and governance capacities have affected its \nability to contain COVID-19, DOH aims to invest in improving health infrastructure and equipment, \nenhancing health human resources, and strengthening health financing and information systems. \nThese investments will support the country\u2019s COVID-19 response, help it achieve universal health \ncoverage, and prepare it for future public health security threats. The government requested ADB \nto provide a dedicated health sector investment loan to accelerate the implementation of the \nhealth service delivery component of the National Action Plan for COVID-19 (footnote 12).  \n \n13 ADB. 2020.

The project \nwill  train  technicians  and  other  staff  on  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  to  ensure  the \nsustainability of the ventilators and other critical care equipment. It will also train health workers \nto detect and prevent domestic gender-based violence, and provide psycho-social support to \npatients and families, including pregnant and vulnerable women affected by COVID-19.  \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n19.  ADB helped the government to strengthen primary health care services through the \nWomen\u2019s Health and Safe Motherhood Project in 1994\u20132002 and the Integrated Community \nHealth Project in 1995\u20132005.21 In 2004, the Health Sector Development Program was approved \nto support the implementation of the 1999 Health Sector Reform Agenda.22 In 2009, ADB \napproved the Credit for Better Health Care Project to help upgrade health services of LGUs and \nfacilitate private sector participation in health care.23 The key lessons from these interventions are \nthat health project designs need to (i) take into account the decentralized health system and its \ninstitutional  arrangements  for  local  health  service  delivery;  and  (ii)  include  public  financial \nmanagement support to strengthen project implementation, performance, and governance.  \n20.  HEAL will provide targeted support to the health sector. It complements the recently \napproved $1.5 billion COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program,24 which \nhelps the government finance its fiscal response to COVID-19, including emergency cash grants \nto 18 million low income households and wage subsidies to employees of small businesses. It \nalso  complements  the  $200  million  Social  Protection  Support  Project  (Second  Additional \nFinancing), which provided more than 3.7 million poor households under the Pantawid Pamilyang \nPilipino Program with emergency cash assistance to help them cope with the loss of livelihood \nbecause of the quarantine.25 The model of the subnational pandemic reference laboratory \nestablished at JBL Hospital with the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund grant (para. 11 and \nfootnote 13) will be replicated when constructing and equipping the two new BSL-2 laboratories \nunder output 1. HEAL, together with the support of the laboratory establishment, is the start of the \nlonger-term engagement to support DOH for rolling out the Universal Health Care reform. \n \n21.  In close partnership with development partners, research institutions, and the private \nsector, ADB will continue to support knowledge generation on epidemiological modeling, research \nand development, and technology-enabled solutions to help DOH refine and update its COVID-\n19 management strategy and interventions. For instance, ADB conducted a cost\u2013benefit analysis \nof COVID-19 control options post ECQ jointly with national and overseas research institutions. \nThe study recommended a stronger policy for testing, contact tracing, and isolation, combined \nwith the application of minimum health standards, for a sustainable economic recovery process \n(footnote 11).

ADB\u2019s assistance \nto the poor also included a rapid response technical assistance grant for $5 million, which leveraged private sector \ndonations to provide food baskets to up to 140,000 vulnerable families affected by COVID-19 in the NCR. \n ", "7 \n22.  ADB will provide technical support to strengthen the health system reforms under the \nUniversal Health Care Act.26 The support aims to (i) upgrade the health information system with \napplication and support regulatory frameworks to sustain private sector engagement in diagnosis, \ncontact tracing, and equipment purchase; (ii) develop business processes and an information \nsystem for PHIC to strengthen its organizational capacity; and (iii) develop the Philippines Health \nFacility Development Plan to strengthen health facilities\u2019 capacities in line with the country\u2019s \nUniversal Health Care goals.27 ADB, through the Task Force T3 (para. 11), will continue to support \nthe expansion of testing and contact tracing, and the local production of PPE. ADB is also \nsupporting DOH to strengthen communication systems to manage COVID-19. The activities will \ncomplement HEAL in strengthening the health system in the long term. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n23.  HEAL is estimated to cost $131 million, including taxes and duties, physical and price \ncontingencies,  administrative  costs,  and  interest  charges  during  implementation  (Table  2). \nDetailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier are included in the project \nadministration manual  (PAM).28  ADB  will  finance  goods,  civil  works,  equipment,  consulting \nservices, taxes, and duties.  \n \nTable 2: Summary Cost Estimates \nAmount   Share of Total  \nItem  Description    ($ million)a  (% ) \nA.

Implementation Arrangements  \n \n26.  DOH will be the executing agency and the implementing agency. It will set up a Project \nManagement Team (PMT) that will manage, coordinate, and monitor performance according to \nthe design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). The 17 selected DOH hospitals will provide \nadequate  space  and  qualified  human  resources  to  operate  the  medical  equipment  in  the \nconstructed laboratories and isolation wards and rooms. DOH will engage a technical support unit \ncomprising individual consultants (health experts, an architect, engineers, a gender specialist, \nenvironmental  safeguards  specialists,  a  financial  management  specialist,  a  procurement \nspecialist, and administration staff) to assist the PMT.  \n \n27.  Given the urgency to receive the required goods, the current volatile global supply for \nCOVID-19 medical equipment and consumables, and DOH\u2019s constrained human resources, DOH \nwill engage a procurement agent to support the procurement of all medical equipment and goods \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s procurement policy. The contracting of a procurement agent will allow \nfor cost savings through order consolidation, leading to economies of scale, and reduces the risks \nrelated to product quality, availability, and logistics. Furthermore, leveraging the capacity and \nexpertise of the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) ensures value for money. \nDOH  requested that the  recruitment  of  UNOPS  be  delegated  to  ADB,  while  DOH  will  be \nresponsible for contract negotiation, signing, and management. \n \n28.  Based on its procurement knowledge, capacity, and proven experience in rapidly sourcing \nand supplying medical equipment and goods through its Asia Regional Health Cluster, UNOPS \nwill be engaged through direct contracting. UNOPS has solid expertise in the health sector, \nespecially in undertaking global procurement and overseeing the construction of hospitals and \nhealth centers, with extensive experience in Asia. In the Philippines, UNOPS is currently building \na hospital in the province of Leyte (Eastern Visayas region), giving it the necessary knowledge \nand understanding of the procurement required in similar medical facilities in the country. UNOPS \nhas  long-term  agreements  in  place  for  medical  equipment  and  vehicles,  and  preexisting \nrelationships  with  other  quality  medical  goods  suppliers.  Its  database  of  prequalified \nmanufacturers and suppliers, as well as pricing references for pharmaceutical and medical \nequipment purchased in the region ensure cost-effectiveness and provide UNOPS with a global \nprocurement reach and up-to-date market knowledge of COVID-19 procurement constraints.   \n \n29.  As regards the civil works at selected hospitals, their grouping into three packages \ncovering Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, with individual lots through open competitive bidding \n(national advertisement), will provide procurement flexibility and allow work to be undertaken in \nparallel. As project activities are related to the COVID-19 response, universal procurement will \n ", "9 \napply (footnote 18).

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Viability29  \n \n30.  ADB estimates that the Philippines\u2019 gross domestic product (GDP) will contract between \n2.3% and 5.3% in 2020 because of a significant fall in household spending and investment, down \nfrom an originally projected GDP growth of 6.2% for 2020.30 In the short run, a health system \noverwhelmed by COVID-19 will have debilitating effects on human capital because of additional \ndeaths and increased morbidities. HEAL is expected to augment the government\u2019s response to \nthe COVID-19 pandemic by upgrading surveillance and diagnostic capacity, improving prevention \nand control measures, and boosting treatment capacity. Cost\u2013benefit analyses on various post-\nECQ scenarios show that the least costly measure is massive investment in tracing, testing, and \nisolation capacities (footnote 11). A cost-effectiveness analysis of HEAL, following ADB guidelines \non economic analyses, shows that the cost per disability-adjusted life years is below the GDP per \ncapita, making the intervention very cost-effective.31  \n \nB.  Sustainability  \n \n31.  While HEAL will have a high development impact, it is not a revenue generating project. \nThe financial analysis included an assessment of DOH\u2019s capacity to pay for its total recurrent \n \n29 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 ADB. 2020.

WHO. 2016. Cost Effectiveness Thresholds: Pros and Cons. Geneva. \n ", "10 \ncosts, including the required incremental O&M expenditures for HEAL. DOH largely depends on \nthe national budget for funding. An overall shortfall in DOH's internal budget allocation for O&M \nis expected. This risk will be mitigated by the ability of government hospitals to generate revenues \nto cover the additional O&M cost. These hospitals enjoy fiscal autonomy, which allows them to \nretain 100% of revenues generated for the improvement of health care services. This is on top of \nthe budgetary allocation they receive from the National Treasury and subsidies from DOH in the \nevent of shortfalls. Further, government hospitals, including DOH hospitals, supplement their \nbudgetary allocations with reimbursements from PHIC. With PHIC\u2019s expanded coverage for \nCOVID-19 testing, community quarantine, and in-patient care, these reimbursements will provide \nadditional financing for the hospitals. To further mitigate the risk, the loan agreement will include \na provision to ensure that DOH allocates sufficient budget and resources for O&M. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n32.  DOH has adequate financial management systems in place, including internal audits and \na fully automated financial information system. Financial reporting is done on a regular basis. \nAccounting and auditing standards are in line with international standards. Nonetheless, ADB \nnoted some significant weaknesses. First, in its frontline role of handling the health crisis, DOH \nmay not be able to manage large-scale procurement of goods and works and mobilize adequate \nstaff to implement the project. Second, of the total authorized staff positions in DOH, 24% have \nnot been filled. Third, DOH has weak financial management capacity as evidenced by material \nmisstatements and deficiencies in its financial reports. Finally, the internal control is weak \nbecause of the lack of an orderly storage system with adequate controls to safekeep procured \nmaterials. The financial management risk of HEAL was therefore considered to be substantial. \nThe procurement risk of HEAL was assessed as high. DOH has limited experience in undertaking \nprocurement  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policies  and  Regulations.  Compounding  these \nconstraints, DOH is understaffed with existing staff resources extremely stretched by DOH\u2019s \nfrontline role in the COVID-19 response. To mitigate this, DOH will (i) engage a procurement \nagent (para. 27) and implementation consultants such as a national financial management \nspecialist and a procurement specialist as part of the technical support unit (para. 26) to support \nit; (ii) identify full-time focal persons within DOH and at the 17 selected subnational hospitals, who \nwill oversee the implementation; (iii) conduct quarterly monitoring; and (iv) establish and roll out \nfinancial management arrangements through briefings and training.  \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and DOH. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 28). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  Poverty and social. The government has made significant progress in reducing poverty \nfrom 23.3% of the population in 2015 to 16.6% in 2018, thanks to strong wage employment \ncreation and sustained economic growth averaging 6.3% annually from 2011 to 2019. However, \nthe COVID-19-related shocks and ECQ measures to contain the spread of the virus have resulted \nin job losses and a reduction in household incomes, including remittances from overseas, which \nwill increase the incidence of poverty in 2020 and threaten to reverse the gains achieved in \npoverty alleviation. ADB estimates that unemployment in Luzon which may have peaked at 22% \nin June of 2020 could gradually decline to 9.6% by the first quarter of 2021, well above the pre-\nCOVID-19 rate of 5.4% at the end of 2019. Similarly, the incidence of poverty could increase from \n16.6% in 2018 to 20.7% in 2020. This equates to 5.5 million more Filipinos falling into poverty \n(footnote 24). Community quarantine was aimed at slowing the spread of the virus, giving the \n ", "11 \ngovernment time to institute critical measures to step up public health security and health \nsystems, while protecting the most vulnerable people such as young children, people with pre-\nexisting conditions, and the elderly. Such measures, however, also tend to disrupt economic \nactivities, which heavily affects the informal sector and the daily wage earners. Other anticipated \nconsequences are negative coping behaviors that lead to domestic and gender-based violence.  \n \n35.  Gender. HEAL is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. Women account for 75% \nof health workers in the Philippines. Key gender issues in the present context include (i) limited \navailability of data for a gender analysis of the COVID-19 situation; (ii) high infection risks for \nhealth workers because of insufficient PPE; (iii) mental health issues caused by increased \nfinancial and health burdens; (iv) less focus on maternal and child health services; (v) limited \nfacilities and protocols for COVID-19 patients; and (vi) an increasing number of gender-based \nviolence cases. Because of the COVID-19 situation, pregnant women are avoiding public health \nfacilities. Peak-time critical COVID-19 cases require the full attention of about 21% of health \nworkers and often exceed their regular workload.32 This also worsened the annual maternal death \nto 3,200 (26% higher than the pre-COVID-2019 level) and increased unplanned pregnancies, \nincluding among teenage girls.33 HEAL will address these concerns by (i) providing PPE suited \nto both men and women, including menstrual hygiene products for women; 34 (ii) increasing the \ncapacity of health workers through training and communication activities; and (iii) ensuring that \nall new infrastructure and the national health and safety protocols are gender-sensitive.35 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n36.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the safeguard categories \nfor HEAL are as follows.  \n \n37.  Environment  (category  C).  The installation of new isolation facilities in 12 DOH \nselected hospitals and 2 selected BSL-2 laboratories will require minor civil works on existing \nhospital compounds that may cause minimal adverse environmental impacts. Impacts will be \nhighly localized and limited to a short construction period. A code of construction practice was \nprepared to guide environment and safety risk management during such works. The DOH PMT \nwill include construction supervision and environment management experts. The project will also \nsupport the provision of hazardous waste treatment facilities (para.17). Further, all the PPE and \nconsumables procured under the project will be utilized and disposed of in full compliance with \ngood environmental practices.  \n \n38.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). As stated in para. 37, HEAL will involve activities \nand minor civil works on existing hospital compounds that will not require any land acquisition or \nlead to any resettlement impacts.  \n \n39.  Indigenous peoples (category C). HEAL will not have any direct or indirect impacts on \nthe dignity, human rights, livelihood systems, or culture of indigenous peoples, or the territories \nor natural or cultural resources that indigenous peoples own, use, occupy, or claim as an ancestral \ndomain or asset. \n \n32  University of the Philippines \u2013 COVID-19 Response Team. 2020.
