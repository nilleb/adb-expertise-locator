INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2002 Country Programming Review Mission, the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) reconfirmed its request to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  prepare  an  environmental  improvement  project  for \nmanaging wastewater and controlling pollution and floods in Fuzhou City, capital of Fujian \nProvince (Map 1). The ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited the PRC in October 2002 and reached \nan  understanding  with  the  Fujian  provincial  government  (FPG)  and  Fuzhou  municipal \ngovernment  (FMG)  on  the  goals,  purpose,  outputs,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan,  and \nimplementation arrangements for the TA.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Wastewater disposal has historically been achieved through septic tanks, with effluents \ndischarged to the inland river and canal system.  Rapid development and increased population \ndensity have caused heavy pollution and frequent flooding of rivers and canals in urban areas. \nThe results are odor, nuisance, and high risk to health, particularly from waterborne diseases. \nThe Government has recognized that adequate environmental protection and pollution controls \nare  essential  preconditions  for  sustainable  economic  growth.  One  of  the  Government\u2019s \ndevelopment objectives is to improve the quality of the urban environment and to integrate \nenvironmental planning with economic and social development efforts. Government policies \nrequire that urban environmental pollution and ecological damage be controlled by 2010. State \nguidelines require that major cities, such as provincial capitals, have a wastewater treatment \nrate of 70% by the year 2010.2 However, many cities do not have adequate wastewater \ntreatment facilities to improve the quality of discharge into rivers and lakes. \n \n3.  The rivers in Fuzhou City are highly polluted due to inadequate treatment of wastewater \ndischarge. Expanding the sewer network and wastewater treatment capacity is urgently needed \nto improve environmental conditions in Fuzhou, and raise water quality in the local water \ncourses from the current Class V to Class IV.3 FPG and FMG have resolved to implement \nwastewater collection and treatment so as to achieve or improve on the State guidelines. \nAccordingly both sewage collection networks and wastewater treatment facilities have been \nconstructed (or are in the process of being completed) through the ADB-financed Fuzhou Water \nSupply and Wastewater Treatment Project,4 but further coverage and capacities are required. \nThe Project proposed by FMG will be an essential component in realizing Fuzhou\u2019s medium-  \nand long-term wastewater management programs.  \n \n4.  Fuzhou City is currently served by the Xiangban wastewater treatment plant (WTP) with \na capacity of 50,000 cubic meters (m3)/day and, effective from the end of 2002,  by Yangli \nphase I WTP with a capacity of 200,000 m3/day (Map 2).5 A second phase (Yangli phase II) to \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 2 April 2002.  \n2   China State Department Notice 2000(36) requires at least 60% by 2005 and 70% by 2010 for all major cities.  \n3  Based on the State Water Quality Classification Standards, Class I is pristine while Class V is polluted. The \nminimum quality normally considered suitable for urban water supply is Class III. Class IV is suitable for industrial \nand noncontact recreational use.  \n4  ADB. 1998. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Fuzhou Water Supply and Wastewater Treatment Project. Manila. The Project \ncomprises construction of a wastewater treatment plant and associated sewerage collection network connecting to \nabout 40% of the households in Fuzhou. The Project will be completed in June 2003. Central wastewater treatment \nfacilities treat both domestic and industrial wastewater. State and provincial laws require that industrial wastewater \nbe treated to remove heavy metals and toxic substances before discharging it to the sewerage systems. \n5  Yangli phase I WTP is funded by ADB (footnote 4).  ", "2 \nprovide an additional capacity of 100,000 m3/day is planned. The adjacent area of Nantai Island, \nwhich  is  designated  in  the  Fuzhou  City  Master  Plan6  for  rapid  urban  development  to \naccommodate the domestic and industrial growth of Fuzhou, will be served by two new WTPs. \nThe Jinshan WTP with a design capacity of 50,000 m3/day is under construction and a  new \nWTP at Lianban with an initial capacity of 150,000 m3/day, increasing to 400,000 m3/day in the \nfuture, is being planned. It is proposed that the Yangli phase II and Lianban WTPs be developed \nunder build, operate, transfer (BOT) principles or other similar models, and that the operation of \nYangli phase I be transferred to the private sector. The planned introduction of private sector \nparticipation in wastewater treatment is new in Fujian. Inward experience will be needed for \nestablishing BOT or other similar models for WTPs to ensure open tendering procedures, value \nfor money, and meeting the necessary targets and guarantees.   \n \n5.  Sewer pipes have been laid to serve the existing Xiangban WTP and the new Yangli \nphase I WTP under the new road network as it was developed. Accordingly an extensive \nsewerage system exists, but is not fully connected; nor does it cover the entire urban area of \nFuzhou. Modifications, additions, and extensions to the sewerage network are required to \nrationalize the drainage areas contributing to the respective WTPs, to connect isolated sewer \nlengths, to increase the connection rate to the networks, and to expand the coverage of the \nsystem to about 90% of the urban subdistricts north of the Min River. The total length of new \nsewers will be approximately 136 kilometers (km); 35 km of existing sewers will be desilted and \ncommissioned. The population served will rise from an existing 680,000 to about 905,000. To \noptimize the drainage areas contributing to the Xiangban and Yangli WTPs under the proposed \nexpansion of the sewerage system, some of the new areas will need to be connected to \nXiangban WTP. As Xiangban WTP only has a capacity of 50,000 m3/day, it is planned to \nreverse the pumping discharge such that some sewage currently draining to Xiangban WTP is \nredirected to Yangli WTP (phases I and II).   \n \n6.  A similar deficiency in the sewerage system exists on Nantai Island, which used to be \nlargely agricultural land. To facilitate the planned urbanization of up to 84 km2 of land under the \nFuzhou City Master Plan, approximately 110 km of new sewers and four pumping stations are \nto be constructed and about 8 km of existing sewers is to be desilted and commissioned. These \nworks will enable the wastewater system to serve a planned population of approximately \n488,000 in 2007 that is expected to grow to 710,000 in 2020.  \n \n7.   The natural inland waterways on Nantai Island were formed through scour of fluvial \ndeposits by storm runoff. A maze of small drainage meanders and channels was thus formed. \nThey have been modified by human activity, including fish farming and waste tipping, such that \na  fragmented  and  ineffective  drainage  system  now  exists.  Storm  water  runoff  results  in \nwidespread flooding, inundating up to 57% of the total land area.7 This situation is exacerbated \nby tidal locking of the existing outlets. To enable the planned urban development program to \nproceed, the Project will (i) rationalize inland drainage by developing 31 channels with a \nplanned total length of about 86 km on the existing waterways; (ii) excavate and remove \napproximately 39,000 tons (t) of construction material, 200 t of domestic solid waste, and 10 t of \nindustrial waste; (iii) construct stone-lined rectangular channels of varying widths; (iv) resettle \nabout 6,000 persons; (v) refurbish and extend, as necessary, 39 existing tidal gates; and (vi) \nrehabilitate five existing and construct six new drainage water pumping stations. \n                                                 \n6  Fuzhou City Master Plan 1995\u20132010, approved by the national government in May 1999. \n7  Total land area, including recently reclaimed land, measures 142 km2. Original land area was 108.7 km2, but \nflooding affects 62.4 km2.  ", "    3 \n8.  The inland waterways of Nantai Island are extremely polluted.8 The situation will be \nremedied by the proposed sewerage and wastewater treatment systems (paras. 4 and 6) and \nby maintaining a positive flow in the waterways by pumping river water during times of drought. \n \n9.  The completion of wastewater management for the Fuzhou City and inland drainage on \nNantai Island will satisfy with the requirements for city planning where existing areas are to be \nfully  serviced  and  new  development  areas  provided  with  full  and  effective  infrastructure. \nResidential, commercial, and industrial development is thus encouraged, resulting in improved \namenities, increased employment, and enhanced living standards.  \n \n10.  The conceptual project framework is in Appendix 1. An initial assessment of the social \nand  poverty  impact  of  the  Project  is  in  Appendix  2.  Impacts  on  poverty  will  be  through \nenvironmental  improvement  and  employment  generation  although  the  Project  will  involve \nsignificant resettlement. \n \n11.  Environmental improvement and environmental and natural resource management are \namong  ADB\u2019s  strategic  objectives  in  the  PRC.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  environment  and \nwastewater  sectors  is  focused  on  strengthening  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for \nsustainable  environmental  management,  supporting  integrated  water  and  wastewater \nmanagement, promoting tariff reform, and encouraging the use of cleaner technologies. ADB\u2019s \npoverty  reduction  strategy  for  the  PRC  envisages  a  range  of  measures  including  the \nimprovement of urban living conditions by providing safe drinking water and environmental \nprotection  and  by  promoting  employment  and  sustainable  growth.  Already  wastewater \nmanagement in Fuzhou City has been significantly improved through the Fuzhou Water Supply \nand Wastewater Treatment Project (footnote 4). The Project will further support FMG\u2019s efforts in \ncreating a clean and economically vibrant city for its growing population, including the poor, in \nline with the development objectives of the Government and ADB. \n \n12.  Policy dialogue on environmental and wastewater management issues will continue in \nparallel with the Project to enhance ADB\u2019s effort in the sector and strengthen the Government\u2019s \ncapacity to effect water conservation measures, tariff reform, private sector participation, and \nintegrated environmental management.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n13.  The project preparatory TA  will  assist  FMG  to  prepare  a  project  suitable  for  ADB \nfinancing. The TA will assess the technical, environmental, financial, economic, social, and \ninstitutional feasibility of an investment for (i) completing the second phase of sewerage to the \nurban areas of Fuzhou City; (ii) constructing a sewerage system for the proposed urban areas \nof Nantai Island; (iii) developing an inland waterway network and flood protection measures for \nNantai Island; and (iv) improving water quality in the urban streams from the current Class V to \nClass IV. The TA will also identify institutional capacity-building measures including introduction \nof private sector participation in wastewater management and policy reforms to ensure the \nsustainability of the Project and related facilities. \n \n14.  The  output  of  the  TA  will  be  workshops  and  a  series  of  reports  recommending \napproaches  necessary  in  achieving  least-cost,  sustainable  solutions  for  environmental \n                                                 \n8  The water quality is worse than Class V (see footnote 3).  ", "4 \nimprovement that will advance the Government\u2019s development master plans and assist in \nimproving living conditions, particularly those of the urban poor. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  The  TA  will  (i)  review  the  Fuzhou  City  Master  Plan  and  wastewater  management \nprograms and justify the proposed project components; (ii) carry out a water demand forecast \nand determine the potential for water conservation management practices within Fuzhou City; \n(iii) assess the present situation and predict future wastewater generation in the urban drainage \nareas; (iv) review and evaluate the technical options proposed by the prefeasibility studies and \nconfirm that the project components are the least-cost options in support of the Fuzhou long-\nterm  development  plans;  (v)  provide  cost  estimates  and  procurement  arrangements  and \nprepare  a  contract  packaging  plan;  (vi)  carry  out  economic  and  financial  analyses;  (vii) \nundertake environmental impact assessment (EIA) and prepare EIA and summary EIA (SEIA) \nreports; (viii) review and update the Government\u2019s land acquisition and resettlement plan (RP) \nand make a summary; (ix) update and analyze, as appropriate, the financial governance and \nfinancial performance of the FMG and the new companies which will be set up under FMG for \nthe construction and management of the project facilities; (x) recommend necessary enterprise \nand sector reforms; (xi) recommend further tariff reforms; (xii) carry out a social survey to \nevaluate the social and poverty impact of the Project, and identify ways to make the Project \nmore pro-poor; and (xiii) establish monitoring indicators and a monitoring mechanism.  The TA \nwill also help the Government introduce in the private sector BOT or other similar models of \nwastewater treatment, and develop suitable methodologies and procedures for procuring private \nsector contractors.   \n \n16.  The major assumptions in and risks to the successful implementation of the TA include \n(i) inadequate counterpart support and performance; (ii) lack of adequate and timely provision of \nnecessary data; (iii) delay in submitting required studies; (iv) delay in appointing and mobilizing \nconsultants; (v) inadequate performance by the consultants; and (vi) lack of private sector  \ninterest in participation in the Yangli phase II and Lianban WTPs. Efforts will be made to ensure \nthat competent consultants are recruited on time and that performance checks are carried out \nregularly. FMG agreed to provide adequate counterpart support and provide all necessary data \nwhen required, and to undertake and update all required studies according to a timetable \nagreed upon with ADB. Close coordination among the consultants, executing and implementing \nagencies, and ADB will further mitigate these risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $750,000 equivalent, of which $450,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $300,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $600,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$150,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of Spain. The Government of PRC has agreed to provide the balance of the local \ncurrency  cost,  equivalent  to  $150,000,  for  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  furniture, \nadministrative support, logistics, and interpretation services. The Government has been advised \nthat approval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project.  Details of the \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \n \n \n ", "    5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  FMG will be the executing agency for the TA. A senior official from FPG will chair the \nsteering committee for the TA, with members from FPG, FMG, Fujian Finance Bureau, Fuzhou \nFinance  Bureau,  Fujian  Planning  Committee,  Fuzhou  Planning  Bureau,  Fuzhou  Municipal \nConstruction Committee, and Fuzhou Urban Management Regulatory Bureau to ensure that \ntheir views will be adequately considered and necessary support will be provided. The TA office, \nestablished under Fuzhou Water Supply and Wastewater Treatment Project, will be retained to \nfacilitate interdepartmental arrangements and coordination among the concerned ministries and \ndepartments in the state, provincial, and municipal governments to support the work of the \nconsultants. A senior official of FMG will be the TA office director. A full-time qualified and \nexperienced senior staff member will be appointed as manager to oversee the implementation \nof the TA. Two full-time counterpart staff with relevant qualifications and experience will be \nassigned  to  assist  the  consultants.  To  facilitate  implementation,  FMG  will  support  the \nconsultants by providing a suitably furnished office with utilities and telecommunication access, \nmaterials, maps, data, and documents required by the TA. \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 4.5 months starting in February 2003, with \nexpected completion in July 2003. The total input of the consultants is estimated at 38 person-\nmonths: 14 international and 24 domestic. The consultants will provide expertise in wastewater \nand drainage engineering, environmental assessment, economic and financial analyses, social \nand poverty impact assessment, resettlement issues, institutional development, and private \nsector participation. The consultants will be engaged through a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants based on the quality and cost-based selection method \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. ADB\u2019s simplified technical proposal \napproach will be used in selecting and engaging the consultants.  \n \n20.  The consultants will submit to ADB an inception, an interim, a draft final, and a final \nreport. In addition, they will submit an EIA and SEIA report, an English translation of the \nGovernment\u2019s RP, and a summary RP. The executive summary of the interim report, and the \ncomplete draft final and final reports will be translated into Chinese to facilitate review by the \nGovernment. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 to the Government \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Spain \nfor the purpose of preparing the Fuzhou  Environmental Improvement Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.

Review of Medium-  and Long-Term Plans \n1.  The  consultants  will  review  and  analyze  the  medium-  and  long-term  plans  for \nwastewater management in Fuzhou City. In particular, reference will be to the final report \nprepared  under  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  technical  assistance  (TA)1  and  to  the \nprefeasibility reports2 prepared in August 2002 by the Fuzhou Planning Design Institute, the \nShanghai Municipal Engineering Design Institute, Fuzhou Environmental Protection Research \nInstitute, and Fujian Water Conservancy Planning Institute. The scope of works proposed under \nthe prefeasibility reports will be analyzed against the background of ongoing work for the ADB-\nfinanced Fuzhou Water Supply and Wastewater Treatment Project;3 the state, provincial, and \nmunicipal environment and wastewater management programs under the Tenth Five-Year Plan \n(2001-2005); and long-term city planning proposals. Recommendations will be made on the \nsuitability of the proposed works. Where necessary, the consultants will recommend changes to \nthe scope of works.   \n \n2.
