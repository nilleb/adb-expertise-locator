The proposed Improving Financial Access and Entrepreneurship Development Project  \nwill aim to expand the financial access and entrepreneurial capabilities of households and micro, \nsmall, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) by strengthening financial intermediation in Papua \nNew  Guinea  (PNG). 1 To  support  the  government\u2019s  implementation  of  its  finance  sector \ndevelopment strategy and financial inclusion and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) \npolicies, the proposed project will help (i) improve the financial capacity, behaviors, and access  \nof both men and women in households; (ii) improve the financial management and planning skills \nof MSMEs owned by both women and men, including MSMEs that develop and deploy solutions \nfor health care; (iii) improve the business and product management capacity of participating \nfinancial institutions (PFIs); (iv) increase the use of digital financial services (DFS); and (v) \nstrengthen the regulatory environment for microfinancing.2 \n \n2.  The proposed project will continue ADB\u2019s lead role in supporting greater financial inclusion \nin PNG through financial literacy programs and improving the capacity of microfinance institutions. \nIt will address the very low levels of financial access in the population at large and among MSMEs \nthat is weighing on entrepreneurship in a weakening economy and frustrates efforts to create jobs, \nraise incomes and reduce poverty. The project\u2019s estimated $31.6 million cost is to be financed \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources by a regular loan of $15.0 million and a concessional loan \nof $15.0 million, as well as by counterpart funding equivalent to $1.6 million from the government, \nsome of which will be in kind. All project procurement, disbursement, and the recruitment of \nconsultants will be carried in line with ADB guidelines. \n  \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) will be needed for project preparatory work to \nevaluate the approaches available, identify the appropriate implementation arrangements, and \ndesign the project properly. Many of the project\u2019s subsequent activities will be based on this \ntransaction TA study and analysis. The transaction TA will enable ADB to continue to consult \nrelevant stakeholders up to and beyond the submission of the proposed project for ADB Board \nconsideration, currently scheduled for the first quarter of 2021, and facilitate timely project start-\nup. The transaction TA will also provide support alongside ongoing consultations with government \ncounterparts that will be important to the effective delivery of the intended project outputs. The \ntransaction TA is in PNG country operations business plan for 2020-2022.3  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n4.  The transaction TA will support project-related diagnostic studies, including a finance \nsector assessment, economic and financial analysis, financial due diligence, a gender analysis \nand action plan, and the establishment of baseline data for monitoring. It will also enable the policy \ndialogue with the key stakeholders necessary to inform the preparation of a sound project design. \nThe transaction TA will have 5 outputs. \n \n1  The government confirmed its request for ADB assistance in the May and October 2019 consultation missions.  \n2  Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG). 2019.

The transaction technical \nassistance (TA) will appear in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website after concept clearance.  \n ", "2   \n5.   Through  these  5  outputs,  experts  will  help  in technical  assessments and  analysis, \nundertake  necessary  due  diligence  and  recommend  effective  design  and  implementation \narrangements for the project outputs. The transaction TA outputs will: (i) undertake necessary \ndue diligence to prepare the project; (ii) scope the required support for building financial and \nbusiness development capabilities for individuals, households and MSMEs, with particular focus \nto support women and MSMEs in the health sector; (iii) determine, through due diligence of PFIs \nor consultations with PFIs where due diligence was recently undertaken, the potential areas of \nrequired support, including options to facilitate the delivery of the needed support; (iv) assess the \nopportunities to facilitate development of or expansion of innovative and gender sensitive DFS; \nand (v) facilitate improvements to gender sensitive financial inclusion data collection, analysis and \nreporting  to  establish  sex-disaggregated  baselines  and  enable  monitoring  of  the  relevant \nindicators.  \n \n6.  Output 1: Due diligence to prepare the project completed. Due diligence will be \nconducted  to  help  prepare  the  project  and  determine  the  appropriateness  of  proposed \ninterventions. Due diligence documents for processing will be prepared with support of the \ntransaction TA. This will include a finance sector assessment, gender-sensitive economic and \nfinancial project analysis; financial due diligence, gender analysis and a gender action plan, and \nestablishment of baseline data for monitoring. A finance sector assessment will help establish the \nsector\u2019s key development needs by analyzing its strengths, constraints and weaknesses, risks, \npotential threats, and opportunities, including an assessment of MSMEs. Because the project will \nhave no revenue stream, the gender-sensitive economic and financial analysis will assess project \nefficiency and the benefits the investment will bring to PNG and its local communities. The \nfinancial management of the Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG), the proposed executing and \nimplementing agency, will be assessed through the financial due diligence. This will also include \na financial evaluation of the project and an examination of the implementation arrangements. The \ntransaction TA will support the gender analysis of the project, which is categorized as effective \ngender mainstreaming. A gender action plan will be prepared to help identify constraints on, \nneeds for, and the priorities in the empowerment of women. The results will inform the project\u2019s \ngender-inclusive output indicators and targets. \n \n7.  Due diligence and these assessments will make full use of documents and data based on \nthe significant work already done by government in its development of financial inclusion and \nMSME-related policies and strategies, as well as technical reports prepared by the Pacific Private \nSector Development Initiative.4 Available ADB templates will be followed to complete this output. \nThe indicative deadline for delivering this output is November 2020. \n \n8.  Output  2:  Potential  areas  of  support  for  building  financial  and  business \ndevelopment capabilities of households and businesses identified. The financial literacy \nprogram delivered under ADB\u2019s Microfinance Expansion Project will be reviewed under the \ntransaction TA with a view to making any changes that will improve the proposed project\u2019s training \ncontent or methods.5 The current financial literacy training in PNG will be examined, and the \npotential for the project\u2019s collaboration and partnerships with the institutions now delivering them \nexplored. The transaction TA supported study will seek to determine the best possible content to \nuse and the best approaches to take in project activities aimed at enhancing the financial \ncapabilities and behaviors of individuals, households and separately for MSMEs.

The forms of digital \ndelivery most suited to literacy training and the availability of devices and the connectedness and \nknow-how of household and MSME beneficiaries will also be considered, as will the possibility of \nproviding appropriate enabling training. The transaction TA will be crucial in informing the design \nof effective training for the project, which must be based on sound sex-disaggregated analysis of \ncapacities, constraints, preferences, priorities, and financial competency across a variety of age \nand income-level groups. \n \n9.  MSME-specific activities under the transaction TA will examine the training content and \napproaches required to build the capacity for better book-keeping, cash flow management, and \nfinancial planning in these businesses, as well as to further develop their entrepreneurship \ncapacity.  Current  programs  will  be  reviewed  before  feasible,  effective  training  options  are \nidentified to support the government\u2019s objectives. Consideration will also be given under the \ntransaction TA of possible ADB support to the BPNG for the establishment of a credit guarantee \ncorporation under the BPNG SME Accelerator Program.6 MSMEs are also considered to be the \norigins of innovations in the health sector and with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the \ntransaction TA will assess possible support to MSMEs to develop and deploy health care solutions \nin PNG. The indicative deadline for output 2 delivery is November 2020. \n \n10.  Output 3: Potential areas of support to participating financial institutions identified. \nThe transaction TA will help determine and design the support selected PFIs will require from the \nproject to improve the inclusiveness and quality of the financial services they provide. At least \nfour PFIs will be consulted on their operations and the areas in which they could potentially benefit \nfrom project support.7 These four or more selected PFIs will be micro banks and savings and loan \nsocieties. Any support requested will be analyzed to determine how it could help improve access \nto financial services by MSMEs and households. The sustainable pathways for project support or \nreforms will be assessed, taking into account possible synergies with other ongoing work in the \nfinance sector. Gender audits will be conducted of PFIs\u2019 structures, processes, procedures, and \npolicies to facilitate achievement of gender targets of the project. Due diligence on these PFIs will \nbe undertaken wherever necessary.8 Options for improving PFI staff capacity during the project \nfor delivering accessible, affordable, appropriate, and gender-sensitive financial services will be \nconsidered. Ways will also be sought under the transaction TA to improve the PFIs\u2019 abilities in \ncustomer credit risk assessment, creating awareness of their financial services and products, \nproviding customers with financial advice, and achieving a smooth roll-out of DFS. The indicative \ndeadline for delivery of output 3 is November 2020. \n \n11.  Output 4: Opportunities to support innovative digital financial services identified. \nPossible areas of project support for improving DFS in PNG will be examined. The country\u2019s \ncurrent overall  DFS  agenda  will  be  analyzed before  feasible  intervention  opportunities  are \nidentified.  Such  interventions  may  make  use  of  existing  or  planned  platforms  and  involve \nsynergies with established concepts or pilot projects. The PFIs will be consulted to gain a clear \nunderstanding of their strategic directions on DFS, their willingness to pilot and introduce digital \nproducts and services for both men and women clients, and their related upcoming DFS needs. \nObstacles to delivering physical financing services, limited connectivity, and PNG\u2019s infrastructure \n \n6  The Small Medium Enterprise Accelerator Program will be implemented through Bank of PNG and will focus on (i) \nimproving the small and medium-sized enterprises access to finance, (ii) advisory support to develop their financial \ncompetency, and (iii) promoting innovation and strategic partnerships. \n7  There are five microfinance institutions currently operating in PNG but one of these institutions is likely to be acquired \nby another at the commencement of project implementation. \n8  Some micro financial institutions have benefited from ADB technical assistance in 2019 and had due diligence \nexercises completed. Consent will be sought to access the due diligence reports to continue with necessary support. \n ", "4   \ndeficits  in  the  large,  often  rugged  outlying  regions  through  which  most  of  the  country\u2019s \ncommunities and people are scattered will be considered in assessing potential DFS solutions. \nThe indicative deadline for the delivery of this output is November 2020. \n \n12.  Output 5: Strategies to streamline collection and management of financial inclusion \ndata agreed. Deficiencies identified by a recent review in the financial inclusion data needed for \nthe project\u2019s sound design and monitoring will be addressed through the transaction TA. The \ncollection and management of this data, which is used to inform the intervention policies, is \nundertaken by the Centre for Excellence in Financial Inclusion (CEFI). CEFI is also the primary \ndriver of the financial inclusion agenda in PNG.9 The transaction TA activities will be guided by \ndiscussions with relevant stakeholders on the gathering and managing of sex-disaggregated \nfinancial inclusion data in PNG. The recommendations of the Financial Inclusion Data Analysis \nProject, which reviewed the collection and handling of financial inclusion data by CEFI and BPNG, \nwill be followed up.10 Tools that can be used to collect and streamline sex-disaggregated data \nprocessing by CEFI, the BPNG, and the financial institutions will be identified and assessed. An \nevaluation  of  the  quality  and  appropriateness  of  the  existing  database  may  result  in \nrecommendations for upgrades or changes. The relevant capacity-building needs including, data \nneeds, sources, entry, analysis for decision making at the PFIs, CEFI, and the BPNG will be \nascertained. The indicative deadline for the delivery of this output is November 2020. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The transaction TA is estimated to cost $787,500, of which $750,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of interagency coordination and other contributions, the value of \nwhich is estimated at $37,500.
