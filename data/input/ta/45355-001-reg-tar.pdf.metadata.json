INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) depends on developing member countries\u2019 (DMCs) \nown financial management system in its lending, so it is critical for them to have sound public \nsector  accounting  systems. This regional  capacity  development  technical  assistance1  (TA) \nseeks to improve the structure of public sector management by strengthening the accounting \nand reporting systems of governments and public sector enterprises. It is also designed to \nachieve  one  of  the  key  objectives  of  Strategy  2020\u2014promoting  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration. \n \n 2.  The International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB) is a standards-\nsetting body designated by, and operating under, the International Federation of Accountants \n(IFAC).  One of its main functions is to develop financial reporting standards for the public \nsector.  Standards  set  by  the  IPSASB  provide  the  foundation  for  achieving  the  long-term \nobjectives of (i) moving toward cash or accrual basis accounting2 and (ii) improving the quality \nand reliability of accounting and financial reporting for the public sector.   \n \n3.  Since  1997,  ADB  has  been  providing  technical  assistance  to  support  IPSASB\u2019s \nstandard-setting  program  through  the  regional  policy  and  advisory  TA  for  Public  Sector \nAccounting Standards (Phase 4)3 in developing accounting standards for public sectors. The \nController\u2019s Department (CTL) has been participating in the IPSASB forums and task forces for \nreviewing some of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). The IPSASB \nhas been emphasizing the need for more outreach programs to provide support for building the \ncapacity of DMCs by adopting the IPSAS and improving their overall financial reporting and \nmanagement framework. This capacity development TA aims to complement the policy and \nadvisory TA and to assist DMCs in formulating plans to improve their government accounting \narrangements,  particularly  in  legal  or  institutional  structures,  standard-setting  processes, \ninformation technology systems, and capacity building programs for government officials. This \npaper  defines  the  output,  methodology,  and  key  activities  of  the  project.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The recent global financial turmoil has emphasized the urgent need to have global \naccounting standards and professionally qualified accountants with appropriate technical skills \nin public sectors. The IFAC has been urging the Group of Twenty (G-20) Finance Ministers and \nCentral Bank Governors for financial reforms in the public sector and stressing the need for \nsustainability in public finances. It has promoted the importance of the accounting profession to \nprovide greater transparency and accountability in public sector finances by adopting a common \nset of accounting standards.  \n \n5.  Best practices identified by IFAC promote similar entities to maintain accounting systems \nthat enable each to prepare financial information in a timely, consistent, and comparable format. \nHowever, many DMCs do not have robust accounting standards and systems for financial \nreporting  and  management.  Recognizing  such  needs,  the  IPSASB  has  been  developing \naccounting standards that will allow governments to establish the accounting framework for their \n                                                \n1   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 October 2011. \n2   Under cash basis accounting, revenue is recorded when cash is received and expense is recorded when cash is \nspent while for accrual basis accounting, revenue and expense are recorded when they are earned or incurred, \nregardless of when cash is exchanged. \n3  ADB. 2009.  Public Sector Accounting Standards (Fourth Phase).  Manila \n ", "2   \npublic sector. The adoption of the IPSAS by governments will improve both the quality and \ncomparability of financial information reported by public sector entities around the world.  \n \n6.  The CTL has been participating in the IPSASB forums and task forces to review some of \nthe standards. It has also been working with DMCs in disseminating knowledge for maintaining \nsound fiduciary controls and accounting frameworks for a more effective administration and \nmonitoring of ADB\u2019s loans. However, there has been no extensive cross-border platform to \nstrengthen the overall government accounting framework. \n \n7.  This  TA  aims  to  assist  DMCs  in  strengthening  their  government  accounting  and \nreporting. It will address DMCs\u2019 needs to improve government accounting standards and related \ninformation  technology  systems  by  (i)  establishing  legal  or  institutional  arrangements,  (ii) \ndeveloping capacity in public sector accounting, (iii) establishing a platform for exchange of \nknowledge and focus on key issues, (iv) and organizing seminars and specific workshops on \nstrengthening government accounting.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  TA  is  expected  to  enhance  the  awareness  of  DMC  government  officials  on \ninternational accounting standards and practices to improve their financial reporting, which \nwould benefit from improved transparency and accountability. This knowledge would improve \nthe quality of financial management and reduce the risks of financial reporting fraud.  \n \n9.  Cross-border  interaction  will  support  collaborative  capacity  development  and  enable \nDMC  officials  to  increase  their  awareness  and  understanding  of  public  sector  accounting \npractices and to gain access to market developments and best practices. This TA will improve \nADB\u2019s understanding of the type and scope of assistances required by DMCs in government \naccounting and strengthen its insights and knowledge in this area. The TA will allow the CTL to \nliaise with other relevant areas in ADB to (i) conduct accounting forums for DMC government \nofficials, (ii) build awareness and capacity on accounting related challenges and issues, and (iii) \nprovide assistance to DMCs in strengthening the government accounting framework.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will be implemented in consultation with other relevant areas in ADB to assess \nthe readiness of the DMCs to enhance their government accounting framework and to identify \nparticipants from selected DMCs to achieve the appropriate mix of government and public \nsector enterprise officials. As a first step, one or two forums will be organized for targeted \nDMCs. These forums will serve as a platform for government officials to share information and \nknowledge relating to accounting practices and systems used in DMCs. Progress reports, news \nreleases, and survey results will be used to monitor the activities as well as provide information \nto the participants. \n \n11.  With the TA, ADB will perform a broad review of the current accounting practices in the \npublic sector area of DMCs. ADB will select two or three DMCs and assist in designing their \nplan and preparing and implementing their government accounting reforms. These results will \nbe presented in a regional forum of relevant government officials. The study paper identifying \ngood examples and success factors will be adjusted to reflect the results of discussions from the \n ", "    3 \nforum and will be circulated to participating DMCs. Also, ADB will conduct advisory studies in \nthe public sector accounting of a few countries (on a voluntary basis). \n \n12.  The  forum  will  allow  participants  to  gain  a  better  understanding  of  the  current \ndevelopments in the IPSAS and increase capacity in improving their financial reporting through \nknowledge sharing and cooperation among participating countries and institutions. The TA aims \nto  collaborate  closely  with  exemplary  countries  and  to  disseminate  the  experience  and \nknowledge  to  other  DMCs.  It  is  anticipated  that  the  DMCs  with  less  developed  financial \nreporting practices will  gain from knowledge sharing with countries that have more robust \naccounting framework and information technology systems, such as the Republic of Korea.  \n \n13.  The forum and initial study will be used to identify specific areas of challenges faced by \nDMCs in strengthening government accounting frameworks and adopting the IPSAS. The TA \naims to design customized workshops and training based on the specific interests of a country \nor group of countries. The workshops will address these countries\u2019 concerns and issues and be \ndesigned  to  discuss,  find  solutions,  and  develop  road  maps  to  strengthen  government \naccounting frameworks.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  and \nadministered by ADB.  The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA project, which will be implemented by the \nAccounting  Division  of  the  CTL.  Consultants  will  be  used  in  the  areas  of  public  sector \naccounting research and forum coordination. A team of accounting staff will coordinate and \nmanage the consultants\u2019 activities and coordinate the overall TA project. The project will be \ncarried out from December 2011 to December 2014.   \n \n16.  The TA will require two international consultants for 10\u201312 person-months and one \nnational consultant for about 12 person-months. The international consultants will comprise \nfinancial management and accounting specialists whose main task is to facilitate workshops and \nforums  in  public  sector  accounting.  The  national  consultant  will  provide  overall  support  in \nresearch, workshops, and forums coordination. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). The terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n17.  Consultants  will  be  used  throughout  the  TA  program,  and  outputs  will  include  (i) \ndeveloping questionnaires, surveys, and study reports; (ii) assist in conducting forums and \nworkshops  as  facilitators  and  speakers;  (iii)  undertaking  ad  hoc  projects  in  research, \nconsultation,  and  advisement;  and  (iv)  providing  administrative  support  to  ADB  staff  and \ninternational consultants. In addition, the TA funds will be used to cover the expenses of the \nforums and workshops, which include the venues, travel and accommodation for participants, \nand other miscellaneous administrative and support costs.  \n \n ", "4   \nIV.
