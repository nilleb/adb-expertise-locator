INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Nepal has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  to  prepare  the  Governance  Reforms  and \nDecentralization Cluster Program (GRDCP) I included in the country strategy and program \n2005\u20132009.1 The PPTA is programmed for ADB\u2019s 2006 TA program for Nepal. The PPTA Fact-\nFinding Mission2 visited Kathmandu, Nepal, from 12 February to 3 March 2006 to ascertain the \ncontext, scope, and direction of the proposed TA. In light of the political changes that took place \nin Nepal in April 2006, a subsequent mission3 from 26 June to 7 July 2006 assessed the \nimplications of the changing governance situation for the proposed TA. During the second \nmission, an agreement was reached with the Government on the impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, costs, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for the \nPPTA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Background. With a low per capita gross domestic product (of about $311), and a \npoverty incidence of 38%, Nepal is undoubtedly one of the poorest countries in the world. \nCompounding the problem in the past decade or so\u2014and until only very recently\u2014has been a \nviolent insurgency, which has not only aggravated life for ordinary people in rural areas but also \ncontributed to political instability at the central level. In April 2006, popular demonstrations \nagainst the King, who had usurped total power in 2005, led to the reinstatement of Parliament \nand the restoration of democratic freedoms. There is hope that Nepal will now finally see a \nsustained  period  of  political  stability,  although  much  work  to  create  a  sustainable  political \nsystem remains. \n \n3.  This  recent  political  change  in  Nepal  should  be  a  seen  as  a  positive  step  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s fight against poverty. The causes of poverty in Nepal are varied: inadequate \naccess to basic social and education services, poor public sector governance, and uneven \ndistribution of the benefits of growth to the population are but a few. Improving public sector \ngovernance is essential and includes, among others, (i) transparency in government work, \n(ii) increased  decentralization  to  local  governments,  and  (iii)  improved  delivery  of  public \nservices. \n \n4.  Government  Approach.  Plans  for  good  governance  in  Nepal  have  hinged  on  the \nfollowing: (i) people-centered and inclusive governance, (ii) effective public service delivery, \n(iii) improved government accountability and transparency, and (iv) accelerated decentralization. \nSystems reforms in the country have centered on reorganizing central administration, and \nimproving  its  relationships  with  local  administrations.5  This  set  of  reforms,  for  now,  has \nconcentrated  on  some  key  aspects,  including  the  beginnings  of  a  legal  basis  for  good \ngovernance, and a decentralization program, to make public service delivery more effective.6 \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program (2005\u20132009): Nepal. Manila. \n2  The Mission comprised Gambhir Bhatta, Senior Governance Specialist, SAGF/SARD, Mission Leader; and Surya \nP. Shrestha, Senior Governance and Capacity Building Officer, Nepal Resident Mission, SARD.  \n3  The second mission consisted of the members of the first one, as well as X. Fan, Economist, SAGF/SARD.  \n4   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 13 June 2006. \n5  At present, five development regions, 14 zones, 75 district development committees, 58 municipalities, and almost \n4,000 village development committees compose noncentral government in Nepal. \n6  The Government is also currently targeting changes in the civil service. There are proposals to move the civil \nservice structure from a positional one (clerks, undersecretary, etc.) to one based on levels (support staff, \nprofessional, and executive levels, with grades or steps in each). However, the Government has also proposed ", "2   \n5.  On governance reforms at the central level, the previous government had issued the \nOrdinance for Realization of Good Governance in early 2006, which focused on (i) demarcating \nthe  responsibilities  of  elected  politicians  from  those  of  career  civil  servants,  (ii) minimizing \nconflict  of  interest  in  government  work,  (iii)  increasing  transparency  in  administration, \n(iv) improving access to information about government work, and (v) delegating bureaucratic \nauthority. The Ordinance is still valid, even as far-reaching political changes are being debated \nand the current government has yet to fully express its support for it. \n \n6.  On  subnational  administration,  the  Constitution  of  Nepal  1990  envisages \ndecentralization as a fundamental element of multiparty democracy. This is expected to be \nenshrined  even  more  deeply  in  a  new  constitution  that  will  be  prepared  by  a  constituent \nassembly  in  2007.  However,  at  present,  there  is  little  harmonization  between  the  various \nsectoral acts and the Local Self Governance Act, 1999. In early May 2006, the new government \nannulled  the  municipal  elections of  February  2006,  and  also  canceled  the  appointment  of \nregional and zonal administrators who had been appointed by the King. This means that the \nGovernment\u2019s decentralization policy is now in need of a substantive review, and these reforms \nmust be channeled to improve effectiveness of service delivery at the local level. \n \n7.  ADB Strategy. ADB\u2019s strategy for development in Nepal\u2014which includes measures for \npoverty reduction, economic growth, inclusive social development, and good governance\u2014is \nconsistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  priorities  in  governance  reforms,  decentralization,  and \neffective  service  delivery.  The  PPTA  being  considered  here  is  also  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \nstrategy for development in Nepal for 2005\u20132009, which focuses on improving the delivery of \npublic services, supporting practices that increase the accountability and transparency of public \nservice delivery, and supporting civil service reforms. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The PPTA will support the initiatives of the Government in ensuring good governance, \nas reflected in more transparent, predictable, and accountable local government administration, \nas well as better frontline service delivery and less corruption in the public sector, through active \npublic participation. The intended outcome of the PPTA is the design of a program that will \ncontribute to better development outcomes by improving governance. The program is critical not \nonly in attaining the development goals stated by the Government but also in resolving conflict \nand broadening the development space in the country, given the fact that the conflict centers on \nthe exclusion of vast segments of the rural populations from government services, as well as \nopportunities for economic growth. \n  \n9.  The expected outputs of the PPTA are (i) an analysis of service delivery standards and \nlessons from experience gained elsewhere, to serve as benchmarks for the program; (ii) reports \non unmet needs and lack of capacity at the central agencies to improve service delivery, and \nassessments of local service delivery needs; (iii) realistic action plans for strengthening the \ncapacity  of  central  institutions  and  local  governments,  as  well  as  community-based \norganizations,  to  deliver  better  services  (including  ways  of  increasing  transparency  and \naccountability, and reducing corruption in local service delivery); (iv) clear, and achievable, \nplans  for  effective  decentralization  (including  monitoring  systems)  in  the  education  and \n                                                                                                                                                          \ntime-bound movements upward for civil servants up to the rank of section officer, and civil servants up to the post \nof undersecretary can now join trade unions. The bill is expected to be presented in Parliament shortly. ", "  3\nagriculture sectors; (v) redesigned tools (such as citizens\u2019 cards and public expenditure tracking \nsurveys) to ensure that local service providers can be held accountable for their performance; \nand (vi) a well-designed report and recommendation of the President (RRP) for consideration by \nADB. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  Principles and Premises. The PPTA, and the ensuing loan program in the first phase, \nwill be focused primarily on local service delivery in partnership with community groups and \nother local actors.7 It will also target governance at all levels (at the central level with relevant \ngovernment ministries, at the intermediate level with intermediary institutions,8 and at the local \nlevel with local nongovernment organizations and civil society groups). A key area of focus of \nthe program will be inclusive development and ways of ensuring better access to public services \nfor marginalized and disadvantaged social groups. The marginalization of these groups is a \ncentral factor in the ongoing conflict in the country. \n \n11.  The other broad principles of the program include (i) drawing from\u2014and, where relevant, \nsupporting\u2014other  ADB  projects  and  programs;9  (ii)  being  practical  and  realistic,  including \nstarting  out  in  a  few  selected  sectors10  before  widening  sectoral  and  spatial  coverage; \n(iii) ensuring proper phasing and sequencing (Supplementary Appendix A); (iv) considering \ninnovative and novel ways of improving local service delivery (such as the use of international \nvolunteers to provide sector-specific expertise); and (v) considering existing systems in local \ngovernments when designing improvements in service delivery.11 \n \n12.  PPTA Components. The PPTA will comprise four parts: (i) part A: review of service \ndelivery protocols in central bodies, (ii) part B: assessment of service delivery needs in specific \nsectors at the local level, (iii) part C: improvement of service delivery, and (iv) part D: design of \nthe GRDCP. \n \n13.  Part A: Review Service Delivery Protocols in Central Level Bodies. The institutional, \nfinancial and fiscal, business process, and other provisions of service delivery policy (including \n                                                 \n7  ADB experience has shown that decentralized delivery of public services has been effective in situations where \nthere has been increased participation of, and partnerships with, civil society. Experience from the Decentralization \nSupport Program in 2002 (ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President on Proposed Program and \nTechnical Assistance Loans to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Decentralization Support Program. Manila \n[Loans 1935\u2013PAK, 1936-PAK, 1937-PAK, and 1938-PAK, approved on 21 November]) has also shown that, in \nimplementing decentralization programs, there is need to ensure, among others, that (i) districts act substantially in \naccordance with the spirit of the relevant acts, (ii) management plans are well designed with clear implementation \npriorities and targets (including the kinds of expertise required), and (iii) rigorous monitoring and evaluation \nsystems are in place.  \n8  Three key intermediate-level actors that are relevant to the program are the (i) Municipalities Association of Nepal; \n(ii) Association  of  District  Development  Committees,  Nepal;  and  (iii)  Association  of  Village  Development \nCommittees, Nepal. \n9  Such as information and communication technology for public service delivery (Project No. 38347). \n10  The Government\u2019s intent is to start devolution across the board; but given the need to ascertain first the \ndemonstrational aspects of local governance and development, only the education and agriculture sectors (where \nthe public has the most interface with government) will be included in the first phase of the loan program (until the \nend of 2009). (See Supplementary Appendix A for a description of the program phasing and sequencing.)

Part B: Assessment of Service Delivery Needs in Specific Sectors at the Local \nLevel.  The  institutional,  financial  and  fiscal  business  processes,13  and  other  provisions  of \nservice delivery policy at the district and local levels will be ascertained. Part of this assessment \nwill  be  on  whether  devolved  authority  for  service  delivery  devolved  to  district  and  local \nauthorities has parallel assigned authority for budget and expenditures. Corruption mitigation \nmeasures will also be incorporated in the design of business processes. \n \n15.  Part C: Improve Service Delivery Provisioning. The improvements will also entail \nbuilding  the  capacity  of  local  governments  (and  the  local  government  service  when  it  is \nestablished), as well as community-based organizations, to deliver more effective service; and \nusing tools, such as citizens\u2019 report cards and public expenditure tracking, so that service \nproviders can be held accountable for their performance. \n \n16.  Part D: Design the GRDCP. The PPTA will finally prepare a loan program for possible \nfunding from the Asian Development Fund. The focus will be on sustained governance reforms \nover the long term at the central government level, and service delivery effectiveness at the \nlocal level. Before drawing up the program, the PPTA will carry out preparatory studies to \nexamine the feasibility of each project component and to comply with various ADB policies and \nrequirements  for  possible  loan  financing  (including  preparing  an  indigenous  people\u2019s \ndevelopment plan, if required). An initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n17.  These proposed components are interrelated: the central Government must have the \ncapacity to manage the devolution and governance process; otherwise, frontline service delivery \nat the local level is not likely to succeed. The Government is still in the initial phases of its plan \nto initiate full decentralization, and for this plan to succeed, and service delivery to improve, all \nthe components must be addressed as a whole. \n \nC.   Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The PPTA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent, of which ADB will finance $500,000 on a \ngrant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government \nwill provide $100,000 equivalent to finance part of the local currency cost to cover counterpart \nstaff, office facilities, administrative support, and other expenses such as in-country facilitation. \nThe detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been \ninformed that approval of the PPTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n12 This component of the PPTA is expected to benefit from a series of discussions that the TA team will help organize \nboth at central and district levels. The discussions will deal with just how service delivery is to be improved and \nwhat roles community groups, the private sector, and local governments can play in this. The TA team will also \norganize sessions to debate and discuss the envisioned governance reforms at all levels. \n13 One particular area of work in this component will be considering the status of relevant procurement laws, \nregulations, and associated administrative rules governing current procurement practices and the implications of \ndecentralization (including the needed capacity to manage local procurement). ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers (OPMCM) will be the Executing \nAgency. This will ensure that governance and service delivery is widely seen as a crosscutting \ntheme. A senior official of OPMCM (of at least the rank of joint secretary) will be designated as \nthe program director. A steering committee will be established, to be chaired by the chief \nsecretary  at  OPMCM,  and  to  have  representatives  of  the  sector  line  ministries  and  other \nagencies as members.14 The steering committee will meet once every 3 months, and provide \npolicy oversight to\u2014and monitor and guide the implementation of\u2014the PPTA, and resolve \nissues that may arise during PPTA execution. \n \n20.  The PPTA will be implemented by a team of five national consultants from a domestic \nfirm for 60 person-months. The team will comprise a governance expert (12 person-months), \nwho will also be the team leader; two sector administration and service delivery experts (12 \nperson-months each) in the education and agriculture sectors; and two subnational government \nadministration and decentralization experts (12 person-months each). All consultants will be \nselected and hired according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The quality- and \ncost-based selection method (with simple technical proposal) will be used to select the domestic \nfirm that will provide the consultancy services. The project is complex and specialized and will \nhave  a  high  impact  on  the  service  delivery  capacity  of  government  in  a  post-conflict \nenvironment, and, therefore, the quality of the consultancy service is considered more important \nthan  the  costs  in  this  project.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  in \nAppendix 4. \n \n21.  Equipment  will  be  procured  through  the  shopping  method,  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines.15 After the PPTA, all equipment will be retained by the government \nagency  that  is  using  them.  PPTA  implementation  is  expected  to  last  12  months,  from \nDecember 2006 to November 2007. \n \n22.  The steering committee will disseminate the results of the PPTA project, and the PPTA \nevaluation results will be made publicly available on the ADB website. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Nepal for preparing the Governance Reforms and Decentralization Cluster \nProgram I, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n14  Other agencies involved could include: (i) Ministry of General Administration, (ii) Ministry of Local Development, \n(iii) Public  Service  Commission,  (iv)  sectoral  ministries  in  agriculture  and  education,  (v)  National  Planning \nCommission, (vi) Ministry of Finance, (vii) National Vigilance Center, and (viii) intermediary institutions (such as the \nAssociation of Village Development Committees, Nepal; Association of District Development Committee, Nepal; \nand Municipalities Association of Nepal). \n15  The procurement guidelines, and particularly harmonization of the procurement procedures, were key issues \nThaed dvrieeswsesd e bxyp rtehses 2e0d0 4h earnedin 2 a0r0e5  tchoousnetr yo fp tohretfo clioon rseuviletawn tm aisnsdio dnos.  nWoht inlee cthees scuarrrielyn tr egporveesrnemnte tnht ohsaes  odfe AciDdeBd\u2019 sto  \nmreemvibewer sa,l l Bpooalircdie so f pDroirmeucltgoartse,d M bayn tahgee pmreevniot,u osr  rsotyaaflf , gaonvde rmnmaeyn bt e( inpcrleuldiminign aar y2 0in0 6n aotrudrinea. n ce on procurement \nreforms), it has also given its assurance that it will take initiatives for procedural reforms through the 34-point policy \nand program document for fiscal year 2006.
