Similarly, if the social \nassessment finds any impact to indigenous peoples, as described in the ADB SPS 2009, the indigenous peoples \ndevelopment plan will be prepared by the consultant. In both cases, the safeguard categorization will be updated. \n2  External financing will not be pursued as this PPTA is focused on the due diligence for the MFF and tranche 1. \n ", "3 \nthat approval of the PPTA does not commit ADB to finance the ensuing program or any of its \ntranches. \n \nTable A3.2: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($'000) \n Item  Total Cost \n Asian Development Banka   \n1.
