INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Mongolia has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide technical assistance (TA) for capacity development in urban transport. During the fact-\nfinding mission in July 2012, ADB and the government reached an understanding on the impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, costs, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference for consulting services for the Ulaanbaatar Urban Transport Capacity Development \nTA. The TA is in line with the ADB country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014 for Mongolia.1 \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \nA.  Challenges in Ulaanbaatar Urban Transport \n2.  The need for sustainable urban transport in Ulaanbaatar is one of the most important \ndevelopment issues facing the country. The transition to a market economy since the 1990s and \na series of severe winters have resulted in the migration of many low-income families from the \ncountryside into the ger3 areas around Ulaanbaatar. The city\u2019s population increased from about \n600,000 in 1989 to more than 1.17 million in 2010, representing 42% of the nation\u2019s population \n(2.8 million). Given the limited employment opportunities in other parts of the country, migration \nto Ulaanbaatar is expected to continue and is estimated to reach 1.4 million in 2020 and \n1.7 million in 2030.4 \n \n3.  Since 1998, the number of registered vehicles in Ulaanbaatar has increased more than \nfour times.5 Unplanned urbanization and the increasing fleet of vehicles have overwhelmed the \ncity\u2019s transport system, contributing to congestion and poor air quality. Poor traffic management, \ninsufficient  parking  management  and  enforcement,  excessive  and  inappropriate  on-street \nparking  spaces,  lack  of  pedestrian  facilities,  poor  driver  discipline,  and  inadequate  traffic \nsignaling and control exacerbate the traffic congestion. Increased travel time and frequency, \nexcessive fuel use, and health problems due to vehicle emissions are reducing the quality of life \nin Ulaanbaatar. \n \n4.  Despite the rapid increase in motor vehicles, most Ulaanbaatar residents rely on public \ntransport or walking to move about the city. The congestion problem has reduced the quality \nand reliability of their travel in the city. With an uncontrolled interaction of pedestrians and \nvehicles, traffic accidents are common.6 Ulaanbaatar routinely accounts for over 70% of annual \ntraffic  accidents  in  the  country.  An  incidence  of  75  deaths  per  100,000  vehicles  per  year \nhighlights the need for continued improvements in urban road safety and better protection for \npedestrians.7 \n \n5.  Ulaanbaatar needs support to strengthen its capacity to improve and manage its urban \ntransport  system.  This  includes  strengthening  capacity  for  preparing  and  coordinating \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2012.

Need for Capacity Development \n6.  The Municipal Government of Ulaanbaatar (MGU) is preparing a city master plan for \ndeveloping the city\u2019s infrastructure, including urban roads, public transport, transport services, \nand traffic management. In line with the city master plan, MGU established a road fund and bus \nimprovement  fund  to  finance  road  network  construction,  maintenance  works,  and  bus \nreplacement. However, MGU also faces gaps and limitations in its capacity to address urban \ntransport  problems,  prepare  long-term  policy  directions,  generate  integrated  solutions  for \ndifferent  subsectors  of  urban  transport  in  a  sustainable  and  efficient  way,  and  coordinate \ninvestments  by  different  international  development  partners  (ADB,  the  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction and Development, the Export-Import Bank of Korea, the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank). \n \n7.  Alongside  MGU,  a  range  of  agencies  have  responsibilities  for  urban  transport  in \nUlaanbaatar,  including the  Public  Transport  Department,  the  Road  Department,  the  Traffic \nPolice,  the  Road  Department  of  the  Capital  City  Government  of  Ulaanbaatar,  the  Road \nDepartment of the Ministry of Transport, and transport-related nongovernment organizations. \n \n8.  MGU and the urban transport agencies need increased capacity for (i) development, \nimplementation,  and  enforcement  of  urban  transport  policy  and  strategy;  (ii) long-term \ninvestment planning, capital budgeting, and financial management; (iii) design and management \nof urban transport projects financed by international development partners; and (iv) technical \nknowledge and skills in transport planning, traffic engineering, public transport, and traffic safety. \n \n9.  ADB has approved a multitranche financing facility for the Urban Transport Development \nInvestment Program8 to support upgrading of Ulaanbaatar\u2019s public transport system, including \nintroducing a city-wide bus rapid transit network and traffic management system over the next \n6\u20139 years. This investment program will follow an integrated approach to urban transport-\nrelated  investment  activities  in  the  city,  including  coordination  of  activities  financed  by \ninternational development partners as well as MGU\u2019s. TA is needed to support associated \ncapacity  development  for  planning,  implementing,  and  managing  the  program  and  related \ninvestment activities. The TA is closely aligned with the objectives of ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy, 2012\u20132016 for Mongolia, which highlights the need to support the development of \nsustainable urban transport systems in Ulaanbaatar.9 \n \n10.  Through the TA, MGU will prepare detailed implementation plans for the development of \nurban  transport  in  Ulaanbaatar  and  strengthen  implementation  capacity  in  various  urban \ntransport subsectors. Initially, this will require a combination of policy analysis and consultations \nand training for decision-makers to support preparation of the implementation plans. \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 2012.

The impact of the TA will be improved capacity of Ulaanbaatar urban transport agencies \nfor  planning  and  managing  urban transport  in  an  integrated  and sustainable  manner.  The \noutcome will be enhanced awareness and knowledge of sustainable urban transport planning \nand management among Ulaanbaatar urban transport agencies. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will provide an opportunity for improving coordination between urban transport \nrelated agencies through TA activities covering six components: (i) sustainable urban transport, \n(ii) transport planning and management, (iii) traffic safety and enforcement, (iv) public transport \nplanning and management, (v) intelligent transport systems, and (vi) financial management and \nprocurement. \n \n13.  The  TA  will  have  three  outputs:  (i)  a  diagnostic  report  on  the  Ulaanbaatar  urban \ntransport situation, problems, issues, constraints and policy directions; (ii) training materials and \nguidelines  for  the  six  components  produced  and  trainings  provided;  and  (iii)  improvement \nmeasures for the six components..The outputs will be produced through in-house advisory \nactivities, case studies and the collaborations of different agencies of MGU, the Traffic Police, \nthe Road Department of the Capital City Government of Ulaanbaatar, the Road Department of \nthe Ministry of Transport, and transport-related nongovernment organizations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,150,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  suitably  furnished  offices  with  utilities; \ntelecommunications  access;  materials,  maps,  data,  and  documents  required  by  the  TA; \ncounterpart professional and support staff; and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MGU  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  implementing  agencies  will  comprise  the \ndepartments  of  public  transport,  roads,  and  information  technology;  and  other  agencies \nresponsible for urban transport in Ulaanbaatar: the project implementation unit for the ADB-\nfinanced program, the public transport and road departments of the Capital City Government of \nUlaanbaatar; the Traffic Police, and the Road Department of the Ministry of Transport. The TA \nwill be implemented from November 2012 to November 2014. \n \n16.  The TA requires 17 person-months of international and 32 person-months of national \nconsultant inputs for the TA components engaged through a firm or individual in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \nDisbursement  of  the  TA  will  be  undertaken  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). TA equipment will be procured \nby the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from \ntime to time) and turned over to MGU upon completion of the TA. The selection of the consulting \nfirm will use quality- and cost-based selection with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. The consulting \n ", "4  \nfirm will be required to submit a simplified technical proposal covering all aspects of the terms of \nreference. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n17.  The  TA  consulting  team  will  submit  periodic  progress  reports  as  applicable.  The \nconsultants will conduct three workshops to present findings and recommendations and solicit \nfeedback from key stakeholders. Senior officials from MGU and other relevant ministries and \nagencies will be closely consulted and involved during TA implementation and the review of the \nTA outputs. They will be invited to participate in the TA review workshops and discussions. ADB \nmissions will monitor TA progress and performance. The ADB project team is expected to \nprepare  and  disseminate  working  papers  describing  key  findings,  recommendations,  and \nlessons from TA implementation. \n \nIV.
