THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nand grant to the Kyrgyz Republic for the COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support \n(CARES) Program, under the Countercyclical Support Facility\u2013COVID-19 pandemic response \noption (CPRO).1  \n \n2.  The proposed CARES program is part of an integral package of support to help the \ngovernment\u2019s immediate efforts to mitigate the significant negative health, social, and economic \nimpacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The CPRO will provide budget support \nto help finance countercyclical development expenditures in the supplementary 2020 national \nbudget. This support will deliver (i) social protection for the poor and vulnerable, (ii) the health \nsector response, and (iii) a pro-poor fiscal stimulus package to safeguard productive sectors and \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from the economic downturn. The CARES program \nwas developed in close coordination and consultation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), \nwhich confirmed in its 2020 Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) that the Kyrgyz Republic remains \nat moderate risk of debt distress, and that it has some space, for both external debt and overall \npublic  debt.2 The  CARES  program  will  generate  a  substantial  regional  public  good  and \ncomplement cooperation efforts to contain the pandemic in the Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) region. The CARES program will also help implement CAREC 2030, \nespecially  its  operational  cluster  53 and  the  Operational  Plan  for  Integrated  Disaster  Risk \nManagement 2014\u20132020 of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB).4 \n \n3.  The Kyrgyz Republic is one of the most open and integrated economies in the CAREC \nregion with a population of more than 6.5 million as of the beginning of 2020 and an estimated \ngross national income per capita of $1,220 (Atlas method, 2018 prices).5 The Kyrgyz Republic is \nalso landlocked, which means that transit arrangements with its neighbors will always be critical. \nKazakhstan, to the northwest, is its second-largest export market, its third-largest investor, and \nthe country\u2019s lifeline for all transit trade through to major trade markets in the Russian Federation, \nthe Middle East, and Europe. The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), to the southeast, is its \nlargest investor and a major supplier of food and industrial goods such as equipment and textile \nproducts, accounting for 35.4% of its total imports. Regional cooperation is key to the country\u2019s \neconomic growth, in terms of cross-border trade (including transit trade) with other countries. The \nKyrgyz Republic\u2019s openness and integration also means that it is at high risk of exposure to the \npandemic through its significant migrant population and exposure to cross-border contamination.6 \n \n4.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  meets  all  of  the  access  criteria  of  ADB\u2019s  CPRO  under  the \nCountercyclical Support Facility, which include robust macroeconomic management, undertaking \nof key structural reforms, a pro-poor countercyclical expenditure program, and public debt levels \nmaintained at sustainable levels (see Table 1 and Appendix 4). The CARES program is also \naligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,  including  operational  priorities  on addressing remaining \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2020.

Adverse impact of  Assuming the impact from COVID-19 will last for the first half of 2020, the IMF \nexogenous shock   estimates that real GDP growth would slow from 4.5% to 0.4%, inflation increase \nfrom 3.1% to 12%, and the current account deficit to widen from 9.2% to 14.5% \nof GDP. The fiscal deficit would increase from 0.1% to 7.8% of GDP and public \ndebt would peak at 66% of GDP from 54.1%.  \n2.  Countercyclical  The government\u2019s $248 million COVID-19 Countercyclical and Health Response \ndevelopment expenditure   Plan provides the foundation for a pro-poor countercyclical expenditure program \nthat is geared towards supporting social protection and food security, an \nenhanced health sector response (in particular, protecting the MOH 2020 \nnational budget allocation of $240 million), productive sectors and small and \nmedium-sized enterprises, and budget stabilization. \n3.  Pre-shock record of  Prior to the onset of COVID-19, the IMF assessed the Kyrgyz Republic economy \ngenerally sound  and concluded that macroeconomic and financial sector performance in 2019 \nmacroeconomic  was broadly sound. Real GDP growth increased to 4.5% in 2019 due to a pickup \nmanagement  of both gold and non-gold output. The output gap was closed but both headline \nand core inflation remained well below the inflation target range (5\u20137%). The \ncurrent account deficit narrowed to 9.3% of GDP in 2019 (compared to 12.3% in \n2018), driven by both higher gold exports and lower imports. Gross official \nreserves stabilized at 3.9 months of imports of goods and services, reflecting the \nnet impact of purchases of locally produced gold offset partly by foreign \nexchange sales. The budget deficit of the general government decreased to \n0.1% of GDP in 2019, and, as a result, public debt decreased to 54% of GDP. \n4.  Structural reforms  Kyrgyz Republic is taking credible steps to address the spread of COVID-19 and \nmitigate its economic impacts on the population (Tables 2 and 4). In the \nimmediate- to short-term, the government has closed its border with PRC, \nimposed a lockdown in major urban centers, signed COVID-19 anti-crisis fiscal \nmeasures, and has reached out to development partners to mobilize resources \nto help finance its COVID-19 Countercyclical and Health Response Plan. \n5.  Debt sustainability   DSA conducted by ADB and IMF concluded that the Kyrgyz Republic was at \nmoderate risk of debt distress, there is some space, around 3\u20134% of GDP (or \n$240 million to $320 million), for both external debt and overall public debt, and \nthat its debt carrying capacity was strong. Furthermore, the proposed CARES \nprogram loan of $50 million represents only 1.5% of the country\u2019s outstanding \npublic debt stock of $4.65 billion. It will not significantly affect the debt ratio, nor \nwill  it  add  significantly  to  the  annual  debt  service  obligations  facing  the \nGovernment. \n6.  IMF Coordination   Coordination and collaboration with the IMF has been particularly strong. ADB \nhas closely coordinated with IMF on the macroeconomic situation, COVID-19 \nimpact and the government\u2019s financing needs. IMF\u2019s assessment is provided \nthrough IMF Country Report No. 20/90 of March 2020 (see Linked Document 4). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, DMC = developing member country, DSA = debt \nsustainability analysis, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International Monetary Fund, MOH = Ministry of Health. \na  More detailed information is contained in Appendix 4. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n5.  Pre-COVID-19 economic outlook. At the end of December 2019, the macroeconomic \noutlook was positive. The 2019 Asian Development Outlook Update projected economic growth \n \n7  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila.   \n ", "  3\nof 4.0% in 2020, driven by improved remittances and gold production and exports.8 Inflation was \nforecast to moderately increase as a consequence from 2.0% to 3.5%. The current account deficit \nwas projected to decline to 9.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) with higher gold exports. A \nhigher budget deficit compared to 2017 and 2018 was targeted but was expected to remain below \n3.0% of GDP and was in line with the fiscal rule adopted by the government of stabilizing public \ndebt at 54% of GDP by 2024. Poverty and inequality levels have also been gradually declining, \nwith poverty incidence of 25% in 2019 compared with 30% in 2015. At the end of the 2019 Article \nIV Consultations in July 2019, IMF concluded that the country had made progress toward \nmacroeconomic and financial stability.9 \n \n6.  Onset and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is \nhaving  a  severe  impact  on  developing  Asian  and  Pacific  economies  through  numerous \nchannels\u2014including adverse effects on health, sharp declines in consumption and investment, \nless tourism and exports, and disruptions in trade and production\u2014that led to loss of employment \nand income for workforces. Full magnitude of the economic, health, and social losses will depend \non how the outbreak evolves and how long it takes to control it. ADB\u2019s most recent assessment, \nreleased on 1 April 2020, estimates a global impact of $2.0 trillion\u2013$4.1 trillion in losses, equal to \n2.3%\u20134.8% of GDP, if the outbreak is contained within 3 to 6 months in PRC and the rest of the \nworld (best-case to worst-case scenario). Developing Asia is expected to incur 22%\u201336% of these \nlosses with aggregate impacts of 1.0%\u20132.2% of combined GDP.10 The risk of more severe \noutcomes, however, are substantial. The IMF estimates the global economy to contract sharply \nby 3.0% in 2020 and for the contraction to be more severe if the pandemic does not fade in the \nsecond half of 2020.11 The United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution \non COVID-19, co-sponsored by 188 nations, calling for intensified international cooperation to \ndefeat a pandemic that is causing \"severe disruption to societies and economies.\"12 Titled \u201cGlobal \nsolidarity to fight the COVID-19,\u201d it was the first resolution on the global pandemic to be adopted \nby any international organization. \n \n7.  Onset and consequences of the pandemic in the Kyrgyz Republic. On 17 March 2020, \na week after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global pandemic, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic  reported  its  first  three  COVID-19  cases.  The  outbreak  spread  quickly,  with  621 \nconfirmed cases (94 per million people), 22 new cases, and 8 deaths (1.2 per million people) as \nof 22 April 2020. On 24 March 2020, the Kyrgyz Republic, like its neighboring countries in the \nCAREC region, declared a state of emergency in accordance with the WHO guidelines on critical \npreparedness, readiness, and response actions.13 The MOH currently anticipates the pandemic \nto spread quickly before peaking in the second quarter of 2020. The capacity of the government \nand the overall health system to deal with the outbreak effectively is low without external \nassistance, and so, as an immediate first step, the country instituted drastic measures to prevent \nthe further spread of the pandemic\u2014closing its border with the PRC; imposing border restrictions \nwith Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan; imposing a lockdown on the population which entails restricting \nthe mobility of people, goods, and services (except for food and medical supplies), closing most \nbusinesses, shopping areas, and banks across the country; and suspending international and \n \n8  ADB. 2019.

The country has a total of 520 hospitals and centers, including 30 \nstate hospitals and 83 regional and inter-regional hospitals. There are 25,421 inpatient beds (41.9 \nbeds per 10,000 people), and 34,723 staff (21.9 physicians per 10,000 people). MOH has \ndesignated 24 quarantine hospitals and 441 observation sites (beds) and mobilized 29,502 health \nworkers  and  262  volunteers  to  work  in  COVID-19  zones.  However,  the  system  remains \nunderfunded, and the quality of care is substandard. Despite the lockdown, health services are \nbecoming overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients who also put other patients and health staff at \nhigh risk.  \n \nTable 2: Summary of Measures to Bring the COVID-19 Pandemic Under Control \nMeasure  Description \nPreparedness plan  The plan, developed with technical advice from the WHO, is based on a \nconservative estimate of 4,000 cases and focuses on limiting human-to-\nhuman transmission, including reducing secondary infections among close \ncontacts and health care workers, and mitigating the impact in-country should \nthere be sustained community transmission. \nSocial distancing  Social distancing is being enforced through the State of Emergency and \ncurfew. Travel outside homes are restricted during the curfew hours (from \n8:00 pm to 7:00 am) with the exception of trips to food stores, pharmacies, \nmedical institutions, and only if there is an identification document. When \noutside, it is compulsory to wear masks and to follow social distancing of at \nleast 1.5 meters. \nMedical personnel  At the beginning of February 2020, 92 doctors from Bishkek and Chui oblasts \nwere trained on clinical case management. MOH is still planning to conduct \ncascade trainings for health care workers in other oblasts under centralized \nleadership of WHO and with technical assistance provided by other agencies.  \nTest kits and equipment  76,000 rapid test kits have been procured or supplied, of which about 30,000 \nhave been used. \nRepurposing and  An additional 24 hospitals covering all oblasts have been selected to become \nbuilding of facilities  treatment centers for COVID-19, and 9 more may be mobilized to a total of \n33 hospitals. At the moment, these 33 facilities only have 226 ICU beds.  \nSuspension of air travel  There are no other commercial flights scheduled to leave from Kyrgyzstan. It \nis unclear when further flights will be announced. Only chartered flights \ncarrying returning citizens are allowed. All land borders have now been \nclosed. All foreign nationals are banned from  entering the country, including \nthose with Kyrgyz family members, and permanent residency holders. \nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, ICU = intensive care unit, MOH = Ministry of Health, WHO = World Health \nOrganization. \nSource: Government of Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n8.  Potential economic, health, and social impacts of the pandemic. The outbreak of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic weakened the macroeconomic outlook and opened a balance-of-payments \ngap estimated at about $405 million. Assuming that the impact from COVID-19 will last for the \nfirst half of 2020, real GDP growth would slow from 3.4% to 0.4%, inflation would increase from \n5.1% to 12.0%, and the current account deficit would widen from 12.0% to 14.5% of GDP (Figures \n1\u20134). This would create an external financing gap of 5.0% of GDP. The fiscal deficit would \nincrease from 1.1% to 7.8% of GDP and public debt would peak at 66.0% of GDP from 55.5%.14 \nThe pandemic has resulted in widespread job losses, particularly for those involved in the industry \nand service sectors (which account for 70% of all employment). The Ministry of Labor and Social \nDevelopment identified around 1.8 million people (about 30% of the population, that is, (i) persons \nliving below the poverty line (309,441 people), (ii) recipients of monthly social benefits, including \n \n14 IMF. 2020.

Moreover, the substantial decline in oil prices because of \nfalling demand for energy and the knock on effect on demand in major remittance source countries \nsuch as the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan, has amplified the impact of the pandemic on \nthe Kyrgyz economy. \n \nChart: Select Macro-Fiscal Indicators, incorporating likely COVID-19 Impact \nFigure 1: GDP Growth          Figure 2: Inflation \n%\n8 5-year movingaverage %\n12\n6 10 5-year movingaverage\n8\n4\n6\n4\n2\n2\n0 0\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 (f) 2021 (f)   2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 (f) 2021 (f)  \nFigure 3: Current Account Balance      Figure 4: Remittances \n% of GDP\n0\n$ billion 5-year moving average \n-5 2.4\n1.8\n-10\n1.2\n-15\n0.6\n5-year movingaverage\n-20 0.0\n  2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 (f) 2021 (f) 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 (f)2021 (f)  \n  \nBT = budget target, f = forecast, RF = revised forecast based on collections as at 21 March 2020. \nSources: National Statistical Committee and Ministry of Finance. \n \n9.

Analysis of the Coronavirus Impact on the Global Economy and Kyrgyz \nEconomy. Unpublished. Prepared for the Special Pandemic Taskforce under the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. \n ", "6 \nhand, IMF estimates the fiscal deficit to be larger and around 7.8% of GDP in 2020 (about $721 \nmillion), compared to the 2020 national budget target of 1.1% of GDP before COVID-19. ADB \nbelieves that the fiscal deficit could be even higher (about 12% of GDP) since the government \nwas yet to complete the cost estimates for its response plan when the IMF was finalizing its \nanalysis, and most of the increase in the deficit arises from the weakening of tax revenue \n(projected  losses  of  $362  million)  rather  than  additional  expenditure  to  finance  the \nresponses. Other significant downside risks include second-round effects from declining domestic \ndemand and consumption; continuing depreciation of the Kyrgyz som against the United States \ndollar (20% since January 2020, and after a long period of stability since mid-2016); and the \npossibility of a more protracted and intense crisis that would lead to a significantly larger economic \nlosses and budget deficit, and the need for further financing from development partners (footnote \n4). Maintaining fiscal space through measures to ensure new public expenditure programs are \nwell targeted and non-priority expenditures are reduced, and securing budget support from \ndevelopment partners while keeping within borrowing limits, will be critical. \n \n10.  Shock transmission channels. The macroeconomic impact of the pandemic will be \ntransmitted through shocks to external trade and remittances, as well as domestic supply and \ndemand\u2014in other words, multidimensional exogenous shocks. This will result in sector output, \nand fiscal and income (business and household) losses as follows (footnote 10):  \n(i)  Sector output losses. The current account deficit is projected to widen to 14.5% of \nGDP in 2020 (from 9.2% in 2019), because of a combination of lower remittances, and \nlower non-gold and services exports (i.e., tourism and transport). On the other hand, \nover the same period, healthy gold exports and falling imports (by 15%) because of \nclosure of the border with the PRC will lead to a slightly lower trade deficit. The \ngovernment estimates the following losses in 2020 as a result of the fall in demand \nand border closures: \na.  Garment manufacturing. The largest negative impact will be on clothing and \nfootwear production because imports of raw materials from the PRC account for \nabout 76.8% of total imports of raw materials. \nb.  Agriculture.  The  sector  is  forecast  to  contract  by  2.0%  compared  with  the \noriginally forecast growth of 3.7%. The Kyrgyz Republic imports only 2.7% of food \nproducts from the PRC so the border closure is expected to have a negligible \nimpact here. However, the decline in industrial goods could have a second-round \neffect  on  food  prices  in  terms  of  limited  availability  of  food  packaging  and \nequipment. \nc.  Tourism.  The  industry,  which  contributed  an  average  of  about  4.7%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s GDP from 2011 to 2018, is projected to be significantly affected as \ntourism revenues are closely linked to tourism arrivals (visitors from Kazakhstan, \nfor example, account for the biggest proportion of total arrivals, followed by those \nfrom the Russian Federation). The subsector of hotel and restaurant services is \nprojected to decline by 25% in 2020 as more and more international and domestic \ntourists, and business travelers, cancel trips. \n(ii) Fiscal losses. Most of the deficit widening will come from a weakening of tax revenue, \nalthough part of this performance can be attributed to an overoptimistic revenue \nassumption in the 2020 national budget: \na.  Revenue. Government revenue is projected to significantly decline in 2020 (by \n30% compared to the budget target). Tax collections from trade activity are \nexpected to be hit the hardest, declining by about 10.4% (trade tax), 9.7% (value-\nadded tax), 17.3% (excises on imported goods), and 20.3% (international trade \nand transaction taxes). Although some of the gaps can be attributed to the \noveroptimistic budget target, a comparison with actual revenue collected in 2019 \n ", "  7\nstill results in a sharp decline. It is worth noting that trade related taxes are a large \npart of total tax revenues, which help demonstrate as to why the border closures \nare having such a substantial impact on the economy. \n(iii) Income losses. Firms, especially SMEs that employ the most vulnerable and are \nprevalent in the informal sector, have been forced to close, or temporarily halt or \nreduce their activities. This has led to weakening business and consumer confidence \nand losses in employment and income. Private sector credit growth is projected to \ndecline from 14.9% in 2019 to 6.1% in 2020 as a result.17 The substantial decline in oil \nprices (down to $35 per barrel from a peak price of around $65 in January 2020) has \nresulted in a fall in remittances\u2014by 15% on a year-on-year basis (compared with \nMarch 2019) (footnote 11) on which most households in the Kyrgyz Republic rely.18  \n(iv) Curtailed Consumption. As a result of reduced economic activity and with decline in \nconsumption, ADB estimates suggest economic losses to the tune of 3.3% (with \nshorter containment measures) to 9.2% (with longer containment policies) of GDP.   \n \nB.  ADB Support Through COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option  \n11.  Detrimental exogenous shocks. Section A noted that the Kyrgyz Republic suffered a \nsevere decline in growth and is likely to experience another one in the near future. In addition, the \ncountry is likely to face substantial fiscal and financial stress. The fiscal deficit is estimated to \nreach at least 7.8% of GDP (footnote 14). The measures highlighted below (paras. 12\u201313 and 17) \nare part of the first phase of the government\u2019s overall COVID-19 pandemic response. A second \nphase of support will depend on how the situation evolves in the remainder of 2020. As highlighted \nin para. 4 and Table 1, the Kyrgyz Republic meets all of the access criteria of ADB\u2019s CPRO under \nthe Countercyclical Support Facility. The CPRO is the appropriate modality to support this \nresponse because it provides emergent liquidity into the national budget, and, in this sense, \ncreates more room (both fiscal and time) to develop more targeted support in the future should \nthis be necessary. \n \n12.  Countercyclical and health sector response plan.19 To respond to this substantial \nadverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government has developed a countercyclical and \nhealth sector response plan amounting to $248 million. The first part of the response is an overall \nhealth sector response that includes the $88 million health sector response plan. The second part \nis a $160 million countercyclical response plan to mitigate the impact on the poor and vulnerable, \nand safeguard productive sectors and SMEs from the economic downturn. In January 2020, the \ngovernment established a Special Pandemic Taskforce under the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, which \nis chaired by the vice-prime minister and supported by the Ministry of Finance (countercyclical \nresponse) and MOH (health sector response). Other key agencies such as the Ministry of \nEconomy and the Ministry of Labor and Social Development are also represented in the taskforce. \nThe taskforce has its own secretariat and reports to the vice-prime minister on a daily basis. \n   \n \n17 Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2020.

The COVID-19 Countercyclical and Health Sector Response Plan (Table 3) can be \nsummarized as follows: \n(i)  Support for the health sector response. A Disaster Response Coordination Unit \nwas  established  under  the  leadership  of  a  United  Nations  coordinator  as  a \nconsultative-deliberative  mechanism.  WHO,  United  Nations  agencies,  and  other \ndevelopment partners worked with MOH to develop the $88 million health sector \nresponse based on WHO technical guidelines, which recommend focusing on the \nfollowing key areas: coordination, risk communication and community engagement, \nsurveillance, points of entry, case investigation and rapid response, national laboratory \nsystem, infection prevention and control, case management and continuity of essential \nhealth  services  and  logistics  and  supply  management  (footnote  11).  Specific \nmeasures include (i) providing rapid response teams with equipment for training them \nin investigating cases and tracking contacts (including the purchase of phones, tablets, \nand computers) ($16.1 million); (ii) providing 24 hospitals designated for COVID-19 \nsurveillance and treatment with the necessary equipment for infection prevention and \ncontrol (e.g. thermostats, equipment for patient care, and sterilization equipment) \n($11.6 million); (iii) providing intensive care wards in 24 designated hospitals with the \nnecessary technical equipment for case management ($15 million); and (iv) procuring \nfully equipped ambulance vehicles ($2.4 million). These measures, while directly \ntackling the pandemic, also mitigate the risks faced by health workers. 83% of health \nand  social  sector  workers  are  women  (doctors,  nurses,  and  community  health \nworkers). Women are also the majority of health facility service staff working in areas \nsuch as cleaning, laundry and catering, and are more likely to be exposed to the virus. \nIn addition, MOH formed a pool of volunteers to work in COVID-19 zones, including \n170 physicians, 22 paramedics and nurses, 48 residents, and 22 students. Local \ncommunities and representatives of law enforcement agencies are involved in anti-\nepidemic  activities  such  as  raising  public  awareness  and  enforcing  mobility \nrestrictions.20 \n(ii) Support for the population and food security. To help the population withstand \nimpact of the pandemic on employment and household incomes (para. 10), the \ngovernment  introduced  price  controls  on  certain  categories  of  basic  foods  and \nexempted the import of flour and grain from value-added tax. The government is also \nproviding social assistance in the form of food packages for at least 311,000 vulnerable \nhouseholds, including women-headed households, totaling $11.4 million, and will \nmaintain social contribution payments ($6.8 million). ADB support is underway to help \ngovernment include sex- and age-disaggregated data, and information on occupations \nof household members, to the Ministry of Labor and Social Development\u2019s list of \nvulnerable households.21 \n \n20 The project team will coordinate with new and/or ongoing regional TA to promote information sharing with other \nCAREC member countries. \n21 ADB. 2018. Supporting Knowledge Solutions in Central and West Asian Countries. Manila. \n ", "  9\n(iii) Support for business entities. The relief measures that were offered include the \ndeferment of tax debts and social deductions ($11.8 million), and rent payments \n($900,000); the extension and restructuring of on-loans to SMEs by at least 3 months \n($8.5 million); and support for domestic suppliers, manufacturers, and contractors by \nadjusting public procurement contract deadlines that cannot be met under the state of \nemergency restrictions. The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR), the central \nbank, is also working on a package to support domestic producers and provide \nbenefits to domestic suppliers for public procurement contracts, and simplifying the \nlending procedures of the Russian-Kyrgyz Development Fund to improve access to \ncredit. The NBKR will also postpone the enactment of several financial regulations \nuntil further notice: (i) reduction of the liquidity ratio requirement to a minimum of 30% \n(from  the  current  45%);  (ii)  removal  of  liquidity  ratio  requirements  (7-day  and \novernight);  (iii)  lowering  the  minimum  threshold  level  for  mandatory  reserve \nrequirements from 80% to 70%; and (iv) in the event of arrears arising from COVID-\n19, option for banks or non-bank financial institutions not to worsen the classification \ncategory because of the financial condition of the borrower. Special attention will be \ngiven to those SMEs that are engaged in trade, especially in importing critical food and \nmedical supplies. \n(iv) Support for state budget stability. In addition to measures to compensate revenue \nlosses of $362 million, measures include protecting the 2020 budget allocation to MOH \n($240 million), and reducing capital expenditure and non-priority public expenditures \nsuch  as  overseas  travel and entertainment  allowances. Development  partners are \nbeing approached to provide budget support to finance the response plans. \n \n14.  Additional macroeconomic policy response. In addition to the above measures, the \nNBKR also raised the policy rate by 0.75 percentage points to 5.0% on 24 February 2020 to curb \ninflationary pressures due to the depreciation of the Kyrgyz Som. As the Kyrgyz Som experienced \na sharp depreciation from Som69.9 = $1.00 on 11 March 2020 to Som80.8 = $1.00 on 31 March \n2020, the NBKR maintained its policy of a managed floating regime for the exchange rate but \nindicated that it would intervene to smooth excess exchange rate volatility. It has already sold \n$202 million from foreign exchange reserves so far (40% more than total foreign exchange \ninterventions for 2019). \n \n15.  Debt sustainability. IMF\u2019s 2020 DSA of the Kyrgyz Republic indicate that even with the \nexpected spike of total public debt given the depreciation of the Kyrgyz som against the US dollar \nthe country remains at moderate risk of debt distress, with some space, around 3\u20134% of GDP (or \n$240 million to $320 million), for both external debt and overall public debt. Furthermore, ADB\u2019s \nDSA concludes that the proposed CARES program loan of $50 million represents only 1.5% of \nthe country\u2019s outstanding public debt stock of $4.65 billion. It will not significantly affect the debt \nratio, nor will it add significantly to the annual debt service obligations facing the government \n(footnote 2, Table 1, Appendix 4, Linked Document 4 and Linked Document 9). The expected \nexpenditures and borrowing to cover the 10% of GDP ($805 million) financing needs will not \nincrease the debt distress risk from moderate to high risk. This assessment is grounded on the \nexpectation that the government will strictly adhere to the fiscal rule of keeping the budget deficit \nat no more than 3.0% of GDP once the economy has fully recovered.22 The IMF emphasized that \nremaining cautious when contracting and guaranteeing new debt\u2014including by avoiding non-\nconcessional financing\u2014and improving public investment management would help reduce these \nvulnerabilities. As the proposed CPRO would be funded by Asian Development Fund grants and \n \n22 More details can be found in the Debt Sustainability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "10 \nconcessional ordinary capital resources (OCR) lending, it should not undermine the borrower\u2019s \ndebt sustainability.  \n \n16.  Development partner coordination. The proposed CARES program was prepared in \nclose coordination and consultation with other development partners. Coordination with the IMF \nhas been particularly strong. IMF\u2019s COVID related support was conditional on the government \nmobilizing ADB and other development partners\u2019 support. The IMF\u2019s Executive Board recently \napproved budget support of $241.8 million under the Rapid Financing Instrument and Rapid \nCredit Facility to help the Government of Kyrgyz Republic meet its urgent balance-of-payment \nneeds stemming from the COVID-19 outbreak (the first IMF emergency loan under these facilities \nworldwide since the outbreak of the pandemic). The IMF confirmed the need for additional support \nfrom ADB and other development partners on concessional terms to bridge the overall financing \ngap. ADB, together with the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, \nthe European Union, the IMF, the World Bank, WHO, United Nations agencies, and the United \nStates Agency for International Development, is an active member of the Development Partner \nCoordination Council which is responsible for facilitating the dialogue between government and \ndevelopment partners. In February 2020, the government reached out through the coordination \ncouncil to mobilize resources to help it manage the impact of the pandemic on the country. The \nWorld Bank approved a $12.15 million loan for the purchase of medical supplies and equipment \nas part of its COVID-19 response and will allocate $9.0 million from its ongoing Enhancing \nResilience in the Kyrgyz Republic Project to social protection measures.23 Other development \npartners have established crisis response facilities, but the specific support to the Kyrgyz Republic \nis yet to be defined. \n \n17.  Gender elements of the CARES program. Women are amongst the most vulnerable to \nthe adverse impact of the pandemic. Women are heavily represented in the health sector (87% \nof total workforce), services sector (57.6% of the workforce) and garment industry (majority of \nbusiness owners are women, about 70%\u201385%) that have been most affected by the economic \ndownturn. In addition, women head 30% of SMEs in the Kyrgyz Republic and make up 33% of \ntheir  workforces,  and  so  the  closure  of  these  businesses  have  displaced  many  women \nentrepreneurs and workers. Household incomes that have been impacted by the sharp fall in \nremittances will also have a more negative impact on women and children from the households \nwithout any alternative income sources. Limited access to food and products, may lead to \nnegative coping mechanisms in these households, such as consuming less food, and result in \nincreased susceptibility to infections and other health problems. ADB and other development \npartners are working with the government to make sure that its responses includes social \nprotection measures that proactively benefits women and girls. For example, food packages for \nvulnerable families (more than half of whom  are women-led) and accelerated procurement of \nproduct lines that are dominated by SMEs and employ a significant number of women. Additional \nmeasures  to  enhance  social  protection  measures  for  women  and  stimulating  livelihood \nopportunities  for  poor  women  entrepreneurs  are  being  developed  in  consultation  with \ndevelopment partners, including ADB. \n \n18.  Lessons  learned.  Because  exogenous  shocks  such  as  the  pandemic  can  disrupt \neconomic growth and put significant pressure on the fiscal position, mitigating such adverse \nimpacts is in line with ADB\u2019s institutional mandate. The preparation of the CARES program draws \nfrom ADB\u2019s past and recent engagement in similar programs and lessons learned in Kyrgyz \n \n23 More information on development partners\u2019 support for the government\u2019s pandemic response efforts: Development \nCoordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", " 11\nRepublic and elsewhere in the region.24 This experience and key lessons can be summarized as \nfollows: (i) importance of regular interaction with the government team. A regular (often daily) \ndialogue between the government team and the ADB team (comprising both headquarters and \nresident  mission  staff)  is  essential  to  building  trust  and  confidence,  data  and  information \ncollection, and cross-verification of analyses, and (ii) TA can facilitate the implementation of \ninternational best practices by tailoring responses to the crisis to the country\u2019s unique needs or it \ncould supplement government-led efforts through the provision of operational support and, where \nappropriate, capacity building \u201con-the-job\u201d.  \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB is a trusted partner for the Kyrgyz Republic in emergency \nresponse, public sector management, education, and infrastructure. 25 The proposed CARES \nprogram builds on a strong base of country knowledge and two decades of close collaboration. \nIn addition to ongoing policy dialogue on substantive and complex economic diversification \nreforms and TA to assess the socio-economic impact of the pandemic on the poor and vulnerable \n(footnote  15),  ADB,  together  with  other  development  partners,  is  working  closely  with  the \ngovernment in formulating COVID-19 response measures that are pro-poor and promote gender \nempowerment. For example, ADB is providing policy advisory support for SME development that \nbuilds on an ongoing policy-based loan and which is helping MOF develop measures that help to \npromote women-owned or -managed SMEs and help to address short-term liquidity pressures \nthrough the establishment of rapid credit facility.26  \n \n20.  The CARES program draws from the collaboration with the government and is part of a \ncomprehensive package of support to the Kyrgyz Republic, including immediate support in the \nform of (i) a $200,000 regional TA grant for the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund to procure \nemergency supplies including personal protective equipment, (ii) a coming $20 million emergency \nassistance grant and concessional loan to enhance clinical care facilities and case detection, (iii) \nand a joint ADB\u2013United Nations Development Programme socio-economic study of the impact of \nthe pandemic on the country\u2019s poor and vulnerable communities. In addition, ADB\u2019s Private Sector \nOperations Department circulated to the Ministry of Economy a summary of terms available to \nagribusiness industries that are eligible for fast-track processing because of the pandemic, and \nADB is preparing TA to help MOF develop a rapid diagnostic assessment of debt management in \nthe Kyrgyz Republic and to strengthen its institutional capacity for public debt management. In \nthe medium term, ADB will continue to support the government\u2019s efforts to diversify the economy \nand improve the country\u2019s resilience to shocks through structural reforms, such as stepping up \ntrade  and  investment  competitiveness,  the  SME  development,  public\u2013private  partnership \ninvestments, and modernization of the workforce by strengthening the institutional framework for \nmarket-driven skills. \n \nC.  Effects of Program and Outputs \n21.  The CARES program is designed to support the government\u2019s immediate priorities, which \nare to (i) contain the spread of the pandemic and social support, and (ii) provide a countercyclical \nresponse that safeguards productive sectors and SMEs and ensures that the economy is able to \n \n24 ADB. 2009.

Unless \nthe crisis is properly managed, conditions could lead to large declines in development expenditure \nand a substantial regress in health and education outcomes that would disproportionately impact \nthe poorest and most vulnerable segments of the population. The expected impact of the CARES \nprogram is: economic and social impacts of COVID-19 pandemic mitigated. The effect of the \nsupport  provided  under  the  CARES  program  will  be:  COVID-19  outbreak  more  effectively \nmanaged and its immediate adverse social and economic effects reduced.27 The financing under \nthe CARES program will (i) help create fiscal room to deploy much needed resources to the health \nsystem to contain the outbreak of the pandemic, (ii) mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic \non  the  poor  and  vulnerable  through  expanded  social  protection  programs,  (iii)  safeguard \nproductive sectors and SMEs from the economic downturn through fiscal measures to maintain \nemployment and incomes, and (iv) stabilize the national budget through review and reprioritization \nof urgent expenditure programs, and by raising revenue or rationalizing tax exemptions, and \nsecuring additional budget support.   \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n22.  Development financing needs. As Table 4 highlights, the countercyclical and health \nresponse plan will increase the government\u2019s fiscal deficit  from $722 million (7.8% of GDP mainly \ndue to a weakening of tax revenue) to $970 million (12.0% of GDP). However, the government \nintends to cap its fiscal expenditures at 10% of GDP ($805 million) to allow a less drastic reduction \nof the deficit in future years in line with its fiscal rules (footnote 14). \n \nTable 4: Urgent Financing Needs and Support 2020 ($ million) \n   2019  2020 Pre-COVID  2020 Post-COVID  2020 Post-COVID \nIMF Estimatesa  ADB Estimates \nRevenue  2,396  2,671  1,860  1,860  \nTaxes   1,741  2,073  1,429  1,429  \nInternational Trade Taxes  315  378  217  217  \nGrants  191  187  15   15  \nExpenditures  2,402  2,758  2,582  2,830  \nCurrent Expenditure  1,950  2,270  2,104  2,302  \nCapital Expenditure  451  488  478  528  \nFiscal Balance  -6  -87  -722  -970b \nFunding Gap        311.7 \nFinancing           493.7 \nADB:     \u2013  \u2013  120.0 \nCPRO     \u2013  \u2013  50.0 \nEAL     \u2013  \u2013  20.0 \nPBL     \u2013  \u2013  50.0 \nIMF     \u2013  \u2013  241.8 \nEFSD     \u2013  \u2013  100.0 \nEU     \u2013  \u2013  31.9 \nCOVID = coronavirus disease, CPRO = COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option, EAL = emergency assistance loan, \nEFSD = Eurasian Fund for Stabilization and Development, EU = European Union, PBL = policy-based loan. \na The IMF\u2019s projections as at 24 March 2020, which does not include its budget support.

The government is considering the following financing strategy in order to meet its public \nexpenditure needs: \n(i)  Securing budget support (preferably grants). As of 26 March 2020, the IMF Board \nof Directors has approved a total of $241.8 million in concessional lending. Other \ndevelopment partners that have confirmed the provision of support are ADB (potential \n$120 million support in concessional lending and grants including the $50 million \nCARES program, a $20 million emergency assistance loan health project and a \npotential $50 million policy-based loan program), the European Union (potentially \n$31.9 million in general and sector budget support grants), and the Eurasian Fund for \nStabilization and Development ($100 million loan). Securing these funds would reduce \nthe financing gap to $311.7 million. \n(ii) Reducing  2020  public  expenditure  program.  The  government  could  fill  the \nremaining gap by reducing its 2020 public expenditure program by $311.7 million. It \ncould consider programs such as subsidies to public corporations ($70 million) and \ncapital expenditure ($528 million), as well as reducing the size of non-priority items \nsuch as overseas travel and entertainment allowances.  \n(iii) Seeking partial financing from domestic financial market. The domestic debt \nmarket is still developing and although government plans to shift to more domestic \nfinancing in the medium term, it wishes to do this as part of a gradual transition rather \nthan an immediate action, which could potentially overwhelm the absorptive capacity \nof the sector and its two main holders of short-term public debt\u2014commercial banks \n(about 50% of public debt) and the social security fund (about 30%)\u2014and negatively \nimpact foreign exchange reserves.  \nThe timing and volume of financing is a major concern to government and so, in order to smooth \nout disbursements and ensure that it has funds throughout the rest of 2020, the government may \nwish to consider a combination of budget support, public expenditure reduction, and domestic \ndebt. \n \n24.  Budget support. The government\u2019s overall financing needs amount to $970 million (refer \nto Table 4). This consists of the revised fiscal deficit ($721 million) post-crisis and additional \nfinancing to fund the government\u2019s COVID-19 Countercyclical and Health Sector Response Plan \n($248 million). As highlighted in para. 15, the government\u2019s maximum expenditure ceiling is $805 \nmillion (10% of GDP)\u2014this is the amount that requires financing. The government requested (i) \na concessional loan of $25 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, and (ii) a grant not \nexceeding $25 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund), to help \nfinance the CARES program and to help the government meet its own financing requirements. \nThe CARES program will be funded by a portion of the performance-based country allocation in \nconcessional ordinary capital resources and Asian Development Fund grant and concessional \nlending  resources  from  the  regional  set-aside  following  some  reprogramming  and  some \nconcessional resources freed up from savings and cancelation of ongoing projects. This funding \nwill, in turn, supplement the budget support of $241.8 million already approved by the IMF (and \ncommitments  of  up  to  $251.9  million  from  other  development  partners)  to  help  fill  the \ngovernment\u2019s maximum countercyclical expenditure needs of $805 million for 2020. The ADB \nloan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per \nyear during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan and program agreements. \n  \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n25.  MOF will be the executing agency for the CARES program. The government, through MOF \nand MOH, and via oversight of the Special Pandemic Taskforce, will monitor (i) implementation \n ", "14 \nand effectiveness of government\u2019s countercyclical and health response plan, and (ii) execution \nand the flow of funds. Additional funding of an ongoing TA will be used to support program \nmanagement  activities  such  as  financial  management  and  reporting.  Government  and \ndevelopment partners recognize that implementation and monitoring and evaluation capacity in \nMOF and MOH will need to be significantly improved and that a coordinated approach to providing \nthis support is critical. However, this should not add to existing mechanisms for monitoring and \nevaluation given thin administrative capacities. The mechanism for supporting implementation \nand  financial  management  and  reporting  will  be  through  the  World  Bank-funded  Project \nImplementation Unit (PIU) located in the Foreign Investments Monitoring Division of MOF to \nsupport government to comply with its procurement and fiduciary requirements. The PIU has 6 \nexperienced staff (director, financial manager, procurement coordinator, contract administration \nspecialist, disbursement specialist, office-manager/procurement assistant) who are responsible \nfor financial management, disbursements, financial reporting and accounting, financial records \nmanagement, and managing annual audits. Discussions are underway with MOF to provide \nadditional support to the PIU so that it is able to take implementation and reporting support for \ngovernment\u2019s countercyclical and health expenditures. In addition, ongoing ADB TA will fund a \nfinancial management specialist to be based in MOF and serve as an additional resource for the \nPIU.28 The government, through the Special Pandemic Taskforce, will submit to ADB quarterly \nreports on expenditures made from the state budget to support the countercyclical and health \nmeasures including the progress towards achievement of targets and indicators in the Gender \nMonitoring Matrix, collecting and using sex-disaggregated data to guide policy development and \nfuture financing and to ensure that supported measures benefit both women and men. In addition, \nthe implementation arrangements provide for venues for dialogue for further refinements in the \nprogram design and implementation arrangement, and for developing the next phase response \nshould it be necessary. ADB will work through the Development Partner Coordination Council for \nsuch ongoing policy dialogue and coordination with government and development partners. The \ncoordination council will also be used to identify gaps and coordinate analysis required for \nanalytical, technical, and financial support. The CARES program implementation period is April \n2020\u2013December 2020. The proceeds of the loan and grant will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Governance \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith MOF. ADB completed a governance risk assessment in 2018 in line with the implementation \nguidelines of its Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan. The assessment found that \nthe country\u2019s public financial management and public procurement systems were functioning well \noverall. The functioning of the PFM system, in particular, has improved, especially as regards \nbudgeting, transparency, treasury functions, tax administration, debt management, financial \nreporting, and the legislative framework (new Budget Code). However, some weaknesses remain, \ne.g. in revenue forecasting, budget credibility, investment planning and estimation of recurrent \nexpenditures, off-budget funds, financial management information system, and internal and \nexternal audit, although these are being addressed through a 3-year World Bank and EU TA. The \npublic procurement system is overall relatively well-functioning, in particular as regards the \nlegislative  and  regulatory  framework  and  the  integrity  of  the  system.  However,  several \nweaknesses exist, including that procuring entities cannot undertake two-stage bidding and use \n \n28 ADB. 2018 Technical Assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic for Preparing the Promoting Economic Diversification \nProgram. Manila. \n ", " 15\nframework  agreements,  strategic  procurement  planning  is  not  undertaken,  procurement \nprocesses start late and payments to contractors and service providers is often late because of \ninadequate budgetary resources. Although corruption is perceived to be rather high and affecting \nall sectors of the economy as well as government, the prosecution of former ministers and civil \nservants has increased since 2018. The government, with support from development partners \nincluding ADB, the IMF, the World Bank, the European Union, the Department for International \nDevelopment of the United Kingdom, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, and \nthe United States Agency for International Development, are making a concerted effort to \novercome weaknesses in these areas through iterative reform strategies and action plans.29 \n \nB.  Poverty and Social \n27.  The Kyrgyz Republic ranked only 122 of 189 in the United Nations\u2019 Human Development \nReport 2019. It fares better in life expectancy and ranks second in years of schooling, but has a \nrelatively lower labor market participation rate and lower level of internet use. Further, poverty is \nunevenly distributed at 20.1% in urban areas, and 23.7% in rural areas. About 68% of the poor \nare found in rural areas, with Osh, Jalal-Abad, and Batken accounting for 60%. To cope, residents \nhave moved to informal jobs elsewhere in the country or emigrated to take low-skilled jobs. Due \nto the high level of male labor migration an increasing trend of households with female heads \nemerged. Such households are among those most susceptible to poverty. In addition, sustaining \nhigh growth and maintaining social protection initiatives in the national budget have come under \nsevere stress following the sharp decline in public revenues. The proposed CARES program is \nexpected to be followed by policy-based loans in 2020 and 2021 to help the government \nstrengthen fiscal and social protection resilience, and transform the economy into a diversified \nand dynamic economy that supports inclusive growth.30 \n \nC.  Gender \n28.  The CARES program\u2019s gender categorization is \u201ceffective gender mainstreaming.\u201d The \nCARES program plays a critical role in this context recognizing that in times of crises the poor \nand vulnerable groups\u2014women, children and youth, older persons, people with disabilities, \nmigrants, and ethnic groups\u2014are disproportionately impacted. Government initiatives supported \nunder the CARES program will help mitigate price and income shocks, especially to the vulnerable \npopulation and lagging regions. To protect the most food-insecure households, the government \nwill distribute food packages to the poor and vulnerable, prioritizing low-income households \nincluding: recipients of the monthly allowance for needy citizens (families) with children (52% of \nwhom are women); recipients of the monthly social allowance (people with disabilities, elderly \ncitizens, children who have lost their breadwinner/breadwinners who are not entitled to a pension) \n51% of whom are women; pensioners whose pension is lower than the cost of basic food basket \n(65% of pensioners are women31); as well as those households where the breadwinners suffered \nloss of income in industries gravely affected by the pandemic, such as the garments, tourism, and \nagriculture  industries\u2014sectors  with  significant  number  of  women  workers.  The  targeting \nmechanism for this support also includes women-headed households (37.6% of all households).32 \nAs women are responsible for food preparation and the families\u2019 overall nutrition, the provision of \nfood packs will ease women\u2019s burden.  \n \n29 ADB. 2018.

Since women make over 80% of frontline medical workers and will have to work longer \nshifts followed by the necessary observation, essential equipment, supplies and medicines have \nto be provided. To address specific women healthcare staff\u2019 needs, and to avoid higher level of \nexposure to infection among female doctors and nurses  appropriate and well-fitting individual \nprotective equipment, as well as menstrual kits as needed and in adequate number will be \nprovided to the front-line medical staff. The proposed CARES program complements an upcoming \nhealth sector emergency assistance loan that is being processed and which focuses on (i) \nenhancing national capacity in surveillance and response services, (ii) providing safe and quality \ninpatient care, (iii) providing gender sensitive support to frontline health workers at facility and \ncommunity levels, (iv) promote women\u2019s representation in leadership and decision making, and \n(v) address family violence that tends to increase during the self-isolation and quarantine.  The \nCARES program will support SMEs through tax reliefs and prolonged and restructured loans to \nhelp them recover, thus mitigating the loss of income of both women entrepreneurs (who own \n30% of SMEs) and women workers who predominantly make up the SME workforce. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n30.  Following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the CARES program is classified \ncategory C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Program \nactivities will be confined to policy and institutional reforms. No activity will result in or lead to \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  or  negatively  affect  indigenous  peoples  or  the  environment.  ADB \nproceeds will not be used for any activities resulting in physical or economic displacement as \ndefined by the ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. It is understood that expenditure reports from \nMOF should be confirming this as well. \n \n31.

Additional indicators to measure the effects will be identified at a later stage and \nused to report on the program\u2019s effectiveness as comprehensively as possible in the project completion report. \nPossible indicators include, the reduction of COVID-19 spreading rates and number of cluster outbreaks; share of \nSMEs which benefited support measures that are still in business, and food consumption of poor households \nretained at or close to pre-COVID-19 levels. \nc  This includes women-headed households, as well as those households whose breadwinners lost their jobs in the \ngarments, tourism, and agriculture industries (sectors with significant women workers). \nd  According to NSC in 2019, 37.6% of all households are headed by women. \ne  These include, among others, proper fitting PPEs, goggles, face masks and shields, and diapers and menstrual kits, \nas necessary. \nf  Health workers, including women health workers, provided with transportation to and from their work, during the \nperiod of the pandemic. \ng  83.2% of health and social sector workers are women (doctors, nurses and community health workers), they are also \nthe majority of health facility service-staff \u2013 such as cleaners, laundry, catering and as such they are more likely to \nbe exposed to the virus.  \nh  30% of SMEs are women-owned, and that these SMEs predominantly employ women.   \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n ", "  Appendix 2  21 \n \nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=54169-001-3  \n1.

Adverse impact of exogenous  The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the Kyrgyz economy to sustain \nshocks  growth,  maintain  resilience  in  the  face  of  adverse  external  shocks  and  weather  the \ncontagion effects of the global pandemic. The outbreak spread, with 449 confirmed cases \n(69 per million people), 19 new cases, and 5 deaths (0.8 per million people) as of 17April \n2020.  However,  the  government\u2019s  well-placed  and  timely  interventions  enabled  the \neconomy to respond to post-crises emergency needs swiftly and efficiently. \n \nThe government\u2019s prudent macroeconomic management policies, focusing on cushioning \nthe effects of the pandemic, supporting confidence and economic growth, have been \nbacked by the IMF\u2019s emergency assistance program in the amount of $241.8 million. \n \nAssuming that the impact will last for the first half of 2020, real gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth is expected to slow from 3.4% to 0.4% due to a strong decline in service jobs. \nInflation would increase from 5.1% to 12.0% on the back of currency depreciation (20% \nsince January 2020) and higher imported inflation. The rise in inflation is related to currency \ndepreciation and high income inequality. The Gini index by expenditure stood at 27.7 in \n2018 which is high. High income inequality translates into an asymmetric distribution of \nfunds and leads to non-uniform consumption. This builds pressures on the foreign exchange \nmarket  and  contributes  to  the  depreciation  of  local  currency  resulting  in  mounting \ninflationary pressures. The current account deficit would widen  from 9.2% to 14.5% of GDP \nbecause of a combination of reduced remittances, and decreased non-gold and services \nexports (i.e., tourism and transport). Without remittances, which comprise 29.0% of GDP, \nmore than the export receipts, the poverty level is expected to rise by almost 10 percentage \npoints to 32.2%. The tumbling oil prices impacting the Russian economy have already \nresulted in a 15% decrease in remittances. \n \nAlthough income poverty and broader measures of deprivation in the Kyrgyz republic have \nfallen dramatically over the past two decades, a large proportion of the population still \nremains vulnerable. In addition, while multidimensional poverty (which goes beyond income \npoverty to encompass health, education and broader living standards), has fallen over the \nyears, it still remains high. Lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation affects a \nsizable proportion of poor and non-poor households. \n ", "26  Appendix 4 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \n   \n  \nMost poor individuals lack access to social assistance and income inequality (with a Gini \ncoefficient at 27.7 in 2018) remains high. The fiscal framework attempts to reduce inequality \nbut has limited impact on poverty. Even among the poorest decile, tax payments equal more \nthan 25% of expenditure with the poor bearing the brunt of indirect taxes (for example, \nvalue-added-tax). Realigning the tax framework toward direct taxes could make the tax \nsystem more progressive but this approach risks increasing the informal sector, which is \nalready high (accounting for 71.8% of total employment). \n \nThe subsector of hotel and restaurant services is projected to decline by 25% in 2020 \ncontributing to joblessness. The fiscal deficit would increase from 1.1% to 7.8% of GDP and \npublic debt would peak at 66% of GDP from 55.5%. Government revenue is projected to \ndecline in 2020 by 30% compared to the budget target. There may also be second-round \neffects from declining domestic demand and consumption.  \n \nCOVID-19 will affect the economy through multiple transmission channels such as trade, \ntourism, remittances, and FDI. The Kyrgyz republic, being an oil-importing country, is likely \nto benefit from lower oil prices. The government estimated loss in imports in the amount of \n$745 million (8.8% of GDP) and loss in exports of $124 million (1.5% of GDP). This amounts \nto an improvement in net exports of $621 million (7.4% of GDP) that may impact positively \non the merchandise trade, but will negatively impact revenues from trade. \n \nEven though, the Kyrgyz service sector is well diversified beyond the hospitality industry, a \ncomprehensive ban on travel is likely to have a significant impact on the economy. The data \non earnings from cross-border travel in the CAREC region indicate that export earnings \namounted to $438 million, a smaller amount compared with $2.3 billion for Kazakhstan, for \nexample. The government estimates that hotel and restaurant services are to be projected \nat 75% of the past capacity because tourists are canceling trips due to a pandemic, and \ntourism industry representatives report losses. \n \nRemittances  generally tend  to  be  more  stable  and  less  sensitive  to external  shocks \ncompared with e.g. FDI which tend to be more volatile. The government estimates that a \ndecline in remittances, with the portion that would be spent in the economy (rather than \nhoarded), will amount to a loss on aggregate demand of $100 million (1.1% of GDP). The \n ", "Appendix 4  27 \n \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \n   \ngovernment estimates that if there was a complete withdrawal of FDI for the full year, taking \ninto account the prevailing incremental capital-output ratio, the loss would amount to $42.2 \nmillion or about 0.5% of GDP. \n2.  Counter cyclical development  The government\u2019s countercyclical program  is designed to alleviate revenue shortfalls in the \nexpenditures  business sector and to ensure higher public spending on the liquidation of the effects of the \n  pandemic including addressing rising healthcare costs.  \n \nPriority Action Plan of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic to Ensure Economic and \nSocial Stability for 2020 in Connection with COVID-19 comprises: (i) support for the \npopulation and food security, (ii) support for the health sector response, (iii) support for \nbusiness entities, and (iv) support for state budget stability.  \n \nThe government introduced administered prices on certain categories of basic foods and \nexempted the import of flour and grain from value-added tax. The government is also \nproviding social assistance in the form of food packages for at least 311,000 vulnerable \nhouseholds,  including  women  headed  households,  totaling  to  $11.4  million,  and  will \nmaintain social contribution payments ($6.8 million). WHO, United Nations agencies, and \nother development partners worked with MOH to develop the $88 million health sector \nresponse based on WHO technical guidelines. Protecting the 2020 budget allocation to \nMOH ($240 million), and reducing capital expenditure and non-priority public expenditures \nsuch as overseas travel and entertainment allowances have been implemented. The \ngovernment has taken steps to provide the banking system with adequate levels of liquidity \nin local currency to support lending to the economy. To ensure maximum access to credit \nfunds, the government eased prudential requirements for commercial banks and Non-\nfinancial Commercial Organizations. The provision of soft loans together with interest and \nprincipal payment restructuring schemes on bank loans for borrowers will support economic \nactivity. Other relief measures that were offered include the deferment of tax debts and \nsocial deductions ($11.8 million), and rent payments ($900,000) while safeguarding state \nbudget stability; the extension and restructuring of loans to SMEs at least 3 months ($8.5 \nmillion); and support for domestic suppliers, manufacturers, and contractors by adjusting \npublic procurement contract deadlines that cannot be met under the state of emergency \nrestrictions. \n ", "28  Appendix 4 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \n   \n3.  Pre-shock  record  of  generally  The government\u2019s sound economic policy management and strategy to support economic \nsound  macroeconomic  growth through prudent macro and fiscal policy settings helped maintain robust economic \nmanagement  activity and continued buoyancy in the private sector in the pre-crisis period. Economic \ngrowth stood at 4.5% in 2019, driven by improved remittances and gold production and \nexports. Inflation at 1.1% was under the target range of 5-7% with currency strength and \nfood imports. The current account deficit hovered at 9.3% of GDP with higher gold exports \nhelping to offset the boost in infrastructure-related imports. The budget deficit remained at \n0.1% of GDP, well below 3.0% of GDP, and was in line with the fiscal rule adopted by the \ngovernment of stabilizing public debt at 54% of GDP by 2024. At the end of December 2019, \nthe macroeconomic outlook was positive. The 2019 Asian Development Outlook Update \nprojected economic growth of 4.0% in 2020, driven by improved remittances and gold \nproduction and exports. Inflation was forecast to moderately increase as a consequence \nfrom 2.0% to 3.5%. The current account deficit was projected to hover at about 12% of GDP \nwith higher gold exports helping to offset the boost in infrastructure-related imports. A higher \nbudget deficit compared to 2017 and 2018 was targeted but was expected to remain below \n3.0% of GDP and was in line with the fiscal rule. Poverty and inequality levels have been \nalso been gradually declining, with poverty incidence of 25% in 2019 compared with 30% \nin 2015. At the end of the 2019 Article IV Consultations in July 2019, IMF concluded that \nthe country had made progress toward macroeconomic and financial stability as evidenced \nby low inflation, lower fiscal deficits, and a stable banking industry. However, it warned that \nthe  economy  remained  vulnerable  to  external  shocks  given  its  heavy  reliance  on \nremittances and gold exports, the composition of its public debt (most of it external) and the \nlevel of the current account deficit. In addition, the IMF cautioned that economic growth had \nnot been sufficient to significantly raise living standards and reduce poverty.  \n \n4. Structural reforms  The government acknowledges that it needs to accelerate efforts to achieve sustained and \ninclusive growth, prepared a comprehensive structural reform program that would include \nmeasures to step up trade and investment competitiveness, development of SMEs, and \npublic investment management. It is implementing a comprehensive agenda of structural \nreforms aimed at fostering macroeconomic stability and diversifying the economy to enable \nfaster and sustained economic growth, employment generation, and poverty reduction.  \n \nThe  government-supported  measures  aim  to  step  up  trade  and  investment \ncompetitiveness,  development  of  SMEs,  and  public  investment  management.  The \n ", "Appendix 4  29 \n \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \n   \ngovernment is investing in preparedness and strengthening the health system against \nCOVID-19 will not only address the direct health impact but will also help to mitigate the \nbroader socioeconomic costs of the pandemic. \n5. Debt sustainability  The IMF\u2019s 2020 DSA of the Kyrgyz Republic indicates that the country remains at moderate \nrisk of debt distress, with some space, around 3\u20134% of GDP (or $240 million to $320 \nmillion), for both external debt and overall public debt, and despite the expected spike of \ntotal public debt to 66% of GDP in 2020 in response to COVID-19 and the depreciation of \nthe som against the US dollar. Furthermore, ADB\u2019s DSA concludes that the proposed \nCARES program loan of $50 million represents only 1.5% of the country\u2019s outstanding \npublic debt stock of $4.65 billion. It will not significantly affect the debt ratio, nor will it add \nsignificantly to the annual debt service obligations facing the Government. The expected \nexpenditures and borrowing to cover the 10% of GDP ($805 million) financing needs will \nnot increase the debt distress risk from moderate to high risk. This assessment is grounded \non the projection that the government will strictly adhere to the fiscal rule of keeping the \nbudget deficit at no more than 3.0% of GDP once the economy has fully recovered. Its \ncurrent debt-carrying capacity is assessed as strong; however, the debt outlook remains \nvulnerable to shocks to real GDP growth and exports. \n \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  debt-carrying  capacity  is  assessed  as  strong.  The  country\u2019s \nComposite Indicator (CI) index is 3.19, above the threshold of 3.05 for strong debt carrying \ncapacity.  This translates into the following external debt burden thresholds: 240% of the \npresent value (PV) of external debt-to-exports ratio, 55% of the PV of external debt-to-GDP, \n21% of the PV of external debt service-to-exports, and 23% of the PV of debt service-to-\nrevenue. The total public debt burden threshold is 70% of the PV of total public debt-to-\nGDP ratio. \n6.  Coordination with  the  The CARES program was developed in close coordination and consultation with the IMF.  \nInternational Monetary Fund  Coordination and collaboration with the IMF has been particularly strong. ADB has closely \n  coordinated  with  IMF  on  the  macroeconomic  situation,  COVID-19  impact  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s financing needs. IMF\u2019s assessment is provided through IMF Country Report \nNo. 20/90 of March 2020 (see Linked Document 4). In this report, the IMF also concluded \nthat the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s macroeconomic and financial sector performance in 2019 was \nbroadly sound. Based on their analyses, real GDP growth increased to 4.5% in 2019 due \nto a pickup of both gold and non-gold output. The output gap was closed but both headline \nand core inflation remained well below the inflation target range (5\u20137%). The current \n ", "30  Appendix 4 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \n   \naccount deficit narrowed to 9.3% of GDP in 2019 (compared to 12.3% in 2018), driven by \nboth higher gold exports and lower imports. Gross official reserves stabilized at 3.9 months \nof imports of goods and services, reflecting  the net impact of purchases of locally produced \ngold offset partly by foreign exchange sales. The budget deficit of the general government \ndecreased to 0.1% of GDP in 2019, and, as a result, public debt decreased to 54% of GDP. \nThe banking sector is well capitalized and liquid but exposed to foreign exchange risk due \nthe still high level of dollarization. The banking system\u2019s average capital adequacy ratio \namounted to 22% in January 2020, the ratio between liquid assets and liabilities (69%) is \nwell  above  the  minimum  required  (45%),  while  the  non-performing  loan  (NPL)  ratio \nincreased  slightly  to  8.1%,  mainly  due  to  an  increase  in  NPLs  from  mortgages  and \nconstruction.  While  banks\u2019  direct  exposure  to  foreign  exchange  risk  is  low,  indirect  \nexposure via the foreign exchange risk of unhedged borrowers, who earn revenue in KGS \nbut carry debt in US$ and make up about 25% of total loans and two thirds of foreign \nexchange loan, is higher. \nCARES = COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, DSA = Debt Sustainability Analysis, GDP = gross domestic \nproduct, IMF = International Monetary Fund, WHO = World Health Organization. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "Asian Development Bank", "CreationDate": "D:20200427140808+08'00'", "Creator": "PDF24 Creator", "Keywords": "kyrgyzstan, covid-19, coronavirus, covid-19 pandemic, adb covid-19 response, countercyclical support facility, cares program, public health, 54169-001, adb project, terms and conditions, board approval, rrp, approved projects, recommendations of the president", "ModDate": "D:20200505134508+08'00'", "Producer": "GPL Ghostscript 9.14", "Subject": "The proposed CARES program is part of an integral package of support to help the government\u2019s immediate efforts to mitigate the significant negative health, social, and economic impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nThe report and recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors (RRP) document describes the terms and conditions of a project for consideration and approval by ADB's Board of Directors.\r\n\r\nThis document dated April 2020 is provided for the ADB project 54169-001 in Kyrgyz Republic.", "Title": "COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program: Report and Recommendation of the President"}, "author_page": " \n \nVice-President  Shixin Chen, Operations 1 \nDirector General  Werner E.
