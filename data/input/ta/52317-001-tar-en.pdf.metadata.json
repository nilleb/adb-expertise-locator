THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  Rationale \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has had a fruitful partnership with Uzbekistan on \nurban development for two decades, particularly in the water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector, \na relationship which is deepening and expanding in scope, both on project finance and sector \nreforms.  Achievements  have  been  accomplished  in  utility  management,  water  quality \nmanagement, and financial sustainability. Extensive experience has been gained in effective \nproject  design  and  implementation.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  has  been  closely  aligned  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s evolving development priorities, to improve living conditions, create a sustainable \nenvironment, and strengthen economic competitiveness. To date, more than 5 million residents \n(more than 15% of the population) are benefitting from the assistance. Since 1997, ADB has \nprovided loan financing of more than $700.0 million for eleven investment projects in the sector, \nand grant funding of $2.5 million for sector enhancement (Appendix 4). \n \n2.  Significant development challenges remain. Despite strong economic growth,1 which is \nparticularly attributable to urban areas, the country suffers from persistent WSS service limitations \nin both urban and rural areas. The nation\u2019s Soviet-era centralized wastewater systems are \ndilapidated and as a result, vast quantities of untreated wastewater are discharged into rivers, \nsurface impoundments, and groundwater resources. Surface water pollutants often far exceeds \nmaximum  allowable  concentrations.  Networks  and  treatment  facilities  need  immediate \nrehabilitation.  These  deficiencies  have  resulted  in  WSS  service  inequalities,  environmental \ndeterioration, and public health threats, in turn causing constrained economic growth. Traditional \nseparation of gender roles where women are primarily responsible for domestic chores results in \nwomen\u2019s poverty, and the lack of reliable WSS service increases this burden. Urban areas already \nface the challenges of having aging public infrastructure, unreliable public services, and limited \nfinancial resources now face additional stress due to rapid population growth.  \n \n3.  ADB will apply a comprehensive and programmatic approach to develop more integrated \nurban development solutions. The transaction TA facility will provide project preparation support \nto a series of ensuing projects, comprising: (i) Tashkent Province Sewerage Improvement Project \n($160 million); (ii) Uzbekistan Water Supply and Sanitation Development Program ($200 million)2; \n(iii) Uzbekistan Integrated Urban Development Project ($200 million); and (iv) Uzbekistan Solid \nWaste Management Development Project ($150 million) (Appendix 3). The transaction TA facility \nwill support improvement of WSS and other public services through technical, policy, and capacity \ndevelopment, in both urban and rural areas. Uzbekistan now has stronger country systems and \ncapacity and using the principle-based sector program approach will give the country a greater \nsense of ownership. An integrated approach will be applied to the development of economic \ngrowth clusters with stronger urban rural linkages. Support in these areas, including tourism \ndevelopment, will cover urban planning and management, urban rural linkages and provision of \npublic services, cultural heritage protection, information and communications technology, public-\n                                                \n1   Uzbekistan is one of Central West Asia\u2019s fastest growing economies, and aspires to become an upper-middle-income \nnation. Its gross domestic product has grown consistently at over 7% annually to 2016, and growth is predicted at \nover 5% annually through to at least 2019. Strategic investments in local infrastructure are considered essential to \nmeet national development objectives. \n2  Results-Based Lending (RBL) and Sector Development Program (SDP) modalities are being explored for the \nprogram. ", "2 \n \nprivate partnership arrangements, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) and women \nbusiness enterprise (WBE) development. \n \n  2.  Program of Ensuing Projects  \n \n4.  Programmatic approach for urban development. Following ADB\u2019s earlier support in the \nWSS sector, the government has emphasized the need for ADB support through a strategic and \ncoordinated sequence of projects, that would create synergy between investments and technical \nassistance, strengthening the impact of the proposed assistance. The approach will focus on \npriority interventions that will target the key WSS and urban development issues. It will contain \ninnovative features, including high technology applications, and advancing the readiness for \npublic-private partnership arrangements. This approach will ensure that ADB\u2019s investments will \nplay a catalytic role in the government\u2019s broader urban development program. \n \n5.  Ensuing Projects. The support is broadly based. It includes project loans and TA to                     \n(i) improve the urban services and environment; (ii) to make cities in Uzbekistan more liveable \nwith better public service; and (iii) to stimulate inclusive and sustainable economic growth through \nintegrated  approach  and  strengthened  urban  rural  linkages,  rehabilitated  and  upgraded \ninfrastructure and strengthened institutional and management capacity (Table 1).   \n   \nTable 1: Program of Ensuing Projects \nEnsuing Projects    Description \nTashkent Province Sewerage  The project will upgrade the centralized wastewater systems in six cities and one \nImprovement Project   urban center by rehabilitating/upgrading six existing wastewater treatment plants \nand rehabilitating/expanding sewer coverage. It will also improve sanitation \npractices in rural areas, and strengthen management and operational capacity of \nTashkent Provincial Suvokova (TPS). The project is consistent with the ADB \nWater Operational Plan 2011\u20132020,3 and the ADB Country Operations Business \nPlan, 2018\u20132020 for Uzbekistan.4 It also aligns with previous and ongoing ADB-\nfunded WSS sector projects in Uzbekistan and contributes to the attainment of \nSustainable Development Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation. The project \nimpacts are environment, health and living conditions in Tashkent Province \nimproved. The project outcome: access to reliable, sustainable and affordable \nwastewater services improved and expanded in the project area. The total \nestimated cost is $185.0 million. The government has requested ADB for a $160.0 \nmillion loan which is included in ADB\u2019s lending pipeline for 2019.  \nUzbekistan Water Supply and  The project will support part of a national WSS development program. ADB will \nSanitation Development  support several investments of the fourteen regional water companies in the \nProgram  northeastern part of the country. The primary investments are to be selected from \nthe following: (i) replacement of pumps for improved energy efficiency; (ii) \ninstallation of production meters; (iii) installation of water meters (targeting \n100%); (iv) reduction of inflow/infiltration in sewer networks; (v) equipment for \nwater quality monitoring; (vi) nonrevenue water reduction; and (vii) hydrological \nmodelling. ADB funding, as a portion of investments of the national program, is \nestimated at $200 million.   \nUzbekistan Integrated Urban  The project will focus primarily on environmentally-sustainable, socially inclusive, \nDevelopment Project  and integrated urban development in selected cities, with investments in key \nmunicipal infrastructure and services, SME promotion and development, and \nenvironmental management for improved livability in the cities. The project will \nalso improve capacity in urban planning, utility management, ICT, and PPP. The \nproject is to be funded by ADB at an estimated cost of $200 million.  \n                                                \n3   ADB. 2011. Water Operational Plan 2011-2020. Manila.
