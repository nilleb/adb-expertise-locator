Strategy 2020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) identified partnerships as one of \nthe five drivers of change that would help ADB realize its vision of \u201can Asia and Pacific free of \npoverty.\u201d1 ADB  recognizes  that  civil  society  participation  helps  improve  the  quality  of  its \ndevelopment services.2 ADB\u2019s 1998 policy, Cooperation Between Asian Development Bank and \nNongovernment Organizations (NGOs), established a broad framework of cooperation between \nADB and NGOs and committed ADB to engage with and seek the participation of NGOs.3 To \nsupport the implementation of this policy, ADB established the NGO Center in 2001, later \nrenamed  the  NGO  and  Civil  Society  Center  (NGOC),  and  also  created  a  civil  society \norganization (CSO) Cooperation Network consisting of staff focal points (CSO anchors) for civil \nsociety  cooperation  across  ADB\u2019s  relevant  headquarters-based  departments,  regional \ndepartments, and resident missions. 4 Periodically, the NGOC has developed work plans of \nADB\u2019s formal activities to strengthen engagement and partnership with CSOs. 5 The project \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.6  \n2.  In 2009, the NGOC completed a 10-year review of ADB\u2019s Cooperation with NGOs policy \nand  put  forward  lessons  and  recommendations  for  further  implementation.7 ADB\u2019s  CSO \nCooperation  Network meetings  in  2012  and  2013  identified  the  need  to  develop  technical \nassistance (TA) to support the implementation of ADB\u2019s Cooperation with NGOs policy through \ndeepening and expanding civil society participation in ADB\u2019s policy, programs, and projects.8   \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  CSOs  were  formally  recognized  internationally  for  the  first  time  as  independent \ndevelopment actors in their own right at the Third High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness at \nAccra in 2008. This was a significant advancement in situating the distinctive contributions of \nCSOs to development and making them essential partners in the development process. CSO \nparticipation in service delivery and advocating for development has contributed to meeting the \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132010.   \nManila. \n2  ADB. 2009. Civil Society Organization Sourcebook:  A Staff Guide to Cooperation with Civil Society Organization.  \nManila.  Civil society organizations (CSOs) are non-state actors whose aims are neither to generate profits nor to \nseek governing power. CSOs unite people to advance shared goals and interests.  They have a presence in \npublic life, expressing the interests and values of their members or others, and are based on ethical, cultural, \nscientific, religious, or philanthropic considerations. CSO Participation is the process of engaging stakeholders \ninfluence or contribute to designing, implementing, and monitoring development activity. \n3  ADB. 1998. Cooperation Between Asian Development Bank and Nongovernment Organizations.  Manila. The \nterm  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  has  been  replaced  with  CSO  to  reflect  the  broad  range  of \nnongovernment organizations and other civic bodies with whom ADB interacts. \n4  The name change to NGO and Civil Society Center represents the same shift described in footnote 3.   \n5  ADB. ADB\u2013CSO Cooperation Work Plan, 2013\u20132016. Manila. Unpublished. CSOs unite people to advance \nshared goals and interests. They have a presence in public life, expressing the interests and values of their \nmembers or others, and are based on ethical, cultural, scientific, religious, or philanthropic considerations. CSOs \ninclude  NGOs,  professional  associations,  foundations,  independent  research  institutes,  community-based \norganizations, faith-based organizations, people\u2019s organizations, social movements, and labor unions.   \n6  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 November 2013.  \n7  The review included: ADB. Lessons and Recommendations from Ten Years of Implementing ADB\u2019s Policy on \nCooperation with NGOs. Manila. Unpublished. It also included regional dialogues with NGO anchors and an \nNGOC strategic planning exercise. \n8   A reconnaissance mission to inform the TA was fielded to Cambodia to seek input from government project \nimplementation unit staff, consultants, and CSOs that are jointly implementing the Second Rural Water Supply \nand Sanitation Sector Project and the Emergency Food Assistance Project.  Cambodia was identified by CSO \nanchor as a country with some good examples of CSO cooperation in operation.   \n ", "2   \nMillennium Development Goals objectives because of (i) the ability of CSOs to use social and \nmass media to mobilize dialogue and action for their causes, (ii) the extensive international and \nlocal reach of CSOs, and (iii) the agility and willingness of CSOs to take advantage of new \ntrends and seek new and innovative ways to alleviate poverty. \n \n4.  CSOs  are  now  recognized  as  having  a  vital  role  in  providing  services  that  are \ncomplementary  to  those  provided  by  governments  and  private  sector  actors,  especially  in \nregions  where  government  presence  is  fragile  and  weak. 9 Civil  society  participation \nfundamentally supports good governance, citizenship, and accountability. It promotes equitable \ngrowth through social inclusion of the poor, women, and other marginalized groups.10 In general, \nthe Asia and Pacific region has a long tradition of active civil society in social services and is \nhome to well-established and major CSOs. \n \n5.  The role of young people\u2019s participation in development has recently changed with the \nadvent of social media, which has contributed to the growth of youth organizations among new \nand emerging CSOs. The population of young people worldwide rose to 1.21 billion in 2010, \nfrom 461 million in 1950. 11  Asia has the largest number of young people, 754 million.12 \nRecognizing the potential of youth in development, the World Bank, International Monetary \nFund, and the United Nations actively engage youth.13 \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 identified partnerships as one of the five drivers of change, noting, \n\u201cPartnerships with international development agencies, multilateral and bilateral institutions, the \nprivate sector, NGOs, community-based organizations, and foundations will become central to \nplanning, financing, and implementing ADB operations.\u201d14  \n \n7.  The Independent Evaluation Department of ADB consistently attributes a high value to \ncivil  society  participation  and  the  continuing  need  to  strengthen  and  mainstream  the \nparticipation of CSOs in ADB operations. ADB pursues cooperation with CSOs to (i) incorporate \ninnovations,  knowledge,  and  approaches  in  ADB  services;  (ii)  strengthen  effectiveness  in \ndelivering development results; and (iii) ensure sustainability of such results. \n \n8.  CSOs are insufficiently engaged by both ADB and ADB developing member countries \n(DMCs)  in  development  projects.  Despite  ADB's  commitment  to  improve  engagement  and \npartnerships with stakeholders, some of its projects and programs have been subject to criticism \nfrom CSOs that have raised issues and concerns. Recent research revealed that about 60% of \nissues  and  concerns  raised  by  CSOs  on  ADB  projects  were  related  to  inadequate \ncommunication and participation.15 ADB perception surveys show that CSOs consistently rate \nADB\u2019s performance below the average rating given by other non-CSO stakeholders responding \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2009.

Unpublished. \n ", "  3 \nto the survey, demonstrating they are more dissatisfied than these other groups. 16 Moreover, \nDMCs tend to view CSOs as competitors in development, missing the opportunity to harness \ninnovative, cost-effective, and inclusive practices. These reasons highlight the importance of \nimproving civil society participation in program and project planning, design, and implementation.   \n \n9.  The modality through which ADB harnesses NGO engagement depends on the broader \ncontext of government\u2013CSO relations and entry points provided by ADB operations. Some of \nthe challenges to facilitating better partnerships with CSOs include the following: (i) DMC clients \nand ADB staff lack the time, resources, or experience to engage with CSOs during project \nplanning and design; (ii) there is a lack of perceived added value of CSO participation; (iii) \ninsufficient  outreach  and  mechanism  to  engage  CSOs  in  knowledge  sharing  events;  (iv) \ninadequate knowledge products and a need to increase consultation and participation activities \nwith CSOs and DMCs; and (v) ADB does not utilize partnerships as effectively as it could.17 \n   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be strengthened development effectiveness resulting from \ngreater CSO engagement. Increasing meaningful engagements among ADB, CSOs, and DMCs \nin ADB-financed projects will contribute to more projects completed with enhanced development \nresults.  Involving  more  CSOs  in  ADB-financed  projects  can  help  improve  development \noutcomes  and  sustainability,  contributing  to  fewer  project  issues  and  concerns,  and  more \npeople participating in and benefiting from the development projects. \n \n11.  The outcome of the TA will be increased civil society contribution in ADB operations. \nMeaningful  participation  will  be  incorporated  in  country  partnership  strategies  (CPSs)  and \nproject design and implementation. Indicators and targets for achievement are (i) all CPS and \nrelevant  sector  assessments  include  civil  society  participation,  increasing  from  the  current \nbaseline of 60% in 2013; and (ii) all projects have a stakeholder analysis, and all relevant \nprojects have a participation plan. 18 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will mainstream and sustain civil society participation in ADB operations through \nfour outputs. \n \n13.   Output  1:  Innovative  knowledge  solutions  generated  and  shared  through \nengagement with CSOs and youth using online media, forums, conferences, and ADB\u2019s \nAnnual Meeting. This output will be achieved by partnering with experienced CSOs and youth \ngroups to (i) generate an innovative solutions knowledge bank of possible projects to fund; (ii) \ninclude youth in ADB policy discussion and use their insights and ideas to contribute to ADB \nknowledge;  (iii)  engage  with  CSOs  and  youth  by  supporting  their  participation  in  ADB\u2019s \ncommunities of practice (CoPs), resident mission events, and ADB\u2019s Annual Meeting; and (iv) \ncollect and publish examples and stories on the engagement and external knowledge of CSOs \n                                                \n16  ADB. 2012. ADB Perceptions Survey. Manila; ADB. 2012. Multinational Survey of Stakeholders 2012. Manila. \nAcross all categories surveyed, CSO respondents rank ADB\u2019s performance lower than that of other respondents.  \n17  CSO anchors are primarily employed as safeguard officers, external relations officers, gender specialists, or other \nfull-time staff, and they are constrained by time and lack of funds to carry out CSO outreach work. \n18  Relevant projects are defined as those identified as having medium or high depth of participation in the summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy. They are relevant projects for participation plans. \n ", "4   \nby funding exhibits and competitions on innovative proposals and by promoting social media \noutreach and knowledge searches. Sectors and thematic areas with potential to engage CSOs \nand  youth  include  water  and  sanitation,  environment,  education,  governance,  gender, \nemployment, and skills development for youth.19 \n \n14.  Output  2:  Expanded  partnerships  with  CSOs  to  involve  innovative  youth \nparticipation in development. Key activities will include: (i) produce research on youth in \ndevelopment practices and draft a framework for ADB\u2019s engagement with youth, (ii) establish \npartnerships with youth and youth-focused CSOs to support inclusive youth engagement, (iii) \nsupport youth perspectives and ideas in ADB\u2019s project operations and policy discussion through \nyouth  declaration  and  recommendation  statements,  (iv)  support  youth  events  and  youth \nparticipation  in  project  operations,  and  (v)  mobilize  youth  operational  partnerships  and \ndemonstration project implementation activities through local stakeholder mobilization on pilot \nprojects. \n \n15.  Output  3:  Enriched  ADB\u2013DMC\u2013CSO  relations  through  interaction  and \ncommunication on projects, country development issues, and country programming. Key \nactivities  will  include:  (i)  establish  \u201cGo  to  CSO  Network\u201d for routine  ADB  resident  mission \nengagement,20 (ii) develop regular outreach sessions and information sharing days so that \nCSOs are more informed about how ADB works and DMCs can have a dialogue with CSOs, (iii) \nengage a pilot regional CSO specialist to support resident mission anchors on DMC\u2013CSO \ninteraction and CSO participation projects, (iv) document good practices of CPS engagement, \n(v) support improved communications and social media through NGOC and resident mission \nanchors, and (vi) develop a basic guide for CSOs about how ADB engages with civil society. \n \n16.  Output  4:  Increased  meaningful  participation  of  civil  society  in  projects  and \nsectors. The TA will provide technical or financial assistance to selected projects and sectors to \nenable meaningful CSO participation for improved operations results. The criteria for support \nwill  be  developed  in  consultation  with  the  NGOC  and  operations  department  processing \nteams.21 Selected DMCs will be trained in approaches to participation as outlined in ADB\u2019s \nStrengthening Participation for Development Results. Sector-based participatory tools will be \nexpanded  and  communication  and  dissemination  further  developed  using  the  internet  and \ndevelopment communication channels. CSO participation in project design and implementation \nwill be supported. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months, from January 2014 to December 2016.  \nADB, through the Public Management, Governance and Participation Division of the Regional \nSustainable Development Department, will be the executing agency. The management of the \n                                                \n19  The consulting firm and individual consultants, including resource persons, may also support TA activities. \n20   \u201cGo to CSO Network\u201d are groups or individuals that ADB staff can consult with regularly to get an idea of the CSO \ncommunity with respect to ADB actions or policies.  Trusted individuals or groups that CSO anchors at resident \nmissions have built relationship and can count on to give quick and honest feedback.      \n21  Meaningful participation is based on the use of the core principles of participation as listed in ADB. 2012. \nStrengthening Participation for Development Results. Manila. \n ", "  5 \nTA will be carried out by the division\u2019s NGOC team members. CSO Cooperation Network \nmembers will coordinate implementation of in-country and regional TA activities.  \n \n19.  The  TA  will  mobilize  and  engage  12  person-months  of  individual  international \nconsultants and 47 person-months of individual national consultants. All consultants will be \nselected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  All  procurement  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). CSO anchors, CSO Cooperation Network \nmembers, the TA management team, and ADB staff from collaborating CoPs or projects will \nserve as resource persons for TA activities. Administrative support staff can conduct activities \nsupported  by  the TA.22 TA funds  may  be  used to  support  increased  CSO  participation  in \nongoing projects and preparatory TA.   \n \n20.  Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Progress will be monitored \nusing intended outcomes and outputs described in the design and monitoring framework. \n \n21.  Under output 2, ADB, through letters of agreement with project holders, will finance \ninnovative, small grants ranging from $5,000 to $30,000 to support youth-led demonstration \nprojects. Criteria for the projects will include youth-led action-oriented solutions that contribute to \ndevelopment.23 The TA will explore the possibility of supporting UNESCO\u2019s youth-led projects \nthat have been short-listed from the 8th Youth Conference.24 Partner organizations such as Plan \nInternational, World Economic Forum-Global Shapers, and Asia Society for Social Improvement \nand Sustainable Transformation will also be engaged through letters of agreement to support \nCSOs  and  youth  activities  relating  to  the  Annual  Meeting,  conferences,  forums,  media, \nknowledge systems, and training.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for \nCivil Society Participation for Development Effectiveness, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n                                                \n22 Cost estimates include support services such as travel and related costs for secretarial and administrative \nservices for assisting in implementation and administration. \n23  See attached supplement.
