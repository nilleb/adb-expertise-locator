THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  Province  Irrigation  Department  (KPID)  has  identified  three \nsubprojects forming the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Water Resources Development Project. The first \nsubproject will comprise the construction of the Mulkoh irrigation distribution system (IDS) and its \ncommand area development (CAD) in Chitral district in the north of KPP. Its construction will cover \nan intake structure, a 5-km long water tunnel, 33-km long two main canals, a 5-km long pressure \npipeline, and associated structures to distribute water to new irrigated agriculture area of 6,100 \nha with estimated beneficiaries of 32,500.1 Wheat and maize are the major crops, and the other \ncrops are fruits and fodder. The performance of the agriculture production in target areas is very \nlow mainly because the agriculture in the project area is dependent on rainfall only. Current \ncrop intensity is estimated at only 38% (17% for kharif and 21% for rabi).2 After the completion \nof the subproject, the cropping intensity is expected to increase to 130% and crop yields are \nexpected to increase by 140%\u2013200%, depending on the crop.  \n   \n  The second subproject will comprise the modernization of the Tanda IDS and its CAD in \nKohat district in the central valley plain of KPP. It will extend IDS service area to 13,520 ha and \nincrease the agriculture production in the existing and extended irrigated areas, with estimated \nbeneficiaries of 123,500. The current main crops are vegetables, wheat, maize, rice, and fruits. \nWith the subproject, the cropping intensity is expected to increase from 63% to 110%. The \nproposed modernization will include the raising of the height of Tanda dam from current 35 m to \n40 m, and remodeling or reconstruction of a spill way, an intake tower, a 260-m long water tunnel, \na main canal, distributaries, and minors. The capacity of Tanda dam constructed in 1967 has \nreduced from 96 million m3 to 61 million m3 due to sediment deposits, which resulted in the \nreduced IDS service area from about 12,141 ha to only 8,094 ha. Permanent obstructions were \nconstructed by the farmers individually along IDS to raise the water level, and these have \ndisrupted the hydraulic regime of the system with subsequent siltation and capacity reduction of \nIDS. The tail reaches of the command area are worst hit by the shortages.   \n    \n  The third subproject will comprise the modernization of the Pehur main canal (PMC) IDS \nand its CAD in Swabi district in the central valley plain of KPP. PMC IDS, with estimated \nbeneficiaries  of  180,000,  commissioned  in  1957  constitutes  a  60-km  long  main  canal,  2 \ndistributaries, and 10 minors with the total length of 72-km, and associated structures to distribute \nwater to the irrigated area of 18,200 ha. It has a discharge capacity of about 7 m3/s and off-takes \nfrom the pond of Ghazi Barotha Barrage downstream of Tarbela dam on the Indus River. The \nprincipal crops are maize, wheat, tobacco, and vegetables. Due to high conveyance losses and \nincreased water demand, the lower reaches suffer water shortages. Seepage from some sandy \nreaches in the upper canal has resulted in waterlogging, flood flow enters the canal during floods \nand often results in breaches in some other reaches, and floating weeds obstruct the flows, \nresulting in water shortages at the tail end. It is proposed to increase the canal capacity to about \n9 m3/s through remodelling of the main canal and associated structures. The distributaries and \nminors will also be remodeled as necessary. With the subproject, cropping intensity is expected \nto increase by about 20.0% to 122.8% from the estimated 102.3% (59.9% in kharif and 42.4% in \nrabi) at present while the command area of 18,200 ha will remain the same.  \n \n  A monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system using satellite remote sensing technology will \nbe developed for each IDS to assess irrigation performance, crop-growing, water productivity, \n                                                \n1  Mulkoh irrigation scheme comprises Mulkoh, Kosht, Kagh, and Lasht sub-schemes. \n2  Kharif refers to crops grown during the period from about June to November and rabi refers to crops grown during \nthe period from about December to May.  \n ", "2 \nand abiana.3 Staff from KPID will be trained to use the systems. To ensure sustainable O&M of \neach IDS, a guideline and sustainable O&M plan will also be developed. \n \n  CAD in each subproject will include (i) formation of water users\u2019 associations (WUAs) and \ncapacity developments of newly formed and existing WUAs for efficient O&M of watercourses \nand their organizations; (ii) constructions or repairs of watercourses and outlets through WUAs\u2019 \nparticipations; (iii)  trainings to farmers and WUAs for improved water use skills and climate-smart \nirrigation practices including promotion of high efficient irrigation systems (e.g. drip irrigation, \nsprinkler irrigation) and associated land management (e.g. precise land levelling); (iv) formation \nof  demonstration  plots;  (v)  conducting  of  farmer  field  schools  training  to  improve  irrigated \nagriculture practices and profitable farming system through demonstration activities including \npromotion of growing high value crops.     \n \n  Food security in Chitral is classified as \u201cstressed\u201d while Kohat and Swabi are classified as \n\u201cminimal;\u201d4 and 37% (Chitral), 32% (Kohat), and 40% (Swabi) of children under the age of five \nwere underweight.5 Food insecurity and poverty are expected to be reduced by (i) Output 1: IDS\u2019 \nestablished or modernized covering Mulkoh IDS in Chitral, Tanda IDS in Kohat, and PMC IDS in \nSwabi; and (ii) Output 2: water-use and farm-management capacities increased in the three \nsubproject areas through CADs. These outputs will result in the following outcome: agriculture \nproduction increased in project areas. The project will be aligned with the following impact: food \nsecurity in KPP ensured for the decade 2010\u20132020.6 \n \n  KPP\u2019s security concerns have been addressed when selecting the subprojects from \n\u201cmedium\u201d  or  \u201clow\u201d  security  risk  districts.7 Community  participatory  approach  for  proposed \nwatercourse  constructions  reflected  the  lessons  learnt  in  the  country  assistance  program \nevaluation, 2002\u20132012.8,9   \n  The project is estimated to cost $130 million. ADB will finance $100 million through \nconcessional ordinary capital resources loan. The government will finance (i) taxes and duties; \n(ii)  required  costs  for  environmental  and  social  mitigation;  and  (iii)  required  cost  for  land \nacquisition, resettlement, and compensation for crop losses during the project implementation, as \ncash contribution, all of which are estimated at $30 million.10 The ensuing loan and the transaction \ntechnical assistance (TA) are included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan 2018\u20132020.11 \n \nII.

Outputs and Activities  \n \n  The output of the TRTA will prepare the investment project through the following activities: \n(i) verify the engineering and agriculture outputs of the already available feasibility studies (one \nfor Mulkoh subproject and another for Tanda subproject), and update these where necessary; (ii) \nconduct fresh feasibility study of the PMC subproject; and (iii) conduct due diligence covering (a) \nclimate change risks (CCRs) and climate change impacts (CCIs); (b) economic and financial \nincluding the development of the guidance note to develop sustainable O&M plan for each IDS; \n(c) governance; (d) poverty, social, and gender; (f) social and environment safeguards; and (g) \nassessment of risks associated in implementation of the ensuing project. The activities will also \ninclude the preparation of two consultant service packages (one for the detailed design and \nanother for the project implementation support) for KPID to recruit them. The detailed design \nconsultants will be financed by KPP government\u2019s own resources and therefore it will be recruited \nfollowing Government\u2019s guidelines. The terms of reference and cost estimates for the detailed \ndesign consultants are expected to be prepared by end of July 2018 based on the midterm inputs \nfrom TRTA consultants. The project implementation support consultant, to be financed under the \nensuing project, will be recruited following ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time \nto time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n  The TA is estimated to cost $1.3 million, of which $1.2 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 1. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart \nstaff, logistical support, provisions of available feasibility studies, and facilitation of consultation \nwith stakeholders during the feasibility study, which is estimated at about 10% of the total TA cost. \nThe government was informed that approval of TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing \nproject. \n \nD.
