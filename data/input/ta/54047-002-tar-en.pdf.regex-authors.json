THE ENSUING PROJECT \n1.  The Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) is one of the poorest regions of Bangladesh. Poverty in \nthe  CHT  stems  from  prolonged  under-development  in  the  five  forms  of  capital  which  are \nnecessary to sustain livelihoods and improve overall human well-being namely: (i) physical capital \n(i.e., the lack of roads and bridges, telecommunications, water supply, irrigation and agriculture \nfacilities; (ii) human capital (i.e., the lack of access to education and vocational skills and health \nservices; (iii) social capital (i.e., prevailing political tensions, fragmented local leadership, lack of \ngovernance and social exclusion; (iv) natural capital (i.e., unsustainable land uses as a result of \nuncertain tenurial rights, and increased climate vulnerability; and (v) financial capital (i.e., lack of \npersonal savings and credit, limited inward remittances, and the limited flow of development funds \nfrom both the public and private sectors). \n2.  The proposed Climate Resilient Livelihood Improvement and Watershed Management in \nChittagong Hill Tracts Sector Project will enhance sustainable livelihood opportunities and access \nto basic services for the rural population of the CHT. The project will be aligned with the following \nimpact: enhanced human health and well-being, reduced vulnerability, and improved food security \nof the CHT people.1 The project will adopt a holistic approach and address selected deficiencies \nin all five forms of capital that are lacking in the CHT. The project outputs will be: (i) rural roads \nrehabilitated; (ii) community infrastructure developed; (iii) watershed management strengthened; \n(iv) agriculture production, processing and marketing improved; and (v) rural non-farm skills \nrelated to agriculture value chains improved. A project of $125 million for the Third Chittagong Hill \nTracts Rural Development Project is included as a firm project in the 2021 lending pipeline of the \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) country operations business plan for Bangladesh, 2020\u20132022, \nand a transaction technical assistance (TRTA) of $0.5 million to prepare it is included in the 2020 \nnon-lending pipeline.2  \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n3.  The TRTA is required to support the government to prepare the ensuing sector loan.3 The \nTRTA consultants will work closely with the assigned government counterpart staff to support \npreparation of: (i) feasibility studies, and bid documents (for the goods, works and services \npackages that must meet the readiness requirement); (ii) frameworks, procedures and templates \nfor  the  remaining  goods,  works  and  services  packages;  (iii)  required  due  diligence;  and  \n(iv) appropriate implementing arrangements. Adopting a fully consultative process, they will \ndesign outputs that meet the stated impact and outcome of the project. They will prepare all the \nproject documents required to support processing and approval of the project by ADB. They will \nalso provide start-up support to the government to mobilize implementation consultants and to \ntake advance implementation actions.4  \n \n \n1  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs. 2019.

Bangladesh. \n2  The project title has been changed from Third Chittagong Rural Development Project to Climate Resilient Livelihood \nImprovement and Watershed Management in CHT Project, to better reflect its core focus. The transaction technical \nassistance has been increased by $0.5 million through a contribution from the Netherlands Trust Fund of the Water \nFinancing Partnership Facility.  \n3 The technical assistance first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 April 2020. \n4  The technical assistance consultants may be required to undertake the detailed engineering designs (DED) of 1-2 \nsubprojects. This will be done through a variation of the contract, once the proposed financing for undertaking DED \nfrom the Project Readiness Improvement Trust Fund is secured.   \n ", "2 \nB.
