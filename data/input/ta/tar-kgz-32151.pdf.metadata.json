In 2001, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic requested Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) technical assistance (TA) for preparing the Education Development Project (EDP).1 ADB \nbegan education operations in 1995 with TA to develop the education and training master plan2 \nand is currently financing the Education Sector Development Program3 (ESDP). During the \nFact-Finding Mission fielded in February 2003, ADB agreed with the Government and other \nstakeholders that the TA and the ensuing EDP should support the Government's efforts to \nincrease  enrollment  rates  and  levels  of  learning  achievement  in  line  with  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and in close coordination with related interventions implemented \nby the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the World Bank. The \nMission  and  Government  subsequently  reached  an  understanding  on  the  goals,  purpose, \nscope, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and proposed terms of \nreference of the TA. Appendix 1 gives the tentative project framework.  \n \n2.  The Mission also undertook the initial poverty and social assessment (Appendix 2) to \nidentify the key social development and poverty reduction issues for in-depth analysis during TA \nimplementation; confirm the TA's compatibility with the Government's national poverty reduction \nstrategy; and flag poverty and social issues to be addressed under the TA as well as potential \nbeneficiary groups.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.    Since its independence in 1991, the Kyrgyz Republic has faced increasing difficulties in \nguaranteeing access to primary and secondary education for all school-age children. Although \nofficial gross enrollment rates stand at 98% for primary and 62% for secondary education,4 with \ninsignificant gender differentiation, these could substantially overstate actual participation rates.5 \nThe transition rate from primary to secondary education is estimated at about 98%. In addition, \nlearning achievement appears to have deteriorated markedly. The absence of a national testing \nsystem does not allow accurate tracking of learning achievement; however, a recent survey by \nthe Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC) identified serious problems, with over 40% of \nrespondent  pupils  failing  literacy  tests.  The  same  survey  identified  a  gulf  in  achievement \nbetween ethnic groups, with children in the Kyrgyz language stream lagging substantially behind \nchildren taught in Russian and Uzbek. Sharp regional differences also emerged, with conflict-\naffected Batken oblast far behind other regions. In addition, most children with disabilities \nremain outside the system of mainstream education. With the World Bank's poverty assessment \nfrom 2001 indicating a close link between low educational achievement and household poverty \nstatus, one can expect poverty rates to be fueled by a poorly performing education sector. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in February 2003. \n2  ADB.1995.

Manila. \n4  Children start primary education at the age of seven, which then lasts for 5 years. There then follow 4 years of \ncompulsory secondary education, after which the best-performing pupils can continue for a further 2 years of upper \nsecondary education, which allows them to enroll in the university. \n5  Enrollment figures are based on a snapshot of children registering for school at the beginning of the academic \nyear. In the course of the year, however, this enrollment declines due to several factors: (i) closure of schools in \nwinter; (ii) inability of parents to meet the costs of education; or (iii) withdrawal of children from school to generate \nincome for their families. In addition, enrollment statistics do not include most children with disabilities who can be \nexpected to constitute up to 5% of the school-age population. ", "2 \n4.    An array of factors underlie these substantial barriers to participation in education and in \nimproving the quality of learning. On the demand side, poor families face substantial obstacles \nin meeting direct costs of education such as clothing, transport, books, and stationery as well as \nthe now routine informal payments to schools. The perceived opportunity cost of participating in \neducation\u2013i.e., the perceived benefit of education versus the value of a child's labor\u2013is also a \ndisincentive, especially with declines in the quality and relevance of education services. On the \nsupply side, budgetary constraints have led to a fall in the capacity of the education sector to \ndeliver  quality  services  for  all.  The  very  extensive  school  infrastructure  developed  before \nindependence  is  deteriorating  in  the  absence  of  adequate  maintenance,  and  its  ability  to \naccommodate  growing  pupil  numbers  and  to  maintain  adequate  learning  environments  is \ndiminishing. Teacher remuneration rates now rank among the lowest in the world,6 posing \nproblems in attracting and retaining staff. As a result many schools are unable to provide all \ncompulsory subjects in the highly complex curricula, with shortfalls particularly acute in foreign \nlanguages and computer sciences. Furthermore, lack of financing for quality inputs \u2013 particularly \ntextbooks\u2013has  adversely  affected  learning  achievement.  Although  the  Government  has \ninstituted reforms to increase private education financing\u2013including condoning tuition fees at \nsecondary  and  higher  levels,  and  textbook  rental  fees,  and  permitting  private  schools  to \noperate\u2013widespread poverty means that scope for tapping such private sources remains limited. \n \n5.    Compounding the problems is a norm-based policy and planning framework, which \nassumes unrealistic levels of budgetary resources, based on pre-independence standards. In \nthe absence of any well-defined sector strategy,7 these norms provide the basic directions for \nthe  sector.  Further  reforms  are,  therefore,  needed  to  bring  these  standards  in  line  with \nresources available from private and public sources and to update the policy framework. A \nreview of educational expenditure will need to focus primarily on the principal items of public \nexpenditure, namely operation and maintenance of school facilities, staff remuneration, and \nlearning materials. To guide such reforms, further information will be needed on the current \neffectiveness of the education system in imparting high levels of learning achievement. The \nongoing  ESDP  is  addressing  this  need  by  supporting  the  development  of  an  education \nmanagement information system, which will provide improved data on school enrollment and \nother  key  quantitative  data.8  However,  the  lack  of  a  national  testing  system  precludes \nsystematic analysis of actual learning achievement on a national basis, without which it is \nextremely difficult to verify the actual impact of the education system. \n \n6.    To  address  its  deficit  in  education  financing,  the  Government  has  had  increasing \nrecourse to external assistance. In addition to ADB support, USAID recently started its Basic \nEducation Reform Project, with financing of $12 million, spread between the Kyrgyz Republic, \nTajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The World Bank plans to finance a rural basic education project in \n2004, with a grant from International Development Association resources.9 The Fact-Finding \nMission  reached  an  understanding  with  both  USAID  and  the  World  Bank  on  the  primary \nobjectives for external assistance and the need to closely coordinate activities for maximum \nefficiency. Other agencies involved in the education sector include the United Nations Children\u2019s \nFund; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization; and Soros Foundation. \nSubstantial assistance has also come from the Danish Agency for Development Assistance for \n                                                 \n6 Teacher salaries currently start at around $7 equivalent monthly, and average about $17 equivalent monthly. \n7 The Education for All paper for the Kyrgyz Republic provides the principal policy framework, and focuses on \nexpanding access to and improving the quality of basic education. It is not, however, costed or prioritized and \ncontains no performance targets, which makes its application as a planning and management tool very limited. \n8 The system has been piloted successfully in Osh oblast and is now being expanded nationwide. \n9 This project will be World Bank's first intervention in the education sector in the Kyrgyz Republic. ", "    3 \ntextbook provision and from the Islamic Development Bank and United Nations Development \nProgramme for emergency assistance.  \n \n7.    The extensive experience from externally financed projects, including previous TAs and \nthe ESDP, provided many lessons, which are incorporated into the TA's design. First, there is \nan inherent difficulty in implementing projects within an inappropriate policy environment, given \nthe high risk posed by suboptimal distribution of investment resources. To address this, TA \nactivities will focus on policy dialogue on key reform issues including (i) more cost-efficient \nservice delivery and educational facilities' management and planning; (ii) liberalizing educational \npublishing to promote quality, diversity, and cost-efficiency; and (iii) developing national testing \nsystems for improved learning assessment.  Experience from previous TAs also shows that for \npolicy  dialogue  to  be  successful,  a  strongly  participatory  approach  is  needed,  including \nparticipation  at  the  community  and  regional  levels  as  well  as  from  the  Presidential \nadministration,  which  retains  key  authority  for  policy  development.  Other  lessons  learned \ninclude  factoring  in  the  tight  constraints  on  capital  expenditure  imposed  under  the  Public \nInvestment Program when identifying investment priorities and designing project activities. In \naddition, the lack of implementation capacity of education sector agencies including MOEC and \nlocal administrations must be factored into any project design. Outputs and implementation \nmethodologies  must  be  well-defined  and  substantial  capacity-building  programs  provided, \nwhere required. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The main purpose is to assist the Kyrgyz Republic in achieving the MDGs. Specifically, \nthe TA will help prepare the EDP to support increases in enrollment rates and improve the \nquality  of  learning  in  primary  and  secondary  schools,  particularly  for  poor  and  vulnerable \nchildren. The EDP is in ADB\u2019s assistance program for 2004.  \n \n9.  Principal  TA  outputs  will  be  recommendations  for  updating  the  education  policy \nframework, a draft schools development plan, a draft strategy for providing learning materials, \nand an action plan for modernizing learning assessment systems. The TA team will also provide \nanalytical studies detailing key issues in these fields of activity, with particular attention to fiscal \nsustainability.  The  TA  team  will  also  provide  interim  and  final  reports  containing  detailed \nproposals for EDP's design, institutional arrangements, as well as fiscal implications.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Specific  TA  activities  will  include  (i)  identifying  key  policy,  financial,  and  capacity \nbottlenecks and investment needs for achieving higher enrollment rates and levels of learning, \nand identifying key reform measures; (ii) updating key sector policy documents, and developing \nstrategies and action plans to address bottlenecks and investment needs; and (iii) preparing a \ndetailed feasibility study to support the EDP design. As part of this work, the TA team will \nanalyze current education expenditures and recommend ways to improve the efficiency of \nresource allocation and utilization, as well as develop a medium-term expenditure framework for \nthe  education  sector,  prioritizing  functions  by  capital  and  recurrent  expenditures,  to  help \nestablish priorities for financing in the medium term. The TA will include a study tour to an ADB \nmember country to allow senior education practitioners to learn about alternative methods for \ndelivering and financing education services. The TA will focus on three principal areas: \n ", "4 \n1.  Ensuring the Sustainability of School Infrastructure \n11.  To  help  ensure  the  availability  of  school  places  the  TA  will  develop  proposals  for \nimproved operation and maintenance of the school network, with focus on areas with the lowest \nenrollment and attendance rates. The TA will examine rehabilitation requirements, scope for \nimproving energy efficiency (including renewable energy technologies), and long-term financing \nrequirements.  Based  on  the  recent  MOEC  survey  of  schools,  the  TA  team  will  ascertain \ncapacity utilization, needs in rehabilitating and upgrading the school network and scope for \nconsolidating  educational  facilities,  where  capacity  utilization  permits  (e.g.,  combining \nsecondary  and  vocational  educational  institutions).  Based  on  this  assessment  the  TA  will \nrecommend changes to the building standards, and develop a costed schools' development \nplan that will prioritize investment in the school network. The plan will be used as the basis for \nplanning any school development reform measures and investment activities under the EDP. An \nenvironmental assessment will also be made of the impact of civil works under the EDP, and \nscreening criteria will be developed for subproject identification. The TA will also examine the \nissue of accessibility for children with disabilities. \n \n2.  Improving Quality and Provision of Learning Materials \n \n12.  The TA will assess current and anticipated needs for textbooks and other learning \nmaterials in the education sector, particularly for areas experiencing the most severe shortages. \nThe TA will also assess existing technical and financial capacities for meeting the need for \nlearning materials with emphasis on the state of the educational publishing industry. On the \nbasis of the assessments, the TA will support the development of a strategy for providing \nlearning materials, including guidelines for a new textbook policy. The strategy will be used as \nthe basis for EDP activities for developing learning materials. Particular attention will be given to \nthe needs for learning materials of the nation's ethnic groups and children with disabilities.  \n3.  Modernizing Assessment of Learning  \n13.  The TA will review the capability of existing learning assessment systems for objectively \nmeasuring pupils' attainment at primary and secondary schools. Using the review, the TA will \nidentify key reform measures and draft an action plan for modernizing learning assessment \nsystems, drawing on comparative international experience. The plan will be used as the basis \nfor EDP activities for developing learning assessment systems. \n \n14.  TA activities will be implemented in close coordination with USAID and the World Bank, \nwhich will support activities designed to address other key reform issues including education \nfinancing,  teacher  remuneration,  teacher  training,  and  fostering  community  participation  in \neducation. The TA team will also work with these agencies to examine potential scope for public \neducation  programs  that  will  include  measures  to  prevent  the  serious  problem  of  human \ntrafficking. Coordination with these agencies will be done through the International Trustees' \nCouncil for Education chaired by ADB. In addition, joint activities will be held, including joint \nmissions, workshops, and meetings on key issues. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $720,000 equivalent, consisting of $511,500 in \nforeign exchange and $208,500 equivalent in local currency. ADB will cover the entire foreign \nexchange cost and $88,500 equivalent of the local currency cost for a total of $600,000. The TA \nwill  be  financed  by  ADB  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the ", "    5 \nGovernment of Japan. The Government's contribution, estimated at $120,000 equivalent, will be \nin kind and will cover remuneration of counterpart staff, office facilities, transport, conferencing \nfacilities  and  personnel,  as  well  as  exemptions  from  taxes  and  duties  for  TA  inputs.  The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any \nensuing project. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB  will  finance  consulting  services,  report  production,  training,  seminars,  and \nconferences as well as a study tour to an ADB developing member country, limited equipment, \nstudies,  and  surveys  as  well  as  Government  representation  in  contract  negotiations.  An \nadvance payment facility will be established to allow advances to be made to the Executing \nAgency for workshops, studies, surveys, and other miscellaneous costs.  \n \n17.  The estimated implementation period of the TA is 9 months starting around January \n2004 and finishing around October 2004. MOEC will be the Executing Agency and will provide \nsuitable office facilities for the TA team. The Deputy Minister of MOEC will be the TA director. \nThe TA director will be responsible for creating and overseeing thematic working groups\u2013whose \nactivities will be financed by the TA\u2013to support achievement of the TA objectives. A broad-\nbased steering committee will be established to supervise and provide policy guidance for the \nTA.  \n \n18.  To ensure the direct participation of education clients, the TA will select communities \naround the country for in-depth analysis and focus groups. Feedback on principal issues and \npolicy recommendations will be obtained from parents, pupils, education staff and community \nleaders. Principal beneficiary groups will also be surveyed with the use of questionnaires, direct \ninterviews and other participatory techniques. Workshops participated in by all key stakeholders \nwill be convened to discuss the results of the stocktaking exercise and conclusions for policy \ndevelopment and priority investments. \n \n19.  The indicative personnel requirements for the TA with category and person-months in \nparentheses follow: (i) Education Economist/Team Leader (International, 3); (ii) Architects/Civil \nEngineers (International, 2.5/Domestic, 18); (iii) Learning Materials Specialists (International, 2.5 \n/Domestic,  18)  (iv)  Learning  Assessment  Specialists  (International,  2.5/  Domestic,  9);  (v) \nPoverty Specialist (Domestic, 4). The TA will also finance necessary research assistants and \nsupport staff. ADB will engage a firm of consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. The firms will be required to prepare simplified technical proposals and will be \nselected using quality-and cost-based selection procedures. The consultant team will procure \nequipment using direct purchase according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, and will be \nresponsible  for  organizing  workshops,  in  cooperation  with  MOEC  and  local  education \nadministrations. Appendix 4 gives the outline terms of reference for the consultants. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Kyrgyz Republic for preparing the Education Development Project, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoals       \n       \n1.
