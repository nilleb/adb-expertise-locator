The Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Natural Gas Pipeline Project (the TAP Project) \nconsists of a gas pipeline of about 1,700 kilometers that can transport up to 20 billion cubic \nmeters  of  natural  gas  annually  from  the  Dauletabad  fields  in  southeast  Turkmenistan  to \nconsumers  in  Afghanistan,  Pakistan,  and  possibly  India.  The  final  cost  of  the  Project  is \nestimated at $2.0 billion - $2.5 billion. The design and construction of the Project will take about \n4 years, after all necessary decisions are taken by the cooperating countries. The heads of state \nof Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Turkmenistan met in Islamabad on 29\u201330 May 2002 to announce \nthe formation of a coalition for implementing the Project. The possibility of constructing a spur \npipeline taking off from the Pakistan part of the main project pipeline to the Pakistani port of \nGawadar for export of liquefied natural gas was also discussed. A steering committee of the \nministers of oil and gas from the three countries (Steering Committee) was established for \nnecessary follow-up and supervision of the Project. During its first meeting on 9\u201310 July 2002 at \nAshgabat, the Steering Committee requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to play the \nrole of a development partner and to grant regional technical assistance (TA) for  feasibility \nstudies of the Project.1 Fact-finding was completed and the draft terms of reference approved \nduring the second meeting held in Kabul on 16 September 2002.  \n \n2.  The TAP Project has significant potential for enhancing stability and improving living \nstandards in South and Central Asia. It will be a pioneering effort in linking the energy-deficit \neconomies of South Asia to the hydrocarbon-rich Central Asian countries. It will (i) provide \ncheaper and cleaner energy to consumers, (ii) generate income that can be used for developing \nthe social sectors, and (iii) bring about regional security through joint project ownership. It has \nvery long-term and widespread positive implications for the countries involved, and for the \nregion as a whole. However, the realization of the Project faces significant political and technical \nchallenges, considering the volatility of the relationships between the concerned countries and \nthe initial stage of the political process in Afghanistan through which a major part of the pipeline \npasses. \n \n3.  The TA reflects the essence of ADB's approach to regional cooperation. In facilitating the \nProject, ADB will act as an honest broker and an active development partner helping to mobilize \nthe necessary technical and financial resources for the Project. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The concept of a trans-Afghan pipeline to transport hydrocarbons (both petroleum and \nnatural gas) from Central Asia to South Asia has been mooted several times in the past decade. \nThe  last  attempt  at  developing  a  gas  transmission  pipeline  was  made  in  1997  by  an \ninternational  oil  and  gas  company.  Due  to  political  uncertainty,  however,  the  Project  was \nabandoned  after  limited  technical  feasibility  studies.  This  time,  to  strengthen  the  business \nenvironment of the Project and reduce risks, the Steering Committee has decided that (i) the \npipeline should be constructed and operated by a consortium, inter alia comprising international \noil companies and relevant national companies; and (ii) that the pipeline consortium will only \ntransport the gas and not own it. Suitable gas sale and purchase agreements are therefore to \nbe developed between Turkmenistan and buyers of the gas in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and \npossibly India, as well as a gas transportation agreement between Turkmenistan and the \npipeline consortium. Based on the projected annual gas throughput in the pipeline, a prima facie \nreview of the financial viability of the TAP Project indicates that the price of the gas delivered in \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in July 2002. ", "2    \n   \nPakistan and India would be very competitive compared with the prices of substitute fuels being \nused at present. Since the additional natural gas supply from the Project is expected to reduce \nthe use of fuel oil and coal \u2014 the main substitute fuels \u2014 the TAP Project will also generate \nconsiderable environmental benefits. During the initial years of pipeline operation, Afghanistan \nis expected to benefit mainly from its participation in the pipeline consortium by receiving a \nshare of the transit fees from the consortium. However, it is expected that a portion of the gas \nsupplied by the pipeline will be used in Afghanistan and that any surplus of the capacity of the \npipeline could also be used to transport gas produced in Afghanistan to gas consumers both \nwithin Afghanistan as well as outside it. This should stimulate investment in exploration and use \nof natural gas in Afghanistan. Similarly, Pakistan can also use any surplus capacity in the \npipeline either for domestic transportation or for export. \n \n5.  Five issues are important to the TAP Project: (i) confirmation of a market for the gas in \nPakistan and India and commitment of potential buyers to enter into gas sale and purchase \nagreements; (ii) certification that the natural gas reserves at Dauletabad field can produce the \nenvisaged quantities of gas over a period of 25\u201330 years; (iii) security concerns of Pakistan and \nIndia with regard to possible disruption of gas supplies through the pipeline; (iv) techno-\neconomic feasibility of the pipeline and preparation of its basic design, considering the terrain \nconditions and logistical constraints; and (v) required mobilization of international oil and gas \ncompanies  to  take  the  lead  role  in  the  pipeline  consortium  for  timely  and  cost-efficient \nconstruction of the pipeline, and operation and maintenance of the same in accordance with \ninternational standards. At the request of the Steering Committee, ADB is proceeding to develop \nsolutions to issues (i) and (iii) through (v). The Government of Turkmenistan is financing an \nevaluation and  certification of the recoverable gas reserves at the Dauletabad field and a \ntechnical audit of its gas production and processing facilities. The creation of a contractual basis \nfor  the  Project's  development  and  ADB's  provision  of  technical  assistance  for  preparing \ndocuments are seen as a major source of strength for the Project. \n \n6.  To address the five key issues raised in para. 5, a number of feasibility studies will be \nundertaken. The studies have been divided into six parts. \n \n(i)  Market analysis. ADB staff and staff consultant experts are analyzing the demand \nfor natural gas in north India and Pakistan. This study will establish the base \ndemand for Turkmen gas, which is necessary for the techno-economic feasibility \nstudy being conducted under this TA. The study is expected to be completed by \n10 December 2002. \n \n(ii)  Risk analysis and mitigation. Mitigating the concerns of Pakistan and India about \ndisruptions of gas supplies is important for securing their participation in the \nProject. ADB staff, in consultation with international experts, are preparing a paper \nidentifying the possible risks associated with the Project and possible mitigative \nmeasures. ADB has retained a firm of external international counsel to provide \nadvice as to (a) the legal, security, and geopolitical background of the Project; (b) \nthe contractual framework necessitated by (a) to ensure the viability of the Project, \nand (c) the provisions that should be incorporated into the inter-country Framework \nAgreement [see (v)] as a result of (a) and (b).  \n \n(iii)  Certification  of  the  production  capacity  and  facilities  at  Dauletabad  to \nsustain gas supplies over the next 25 years. This study is being organized by \nthe Government of Turkmenistan and will be completed by March/April 2003. \n \n ", "                3\n(iv)  Techno-economic study of the TAP Pipeline.  This study is being conducted \nunder the TA and will cover pipeline routing, preliminary design, cost estimates, \nrapid environmental impact assessment (EIA) and calculations of volume-price \nsensitivity.  \n \n(v)  Consortium formation. ADB staff are working with the Steering Committee to \nfinalize  the  intercountry  framework  agreement  that  will  form  the  basis  for \norganizing to implement the TAP Project. A draft version of this agreement was  \ntabled during the third meeting of the Steering Committee held in Ashgabat on 17\u2013\n18 October 2002, and was extensively discussed. Based on this draft and inputs \nindependently to be provided by ADB staff working with an international law firm, \nADB will prepare prequalification documents to assist the Steering Committee in \nmaking a shortlist of international gas companies that could become lead members \nof the consortium for the TAP Project. ADB will assist the Steering Committee, \npossibly through an advisory TA, on the final selection of consortium partners and \ncontractors from the shortlisted firms and drafting multiple agreements that are \nneeded to finalize the TAP Project. \n \n(vi)  Social impact studies. While the initial social assessment of the Project will be \ndone as part of the EIA performed under item (iv)  \u2014 studies on social impact, \npoverty analysis, and possible mitigative measures will be carried out after the \nproject concepts and routing are finalized. The activities could be done under a \nfollow-up TA that will include a final EIA and also a social impact study.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The TA will fund the preparation of a technical and economic feasibility study for the TAP \nProject. This feasibility study [para. 6 (iv) above], along with the other listed studies, will be used \nby the governments of Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and, possibly, India as a basis for \n(i) the intergovernmental framework agreement required to implement project construction, \noperation, and gas sales; (ii) the gas sales and purchase contracts between Turkmenistan and \nthe purchasers of gas from the Dauletabad field; and (iii) the transportation contract between \nTurkmenistan and the gas pipeline consortium. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n8.  The output of the TA will include route surveys, basic design of the TAP Project, cost \nestimates, implementation schedule, environment and social impact assessment, and financial \nand economic analyses. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 2. \n   \nB.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,370,000 equivalent, of which $1,250,000 will \nbe  in  foreign  exchange  and  $120,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  The  Government  of \nTurkmenistan will be funding the assessment of reserves of the Dauletabad Natural Gas Field, \nexpected to cost about $300,000 equivalent. In addition, the governments of Turkmenistan, \nAfghanistan, and Pakistan will provide $70,000 equivalent in kind, to cover costs of office \naccommodation,  transport,  salaries  of  counterpart  staff,  administrative  support,  and \ncontingencies. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program to cover \nforeign exchange costs of $950,000 and local currency costs of $50,000 equivalent for a total of \n$1,000,000.  Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3.  \n \n ", "4    \n   \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA and the Steering Committee will be its \nImplementing Agency. The Steering Committee is adequately staffed with the required persons \nand  has  the  necessary  resources  to  coordinate  with  the  international  consultant  in  the \nconsultant\u2019s techno-economic study of the TAP pipeline. In addition, each of the three countries \nhas  appointed  specialist  coordinators  to  ensure  detailed  sector  support  to  ADB  and  the \ninternational consultant. Finally, the heads of state of the three countries have arranged to meet \nevery quarter to resolve key issues concerning the Project. To ensure the commitment of the \nthree countries to the TA, it was agreed that the international consultant will be fielded only after \nthe framework agreement has been signed. \n \n11.  The TA will require about 22 person-months of input of an international consultant. The \ninternational  consultant  will  have  expertise  in  pipeline  system  design,  route  survey  and \nevaluation, costing, and financial and economic analyses. The international consultant will be \npermitted to hire domestic consultants, interpreters, and guides to assist in the route survey and \nselection. The international consultant may also contract out satellite imagery services required \nfor route survey. ADB will engage the international consultant in accordance with its Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements for selecting and engaging consultants \nincluding those required by the quality and cost based selection system. Since the scope and \nother arrangements are being specified in detail, summary technical proposals will be invited.  \n   \n12.  The TA is expected to begin in January 2003 and be completed by August 2003. The \ninternational consultant will submit inception, draft final, and final reports 1, 4, and 5 months, \nrespectively,  after  appointment.  At  the  first  tripartite  meeting,  the  steering  committee,  the \ninternational consultant, and ADB will review the inception report establish the direction of the \nstudy. The final tripartite meeting will be held after submission of the draft final report to confirm \nthe results of the TA and to establish follow-up actions by the governments and ADB. After this \nmeeting, the international consultant, at ADB's request, will present the results of the study to \nthe concerned governments, ADB staff and other stakeholders.  \n \n13.  ADB will procure an all-terrain vehicle for the use of the consultant and ADB staff in \nsupervising the work in Afghanistan. The vehicle and other small items required for completing \nthe TA will be procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. After completion \nof the TA, the vehicle will be given to the Government of Afghanistan under arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor  the
