The regional technical assistance (TA) grant was approved in December 2002 for \n$555,000,  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  providing  $500,000,  and  the \nGovernment of Singapore cofinancing $55,000 equivalent. The purpose of the grant is to \ndevelop institutional capacity in relevant agencies in the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) to enable them to effectively address road safety issues. The main \ncomponents and outputs focus on (i)  institutional  strengthening  to  establish  improved \nmanagement structures and effective coordination and funding mechanisms; (ii) capacity \nbuilding and human resource development to upgrade knowledge and skills of key \nagencies  and  staff;  (iii)  regional  cooperation  to  share  knowledge,  disseminate  best \npractices  and  develop  a  knowledge  network;  and  (iv)  encouragement  of  effective \ninvolvement of the private sector and civil society in road safety activities.  \n \n2.  Implementation of the TA commenced in July 2003. The proposed work program \nwas discussed at an ASEAN Land Transport Working Group meeting held in Hanoi, Viet \nNam in August 2003, which agreed on the individual work programs for each country. \nLocal consultants had been fielded for all countries, except Malaysia and Myanmar, by \nthe end of December 2003, and the program for national road safety workshops and \naction plan sessions has commenced. Agreement has also been reached to hold the \nregional road safety workshop in May 2004, and Malaysia has agreed to host the event. \nThe final outputs of the TA will be presented to the ASEAN transport ministers' meeting \nscheduled for October 2004 in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.  \n \n3.  The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) approached \nADB in March 2003, indicating interest in supporting the TA. In September 2003 Sida \nfielded  a  mission  to  discuss  the  regional  traffic  safety  network  that  Sida  recently \ncompleted in southern Africa and to ascertain the network's applicability in the ASEAN \nregion. With some changes to suit ASEAN conditions, the use of the e-learning tool will \nprovide  a  superior  basis  for  developing  a  road  safety  network  between  centers  of \nexcellence in ASEAN as well as between road safety agencies, the private sector, and \nnongovernment organizations. The information technology platform is easily accessed \nvia the Internet, and the information database and distance education courses can be \nadapted to ASEAN conditions. Through use of the technology an ASEAN road safety \nnetwork will be developed to extend road safety knowledge and training throughout the \nregion.  \n \n4.  Agreement has been reached with Sida to provide supplementary cofinancing of \nSKr2.25 million, approximately $304,000 equivalent, to support the TA. Funds will be \nprovided on an untied basis, used in accordance with the ADB Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and ADB Guidelines for Procurement, and a 5% administration fee will be \nimposed.   \n \n5.  The President approved on 22 March 2004 the change in scope of the TA, ADB \nadministering the supplementary funds financed on a grant basis by the Government of \nSweden, and direct selection of the University of Linkoping and retroactive financing of \ntheir services from 3 November 2003.
