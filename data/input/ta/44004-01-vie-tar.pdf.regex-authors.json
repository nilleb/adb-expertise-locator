INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  an  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  consultation  mission  in  Viet  Nam,  the \nGovernment of Viet Nam requested that ADB assist it in increasing the efficiency of the newly \nestablished  National  Power  Transmission  Corporation  (NPT)  in  order  to  improve  the \nimplementation of transmission projects. The concept paper for this technical assistance (TA) \nwas approved on 9 July 2010. A fact-finding mission visited Viet Nam on 28 July 2010 and \nreached an understanding with the government on the impact, outcome, output, implementation \narrangement, cost, and terms of reference for the TA.1 The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Vietnamese Electricity Law assigns to the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT) the \nresponsibility for restructuring and developing the power market. In October 2005, by prime \nminister\u2019s decision (258/2005/QD-TTg) the Electricity Regulatory Authority of Viet Nam (ERAV) \nwas established under the MOIT. ERAV functions include (i) issuing and enforcing electricity \nlicenses, (ii) advising the minister on market structure and policy, (iii) establishing retail tariff \nsetting  principles  and  mechanisms,  (iv)  proposing  the  market  design  and  developing  the \nassociated regulatory framework, (v) approving the power purchase agreement of the single \nbuyer, (vi) monitoring the progress of the implementation of new generation and transmission \nprojects,  (vii)  monitoring  the  operation  of  the  power  market,  and  (viii)  monitoring  (and \nrecommendations to protect) the short and long-term energy balance. \n   \n3.   The Electricity Law describes the transition period from a vertically integrated structure \nto  a  market-orientated  structure  though  three  successive  market  phases:  (i)  a  generation \ncompetitive market under a single buyer (in 2010), (ii) a wholesale competitive market (in 2014), \nand (iii) a retail competitive market (in 2020). \n \n4.   Directly  or  through  subsidiaries,  Electricity  Vietnam  (EVN)  owns  or  is  the  majority \nshareholder of most generation capacity, the 500 kilovolt (kV) / 220 kV transmission system, the \nNational  Load  Dispatch  Center,  and  the  power  companies  that  are  the  main  distribution \ncompanies with medium-voltage and some low-voltage distribution system to the urban areas \nand some rural areas. Power companies sell to independent local distribution utilities that \ndistribute through low-voltage networks and retail in rural and distant areas. \n \n5.   In  line  with  this  sector  reform  plan,  the  government  approved  EVN\u2019s  proposal  to \nestablish the NPT on 1 July 2008. The NPT is a fully state-owned single member limited liability \ncompany under EVN and is officially in operation. The NPT is responsible for the investment  \nand  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  transmission  network  in  Viet  Nam, \nincluding 220 kV and 500 kV lines and associated substations.  \n \n6.   EVN  has  also  established  the  Power  Trading  Company  (EPTC)  as  a  financial \ndependent member. The EPTC undertakes the task of purchasing electricity from power plants \nvia  the  power  market  or  via  long-term  power  purchase  agreements,  and  wholesaling  to \ndistribution companies.  \n \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 September 2010. \n ", "2  \n7.  The National Load Dispatch Center is an EVN-dependent unit in charge of continuously \nand reliably guaranteeing the quality of supply and ensuring the most economical operation of \nthe power system.  \n \n8.  In August 2008, in line with the implementation plan for the power market approved by \nthe government, ERAV issued draft electricity market regulations, detailing the methodology for \ncalculating  the  charges  of  the  transmission  and  system  market  operator,  i.e.,  EPTC,  in  a \ngeneration competitive power market. ERAV has requested the NPT and the system market \noperator to review and comment on the draft electricity market regulations and to provide it with \ntechnical input needed to introduce these regulations, at first on a pilot basis, in early 2011 in \norder to have the full generation competitive market operational by late 2011.  \n \n9.  Since the NPT has only recently been established, there is a lack of practical experience \nof power market, and it has requested ADB assistance for (i) commenting on ERAV draft \nregulations  and  assisting  the  NPT  during  further  discussion  on  this  topic;  (ii)  through \nbenchmarking with the model in use in other countries, assisting the NPT in computing the \noperational costs and corresponding transmission charges; (iii) training NPT staff in this respect; \nand  (iv)  providing  a  recommendation  on  an  adequate  institutional  structure  of  the  NPT \ncompatible  with  the  new  market-oriented  power  sector.  Technical  assistance  (TA)2  was \nprovided to the NPT in 2009 and considerable progress was made, enabling the NPT to make \nits  first  submission  to  ERAV  in  December  2009  with  the  computation  of  the  transmission \nexpenses and a proposed tariff for transmission charges. Since then, ERAV has been refining \nthe regulation documentation, and issued a new draft on 27 January 2010. It is anticipated that, \nuntil the generation competitive market is in place in late 2011, there will be some other \niterations on the regulation, for which the NPT will need further assistance. \n \n10.   The level of the NPT\u2019s allowed revenue is the most crucial data for the NPT, because \ntransmission charges are its main source of income. If the transmission charges are too low, the \nNPT will not be able to implement its investment plan and won\u2019t be able to meet the future \nfinancial requirement. Because of the current high growth in the power sector in Viet Nam, the \nNPT will have to develop the transmission system very quickly. Capital expenditure will form a \nsignificant proportion of the costs to be recovered through the transmission charges. This could \nrepresent almost half of the NPT\u2019s total cost structure in the coming years. Therefore it is crucial \nfor the NPT to optimize its investment plan and capital expenditure.  \n \n11.  From 2011 to 2016, to meet the actual growth in power demand of 15% annually, the \nNPT needs to invest about $750 million annually in new transmission assets. Taking into \naccount the huge annual investment and the fact that the NPT was only recently incorporated \n(July 2008), there is a need to plan carefully. As such, development of a 5-year business plan is \ncrucial to NPT management having a financial tool that will enable them to efficiently plan the \nrequired investment, and it needs to be regularly updated.  \n \n12.  Based on ongoing ADB-financed operations with the NPT, important delays in project \nimplementation were noted that have led to an additional financial burden for the NPT due to \nincreased commitment charges. Among the various causes of delays in implementation, two \nmain reasons have been identified: (i) lack of proper skill in terms of planning and project \nmanagement, and (ii) delay introduced by lengthy process in involuntary resettlement and land \nacquisition. The proposed TA will address these issues by providing training, guidelines, and \n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "  3\nprocedures for the project implementation unit and by developing communication tools to be \nused by the NPT in negotiating with the regional government and the population. \n \n13.  This TA will complement the assistance provided by other development partners in the \npower sector. The World Bank is providing assistance to ERAV for the development of the \ntransmission  charges  methodology,  a  grid  code,  and  for  the  design  of  the  generation \ncompetitive market in Viet Nam. The Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement is financing a long-\nterm advisor to the ERAV, whose main tasks are to coordinate the tasks and works of the \nvarious consultants involved in the power sector reform, and to assist the MOIT to develop the \nenergy efficiency law. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact will be to facilitate the development of a market-driven power sector that is \ncontributing to sustainable market growth. Indicators will be based on the electricity tariffs and \nthe increase of investment in the power generation sector from nonstate sources. The outcome \nof the TA will be to enable the NPT to have an adequate and efficient organizational structure \nthat  matches  the  requirement  of  the  new  power  sector  regulations  and  achieves  financial \nviability by 2015.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.   The four outputs of the TA will improve the daily operation of the NPT by providing (i) \ntechnical inputs as required by the ERAV for the computation of the transmission charges, (ii) a \n5-year business plan, (iii) training of NPT staff on project management procedures, and (iv) a \ncommunication strategy and guidelines. The outputs will be achieved through the following \nactivities. \n \n16.  Transmission charges and regulation. Under this activity the consultant will (i) review \nand provide comments to the NPT on the regulations issued by ERAV, and (ii) provide training \nto the NPT staff on the understanding and the use of these ERAV regulations. The TA will also \nhelp the NPT compute the transmission charges for submission to ERAV based on the NPT \noperational expenses, capital expenditures, and the related financial charges. A 5-year business \nplan (2011\u20132016) of the company will be developed under the TA. \n \n17.  Financial  management. The TA will provide the NPT with an appropriate financial \nmodel for the computation of the transmission charges based on the latest regulations issued by \nERAV. Training in the use and maintenance of the model will also be provided. \n  \n18.  Project management. The TA will provide training to at least 40 project staff on the use \nof  project  management  tools  and  planning,  procurement,  and  administration  of  investment \nprojects by 2011. \n \n19.  Communication.  The  TA  will  provide  the  NPT  with  the  required  tools  such  as  a \ncommunication strategy, procedure, and website. The aim is to improve the NPT\u2019s external \ncommunication  with  the  local  government  as  well  as  with  the  population  during  project \npreparation, implementation, and operation by 2011.  \n \n ", "4  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $720,000 equivalent. The government has \nrequested ADB to finance $600,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will finance the \nremaining $120,000 in kind to cover counterpart costs and services including counterpart staff, \noffice space, conference rooms, and telephone and internet lines. The detailed financing plan is \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The NPT will be the executing agency for this project. ADB has requested the NPT to set \nup an NPT internal working team for the TA, which will include senior staff from planning, \nbusiness, accounting, financing, and project departments.  \n \n22.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n23.  The TA will require about 25 person-months of international and national consulting \nservices. Four individual international consultants and one individual national consultant will be \nengaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). The international team will comprise a power regulatory advisor (8 \nperson-months), a financial analyst (4 person-months), a project management specialist (4 \nperson-months), and a communication specialist (3 person-months). A national communication \nspecialist will be required for 6 person-months. The TA will be completed in 18 months, from \nOctober 2010 to April 2012. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. There will not be any \nprocurement of goods under the TA. \n \n24.  The expected impact, outcome, output, and activities of the TA will be monitored through \nADB review missions and reports to be produced during the TA. Quarterly progress reports will \nbe produced during the life of the TA and a draft final report will be produced in March 2012 for \nthe regulation activities and financial strengthening of the NPT, and in December 2011 for the \nproject management and communication strategy activities. Final reports will be finalized 1 \nmonth later after incorporating the comments received. Dissemination of the output will be done \nthrough the NPT website.  \n \n \nIV.
