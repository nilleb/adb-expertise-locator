INTRODUCTION\n1.         The Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam has requested the Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA) to prepare the Forest for Livelihood\nImprovement in the Central Highlands Project.1 The TA Fact-Finding Mission visited Viet Nam\nduring 18-29 June 2001 and held discussions with stakeholders, including officials of relevant\ngovernment  and  aid  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  potential\nbeneficiaries. The Mission reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives,\nscope, approach, cost estimates, financing plan, implementation arrangements, and terms of\nreference for consulting services. The TA will focus on the central region in line with ADB\u2019s\nCountry Strategy and Program for Viet Nam. It is included in ADB\u2019s 2001 TA program for Viet\nNam and the ensuing loan program for 2003.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2.  The forest sector officially accounts for only a little over 1 percent of the official gross\ndomestic  product  (GDP)  in  Viet  Nam.  But  if  domestic  processing,  consumption  of  timber\nproducts  and  fuel  wood,  and  export  of  wood-based  products  are  taken  into  account,  the\ncontribution is nearer to 4 percent. The country\u2019s forests, comprising of about 9 million hectares\n(ha)  of  natural  forests  and  1.5  million  ha  of  plantations,  assume  an  environmental  and\ndevelopmental importance that goes beyond the official GDP estimate. This importance is owed\nto the forest\u2019s role as habitat for a large variety of animal and plant species and as hydrological\nflow  regulator  for  local  and  major  drainage  systems.  The  Central  Highland  forests  are  of\nparticular significance, as they account for about 30 percent of the total area of natural forest\nremaining  in  Viet  Nam,  with  many  biodiversity  \u201chot  spots\u201d  and  important  watersheds,  and\ncontribute about 50 percent of the total annual log harvest of the country.\n3. The forest-rich Central Highlands are also home to about three million people, with two\nthirds belonging to majority Kinh and one third belonging to various ethnic minority groups\nincluding  Ede,  Bana,  and  Jarai.  Because  of  locational  disadvantages  of  geography  and\ninaccessibility to mainstream development opportunities, this is one of the poorest regions of the\ncountry. Socioeconomic surveys in the area indicate a high incidence of poverty, with Kinh\nhouseholds suffering from food production deficits averaging more than three months, ethnic\nminority households exceeding a five-month deficit. The most common coping mechanism for\nthe  ethnic  minorities  involves  securing  food  from  the  forests  through  hunting,  foraging  for\nalternative foods, and consumption and/or sale of nontimber forest products. Furthermore, the\nlivelihood improvement and development potential of the forests in the Central Highlands is high\nrelative to other parts of the country, as the forest area per capita is 0.85 ha compared with the\nnational average of 0.13 ha per capita. A number of wood processing enterprises in the region\nhave developed export markets for manufactured wood products, but these are threatened by\nshortages of raw material. These forests also play an important role in regulating the water flow\ninto the Mekong delta and smaller rivers flowing to the east.\n4. The forest cover of Viet Nam declined by about 30 percent between 1945 and 1990.\nThis forest cover loss and depleted growing stock reduced the growth potential of the nation\u2019s\nforests. Consequently, the Government drastically reduced the annual harvest from 3.4 million\ncubic meters (m3) in 1990 to about 300,000 m3 in 1998. However, processing facilities cannot\nswitch to alternate supply sources so easily, and the supply deficit is probably being met from\nunregulated  logging  in  Viet  Nam  and  neighboring  countries.  Increasing  supply  deficits  are\nleading to increased pressure on the country\u2019s remaining forests, thereby undermining their\nwatershed and biodiversity conservation potential and effectiveness.\n                  \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Version) in May 2001.", "2\n5. Forest loss in Viet Nam has been driven by demand for agricultural land to meet the food\nsecurity needs of an increasing population, and by heavy forest exploitation, largely by state\nforest enterprises (SFEs), to provide materials and revenue for development and economic\nexpansion. Furthermore, the SFEs\u2019 preoccupation with revenue generation has made logging,\nas opposed to sustainable forest management, the object of management. Moreover, the SFEs\u2019\nmonopoly  on  timber  harvesting  has  resulted  in  up  to  70  percent  wastage  in  felling  and\nprocessing operations, resulting in substantial revenue losses and increasing pressure on the\nremaining  forests.  In  recent  years,  increasing  population  pressures  exacerbated  by  both\nregulated and unregulated in-migration from other parts of the country are in part responsible for\nthe current food and livelihood insecurity, poverty, and natural resource degradation in the\nCentral Highlands. For example, in response to a temporary rise in world coffee prices and in\nthe absence of rationalized land use policies and plans, there has been a manifold increase in\nthe area under coffee production. While delivering higher incomes to some sections of the\nsociety, the unplanned coffee cultivation has resulted in the conversion of productive agricultural\nand forest lands to coffee production; but in many cases forests are cleared to compensate for\nthe production losses suffered by the subsistence farming subsector. This process is pushing\nmany poor households, in particular ethnic minorities, to cultivate highly erodable upland slopes\nwith  low  agricultural  potential,  resulting  in  increased  food  insecurity  and  an  impoverished\nenvironment. It is recognition of these negative impacts on people and the environment that\nhave led the Government to prepare an action plan for the Central Highlands to address both\nthe emerging problems of socioecological instability and the persistent problems of food and\nlivelihood insecurity.\n6. Lessons learned from assessments of past government and externally funded programs,\npolicies,  and  institutions,  undertaken  under  TA  3255-VIE:  Study  on  Forest  Policy  and\nInstitutional Reforms,2 include the following: (i) segregating the problems of agricultural and\nforest  lands  is  no  longer  tenable,  and  therefore  intersector  coordination  at  the  policy  and\npractice levels is required; (ii) the state-dominated and centralized forest sector management\nstructure lacks market and commercial orientation; (iii) inappropriate and inadequate forestland\nclassification leads to inefficient forestland allocation and management; (iv) SFE monopoly and\ndominance prevents the development of nonstate enterprises; and (v) insufficient investments in\nimproving  human  and  natural  resource  productivity,  and  in  upgrading  forest  management\ntechnologies and practices limit the employment- and income-generating potential of the sector.\nFurthermore, experiences gained from the implementation of Loan 1515-VIE: Forestry Sector\nProject3 and other projects indicate that, for efficient and effective project implementation, the\nfollowing elements need to be in place: (i) sufficient capacities for integrated and participatory\nresource planning at the central and provincial levels; (ii) standardized cost and benefit sharing\nnorms to be used for project implementation; (iii) rationalized forest classification and land use\nplans, and forestland allocation and delineation; (iv) adequate forest technology generation and\ndelivery capacity; and (v) sufficient policy and institutional coherence and coordination.\n7. In response to increasing forest loss and poverty in the uplands, the Government, with\nthe assistance of aid agencies, has undertaken several investment projects. In 1992, Decree\n327 focused on tree planting of fast-growing species with the aim of increasing forest cover and\nemployment opportunities in the rural areas. In 1998, the Government launched the Five Million\nHectare  Reforestation  Program  (5MHRP)  with  the  aim  of  addressing  Viet  Nam\u2019s  poverty\nreduction and environmental protection priorities. The 5MHRP will bring an additional 5 million\nha under forest cover by 2010, with the broad objectives of (i) protecting the environment by\npreserving biodiversity and conserving soil and water resources; (ii) increasing the wood supply\nfor both domestic use and export; and (iii) reducing poverty and improving social development,\n                  \n2  TA 3255-VIE: Study on Forest Policy and Institutional Reforms, for $470,000, approved on 14 September 1999.\n3  Loan 1515-VIE: Forestry Sector Project, for $33 million, approved on 20 March 1997.", "3\nespecially among ethnic minorities. This shift toward linking forest sector development with\npoverty reduction is being institutionalized in the Government\u2019s Forest Sector Development\nStrategy (FSDS) for 2001-2010, which is under finalization. Furthermore, over the last two years\nthe Government, together with the aid community including ADB, has developed a formal\npartnership to support the 5MHRP, and has finalized the agreement on Viet Nam\u2019s Forest\nSector Support Program (FSSP).4 The FSSP had identified policies, strategies, and priorities\nthat are in line with international and national agreements, and that define a common work\nprogram both for (i) policy, legal, and institutional strengthening; and (ii) investment activities, as\nwell as planning, monitoring, and evaluating decision support systems.\n8. The Government\u2019s development of the FSDS, and its involvement in and ownership of\nthe FSSP process demonstrate its willingness to move toward a programmatic approach in the\nsustainable management of its forest resources. The program component of the proposed\nsector development program (SDP) will assist the Government in the implementation of the\nFSDS and FSSP by providing budgetary support. Support for the adoption of the FSDS at the\nnational level will help to create an enabling environment for the investment component, which\nwill  focus  on  the  Central  Highlands.  The  investment  component  of  the  SDP  will  promote\nlivelihood development in the target provinces in line with the FSSP. Building on the community-\nbased resource management experience of the ongoing Loan 1515-VIE and the experience of\nthe 5MHRP and other aid initiatives, and consistent with FSSP program objectives, the SDP will\nimprove livelihoods and food security in the Central Highlands, and will address local and\nnational forest resource conservation and development needs and priorities.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n9. The goal of the TA and its ensuing project is to harness the full development and\nconservation potential of Viet Nam\u2019s forest sector. The immediate objective is to assist the\nGovernment in preparing the  SDP, focusing on the Central Region, which will assist Viet Nam\nin implementing a forest policy that will enhance sustainable natural resource management and\nenvironmental protection; improve food and livelihood security; and reduce social, economic,\nand gender inequities as well as poverty by improving on- and off-farm incomes,  particularly of\nethnic minorities living in or near forests in the Central Region.\nB.  Scope\n10. The TA will comprise two parts. The first part will prepare the program component, while\nthe second part will prepare the investment component of the envisaged SDP. The investment\ncomponent will support the implementation of the policy and institutional reform actions at the\nprovincial level. Based on the FSSP program framework, the program component will provide\nthe  enabling  policy/institutional  framework  for  effective  and  efficient  implementation  of  the\ninvestment component. The TA will also identify specific project implementation support needs\nand priorities. The likely contents of policy-related actions under the program component will be\n(i) enhancement of cross-sector policy coherence; (ii) implementation of policy, regulatory, and\ninstitutional  reforms  at  the  central  and  local  levels;  (iii)  implementation  of  forest  land-use\nclassification and planning at the macro level; (iv) adoption of integrated land-use planning and\nmanagement  in  rural  areas  using  the  participatory  approach;  (v)  implementation  of  a\nreform/restructure program for SFEs; (vi) formulation and adoption of sustainable forest and\nbiodiversity management plans for priority forest areas in the country; and (vii) strengthening\n                  \n4 On 12 November 2001, the Government of Viet Nam and 20 representatives from various aid agencies, including\nADB and social and environmental NGOs, signed the FSSP Memorandum of Agreement.", "4\ntree and forest product marketing. The work will be carried out with a geographical focus on the\nCentral Highlands, and key outputs will include a cause-effect analysis, policy matrix with\nsequencing, detailed costing of the implementation of the policy matrix, proposed tranching, and\nwell-defined monitoring indicators.\n11.  The economically justified investment component will focus on the Central Highland\nprovinces of Dak Lak, Gia Lai, and Kon Tum;5 and contiguous districts adjacent to these\nprovinces. These provinces and districts are integral to the Greater Mekong watershed and will\nfacilitate the use of the landscape planning approach by the TA.6 The contents of the investment\ncomponent will include  (i) a proposal for an integrated natural resource development and\ninvestment  plan  for  the  entire  project  area;  (ii)  investment  proposals  for  the  individual\nparticipating  provinces  for  improving  livelihood  and  sustainable  forest  management;  (iii)\ninvestment proposals for ethnic minority food and livelihood security and development; and (iv)\na proposal for Global Environment Facility (GEF)-eligible biodiversity conservation work.7 Key\nactivities  for  formulating  the  investment  component  will  include  (i)  livelihood  and  natural\nresource  assessments;  (ii)  poverty  assessments  and  mapping  to  identify  the  poorest\ncommunes;  (iii)  identifying  and  prioritizing  interventions  for  improving  food  security  and\nlivelihood,  in  particular  among  ethnic  minorities;  (iv)  assessing  investment  needs  and\nopportunities for increasing on- and off-farm income from value-added forest processing and\nproducts, and ecotourism; (v) assessing investment priorities for small-scale income-generating\ninfrastructure development; (vi) assessing basic services needs such as primary health, drinking\nwater, and literacy;8 and (vii) need assessments for capacity building for local government and\ncommunes  for  integrated  and  participatory  natural  resource  development,  in  particular  of\neconomically disadvantaged ethnic minorities and women.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n12. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.95 million equivalent, comprising $1,040,000\nin  foreign  exchange  and  $910,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  ADB  will  finance\n$800,000 equivalent, including $460,000 in foreign exchange and $340,000 equivalent of local\ncurrency costs, on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of\nJapan.  The  Government  of  the  Netherlands  will  cofinance,  on  an  untied  basis,  $760,000\nequivalent, including $580,000 in foreign exchange and $180,000 equivalent of local currency\ncosts, to be administered by ADB. The Government of Viet Nam will finance the balance of\nabout $390,000 equivalent in local currency costs to cover staff salaries, office accommodation,\nand local transport costs. Details of cost estimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix\n1. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance\nany ensuing project.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n13. The  Forest  Development  Department  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural\nDevelopment (MARD) will be the Executing Agency for the TA. In each of the Project provinces\nand concerned districts, the department of agriculture and rural development (DARD) will be the\nimplementing agency for the TA. A project steering committee headed by the vice-minister of\n                  \n5  In Kon Tum province, TA implementation will be coordinated with implementation of the proposed Central Region\nLivelihoods Improvement Project to maximize inter- and intrasector synergies and development impact.\n6  Landscape planning approach allows for integrating human welfare and development needs into natural resource\ndevelopment planning.\n7  GEF-eligible conservation activities identified under the TA will have access to conservation funds to be established\nunder a World Bank-GEF project that is under preparation and scheduled for implementation in 2003-2004.\n8  The TA will identify investment needs in these sectors with the purpose of enhancing the development impact of\nthe ensuring project. However, the ensuing Project will not invest in these sector/subsector activities but will\npromote their implementation by other ADB projects, and such government programs as Program 120 and Decree\n135, which focus on rural poverty reduction.", "5\nMARD for forestry will be set up to oversee TA implementation. The TA will closely coordinate\nits  activities  with  the  FSSP  to  ensure  sector-wide  coordination.  At  the  provincial  level,  a\ncoordinating committee, headed by the vice-chairman of the provincial peoples committee, will\nbe set up and will include representatives from the provincial DARD, and from other concerned\ndepartments and districts. To ensure smooth implementation of the TA, a project preparation\nunit (PPU) headed by a director-level official of FDD will be established in FDD, and a dedicated\nmanagement team will be formed. The management team will consist of the consultant team\nleader, the PPU head, the consultant deputy team leader with geographical responsibility for\ndevelopment of provincial investment activities, and the DARD directors for each of the Project\nprovinces. The management team will meet at least once every two months and will report to\nthe provincial coordinating committees, the steering committee, and ADB on implementation\nprogress.\n14. The TA will apply a multistakeholder participatory diagnosis and design approach for\nproject preparation, and will be implemented over about 10 months commencing in April 2002,\nwith completion expected in January 2003. This will facilitate the development of agreements on\nthe  scope  of  policy  reforms  and  the  institutional  reform  action  plan,  means  for  effective\nintegration with the FSSP and the 5MHRP, and investment proposals to be implemented at the\ncentral and provincial levels, and will enable the Government to approve the feasibility study for\nthe ensuing loan project. For TA implementation, ADB will recruit (i) an international consulting\nfirm in association with domestic consultants; and (ii) on an individual basis, an international\nforest policy specialist and a participatory planning and mediation specialist, and a domestic\npublic administration specialist, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\nand other arrangements on the engagement of domestic consultants satisfactory to ADB.9 A\ntotal  of  124  person-months  of  consulting  services  will  be  required:  37  person-months  of\ninternational and 87 person-months of domestic. The required expertise and outline terms of\nreference are provided in Appendix 2. All equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement.10 At least three stakeholder workshops will be organized\u2013the first at\ninception, and the next two to discuss the draft integrated natural resource development plan,\nand the draft final report and feasibility study. These will be supplemented by provincial level\nworkshops. The following reports will be produced: (i) an inception report, by the end of the\nsecond month; (ii) an interim report and integrated natural resource plan, by the end of six\nmonths; (iii) a draft final report, two months prior to TA completion; and (iv) a final report, upon\ncompletion of the TA. ADB will set up a dedicated project team, (including staff of the Viet Nam\nResident Mission to support the implementation of the TA), and which will monitor TA progress\nthrough  the  (i)  inception,  interim,  and  final  workshop  reports;  and  (ii)  participation  in  the\nworkshops and review missions.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n15. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB\nadministering the portion of technical assistance to be financed by the Government of the\nNetherlands on a grant basis in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $760,000; and (ii)\nthe provision of technical assistance on a grant basis in an amount not exceeding the equivalent\nof $800,000, both to the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the purpose of\npreparing the Forests for Livelihood Improvement in the Central Highlands Project, and hereby\nreports such action to the Board.\n                  \n9  Individual recruitment is necessary, as these form the core team for the policy/program component. This team will\nhave to coordinate their work with, and mediate among, five main parties: the central government, provincial\ngovernments, intended beneficiaries, the FSSP, and ADB. This requires that these specialists be independent of\nthe TA implementation team.\n10 Upon TA completion, ownership of the equipment provided under the TA will be transferred to the agencies\ninvolved in the implementation of the ensuing loan project.", "6\nAppendix 1\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($'000)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

Methodology and Reporting\n2. In implementing the TA, the consultants will consult with key stakeholders, and funding\nagencies,  and  coordinate  their  activities  with  the  FSSP  and  the  Five  Million  Hectare\nReforestation Program (5MHRP). This will ensure that available knowledge and expertise are\nfully tapped in the formulation of the program/policy and investment components, that the\nrequired degree of design detail is integrated into the feasibility study so that the approval\nstandards of both the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) are fully met, and\nthat the TA implementation is effectively linked with FSSP operationalization and the 5MHRP.\nThe consultants will coordinate their activities closely with the project team set up by ADB for\nthe implementation of the TA and the formulation of the ensuing SDP.1\n3. The consultants will submit the following reports: (i) inception report, within six weeks\nafter the start of implementation;  (ii) progress report, four weeks before the midterm review of\nTA implementation; (iii) draft final report, four weeks before the final review of the TA; and (iv)\nfinal report, upon completion of the TA. The consultants will take note of ADB requirements for\nthe processing of loan projects in the implementation of the TA, and will design their reports as\noutlined  in  Staff  Instruction  on  Use  of  the  Logical  Framework  for  ADB-assisted  Loan  and\nTechnical Assistance Projects, ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Economic Analysis of Projects, Guidelines\non Integration of Poverty Impact in Project Economic Analysis,  and  ADB  Handbook for\nIncorporating Social Dimensions into Projects. The consultants will work closely with the project\npreparation team set up within the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. Reports\nsubmitted by the consultants should include the information required for the Government\u2019s\nprefeasibility study and feasibility study report as defined in Decree 17/2001/ND-CP.\nB.  Main Outputs\n1. Policy Matrix and Institutional Reform Implementation Plan\n4. Using a multistakeholder participatory diagnosis and design approach, the key activities\nof the consultants in the formulation of the program/policy component will include the following:\n(i)  Review the progress of forest sector development and reform to date. This review\nwill  focus  on  (a)  sector  development  and  investment  priorities  and  impact,  in\nparticular an analysis of the constraints to the implementation and effectiveness of\nthe forest policy and institutional reforms; and (b) identification of remaining policy,\nand legal and institutional constraints to market-led forest resource growth and\nparticipatory management. This review should make maximum use of ADB projects\nincluding TA 3255-VIE and Loan 1515-VIE. Special attention will be given to the\nprogram framework that is part of the FSSP Memorandum of Agreement signed on\n12 November 2001; the Government\u2019s 2001-2010 development strategy and plans\nfor the forest and allied sectors, including agriculture, water, rural infrastructure, and\nenergy; the Government\u2019s 5MHRP, forest sector development strategy (FSDS),\nCentral  Highlands  Development  Action  Plan,  and  poverty  reduction  programs,\nincluding Program 135; and ADB\u2019s country program and portfolio.\n                  \n1   ADB is currently finalizing a review of its operational business processes.
