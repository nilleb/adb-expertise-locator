INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Pacific Approach 2010\u20132014 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) identifies the \nneed to promote more effective development processes.1 Considerable efforts have been made \nby Pacific governments and development partners alike to enhance development effectiveness \nin the Pacific, and are reflected in endorsement of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness \nand the Cairns Compact on Strengthening Development Coordination in the Pacific. However, \nthe fragile characteristics exhibited by most Pacific developing member countries (DMCs) make \nongoing efforts towards improved development effectiveness essential.  \n \n2.  In  facilitating  enhanced  development  effectiveness,  ADB  and  the World  Bank  have \nsupported  the  operation  of  development  coordination  offices  (DCOs) 2 in  Kiribati,  Samoa, \nSolomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu.3 Each DCO is occupied by a country focal officer with \nthe support of an administrative assistant. The support provided, through the DCOs, to the \nimplementation of national development strategies and to coordinated policy dialogue between \ndevelopment partners and governments has resulted in requests for the DCOs\u2019 continuance \nwhere  they  are  already  in  operation  and  their  replication  in  additional  Pacific  DMCs.  The \nproposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  continue  to  improve  coordination  of  ADB  and \ndevelopment partner assistance to each of the Pacific DMCs participating in the TA, thus \ncontributing to improved development effectiveness.  \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s discussions with the governments of the Cook Islands, Kiribati, the Federated \nStates of Micronesia (FSM), Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu have resulted in an understanding \nof  the  impact,  outcomes,  and  outputs  of  the  TA,  as  well  as  its  costs,  implementation \narrangements, cofinancing arrangements, and the terms of reference for consulting services. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Communities in Pacific DMCs are frequently widely dispersed and isolated and often \nretain strong historical family, village, island, language, and/or ethnic allegiances. This has \nmade the building of understanding, ownership, and commitment by their peoples to national \ndevelopment goals and the concept of decision making based on the general public or national \ninterest an ongoing process. Pacific DMCs and their development partners are making efforts to \nstrengthen governance in the region. For assistance programs to be most effective in this \ndevelopment  environment,  experience  has  shown  development  partners  require  a  close, \nsensitive,  and  direct  presence  in  the  Pacific  DMCs.  This  allows  for  in-depth,  in-country \ncoordination and policy dialogue between governments and their development partners.  \n \n5.  Reflecting ADB\u2019s endorsement of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the \nCairns Compact on Strengthening Development Coordination in the Pacific, ADB is working \nclosely  with  Pacific  DMCs  and  development  partners  to  improve  coordination,  promote \nharmonization of ADB and development partner assistance, and to produce better results from \nits efforts to reduce poverty and promote development. The combination of geographic isolation \nof the Pacific DMCs and the relatively small scale ADB programs in these countries requires \ncreative and innovative approaches to ensure that ADB\u2019s response to country development \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2009. ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2010\u20132014. Manila. \n2  The World Bank refers to these as Country Liaison Offices.  \n3  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for Enhancing Engagement with Pacific Developing Member Countries. Manila \n(TA 6475-REG). \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 April 2012.  \n ", "2   \npriorities is appropriate and cost-effective, and delivers results. In response to the particular \nchallenges for project implementation posed by the geographical isolation; weak core state \nfunctions and service delivery capacity; and weak social, political, and security systems of some \nPacific DMCs, ADB supports strong coordination with Pacific DMCs and development partners \nto enhance the impact and efficiency of development assistance.  \n \n6.  Successful implementation of the previous TA was expected to raise demand for similar \nsupport in other Pacific DMCs. Feedback from the governments and development partners \nconfirmed  the  DCOs  initiated  under  the  previous  TA  had  enhanced  engagement  with  the \nparticipating Pacific DMCs, including by: \n(i)  strengthening  ADB\u2019s  relations  with  the  governments,  private  sector  and  civil \nsociety organizations; \n(ii)  improving government coordination of aid;  \n(iii)  facilitating greater harmonization of aid by ADB and other development partners; \n(iv)  improving information sharing, policy dialogue, and joint analytical work with the \ngovernments and development partners; \n(v)  improving the performance of ADB\u2019s portfolio; and \n(vi)  strengthening the relationship between ADB and the World Bank. \n \n7.  However, experiences with the previous TA demonstrated that attention needed to be \npaid to: (i) managing the expectations of some Pacific DMC governments and development \npartners with regard to the role and decision-making authority of the country focal officers, (ii) \nselecting  country  focal  officers  who  have  the  appropriate  skills  and  attitude,  (iii)  carefully \nmanaging the scheduling of development partner missions to ensure that country focal officers \nare available to fully participate as required, and (iv) ensuring the reporting lines between the \nDCOs, the governments, and ADB\u2019s Pacific Subregional Office (SPSO), Pacific Liaison and \nCoordination Office (PLCO), and Pacific Department (PARD) headquarters are clear. \n \n8.  The governments of Solomon Islands and Vanuatu support the continuation of their \nDCOs. One of the criteria warranting initial establishment of the DCOs was the size of current, \nand  likely  future,  ADB  country  portfolios  in  each  of  the  Pacific  DMCs.5 In  2011,  Vanuatu \nresumed borrowing from ADB after a period of 12 years. Two loans programmed for 2013 will \nintroduce  a  strong  focus  on  urban  development  and  renewable  energy.    Continuation  of \nVanuatu\u2019s DCO will enable ADB to support engagement around this strengthened portfolio. The \nscope of ADB-supported activities in Solomon Islands continues to deepen, and with borrowing \nexpected  to  resume  during  2012,  this  trend  is  anticipated  to  continue.  Furthermore, \nconsiderable infrastructure investment is being made by the Government of Solomon Islands, \nincluding with the support of development partners, with ADB focusing on road and water \ntransport. The addition of an infrastructure specialist to Solomon Islands\u2019 DCO would support \nthe building of government\u2019s capacity to implement and administer a growing infrastructure \nportfolio.6 The  Government  of  Solomon  Islands  has  demonstrated  itself  receptive  to  such \nsupport; the  DCO  in  Solomon  Islands  has, for  example,  provided  valuable  support  to the \nfunctioning of the joint government-development partner core economic working group. \n \n9.  The governments of the Cook Islands and FSM have asked ADB to establish DCOs in \ntheir countries. Both countries are expected to continue to have a strong relationship with ADB \nwith a significant assistance pipeline, by Pacific standards, covering areas such as infrastructure \n                                                \n5  The supplementary appendix, which is available upon request, provides details of the current and pipeline portfolio \nin the Cook Islands, Kiribati, FSM, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu.  \n6   Any additional specialist capacity could support infrastructure operations in Nauru and Vanuatu. \n ", "  3 \nplanning  and  services, water  supply,  renewable  energy  and  energy  policy,  public financial \nmanagement,  and  public  sector reforms.  Enhanced  policy  dialogue  will  support  successful \nimplementation of projects, and DCOs could facilitate the governments in their coordination of \npolicy dialogue with all development partners. Both countries have clear capacity constraints in \nthe public sector. The additional human resources the DCOs could bring to the area of aid \ncoordination are expected to make a difference in governments\u2019 ability to lead dialogue.  \n \n10.  ADB support for an administrative assistant in the World Bank-funded DCO-equivalent in \nKiribati,  which  is  shared  with  ADB,  will  enable  additional  support  to  the  government  and \nstrengthen both banks\u2019 collaboration in that country. ADB\u2019s project level engagement in Kiribati \nhas increased considerably - two loans were approved in 2010 and 2011 after Kiribati had taken \nno loans for 12 years. ADB is active in public financial management, state-owned enterprise \nreform, water supply and sanitation, and road transport. This heightened engagement is placing \nadditional  coordination  demands  on  government  and  increased  resourcing  of  the  DCO-\nequivalent in Kiribati would facilitate a stronger government lead in aid coordination and policy \ndialogue.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact of the TA in each of the five participating Pacific DMCs will be enhanced \nimplementation of national plans. The outcome will be improved ADB portfolio management and \naid coordination in each of the participating Pacific DMCs.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA proposes to (i) continue the existing DCOs in Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, (ii) \nestablish  new  DCOs  in  the  Cook  Islands  and  FSM,  (iii)  contribute  the  resource  of  an \nadministrative assistant to the World Bank\u2019s DCO-equivalent in Kiribati, and (iv) recruit an \ninfrastructure specialist to the DCO in Solomon Islands. \n \n13.  The outputs will comprise (i) DCO support for governments in implementation of national \nplans and aid coordination, and (ii) high quality advice on infrastructure project design and \nimplementation in Solomon Islands (and in Nauru and Vanuatu, subject to available capacity). \nThe  facilitating  role  of DCOs  (e.g.,  information  sharing,  capacity  building,  and  sourcing  of \nadvice) and the technical expertise of the infrastructure specialist will enhance ADB portfolio \nmanagement and improve the capacity of governments to lead efforts in aid coordination.  \n \n14.  The previous TA established DCOs in Solomon Islands (2008), Tonga (2009), and \nVanuatu (2010) to enhance engagement with ADB\u2019s Pacific DMCs. A DCO comprises a country \nfocal officer, an administrative assistant, and office facilities. In Solomon Islands, ADB and the \nWorld Bank fund a joint DCO, but employ separate country focal officers. The World Bank \nshares its DCO-equivalents in Kiribati and Samoa with ADB, while the services of the DCOs in \nTonga  and  Vanuatu  are  shared  with  the  World  Bank.  Further  grant  cofinancing  from  the \nGovernment of Australia for one transport specialist (operating from ADB\u2019s Papua New Guinea \nResident Mission), and an environment and climate change specialist (operating from SPSO), \nenabled the provision of expert advice and support on specific sector issues important to the \nobjectives of the previous TA.  \n \n15.  The country focal officers, infrastructure specialist, and the administrative assistants will \n ", "4   \nbe contracted under the TA for 2 years from 1 July 2012. Each of these positions will be \nprovided with (i) business premises, (ii) office furniture, equipment, and supplies, and (iii) an \nagreed budget, work program, and reporting arrangements. Midterm and final TA reviews, \nincluding assessment of the effectiveness of the consultant roles, should be completed 1 and 2 \nyears, respectively, after the country focal officers and infrastructure specialist  are fielded. \nThese  reviews  should  be  conducted  jointly  with  the  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (AusAID) and the World Bank.  \n \n16.  ADB will promote cost-effective and efficient implementation of the TA by (i) closely \ncoordinating and collaborating with the World Bank Sydney office and its DCO-equivalents in \nKiribati, Samoa, and Solomon Islands, and (ii) drawing on the pool of skilled persons in each of \nthe Pacific DMCs covered by the TA to provide the required consultants. These mechanisms \nwill allow ADB to give better service to the selected Pacific DMCs. The World Bank has limited \noperations in FSM; however, ADB will explore opportunities for the World Bank to supplement \nthis office. The Cook Islands is not a World Bank member and as such there is no potential for \ncollaboration in this DCO.  \n \n17.  Drawing on the lessons of the previous TA, during the implementation of the TA, PARD \nofficers will reinforce with governments and development partners the role and decision-making \nauthority  of  the  country  focal  officers.  The  country  focal  officers  will  engage  development \npartners early to ensure that missions are scheduled appropriately. To ensure the reporting \nlines between the DCOs, the governments, and ADB\u2019s SPSO, PLCO, and PARD headquarters \nare clear, terms of reference for the country focal officers will establish appropriate reporting \nresponsibilities. Attention will be paid to recruiting consultants with a good understanding of \ndevelopment in their respective countries, as well as an appropriate attitude.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $2,016,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Government of Australia and administered by ADB. AusAID has approved the \ngrant. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB will be the executing agency for this TA and implementation responsibilities will rest \nwith PARD. Once logistical arrangements to support the enhanced engagement activities have \nbeen made, day-to-day communications and reporting will be through SPSO in the case of the \nCook Islands and Kiribati DCOs; through the Pacific Urban, Social Development and Public \nManagement Division, PARD for the FSM DCO; and through PLCO for Solomon Islands and \nVanuatu DCOs. PARD will closely monitor the introduction and implementation of the new \nDCOs in the Cook Islands, Kiribati, and FSM. Cross-learning between the established DCOs in \nSolomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu and the new offices will be facilitated through monitoring \nand mentoring by senior ADB staff. \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 24 months from 1 July 2012 to 30 June \n2014. Implementation will require 240 person-months of consultant services (48 person-months \nof  international  and  192  person-months  of  national),  comprising  (i)  24  person-months  of \n ", "  5 \ninternational consulting services for the country focal officer in Solomon Islands7, (ii) 24 person-\nmonths of international consulting services for the infrastructure specialist in Solomon Islands, \n(iii) 72 person-months of national consulting services for country focal officers in the Cook \nIslands, FSM, and Vanuatu, and (iv) 120 person-months of national consulting services for \nadministrative assistants in the five DCOs. The successful applicants for these positions will be \nrecruited  as  individual  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 3. \n \n21.  The  procurement  of  office  equipment  financed  under  the  TA  will  follow  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The equipment will be handed \nover to the official contact points of the host governments on TA completion.  \n \n22.  The  proceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n23.  Each country focal officer will prepare an inception report within 4 weeks of the start of \nfield activities, including a work program with milestones and performance measures that will \nhave been agreed upon by the relevant ADB country or regional director and the respective \ngovernment. ADB will provide the work plans to AusAID for its information. Each country focal \nofficer  will  provide  quarterly  DCO  performance  reports  to  ADB  and  to  the  respective \ngovernment. ADB will report on TA progress during portfolio discussions between ADB and \nAusAID every 6 months. \n \n24.  The TA will be monitored through regular ADB missions. A midterm review of the TA will \ncommence by June 2013. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n25.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,016,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of Australia for Enhancing Engagement with Pacific Developing Member Countries, \nPhase 2. \n                                                \n7 Because  suitable  national  candidates  were  not  available  in  Solomon  Islands  under  the  previous  TA,  an   \ninternational consultant may have to be recruited to fill the post of country focal officer in Solomon Islands under \nthe TA. A similar approach may be needed in other Pacific DMCs if suitable national candidates were not available. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and   \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nEnhanced  At least 75% of projects  Reports by each  No external shocks to the \nimplementation of  planned with development  government   economies occur. \nnational plans in  partner financing in 2013-2014  on implementation of its   \neach of the five  implemented in each of the  national plan in 2017   Law and order is \nPacific DMCs  five Pacific DMCs    maintained. \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved ADB  No increase in number of  Country portfolio review  DCOs meet the \nportfolio  projects at risk from 2011  missions  expectations of Pacific \nmanagement and  baseline:    DMCs.  \naid coordination in  Cook Islands (1)  Country operation   \neach of the five  FSM (1)  business plans  Country focal officers \nPacific DMCs  Kiribati (1)    maintain independence. \n  Solomon Islands (0)     \nVanuatu (0)    Workloads are sufficiently \n    balanced for country focal \nNo increase in time from    officers to stay fully engaged \napproval to effectiveness of    with government and \nnew projects from baseline:    development partners. \nCook Islands (5.4 months;     \n2010)    Reporting lines between the \nFSM (1.8 months; 2008)    country focal officers and \nKiribati (8.5 months; 2011)    PLCO, SPSO, PARD \nSolomon Islands (4    headquarters and \nmonths; 2011)    governments are clear. \n       Vanuatu (no data)1   \n  Risks \nNo reduction in number of  Governments fail to utilize \ncoordinated   the DCO resources on offer. \ngovernment/ADB/development   \npartner analytical works from  Governments seek to unduly \n2010 baseline:  influence the country focal \n       Cook Islands (2)  officers. \nFSM (2)   \nKiribati (3)  Chosen country focal \nSolomon Islands (3)  officers are inappropriate \n       Vanuatu (3)  due to lack of skills required \nand/or independence. \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
