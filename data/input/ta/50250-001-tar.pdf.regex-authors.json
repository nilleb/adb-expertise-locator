INTRODUCTION \n1.  The South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) countries approved the \nSASEC Operational Plan, 2016\u20132025 in June 2016.1 This plan will guide the future regional \ncooperation and integration (RCI) support offered by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to the \nSASEC countries. The plan is consistent with the directions of ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for RCI \nto strengthen connectivity between economies and boost competitiveness among connected \nmarkets.2  \n \n2.  The plan outlines the SASEC program\u2019s strategic objectives and operational priorities in \nfour cooperation areas: transport, trade facilitation, energy, and economic corridor development. \nEconomic corridor development is an enhanced connectivity strategy that was recently added \nas  a  priority  initiative  to  accelerate  industrial  growth.  The  plan  also  expands  the  SASEC \nprogram\u2019s focus beyond intraregional cooperation to developing links with East and Southeast \nAsia. It contains a long list of potential projects that could be implemented in 2016\u20132025, and a \nsubset of projects for possible ADB funding in 2016\u20132020.  \n \n3.  The plan was first discussed at the SASEC Trade Facilitation and Transport Working \nGroup Meeting held on 4 November 2014 in Kathmandu, Nepal. The governments requested \nADB as the SASEC Secretariat to coordinate the preparation of the plan in close consultation \nwith the SASEC countries. In May 2016, the draft of the plan was presented to and endorsed by \nthe  SASEC  countries  at  the  Regional  Consultation Workshop  in  New  Delhi,  India.  At  this \nworkshop, SASEC members reiterated the need for ADB assistance in promoting the regional \npipeline for the next 10 years. With the proposed technical assistance (TA) support for the \nimplementation of the SASEC Operational Plan can be undertaken. It also aims to expand \nADB\u2019s existing research products on effective policy responses to the new challenges and \nemerging issues confronting SASEC member countries. The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  South Asia\u2019s growth prospects. Significant reforms in countries comprising the South \nAsia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC)3 Program produced an impressive annual \naverage growth rate of more than 8% during 2003\u20132007.  However, this tapered off to about 4% \nin  2008  (due  to  the  financial  crisis  of  2008\u20132009)  and  despite  a  rebound  in  2009-2010, \neconomic  growth  in  the  SASEC  subregion  remained  sluggish  from  2011  until  regaining \nmomentum 2014. ADB has forecasted that South Asia could become the fastest growing region \nin  Asia,  and  that  its  strong  economic  performance  will  be  fueled  by  the  SASEC  member \ncountries, which are collectively expected to grow at 7.3% in 2016 and 7.7% in 2017.4 \n  \n5.  Connectivity and integration challenges. A huge infrastructure deficit is impacting \ngrowth, and, more importantly, quality of life in the region. Connectivity among the SASEC \ncountries and with those outside the region is poor. Within SASEC countries, many areas lack \naccess  to  a  reliable  electricity  connection,  safe  water  supply,  and  adequate  roads  and \ntransportation facilities. Moreover, South Asia\u2019s trade volume with the rest of Asia remains low, \nsuggesting that the region has not fully taken advantage of Asia\u2019s rapid integration. In 2015, \n                                                \n1  SASEC comprises Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. \n2  ADB. 2016.

Manila. \n ", "2 \n \nSASEC countries' intraregional trade made up just 4.5% of its total trade with the rest of the \nworld, compared to 9.0% for Central Asia, 23.6% for Southeast Asia, and 36.7% for East Asia.5 \n    \n6.  Requisites for sustaining growth. The next 10 years will be challenging for South Asia \nas it strives to regain and sustain its growth momentum and ensure that this growth is inclusive. \nKey challenges include (i) increasing productivity and investment; (ii) creating high-value jobs in \nindustry and tourism; (iii) maintaining strong macroeconomic fundamentals through enhanced \nmacroeconomic surveillance and analysis; (iv) developing lagging regions and improving the \ndelivery of social services to these areas; (v) addressing vulnerabilities to global trends in \nenergy, climate, and food; (vi) addressing constraints on faster integration, such as high trade \ncosts, low quality infrastructure, and weak institutional capacity; and (vii) industrial development, \ninternational competitiveness, human capital development, and economic linkages with global \nproduction networks and neighboring regions in Asia. \n \n7.  Regional cooperation and integration as a sustainable growth instrument. SASEC \ncountries have been cooperating with each other to address these challenges. In transport, \nbetter connectivity has helped expand markets and fostered enterprise competitiveness  by \nincreasing economies of scale. Trade facilitation complemented infrastructure investments to \nfurther reduce bottlenecks at the borders, thus enhancing trade and economic integration. In \nenergy, power trading helped expand, diversify, and improve the security of the energy supply. \nHowever, sustaining the region\u2019s growth momentum requires refocusing the SASEC program\u2019s \noperational priorities to respond better to changes in the economic environment. In transport, \nthere is a need to address capacity constraints better and ensure seamless movement along \nintermodal  systems.  This  would  encourage  enterprises  to  diversify  production,  spurring \ninvestments, productivity, and jobs. Further deepening trade facilitation and covering both land- \nand sea-based transport by focusing on the logistics chain will help economies keep pace with a \nmore competitive global environment. Improving the diversity and security of the energy supply \nwill hinge on enhancing energy trade infrastructure and the regulatory framework. Moreover, a \nstronger focus on economic corridor development, using transport infrastructure as the basis for \nspatial development, can help increase development synergies from multisector investments \nand spread benefits to the hinterlands for more inclusive growth. \n \n8.  Broadening the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation agenda. In recent \nyears, SASEC\u2019s agenda has begun to evolve within wider integration processes taking place in \nAsia. Although SASEC has focused on links within South Asia for most of the 15 years that it \nhas existed, it has begun to pursue transport and energy links outside the region. Doing so will \nenable SASEC countries to exploit trade opportunities and economies of scale based on a \nlarger regional market, and access a larger and more diverse energy resource pool. SASEC has \naligned its connectivity agenda with the frameworks of the South Asian Association for Regional \nCooperation  (SAARC)  and  the  Bay  of  Bengal  Initiative  for  Multi-Sectoral  Technical  and \nEconomic  Cooperation  (BIMSTEC).  ADB\u2019s  support  for  SAARC\u2019s  and  BIMSTEC\u2019s  transport \nmaster plans includes funding key sections of these plans under the SASEC program. ADB \nsupport will transform transport corridors into economic corridors, thus improving multimodal \nconnectivity involving roads, seaports, and airports, which will efficiently link SASEC\u2019s industry \nclusters with production networks in neighboring regions. \n \n9.  The SASEC Operational Plan contains a long list of potential projects that support \nSASEC's strategic objectives and priorities through 2025. This list includes (i) national projects \nwith regional significance; (ii) regional projects drawn from the SAARC Regional Multimodal \n                                                \n5  ADB.

The SASEC countries have agreed that this project list should continue to \ndevelop to reflect emerging needs and priorities. The plan also contains recommendations on \nfurther developing economic corridors in the region, and exploring ways to increase synergies \namong them. \n \n10.  The plan also includes 40 projects worth about $25 billion being considered for possible \nADB financing for 2016\u20132020. Many of these projects are in advanced stages of readiness, \nalthough several require further development.  \n \n11.  The TA seeks to support the implementation of the SASEC Operational Plan. It will also \n(i) allow ADB to effectively respond to SASEC countries\u2019 requests for demand-driven knowledge \nand analytical work, (ii) continue to generate operationally relevant knowledge work, and (iii) \nbroaden the agenda of future RCI work, which will address emerging development issues in \nSASEC countries. The TA will (i) support project identification and development, scoping, and \nprefeasibility studies; (ii) facilitate the publication of flagship RCI studies on economic corridors \nand other analytical work to address key development issues in the region, including formulating \nnew  initiatives  and  preparing  the  corresponding  framework  agreements;  and  (iii)  organize \nconferences, workshops, and other outreach activities on RCI economic corridors and other \npriority initiatives. The TA will build on the progress of the SASEC program since 2001.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n \n12.  The TA\u2019s impact will be (i) increased trade and economic cooperation within the SASEC \ncountries; (ii) enhanced economic linkages between SASEC countries and East and Southeast \nAsia; and (iii) improved, sustained, and inclusive economic growth in the SASEC countries. The \nTA outcomes will be scaled-up investment in RCI and other key regional development initiatives \nin the SASEC subregion. The TA will help increase the cumulative value of approved RCI \nprojects during 2016\u20132020 by 50%. The TA will also help the SASEC countries complete at \nleast two additional regional cooperation framework agreements or initiatives that may lead to \nfuture  investment  projects,  such  as  power  trade  agreements  and  economic  corridor \ndevelopment studies.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n13.  The TA  outputs  will  include  (i)  an  annual  3-year  rolling  pipeline  of priority  regional \ncooperation projects and initiatives agreed upon by the SASEC countries; (ii) RCI analytical \nwork and other operationally relevant knowledge products; and (iii) knowledge sharing and \ncapacity development of the SASEC countries.

The third output will (i) \nprovide forums for the SASEC countries to reach a consensus on the pipeline of priority projects; \n(ii)  disseminate  study  results;  (iii)  promote  awareness  of  issues  and  discuss  possible \napproaches or initiatives; and (iv) share knowledge, experiences, and good practices.     \n \n14.  Output  1:  An  annual  3-year  rolling  pipeline  of  priority  regional  cooperation \nprojects  and  initiatives  agreed  upon  by  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic \nCooperation  countries.  SASEC  working  groups  and  nodal  officials  will  be  involved  in \ndeveloping the regional project pipeline in specific sectors. This will entail further updating and \nrefining the project list in the SASEC Operational Plan, drawing from the results of feasibility and \nother studies. To solicit commitment and foster partnerships with other stakeholders, meetings \nwith local governments, the private sector, and development partners will also be organized. At \nthe country level, consultations with the relevant ministries will be conducted to facilitate broad \nagreements on sector interventions and new initiatives.  \n \n15.  Output  2:  Regional  cooperation  and  integration  analytical  work  and  other \noperationally relevant knowledge products completed. The analytical work involved in the \nTA includes monitoring, assessing, and updating sector developments that could affect the \ndevelopment of the project pipeline. It will also address key development issues in the region, \nincluding formulating new initiatives and preparing the corresponding framework agreements. \nThe TA will support studies to examine further and address issues flagged in earlier sector \nstudies, such as the power trade regulatory framework, port logistics and facilitation, private \ninvolvement in transport facilitation, mutual recognition agreements, and value chain analysis in \neconomic corridors.   \n \n16.   Output  3:  Knowledge  sharing  and  capacity  development  of  South  Asia \nSubregional  Economic  Cooperation  countries  implemented.  Learning  events  will  be \nconducted under the TA to disseminate the results of studies and analytical work. Forums will \nbe organized to promote awareness of RCI issues and suggest approaches to address them. \nKnowledge sharing on experiences and best practices could promote a better understanding of \nissues,  foster  consensus,  and  generate  stakeholder  support  for  regional  initiatives,  thus \ncontributing to more effective implementation. The SASEC website and its related outreach \ntools, which will be updated regularly, will serve as a knowledge sharing tool. The TA project \nteam  will  also  organize  training  seminars  on  the  application  of  modern  techniques  and \ninternational best practices, especially for those involved in project implementation.  \n \n17.  Given the regional nature of this TA and the complexities of cross-border projects, the \nTA will coordinate closely with the ministries of finance and foreign affairs, as well as relevant \nline agencies in all stages of implementation. It will also engage with all relevant stakeholders \nand interested development partners to solicit their cooperation in implementing various SASEC \ninitiatives. The active engagement of all stakeholders will help generate greater support for the \nTA in particular, and for RCI in general.  \n \nC.   Cost and Financing     \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.5 million, of which $2.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) and $0.5 million by \nthe Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund.9 The detailed cost estimates and financing plan \n                                                \n9  Established by ADB.

Future replenishment of TA funding is highly likely as countries are expected \nto identify new priority projects and development challenges for further analytical work and \nassessment during national and subregional consultations. \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 48 months, from 20 November 2016 to 20 \nNovember 2020. ADB will be the executing and implementing agency. The South Asia Regional \nCooperation and Operations Coordination Division (SARC) will be responsible for implementing \nthe TA. An ADB TA team will comprise staff from SARC and other divisions, resident missions, \nand consultants as appropriate. The ADB TA team will coordinate closely with the participating \ncountries  and  other  ADB  departments,  including  the  Central  and  West  Asia  Department, \nSoutheast Asia Department, and Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department. \nDesignated focal persons in relevant divisions of the South Asia Department will help implement \nactivities and deliver outputs.  \n \n20.  The TA will require a total of 59 person-months of international consulting services and \n93 person-months of national consulting services. The consultants will have expertise in the \nfollowing main areas: (i) trade facilitation, (ii) transport, (iii) energy, (iv) environment, and (iv) \neconomic  corridor  development.  ADB  will  engage  all  consultants  in  keeping  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline terms \nof reference for consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n21.  The consultants will be recruited as individuals, and not through a firm  due to the \nfollowing factors: (i) they will be operating in different countries; (ii) their respective work and \noutputs will be independent of each other\u2019s; and (iii) they will be managed by SARC, which has \nthe capacity to perform this role.10 \n \n22.
