The proposed Gansu Jinta Concentrated Solar Power Project will construct a 50 MW \nCSP plant in Gansu Province in the PRC. It is included in the country programming mission held \nin Manila in December 2012 as standby 2013 and firm in 2014. Considering the readiness of the \nProject, early commencement of a project preparatory technical assistance (TA) is required to (i) \nconduct the due diligence on relevant aspects of the proposed project (para. 14, main text), (ii) \ntechnical guidance on technical risks assessment and development of mitigation measures for \npreliminary and detailed design and preparation of technical specification of tender documents, \nand  (iii)  familiarize  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement \nprocedure, disbursement procedure, and environment and social safeguards requirement.  \n \nB.

The TA is estimated to cost $650,000 equivalent, of which $550,000 will be financed on \na  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).

To complete \nthese activities, about 7.5 person-months of consulting services inputs from a team of various \ninternational technical experts will be required.
