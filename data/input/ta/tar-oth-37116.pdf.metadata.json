INTRODUCTION \n1.  The 1998 policy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on cooperation between ADB and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), directs ADB to expand its cooperation with NGOs. Such \ncooperation aims to strengthen the effectiveness, sustainability, and quality of the development \nservices ADB offers. The policy also calls for the integration of NGO experience, knowledge, and \nexpertise into the institution\u2019s operations so that ADB-supported activities will more effectively \naddress the issues and priorities reflected in ADB\u2019s development agenda.   \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s  Long  Term  Strategic  Framework  indicates  that  ADB  will  seek  to  expand  its \npartnership agenda by developing ways of working closely with NGOs and the private sector. The \nframework gives priority to the development of modalities for working with NGOs and civil society, \nand commits ADB to developing mechanisms for direct support to local and regional governments \n(including cities and municipalities) as well as to civil society organizations. ADB\u2019s Medium-Term \nStrategy (MTS) calls for the development of new modalities for working with NGOs, in addition to \nthose undertaken under the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and including the development of \nfunding (and control) mechanisms that will allow NGOs direct access to ADB funds. The MTS \nindicates that ADB will develop methods that will allow NGOs to implement a wider range of ADB \nprojects  and  programs,  particularly  targeted  poverty  interventions,  with  the  review  and \ndevelopment of new assistance modalities to be undertaken in 2003. \n \n3.  From  June  through  November  2002,  ADB\u2019s  NGO  Center  conducted  a  series  of \n14 participatory workshops throughout the Asia and Pacific region through TA 6021.1 The TA's \nworkshops involved about 500 representatives from ADB\u2019s major stakeholders:  governments, \nNGOs, the private sector, and ADB resident mission and headquarters staff. The consultation \nprocess culminated in a 1 week \u201cwriteshop\u201d during which selected regional participants jointly \nprepared the first draft of \u201cADB-Government-NGO Cooperation: A Framework for Action 2003-\n2005\u201d  (the  NGO  Cooperation  Framework).  By  providing  an  action  plan  for  enhanced  ADB-\ngovernment-NGO  cooperation,  the  NGO  Cooperation  Framework  also  fulfills  a  major \nrecommendation of the Presidential Committee and Task Force on ADB-NGO Cooperation.   \n \n4.  A key recommendation of the NGO Cooperation Framework is for ADB to establish a \nseparate  funding  modality  that  will  provide  NGOs  with  direct  access  to  ADB  funding;  this \nrecommendation  echoes  the  MTS  (para.  2).  Such  a  mechanism  will  demonstrate  ADB\u2019s \ncommitment to cooperation with NGOs through financial support to innovative NGO development \nactivities, including  \n \n(i)  new approaches to poverty reduction and sustainable development;  \n(ii)  pilot projects with potential for replication or upscaling;  \n(iii)  introduction of new technologies or methodologies;  \n(iv)  improved methods of monitoring or auditing the delivery of public services;  \n(v)  improved  or  enhanced  transparency,  good  governance,  and  capacity  building \nactivities; and  \n(vi)  better  means  of  including  marginalized  or  vulnerable  groups  in  ADB  project \nactivities.  \n \nThis regional technical assistance (TA) lays the foundation for a separate ADB funding modality for \nNGO activities.2 \n \n                                                 \n1    ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance for a Framework for ADB-NGO Cooperation. Manila. \n2    The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 25 March 2003. ", "2    \n5.  The World Bank\u2019s Development Grant Facility (DGF) integrates overall strategy, allocations, \nand management of the World Bank\u2019s grant-making activities funded from its administrative budget \nunder a single umbrella mechanism. The DGF has firmly established grant-making as an integral \npart of the World Bank\u2019s overall development strategy as well as an important complement to its \nlending and advisory services. In 2003, the DGF budget is $157.0 million, covering 48 grant \nprograms,  including  the  Small  Grants  Program  (which  supports  civic  engagement  for  the \nempowerment of marginalized and vulnerable groups), the Post Conflict Fund, and the Institutional \nDevelopment  Fund.  The  Inter-American Development Bank similarly has established an NGO \ngrant funding mechanism.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n6.  As outlined by the September 2001 Report of the Task Force on Institutional Arrangements \nfor Cooperation with Nongovernment Organizations,3 ADB-NGO cooperation is realized through \ntwo parallel streams:   \n \n(i)  strategic/thematic institutional cooperation through which ADB engages NGOs in \ncontinuing consultation and dialogue on cross-cutting issues; and  \n(ii)  operational cooperation at the country and project levels, including NGO provision of \nadvice or as a source of information for project identification and design as well as \nroles of consultants, implementing agencies, monitoring agencies, and evaluators.  \n \n7.  Enhanced engagement with NGOs can \n \n(i)  promote public consensus and local ownership; \n(ii)  give  voice  to  the  concerns  of  primary  and  secondary  stakeholders, \nparticularly the disadvantaged such as poor women and ethnic minorities; \n(iii)  strengthen and leverage the impact of development programs; \n(iv)  bring innovative ideas and solutions to development challenges; \n(v)  provide professional expertise and increased capacity; and  \n(vi)  improve  public  transparency  and  accountability,  thus  enhancing  the \nenvironment for good governance. \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s  1998  policy  on  cooperation  between  ADB  and  NGOs  explicitly  recognizes  the \nimportance  of  capacity  building  and  institutional  development  support  to  developing  member \ncountries (DMCs) as part of the overall effort to improve the human and social capital needed to \nsupport effective poverty reduction. In this context, ADB recognizes the critical role of NGOs in \ndevelopment and the importance of capacity building and institutional development support to \nNGOs to strengthen this role.   \n \n9.  ADB  has  made  great  strides  in  deepening  and  broadening  its  collaboration  with \ndevelopmental  NGOs.  At  the  same  time,  cooperation  activities  have  not  been  implemented \nconsistently throughout the institution, or across ADB\u2019s operations. Although NGOs are understood \nto be important development actors, the quality of ADB-NGO interaction remains suboptimal, due \nin  part  to  lack  of  institutional  capabilities  for  and  knowledge  of  how  to  cultivate  effective \ndevelopment partnerships. Much remains to be done before ADB will be able to benefit fully from \nthe skills and strengths that NGOs can bring to ADB operations.   \n \n                                                 \n3      ADB.  2001.  Report  of  the  Task  Force  on  Institutional  Arrangements  for  Cooperation  with  Nongovernment     \nOrganizations. Manila ", "  3 \n10.  Issues central to effective ADB-NGO cooperation have been identified in a number of ADB \nand  other  reports,  as  well  as  through  various  studies.4  Additional  critical  factors  in  ADB\u2019s \nrelationship with NGOs emerged from the series of ADB-government-NGO workshops held under \nTA 6021.  The issues or factors can be clustered around five key needs:   \n \n(i)  to strengthen stakeholder involvement in ADB-supported activities,  \n(ii)  to enhance transparency and interaction through access to information,  \n(iii)  to strengthen capacities to support cooperation among stakeholders,  \n(iv)  to build NGO capacity and provide institutional, and  \n(v)  to strengthen Government-NGO cooperation. \n \nIn addition to these critical factors, a related issue is how enhanced tripartite cooperation among \nADB-governments-NGOs can be mainstreamed into ADB\u2019s products and services. The NGO \nCooperation  Framework  proposes  specific  activities  to  be  implemented  during  2003\u20132005  to \nincrease effective development cooperation.   \n \n11.   A dynamic and more grounded ADB-government-NGO relationship has been constrained \nby ADB\u2019s lack of a mechanism that provides NGOs with direct access to ADB funding for capacity \ndevelopment, poverty reduction, or other mutually beneficial development activities.  Although the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction provides a funding mechanism for NGO-implemented activities, \nit requires that such activities must have a direct connection to existing or planned ADB loan \nprojects. This limitation has prevented ADB from supporting innovative NGO activities that might \ncomplement ADB\u2019s poverty reduction efforts at the country or regional levels. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.   The TA\u2019s overall goal is the enhanced development of long-term strategic partnerships with \nNGOs and governments to achieve poverty reduction in the Asia and Pacific region. Increased \nNGO  involvement  in  ADB\u2019s  support  to  government-led  development  efforts  will  increase  the \neffectiveness, sustainability, and quality of ADB\u2019s services to its DMCs. The specific purpose is to \nprovide funding to a limited number of NGOs in Group A and B DMCs to undertake innovative \npoverty reduction or other activities in key ADB sectors as identified through approved country \nstrategy and program (CSP) documents.5  The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n                                                 \n4   Such studies and reports include (i) NGO Forum on ADB.  2000.

India (as a Group B country) is excluded from the TA in that the United Kingdom\u2019s \nDepartment for International Development (DFID) has established a separate poverty reduction fund for India.  \nMyanmar also is excluded from this TA. \n \n \n       ", "4    \n13.   Expected TA deliverables include (i) the identification and approval of up to $50,000 in \nNGO-implemented poverty reduction or national development or related activities, such as NGO \ncapacity  building  in  each  participating  DMC;  (ii)  outputs  of  such  activities;  and  (iii)  full \ndocumentation of methodologies used, results, and lessons learned. Experience with implementing \nthe TA, including the identification and approval of innovative NGO-implemented activities and TA \nimplementation arrangements, will directly contribute to ADB\u2019s consideration of a separate funding \nwindow  for  NGOs  in  support  of  key  poverty  reduction  activities  (as  per  the  MTS  and  the \nrecommendations of the NGO Cooperation Framework).  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will, among other things, (i) provide funding to a limited number of NGO-designed \nand implemented project activities that are of strategic relevance to ADB\u2019s operations in eligible \nDMCs; (ii) support NGO engagement in strategic and constructive poverty-related discussions with \nADB and governments; (iii) build the capacity of local NGOs to help them work with ADB and \ngovernments in the context of ADB\u2019s operations in the Asia and Pacific region; and (iv) use the \nexperience gained during the TA to design and establish a larger, long-term assistance window to \nsupport NGO poverty reduction activities. \n \n15.   Major assumptions include the willingness of NGOs in eligible DMCs to access funding for \ninnovative  poverty  reduction  activities  provided  through  the  TA,  and  concurrence  from  DMC \ngovernments.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.    The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nthrough the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund. As it is not possible to specify the detailed costs \nof prospective NGO funding requests, Appendix 2 provides only a broad cost estimate table. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB\u2019s NGO Center will have overall responsibility for TA implementation, including the \ndevelopment of guidelines (for use  by RMs), a  template for NGO project proposals, reporting \nformats, etc.  \n \n18.  The TA will provide small grants to NGOs through RMs (or through regional departments, in \ncountries without RMs) for activities directly related to poverty reduction and enhanced ADB-\ngovernment-NGO cooperation. Experienced NGOs in eligible DMCs may submit proposals to a \nmaximum ceiling of $50,000 per eligible country, with no single project to be larger than $20,000.  \nEligibility criteria for NGOs are provided in Appendix 3. \n \n19.  RMs will solicit funding proposals from experienced NGOs. Such proposals, which must \nrelate  to  key  ADB  sectors  of  operation  as  determined  by  CSPs,  should  focus  on  discrete, \ninnovative, or demonstration approaches to poverty reduction and/or NGO capacity development.  \nCriteria for grant funding will include (i) relevance to CSPs and national poverty reduction efforts, \nincluding feasibility of upscaling as part of ADB operations; (ii) contribution to stronger and more \nproductive linkages between ADB, Governments, and NGOs; (iii) contribution to NGO capacity to \nproductively and proactively work with ADB and governments; (iv) contribution to improved NGO \ninstitutional capacity to respond to the needs of the poor; and (v) partner contributions, including \ncash or in-kind contributions by NGOs involved in individual project activities.  RMs, in consultation \nwith the NGO Center, will establish country-specific criteria for the partnership grants, in line with \nthe criteria outlined above.  ", "  5 \n \n20.  Project submissions will fall into three broad categories:  (i) pilot or other demonstration \nprojects; (ii) capacity-building activities such as NGO skills exchange and the establishment of \nNGO  information  centers  focusing  on  collaborative  work  with  ADB  and  other  major  funding \nagencies; and (iii) support to local NGOs in providing direct feedback to ADB on issues of high \nmutual  concern,  such  as  ADB  sectoral  strategies.    RMs  will  screen  and  prioritize  project \nsubmissions via a local committee with government, civil society, and donor representatives (where \nappropriate).  RMs also will arrange the translation into English of those projects recommended for \napproval.   \n \n21.  The NGO and Civil Society Committee, chaired by the NGO Center, will review projects \nrecommended  by  RMs  on  a  periodic  (e.g.,  quarterly  or  rolling)  basis,  with  project  approval \ndelegated to the Committee. Funding for approved projects will be disbursed in 2003. No project \nfunds will be disbursed without first securing an approval or \u201cno objection\u201d letter for the regional \ntechnical assistance from the Government concerned. \n \n22.  Approved projects will be completed within a 9\u201312 month time frame, with full completion of \nthe  TA  by  no  later  than  the  end  of  2004.  Each  approved  project  must  have  a  designated \nheadquarters-based \u201cpatron\u201d who will be responsible for identifying lessons learned, including the \npossibility of upscaling or otherwise incorporating project results into ADB operational activities.  \nPatrons will be selected in discussion between the concerned RM, regional department, and the \nNGO Center.   \n \n23.  The RM, the regional department patron, and/or NGO Center staff will monitor the projects, \nand  NGOs  receiving  grant  funding  will  be  required  to  prepare  project  completion  reports.  \nGenerally, lessons learned from approved projects and their implementation will be extracted from \nbrief project progress reports (prepared by funding recipients), supplemented by brief field visit(s) \nscheduled in conjunction with other in-country project monitoring activities (including by RM or \nother  headquarters  staff).  The  NGO  Center  will  prepare  an  overall  summary  of  activities \nundertaken through the TA and lessons learned, particularly with respect to the establishment and \noperation of a larger ADB direct funding mechanism or facility for NGO activities that complement \nADB\u2019s country-based poverty reduction efforts.   \n \n24.  During, but separate from, the TA, ADB\u2019s Strategy and Policy Department and the NGO \nCenter will jointly undertake a complementary study on funding mechanisms and institutional \nstructures for enhanced ADB-NGO cooperation. The TA will fund a regional workshop to discuss \nlessons emerging from the TA implementation as well as resource implications and proposed \nimplementation arrangements for a larger ADB direct funding mechanism for NGOs. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis from the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund for NGO Partnerships for Poverty \nReduction, and hereby reports this action to the Board.

To  be  eligible  for  funding,  a  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  or  civil  society \norganization must \n \n(i)  operate in a developing member country (DMC) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB);  \n  (ii)  be a not-for-profit organization; \n  (iii)  be legally registered in an ADB member country;  \n  (iv)  have operated for at least 3 years and have a demonstrated track record in  \n                        implementing small innovative project activities; \n  (v)  have a management or advisory board; \n  (vi)  have a minimum of two paid staff;  \n  (vi)  maintain a proper accounting and financial system; and \n(vii)  be committed to the principles of gender equality in terms of its own staffing, \ninvolvement of women in decision-making roles, and targeting of women as \nbeneficiaries. \n \n2.  Projects will be selected on a competitive basis within eligible countries (with some \ncompetition among countries and resident missions, due to limited overall funding).  NGOs will \nbe expected to  contribute to overall project costs, either on a financial or in-kind (e.g., staff \nsalaries) basis.  The project grants normally will not fund NGO administrative or other overhead \ncosts, or construction or capital purchase costs.  Nor will project grants fund research programs, \nformal academic training programs, ongoing institutional core support (such as equipment \nunrelated to the activity), scholarships, fellowships, study programs, individuals applying on their \nown behalf, or applications from nonlegal entities.   \n \n3.  Recommendations for funding will be made on the basis of the following criteria: \n \n(i)  Eligibility.  The organization must be legally registered in an ADB member \ncountry. \n \n(ii)  Organizational Strength.   What is the track record of the organization?  What \nare the qualifications and/or experience of key personnel?  Is the organization \nwell-known in the DMC?  What is the gender balance within the organization?  Is \nthere sufficient institutional capacity to deliver?  Does the organization maintain \nsound  internal  controls,  and  accounting  and  financial  systems?    Does  the \norganization have the capacity to liquidate funds? \n \n(iii)  Financial Viability.   Is the proposed budget feasible and/or realistic?  Is the \norganization able to make a financial or in-kind contribution to the project (e.g., \nstaff salaries)?   \n \n(iv)  Poverty  Reduction.     Does  the  project  have  direct  or  indirect  operational \nrelevance  for  ADB,  based  on  country  strategy  and  program  documentation \nand/or national development/poverty reduction plans? \n \n(v)  Objectives.
