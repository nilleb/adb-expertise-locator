INTRODUCTION\n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has conducted seminars on the use of consulting\nservices (UCS) since 1985.1 The seminars strengthen the capacity of executing agencies for\neffective engagement of consulting services in ADB-financed projects. The UCS seminars cover\nall aspects of the selection, engagement, and use of consultants in accordance with the policies\nand procedures regulated in the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by the Asian\nDevelopment Bank and its Borrowers. Appendix 1 provides the TA framework.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2.  ADB has a strong interest that consultants be used efficiently and effectively in its loan\nprojects not only because significant proportions of loan funds are used to pay for consulting\nservices but also delays in engaging consultants are commonly identified as major impediments\nin project implementation. A TA studying the issues related to the engagement of consultants\nand their impact on project performance2 generated 21 recommendations for improving the\nengagement  process,  including  providing  training  to  EA  staff.  The  recommendations  were\nreviewed by an Interdepartmental Committee headed by Chief, COSO, which found that ADB\nneeds to tighten its procedures and to commit additional resources to build the capacity of EAs\nand project staff. The Committee recommended that COCS continue to conduct UCS seminars,\nprovide one-on-one seminars for individual EAs and seminars for ADB project staff.\n3.  Assessments of previous UCS seminars confirmed that they were effective in building\nthe capacity of EA staff to effectively engage and manage consultants. The seminars focus on\nupdating knowledge in ADB procedures and strengthening skills. Inexperience and lack of\nknowledge of project staff is one reason for delays in engaging consultants and training is\nneeded for staff working on new projects and for new staff assigned to ongoing projects.\n4.  In 1999, ADB adopted poverty reduction as its overarching goal and approved the\npoverty reduction strategy. With this new strategic lending direction, 40 percent of 1999 lending\nfocused on poverty reduction while the number of new executing agencies from relevant sectors\nof the borrowing countries increased. Their capacity for engaging and using consultants to\nimplement ADB-financed projects needs to be strengthened urgently. The need is particularly\nacute in the Central Asian and Pacific islands developing member countries (DMCs), where it is\ncritical  to  improve  the  capacity  of  executing  agencies  to  engage  consultants  and  thereby\naccelerate the pace of project implementation.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n5.  The major objective of the 2000-2001 seminar program is to strengthen the technical\nknowledge  and  skills  of  executing  agency  staff  directly  involved  in  the  engagement  of\nconsultants in ADB-financed projects. Specifically, the UCS seminars are designed to (i) explain\nADB\u2019s  policies  and  procedures  for  the  selection,  engagement,  and  use  of  consultants;\n(ii) improve  and  upgrade  skills  for  the  evaluation  of  technical  proposals  submitted  by\n                                                \n1 Eight similar TAs have been approved to support UCS seminar programs.\n2  TA 5734-REG: Impact Evaluation and Special Study on Issues of Operational Importance, for $600,000, approved\non 15 April 1997, was processed and administered by Operations Evaluation Office.", "2\nconsultants; (iii) improve and upgrade skills in the preparation and negotiation of consultants\ncontracts; and (iv) enhance the capacity of effective supervision of consultants performance and\nadministration of consultants contracts.\nB.  Scope\n6.  The TA will have two components: (i) implementation of UCS seminars in selected\nDMCs (in-country seminars) and regional UCS seminars in selected ADB member regions, and\n(ii)  development  of  new  seminar  materials.  The  UCS  seminars  have  been  traditionally\nconducted in specific countries. To strengthen this training mechanism, it is proposed to conduct\nthe UCS seminars in the selected regions such as the Central Asian DMCs and Pacific islands\nDMCs.  The  regional  UCS  seminars  aim  to  supplement  in-country  seminars  and  provide\nopportunities for project staff from various countries to interact and share views. New seminar\nmaterials are urgently needed. The current materials have been in use for about five years;\nduring this period ADB\u2019s policies and procedures for engaging consultants have been revised,\nand ADB has adopted an anticorruption policy.\n7.  The UCS seminar topics will include\n(i)  an in-depth understanding of ADB\u2019s guidelines on the use of consultants and\nanticorruption policy;\n(ii) procedures followed by ADB and executing agencies in selecting and engaging\nindividual consultants and consulting firms;\n(iii)  access to sources of information on consultants (e.g., ADB\u2019s systems for data on\nindividual consultants and consulting firms) and preparation of long and short\nlists of consultants;\n(iv)  preparation of terms of reference, evaluation criteria, and invitation documents;\n(v)  evaluation and ranking of technical proposals;\n(vi)  analysis  and  appraisal  of  financial  proposals,  contract  negotiations  with\nconsultants, and preparation of contracts; and\n(vii)  supervision  of  consultants\u2019  performance  and  administration  of  consultants\u2019\ncontracts.\nC.  Cost Estimates and financing Plan\n8.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000, which will support the UCS seminars\nand the development of seminar materials. In recognition of the savings from TA 57203 that are\nadequate to finance the seminars scheduled in the first three quarters of 2000, this TA will\nfinance  the  seminars  scheduled  in  the  forth  quarter  of  2000  and  in  2001.    Detailed  cost\nestimates are shown in Appendix 2. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from ADB-\nfunded TA Program.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n9.  The UCS seminars are to be conducted in 21 selected DMCs. The selection of countries\nand regions for the seminars will be based on factors including the number of new executing\nagencies, requests from DMCs, feedback from ADB\u2019s programming and review missions, and\n                                                \n3 TA 5720-REG:Seminars on the Use of Consulting Services for $ 500,000, approved on 14 January 1997 to support\nthe UCS seminar program in 1997 and 1998.", "3\nrotation of UCS seminars among the DMCs. The target group of participants will consist of\nproject  directors  and  managers  and  midlevel  project  staff  directly  involved  in  project\nimplementation. The TA will finance incidental expenses of the participants and rental cost of\nseminar  venues.  The  host  governments  will  provide  travel  and  per  diem  costs  for  the\nparticipants who reside outside seminar cities. For the regional UCS seminars, ADB will finance\ntravel and per diem costs of the participants from other countries, incidental expenses of the\nparticipants from host countries, and the cost of the venues.\n10.  Resource persons for the UCS seminars will be consulting services specialists from\nADB\u2019s Consulting Services Division. ADB will provide seminar materials including handbooks,\nguidelines, and hands-on working exercises. The duration of each seminar will be four days,\nwith 30-35 participants per seminar. The proposed training methodology includes presentation,\ngroup discussions, topic exercises, and case studies.\n11.  An international training specialist will be required to assist ADB staff in developing new\nseminar materials. The consultant will have a track record in conducting training programs and\ndevelopment of training materials and a good knowledge of current international consulting\npractices and procedures and an understanding of ADB\u2019s policies and procedures used to\nengage consultants. Outline terms of reference for the consultant are attached in Appendix 3.\nThe consultant will be engaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants.\nIII.

The  regional  technical  assistance  will  require  an  international  training  specialist\nexperienced in designing seminars and preparing seminar documentation.  The consultant\u2019s\ninput  is  estimated  for  three  person-months,  and  the  work  will  be  done  at  the  Manila\nheadquarters of the Asian Development Bank.  The consultant will have a background in\ntraining, good knowledge of current international consulting practices and procedures, and an\nunderstanding of ADB\u2019s policies and procedures used to engage consultants.\n2. The consultant will be engaged to develop a new seminar program for ADB\u2019s seminars\non the Use of Consulting Services (UCS) which are regularly conducted by ADB\u2019s Consulting\nServices Division.  The objective of the seminar is to train executing agency staff of ADB\u2019s\ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) about procedures for engaging consultants who assist in\nimplementation of ADB-financed loans.\n3. The consultant will develop a seminar program that includes the resource persons\u2019\npresentation materials and, participants\u2019 handout materials with hands-on working exercises for\nparticipants to test the knowledge gained. As the seminars will be conducted in English and the\ncapacity of nationals of the DMCs differs in English proficiency, alternative modules will be\ndeveloped for the hands-on working exercises, with varying degrees of difficulty.\n4.  The outputs of the assignment will be\n(i)  a resource person\u2019s instructional guide;\n(ii)  the resource persons\u2019 presentation materials in overhead transparencies and in\ncomputerized \u201cPowerPoint\u201d electronic format, and it should be easily added to or\nmodified by ADB staff; and\n(iii)  participant\u2019s user notes, including exercises with model answers.\nAll materials will be in a format suitable for mass reproduction.\n5. The consultant will undertake the work in three phases.  During phase 1 (3 weeks) the\nconsultant will review the presentation and handout materials currently used at UCS seminars.\nThe  consultant  will  observe  a  UCS  seminar  and  then  develop  an  outline  seminar  format\nindicating the proposed content of the modules for ADB\u2019s review and approval.\nDuring phase II (6 weeks), the consultant will develop seminar documentation in detail (a\nresource persons\u2019 guide and presentation material, and participants\u2019 handout materials and\nexercises). ADB staff will review the seminar documentation developed by the consultant before\nits finalization.\nIn phase III (3 weeks), the consultant will incorporate ADB\u2019s comments and finalize all\nthe materials.  The consultant will then demonstrate the new UCS seminar materials to ADB\nstaff.\n(Reference in text, page 3, para. 11)"], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20010113104419", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Author": "RSA", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R15-01_RETA.doc", "ModDate": "D:20010821101131+08'00'"}}
