INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Georgia aims to improve the delivery of water supply and sanitation \n(WSS) services through effective implementation of legal, economic, and financial frameworks \nfor local self-governance. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) interim operational strategy \n(2008\u20132009) for Georgia1 was developed in line with the government's agenda, and identified \ndevelopment  of  the  country's  municipal  infrastructure  as  a  key  contributor  to  sustainable \neconomic  growth,  with  the  crosscutting  themes  of  governance,  regional  cooperation,  and \nenvironmental sustainability. ADB support to the WSS sector has grown since 2008 through the \nmunicipal services development project.2 \n \n2.  The government proposes to improve and expand WSS services across urban centers \nby leveraging donor and private sector funds, and has requested that ADB develop (i) an urban \nWSS  sector  strategy  to  assist  the  government  in  planning  long-term  investments;  (ii)  a \nregulatory framework, and establish urban WSS tariffs to improve service delivery and ensure \nsustainability  of  WSS  services;  and  (iii)  an  investment  program  to  be  financed  through  a \nproposed multitranche financing facility (MFF). To ensure informed decisions are made on WSS \ncapital improvement and rehabilitation planning, revenue management, and asset maintenance \nand  management,  the  government  requested  that  ADB  develop  a  geospatial  WSS  utility \nmanagement system for the United Water Supply Company of Georgia (UWSCG). \n \n3.  ADB  agreed  with  the  government  on  the  objectives  and  scope  of  the  technical \nassistance  (TA),  the  terms  of  reference  for  consultants,  and  the  cost  and  implementation \narrangements.3 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Access  to  services.  Water  supply  is  largely  based  on  groundwater  sources,  and \nabstraction levels are high. Nonrevenue water is estimated at 75% or higher due to ageing \ninfrastructure (no replacement or rehabilitation investment has been made since the systems \nwere  constructed).  The  systems  were  designed  for  high  supply  levels  to  consumers.  For \nexample, Tbilisi supplies 800 liters of water per capita per day with no emphasis on water \nconservation. Sewer systems cover parts of large towns (those with more than 50,000 people), \nbut there is no sewage treatment. Much of the population depends on pit latrines or septic tanks. \nSewage is discharged into water channels and rivers, affecting downstream drinking water \nquality. Investments were prioritized and undertaken on the basis of urgency, with the result that \ntheir impact was not necessarily tangible, and their sustainability questionable. This approach \nhas negative impacts on health, especially for vulnerable groups such as women and children. \n \n5.  Institutional  issues.  In  2009,  the  government  undertook  reforms  to  correct  these \ninstitutional issues. In June 2009, it consolidated 66 water companies into three regional water \ncompanies\u2014east,  west,  and  Ajara  (for  the  Autonomous  Region)\u2014on  the  basis  of \nrecommendations of TA to improve sector efficiency, supported by the United States Agency for \nInternational Development. The government created the Water Supply Regional Development \nAgency (WSRDA) under the Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure (MORDI) to \nmanage sector reforms and oversee the operations of water companies. In February 2010 \nWSRDA  merged  with  the  east  and  west  water  companies  to  form  the  UWSCG,  which  is \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009.

Sustainable financing. WSS investments began in 1996, with support from the World \nBank. Investments are largely donor financed and approximately $350 million has been invested \nto date. Funds were channeled through the MDF with onlending to local governments, except in \nBatumi  where  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW  is  developing  infrastructure \ndirectly through the local government. Cost recovery on investments is low, and billing recovers \nless than 50% of operational costs in most towns. With the consolidation of water companies, \nthe assets created through MDF and accrued liabilities by local governments were transferred \nfrom local governments to the UWSCG.  \n \n7.  External assistance. In addition to ADB, the European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment,  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW,  the  Millennium  Challenge \nCorporation, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, the United States \nAgency for International Development, and the World Bank,  have supported the government's \ninitiative to improve water and sanitation in urban centers. Focused and large-scale investments \nin  the  sector  were  through:  (i)  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  the \nMillennium Challenge Corporation, and the Swedish International Development Cooperation \nAgency  in  the  cities  of  Kutaisi,  Borjomi,  Kobuleti,  and  Poti;  and  (ii)  German  development \ncooperation  through  KfW  in  Batumi.  Support  was  primarily  based  on  requests  from  the \ngovernment and focused on improving the local economy in target cities. ADB and World Bank \nsupport  through  the  MDF  covers  the  entire  country  and  focuses  on  improving  priority \ninfrastructure.  \n \n8.  Reform agenda and ongoing ADB support. The government articulated its reform \nagenda in its Water Supply and Wastewater Sector Development Policy,4 with a clear emphasis \non (i) improving infrastructure and service quality; (ii) cost recovery, the financial sustainability of \nUWSCG, and operational efficiencies; (iii) demand management through reduced water losses; \n(iv) service access to the poor and vulnerable; (v) a legal and regulatory framework; and (vi) \nsector  management  through  modern  management  systems\u2014a  management  information \nsystem and geographic information system (GIS). ADB has provided the following support to \nGeorgia: (i) policy and advisory technical assistance to develop an urban WSS sector strategy \nto meet the government's long-term objective of improved WSS services across the country;5 \nand (ii) project preparatory technical assistance (TA) to prepare an investment program,6 to be \nfinanced through a proposed MFF.7 \n \n9.  Infrastructure design and service delivery. ADB's proposed MFF will improve WSS \nservices in the country's provincial capitals and secondary towns. Initially, the government \nproposes to improve WSS services in the towns of Zugdidi, Anaklia, Mestia, Marneuli, Kutaisi \n                                                 \n4  Government of Georgia. 2009.

Technical Assistance for Developing an Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Strategy and \nRegulatory Framework for Georgia. Manila. \n6  The investment program will specifically address (i) basic urban infrastructure and services management in the \nprovincial capitals and secondary towns, (ii) institutional issues associated with basic urban services, (iii) capacity \ndevelopment of MORDI and UWSCG staff to deliver services efficiently, and (iv) improved financial management of \ninstitutions to facilitate efficient service delivery. Trunk infrastructure traversing the towns and cities will provide \npoor communities with access to basic services\u2014potable water and safe sanitation. By developing institutionally \nand financially sustainable services, the investment program will introduce good governance features that will have \na trickle-down effect and support pro-poor growth. \n7  ADB. 2010.

The ongoing TA will develop feasibility studies for tranche 1 of the proposed MFF. The \ngovernment will recruit detailed engineering design consultants to design WSS systems in the \nsix towns, which may be retroactively financed by the proposed MFF. WSS asset location, \nalignment,  physical  condition  and  characteristics  are  fundamental  inputs  for  the  detailed \nengineering design. Infrastructure data will also assist the UWSCG to plan capital improvement \nand rehabilitation, and to establish an asset maintenance and management regime. \n \n10.  Revenue management. Improved financial management is directly related to UWSCG's \nability  to  collect  WSS  charges  from  its  consumers.  The  current  consumer  database  is \nincomplete and inaccurate with negligible historical data on consumers and payments. Non-\nrevenue  water  loss  through  illegal  connections  also  reduces  UWSCG's  ability  to  recover \nrevenues  and  manage  service  delivery  costs.  Creating  a  robust  consumer  database  with \nhistorical information on tariff payment and arrears will improve UWSCG's financial status. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n11.  The  proposed  capacity  development  TA  will  produce  a  geospatial  WSS  utility \nmanagement  system  that  will  facilitate  infrastructure  design,  improve  service  delivery  and \nenhance UWSCG's revenues in the long-term. It will provide a geospatial or GIS interface for \ndecision  makers,  which  links  an  asset  and  consumer  database  created  through  extensive \nground surveys with digital maps generated from aerial photographs and satellite imagery. It will \nallow UWSCG to: \n \n(i)  analyze asset condition in Georgia's urban centers and plan capital improvement \nand rehabilitation work; \n(ii)  develop  an  asset  maintenance  and  management  regime  to  ensure  quality  and \ncontinuity of services; and \n(iii)  analyze  service  coverage,  create  revenue  demand,  and  mobilize  resources  to \nimprove revenue collection.  \n \n12.  Mapping  of  WSS  assets  and  consumers  using  a  geospatial  or  GIS  domain  will  (i) \nprolong asset life through regular preventive maintenance; (ii) optimize asset replacement; (iii) \nreduce  non-revenue  water  loss  by  identifying  and  rectifying  system  defects;  (iv)  enhance \nefficiencies in WSS management; (v) reduce operation and maintenance costs; (vi) improve \ncost recovery, and eventually recover full service costs; and (vii) safeguard resources through \nbetter water conservation and management practices. \n \n13.  The timing of the capacity development TA is critical as it provides important information \nto  UWSCG  for  designing  infrastructure  improvement  and  rehabilitation,  planning  revenue \nmanagement  measures,  and  identifying  critical  resources  to  deliver  services  once  the \ninfrastructure is improved. Accurate costing of capital improvements and rehabilitation is critical \nfor allocating funds. Designs based on such utility management system information are more \nlikely to provide a sound base for the costing of interventions. Detailed engineering design work \nfor the WSS systems in the six towns is expected to commence in September 2010. Information \ncaptured  through  the  capacity  development  TA  will  help  to  accurately  identify  system \nimprovements. The utility management system will be implemented in other urban centers to \nimprove infrastructure and ensure sustainable services. Institutionalizing the utility management \nsystem will ensure that future investment plans are based on accurate data, that enables \nUWSCG to improve service delivery in all urban centers. \n \n ", "4 \n14.  The capacity development TA is based on the government's request and continues \nADB's support to development of the urban WSS sector. Along with the policy and advisory \ntechnical  assistance  and  the  PPTA,  the  proposed  capacity  development  TA  supports  the \ngovernment's development agenda and water and wastewater development policy framework. It \nis in line with ADB's interim operational strategy (2008\u20132009). The interim operational strategy \nis also in line with the government's agenda to improve WSS service delivery through effective \nimplementation of legal, economic, and financial frameworks for local self-governance.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The impact of the capacity development TA is linking of the capital and operational \nbudget  for  water  supply  and  sanitation  planning,  maintenance  and  management  to  the \ngeospatial  WSS  utility  management  system.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  is  that  MORDI  and \nUWSCG  use  the  geospatial  WSS  utility  management  system  for  WSS  asset  planning, \nmaintenance and management, and revenue management. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The capacity development TA will result in the following outputs: \n \n(i)  Output 1: Georeferenced cadastral maps. Through digital and visual analysis of \naerial  photography  and  satellite  data,  georeferenced  cadastral  maps  will  be \ngenerated with the following thematic layers: land use and land cover, landform, \ntransport  network,  surface  water  bodies,  urban  micro  watershed,  agglomerated \nsettlement  areas,  and  important  landmarks.  The  maps  will  form  the  base  for \nintegrating WSS asset and consumer information for the towns of Anaklia, Kutaisi, \nMarneuli, Mestia, Poti, and Zugdidi,. \n \n(ii)  Output  2:  Integrated  asset  and  consumer  database.  With  assistance  from \nUWSCG staff, the TA will map WSS assets in six investment program cities. Through \nan asset condition survey, asset attributes including age, material, asset condition, \nand  other  relevant  technical  specifications  will  be  assigned  to  the  system  and \nmapped as a thematic layer on the geospatial domain. Through a consumer survey, \ninformation  on  consumers  (residential,  commercial,  industrial),  technical \nspecifications on meters, daily water consumption data, technical specifications on \nsewer connections, and revenue information (tariffs and charges) will be created and \nlinked to the geospatial domain. \n \n(iii)  Output  3:  Utility  management  system.  The  TA  will  develop  a  WSS  utility \nmanagement  system  (web-based  software  application)  for  the  UWSCG  that  will \nassist  in  making  informed  decisions  on  future  WSS  planning,  maintenance  and \nmanagement activities across the six investment program cities. \n \n(iv)  Output 4: Staff trained on database management. The TA will improve UWSCG \nstaff skills to manage the water supply and sanitation asset database, and provide \nreal  time  asset  condition  and  consumer  information  to  designers  and  decision \nmakers in MORDI and UWSCG. \n \n17.  The  water  supply  asset  inventory  will  cover  approximately  500  km  of  the  water \ndistribution system and 150 km of water transmission mains. In addition to the network, the \nsurvey will cover manholes, valves, pressure reducers, pumps and pumping stations, chambers, \n ", "5 \ngates, switches, hydrants, anomalies, unregistered and illegal connections that are not mapped, \nand borehole supplying districts. The survey will also capture the coordinates, locations, and \ndimensions of water intake and treatment facilities, pumping stations and service reservoirs. \n \n18.  The sewerage asset inventory will cover approximately 300 km of the sewerage system \nand 50 km of sewer outfalls. In addition to the network, the survey will cover manholes, invert \nlevels at manholes, and unregistered and illegal connections that are not mapped. The survey \nwill also capture the coordinates, location, and dimensions of sewage pumping stations and \ntreatment plants, and sites for proposed pumping stations and treatment plants. \n \n19.  Creation of the consumer database will include classification of consumers (residential, \ncommercial, and industrial), and recording of the following information for each consumer: \nmonthly water consumption levels, location of water meters, monthly water charges, location of \nsewer connections, and monthly sewerage charges.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $850,000 equivalent.  The TA will be financed on \na  grant  ($800,000)  basis  by  the  Spanish  Cooperation  Fund  for  Technical  Assistance  and \nadministered by ADB. The government will finance the remaining $50,000 equivalent.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  MORDI will be the TA executing agency and UWSCG the TA implementing agency. \n \n22.  A firm will be engaged to develop the utility management system in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The firm will \nbe selected through a quality- and cost-based selection method using a 90:10 weighting due to \nthe highly skilled nature of the services. Since professional experience in WSS utility and \nmapping is important, a higher weight is given to technical scores. The firm will be evaluated \nbased on a simplified technical proposal. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix \n2. The consultants will procure database and mapping software and satellite images using the \nshopping method. Procurement of equipment and software will be in accordance with ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n23.  A team of international consultants (13 person-months) and national consultants (41 \nperson-months) will develop the TA outputs. Professionals constituting the team will include GIS \nexperts, a WSS expert, a database management expert, information technology specialists, and \nglobal positioning system analysts, coordinators and surveyors. The outline terms of reference \nfor consultants is in Appendix 3. \n \n24.  Time frame. The TA will be implemented from August 2010 through April 2011. Final \noutputs will be available in April 2011. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to Georgia to be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Spanish  Cooperation  Fund  for  Technical  Assistance  for \nDeveloping a Geospatial Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Utility Management System, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 2 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and/or \nPerformance Targets and/or  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Indicators  Mechanisms  Assumptions  \nImpact       \n      Assumptions \nCapital and  MORDI derives WSS  Annual budgets of  The government commits \noperational budget  investments from the decision  MORDI and UWSCG  to using the geospatial \nfor water and  support system by Q3 2011    WSS utility management \nsanitation planning,  system \n \nmaintenance and   \nMORDI and UWSCG streamline \nmanagement linked \ninvestment decisions \nto the geospatial \nWSS utility   \nmanagement \nsystem \n \nOutcome     \n     \nMORDI and  A system for prioritizing and  MORDI and UWSCG \nUWSCG use the  scheduling works, and costing  annual budgets  \ngeospatial WSS  interventions is operational by \nutility management  Q2 2011 \nsystem for   \ncapital improvement \nand rehabilitation \nplanning, and \nrevenue \nmanagement \n   \nOutputs       \n       \nOutput 1:  Satellite images and aerial  MORDI reporting to  Assumption \nGeoreferenced  photography procured  ADB  MORDI and UWSCG are \ncadastral maps with  Cadastral maps procured and  well networked, make \nthematic layers on a  vectorized  informed decisions using \nGIS domain  the utility management \nGPS surveys completed \n  system, and implement the \n  Land use and land cover  system throughout the \n  mapped  country's urban centers \n  City base maps generated with   \n  thematic layers   \n \n \n \n \n \nAsset conditional survey \nOutput 2: Integrated \ncompleted and attributes \nwater supply and \nassigned \nsanitation asset and \nconsumer database  Consumer survey completed and \n  billing and collection data \n  populated  \n  Thematic layers for water supply \n  and sanitation assets, and \n  consumer information integrated \n  with city base maps \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "7 \nData Sources and/or \nPerformance Targets and/or  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Indicators  Mechanisms  Assumptions  \n   \n   \nOutput 3: WSS  White paper developed for \nutility management  MORDI and UWSCG for future \nsystem  mapping of assets and \n  consumer database creation  \n \nSoftware developed to link water \nsupply and sanitation assets and \nconsumer  database on the GIS \ndomain \n \n       \nOutput 4: Staff  MORDI and UWSCG confirm     \ntrained on database  that staff are able to update   \nmanagement   database and support decision \n  makers in running queries and \n  producing outputs \n   \n \nActivities and Milestones  Inputs \n   \nADB mobilizes TA consultants (August 2010)  TA Cost = $850,000 \nTA consultants develop city base maps with thematic layers (October  2010)  \u2212  Spanish Cooperation \nUWSCG and TA consultants complete water supply and sanitation asset survey  Fund for Technical \n(November 2010)  Assistance = $800,000 \nTA consultants complete water supply and sanitation thematic layer (December \n\u2212  Government = $50,000 \n2010) \n \nTA consultants develop the WSS utility management system (January 2011) \nConsulting  Services  - \nUWSCG and TA consultants successfully test the software (January 2011) \nFirm: \nTA consultants train MORDI and UWSCG staff (February 2011) \n  \u2212  International = 13 \n  person-months \n\u2212  National = 41 person-\nmonths \n\u2212  Selection Method = \nQCBS (90:10) \n\u2212  Proposal Type = \nSimplified Technical \nProposal \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, GIS = geographic information system, GPS = global positioning system, MORDI = \nMinistry of Regional Development and Infrastructure, Q = quarter, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, TA = \ntechnical assistance, UWSCG = United Water Supply Company of Georgia, WSS = water supply and sanitation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \n     Item  Total Cost \n   \nA.

The outputs of the capacity development technical assistance (capacity development TA) \nare:  \n \n(i)  georeferenced cadastral maps for project cities with thematic layers;  \n(ii)  a database on water supply and sanitation (WSS) assets, including the condition and \nlayout (superimposed as a thematic layer);  \n(iii)  a database on consumers (superimposed as a thematic layer); and  \n(iv)  a web-based WSS utility management system on a geographic information system \n(GIS) domain at the service utility's headquarters for decision making.  \n \n2.  Georgia has georeferenced and coordinated orthophotos from aerial photographs for the \nproject cities.1 The base map will draw from existing orthophotos and cadastral maps (where \navailable), supported and updated through satellite imagery with 0.6 m (or higher) ground \nresolution for newly developed areas as agreed with the United Water Supply Company of \nGeorgia (UWSCG), the capacity developmentTA implementing agency. The base map shall \ncover basic land use and geographical features that will immediately facilitate utility mapping of \nwater supply and sanitation assets and subsequently be developed for tax mapping and urban \nmaster planning. The work will include remote sensing (as required), ground truthing, and use of \nthe global positioning system (GPS) in combination with a GIS. The activity will focus on \nderiving spatial information on various themes of importance to the urban domain at a cadastral \nscale.  \n \n3.  WSS asset attributes and consumer information will be captured in a database and \nlinked  to  the  spatial  information  system  or  the  GIS  platform.  A  web-based  WSS  utility \nmanagement system will access the database and provide UWSCG with a decision-making tool \nto  address  long-term  asset  planning,  maintenance  and  management.  The  WSS  utility \nmanagement system will include query functions to facilitate decision making, and will facilitate \nUWSCG capital and operation and maintenance investment planning in investment program \ntowns.2 The WSS utility management system and the process involved in creating the database \nwill eventually be implemented across all towns in Georgia. \n \nB.  Detailed Tasks \n1.  Procuring Data Products and Cadastral Sheets \n4.  Cloud-free satellite images in Geo-Tiff format with Rational Polynomial Coefficient (RPC) \nfiles  should  be  procured  along  with  cadastral  maps  of  appropriate  scale  from  constituent \nadministration or local self-government bodies. \n                                                 \n1  Various donor-financed projects since the late 1990s have helped with aerial photography and creation of \ngeoreferenced and coordinated orthophotographs.  \n2  The investment program will specifically address (i) basic urban infrastructure and services management in the \nprovincial capitals and secondary towns, (ii) institutional issues associated with basic urban services, (iii) capacity \ndevelopment of the Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure and UWSCG staff to deliver services \nefficiently, and (iv) improved financial management of institutions to facilitate efficient service delivery. Trunk \ninfrastructure traversing the towns and cities will provide poor communities with access to basic services\u2014potable \nwater and safe sanitation. By developing institutionally and financially sustainable services, the investment program \nwill introduce good governance features that will have a trickle-down effect and support pro-poor growth. \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n2.  Conducting  a  Global  Positioning  System  Survey  of  Principal  and \nSecondary Reference Points \n5.  Georeferencing the cadastry and high resolution remote sensing data requires precise \nlocation control. Referencing using 3D coordinates obtained with differential positioning using \nGPS receivers gives an accuracy of about 1 meter. A sufficient number of ground control points \n(GCPs)  should  be  identified  in  the  field  and  a  single  frequency  GPS  survey  should  be \nundertaken with reference to the principal reference point. The data should be post-processed \nto  derive  World  Geodetic  System-1984  (WGS-84)  coordinates.  Spot  heights  should  be \ngenerated  using  barometric  measurements  at  close  intervals  to  provide  terrain  elevation \ninformation.  \n \n6.  Depending on the terrain conditions, appropriate elevation information will need to be \nprovided. A GPS survey by real time kinematic mode should be carried out to generate as much \nelevation data as possible. GCPs function as base stations, with their computed coordinates \nserving  as  controls,  and  the  rover  receiving  the  corrections  through  the  radio  modem \ncommunications provides positions accurate to 30 cm or less. This will be carried out in a grid \npattern so that a digital elevation model with a fair representation of the terrain is obtained. \n  \n3.  Georeferencing Satellite Data or Aerial Photos and Cadastry \n7.  To integrate spatial information on a GIS platform, all spatial information must conform to \na specific real world coordinate system with a defined datum, and acquired satellite images \nmust be referenced to a defined coordinate system.  \n \n8.  Ortho-ready satellite images or aerial photographs should be georeferenced with respect \nto the GPS coordinates processed for the GCPs. Depending on the size and shape of the cities, \nthe number of GCPs could vary. In order to maintain planimetric accuracy, referenced satellite \nimages should be resampled using the second order polynomial method to minimize distortions \nand horizontal displacements. The georeferenced images should be confirmed for their control \naccuracy by adopting the baseline distance concept.  \n \n9.  The georeferenced images should be used as a reference frame for referencing the \ncadastry with an appropriate spread and number of registration points. The accuracy of the \nreferenced cadastry should be verified by carrying out GCP matching, as well as through a \nbaseline complementing exercise. \n \n10.  In Georgia, georeferenced and coordinated orthophotos are available and may be used \nas source data. Where satellite images are used to update newly developed areas, the steps \noutlined above may be followed. The town's administrative jurisdiction and UWSCG's service \njurisdiction will define the spatial coverage. \n \n4.  Preparing City Base Maps with Cadastral Control \n11.  The georeferenced cadastral maps should then be digitized using the ArcGIS platform \nfor use as base maps for integration with spatial layers. The final seamless cadastral map \nshould be reproduced at a scale of 1:5000 (or another scale agreed with the government), with \nadministrative boundaries up to the lowest administration boundary level and survey plots, \nenabling local level application. The output should be in a shape file or geodatabase format. The \ncadastral map with individual survey field boundaries at a scale of 1:5000 (or as agreed with the \ngovernment) should be the base map for this activity. The minimum mappable unit should be  \n ", "Appendix 3  11 \n2 mm x 2 mm. The accuracy level of maps at different stages of the operation should consider \nthe following:  \n \n(i)  Thematic layers. In the extraction of thematic layers the location and content \naccuracy should be restricted to 1:5000 scale (or another scale agreed with the \ngovernment). \n(ii)  Layer  integration.  In  an  optimal  grid  system,  seamless  thematic  layers  in \ncadastral scale should use the World Geodetic System (WGS)-84 datum and \nUniversal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. \n \n5.  Deriving Thematic Layers \n12.  Through digital and visual analysis of satellite and aerial data, the following thematic \nlayers (at a minimum mappable unit of 2 mm x 2 mm) should be developed: \n \n(i)  Administrative boundaries. The output should be in cadastral scale and the \nbase  map  should  indicate  the  individual  survey  field  boundaries  with \nadministrative boundaries. \n(ii)  Land use and land cover. Information on land use and land cover and the \npattern of spatial distribution forms the basis for any development planning. The \ncurrent land use trend should be assessed before suggesting alternate land use \npractices.  An  appropriate  urban  land  use  classification  system  based  on \nprevalent planning norms should be derived. The land use categories should also \nconsider built-up land, semi-built-up land and agriculture land. \n(iii)  Surface water bodies. Surface water bodies (including both natural and man-\nmade features, e.g., rivers, streams, canals, lakes, ponds, tanks, and reservoirs) \nshould be categorized. \n(iv)  Settlement areas. Broad settlement areas and individual buildings as discerned \nfrom satellite images should be demarcated and categorized. \n(v)  Assets. Important landmarks (e.g., government offices, other major buildings, \nhospitals,  and  churches)  as  discerned  from  the  satellite  images  should  be \ndemarcated in the asset map.3 \n \n6.  Integrating Thematic Layers \n13.  The derived thematic layers should be integrated with the cadastral map provided with \nadministrative boundaries and survey plots in the GIS domain to enable data retrieval and query \nprocessing at a later stage. The spatial layer information of the project cities will be reproduced \nin a georeferenced cadastral map at a scale of 1:5000 (or as agreed with the government). All \nthematic layers should be in WGS-84 datum and UTM projection. The digital output should be \nsupplied in interoperable shape file and e00 file format for integration with other spatial and non-\nspatial data. Hard copy output in A0 size should be generated to include: \n \n(i)  an administrative map in cadastral scale with individual survey field boundaries, \nadministrative boundaries and survey field numbers; \n(ii)  land  use  and  land  cover  map  showing  urban  land  use  features  including \nresidential, commercial, industrial, transportation, and agricultural land use; \n                                                 \n3  Water supply and sanitation asset information will be captured as a separate activity after establishing the city base \nmap with requisite features. The city base maps will also provide a planning platform for other government \nagencies in the development sector. \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \n(iii)  landform map showing major landform units;. \n(iv)  detailed  road  network  map  showing,  national  highways,  provincial  highways, \ndistrict roads and city roads; \n(v)  individual  high  rise  buildings,  clustered  buildings  (agglomerated  structures), \nsemi-clustered settlements, and sparse settlement areas; \n(vi)  map showing the river courses, aquaculture ponds, canal, ponds, reservoir, tanks, \nwaterlogged areas, marshy land, mud flats, etc; and \n(vii)  major landmark assets (e.g., government offices, other major building complexes, \nhospitals, churches, and stadiums) in the form of polygon features. \n \n7.  Establishing a Water Supply and Sanitation Asset and Consumer Database \n14.  With assistance from UWSCG staff, the TA will map water supply and sanitation assets \nin  both  cities.  Asset  attributes  including  age,  material,  asset  condition,  and  other  relevant \ntechnical specifications will be assigned to the system and mapped as a thematic layer for \nintegration into the GIS domain. A database on asset information will also be generated and \nintegrated with the service utility's management information system (MIS). In addition to data \ncollection,  asset  database  creation  will  include  a  data  conversion  and  encoding  process, \ndefinition of unique feature identities, and linkages to the GIS domain.

The creation of the consumer database will include classifying consumers as residential, \ncommercial or institutional, and recording the following information for each consumer: monthly \nwater consumption levels, location of water meters, monthly water charges, location of sewer \nconnections, and monthly sewerage charges. \n \n8.  Developing a Water Supply and Sanitation Utility Management System for \nAsset Maintenance and Management \n18.  On completion of city base maps with thematic layers and the asset database, the TA \nwill develop WSS utility management software for the service utility that will assist in making \ninformed decisions on future planning, maintenance and management activities. The WSS utility \nmanagement software will be developed to capture and process asset information and provide \nthe service utility with visual and processed data for planning service delivery. The software \nshould be compatible with ArcGIS and should draw from available freeware and ArcGIS-based \napplications for WSS utility management. \n \n9.  Developing Staff Capacity in Utility System Management \n19.  The  TA  will  develop  service  utility  staff  capacity  to  manage  the  water  supply  and \nsanitation asset database and ensure real-time information is available to decision makers in \nthe service utility and the executing agency. The international consultants will provide training to \nservice utility staff. \n \nC.  Staffing \n20.
