The socioeconomic crises caused by the recent outbreaks of SARS (2003) and avian \ninfluenza (2004) in Asia, have served to heighten the awareness of the wide-ranging negative \nimpacts of infectious diseases on human health, food safety, livestock trade, and livelihoods of \npoor  farming  communities.  In  addition  to  these  outbreaks,  continuing  losses  of  livestock \nbelonging  mainly  to  smallholders  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS),  due  to  other \ntransboundary animal diseases (TAD), such as foot and mouth disease (FMD), and classical \nswine fever (CSF), have clearly revealed major weaknesses in the public health and veterinary \nservices. In response to these problems, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Food and \nAgriculture Organization (FAO) have developed a regional technical assistance project,1 which \naims at addressing the fundamental constraints to effective responses to TAD in the region.  \n \n2.  The project was conceived to be carried out in two phases of 2 years each. The first \nphase was implemented in 2005, and is expected to be under implementation until June 2007. \nThe primary objectives of phase I include the establishment of a strong regional cooperation \nmechanism, and initiating the development of national and regional capacities to control TAD. In \nphase  II  of  the  project,  the  expected  outputs  include  improved  knowledge  of  patterns  of \nlivestock trade and movements in the GMS, stronger national and regional diagnostic capacity \nto deal with TADs, and the development of well targeted pilot disease control programs. It is \nexpected that these pilot programs can demonstrate the positive impacts of TAD control, on \nlivelihoods of poor farming communities, and on regional livestock trade in the GMS.  \n \n3.    The current phase of the project has achieved a number of key outputs. These include \namong others, the formal endorsement of a regional collaborative agreement entered into by the \nMinisters of the GMS countries, by the Second GMS Leaders Summit held in July 2005 in \nKunming,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  This  aims  to  control  TAD  through  regional \ncooperation, transparency in disease reporting and mutual support in harmonizing policies and \napproaches to TAD control. Under the current phase, the project training programs on disease \nsurveillance and diagnosis are being undertaken, in order to enhance national and regional \ndisease control capacity. On completion of phase I, it is expected that a significant amount of \nthe groundwork, would have been completed, which is essential in order to embark on targeted \ndisease control programs among poor livestock farming communities, in the Upper and Lower \nMekong Regions of the GMS.  \n \n4.  This TA2 reflects the phase II of the project, and is submitted to seek grant funds to \nsupport a number of follow up activities related to disease control programs to be launched in \nphase II3 (Appendix 1).  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Livestock represent only 15% of the agricultural gross domestic product in Southeast \nAsia, but are a strategic part of the small-farm economy in the region. The demand for livestock \n                                                 \n1  ADB 2004. Technical Assistance to Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \nand Viet Nam, for Transboundary Animal Disease Control in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). Manila (TA \n6192-REG). \n2  The TA was approved for cofinancing by the Government of People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and ADB Technical \nAssistance Special Funds (TASF). The TA was proposed to the meeting of the Regional Community of Practice on \n3 November 2006. The Government of the PRC approved it in November 2006. \n3  The TA is included in the GMS Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program Update (RCSPU) 2006\u20132008. ", "2 \nproducts in the region is projected to grow by 3.5%\u20134.0% annually4 to the year 2020. This \nincrease\u2014predominantly driven by high-income growth, rapid urbanization, and changes in \ndietary patterns\u2014will present clear opportunities for reducing poverty among poor smallholders. \nThis will be achieved by improving their incomes, through commercialization of smallholder \nlivestock production. However, in order to fully participate in these market opportunities, poor \nsmallholders  in  GMS  countries  will  have  to  produce  healthy  and  productive  animals. \nUnfortunately,  they  are  currently  constrained  by  diseases  such  as  FMD,  CSF  and  avian \ninfluenza. The morbidity and mortality rates of livestock due to these diseases are often as high \nas 50%\u201370% in many parts of the GMS.5  \n \n6.  The poor in the developing world face particularly high risk from livestock diseases. \nParticipatory poverty assessment surveys in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) have \nshown that 70% of producers rank animal diseases as a major constraint to their household \nincomes.6 Phase I of the present TA has made progress in bringing about greater recognition of \nthe significance of TADs for poverty reduction, increased regional trade, related food safety and \nhuman health concerns. It has demonstrated the need for regional cooperation in prevention \nand control of TADs. Livelihood surveys have been done in disease control areas in the Upper \nand Lower Mekong region, in order to establish the baseline, for future monitoring of the impacts \nof controlling TADs, on the poor. Controlling such diseases is a strong incentive for regional \ncooperation, and underscores the need for this project.7  \n \n7.  Animal movement and the informal livestock trade, within and between various countries \nin the region, are the major means of transmitting and spreading TAD. Cross-border trade in \nlivestock  among  GMS  countries  is  dynamic  and  rapidly  evolving,  mainly  driven  by  price \ngradients across the subregion. While cattle and buffalo movements in 2003 and 2004 were \nmainly from Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Myanmar, southern \nPRC, and Viet Nam into Thailand, this has significantly changed in the last two years. There is \nnow substantial illegal or informal trade in cattle and buffalo from Cambodia, Lao PDR, and \nMyanmar sometimes via the PRC) into Viet Nam and Thailand. Such informal trade is one of the \nprimary reasons for the spread of TAD. The lack of understanding of the risks of TAD, and fears \namong  smallholders  and  traders,  of  excessive  charges  and  restrictions,  limit  formal \nopportunities  for  regulating  inter-regional  trade  in  livestock  and  livestock  products.  It  is \nnecessary to understand the patterns of livestock movements in the sub region, and identify the \nkey points for TAD control, which is an aim of the proposed project.  \n \n8.   In order to address the complex issues related to the spread and control of TAD, ADB \nand FAO have already developed a 4 year, two-phased, sequential approach to contain TAD. \nPhase I8 of 2 years is currently operational focusing on (i) developing and operationalizing \nstrong regional cooperation, and (ii) developing a harmonized disease information system in the \nregion, and increasing surveillance and diagnostic capacity. Since the inception of phase I in \nmid July 2005, the project has made significant progress in achieving key objectives.9 In phase \nII, the key objective would be to apply the optimal disease control programs in the Upper and \nLower Mekong disease control zones, in order to demonstrate tangible impacts on incomes of \n                                                 \n4  Delgado, C. et al.1999.

The  TA \nsubmitted here is targeted specifically to address these follow-up activities.  \n \n9.   This project is consistent with the goals set out by Greater Mekong Subregion Economic \nCooperation Program that aim to (i) increase regional cooperation among its members, (ii) boost \ntrade, and (iii) initiate interventions that reduce poverty through mutual learning and sharing of \ninformation and technology. The activities of this project are consistent with ADB\u2019s country-\nspecific operations.11  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.     The impacts generated from this project are expected to contribute to the larger goal of \nreducing poverty in poor livestock farming communities in the GMS, through better control of \nTAD, increased production of safer food, and enhanced opportunities for smallholders to access \nhigher value markets, in order to sell their livestock and livestock products.  The specific \noutcomes from the project will include defined and well targeted disease control approaches, \nand improved diagnostic capacity of the national and regional laboratories, to process a large \nnumber of field samples from diseased animals in the region, and provide rapid diagnosis for \nbetter control of TAD. This improved capacity will also facilitate better flow of information on \ndiseases within a country, and between the GMS countries, for better disease control planning. \n(The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.) \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The project will be implemented over a 2\u2013year period between 2007 and 2009, and will \nrun concurrently with other phase II activities of the proposed RETA on Reducing Risk of \nTransboundary Animal Disease for Poverty Reduction in the GMS, which are expected to be \nlaunched through a separate funding source in mid 2007.12 This TA will consist of the following \ncomponents: \n \n12.   Component 1. Participatory Research on Patterns of Livestock Trade and Disease \nControl  in  the  GMS.  Under  this  component,  research  will  be  undertaken  to  identify  the \ndirections and volumes of informal livestock trade, and the key players involved in the trade. \nThis will help to (i) identify optimal ways to introduce TAD awareness programs; and (ii) improve \nregulation of livestock trade with a view to controlling TAD, through better enforcement of health \nchecks on livestock, and access to improved information and databases. A regional research \ninstitute  or  an  NGO,  with  a  strong  background  in  livestock  and  poverty  research  and \ninterventions, will be selected by ADB to carry out the research and analyze data, and prepare \noutputs. The research methodology will include surveys and participatory research. Site visits, \ninterviews  with  key  informants,  focus  group  discussions  with  farmers,  traders,  officials, \n                                                 \n10 Another proposal is being prepared to secure funding from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for support in \ndisease control in the GMS. \n11 For instance, a livestock development project for the Lao PDR is in the pipeline for 2004, and the loan itself for \n2006. This project will also be complementary to a number of ongoing rural and agricultural development projects \nthat have livestock components funded by ADB and other partners, in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam.  \n12 These other activities will include targeted pilot TAD control programs among smallholder farming communities. \n ", "4 \nextension workers, veterinary staff at different levels, will be conducted. Key outputs will include \n(i) in depth analysis of the animal movement patterns within and between the GMS countries, \nparticularly in the Upper and Lower Mekong disease control zones;13 (ii) definition of strategic \npoints along the livestock production chain (farm to markets) for disease control interventions; \nand (iii) a set of recommendations on policy and technical interventions to enhance TAD control \nin the region.  \n \n13.   Component 2: Equipping National and Regional Laboratories for TAD Control. This \ncomponent will identify the essential gaps in diagnostic equipment and human resources, for \neach of the three national diagnostic laboratories of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam, and \nthe FMD regional diagnostic laboratory based in Pak Chong, Thailand. It will equip these \nnational and regional laboratories to support sero-diagnosis of FMD and CSF. Equipment to be \npurchased will include DNA genotyping machines, Elisa readers, centrifuges, biosafety hoods, \nwater purification systems, and computer hardware at local levels. After TA completion, all \nequipment will remain laboratory property for TAD control. Laboratory specific training will be \nprovided in each of the target countries. The methodology and protocols for diagnosis in the \nGMS countries will be harmonized.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The  total  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  $500,000  equivalent.  Of  this  amount, \n$300,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction and Regional \nCooperation Fund, funded by the Government of the PRC, and $150,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA Funding Program. Governments from GMS countries will \nmake in kind contribution equivalent to $50,000 to cover expenses for office accommodation, \ncounterpart staff, part of the costs of training, seminar, and conferences, part of domestic travel, \npart of survey and data gathering, and translation. The TA will be administered by ADB. The \ndetailed cost estimates and proposed financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n    \nD.         Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA activities will be conducted over 24 months, from July 2007 to May 2009. ADB \nwill be the executing agency. The ministries of agriculture in the GMS countries will be the \nimplementing  agencies,  through  their  respective  departments  of  livestock.  Project \nimplementation at the country level will be the responsibility of national project coordinators, \nwho are already identified in each of the participating countries by their respective governments. \nFAO will be selected by ADB through single source selection, to implement the project and \ndeliver  the  required  services.14  FAO  has  the  necessary  expertise  at  global,  regional,  and \nnational levels, to provide technical and operational services to the project. In addition to FAO, \nADB will recruit all consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The \ninternational and national consultants will be based in the FAO office in Bangkok. All material \nand  equipment  procurement  will  be  conducted  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2006, as amended from time to time).15 \n \n                                                 \n13 The Upper and Lower Mekong disease control zones have been designated as such by the OIE and have been \napproved by the GMS countries. These zones include selected provinces in all the GMS countries. \n14 As described in the ADB-FAO. 1981. Memorandum of Understanding.   \n15  Equipment to be procured will include laboratory equipment such as DNA genotyping machines, Elisa Readers, \ncentrifuges, bio safety hoods, water purification systems, and computer hardware for TADs information systems at \nprovincial and district levels. After completion of the TA, the equipment will remain as property of the laboratories \nfor continued TAD prevention and control programs. \n ", "5 \n16.  The  project  steering  committee  comprising  one  expert  representing  each  of  the \ndepartments  of  livestock  from  the  5  GMS  participating  countries,  ADB,  FAO,  OIE,  and \nAssociation  for  Southeast  Asian  Nations,  will  provide  overall  guidance  and  oversight  and \nimplementation guidelines to the project. A project management office headed by a project \ncoordinator/chief technical adviser (PC/CTA), will be located in FAO\u2019s Regional Office for Asia \nand the Pacific (FAO-RAP), in Bangkok, to coordinate project activities. Project management \nunits headed by national project coordinators in the DMCs, which have been set up during \nphase I of the project, will continue to coordinate and implement project activities. The project \nimplementation arrangements and organogram is in Appendix 3. The TA will finance 2 person\u2013\nmonths  of  international  expertise  (PC/CTA)  and  2  person\u2013months  of  national  consultancy \n(communications  specialist).16  The  international  and  national  consultants  will  be  selected \nthrough single source selection, due to reasons of continuity with the ongoing phase I activities. \nADB will use the quality-based selection method to recruit the consultants for the follow up \nsurveys through a firm. National consultants will be used. Simplified technical proposal will be \nrequired.  Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n17.  FAO  will  disseminate  the  expected  outputs  through  the  project  website,  regular \nnewsletters, quarterly and annual reports, consultant reports, reviews and terminal reports. \nPublic awareness campaigns in all the identified regions will be set up to ensure sensitization of \nthe target farmers in villages and communes.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and (ii) ADB \nproviding  the  balance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $150,000  on  a  grant  basis,  for \nTransboundary  Animal  Disease  Control  for  Poverty  Reduction  in  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n16 In addition to these person\u2013months of consulting services, further consultant support will be needed for the project.  \nIt is expected that ADB will be able to bring on board more consulting services through other funding sources. \nThese are being worked out at present. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance        Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \n \n     \nPoverty reduction in poor \nReduced livestock  National livestock policy  \u2022  More advanced GMS \nlivestock farming \ndisease incidence in poor  documents.  countries assist the less \ncommunities in the GMS \nthrough better control of  livestock farming    advanced \nTAD, food safety  communities  OIE and FAO reports of   \nimprovements, enhanced    diseases in the GMS  \u2022  GMS cooperation \nopportunities for  Increased farm incomes  countries.  remains strong \nsmallholders to access  in the target disease \n    \nhigher value markets.  control zones \nLivelihood research reports.  \u2022  National governments \n  commitment is high for \nEx-post impact assessment of  TAD control. \ndisease control programs. \n \n    Assumptions \nOutcome \n   \n \n1.
