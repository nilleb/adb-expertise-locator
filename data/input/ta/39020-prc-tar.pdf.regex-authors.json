During  the  2005  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) confirmed its request for technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to prepare the Energy Conservation and Resource Management \nProject.1 In July 2005, the Fact-Finding Mission was fielded to assess the results of available \nstudies and determine the scope of the TA. The Mission held discussions with representatives \nfrom the Government and concerned provincial government officials. An understanding was \nreached  on  the  TA  goals,  purpose,  scope,  cost  estimates,  financing  and  implementation \narrangements,  and  the  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference.  The TA is included in the country \npipeline for 2005. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The increased use of energy to fuel the economic growth of the PRC economy has \ncontributed significantly to increased environmental pollution: in the power sector, because of its \nheavy  dependence  on  coal-fired  power  generation  and  limited  investment  in  appropriate \nenvironmental  abatement  technology;  and  in  the  industry  sector,  because  of  obsolete \nproduction processes and reliance on coal. The PRC has abundant coal resources, which are \nrelatively inexpensive to produce. In 2004 about 1.9 billion tons of coal was produced, of which \nabout 50% was used for power generation. According to official data, emissions of major air \npollutants peaked in 1995 and subsequently declined. This decline was mainly the result of \nindustry sector restructuring, closure of state-owned enterprises, trade liberalization, energy \nefficiency, and the use of cleaner production technologies. Because energy efficiency has \nimproved, emissions of carbon dioxide (CO ) are less than were projected in the early 1990s. In \n2\nrecent years, however, air pollution has been picking up again and is a serious problem, \nconsidering that more than 63% of the major cities do not meet the Grade II national air quality \nstandards. \n \n3.  The demand for energy in the PRC will continue to increase in the future, with projected \neconomic growth rates of around 8% per annum; a low level of per capita energy consumption, \nwhich  is  about  one  tenth  of  that  of  the  United  States  (for  instance,  current  electricity \nconsumption by households is only about 4% of electricity consumption by households in the \nUnited States); an emerging high rate of motorization in the transport sector; and a rapid \nurbanization process to accommodate a minimum of 10 to 12 million rural emigrants a year. \n \n4.  PRC\u2019s  energy  sector  will  continue  to  be  characterized  by  a  high  level  of  coal \nconsumption that meets about 63% of its primary commercial energy demand, a large number \nof persons involved in coal production and transportation, and an extensive coal infrastructure. \nA significant and rapid shift away from coal in the medium term is unlikely due to the limited oil \nand gas reserves and potential for further development of its hydropower resources. Using the \nmost optimistic scenario of increased use of domestically produced natural gas, importation of \nliquefied natural gas (LNG), and timely construction of the required natural gas distribution \nnetworks, it is expected that the share of natural gas in the primary commercial energy mix \ncould reach only 10% by 2020. \n \n5.   With the economy expected to maintain rapid growth over the coming years, a steep \ndecline in pollution intensity (pollution caused per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) will be \nnecessary if emissions are to be kept at current levels. Industrial pollution intensities, pollution \nloads, and contamination of the ambient environment will most certainly increase unless the \nGovernment\u2019s  pollution  abatement  incentives  are  adjusted.  At  present,  environmental  and \nhealth costs associated with the use of coal are not internalized; in other words, there is no level \nplaying field for other more environment-friendly fuels, such as natural gas and renewable \nenergy vis-\u00e0-vis coal. Increasing the minimum height of smokestacks for coal-fired plants, and \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 15 April 2005. ", "2 \nintroducing market-based instruments (such as taxation of coal use and use of sulfur dioxide \n[SO ] emission trading permits) would contribute to leveling the field. \n2\n \n6.  Pollution caused by the use of coal is aggravated by the relatively high energy intensity \nof PRC\u2019s economy, which requires about 3.8 times more energy per unit of economic output \nthan the world average. The situation is mainly due to (i) ongoing development of energy \nefficiency standards and inadequate enforcement of existing ones, (ii) inefficient energy price \nsignals  for  consumers,  (iii)  low  investments  in  energy-efficient  technologies  and  practices, \n(iv) relatively large contribution of energy-intensive production of fixed assets to GDP, (v) lack of \na legal and regulatory framework to adopt effective demand-side management (DSM) policies, \nand (vi) need for capacity building in energy conservation at local and national levels.  \n \n7.  The Government has recognized that the potential for energy conservation in the PRC is \nenormous and will provide considerable benefits in terms of reduced use of energy resources, \nreduced financing requirements for new energy supply projects, increased security of energy \nsupply,  and  reduced  emissions  associated  with  increasing  energy  consumption.  The \nGovernment has therefore set as a broad target to quadruple GDP between 2000 and 2020, but \nonly  to  double  energy  consumption  during  this  period.  In  January  2005,  the  National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission (NDRC) published the China Medium- and Long-Term \nEnergy  Conservation  Plan.  The  plan  aims  to  give  priority  to  energy  conservation  over \ndevelopment of new sources of energy to fuel PRC\u2019s economic growth, and targets an average \nannual reduction of 2.2% in energy intensity from 2003 to 2010. Energy conservation is to be \nachieved in all major industries and specific key projects have been identified in industries such \nas retrofit projects, energy system optimization projects, construction of cogeneration power \nplants and energy-efficient buildings, DSM projects, and capacity building for promoting and \nimplementing energy conservation projects.  \n \n8.  The PRC has already been very successful in achieving energy savings in industrial \nboilers and energy-intensive industries such as steel, cement, and chemicals that contributed to \na 70% decrease in energy consumption per unit of economic output between 1980 and 1998. \nThose industries have also been targeted under the China Medium- and Long-Term Energy \nConservation Plan for further energy savings through the installation of more energy-efficient \nboilers, equipment, and production processes following the introduction and implementation of \ncorresponding  stricter  energy  efficiency  standards.  As  recognized  in  the  plan,  there  is \nconsiderable potential for energy conservation through DSM programs. In this context, DSM \nrefers to a set of tools and practices to decrease the cost of meeting consumers\u2019 demand for \nelectricity through investments that enable better management of the electricity load on the grid \nand more efficient use of electricity by the end users. In particular, DSM programs aim to reduce \nthe peak demand for electricity\u2014which requires power generation capacity that is used only \nwhen the daily peak occurs\u2014through load management and by promoting the use of more \nenergy-efficient equipment and appliances by electricity consumers. \n \n9.  DSM programs are not yet being implemented in the PRC on a large scale, but studies \ndone so far have found that (i) the potential for cost-effective DSM is very large, (ii) the cost of \nmeeting PRC\u2019s demand for additional power through investments in both DSM and new power \ngeneration  capacity  is  less  than  the  cost  of  meeting  such  demand  through  new  power \ngeneration capacity and new power transmission and distribution systems only, (iii) DSM is fully \nconsistent with PRC\u2019s goal for sustainable development of its energy sector, (iv) DSM is a \nproven and effective method for immediately addressing anticipated power shortages in the \nPRC, and (v) successful implementation of DSM in the PRC will require the adoption of policies \nand rules that support DSM and make it an integral part of power sector reform and power \nsector planning.2  \n \n                                                 \n2 For instance, it is estimated that enforcement of improved energy efficiency standards and introduction of incentives \nfor DSM would make the construction of new power generation capacity of 100 gigawatts up to 2020 unnecessary. ", "  3 \n10.  ADB has financed an initial study of the DSM potential in Jiangsu province. It was found \nthat  an  investment  of  $220  million  for  installing  and  using  high-efficiency  commercial \ncooling/lighting equipment, industrial motor drive systems, and residential appliances, which is \nalso referred to as \u201cthe efficiency power plant (EPP) project concept\u201d will obviate the installation \nof new power generation capacity of 600 megawatts. In general, it is estimated that such energy \nconservation projects would make additional electricity available at 25% less than its present \ncost.  However,  to  move  such  an  EPP  project  concept  forward,  an  appropriate  policy  and \nregulatory  framework  has  to  be  developed.  The  framework  should  provide  incentives  for \nelectricity suppliers and consumers to install energy-efficient equipment and appliances, fairly \ndistribute  costs  and  benefits  between  electricity  suppliers  and  consumers,  establish  a \nmechanism for (partial) financing of energy-efficient equipment and appliances and collecting \npayments from beneficiaries, and set implementation and verification rules for EPP projects. \n \n11.  Findings of studies carried out so far indicate that it is crucial for successful initiation and \nimplementation of an EPP project to overcome market barriers. In this regard the preferred \noption is for local power transmission and distribution companies to provide the energy-efficient \nequipment and appliances to the various consumers, with a subsidy as compensation for the \nhigher cost of the more energy-efficient equipment and appliances and the surrender of the \nequipment and appliances in use, and subsequently recover this subsidy cost from an additional \ncharge in the electricity tariff for energy conservation.3 Alternatively, energy services companies \n(ESCOs) could provide energy-efficient equipment for relatively large electricity consumers and \nrecover their investment for a service charge levied on them. Based on studies already done \nand  detailed  available  information  about  the  economic  benefits  and  financial  costs  of \nimplementing EPP projects in the PRC, an EPP demonstration project can be developed only if \nat the same time national policy and regulatory issues are addressed to ensure that appropriate \nincentives for all parties to undertake such an EPP project will be provided, including a fair \ndistribution of its obvious economic benefits among the national and provincial governments, \ninvestors, suppliers of electricity, and beneficiaries. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The objective of the TA is to assist NDRC identify various options and corresponding \nrequirements for the development of an appropriate policy and regulatory framework to promote \nand  implement  EPP  projects.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  the  establishment  of  such  a \nframework. The TA will also prepare the general design for a demonstration EPP project in a \nspecific province in the PRC, including an estimate of its economic and financial cost and \nbenefits, and recommend implementation and financing arrangements for such a project.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  Adoption of the TA recommendations will promote EPP projects and the prefeasibility \nstudy will allow the development of an EPP demonstration project. Also, staff of concerned \nagencies will be trained in conducting energy conservation surveys that will provide the required \ntechnical information for preparing other EPP projects. The TA will comprise two parts. In part A \n(options for establishing a policy and regulatory framework for EPP projects), consultants will \nassist the Power Division of the Economic Operations Bureau (PDEOB) of NDRC with identifying \nvarious  options  and  corresponding  requirements  for  developing  an  appropriate  policy  and \nregulatory framework to promote the implementation of EPP projects. In part B (prefeasibility \nstudy for an EPP demonstration project), consultants will assist a particular Provincial Economic \nand Trade Commission (PETC) in preparing a prefeasibility study for the development of an EPP \ndemonstration project. Part B will be in two phases. During phase 1, the consultants will review \navailable data, gather additional data through a survey, and, in consultation with NDRC, identify a \n                                                 \n3  Such a charge for energy conservation in the electricity tariff has been adopted in many countries, but is not used \nin the People\u2019s Republic of China. ", "4 \nprovince where an EPP demonstration project is to be developed and the economic benefits of an \nEPP demonstration project would be the highest.  During phase 2, the consultants will prepare a \nprefeasibility  study  for  developing  an  EPP  demonstration  project  in  the  selected  province, \nidentify the required assistance for capacity building and institutional strengthening programs at \nthe  provincial  level  to  ensure  successful  implementation  of  the  EPP  project,  and  identify \npossible funding sources for such assistance. During TA implementation, two workshops will be \nheld to simultaneously discuss the findings and recommendations of the consultants for parts A \nand B. The first workshop will be held at the completion of phase 1 of part B of the TA and will \ndiscuss  the  initial  findings  of  the  consultants  with  regard  to  options  and  corresponding \nrequirements for developing an appropriate policy and regulatory framework to promote the \nimplementation of EPP projects as well as views with regard to the preferred province for which a \nprefeasibility study for an EPP demonstration project is to be prepared. The second workshop will \nbe held at the end of the TA to discuss the findings and recommendations of the consultants \nwith regard to the development of an appropriate policy and regulatory framework for EPP \nprojects and the prefeasibility study for an EPP demonstration project in a province as agreed \nupon with NDRC. The workshops will be organized by the consultants recruited for part A and \nwill  be  attended  by  organizations  and  parties  interested  in  the  EPP  concept:  government \norganizations and concerned policy makers at the national and provincial levels and other \nrelevant government agencies in the province where the EPP demonstration project is to be \ndeveloped,  and  aid  agencies.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  in \nAppendix 2. \n \n14.   Key activities in part A will include (i) reviewing the Government policies, practices, and \ntargets to promote energy conservation; (ii) evaluating the EPP concept and its implementation \nin other countries; (iii) reviewing the present electricity tariff structure and annual government \nreview and adjustment procedures; (iv) assessing the economic benefits of using the EPP \nconcept in selected areas in the PRC where the potential for energy conservation by small \nelectricity users is high; (v) identifying possible government policies and regulations that would \nbe needed to provide adequate incentives for adopting the EPP concept in those areas; and \n(vi) prioritizing options for such a policy and regulatory framework and actions to be taken by the \nGovernment for its development. \n \n15.  Key activities in part B, will include (i) reviewing available data and surveys in connection \nwith the development of an EPP demonstration project; (ii) selecting a particular province for the \nEPP demonstration project; (iii) assessing areas where further critical survey is to be conducted, \nand  training  staff  in  conducting  additional  surveys;  (iv) identifying  priority  areas  within  the \nselected province where the development of an EPP demonstration project would provide the \nhighest economic and financial benefits to the PRC and the concerned province; (v) assessing \nthe  general  scope  and  components  of  such  an  EPP  demonstration  project,  and  its  cost, \nfinancing requirements, and economic and financial viability and sustainability; (vi) assessing \nthe social and environmental benefits of an EPP demonstration project; (vii) identifying required \nimplementation  arrangements;  and  (viii)  assessing  the  required  capacity  building  and \ninstitutional strengthening. \n \n16.  The  major  risks  in  the  successful  implementation  of  the  TA  include  inadequate \ncounterpart support, inadequate data and its untimely provision, delayed submission of required \nstudies, delayed consultant selection, and poor consultant performance. In addition, support by \nnational and concerned provincial governments and their participation in the workshops are \nnecessary. Efforts will be made to ensure timely recruitment of competent international and \ndomestic consultants. Close coordination among the consultants, executing and implementing \nagencies, and ADB will mitigate the risks. It is understood that implementation of the TA does \nnot commit any party to provide further financial or other assistance required for developing an \nEPP demonstration project. \n \n \n ", "  5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $850,000  equivalent  (Appendix  3).  ADB  will  provide \n$600,000 equivalent on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. NDRC will contribute \n$250,000 equivalent, representing about 33% of the total TA cost. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  PDEOB will be the Executing Agency for parts A and B, while the concerned PETC will \nact as Implementing Agency for part B. ADB will select and engage the services of international \nand domestic consultants according to its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Consultants for \npart A, will have expertise in developing of policies and regulatory frameworks to promote \nenergy conservation, energy economics, electricity pricing and tariff development, and DSM \nactivities,  including  application  of  the  EPP  concept.  An  estimated  21  person-months  of \nconsulting services will be required for part A\u20143 international and 18 domestic. Consultants for \npart B, will have expertise in developing and monitoring DSM projects, financial and economic \nanalyses, social and environmental aspects of energy conservation, and capacity building and \ninstitutional  strengthening  for  energy  conservation.  An  estimated  27  person-months  of \nconsulting services 7 international and 20 of domestic will be required. The international and \ndomestic consultants for parts A and B will be provided by a firm that will be selected separately \nfor each part following the submission of simplified technical proposals and the use of the \nquality- and cost-based selection method. The TA is expected to begin in early March 2006 and \nbe completed by December 2006. \n \n19.  PDEOB will assign two counterpart staff to work with the consultants on a daily basis. \nFor part B, NDRC will cause the concerned PETC to establish a provincial steering committee \ncomprising  representatives  from  the  Provincial  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  the \nProvincial Finance Bureau, and the Provincial Pricing Bureau to review and discuss policy, \nregulatory, and economic aspects of the proposed EPP demonstration project, in consultation \nwith PDEOB. For this purpose, the latter will organize regular meetings with the provincial steering \ncommittee during TA implementation. NDRC will also cause the concerned PETC to establish a \nworking group comprising representatives from PETC, the provincial power transmission and \ndistribution company, DSM Center, regional electricity distribution companies, and concerned \nmunicipal governments to work closely with the consultants; and to assign two staff of the \nworking group to work with the consultants daily. The working group will report directly to the \nprovincial steering committee on the progress of part B of the TA, and the committee will advise \nPDEOB of the same. PDEOB and the concerned PETC will jointly organize the two workshops \nfor the TA, which will be held in Beijing. PDEOB will provide interpreters, local transportation, \nand office space with suitable facilities in Beijing, while NDRC will cause the concerned PETC to \nprovide the same for the consultants during their work in the concerned provincial capital. \nComputers  and  other  office  equipment  financed  under  the  TA  will  be  procured  by  the \ninternational economist in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and transferred to \nPDEOB after completion of the TA. \n \n        IV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Energy Conservation and Resource \nManagement, and hereby reports this action to the Board.

Options for Establishing a Policy and Regulatory Framework for Efficiency Power \nPlant (EPP) Projects (Part A) \n \n  1.   Background   \n \n1.  In part A of the technical assistance (TA), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will select \nand engage the services of international and domestic consultants according to its Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants. The main objective of part A is to identify various options and \ncorresponding  requirements  for  the  development  of  an  appropriate  policy  and  regulatory \nframework to promote and enable the implementation of efficiency power plant (EPP) projects in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).
