The \nfund  is  targeting  capital  commitments  of  $250  million  and  is \norganized as a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership. The \nfund is managed by UOB Capital Partners (the fund manager), \nwhich is assisted by UOB Venture Management ([UOBVM], the \nfund advisor). The fund will have a term of 8 years from its final \nclosing. \n   \nImpact, Outcome, and  The impact of the project will be a contribution to the regional trade \nBenefits  and  investment  among  ASEAN  countries  and  between  ASEAN \ncountries and the PRC, and the demonstration effect of the fund \nleading to improved private capital flows to the SME sector in ADB \nDMCs. \n \nThe outcome of the project will be improved access to finance \nresulting in increased SME activity in ADB developing member \ncountries (DMCs). \n \nThe output of the project will be the establishment of the fund as \nplanned  in  this  proposal  to  identify,  screen,  and  evaluate \ninvestment opportunities, and make financially viable investments \nover time.  \n \n \n \n ", "ii     \n \nRisks and Mitigating  This investment will be subject to risks normally associated with \nMeasures  equity  investments  of  this  nature  such  as:  (i)  suitability  of \ninvestment strategy; (ii) risks from competition with other funds; (iii) \nrisks from insufficient management resources; (iv) risk associated \nwith potential conflicts of interest; (v) risks from difficulty in exiting \ninvestment positions; (vi) currency risks;  (vii) political, economic \nand  social  risks;  (viii)  risks  associated  with  accounting  and \ndisclosure  standards  that  do  not  accord  with  international \nstandards;  and  (ix)  risks  from  changing  legal  and  regulatory \nenvironments.    ADB  has  considered  or  defined  the  necessary \nsteps to address and mitigate these risks. \n   \nJustification / ADB  ADB's support to this transaction is justified with a range of value \nValue-Added  additions to the fund. First, ADB's investment will act as a catalyst \nin raising funds. As a result of the current challenging fund raising \nenvironment, the fund manager is finding it difficult to raise the \nrequired capital for this fund. ADB's participation will send a strong \nsignal  to  the  market  and  enable  the  fund  to  reach  its  desired \ncapitalization. Second, ADB\u2019s new sets of environment and social \nsafeguard policies and procedures will be crucial in enriching the \ngovernance  of  the  fund.  These  policies  will  enable  the  fund \nmanager to integrate best practices with regard to environmental \nand social standards in the investee SMEs in the DMCs. Third, \nADB can provide additional support to the fund in understanding \nthe regional market dynamics through ADB\u2019s multifaceted links to \nvarious governments and institutions in the region. This will enable \nthe fund manager to appropriately assess future engagements and \narrive at an accurate and informed investment decision. ", "       \n \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment in the ASEAN China Investment Fund II of up to $25 million or 25% of the \nfund's total share capital, whichever is less.  \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Economic and Sector Background \n2.  Over  the  past  decade,1 Asia  has  become  an  increasingly  attractive  destination  for \ninvestors  due  to  the  region\u2019s  rapid  economic  growth,  comprehensive  reforms,  structural \nchanges, and increasing globalization.2 However, as a result of the recent economic crisis, a \nnumber of the export-oriented Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)3 economies \nhave been hit hard, and their recovery has been slow. There is still considerable uncertainty \nabout the duration of the economic slowdown and the extent to which Asia will be affected.  \n \n3.  Asia has become more deeply integrated with global financial markets. As a result of the \nfinancial crisis, such integration has led to the tightening of Asian credit markets. In assessing \nthe current situation, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Asian Development Outlook 20094 \ncites that, considering its robust domestic demand, the People's Republic of China (PRC) has \nan important role in the region's recovery. The impact of this crisis to Asia can still be cushioned \nby enhancing trade flow between the PRC and the smaller economies in the region. In light of \nthis scenario, the fund's strategy of investing in companies that will promote greater economic \nand trade links between ASEAN and the PRC becomes even more important.  \n \n4.  Status  of  ASEAN\u2013PRC  economic  relations. Regional cooperation and integration \namong its member and neighboring countries is one of the crosscutting strategic themes of \nASEAN. The association is focused on promoting regional growth and economic integration, \nincluding economic and policy reforms and investment incentives. ASEAN also facilitates fast-\ntrack trade liberalization within the ASEAN free trade area. Appendix 2 gives key economic \nfeatures of ASEAN and the PRC. \n \n5.  The PRC is increasingly becoming a major economic power in the region. It has twice \nthe land area of ASEAN, it is roughly 2.3 times larger than ASEAN in terms of population, and \nits  gross  domestic  product  is  approximately  2.25  times  that  of  ASEAN.  Also,  the  PRC's \neconomic  liberalization  and  its  membership  in  the  World  Trade  Organization  are  further \nenhancing ASEAN\u2013PRC trade and investment opportunities. Trade between ASEAN and the \nPRC increased by 22 times between 1991 and 2008, with the volume reaching $193 billion in \n2008.5   \n \n6.  In 2008, the PRC became the third-largest trading partner of ASEAN, behind Japan and \nthe European Union, and overtook the United States, which was fourth.4 This statistical finding \nshows the increased exposure and significance of the PRC in the ASEAN trade area. Exploiting \n                                                 \n1  From 1995\u20132008. ADB. 2009. Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2009.

ASEAN\u2013PRC agreement on trade has evolved over the years. In November 2002, the \nframework agreement for the ASEAN\u2013PRC free trade area was signed at the eighth ASEAN \nsummit meeting in Cambodia. The framework agreement committed ASEAN and the PRC to \nnegotiate the liberalization and promotion of trade in goods and services between them. An \nannouncement on bilateral investment was released on 15 August 2009; it stated that the PRC \ncommerce minister, Chen Deming, and the economic ministers from 10 ASEAN members \nsigned the ASEAN\u2013China Investment Agreement during the 41st ASEAN Economic Ministers \nMeeting. The signing of the investment agreement, together with the previously signed PRC\u2013\nASEAN agreements of the trade in goods and services, completed the negotiation process of a \nPRC\u2013ASEAN free trade area, which started on 1 January 2010. This agreement envisions \"to \npromote  investment  flows  and  to  create  liberal,  facilitative,  transparent  and  competitive \ninvestment regimes\" for both ASEAN and the PRC through defined mechanisms such as, \namong other things, improving the transparency of investment rules conducive to increased \ninvestment flows.6 \n \nB.  Investment Identification and Description \n8.  In 2004, ADB made a $15 million investment in the ASEAN China Investment Fund \n(ACIF I).7 ADB has thus known the fund manager for over 5 years and has developed a close \nrelationship with the team through this investment. There are other regional funds in existence \nthat could also represent worthy investment targets. However, based on the alignment of this \nfund with ADB's regional trade and integration strategies, and on the positive economic and \ndevelopment  outcomes  of  ACIF  I  investment,  ADB  feels  confident  contemplating  ongoing \nsupport for a fund manager that ADB helped to promote before.  \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n9.  Strategy 2020 identifies private sector development as a key driver of change, and \nfinance sector development as one of five core specializations that support ADB\u2019s agenda.8 \nStrategy 2020 focuses on three strategic priorities: inclusive economic growth, environmentally \nsustainable  development,  and  regional  integration.  In  addition,  Strategy  2020  emphasizes \nprivate  sector  development  as  a  means  to  achieve  sustainable  and  inclusive  growth.  The \nrelationship of the fund to each of the priorities and drivers of change is summarized as follows: \n \n1.  Strategy 2020 Priorities \n(i)  Inclusive  economic  growth.  The  fund  provides  much-needed  growth \ncapital for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in ASEAN and the \nPRC. Such companies play a vital role in generating employment and \nsupporting inclusive economic growth. \n                                                 \n6  ASEAN  Secretariat.  2009.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Equity Investment in \nthe ASEAN China Investment Fund. Manila. \n8  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. ", "  3\n(ii)  Environmentally  sustainable  development.  The  fund  systematically \nscreens and monitors all investee companies for compliance with ADB, \nWorld  Bank,  and  International  Labor  Organization  environmental  and \nsocial  guidelines,  and  for  compliance  with  corporate  governance  best \npractices. In addition, the fund introduces investee companies to such \nguidelines and standards, as well as compliance procedures. \n \n(iii)  Regional  integration.  The  fund  provides  growth  capital  to  SMEs  in \nASEAN  and  the  PRC,  particularly  those  that  can  benefit  from  the \ncontinuing expansion of regional trade and investment between ASEAN \nmember  states  and  the  PRC,  and  their  respective  overseas  trading \npartners. The fund enables the investee companies to list their shares on \na regional stock exchange, thus contributing to regional integration as well \nas capital markets development. \n \n2.  Strategy 2020 Drivers of Change  \n(i)  Private sector operations. The fund provides a mechanism to attract \nmuch-needed responsible and sustainable private investment to ASEAN \nand the PRC. The fund catalyzes investment on two levels: firstly, through \ndirect investment in private companies, and secondly, by helping such \ncompanies to tap the public capital markets, typically by means of a stock \nexchange listing. \n \n(ii)  Gender equity. The fund is expected to be an important source of job \ncreation for women, particularly in SMEs. The fund monitors the labor \npractices and conditions of its investee companies. Such monitoring helps \nto  detect  and  correct  instances  of  gender-based  discrimination  and/or \nharassment (both of which are major impediments to hiring and retaining \nemployees,  particularly  women,  in  the  workforce),  and  ensure  that \ninvestee companies do not use child labor. \n \n(iii)  Partnerships. The fund provides a mechanism for ADB to partner with \nlike-minded investors from both the private and public sectors, who seek \nto promote responsible and sustainable private enterprise development in \nASEAN and the PRC. \n \n10.  Finally, this project aligns well with ADB's prior investment with the fund manager to \npromote SME lending and the above-mentioned ADB sector strategies, and represents a good \nfit for ADB's involvement. \n \nD.  Development Impact \n11.  In this transaction, ADB's investment in the fund is intended in the long term to help \nincrease regional trade, economic growth, and private sector development in Asia. This set of \nlinkages, as detailed in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1), can be understood \nas follows: \n \n(i)  Impact. The impact of the project will be a contribution to regional trade and \ninvestment among ASEAN countries and between ASEAN countries and the \n ", "4 \nPRC, and the demonstration effect of the fund leading to improved private capital \nflows to the SME sector in ADB DMCs. \n \n(ii)  Outcome.  The  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  improved  access  to  finance \nresulting  in  increased  SME  activity  in  ADB  developing  member  countries \n(DMCs).   \n \n(iii)  Output.  The  output  of  the  project  will  be  the  establishment  of  the  fund  as \nplanned  in  this  proposal  to  identify,  screen,  and  evaluate  investment \nopportunities, and make financially viable investments over time.  \n \n \n12.  The project will promote development in a number of ways, including (i) promoting closer \neconomic and trade links between ASEAN and the PRC; (ii) developing SMEs, which will \nbenefit from such links; (iii) deepening regional capital markets; (iv) helping to promote balanced \ndevelopment and reduce the risks associated with overdependence on a limited number of \ntraditional  export  markets;  (v)  transforming  investee  companies  by  helping  them  to  adopt \nfinancially prudent and sustainable business practices and internationally accepted standards; \nand (vi) catalyzing the mobilization of long-term capital from institutional investors from both \nwithin  and  outside  the  region.  See  Appendix  8  for  Environmental  and  Social  Governance \nImprovements of ACIF I Portfolio Companies.  \n \nIII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY  \nA.  Sponsor and Ownership \n13.  Sponsor. The United Overseas Bank (UOB) is the fund sponsor and is the lead investor \nwith a capital commitment of $30 million. UOB was incorporated in August 1935 as the United \nChinese Bank and has grown over the last 73 years. Through a series of acquisitions, it became \na leading bank in Singapore, with banking subsidiaries in the region. Today the UOB has a \nnetwork of over 500 offices in 18 countries and territories in Asia and the Pacific, Western \nEurope, and North America. UOB provides a wide range of financial services through its global \nnetwork  of  branches  and/or  offices  and  subsidiaries\u2014personal  financial  services,  private \nbanking,  trust  services,  commercial  and  corporate  banking,  investment  banking,  corporate \nfinance,  capital  market  activities,  treasury  services,  asset  management,  venture  capital \nmanagement, general insurance, and life insurance. UOB is rated among the world's top banks \nby Moody's Investors Service, receiving ratings as of 31 December 2007 of B for financial \nstrength, Aa1 for long-term deposits, and Prime-1 for short-term deposits. As of 31 December \n2007, UOB had total assets of approximately $122 billion.  \n \n14.  In 2007, UOB further expanded its operations in Asia. It received approval to incorporate \nthe United Overseas Bank (China) in the PRC, and it also completed the acquisition of a 10% \nstake in the Southern Commercial Joint Stock Bank in Viet Nam. The core strengths of UOB lie \nin its market knowledge of Asia, consumer and SME banking expertise, and proven technology, \nrisk management, and corporate governance framework. \n \n15.  Ownership. The fund will be owned by its investors (including ADB). Commitments \nand/or interests in the fund thus far include $30 million from UOB, a substantial commitment ", "  5\nfrom the China Development Bank (CDB), and up to $10 million from Proparco.9 Further fund \ninvestor commitment details are provided in Para. 33. \n \nB.  Governance Structure \n1.  Management  \n16.  The fund will be managed by UOB Capital Partners (the fund manager). The fund \nmanager is wholly owned by UOB Global Capital, a member of the UOB, and Westmount \nPacific, an affiliate of Westmount Asset Management, a registered investment adviser in the \nUnited States. UOB Global Capital owns 70% of the fund manager and Westmount Pacific owns \n30%.  \n \n17.  The fund manager will engage the UOB's wholly owned venture capital affiliate, UOB \nVenture Management (UOBVM) to provide specialized investment advisory services to the fund. \nUOBVM will be responsible for all investment and divestment activities of the fund. UOBVM has \nextensive private equity, venture capital, and direct business operating experience, as well as a \ndemonstrated ability to operate effectively in the region's multicultural environment. Appendix 3 \nprovides the fund's structure and organizational relationships. \n \n2.  Corporate Governance \n18.  Board of directors. The fund manager will be governed by a board of directors. The \ninitial directors of the fund manager will be Kie Cheong Chong, Kian-Wee Seah, Robert A. \nBerliner, David T. Goss, and Michael Landau. Appendix 4 provides the biographical data for the \ninitial directors of the fund manager. \n \n19.  Advisory board. The fund will have an advisory board, consisting of representatives of \nthe fund investors with commitments of at least $20 million. The fund manager will exercise its \ndiscretion in inviting certain fund investors with capital commitments of less than $20 million to \nbe also represented on the advisory board. The advisory board will represent the interests of the \ninvestors, and advise and provide guidance to the fund manager on matters related to fund \noperations, governance, and conflicts of interest. ADB will have a seat on the advisory board. \n \n20.  Investment committee. The fund will establish an investment committee to review and \nmake decisions on the acquisition and divestment of proposed investments. The fund manager \nwill not pursue any investments or cause the fund to enter into any transaction in the event of a \nnegative recommendation by the investment committee. The committee will consist of one \nindependent member other than the UOBVM investment professionals. To avoid any potential \nconflicts of interest, the independent member of the investment committee will have veto rights \nover investment approvals. \n \n3.  Risk Management \n21.  For private equity funds, risk management can be understood as the process by which \nthe fund in question selects, analyzes, structures, and exits investments, i.e., the investment \nprocess and policies that aim to identify risks, balance those risks against the anticipated \nreturns of the investment, and mitigate the risks to the extent possible. A key element in \n                                                 \n9  Proparco, set up in 1977, is the French Development Finance Institution specializing in capital investments, loans, \nand guarantees. \n ", "6 \nachieving this fund's investment goals is the implementation of a rigorous investment process \nby the fund manager.  \n \n22.  Investment process. The investment process used for ACIF I has been refined over the \npast several years, while retaining the disciplines that have proven successful. This proven \ninvestment process will be used for this fund. The investment process can be briefly described \nas follows: (i) deal sourcing, (ii) an exploratory memo seeking approval of the management of \nUOBVM, (iii) investment opportunity due diligence, (iv) investment appraisal for the investment \ncommittee, and (v) fund manager's approval.  \n \n23.  Investment policies. The fund manager also has a set of policies that it uses to screen \nand structure investments. The fund will carry out fundamental research and due diligence on \neach portfolio company in order to understand its objectives, management philosophies, and the \npersonalities involved. The fund manager will seek to help its investee companies monitor \nmarket trends and product technology, not only through its own resources but also with the \nassistance of entrepreneurs, consultants, and industry experts. The fund will (i) seek to invest in \nSMEs  that  are  financially  sound,  with  solid  operating  performance,  profitability,  and  asset \nquality;  (ii) have  committed  senior  management  teams;  (iii)  have  an  attractive growth  and \ncompetitive position; and (iv) have a clear path to exit. The fund's portfolio companies must be \nwell positioned to take advantage of interregional trade. The fund manager will also require the \nfund's portfolio companies to fully comply with national and international anti-money-laundering \nand  know-your-client  requirements.  These  policies  represent  additional  mechanisms  of \nmitigating risk beyond the investment process.  \n \n \nC.  Business Overview and Strategy \n24.  Overview.  The  fund  will  invest  in  privately  negotiated  equity  and  equity-related \ninvestments in growth-oriented SMEs operating in the PRC and the ASEAN region. The fund \nwill  actively  target  growth-oriented  medium-sized  companies  seeking  capital  to  finance \nexpansion, acquisitions, joint ventures, or corporate restructuring. The fund will focus on sectors \nthat are well positioned in terms of competitiveness and growth prospects and on investments \nlikely to benefit from increased intra- and interregional trade. \n \n25.  Strategy. The fund will make investments of $5 million\u2013$20 million per company, and \nwill tend to take a minority equity stake (i.e., less than 50% in portfolio companies), which it will \nhold for an average of 3\u20135 years. The fund investments will generally take the form of ordinary \nor preference shares, convertible or exchangeable bonds, or debt with warrants. The fund will \nhave board of directors representation and/or observer status, and veto power over major \naspects of the portfolio company's business via a comprehensive shareholder agreement.  \n \n26.  The targeted allocation for the fund is 50% in the ASEAN region and 50% in the PRC. \nThe  targeted  suballocation  for  the  ASEAN  region  is  5%\u201310%  for  Cambodia  and  the  Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), 25% for Viet Nam, 15%\u201320% for Thailand, 20%\u201330% \nfor  Indonesia,  15%\u201320%  for  the  Philippines,  and  10%  for  Singapore. 10  The  targeted \nsuballocation in the PRC is 20%\u201335% for the western region (Gansu, Guangxi, Guizhou, Inner \n                                                 \n10 All investments in Singapore will primarily be \u201cflow through\u201d investments (i.e., investments booked in Singapore for \nwhich the ultimate beneficiary country is elsewhere in the region, either in ASEAN or the PRC).   \n ", "  7\nMongolia, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Xizang Autonomous Region,11 and Xinjiang, \nYunan,), 10%\u201320% for the central region (Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Shanxi), \n5%\u201315% for the northeastern region (Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning,) and 40%\u201350% for the \neast coast region. \n \n27.  The fund will not invest in any single portfolio company that is more than 15% of the \nfund's aggregate capital commitments. The focus industry sectors for this fund will be similar to \nACIF  I,  which  are  energy,  consumer  services,  consumer  goods,  industrials,  health  care, \nmaterials, environment, and technology.  \n \n28.  Management. The fund's management team consists of individuals with experience in \nbanking and investments in financial institutions. Core team members are as follows:  \n \n(i)  Board of directors of the fund manager \n(a) Kie Cheong Chong, chair and director; \n(b) Kian-Wee Seah, director, and chair of investment committee; \n(c) David Goss, director; \n(d) Michael Landau, director; and \n(e) Robert A. Berliner, director. \n \n(ii)  Senior members of United Overseas Bank Venture Management \n(a) Kian-Wee Seah, manager director; \n(b) Mark Yeo Wee Tiong, executive director; \n(c) Aw Chye Huat, executive director; \n(d) Paul Ng, director; \n(e) Jean Thoh, director; and  \n(f)  Maggie Lin, director. \n \n29.  Appendix 4 provides biographical information on the key personnel of UOBVM. \n \n30.  Deal sourcing. The fund manager will identify investment opportunities for the fund from \nthe following sources:  \n \n(i)  UOB. UOB has an extensive presence and network in the region with over 500 \noffices and branches in 7 cities in the PRC. Its core strengths in SME lending and \nits far-reaching market knowledge of Asia will be an important deal source for the \nfund.  \n(ii)  Relationship driven. The management team has built up an extensive network \nof personal and business relationships over a long period of time, with most of \nthe management team having lived and worked in Asia for a number of years.  \n(iii)  Sector driven. UOBVM has over the years invested in a number of industry \nsectors identified for this fund which it will seek to capitalize on to originate high-\nquality deals.  \n(iv)  Co-investment  opportunities.  The  fund  manager  enjoys  excellent  working \nrelationships with many leading Asian private equity fund managers and is often \ninvited to co-invest in transactions.   \n \n                                                 \n11 Also known as Tibet Autonomous Region. \n ", "8 \n31.  Value  addition.  The fund manager will provide portfolio companies with access to \nmanagement know-how, new markets, and new technology in addition to financing. Consistent \nwith this approach, the manager will endeavor through its bank parent and/or other related \ncorporations  to  help  portfolio  companies  obtain  new  funding  facilities,  prepare  portfolio \ncompanies for public listing, recruit a qualified financial controller, perform environment and \nsocial safeguards risk mitigation, improve corporate governance, and introduce the portfolio \ncompanies to analysts and institutional investors during the initial public offering (IPO). Value \naddition will also take the form of instituting consistent financial reporting, portfolio management, \nasset  quality,  nonperforming  loan  resolution,  budgeting,  and  planning  across  investee \ninstitutions.  \n \n32.  Exit. The fund aims to exit investments over an average period of 3\u20135 years. UOBVM's \nexperience  in  Asian  private  equity  since  1992  has  demonstrated  its  expertise  in  exiting \ninvestments via a variety of routes, including (i) an IPO on one of the region\u2019s stock exchanges, \n(ii) an IPO on a stock exchange outside the region (e.g., the NASDAQ12), (iii) a trade sale, \n(iv) exercise of contractual put obligations negotiated at the time of investment, and (v) share \nswaps for listed shares and/or other tradable assets. UOBVM has achieved approximately 45 \nexits utilizing all of the above routes since 1992 and will employ the same means to exit the fund \nportfolio company investments.  \n \nD.  Investment Cost and Financing Plan \n33.  The fund manager completed the first closing of $46 million in December 2009. The first \nclose included the following investors: UOB ($30 million), Proparco ($10 million), Infrastructure \nDevelopment Finance Company ($5 million, will consider up to $15 million by final close), and \nthe fund manager employees ($1million). The CDB has signed a letter of intent to invest up to \n$50 million in this fund, and this is subject to the establishment of the China Development Bank \nCapital Corporation (CDB's asset management arm) and its investment decision procedures. \nADB is considering a $25 million commitment for the second close in the second quarter 2010. \nFor the third close prior to the end of 2010, the fund will target other international financial \ninstitutions,  fund  of  funds,  and  other  commercial  investors.  The  fund  expects  to  target  a \ncapitalization by final closing of approximately $200 million\u2013$250 million.  \n \nE.  Financial Performance \n34.  Since commencing operations in 2004, ACIF I has invested in 15 portfolio companies, 6 \nof which it has fully exited. Of the 15 portfolio companies, 7 have achieved a public stock \nexchange listing. For some of the portfolio companies, the ACIF I management team was able \nto call on other UOB entities to provide assistance with underwriting or other aspects of the \npublic listing and/or IPO process (Appendix 5 provides the ACIF I investment track record). As \nof 30 September 2009, the total cost of investments for ACIF I was $55.1 million, and the total \nrealized value was $98.3 million. As of 30 September 2009, the money multiple for ACIF I was \n2.38 (including unrealized investments), and the money multiple for realized investments was \n3.26. As of 30 June 2009, the net internal rate of return for ACIF I was 42.07%.  \n \n                                                 \n12 The NASDAQ is the American stock exchange. ", "  9\nF.  Financial Objectives \n35.  The  fund\u2019s  objective  is  to  acquire  ordinary  or  preference  shares,  convertible  or \nexchangeable  bonds,  or  debt  with  warrants  in  portfolio  companies  with  established  track \nrecords. Through these investments, the fund is targeting a net internal rate of return of 20%. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  ADB Intervention and Transaction Structure \n36.  ADB proposes to make an equity investment of up to $25 million in the fund, not to \nexceed 25% of the fund's total commitments, whichever is less, and not resulting in ADB being \nthe largest investor in the fund. ADB's equity contribution to the fund will be used exclusively for \ninvestments in ADB's DMCs. The fund will have an 8-year life with an option to extend fund life \nby two 1-year extensions subject to approval of the advisory board. The management fee for the \nfund will be 2.25% of the committed capital (in the event the committed capital for the fund \nexceeds $120 million by the final close, the management fee will be reduced to 2.00% of \ncommitted capital for the fund) during the commitment period and will be equal to 2.00% of \ninvestment amounts thereafter. After returning all the investment amounts and an 8% per \nannum preferred return to fund investors, the fund manager will receive 25% of the preferred \nreturn. In addition, the fund manager will be entitled to a carried interest of 20% subject to \nachievement of 8% preferred return. \n \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n37.  ADB's investment in the fund is justified due to the following value-addition aspects:  \n \n(i)  A catalytic role in raising funds. Despite the excellent performance with its \nprevious fund, the manager is finding it difficult to raise the needed capital for this \nfund due to the currently challenging fund raising environment. The Emerging \nMarket Private Equity Association (a nonprofit independent association based in \nWashington, DC) reports a decline in private equity fund raising of over 50% \nyear-on-year in emerging markets.13 ADB involvement will send a strong signal to \nthe market and enable the fund to reach its target level of capitalization and \nsustain its funding to SMEs to facilitate regional trade. \n \n(ii)  Advisory needs on sustainable development measures crucial to enriching \nthe  governance  of  the  fund.  ADB's  new  sets  of  environment  and  social \nsafeguard policies and procedures14 could guide the fund in screening future \ninvestee companies. ADB, through its participation, will support and enhance the \nactivities of the fund manager and help integrate the best practices with regard to \nenvironmental and social standards and corporate governance in the investee \nSMEs in the DMCs. \n \n(iii)  ADB's  understanding  of  the  market  and  its  relationship  with  ASEAN \nmember states. ADB will make available its services to help identify and assess \ntarget  investees  for  the  fund  and  help  demonstrate  through  this  fund  the \n                                                 \n13 A total of 84 emerging market funds raised $16 billion through January\u2013June 2009, compared to 132 funds raising \n$36 billion in the same period in 2008. \n14 ADB. 2009. Safeguard Policy Statement. Manila. \n ", "10 \npossibility of sustaining a model for financial intermediaries serving SMEs in \nDMCs. \n \n38.  UOB, the fund sponsor and a highly reputable Asian financial institution that is based in \nthe ASEAN region, values ADB's input and guidance in this initiative highly and looks forward to \ncollaborating with ADB. Along with ADB, the manager intends to invite a senior representative of \nthe ASEAN secretariat to join the advisory board.  \n \nC.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n39.   The main risks of the investment and their principal mitigants are outlined below: \n \n(i)  Investment strategy. The investment environment has changed markedly from \nthe time of the predecessor fund and the use of the same investment strategy for \nthis follow-on fund may be unsuitable. In response, the fund manager has made \nseveral important changes to its investment strategy, specifically as regard to the \ngeographic focus. The first fund invested heavily in the PRC and in a limited \nnumber of ASEAN countries. The second fund will target a wider basket of \nASEAN countries including the Mekong Subregion and the Philippines. It will also \nbroaden  its  coverage  of  the  PRC  to  include  the  relatively  underdeveloped \nwestern, central and northeastern regions. This change of focus should improve \nthe investment prospects of the fund.  \n \n(ii)  Competition for investments and deal pipeline risk. There is a risk that the \nsuccess of the predecessor fund could lead to greater competition from other \nfund  managers  following  similar  strategies  and  targeting  the  same  types  of \ninvestments as this fund. Competition for investments may result in overvaluation \nof target investee companies and the loss of investment opportunities available to \nthe fund. Companies listed in the pipeline of prospective investees may turn out \nto be unsuitable for reasons previously unidentified. This risk is partially mitigated \nby the abundant need for equity investment in the economies within the target \nregion and by the fund manager's deep relationships in the market, which should \nfacilitate the sourcing and development of pipeline opportunities going forward.   \n \n(iii)  Insufficient management resources. Since the fund manager oversees other \nprivate  equity  funds  affiliated  with  the  sponsor,  the  availability  of  sufficient \nmanagement  oversight  on  the  fund's  investment  activities  is  an  important \nconsideration. This risk is mitigated by the pre-determined time commitment from \neach of the fund manager's key business executives. Furthermore, the advisory \nagreement and the partnership agreement designate key business executives for \nthe  investment  adviser  and  general  partners  whose  continued  presence  is \nrequired  for  the  fund's  operation.  Their  absence  would  result  in  temporary \nsuspension  of  the  fund's  investment  activities  until  it  is  remedied  by  the \nappointment of qualified replacements and lifting of suspension by the limited \npartners.   \n \n(iv)  Potential conflicts of interest. The fund manager oversees other private equity \nfunds affiliated with the sponsor. There is, therefore, potential conflict of interest \nfrom competition among affiliated funds for the same investment opportunities.  \nThis risk is modest as the timing for this fund differs from other sister funds, \nwhich are presently in exit phase, thereby preventing competition between funds ", "  11\nfor  similar  investment  opportunities.  The  risk  of  this  fund  serving  as  an  exit \nmechanism for other affiliated funds is also minimal as this fund is prohibited from \ninvesting in companies owned by affiliates without prior approval of the advisory \nboard,  whose  members  consist  of  representatives  from  the  limited  partners.  \nConflict of interest during investment phase is further controlled by the presence \nof one independent investment committee member who has veto power over \ndecisions of the committee and whose selection is subject to ADB's right of \"no \nobjection\". Finally, all banking and finance or advisory services will be awarded \non an arm's length basis to ensure no exclusivity with UOB.   \n \n(v)  Exit risks. The fund may experience difficulty exiting from investments within the \nplanned divestment period. Valuations in the equities market may be too low for \nthe fund to list its investment companies or to profitably exercise its conversion \noption after listing. This risk is partially mitigated by the fund manager obtaining \nput options at the time of purchase, where possible, and also by the policy of the \nfund manager to identify and arrange exit mechanisms at the time of investment. \nThe fund manager's track record of successful exits in the predecessor fund \nshould also mitigate this risk to some extent.  \n \n(vi)  Currency risks. As the fund will be capitalized in US dollars and as specific \ninvestments  are  funded  in  the  local  currency,  the  fund  may  be  exposed  to \ncurrency depreciation in the countries of investment. This risk can be minimized \nthrough diversification of investments across the different countries of ASEAN.   \n \n(vii)  Geopolitical, macroeconomic and social risks. The fund's investments will be \nin developing countries that are exposed to political, economic and social risks. \nThese  risks  may  impact  the  returns  and  stability  of  the  fund\u2019s  investments. \nHowever,  a  diversified  portfolio  approach  is  expected  to  mitigate  particular \nscenario risk from any one country. Furthermore, ADB\u2019s bilateral linkages and \nclose relationship with the governments in the region, which are seen to be \nsupportive of prioritizing private sector development and other poverty reduction \nmeasures, may help mitigate these risks.   \n \n(viii)  Accounting  and  disclosure  standards.  Accounting,  financial  and  other \nreporting  standards  in  many  developing  countries  in  Southeast  Asia  are  not \nequivalent to those in the United States and certain Western European countries.  \nAccordingly, less information may be available to investors. These risks may be \nmitigated  by  requiring  that  the  fund  employ  international  financial  reporting \nstandards and international standards on audit in the reports it submits to ADB, \nand through legal documentation that takes into consideration and mitigates the \naforementioned risks as appropriate. \n \n(ix)  Legal risk and regulatory risk.  Different DMC governments impose varying \nlegal requirements for investment entities like private equity funds. Because of \nundeveloped  or  underdeveloped  regulatory  frameworks  in  most  developing \nSoutheast Asian countries, many laws and regulations are being changed or \namended from time to time, which to varying degrees can negatively affect future \ninvestments of the fund. This risk is mitigated by a careful assessment of the \nlegal environment by the fund manager and by legal documentation for fund \ninvestments that takes such risks into consideration. The fund manager, as part \n ", "12 \nof its due diligence for fund investments, will retain external counsel to conduct \nlegal due diligence.   \n \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Environment and Social Safeguards   \n40.  The fund will comply with the 2009 ADB Safeguard Policy Statement.15 A recent review \nof the environmental and social management system of ACIF I found it to be compliant with \nADB policies in effect at that time. The fund manager will enhance the environmental and social \nmanagement system prepared by ACIF I such that it complies with the 2009 ADB Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. This will form the basis of the environmental and social management system \nto be adopted by the fund (Appendix 6 is a summary of the expected environmental, health, \nsafety, labor, and governance review guidelines for this fund). In accordance with the Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement,  the  fund  will  undertake  to  comply  with  applicable  national  laws  and \nregulations and will apply the prohibited investment activities list in respect of subprojects \nfinanced  by  ADB's  investment.  With  no  significant  environmental  impact  expected,  ADB's \ninvestment in the fund is assigned FI with respect to environment. With respect to involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous people, ADB's investment in the fund is expected to have no \nimpact and is therefore classified category C. The fund will screen future investments and \nexclude any investments causing involuntary land or right-of-way acquisition or adverse impacts \non indigenous people.  \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n41.  In keeping with implementation arrangements for the majority of ADB's private equity \nfund investments, monitoring of this investment will be the responsibility of private equity funds \nstaff in the Capital Markets and Financial Sectors Division. The fund will provide all investors \nwith quarterly unaudited financial reports, an annual financial audited report, and an annual \nenvironmental and social performance report. ADB will review these reports on an ongoing \nbasis, alongside information on the portfolio's valuation and performance of individual investees. \nADB will also be entitled to representation on the advisory board (i.e., the fund's governance \nbody, separate from the board of directors), and via that representation will be involved in \ndiscussions and decisions related to corporate governance, portfolio valuations, and conflicts of \ninterest.  \n \nC.  Anticorruption Policy  \n42.  The fund was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and \npolicy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire  the  fund  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls \nfollowing international best-practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The investment documentation between ADB and the fund will \nfurther allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2009. Safeguard Policy Statement. Manila. ", "  13\n43.  The fund manager is a limited liability company established under the laws of the State \nof Delaware in the United States for the purpose of managing the fund. The fund is incorporated \nin the Cayman Islands, a commonly used offshore financial center. Incorporation in an offshore \nfinancial center allows the fund and its investors to avoid excessive taxation, as a result of the \nCaymans\u2019 own tax regulations and the tax treaties that it has with other countries. Cayman \nIslands appear on the list of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) \npublished jurisdictions that are committed to improving transparency and establishing effective \nexchange of information in tax matters.  \n \n44.  Having undertaken its own due diligence of this matter, ADB is reasonably satisfied that \nthe fund will not be used for cross-border tax evasion, money laundering, or the financing of \nterrorism. \n \nD.  Investment Limitations \n45.  The proposed investment will be within the midterm, country, industry, group, and single \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nE.  Assurances \n46.  Following the approval of the proposed investment by ADB's Board of Directors, ADB \nwill enter into suitable documentation, in a form and substance satisfactory to ADB. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n47.

Introduction \n \n1.   The ASEAN China Investment Fund II (ACIF II) will invest in privately negotiated equity \nand equity-related investments in growth-oriented small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) \noperating in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) region. ACIF II will actively target growth-oriented medium-sized companies \nseeking capital to finance expansion, acquisitions, joint ventures, or corporate restructuring. It \nwill invest in existing SMEs with existing facilities or operations in ASEAN member countries. In \nthe PRC, ACIF II intends to invest in SMEs in the western region (Gansu, Guangxi, Guizhou, \nInner Mongolia, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Xizang Autonomous Region,1 and Xinjiang, \nYunnan,) central region (Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Shanxi), the northeastern \nregion (Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning) and the east coast region. \n \nB.  Environmental and Social Policy and Applicable Requirements \n \n1.  Policy \n \n2.   Environmental  and  Social  Policy  Statement  of  ACIF  II  was  signed  by \n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026,  president  (or  indicate  other  position  or  designation)  on \n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. and states that: \n \n3.   ACIF II will ensure and enhance effective environmental and social practices in all its \nactivities, products, and services, with a special focus on the following: \n \n(i)  Ensuring that environmental and social safeguards as defined by the applicable \nnational  government  environmental  laws  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) are met. \n(ii)  Ensuring,  where  required,  that  project  environmental  and  social  risks  are \nmitigated, and that international best practices are integrated by the investee \nproject  proponent  into  the  project  design  prior  to  its  financing,  and  in  its \nimplementation during the operational phase. \n(iii)  Integrating environmental risk into its internal risk management analysis. \n(iv)  Working together with the investee company management to put into practice \napplicable and environmental and social safeguard requirements. \n(v)  Ensuring  appropriate  consultation  in  its  investee  project  activities  and \ntransparency in environmental, social, health and safety, labor, and governance \n(ESHSLG) activities. \n(vi)  Promoting projects with environmental and social benefits. \n \n4.   This policy will be communicated to all staff and operational employees of the ACIF II. \n \n \nSigned               Effective Date \n \n__________________________        _____________________ \n                                                 \n1  Also known as Tibet Autonomous Region. ", "  Appendix 6  23 \n2.  Applicable Requirements \n \n5.   ACIF II will ensure that  \n \n(i)  investee  projects  using  ADB  funds  are  screened  against  ADB's  Prohibited \nInvestment Activities List; \n(ii)  all investee projects using ADB funds with potential environmental impacts are \nreviewed  against  the  safeguards  requirements  of  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009);2 and \n(iii)  all investee projects are reviewed and evaluated against applicable national laws, \nregulations, and standards on environment, health and safety, and social issues. \n \nC.  Environmental and Social Management Procedures \n \n1.  Investment Screening \n \n6.   Initial screening. The fund manager will screen the proposed investment against ADB's \nProhibited Investment Activities List. \n \n7.   Second screening. The fund manager will determine whether an investment could have \nadverse environmental impact (and is therefore classified as a category A or B project using \nscreening  checklist  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  and  will  follow  ADB's  environmental \nassessment  preparation,  disclosure,  and  review  requirements.  With  respect  to  involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples impacts, the fund manager will conduct an initial review \nusing the attached checklist (Supplementary Appendix B) to ensure that the investment will not \nhave adverse impacts on indigenous people or impinge on the lands owned, or claimed under \nadjudication, by indigenous people or entail any involuntary resettlement impacts.  \n \n8.   For  environment  category  A  investments,  the  fund  manager  will  require  investee \ncompanies to prepare an environmental impact assessment report. The draft assessment report \nwill be submitted by the fund manager to ADB for review and disclosure on ADB\u2019s website 120-\ndays before approval of the project by the fund manager. \n \n9.   The fund manager will conduct an on-site inspection and review of any preliminary \nenvironmental, social, health and safety, and labor applicable documentation. Detailed EHSLG \ndocument request list given to the company.  \n  \n10.   Third screening. As a core component of ACIF due diligence (and as a prerequisite to \neach ACIF investment approval), independent outside EHSLG experts are fielded to assess \nhow prospective investee companies are performing in respect of ESHLG benchmarks. The \nprogram benchmarks local laws against ADB, World Bank, and International Labor Organization \nstandards. There will be independent review to ensure that the investment does not have \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts and adverse impacts on indigenous peoples. \n  \n11.   ACIF I and II have carried out 19 investee company assessments in five countries. \nThese assessments have covered a diverse range of industries, including instant noodles, clean \ntechnology, and fertilizer production. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2009. Safeguard Policy Statement. Manila.  \n ", "24   Appendix 6 \n \n2.  Benchmarking and Road Map    \n \n12.   Investee company screening provides a detailed, user-friendly road map that identifies \nfor ACIF management and the investee company the following:  \n \n(i)  issues or potential issues related to compliance and the relevant laws and/or \nregulations, \n(ii)  remedial actions to achieve compliance and/or better practice recommendations, \nand  \n(iii)  a time frame and estimated cost to achieve compliance.  \n \n13.   This benchmarking and road map process provides companies with greater awareness \nof the laws and regulations and the consequences of their acts or inaction.  \n \n14.   This process is essential, particularly for investments involving operational and partly \ncompleted facilities. For these types of investments, the fund manager will also conduct an \nindependent audit of environment and social performance of the investee company and identify \ncorrective actions if necessary.3 If the investment involves an upgrade or expansion of existing \nfacilities that has potential adverse impacts on the environment, the requirements for category A \nand B projects will also apply in addition to the environmental and social compliance audit. If it \nentails unavoidable adverse impacts on indigenous peoples, or land acquisition or involuntary \nresettlement impacts, such investment will be excluded for financing. \n \n3.  Environmental, Health and Safety and Risk Management   \n \n15.   EHSLG screening and monitoring is an integral part of the ACIF risk management \nprogram. In this regard, the EHSLG provides a mechanism to assist the ACIF general partner to \ninvest the funds entrusted to it in a prudent and responsible manner and achieve enhanced \nreturns,  while  guarding  against  potential  financial  and  reputation  losses  for  the  fund,  its \nmanagement, and investors.  \n \n16.   After the in-depth environment and social due diligence appraisal by the investment \nteam, and upon a positive recommendation made by relevant team members, the proposal will \nbe reviewed by the management committee of the manager, before being presented to the \ninvestment committee for final approval. The investment team will inform management of any \nenvironmental and social risks with the investment and the mitigating measures or plans agreed \nwith the investee company.  \n \n17.   Once approved by the investment committee, a proposed investment may be subject to \nadditional due diligence, as well as additional reference and business checks. At this point, a \nrecommendation is made to the general partner\u2019s board of directors for a final decision, subject \nto completion of all necessary legal documentation. Safeguard risk mitigation plans, corrective \naction plans, and other measures, as well as requirements to submit environmental and social \nmonitoring reports, will be included in the legal agreements with the investee company. \n                                                 \n3  The contents of a typical environmental and social audit include (i) executive summary; (ii) facilities description, \nincluding past and current activities; (iii) summary of national, local, and any applicable environmental and social \nlaws (including labor) and regulations; (iv) audit and site investigation scope and procedures (including a review of \npresence  of  outstanding  liabilities,  and  administrative  and  court  cases  arising  from  noncompliance  with \nenvironmental and social requirements, outstanding compensation issues, among others); (v) findings and areas of \nconcern; and (vi) a corrective action plan, providing for appropriate corrective actions or measures to address any \narea of noncompliance, including costs and schedule.   \n    ", "  Appendix 6  25 \n \n4.  Transforming Investees   \n \n18.   By working closely with investee company management on EHSLG issues, ACIF helps \ntransform investees, many of which commence operating as small, family-owned enterprises,4 \ninto well-managed, responsible companies that operate under, and are governed by, applicable \ngovernment laws and regulations and internationally recognized standards on environment, \nhealth  and  safety,  and  labor.5 This  process  assists  investee  companies  to  compete  more \neffectively in regional and/or international markets.  \n \n19.   The transformational role of ACIF has proven particularly important for companies based \nin the PRC, and represents a key responsible investment impact of ACIF. \n \n20.   While the PRC has in place excellent environmental and labor laws and regulations, \nrapid growth has put constraints on human resources in these sectors, at times resulting in \nenforcement issues and lack of knowledge on how to comply with the law. By way of example, \nan ESHLG review of an ACIF investee found that a chemical company had required safety \nequipment but lacked knowledge on how to set up appropriate systems, train its personnel in \nsafety procedures, and where to obtain experienced trainers. ACIF was instrumental in assisting \nthe company to identify and engage the needed personnel to upgrade its safety capabilities. \n \n5.  Good Governance   \n \n21.   Pre-initial public offering. Ensure that investee companies adopt and adhere to the \nfollowing appropriate corporate governance standards,6 including at the pre-initial public offering \n(IPO) stage: \n \n(i)  bringing investee accounting standards up to generally accepted international \npractices; \n(ii)  appointing independent outside directors;  \n(iii)  appointing a recognized audit firm; \n(iv)  appointing a qualified financial controller;  \n(v)  adopting conflict of interest procedures, including disclosure to management of \nall related-party transactions; and \n(vi)  using management information and/or financial control systems and decision \nmaking processes.  \n \n22.   Post-initial public offering. The annual report of each listed company in Singapore will \ndescribe the company\u2019s corporate governance policies and practices with specific reference \nmade to each of the principles of the Code of Corporate Governance 2005.  \n \n23.   Singapore is recognized as having a strong corporate governance code and companies \ncan expect to be publicly asked questions, in writing, by the Singapore Exchange. \n \n                                                 \n4  Many of which have management, accounting, audit, and production and/or product standards that can be \nsignificantly improved. \n5  Virtually all ACIF investee companies have, or are seeking to achieve, globally recognized certifications in their \nrespective business sectors (such as (ISO), SA 8000, OHSAS 18000 and HACCP as applicable). ACIF will also \nencourage investee companies to comply with IFC's Performance Standard 2 on Labor and Working Conditions \n(Available  http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/sustainability.nsf/Content/PerformanceStandards).  (ISO  =  International \nOrganization for Standardization; SA 8000 is a global social accountability standard for decent working conditions, \ndeveloped  and  overseen  by  Social  Accountability  International  (SAI);  OHSAS  18000  is  an  international \noccupational health and safety management system specification; and HACCP = Hazard Analysis & Critical \nControl Points) \n6  Based primarily on the Best Practices Guide issued by the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (SGX-\nST) and the Code of Corporate Governance. \n ", "26   Appendix 6 \n24.   All listed companies tend to have major institutional investors as shareholders and the \ninfluence of such institutions on the outside directors, management, and the company generally \nto ensure compliance with laws, regulations, and financial and corporate governance standards \ncan be significant. Engagement with management by major shareholders on EHSLG issues is \nbecoming common in Europe and North America, and this trend will be more evident in Asia in \nthe  future.  Increasingly,  regional  stock  exchanges  are  adopting,  or  are  in  the  process  of \nreviewing, guidelines on Environmental and Social listing and reporting requirements. \n \n6.  Advisory Support   \n \n25.   In addition to EHSLG-related activities, ACIF provides investee companies with financial \nand business advisory support, including  \n \n(i)  introducing new funding techniques and sources of funding (usually international \nfinancial groups) with the aim of reducing funding costs;  \n(ii)  arranging, advising, and assisting investee companies with road shows to major \ninternational financial centers; and \n(iii)  pre-IPO assistance whereby the ACIF deal team spends considerable time with \nmanagement of investee companies in what is best described as an ongoing \ntraining exercise, so that the management understands the importance of good \ncorporate governance and what is required to manage a listed company. \n \n7.  Monitoring and Reporting \n \n26.   Once an investment is made, close monitoring by the investment advisor becomes an \nessential aspect of the investment process. In almost all instances, the investment advisor is \nrepresented on the board of the portfolio company. The monitoring is further enhanced through \nperiodic visits and frequent communication with the management of the investee companies. \nThis  enables  the  fund\u2019s  management  team  to  keep  abreast  of  opportunities  facing  each \ninvestee company.  \n \n27.   After a category A or B project is approved, the fund manager will communicate with the \ninvestee company and confirm from time to time that it is meeting compliance obligations of all \napplicable environmental and social safeguard requirements, and ACIF will report to ADB any \nactual or potential breach of the compliance requirements promptly after becoming aware of it. \n \n28.   Environmental and social performance will be evaluated annually. The benchmark for \nperformance will be the ongoing compliance against the applicable environmental and social \nsafeguard requirements. ACIF will ensure that the investee company prepares and submits an \nannual  environmental  monitoring  report  (Supplementary  Appendix  C)  and  will  review  and \nassess the investee project's performance on environmental and social safeguards issues.  \n \n29.   Based on the review of the annual monitoring reports from the investee projects, the \nenvironmental and social safeguard manager will prepare an annual environmental and social \nperformance report substantially in the form set out in Supplementary Appendix D and submit it \nto ADB. The fund manager will also report on the social safeguards screening process and \ninclude in the information on whether any investments requiring involuntary resettlement and \nindigenous peoples impacts were excluded from financing. \n ", "  Appendix 6  27 \n \n \n \nD.  Organization and Responsibilities, Resources, and Capacity \n \n30.   Organization and responsibilities. The fund manager will appoint an environmental \nand  social  safeguard  manager  (or  other  designated  officer)  who  reports  to  the  ACIF \nmanagement  team.  The  environment  and  social  safeguard  manager  has  oversight  for \nenvironmental and social issues, ensures the resources are made available for environmental \nand  social  management,  and  signs  and  submits  the  annual  environmental  and  social \nperformance report to ADB. She or he will ensure that ADB and other cofinanciers are notified if \nthe current staffing organization changes or when staff are replaced.  \n \n31.   Resources and capacity. The environmental and social safeguard manager (or other \ndesignated officer) should work with the ACIF management team to ensure that adequate \nresources have been committed to allow for the effective implementation of the environmental \nand social management system policy and procedures. She or he will need to be technically \nqualified and should work with relevant environment and social framework in carrying out the \nscreening and due diligence or review work. She or he should attend environmental and social \ntraining related to compliance and monitoring activities (e.g., ADB or International Finance \nCorporation-sponsored training, International Organization for Standardization training). ACIF \nwill maintain a pool of qualified environmental and social consultants who can be called upon to \nassist in conducting environmental and social reviews as appropriate. \n ", "28   Appendix 7 \n \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nProject Title: ASEAN China Investment Fund II \nLending/Financing  Equity Investment  Department/  Private Sector Operations Department / \nModality:  Division:  Capital Markets and Financial Sectors Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n \nThe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB's) investment in the ASEAN China Investment Fund II (ACIF II) is ultimately \nintended, over the long term, to help increase regional trade, economic growth, and private sector development in \nAsia. It is expected to contribute to the regional trade and investment within the countries of the Association of South \nEast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region, and between ASEAN and the People's Republic of China (PRC), and promote \nprivate equity participation in the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector to facilitate balanced and \nsustainable economic development in ADB's developing member countries (DMCs). The project is consistent with \nStrategy  2020,  which  identifies  private  sector  development  as  a  key  driver  of  change,  and  finance  sector \ndevelopment as one of five core specializations that support ADB\u2019s agenda.a It is also consistent with the three \nstrategic priorities of Strategy 2020: (i) inclusive economic growth, by providing much-needed growth capital for \nSMEs in ASEAN and the PRC; (ii) environmentally sustainable development, by screening and monitoring all \ninvestee companies for compliance with ADB, World Bank, and International Labor Organization environmental and \nsocial guidelines, and for compliance with best practices in respect of corporate governance; and (iii) regional \nintegration, by contributing to the expansion of regional trade and investment between the ASEAN member states \nand the PRC, and their respective overseas trading partners. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  General intervention         \n \n1. Key issues. The project is expected to increase intra- and interregional trade and indirectly contribute to poverty \nreduction by creating jobs and sustainable employment in the PRC and ASEAN member countries as well as \npotentially lowering costs of various consumer products produced by target investee companies.    \n2. Design features. The fund will invest in privately negotiated equity and equity-related investments in growth-\noriented SMEs operating in the PRC and the ASEAN region. The fund will actively target growth-oriented medium-\nsized companies seeking capital to finance expansion, acquisitions, joint ventures, or corporate restructuring. \nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nNot applicable. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey issues. ACIF II will invest in existing SMEs with existing facilities or operations. In the PRC, the fund intends to \ninvest in SMEs in the western region (Gansu, Guangxi, Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, \nSichuan, Xizang Autonomous Region1, and Xinjiang, Yunnan), central region (Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, \nand Shanxi), the northeastern region (Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning,), and the east coast region. While there are \nethnic minorities in some of these regions, existing SMEs to be financed by the fund are typically located in \ndeveloped commercial and industrial zones. On the basis of the nature of the target investment subsectors and the \nlocation of the potential investments, the project has been classified C under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement on \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. United Overseas Bank Venture Management (UOBVM), the fund \nmanager, has adopted an environment and social reporting and corporate governance standard that includes \nprinciples, policies, and procedures for screening potential environmental and social issues related to involuntary \nresettlement, indigenous peoples, health and safety, and labor prior to making an investment. Each investment will \nbe reviewed for such impacts and, in the unlikely event that a potential adverse social impact is identified, the fund \nmanager will require investee companies to prepare the necessary plans or remedial actions with a time frame and \nestimated cost to achieve compliance.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Also known as Tibet Autonomous Region.

Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nConsultations were conducted with the fund manager in designing this transaction.  \n2. What level of consultation and participation is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3. Was a consultation and participation plan prepared?   Yes      No    \n \nFor  investments  that  have  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts,  the  fund  manager  requires  investee \ncompanies to undertake consultation and participation activities in accordance with ADB safeguard policy and public \ncommunications policy requirements.  \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1. Key issues. The initial list of potential investee companies includes companies involved in manufacturing \n(pharmaceutical, chemical, latex gloves, and fertilizer), media animation, health care facility management, and food \nprocessing (cocoa, bamboo shoots, tea and herbal extracts, etc.).
