The Green and Resilient Affordable Housing Sector Project (the project) is proposed to be \nfinanced by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The project, which will be implemented during \n2021\u20132027, aims to support the Government of Bhutan\u2019s efforts to implement the National \nHousing Policy, 2020 (NHP).1 The objectives of the NHP include (i) providing safe, affordable, \nand adequate rental housing for all; (ii) promoting home ownership; (iii) encouraging partnership \nand cooperation among private and government entities; and (iv) promoting green and energy-\nefficient housing. To support the project, ADB will provide a concessional loan of $24 million from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, and a grant of $6 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \n(Asian  Development  Fund). 2  The  executing  agency  is  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  the \nimplementing agency is the National Housing Development Corporation Limited (NHDCL). The \nproject will be aligned with the following impact: livability, safety, and sustainability of human \nsettlements ensured.3 \n \n2.  The housing supply is unable to meet the increased demand for serviced land and housing, \nand house prices and rents are rising\u2014making housing unaffordable for low-income households. \nLow-income civil servants who earn Nu900 to Nu3,500 per month face rental stress as they spend \nmore than 40% of their income on housing.4 The government, with the financial support of ADB \nand through the NHDCL, will provide about 1,000 serviced rental units to civil servants and non-\ncivil servants, including marginalized municipal waste workers, with an affordable pricing objective \nto ensure that expenditures on housing do not exceed 30%. Further, the Asian Development Fund \ngrant will support the promotion of the Sustainable Development Goal 5 transformative gender \nagenda by pilot-testing integrated service centers and livelihood initiatives to address gender \nissues. The project will cover nine locations across six districts\u2014Nganglam (1 subproject), \nPhuentsholing (3 subprojects), Samdrup Jongkhar (2 subprojects), Thimphu (1 subproject), \nTrashiyangtse (1 subproject), and Samtse (1 subproject) with the potential for replication in \nadditional subprojects to be funded under the sector loan or in a subsequent phase. The project \nis expected to benefit 1,000 households directly, by putting families, including vulnerable groups \nsuch as women and youth, into rental homes. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  The government has requested ADB support to help implement the project. To support \nthe project implementation, the transaction technical assistance (TA) will assist, to effectively \nimplement the project. The TA objectives are to (i) strengthen the NHP and review land availability, \nland management, and land-use planning; (ii) mainstream resilience considerations in the housing \ndevelopment process, and promote the use of innovative construction technology and practices; \n(iii) establish a housing MIS; and (iv) provide technical support to the NHDCL on the project\u2019s  \nsafeguard compliance. Specifically, the TA will provide technical advisory support services to the \nNHDCL (i) to review and update its allotment rules and regulations to ensure consistency with the \nNHP, and (ii) to monitor costs and target the uptake of new rental housing by low-income groups. \nIt will also support the NHDCL in monitoring and reporting on the achievement of the project \n \n1  Government of Bhutan, Ministry of Works and Human Settlement. 2020.

The TA will also support the Ministry of Works and Human \nSettlement (MOWHS) in improving the policy framework, strengthening regulatory frameworks \nthat are beyond the remit of the NHDCL, strengthening the capacity and systems to manage the \nproject effectively, and implementing the housing management information system (MIS). The \nADB team discussed the scope of the TA with the NHDCL during the fact-finding mission in June\u2013\nAugust 2021.5 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n4.  Output 1: Housing policy and land management improved. The TA will support the \nexecuting and implementing agencies to  \n(i)  review and formulate the updated NHP (emphasizing green building principles and \nclimate and disaster risk reduction measures); \n(ii)  prepare a housing information management proposal, including land and property \ninformation; and \n(iii)  review the housing value chain (e.g., mortgage lending, subsidy arrangements, \npotential  for  a  housing  fund,  and  housing  construction,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance). \n \n5.  Output 2: Resilience of beneficiaries consolidated. The TA will help \n(i)  review and update the national building code; \n(ii)  raise awareness and build capacity on climate- and disaster-resilient housing \ndesigns, standards, and relevant code provisions; encourage resilient building \npractices; and provide support to vulnerable households; and \n(iii)  standardize training and capacity building for engineers, architects, planners, and \ntradespeople across the construction and housing sector. \n \n6.  Output 3: Housing management information system established. The TA will  \n(i)  strengthen the capacity and knowledge of the MOWHS on the analytical tools \nrequired for an effective housing provider implementation strategy and for meeting \nsector needs; \n(ii)  design and implement a housing MIS; and \n(iii)  train the NHDCL and the MOWHS to use the housing MIS. \n \n7.  Output 4: Safeguards management system strengthened. The TA will assist NHDCL to  \n(i)  set up a safeguard unit within the NHDCL; \n(ii)  prepare and implement operational safeguard management guidelines; and \n(iii)  provide awareness building activities and training to promote environment and social \nsafeguard implementation and compliance. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n8.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.1 million, of which $1.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u20137). The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 1.  \n \n \n5 The TA is included in the ADB. Forthcoming. Indicative Country Pipeline and Monitoring Report: Bhutan, 2022\u20132024. \nManila.
