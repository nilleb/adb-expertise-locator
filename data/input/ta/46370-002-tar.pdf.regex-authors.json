INTRODUCTION \n1.  By transitioning quickly to a market economy and democracy, Myanmar hopes to enter a \nsustained period of economic growth. Modernizing the country\u2019s transport system will support \nthis transformation. It is estimated that Myanmar\u2019s per capita gross domestic product could \nquadruple from 2010 to 2030, reaching $3,500, if the Government of Myanmar implements \nnecessary market policies and large infrastructure investments, particularly those aimed at \nrehabilitating and improving Myanmar\u2019s highway network.1  \n \n2.  The  government  has  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  a  capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance (TA) to enhance its road safety and asset management \ncapacity. First, ADB helped the Ministry of Construction (MOC) set up a road inventory, as well \nas assess and prioritize pavement maintenance and improvement needs.2 ADB also provided \nadvice  on  road  safety  and  priority  actions.3 Building  on  these  measures,  the  government \nrequested support to build the capacity of the Department of Highways (DOH)4 and the Road \nTransport  Administration  Department  (RTAD)  to  prepare  and  deliver  new  network-wide \nprograms of road safety improvements, and highway rehabilitation works.  \n \n3.  This report is based on understandings reached with the government during the TA \nreconnaissance mission fielded in June 2015. It reflects agreements reached on the impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Inadequate  investment,  technology,  and  maintenance  have  rendered  Myanmar\u2019s \nhighway network underdeveloped, unsafe, and in poor condition. This constrains the economic \ndevelopment of the country, which relies heavily on its roads for national and international \ntransport.  Periodic  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  programs  and  safety  improvements  will \nimprove the condition of Myanmar\u2019s highway network and reduce the number of road accidents. \n \n5.  Myanmar\u2019s highway network is extensive but low in quality. In 2014, Myanmar had \n157,000 kilometers (km) of roads, of which only 34,700 km were paved. The country\u2019s network \nof trunk roads extends for over 40,000 km and is managed by the DOH under the MOC. Despite \nsignificant investment over the past decade, only 53% of these roads are currently paved. Of \nthe paved trunk roads, two-thirds are only 12 feet wide, and half are in poor condition, requiring \nimmediate rehabilitation. Vehicle speeds are slow, road alignments often dangerous, and basic \nsafety features generally missing.  \n \n6.  This situation is rooted in the method and magnitude of government investment in the \nroad sector. In recent decades, Myanmar has spent about 1% of its gross domestic product on \ntrunk roads (against 2%\u20133% in comparable countries), with spending long earmarked for remote \nareas rather than the core network, and standards kept low. More recently, the government has \ndedicated resources to widening roads, but without improving alignments. Pavements have \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2014. Myanmar: Unlocking the Potential. Country Diagnostic Study. Manila.  \n2  ADB. 2013. Draft Final Report for TA-8327. Developing the Asset Management Program for Myanmar Roads. Nay \nPyi Taw. \n3  ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance for Improving Road Safety in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Manila \n(TA 8075-REG). \n4  This department was formerly known as the Department of Public Works. \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 September 2015.  \n ", "2   \nbeen  maintained  and  repaired,  but  these  measures  have  generally  fallen  short  of  lasting \nimprovements. For most road works, the DOH has applied low quality standards and relied on \nlabor-intensive techniques. This has kept costs and technology requirements low, and enabled \na sizeable expansion of the network; however, the economic impact of this expansion has been \nlimited.  Road  transport  remains  costly  and  slow,  even  on  Myanmar\u2019s  main  roads  and \ninternational corridors. \n \n7.  With  assistance  from  ADB,  the  MOC  has  assessed  highway  maintenance  and \nimprovement  needs  and  prepared  a  medium-term  plan  for  improving  highway  conditions \n(footnote 2). The TA successfully created the first computerized inventory of the MOC network, \nsurveyed the condition of 27,000 km of highways, set up a pavement management system, and \nidentified a medium-term investment priority plan.  \n \n8.  To  implement  the  plan  and  modernize  the  road  network,  past  practices  must  be \ndiscontinued. Investments must increase and focus on main roads where traffic is important. \nHighway  pavements  should  be  rehabilitated  and  equipped  with  better  safety  features. \nTechnologies  and  delivery  mechanisms  must  be  changed,  the  use  of  asphalt  concrete \ngeneralized, and labor-intensive methods phased out on high-volume roads. This will require \noutsourcing works, rather than carrying them out by force account. Contracting mechanisms on \nhighways  managed  by  private  concessionaires  will  also  need  to  be  improved.6 Future  TA \nprojects will help the MOC implement these changes gradually. \n \n9.  Road safety in Myanmar has also reached a critical juncture. The number of road-related \ndeaths has doubled since 2009, reaching 4,300 in 2014, and one-third of all injuries reported in \nhospitals  are  from  road  crashes.  While  the  level  of  fatalities  remains  below  that  in  other \nSoutheast Asian countries, this is largely because Myanmar\u2019s motorization rates are still low. \nOver the next 5 years, the number of annual fatalities is expected to double once more, and \ncould reach 15,000 by 2025 if the situation continues unchecked.  \n \n10.  Although the Myanmar Road Safety Action Plan, 2014\u20132020 under the National Road \nSafety Council provides a robust institutional framework for road safety management, it is at risk \nof remaining unimplemented because the RTAD and DOH lack the capacity to design safety \nenhancing programs and update the regulatory framework. In 2015, ADB carried out a rapid \nassessment of road safety in Myanmar and trained officials in preparing road safety projects \n(footnote 3). The assistance was successful and led to the identification of priority actions and \npossible demonstration projects; however, the RTAD and DOH do not have enough staff skilled \nin road safety to develop the projects fully. \n \n11.  Improving the pavement of trunk roads with established traffic would have significant \neconomic benefits. By focusing on higher priority roads, a medium-term program of periodic \nmaintenance and rehabilitation of about 4,000 km of paved highways at a cost of $1.2 billion \nmay save approximately $30 billion in transport costs over 15 years. Improving highway safety \ncould expand these benefits further. The number of road crashes has been increasing by more \nthan 15% each year. Road safety investments could slow this trend and reduce crash severity. \nReducing the number of crashes by 20% would save more than 40,000 lives over 15 years and \nadd $5.7 billion to Myanmar\u2019s economy.7 \n \n                                                 \n6  About 5,500 km of MOC highways are managed under so-called build\u2013operate\u2013transfer contracts. \n7  ADB. Forthcoming. Transport Sector Policy Note. Manila. \n ", "  3 \n12.  On 30 March 2015, the minister of construction sent a letter to ADB (i) expressing high \nsatisfaction with the results of the previous TA project, (ii) announcing that the DOH had set up \ntwo road asset management units and a road safety unit based on ADB\u2019s recommendations, \nand  (iii)  asking  ADB  for  further  highway  asset  management  support.  The  Ministry  of  Rail \nTransportation and the RTAD also requested ADB support to help implement the National Road \nSafety Action Plan. This TA project forms part of ADB\u2019s response. ADB is also considering \nfinancing  the  DOH\u2019s  program  for  the  periodic  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  of  highway \npavement, as well safety demonstration projects under the planned 2017 Transport Sector \nModernization Program.8 \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The TA is aligned with Myanmar\u2019s 2014 National Transport Sector Development Master \nPlan,  which  hopes  to  develop  safe,  all-weather  infrastructure  for  road  transport.9 The  TA \noutcome  will  enhance  the  government\u2019s  road  safety  and  asset  management  capacity. \nSpecifically, the TA seeks to enable the DOH and RTAD to launch new programs relating to \nroad safety and the periodic maintenance and rehabilitation of highway pavements. These \nprograms may be financed by the government, ADB, other development partners, or the private \nsector. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  Output 1: Road safety programs and management capacity developed. The TA will \ndevelop road safety programs and capacity in the RTAD and DOH. The TA will support the \nDOH by (i) reviewing current road safety engineering practices and recommending new or \nimproved practices, (ii) carrying out safety audits and crash risk surveys of highways with high \ntraffic, (iii) developing a medium-term road safety investment program (in coordination with the \nRTAD), and (iv) helping establish the DOH\u2019s new road safety unit.  \n \n15.  The TA will advise the RTAD on (i) auditing road safety, (ii) developing a road crash data \nsystem, (iii) improving the national driver licensing system, (iv) developing a demerit licensing \nsystem linking police offence data with driver licenses, (v) improving heavy commercial vehicle \nsafety, and (vi) developing a road safety research system. It will also (i) carry out policy reviews, \n(ii) prioritize actions for the National Road Safety Action Plan, and (iii) review highway accident \npatterns.  \n  \n16.  Output  2:  Periodic  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  program  and  management \ncapacity  for  highways  developed.  The TA will help the DOH prepare and implement a \nprogram of periodic maintenance and rehabilitation for highways, prioritized with the DOH\u2019s road \nasset management system (RAMS). The TA will (i) review and recommend improvements to \npavement  repair  design  and  implementation  practices,  (ii)  prepare  a  design  guideline  for \npavement  periodic  maintenance  and  rehabilitation;  (iii)  recommend  main  features  and  an \napproach for the program; (iv) recommend performance standards for maintenance contracts; (v) \nrecommend  tendering  process  and  supervision  procedures;  (vi)  prepare  model  bidding \ndocuments; (vii) prepare an operational manual covering program  and project preparation, \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2013.

Nay Pyi Taw. \n ", "4   \nmanagement, delivery, and monitoring; and (viii) help establish implementation arrangements \nand train staff. \n \n17.  Output 3: Demonstration projects prepared. The TA will prepare the first phases of \nthe  road  safety  investment  and  periodic  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  programs.  It  is \nestimated that the TA will help prepare pavement repair and improvement works on at least 500 \nkm of highways. These works may include asphalt concrete or penetration macadam overlays, \npavement  rehabilitation,  and  shoulder  repairs  and  improvements.  These  measures  will  be \nconfined to the current road width and will not require full reconstruction or widening of the road. \nRoad safety demonstration projects are expected to consist of (i) blackspot treatments, (ii) the \ninstallation of safety features on dangerous corridors, and (iii) targeted infrastructure (e.g., for \nmotorcycles and pedestrians) combined with coordinated actions from road safety stakeholders. \nFor each subproject, the TA will prepare basic engineering designs using standardized cross-\nsections, typical drawings and costing, initial environmental evaluation, bidding documents, and \neconomic analysis.  \n \n18.  Output 4: Road asset management system institutionalized within the Department \nof Highways. Under the previous TA, the DOH developed a road database and pavement \nmanagement  system  (footnote  2).  This  output  will  help  upgrade  and  institutionalize  those \nsystems. The TA will (i) develop key maintenance performance indicators and standards; (ii) \nprepare the first DOH annual report; (iii) improve maintenance prioritization; (iv) improve the \npavement management system calibration to improve its success rate and facilitate its use by \nfield  staff;  (v)  develop  and  implement  new  RAMS  functions  (global  positioning  system \ncenterlines, video logging, a drainage inventory, a geographic information system interface, and \nstandard reports); (vi) train and help the RAMS units carry out new surveys and database \nupdates; and (vii) help implement necessary policies and processes. \n \n19.  Myanmar\u2019s economic and democratic transition presents both opportunities and risks for \ndevelopment projects. The general elections scheduled for November 2015, the subsequent \ntransition period, and the new government\u2019s accession by March 2016 make policy continuity \nuncertain. However, the change of government should not affect the TA objectives because (i) \nthe civil servants composing the office of the MOC permanent secretary will remain in office \nafter the elections, (ii) improving road pavements is highly likely to remain an economic priority, \nand (iii) the flexible program design can accommodate specific government requests. As in any \ncountry, the new government may not prioritize road asset management and safety when \nmaking investment decisions. The TA will partly mitigate this risk by building the capacity of \ngovernment agencies to provide evidence justifying these expenditures. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,050,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of (i) counterpart staff; (ii) an appropriate furnished office \nin Nay Pyi Taw; (iii) local communications in Nay Pyi Taw; (iv) local transportation for site visits; \n(v) vehicles and staff for surveys; (vi) logistical assistance to organize events; (vii) access to \nrelevant information, staff, data, and reports; and (viii) other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The MOC will be the executing agency and the DOH will be the implementing agency. \nThe RTAD and DOH will form a project steering committee. ADB will also set up a technical \n ", "  5 \nreview committee to ensure the quality of the TA products. The TA will be implemented over 23 \nmonths from 1 March 2016 to 31 January 2018. \n \n22.  The TA will provide 54 person-months of international consultant inputs and 88 person-\nmonths  of  national  consultant  inputs  in  the  following  areas:  road  management,  road \nmaintenance  planning,  road  management  systems,  information  technology,  pavement \nmaintenance engineering, road safety management, road safety engineering, road maintenance \ncontracting, environmental management, and social development. ADB will recruit consultants \nin accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). ADB will recruit a consulting firm using a quality- and cost-based selection method with a \nquality to cost ratio of 90:10, following submission of full technical proposal. ADB will also recruit \nresource persons to form a TA technical review committee and participate in review workshops.  \n \n23.  Consultants  will  manage  surveys,  workshops,  training,  and  seminars  under  the  TA \nbudget. Equipment will be procured in compliance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, \nas amended from time to time). The assets and equipment procured under the TA will be \nhanded over to the executing agency and/or implementing agency when the TA is completed. \nProceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  line  with  the  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n24.  ADB will monitor and evaluate the TA based on the design and monitoring framework \nand according to standard ADB procedures. Parts of the final TA report may be published and \ndisseminated. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION  \n25.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to the Government of Myanmar to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Improving Road Network \nManagement and Safety. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \n \nAll-weather  and  safe  road  transport  infrastructure  developed  by  2030  (National  Transport  Sector \nDevelopment Master Plan, 2014)a \n \nProject Results  Performance Indicators with Targets  Data Sources \nChain  and Baselines  and Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By 2019    Delays and loss \nGovernment road  a.
