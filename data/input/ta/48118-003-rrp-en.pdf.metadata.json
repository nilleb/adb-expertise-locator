THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the additional financing of the Greater \nMekong Subregion Health Security Project.1 \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the ongoing project on 22 November 2016 \nfor  $125  million  equivalent  from  its  ordinary  capital  resources.2 Building  on  ADB\u2019s  prior \ninvestments in communicable disease control (CDC) in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS),3 \nthe ongoing project aims to strengthen regional cooperation and subnational CDC systems, \nparticularly in border areas. The impact of the ongoing project is strengthened GMS public health \nsecurity.  The  outcome  is  GMS  health  system  performance  with  regard  to  health  security \nimproved. As of 7 May 2020, the Lao PDR has officially reported 19 confirmed coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) cases, with evidence of limited local transmission.4 While the cases remain \nrelatively limited, there are serious concerns about the level of preparedness in the event of any \npandemic resurgence. The proposed additional financing for the Lao PDR aims to scale up the \nongoing project\u2019s interventions in emerging infectious diseases, particularly COVID-19.5 It will \nsupport the Government of the Lao PDR\u2019s National Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-\n19,6 which aims to mitigate the impact of possible large-scale community transmission and \nimprove pandemic preparedness. The additional financing will address the immediate needs for \nprocuring and distributing essential medical supplies and equipment, scaling up capacity for \nlaboratory testing and case management, and strengthening the health system for coping with \nsimilar emerging infectious disease outbreaks in the medium and long term. The report and \nrecommendation of the President for the ongoing project is accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The proposed project meets the eligibility criteria for additional financing. The impact and \noutcome of the project remain unchanged. The implementation of the ongoing project in the Lao \nPDR is on track as of 30 April 2020. Against an elapsed time of 59%, cumulative contract awards \nfor the loan and grant are $7.05 million (59% of ADB financing), and cumulative disbursements \nare $8.51 million (71% of ADB financing). All safeguard and financial covenants have either been \nachieved or are being complied with.7 The delivery of expected outputs is rated successful, and \nthe project is on track to achieve the intended output and outcome indicators. The identified \n \n1  This Report and Recommendation of the President has been prepared using the simplified template for additional \nfinancing approved in March 2020.  \n2   The ongoing project comprises (i) loans to Cambodia (SDR15,012,000 [$21 million]), the Lao PDR (SDR2,856,000 \n[$4 million]), Myanmar ($12 million), and Viet Nam (SDR56,946,000 [$80 million]); and (ii) a grant to the Lao PDR \n($8 million). ADB also provided project preparatory technical assistance of $1.3 million to Cambodia, the Lao PDR, \nMyanmar, and Viet Nam. ADB. Regional: Greater Mekong Subregion Health Security Project; and ADB.

The Government of Myanmar is also \nconsidering additional financing under the ongoing project to scale-up COVID-19 response. \n6  Government of the Lao PDR, Ministry of Health. 2020. National Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19. \nVientiane.   \n7  See detailed discussion on covenants in footnote d of Table 3. \n   \n ", "2 \nproject implementation risks have been adequately addressed, and the management of risks is \nrated successful. \n \n4.  The additional financing interventions are aligned with outputs 2 and 3 of the ongoing \nproject to improve surveillance and strengthen the laboratory system and hospital infection \nprevention and control (IPC). The additional investment in lab testing and hospital service capacity \nwill meet the greater than anticipated need during any COVID-19 outbreak that the country may \nexperience when the economy opens up after the current containment measures are relaxed \n(para. 6). The project interventions will be expanded from 15 to all 17 provinces of the Lao PDR. \nThe  existing  project  management  unit  can  expedite  implementation  of  the  new  activities. \nTherefore, the additional financing is considered the most responsive and appropriate approach \nfor delivering the urgently needed assistance. The proposed additional financing has been \ndetermined to be technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound (Table 3). \n  \n5.  The GMS Health Sector Working Group8 met in December 2019 and reconfirmed their \nstrong  commitment  to  regional  health  security  and  achieving  the  core  capacities  of  the \nInternational Health Regulations (2005).9 They endorsed the GMS Health Cooperation Strategy \n2019-2023,10 which the project continues to support. The overall project remains consistent with \nthe ADB Strategy 2030,11 and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the Lao PDR, 2017\u20132020, \nwhich prioritizes investment for enhanced human development.12  \n \n6.  The Lao PDR is highly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic as many migrant workers \nare returning from heavily affected neighboring countries.13 The National Preparedness and \nResponse Plan has projected that in the scenario of widespread community transmission, the \ncountry could have 20,000 cases at the peak, of which about 4,500 will be severe or critical cases \nthat need hospitalization. Although the country has made steady progress under previous and \nongoing CDC projects (footnote 2) to improve the response capacity to emerging infectious \ndiseases, its health system remains weak and could be overwhelmed by rapid spread of the virus. \nAt the end of 2019, the Lao PDR had 190 beds for critical care, 74 working ventilators, and only \n118 doctors and 222 nurses working in intensive care units in all central and provincial hospitals. \nThe three central reference laboratories can perform about 300 COVID-19 confirmation tests per \nday, whereas the plan targets at scaling up to 1,000 tests per day including adding capacity in \nselected  provinces.  Further,  the  country faces  a  severe  shortage  of medical  supplies  and \nequipment to mitigate the impact of possible large-scale community transmission. This includes \n(i) personal protective equipment (e.g., masks, gowns, goggles, and gloves) and disinfectants; (ii) \nlaboratory  equipment, testing  kits,  and  other  consumables;  (iii) equipment  and  supplies  for \nsupportive treatment in hospitals;14 and (iv) ambulances and other vehicles. The government has \nrequested the proposed additional financing to procure part of the supplies and equipment on \ntheir master procurement list.15 In addition, rapid training on IPC and case management for \n \n8  The working group is composed of senior health officials from GMS countries and is supported by ADB.  \n9  WHO. 2005.

The committee has compiled \n \n ", "3 \nfrontline health workers is needed to protect them from infection and improve the effectiveness of \nclinical care. The additional financing will also support broader whole-of-society interventions, as \naccurate information and effective risk communication are critical for mitigating the risks of \nwidespread community transmission.  \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n7.  The project impact and outcome will remain the same. The additional financing proposes \na new output: emergency response to the COVID-19 outbreak supported (output 4). The main \nactivities under output 4 include: (i) the procurement and distribution of medical supplies and \nequipment (items in para. 6) to hospitals at all levels according to needs, including equipping \nLuang Prabang, Savannakhet, and Champasak, three of the largest provinces in the Lao PDR, \nwith COVID-19 confirmation test capacity of about 150-180 per day in each province. (ii) rapid \ntraining for frontline health workers on IPC, lab testing, and clinical care for COVID-19; and (iii) \nsome non-pharmaceutical interventions, including risk communications and contact tracing. While \nthe activities fall within the scope of outputs 2 and 3 of the ongoing project, a new output is \nproposed for effectiveness and efficiency in administration and monitoring. The revised design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB   \n \n8.  ADB is a trusted and leading development partner in the health sector in the Lao PDR, \nwith more than two decades of continuous engagement. Through the ongoing project and the \nHealth Sector Governance Program,16 ADB has supported the government\u2019s Health Sector \nReform Strategy, including strengthening communicable disease surveillance and response. The \nongoing project supported Ministry of Health (MOH)\u2019s procurement of the first batch of COVID-19 \nresponse supplies and equipment in March 2020. The strategic long-term investment in CDC as \na regional public good in the GMS may have contributed to the relatively well-managed COVID-\n19 outbreak in the subregion so far.17 A new project under preparation since 2019 will focus on \nimproving the quality of health care and achieving universal health coverage by 2025. The Lao \nPDR benefits from regional knowledge platforms hosted by ADB for knowledge sharing and \nregional cooperation through ongoing technical assistance on GMS health cooperation.18  \n \n9.  Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, ADB has quickly responded to requests from \nSoutheast Asian countries with timely, scaled, coordinated, and practical solutions that meet the \nneeds of governments.19 To facilitate rapid assistance to COVID-19 response, ADB applies a \nstreamlined approval process and more flexible procurement rules.20 ADB has also established \nstrategic  partnerships  with  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies,  and  facilitated  project \nprocurement planning by linking the MOH with credible global suppliers to cope with the volatility \nof the global supply market for COVID-19 medical equipment and consumables.

The additional financing entails no major changes to the implementation arrangements. \nThe MOH, represented by the Department of Planning and Cooperation, remains the executing \nagency in the Lao PDR. Two additional provincial health offices will be added as implementing \nagencies.23 The project will engage international procurement agents to facilitate the procurement \nof goods. The implementation arrangements are described in detail in the project administration \nmanual (footnote 22).   \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Summary Due Diligence Results \n \n14.  A summary of the due diligence assessments carried out for the proposed additional \nfinancing is presented in Table 3. The full due diligence assessments are accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2.  \n \nTable 3: Summary of Due Diligence Assessments \nArea of \nAssessment  Summary of Assessment \nEconomic  Following  the  2017  ADB  guidelines  on  economic  analysis,a  the  cost-effectiveness  analysis \nand financial  conducted for the additional financing shows that the cost per DALY is less than GDP per capita, \nviability  making the intervention very cost-effective.b The cost\u2013benefit analysis conducted for the original \nproject was also updated. An EIRR of 29.4% was estimated for the proposed additional financing \nproject, which is above the minimum required threshold of 6% for social sector investments. \nSustainability   The project is likely to be sustainable given the government\u2019s commitment to cover operational and \nmaintenance costs. The government continues to provide strong support to the health sector and \n \n23 In the ongoing project, 15 provincial health offices, the Communicable Disease Control Department, and the National \nCenter for Laboratory and Epidemiology are the key implementing agencies. \n ", "6 \nArea of \nAssessment  Summary of Assessment \nincreased health sector funding from 2015 to 2019, allowing enough headroom to absorb recurrent \ncosts after implementation. However, with high fiscal debt and low reserves, broader economic \npressures remain. The IMF\u2019s 2019 debt sustainability analysis assessed the Lao PDR at high risk \nfor debt distress.c It also underlines the country\u2019s high exposure to contingent liability risks, especially \nthose related to state-owned enterprises in the energy sector.d COVID-19 will almost certainly \nexacerbate these challenges, and support from development partners is critical in promoting \nmacroeconomic stability. \nGovernance  The pre-mitigation financial management risk of the project is rated substantial. Emergency response \nmay result in lack of preparedness of the procurement and financial management system and \nprocesses. The additional financing will continue to use the PFM system developed under the \nongoing project, for which no major issues have been identified to date. A separate advance account \nwill be established. The State Audit Organization will perform external audits on all additional \nfinancing activities as part of the annual audit process for the overall project. With the mitigations, \nthe risk is moderate. \nAn procurement assessment was undertaken to ensure value for money and the effectiveness of the \nemergency procurement; mitigate risks around supply chain volatility, security, and quality of the \nsupply;  and  include  the  consideration  of  technical  support  required  for  the  installation, \ncommissioning, and maintenance of specialized equipment. \nPoverty,  Poverty. COVID-19 is expected to affect household incomes negatively. It is likely to result in \nsocial, and  100,000 more people living below the poverty line of $1.9/day, 200,000 more people living below \ngender  $3.2/day, and another 200,000 more people living below $5.5/day.e Maximum preparedness \ncontributes to the mitigation of the negative impacts. \nGender. The additional financing is categorized some gender elements. An updated gender action \nplan has been prepared.f As the main activities under the additional financing are procurement of \nmedical supplies and equipment, gender features that can be accomplished within its scope are \nlimited. The project will ensure that PPE fits female and male health workers, and will support the \ndevelopment  of  gender-responsive  guidelines,  protocols,  and  training  materials  to  take  into \nconsideration the different needs, experiences, and impacts of COVID-19 on males and females. \nThe ongoing project remains effective gender mainstreaming. \nSafeguards  The additional financing is classified category C for environmental safeguards, as it will not involve \nany civil works or any activities in environmentally sensitive areas. The ongoing project remains \ncategory B for environment.  \nThe additional financing is classified category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples \nimpacts. No land acquisition or resettlement impacts are envisaged. Indigenous peoples will not be \nspecifically targeted, so no direct or indirect impacts are envisaged. The ongoing project remains \ncategory C for involuntary resettlement and category B for indigenous peoples.  \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  COVID-19  =  coronavirus  disease,  DALY  =  disability-adjusted  life  year, \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International Monetary Fund, Lao PDR = \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, PFM = public financial management, PPE = personal protective equipment. \na  ADB. 2017.
