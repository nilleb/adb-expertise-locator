As part of its mandate to formulate and implement national laws, policies and standards \nconcerning  local  government  operations,  the  Philippine  Department  of  Interior  and  Local \nGovernment (DILG) has been working for several years with local governments to develop \nperformance  measurement  and  assessment  tools  to  help  local  governments  improve  local \ngovernance  and  service  delivery.  DILG  would  like  to  strengthen  the  existing  performance \nmeasurement framework to enhance local government development, improve access to and \nuse of data by stakeholders, and provide input to national policy making on local government \nissues. Hence, the Government requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance during \nthe  2002  country  programming  mission  for  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  support \ndevelopment of an enhanced local governance performance measurement system. A fact-\nfinding mission was fielded in September 2002 and reached broad understanding with the \nGovernment  on  the  goal,  purpose,  scope,  implementing  arrangements,  cost  estimates, \nfinancing plan, and terms of reference for the TA. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  Philippines,  a  forerunner  in  Asia  in  introducing  comprehensive  decentralization \nreforms, enacted the Local Government Code (LGC) in 1991. The code devolves to the local \nlevel  significant  responsibilities  for  delivery  of  services  in  areas  including  agriculture, \nenvironment, local infrastructure, health and urban services, and places them at the forefront of \nefforts  to  reduce  poverty.  The  State  of  Local  Government  Address  in  20012  notes  that \ndecentralization  has  encouraged  greater  innovation  at  the  local  level,  strengthened  local \nmanagement capacity, and promoted greater cooperation with the private sector and Local \nGovernment  Units  (LGUs).  However,  despite  these  achievements  the  full  benefits  of \ndecentralization, in terms of improved service delivery particularly to the poor, have yet to be \nrealized as local governments face a number of resource constraints, including limited financial \nresources,  underdeveloped  capacity  for  planning  and  resource  management,  and  weak \ninformation systems. \n \n3.   Enhancing  LGU  capacity  to  deliver  quality  services  hinges  on  long-term  capacity \nbuilding aimed at (i) improved assessment and collection of own revenue to reduce dependence \non the Internal Revenue Allotment; (ii) strengthening planning, budgeting, resource allocation, \nand expenditure and financial management; (iii) improved quality of public administration; and \n(iv) better governance through strengthening accountability and transparency mechanisms. All \nof these will require improvements in the quality, availability, management, and use of data in a \ncoherent  performance  management  framework.  This  is  consistent  with  the  growing  shift, \ninternationally, toward introducing performance-based planning, budgeting, and management to \nenhance the efficiency and effectiveness of government services and the development of tools \nand systems to monitor and improve performance.  \n \n4.  A well functioning performance management system based on accurate and timely \ninformation  will  assist  LGUs  to  perform  their  mandates  in  a  number  of  ways.  Improved \ncollection,  analysis,  use,  and  dissemination  of  data  on  government  capacity,  development \nstatus, and performance support the principles of greater accountability, transparency, and \nparticipation. It provides information to citizens on what their local government is mandated by \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in September 2002  \n2 State of Local Government Address, delivered by Secretary Jose D. Lina, Jr., to the First Philippine Local   \nGovernance Congress, Manila, 10 October 2001 ", "2 \nlaw to provide and enables them to provide feedback on the quality of services received. It \nenables local governments to identify and analyze problems in service delivery, and serves as a \nkey input to planning and resource allocation decisions. Enhancing local revenues requires data \non the current capacity to generate income, collect taxes, and analyze policy and administration \ngaps. Private sector investment at the local government level is constrained by a lack of \ninformation on local government performance and creditworthiness. Performance data enables \nbetter  pro-poor  targeting  of  development  assistance  by  responsible  national  government \nagencies and international development partners. Information on development status, local \ngovernment capacity and program effectiveness also assists national level policymaking on \nlocal government issues. \n \n5.  To address some of the information gaps, DILG has been working with LGUs and \nexternal funding agencies for several years to develop performance and assessment tools for \nlocal government. For the most part, however, the tools were designed to help DILG determine \nthe capabilities and limitations of LGUs in the performance of their roles and responsibilities \nunder  the  Local  Government  Code,  consistent  with  the  DILG  mandate  to  formulate  and \nimplement  policies,  standards,  and  projects  to  promote  local  autonomy  and  oversee  local \ngovernment operations. In addition, a recent study conducted by the Philippine Business for \nSocial Progress showed that 12 funding agencies have been working since 1995 with 20 \npartner  agencies  (public  and  private)  to  develop  performance  indicators,  resulting  in  the \ngeneration  of  almost  400  indicators  of  local  government  performance  across  17  sectors.3 \nHowever, most of this data is not analyzed and made available to LGUs in a form that feeds into \nimproving services. Such a proliferation of indicators is unwieldy and inefficient, duplicates \ninformation, and places undue burdens on LGUs to supply information. Despite the number of \nindicators it is extremely difficult at present to get a consolidated picture of the status and \nperformance of LGUs as not all indicators are disaggregated below the provincial level, data are \nmaintained by a number of different institutions, not all data is publicly available, and the \naccuracy and timeliness of data has been questioned.  \n \n6.  At the joint Government-Donor Forum on Local Government Benchmarking in January \n2002 it was agreed that the Government needed to form a technical working group to compile \nan inventory of the numerous indicators maintained by national government agencies, and to \npropose a system for consolidating these into a workable, integrated performance measurement \nsystem. The technical working group4 nominated DILG as the appropriate focal agency for \nmonitoring local government performance, and agreed that DILG should enhance its local \nproductivity and performance measurement system (LPPMS)5 as the primary database on local \ngovernment performance. The LPPMS was developed during 2000 as a first step in compiling \nperformance data on good governance, administration, social development, local legislation, \nlocal economic development, and environmental management. The system currently stores \ninformation provided by LGUs on a self-assessment basis, but has a number of limitations as a \nmanagement tool. It was agreed that although the Department of Finance, the Department of \nBudget and Management, and Commission on Audit would continue to develop and maintain \ntheir own databases on local government financial indicators, this information would also be \nintegrated  into  the  enhanced  LPPMS,  to  be  known  as  the  local  governance  performance \nmeasurement system (LGPMS). \n                                                 \n3  Philippine Business for Social Progress. 2002, January. Compilation of Indicators of Good Governance. (A report \npresented for the Donor Forum on LGU Benchmarking, Manila.) \n4  The working group comprised representatives from DILG, Department of Finance, and Department of Budget and \nManagement as the primary oversight agencies that maintain local government databases. \n5  Developed with support from the Canadian International Development Agency Local Government Support Program \nduring 2000. ", "    3 \n7.  In addition to the LPPMS, DILG previously initiated two related projects, which will be \nintegrated into the LGPMS. The local development watch system was piloted in 36 LGUs and \ncollects social, economic, and environmental indicators that can be reflected diagrammatically \nto provide an overview of the development status of LGUs. The citizens satisfaction index \nsystem is intended to provide citizens feedback on the quality, coverage, and accessibility of \nbasic services, but has not yet been developed. The integration of the three systems, plus the \nexchange of data with other national government agencies, will (i) enable the validation of data; \n(ii)  provide  more  detailed  information  as  inputs  to  LGU  planning,  resource  allocation,  and \nmanagement; (iii) allow the benchmarking of local government performance against agreed \nstandards;6 (iv) improve the analysis of LGU capacity and development status; and (v) improve \nthe usefulness of the data to a variety of stakeholders. \n \n8.  The first phase of developing the LGPMS is anticipated to be completed in May 2003, so \nthat information generated can be used in the LGU planning and budgeting cycle for 2004. The \nfirst phase involves upgrading the capacity of DILG offices to assist LGUs to collect, collate, \nanalyze and disseminate information and to upgrade the technical capabilities of the information \nsystem. The project is divided into four interrelated components: (i) system design, (ii) system \ndevelopment, (iii) system testing and capacity building, and (iv) data gathering. The activities \nunder this TA will complete the system design and development components of the project. The \nother components are being funded by DILG and other donors, primarily Australia Agency for \nInternational  Development,  Canadian  International  Development  Agency-Local  Government \nSupport Program (CIDA-LGSP), and United Nations Development Programme.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The long-term goal of ADB\u2019s assistance is to enhance the capacity of national and local \ngovernment to improve local government management, service delivery, and development. The \nTA will assist the Government to strengthen the performance management framework for local \ngovernment  by  providing  tools  and  systems  for  assessing  local  government  capacity  and \nperformance. \n \n10.  The TA consists of three interrelated components: (i) the design and development of an \nintegrated database with enhanced capacity for the analysis, management, and sharing of data; \n(ii) upgrading of hardware in the national and provincial offices of DILG to improve the efficiency \nand effectiveness of the information system; and (iii) the development of user guides and \nmanuals. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  Systems Development. Since an overarching objective of the integrated database is to \nconsolidate performance information and reduce the reporting burden on local governments, \nbefore software is developed, agreement will be reached between relevant national government \nagencies on the core design features, data sharing, and use of outputs from the system. \nDiscussions  between  relevant  agencies  are  under  way.  The  analysis  and  selection  of \nappropriate software is a critical step in the development cycle, as the architecture of the \nLGPMS will determine the capacity of end-users to manage and manipulate data, analyze LGU \nperformance,  and  share  information  with  other  stakeholders.  The  LPPMS  system  was \n                                                 \n6  Including the local government code and millennium development goals. ", "4 \ndeveloped as a Microsoft-Access-based application with limited ability for users to analyze data, \nsearch the database and produce the variety of reports required. The structures, data capture \nprocesses, and other components of the three existing systems will need to be analyzed to \ndetermine the most appropriate system design, taking into account issues of compatibility with \ndata systems of other government agencies and the need to have the system work with the \nInternet. \n \n12.  Data Integration. The core LPPMS system was focused more on meeting the needs of \nBureau of Local Government Supervision (BLGS) than those of LGUs and other stakeholders. It \nalso relied exclusively on self-assessment by LGUs without validating information from other \nsources,  particularly  from  citizens.  Integrating  data  from  all  three  existing  systems,  plus \ninformation from oversight agencies such as the Department of Finance, Department of Budget \nand Management, National Economic Development Authority, and National Statistics Office) will \nimprove the integrity of the output and enable users to get a broader picture of the economic, \nfinancial, social, and environmental status of LGUs. An integrated database increases the \nanalytical capability of the system and will allow DILG to develop a single set of tools and \nprocedures for data collection, management, and use. However, the three existing systems \nwere  developed  with  different  software  applications  and  data  currently  residing  in  those \ndatabases needs to be merged into one database. Capability will also have to be built in to \nimport and export data between databases maintained by other government agencies. \n \n13.  Data Management. The management and dissemination of data has been inefficient \nowing to capacity constraints. Some data have to be transmitted in paper form between the \nlocal, provincial, regional, and national levels and entered into the system more than once, \nwhich reduces the integrity of the data. For example, although almost 90% of LGUs provided \ninformation  during  2000,  the  national  database  contains  data  on  less  than  75%  of  these, \nalthough the information is available at other levels. The processes of collecting, compiling and \nanalyzing data have to be significantly speeded up for the data to be useful as a management \ntool. The provincial DILG offices act as the data hubs, as the collection, collation, storage and \ndissemination points for data from all LGUs within the province. However, only 57 out of 79 \nprovincial DILG offices have computers available for running the system. Limited capacity exists \nfor maintenance of the provincial databases or user support. The BLGS maintains the national \ndatabase,  compiling  provincial  data  and  integrating  data  from  other  national  agencies, \nperforming data analysis and disseminating data to stakeholders. Its current systems lack the \nstorage and analytical capability to effectively manage the enhanced national database and \ndisseminate  timely  information.  The  TA  will  support  enhanced  data  management  and \ndissemination, which will necessitate some hardware upgrading, for BLGS and the provincial \noffices to (i) ensure basic functionality of the new system; (ii) test the software developed; and \n(iii) increase accessibility of data to DILG and LGU users. \n \n14.  Capacity Building. Training will be required for LGU officials in using the upgraded \nsystem  and  in  interpreting  the  data  to  improve  planning,  management,  and  development \nactivities. Most capacity building for LGUs will take place through user manuals and training by \nmunicipal local government operations officers. Customized training materials will be developed \nand workshops conducted for (i) provincial staff who will collect and encode data; (ii) municipal \nlocal government operations officers, on analyzing data outputs and preparing reports; (iii) \ndatabase administrators; and (iv) technical training for staff who will need to maintain and \ncustomize the software applications. This TA will support the development of user manuals for \ndatabase administrators and technical personnel, as other training activities are being funded \nfrom other sources. \n ", "    5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $290,000 equivalent, comprising $152,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $138,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  provide  a  grant  of \n$200,000 to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $48,000 equivalent of the local currency \ncosts.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  ADB-funded  TA  program.  The \nGovernment will finance $90,000 equivalent of the local costs, through the provision of office \naccommodation and facilities, use of equipment, administrative support, remuneration and per \ndiem of counterpart staff, counterpart staff travel, and staff training. CIDA-LGSP will, in parallel, \nfinance $160,000 to support the project management unit (PMU) and provide further capacity \nbuilding. A detailed cost estimate is provided in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  DILG will be the Executing Agency. The TA will be led by the LGPMS team, which is the \nPMU within the Bureau of Local Government Supervision. The team will be led by a full-time \nproject manager funded by CIDA-LGSP and will be responsible for organizing the technical and \nadministrative aspects of the TA, and for supervising coordination with other activities linked to \nimplementation of the LGPMS. PMU staff will support the work of the consultants and facilitate \nthe consultants\u2019 work by ensuring access to relevant data and documents. The TA consultants \nwill provide full support to the project manager. The project manager will report to the Director, \nBLGS. \n \n17.  The TA will require inputs of approximately 4 person-months of international and 5 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consultants  with  expertise  in  database  management,  systems \ndevelopment, and programming. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. The TA consultants will be based in Metro Manila and be \nrequired to travel to provincial offices of DILG as necessary. Equipment will be purchased by the \nPMU in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The outline terms of reference for \nthe TA consultants are included in Appendix 3. \n \n18.  The TA is expected to commence in November 2002 and be implemented over 7 \nmonths, to be completed in May 2003. The consultants will produce (i) an inception report at the \nend of the first month, including the design specifications of the data model, structure, and \nagreements for data sharing with other national agencies; (ii) a draft final report; and (iii) a final \nreport at the end of the assignment, including data dictionaries and operating manuals. Training \nand dissemination workshops will be hosted by DILG to familiarize stakeholders with the system \nand to provide training for DILG staff and LGUs in the use of the enhanced database. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  Philippines  for  Support  for  the  Local  Governance  Performance \nMeasurement System, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
