In Papua New Guinea (PNG), more than 90% of the population (mostly rural dwellers) \nhas no electricity. In urban centers, the power supply is often unreliable. The country\u2019s medium \nterm development strategy 2005\u201320101 recognizes energy and power as critical ingredients for \ndevelopment  and  poverty  reduction.  The  strategy  aims  to  assist  the  disadvantaged  to  \u201clift \nthemselves out of poverty by improving basic services such as water and electricity.\u201d The \nGovernment has asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA) to prepare the Power Sector Development Project. \n \n2.  Lending assistance to the country\u2019s power sector was included in ADB\u2019s country strategy \nand  program  2006\u20132010  for  PNG 2  and  confirmed  during  the  2007  and  2008  country \nprogramming missions. ADB approved the PPTA concept paper in February 2008.3 The ADB \nFact-Finding  Mission  visited  PNG  in  April  2008.  An  understanding  was  reached  with  the \nGovernment  on  the  PPTA\u2019s  purpose,  key  activities,  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference,  cost \nestimates  and  financing,  and  implementation  arrangements.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \nA.  The Power Sector \n \n3.  PNG has significant natural resources, including energy, but the country\u2019s formidable \ngeography and the high cost of developing infrastructure have constrained their exploitation. \nThe outcome is a dual economy and society, marked by a few enclaves of industrialization \nsurrounded by widely diffused poverty. The high population growth rate (2.3% per annum) and \nincreasing urbanization have increased difficulties for the country. The challenge is for PNG to \nuse its energy resources to move the country toward more sustainable social and economic \ndevelopment.  \n \n4.  PNG has substantial deposits of hydrocarbons, mainly natural gas. The recoverable \nproved and probable natural gas resources are estimated at 428 billion cubic meters (m3), \nequivalent to about 3 billion barrels of oil.4 Planning and design work are proceeding for the \nproduction of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for export. The pipeline carrying gas from onshore gas \nfields to the planned LNG plant may enable the supply of natural gas to domestic users, \nparticularly power generators. The country is rich in renewable energy resources suitable for \npower  production,  particularly  hydropower.  PNG  has  more  than  15,000  megawatts  (MW) \nhydropower potential. Coconut plantations are widely spread throughout PNG and may be a \npotential source of power as coconut-based bio-diesel becomes a viable option. Other potential \nenergy  sources  are  geothermal,  wind,  solar  and  marine.  There  is  no  single  solution.  The \ngeography of PNG calls for articulated power sector optimization based on small, disaggregated \nmarkets.  \n \n5.  Currently, there is no national power grid. The electricity network is located around more \npopulated areas and industrial sites. PNG Power Limited (PPL), the national state-owned power \nutility, has installed generation capacity of 300 MW (80 MW in Port Moresby). At least another \n                                                 \n1  PNG. 2004. Medium Term Development Strategy 2005\u20132010: Our Plan for Economic and Social Advancement. \nPort Moresby.  \n2  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132010): Papua New Guinea. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 April 2008. \n4  The remaining proved recoverable oil reserves are estimated at 80 million barrels. \n ", "2   \n280 MW belongs to other entities, most of which is used for self-consumption. Of the country\u2019s \ntotal 580 MW generating capacity, hydropower comprises 220 MW. A combination of light and \nheavy oil-fired diesel units comprises 60 MW to supply Port Moresby. A 62 MW gas plant and \n54  MW  geothermal  plant  each  supply  isolated  mines.  The  remaining  184  MW  generating \ncapacity uses light diesel fuel, mainly in isolated centers scattered through the country. \n \n6.  PPL  supplies  power  to  Port  Moresby  and  26  other  urban  centers  through \n19 independent power systems. In 2005, it supplied 629 gigawatt-hours (GWh)\u2014316 GWh in \nPort Moresby\u2014to 73,500 customers. However, many generating stations require overhaul and \nmaintenance. Of the 300 MW installed capacity, about 250 MW are capable of producing power. \nEnergy system losses equal about 20% of energy input to the system. They continue to rise \nover time from about 13% in the late 1990s because of outdated transmission and distribution \nlines, and inadequate substation plants.  \n \n7.  PPL used to be the sole generator, transmitter, and distributor of electricity in the country. \nIn 1999, an independent power producer, Hanjung Power Ltd., negotiated an agreement with \nPPL for the production and sale of power to the grid within a 15-year build-operate-transfer \narrangement.  The Energy Division of the Department of Petroleum and Energy (ED-DPE) is \nresponsible for the rural electrification program. The provincial governments have responsibility \nfor maintaining the Government\u2019s stand-alone rural generation facilities (C-Centers), although \nmost of these centers have fallen into poor condition and disuse since their inception. There are \nseveral other power suppliers. Churches and missions provide electricity to nearby areas while \nsome mine, industrial, and agricultural enclaves supply free electricity to nearby villages. PPL \nhas an ongoing program of extending the urban grids to sell electricity to rural communities \nclose to urban centers. A new private commercial operator, PNG Sustainable Energy Limited \n(SEL)5 is also actively entering the sector. The World Bank is assisting SEL with a solar lantern \nproject  for  teachers,  and  it  is  discussing  possible  assistance  to  finance  mini-hydropower \nschemes in rural areas. \n \nB.  The Power Sector Development Plan \n \n8.  In  2007,  ADB  approved  the  Power  Sector  Development  Plan  advisory  technical \nassistance (TA).6 The scope of this assistance includes (i) review of the draft sector policy \nframework; and (ii) based on this framework, prepare the power demand forecast and least-cost \nsupply development plan, and an action-oriented and monitorable power sector operational \nprogram. The main findings of this TA are expected in December 2008 (draft final report) and \nthe final report by March 2009. \n \n9.  Three policy drafts have been circulated and widely discussed within the Government \nand concerned stakeholders: the draft Energy Policy, the draft Electricity Industry Policy and the \ndraft Rural Electrification Policy. The draft Electricity Industry Policy is the most advanced and \nclosest to being adopted. It provides exclusive service areas for PPL, though it allows for third \nparty producers in the form of feed-in and for use of facilities. It allows for free entry of private \nsector producers to serve large customers with loads of 10 MW or more and also third party \ninvestment in generation, retailing and network activities in areas outside current PPL exclusive \nareas, which include rural areas. The framework uses a standard pricing in the shape of \n                                                 \n5  SEL is a joint venture (50\u201350) between PNG Sustainable Development Program Limited (PNGSDP) and Snowy \nMountain Engineering Company (SMEC), Australia. \n6  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for the Power Sector Development Plan. Manila (TA 4932, \napproved on 25 May, for $630,000). \n ", "  3\nnational single tariff and envisages an Electricity Trust Fund to finance subsidies for rural areas.  \n \n10.  Three main issues are still debated among stakeholders: subsidies and the country-wide \nuniform tariff; the PPL exclusivity provision; and third party access. In particular, the price cap \n(average cost) uniform tariff allows PPL cross-subsidies from urban to rural and from large \ncommercial/industrial to residential customers. The cross subsidies and the proposed Electricity \nTrust  Fund  for  more  remote  areas  are  seen  as  necessary  to  maintain  the  affordability  of \nelectricity access in high cost areas. However, subsidies represent a financial burden and, in \nsome instances, might not be necessary. SEL is running commercially sustainable mini-grids in \nthe Western Province charging a tariff that is twice that of PPL.  \n \n11.  The demand for electricity has been estimated for all districts in PNG and for the three \ngrids: Port Moresby, Ramu and Gazelle. Demand is forecasted to grow in the next 20 years \nfrom 616.4 GWh to 4,916.8 GWh. The forecast assumes the supply7 of the presently unmet \ndemand and that, at the end of the 20-year period, about 25% of the population in PNG will \nhave access to electricity.8  \n \n12.  With current peak demands of 80 MW and 60 MW respectively, the Port Moresby and \nRamu systems will require the most capital investment. The sector development strategy for \nPort Moresby includes (i) the replacement of the old diesel generation units with new plants \ncapable of burning heavy fuel oil and convertible to gas; as well as (ii) in the event of the LNG \nproject materializing, negotiations of terms for the off-take of gas from the gas pipeline to Port \nMoresby; and (iii) as an alternative to LNG, the development of hydropower potential in the \nAngabanga, Vanapa and Brown River Basins.9  \n \n13.  It is worth noting that the LNG development requires large amount of power, mainly for \nchilling purposes. This requirement could be in the hundreds of MW and would be powered by \npipeline gas. One avenue to explore with gas-fired generation is the possibility of the LNG \nproducer acting as an independent power producer, where it would supply the Port Moresby \ngrid, at limited incremental cost above its own requirements. \n \n14.  For the Ramu system, further development will likely be driven by new industrial mega-\nprojects, such as Wafi and Yandera.10 Supply will be enhanced with the development of the \nRamu 2 hydropower plant (120 MW), with most of this output (around 90 MW) destined for the \nRamu Nickel mine. Possible interconnection between the Port Moresby and the Ramu systems \nwill be explored in the event of sufficient surplus hydropower on the Ramu system.  \n \n15.  The  power  sector  development  plan  will  create  the  foundation  of  a  power  sector \ndevelopment project to increase the availability of reliable and sustainable power supply at \nreasonable cost. The investment(s) to be financed under the power sector development project \nmay include LNG-based and/or priority hydropower facilities, the relative transmission line to the \ntown grid, and power distribution enhancement and rehabilitation. \n                                                 \n7  For example, the peak load of the Port Moresby system is close to 80 MW, although it is estimated that there is \nanother 10 MW or so \u201csuppressed demand\u201d. \n8  For the residential consumers, the demand has been estimated by adopting an end-use approach based on \nprototypes of urban and rural households along six steps of the energy ladder. From step 1, where the household \nuses primitive energy sources such as wood for lighting and cooking to step 6, where it uses modern clean energy \nsuch as electricity and gas. \n9  Hydropower and gas-based power production have comparable costs. However, hydropower has higher cost \nuncertainties and longer lead-time requirements. \n10 The Wafi and Yandera mines combined demand is expected to be in the 300 MW range. \n ", "4   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  The PPTA impact will be increased availability of reliable and sustainable power supply \nat reasonable cost. The PPTA outcome will be a power sector development project design \nagreed  between  the  Government  of  PNG  and  ADB.  The  PPTA  outputs  will  include  the \n(i) updated least-cost power sector development plan, (ii) preliminary design and costing of \nprioritized  core  subprojects,  (iii)  financial  and  economic  analysis  of  the  power  sector \ndevelopment  plan  and  its  core  subprojects,  (iv)  environmental  and  social  safeguards  due \ndiligence  of  the  core  subprojects,11 (v)  climate-proofing  analysis,  (vi)  recommendations  for \npower sector governance framework, and (vii) public consultations and an awareness campaign.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n17.  Building on the findings and recommendations of the advisory TA on a Power Sector \nDevelopment  Plan,  a  detailed  study  of  the  power  sector  structure,  financial  restructuring, \npoverty reduction, private sector participation, and investment planning will be undertaken. \nAdvice  on  policy  matters  and  stakeholder  participation  will  be  provided  throughout  PPTA \nimplementation. The PPTA activities will include (i) assisting the Government to finalize the \npower demand development plan, including load forecast and least-cost supply solution; (ii) \nexplore  ways  to  expand  private  sector  participation  in  the  power  sector;  (iii)  prepare  the \nfeasibility  studies  of  prioritized  core  subprojects,  including  procurement  packages  and  bid \ndocuments; (iv) secure safeguards\u2019 capacity development and assist preparation of the social \nand  environmental  safeguards;  (v)  undertake  stakeholders  consultation  and  capacity \ndevelopment; and (vi) conduct awareness campaign and dissemination of results.  \n \n18.  To ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies on the environment, involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  people,  the  PPTA  will  review  the  existing  work  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s procedures and, if required, conduct supplementary detailed field surveys for \ncore subprojects, including access roads. To analyze the way in which the envisaged project is \nlinked to poverty reduction, a poverty analysis will be undertaken using data collected from field \nconsultations. Particular attention will be paid to the affordability of up-front connection charges \nand monthly bills. Indicators for benefits monitoring will also be prepared. Appendix 2 provides \nthe summary initial poverty and social analysis. \n \n19.  Since individual subprojects\u2014which could not yield benefits if considered singly\u2014are \npart of the power sector expansion program, a time-slice approach will be used in the economic \nand financial analysis of the project. A distribution analysis will be conducted to assess the \ndistribution and net benefits and cross-subsidies among key stakeholders. Risks and the effects \nof various delays in commissioning of generation plants on financial and economic results will \nbe analyzed.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The total cost of the PPTA is $1,500,000 equivalent. The Government has asked ADB to \nfinance $1,200,000. The PPTA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, \nfunded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  Government  of  PNG  will  contribute \n                                                 \n11  If the due diligence indicates that involuntary resettlement may be involved, the PPTA may need to prepare a short \nresettlement plan for the core subprojects and a resettlement framework for the project. \n ", "  5\n$300,000 equivalent to finance counterpart staff, office accommodation, communication, local \ntransport,  and  consultations  and  awareness  facilitation.  The  detailed  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of the \nPPTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  ED-DPE will be the Executing Agency (EA) of the PPTA. The EA will facilitate the \ncollection of all available relevant information. It will provide office space and counterpart staff, \nincluding  a  project  manager  with  qualifications  acceptable  to  ADB  on  terms  of  reference \nprepared by the EA and reviewed by ADB. The director of ED-DPE will provide overall guidance \nto the project. It is proposed that a steering committee be chaired by the Department of National \nPlanning and Monitoring and could include representatives of ED-DPE; Department of  Treasury, \nof Works Environment and Conservation, and of Provincial and Local Government Affairs; PPL; \nSEL; private sector representatives; nongovernment organizations; and users. The committee \nwill provide overall supervision and help to ensure adequate cooperation from local government \nbodies, governments, and nongovernment organizations active in the power sector, as well as \nusers and beneficiaries. The Consultative Implementation and Monitoring Council might be \nconsidered for the role of secretariat to the steering committee.  \n \n22.  ADB will engage about 26 person-months of international and 26 person-months of \nnational consulting services. A consulting firm will be recruited through the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method based on the submission of full technical proposals and in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). 12 The \nquality-cost weighting ratio will be 80:20. Procurement of equipment and software will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) \nand  will  be  handed  over  to  the  EA  upon  completion  of  the  PPTA.  The  detailed  terms  of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 4.  \n \n23.  The PPTA will be implemented over 20 months, with services to be rendered on an \nintermittent basis. It is expected to begin in October 2008 and be completed by June 2010. \nWithin 6 weeks after commencement of the PPTA, the consultants will submit a brief inception \nreport summarizing their findings, identifying specific issues, and suggesting changes to the \nmethodology and program, if any. Within 10 months after commencement of the PPTA, the \nconsultants will submit the midterm report. A draft final report will be submitted within 18 months \nafter PPTA commencement. A tripartite meeting among the EA, ADB, and consultants will be \nconducted to discuss the draft final report and any changes to be made. The consultant will \nsubmit three copies, in electronic and hard copies, of all reports to ADB, the Government, and \nthe EA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,200,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Papua New Guinea for preparing the Power Sector Development Project, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n12  The international consulting firm will administer the training, seminars and conferences, maps and surveys, and \nmiscellaneous and administration and support costs.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions  \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nIncreased availability of  Share of households  PNG country economic  \u2022  Donors\u2019 financial \nreliable and sustainable  with power supply  and power sector statistics  assistance and the \npower supply at  increases from 7% to    Government\u2019s \nreasonable cost  12% within 8 years   PNG national budget  commitment to the \n      power sector is \nShare of electricity  ADB country consultations  maintained \nproduced by oil products   \ndecreases from 45% to  Risk \n35% within 6 years  \u2022  Poor understanding of \n  the power sector \nPower demand supplied  development plan and \nwith least-cost solutions  flawed policy adoption \nOutcome      Assumption \nA power sector  Draft final report  PPTA draft final report  \u2022  Recommended actions \ndevelopment project  submitted to the    accepted and endorsed \ndesign agreed between  Government and ADB  Government and steering  by the Government and \nthe Government and  and other agencies by  committee assessment  other stakeholders \nADB  January 2010     \n    ADB final review mission  Risk \nMemorandum of    \u2022  Insufficient public debate \nunderstanding agreed by  Feedback from  and/or support for the \nADB and the  stakeholders, including  PPTA recommendations \nGovernment for further  donors   \nprocessing of the loan \nand associated TA by \nMarch 2010 \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nIn Papua New Guinea (PNG), more than 90% of the population (mostly rural dwellers) has no electricity. In urban centers, the \npower supply is often unreliable. The country\u2019s medium term development strategy 2005\u20132010 recognizes energy and power \nas critical ingredients for development and poverty reduction. It aims to assist the disadvantaged to \u201clift themselves out of \npoverty by improving basic services such as water and electricity.\u201d \n \nPNG has significant natural resources, including energy reserves, but the country\u2019s formidable geography and the high cost of \ndeveloping infrastructure have constrained their exploitation. The challenge is for PNG to use its energy resources to help \nreverse a negative spiral and to move the country toward more sustainable social and economic development. This vision is \narticulated in the national energy policy, which aims \u201cto diligently promote and facilitate the development of the energy sector \nin order to ensure the availability, reliability, affordability and efficient use of energy. Therefore, social development occurs by \nutilizing energy for economic activity, through an environment sound manner.\u201da \n \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n \nLimited power supply affordability, availability, and reliability are a strain for the economy as well as the quality of life of the \npeople. The project aims to address these limitations by providing more reliable power supply in the country, and it will \ncontribute to PNG\u2019s general economic growth\u2014essential to support poverty reduction in the country. Improving the delivery of \nclean water and electricity was identified as a major priority of the poor. \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.   If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)/due diligence? \nNo PPTA resources are specifically allocated to poverty analysis. However, the terms of reference require such analysis by \nthe team leader to help guide the design of subprojects. \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \nThe ultimate impact of the project\u2014to increase the affordability, availability, and reliability of power\u2014is pro-poor. Key \ncomponents of the project are the discussion/identification of the willingness/ability of the poor to pay for power, eventual \ncross-subsidies, and access to power supply services. \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? \nEnergy consumers in the commercial, industrial and domestic (including poor households) sectors are the primary direct \nbeneficiaries of the project. The poor will also benefit indirectly from the countries\u2019 improved trade balance and fiscal position, \nwhich result from improved power supply efficiency because more foreign exchange and public resources will become \navailable and could be spent  on social services.  \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \nTo be identified. \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nWhat are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address them? \nTo be identified. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \nCommercial, industrial, government, and domestic power consumers, in both urban and rural areas; government planning \ndepartments  and  other  government  stakeholder  ministries;  power  producers;  the  private  sector;  and  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs). \n \n2. What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, \ncommunity mobilization, involvement of NGOs and community-based organizations, etc.)? \nThe PPTA will include capacity development and stakeholders\u2019 public consultations and workshops, ensuring full participation \nof women and vulnerable groups at all stages of the PPTA. \n \nAt the country level, the project will be implemented through a project steering committee that will represent all key stakeholder \ngroups. Workshops and meetings will be held under the auspices of the steering committee to ensure that awareness and \nproject information (and opportunity for feedback) is widely disseminated. \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \nThe PPTA includes a strategy for improvement of public awareness and education. The C&P will be considered in the \nsubsequent Asian Development Bank (ADB)/Global Environment Facility (GEF) project. \n \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \nGender issues are not prominent in this project, except among domestic energy consumers of which the majority (in terms of \nenergy consumed) are women. More available and reliable power can benefit women, as they will free up household budgets \nfor increased expenditure on non-energy household services. \n \n2.  Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision \nmaking?       Yes          No    Please explain.  \nAt the residential level, women (who are chiefly responsible for energy consumption in households) will have a leading role. To \nthe extent that the residential sector will be provided with more reliable power, women will be empowered by having a better \nservice and quality of life. \n \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality? \n          Yes          No    Please explain  \nImproved power supply will have no impact or a slightly positive impact on women and girls, and will have no effect on gender \ninequality. \n \nIII.

PPTA/DUE DILIGENCE RESOURCE REQUIREMENT \n1.  Do the TOR for the PPTA (or other due diligence) include poverty, social and gender analysis and the relevant specialist/s? \n        Yes                    No   If no, please explain why.      \n \nNone are needed as the project has an inherent pro-poor impact and there are no significant gender issues. \n \n2.  Are resources (consultants, survey budget, and workshop) allocated for conducting poverty, social and/or gender analysis, \nand C&P during the PPTA/due diligence?       Yes           No    If no, please explain why. \n \nNone  are  needed  (see  above).
