Specifically, the proposal is for: \n \n(i)  A  cluster  comprising  two  loans  to  support  policy  reforms  for \nfinancial governance and social security. The first loan (Phase \nI) will consist of three tranches and will be implemented during \n2002 to 2003. Subject to satisfactory progress under Phase I, \nthe second loan (Phase II) will proceed and be implemented \nover 2003 to 2005. \n \n(ii)  Technical assistance for Phase I for financial governance and \nsocial security reform. \nCluster   \n   \nRationale  The Asian economic crisis highlighted Indonesia\u2019s weak regulatory \nand supervisory framework and the risks associated with vulnerable \nfinancial structures in a financially integrated world. Vulnerabilities in \nIndonesia  stemmed  from  strategic  weaknesses  including \n(i) excessive  dependence  on  bank  financing  characterized  by \nimprudent lending; (ii) a small and underdeveloped nonbank financial \nsector; (iii) lack of accountability, independence, and adequateness \nof regulation and supervision; and (iv) weak corporate governance. \nTo  promote  the  soundness  and  stability  of  Indonesia\u2019s  financial \nsystem and promote economic growth, the Government needs to \nlaunch broad-based financial sector reforms, strengthen frameworks \nfor  financial  sector  regulation  and  supervision,  and  establish  an \neffective anti-money laundering regime.  \n \nDuring the crisis, a large proportion of the population dropped below \nthe poverty line and a significant proportion currently remain there, \nhighlighting the need to establish adequate social protection systems \nand retirement income. To address this need, the Government needs \nto improve the governance and design of mandatory pension and \nretirement  schemes,  improve  fiscal  sustainability  of  programs, \nestablish  a  national  law  for  social  security  to  provide  a  unified \nframework for social security reform, and increase coverage of social \nsecurity systems to a broader segment of the population. \n   \nObjectives and Scope  The FGSSR will build upon the core reforms of INO-Loan 1618: \nFinancial  Governance  Reforms  Sector  Development  Program.1 \nPhase I will support a broad framework for the overall strengthening \nof  the  financial  sector  and  promote  the  development  of  sound \nfinancial  institutions  necessary  to  support  good  governance  and \neconomic growth. It also aims to improve social protection through \n                                                 \n1   Approved in 1998 for $1.4 billion. ", "iv  \nimproved governance, supervision, and regulation of pension funds \nand mandatory social insurance programs. Sustainable economic \ndevelopment  and  growth  in  Indonesia  depend  on  strengthening \ngovernance, financial supervision, and regulation. Robust economic \ngrowth  will  also  help  the  country  create  jobs,  raise  standards  of \nliving, and reduce poverty. \n \nTo promote consistency, efficiency, and harmonization of supervision \nacross  financial  services  and  products,  Phase  I  will  support  the \nestablishment of a consolidated regulatory and supervisory authority \n(OJK) for the financial sector. In the pre-OJK transition period of \n2002\u20132004, Phase I will (i) support preparation of comprehensive \nlegal reform necessary to transfer regulatory and supervisory powers \nto  OJK;  (ii) support  development  of  an  effective  anti-money \nlaundering  regime;  (iii) strengthen  financial  sector  regulation  and \nsupervision  under  existing  authorities;  (iv) improve  corporate \ngovernance; and (v) promote adoption of international best practices \nand standards for regulation and supervision. \n \nTo  strengthen  the  national  social  security  system,  Phase  I  will \n(i) support the development of a law for a national social security \nsystem; (ii) improve supervision and governance of mandatory social \ninsurance  and  social  security  programs  by  bringing  the  related \nentities  under  the  jurisdiction  of  OJK;  (iii) support  measures  to \nimprove  fiscal  sustainability  of  mandatory  programs;  (iv) improve \nprograms  to  provide  adequate  retirement  income;  (v) support \ndevelopment of a unified identification system for social security to \nimprove administration of benefits; (vi) assess potential options for \nexpanding coverage of social security systems to the informal sector; \nand (vi) undertake a special audit of the mandatory social insurance \nscheme for formal sector workers and independent financial reviews \nof insurance firms to support reforms and restructuring. Phase II will \ncontinue  support  for  Phase  I  reforms,  and  include  measures  to \nsupport broader social security reform and restructuring as needed. \n   \nClassification  Economic growth \n   \nEnvironment  Category C \nAssessment \n   \nLoan Amount and  It is proposed to support Phase I in three tranches of $100 million, \nTerms  $50  million,  and  $100 million  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources \n(OCR)  under  the  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; an interest rate determined in \naccordance with ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment \ncharge of 0.75% per annum; a front-end fee of 1.0%; conversion \noptions that may be exercised in accordance with the draft loan \nagreement, the loan regulations, and ADB\u2019s conversion guidelines; \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement. \n ", "  v\nPhase  II  will  be  presented  for  Board  consideration,  based  on \nsatisfactory implementation of Phase I. Policy actions for Phase II \nare subject to revision depending upon ADB\u2019s reassessment of the \nmacroeconomic  environment,  further  sector  information  and \nanalyses conducted, lessons learned under Phase I, and status of \nimplementation and readiness of the Government to undertake the \nproposed policy reform actions. \n   \nProgram Period and  The Government will be able to withdraw funds from the Phase I \nTranching  account during a period of 1 year from loan effectiveness. Phase I \nloan will be disbursed in three tranches. The first tranche, equivalent \nto $100 million, will be made available upon the Government meeting \nthe conditions of loan effectiveness. An additional incentive tranche \nof  $50  million  and  the  second  tranche  of  $100 million,  which  is \nexpected to be released within eight months of loan effectiveness, \nwill  be  released  upon  satisfactory  compliance  with  agreed-upon \nconditions.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs (CMEA) will act as \nthe Executing Agency for the FGSSR to facilitate (i) the necessary \ncoordination  across  multiple  implementing  agencies  for \nimplementation of reforms and (ii) a smooth transition from Phase I \nto Phase II as regulatory and supervisory powers are transferred \nfrom existing authorities to OJK. \n   \nProcurement and  In  accordance  with  the  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and \nDisbursement  related requirements for program loans, procurement of goods and \n \nservices produced in and originating from ADB's member countries \nwill be made with due consideration to economy and efficiency in \naccordance with standard Indonesian public sector procedures and \nnormal  private  sector  commercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB. \nDisbursement of the loan proceeds will be permitted on the basis of \na certification provided by the Borrower, confirming that in each year \nin which proceeds of the Phase I loan are expected to be disbursed, \nthe  value  of  total  Indonesian  imports  minus  (i) imports  from \nnonmember countries, (ii) ineligible imports, and (iii) imports financed \nunder  other  official  development  assistance,  will  be  equal  to  or \ngreater than the amounts expected to be disbursed during that year. \nADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and verify \nthe validity of the certification issued by the Government with each \nwithdrawal application. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The counterpart funds to be generated out of the loan proceeds will \nbe used to finance the cost of structural adjustments and activities \nconsistent with the FGSSR. \n   \nRisks and Safeguards  The  implementation  of  the  FGSSR  could  be  affected  by  various \nfactors.  The  principal  risk  relates  to  the  potential  for  continuing \npolitical uncertainty, civil conflict or unrest, and their effect on the \npace of structural reforms. However, there is a firm commitment to \nfinancial governance and social security reform at the highest levels ", "vi  \nof  Government,  and  consequently  the  risk  of  the  Program  being \ndiluted or abandoned is reduced. \n \nThe  other  risk  stems  from  resistance  by  vested  interests  to  the \nreforms, particularly since the FGSSR covers sensitive areas, such \nas  social  security  reform,  restructuring  and  consolidation  of  the \ninsurance industry, and anti-money laundering. The Government has \nbeen gradually overcoming resistance in these areas as necessary \nsteps for reform are being undertaken. Delays may also occur in the \nimplementation of reforms due to lack of capacity. TA support will be \nprovided  under  the  FGSSR  to  help  address  this  risk,  and  the \nGovernment has identified areas where it will require assistance. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  Technical  assistance  will  be  provided,  at  the  request  of  the \nGovernment,  for  $1.0 million  financed  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding \nprogram  to  support  implementation  of  the  FGSSR,  including  a \nfeasibility study for social security reforms, options for restructuring \nexisting  public  social  insurance  schemes,  and  assistance  in  the \ndevelopment of a new law for national social security.  \n ", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) the proposed \ncluster for the Financial Governance and Social Security Reform Program (FGSSR) in the Republic \nof Indonesia and (ii) the proposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia for Phase I of the FGSSR. The \nreport also describes technical assistance (TA) to support the implementation of the FGSSR, and if \nthe Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \nshall approve the TA. \n \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT1 \n \n2.  Reflecting weak external demand, the Indonesian economy posted a modest economic \nperformance in the first half of 2002, growing by 2.9% year on year. External demand is expected \nto remain weak during the remainder of 2002, and the impact of the Bali bombings will further \nserve to dampen growth prospects through their impact on the tourist industry (which accounted for \n3.7% of gross domestic product [GDP] in 2001) and on investor confidence. The economic fallout \nfrom  the  bombings  will  also  directly  and  significantly  add  to  an  already  high  and  rising \nunemployment rate, as the tourist industry alone employs some 9 million people. Any significant \nreduction in unemployment will require a return to precrisis growth rates of 6\u20137% per annum. \n \n3.  A return to a higher growth path is also crucial if Indonesia is to significantly reduce its \nheavy debt burden. Decentralization has shifted control over much revenue to local governments \nand the state budget for 2002 relies heavily on external financing\u2014projecting a deficit of 2.5% of \nGDP. Indonesia's debt burden, ballooned by the crisis, remains heavy and debt service obligations \nconstitute the largest single item of government expenditure, at 5.5% of GDP. Any significant \nreduction in the public debt will require, among other things, a sustained return to higher growth \nrates. \n \n4.  The financial sector clearly has a central role to play in the country\u2019s economic performance \nthrough  its  role  in  stimulating  savings  and  investment  and  in  supporting  productivity  growth. \nUndermining the potential for growth, however, are continued weaknesses in financial sector \ngovernance due to distortions in incentives created by the existing regulatory and institutional \nframework. Weak and uneven regulation and supervision have contributed to the development of a \nfragile,  structurally  unbalanced,  financial  sector  characterized  by  bank  dominance  and \nunderdeveloped  capital  markets.  Bank  lending  to  the  corporate  sector,  moreover,  has  been \nconstrained by the dead weight of nonperforming loans accumulated since the crisis. The sound \ndevelopment of alternative channels of financial intermediation (e.g., contractual savings, capital \nmarkets)  has  been  hindered  by  weaknesses  in  the  regulatory  framework  and  in  supervisory \ncapacity. The need for regulatory and institutional reforms is fundamental if financial sector stability \nis to be strengthened and the sector is to effectively play its crucial role in facilitating long-term \neconomic growth. \n \n                                                 \n1  This section provides a brief update on recent economic developments. It should be read in conjunction with ADB. \n2002. Country Economic Review: Indonesia. Manila. ", "2   \nIII.  THE SECTOR \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n \n5.  The financial sector in Indonesia is characterized by bank dominance and underdeveloped \ncapital markets. Combined assets of commercial and state banks in 2001 were over six times as \ngreat as the Jakarta Stock Exchange market capitalization (Table 1). In hindsight, one of the \nindicators signaling Indonesia's vulnerability to the crises might have been found in the heavily \nunbalanced composition of its financial sector. Postcrisis reforms in the banking sector have \nfocused on consolidation and recapitalization of the sector. Of the 239 banks operating prior to the \ncrisis, Indonesia closed 70 insolvent banks and initiated restructuring of seven state banks, 12 \nregional  development  banks,  and  20  private  national  banks.  Financial  sector  regulation  and \nsupervision are under the authority of three regulatory and supervisory authorities. Banks are \nregulated and supervised by the central bank, Bank Indonesia (BI); the capital markets by the \nCapital Market Supervisory Agency (Bapepam) under the Minister of Finance; and insurance, \npension,  finance,  and  venture-capital  companies  by  the  Directorate  General  of  Financial \nInstitutions (DGFI) in the Ministry of Finance.

Capital Markets \n \n6.  Like  many  emerging  markets,  the  capital  markets  in  Indonesia  are  small  and \nunderdeveloped  in  comparison  to  the  banking  sector.  By  the  end  of  2001,  there  were  189 \nsecurities companies licensed to act as broker-dealers, 116 licensed to act as underwriters, and 47 \nlicensed  to  act  as  investment  managers.  In  terms  of  institutional  investors,  there  were  347 \nemployers pension funds, 31 financial institution pension funds, 109 nonlife insurance companies, \n61 life insurance companies, 60 venture capital funds, 108 mutual funds, and 5 social insurance \ncompanies, including two public pension schemes and one mandatory provident fund (Table 2).

Under the existing Capital Market Law, stock exchanges in Indonesia are required to be in \nthe mutual form, so only those who are members have trading access. The ability of firms to raise \nfunds from Indonesia's capital markets has been limited by the small size and low liquidity of these \nmarkets. Market capitalization of the Jakarta Stock Exchange was only 16% of GDP in 2001, \namong the lowest in the region (Table 3).2 Apart from setbacks due to political and macroeconomic \ninstability, growth and development of capital markets in Indonesia has also been hindered by \nhighly concentrated share ownership patterns that contribute to low market liquidity and weak \ncorporate governance.3  \n \nTable 3: Selected Capital Market Indicators \n (Rp billion, unless otherwise indicated) \n \n  1997  1998  1999  2000  2001 \nMarket Capitalization (JSX)   \n   Value (Rp trillion)  159.9 175.7 451.8 259.6  239.3\n   % of GDP  25.5 18.4 40.7 20.1  16.0\nComposite Index (JSX)  401.7 398.0 676.9 416.3  392.0\nAverage Daily Trading Value (JSX)  489.4 403.6 598.7 513.7  396.4\nNumber of Listed Companies (JSX)  282 288 277 283  315\nInitial Public Offerings   \n   Number  34 3 12 25  32\n   Value   3,950.5 68.1 805.2 1,772.2  1,096.8\nBond Issuance   \n   Number  24 1 9 19  6\n   Value  7,205.0 150.0 4,284.0 5,613.0  2,875.0\nJSX = Jakarta Stock Exchange. \n  Sources: Jakarta Stock Exchange, Capital Market Supervisory Agency. \n                                                 \n2  By way of comparison, stock market capitalization as a percentage of GDP in the Philippines was 77.6% in 2000. \n3  Most listed companies are majority owned by the founding shareholders with the general public holding 20\u201330% of \nthe total shares. \n ", "4   \n \n8.  Research  indicates  that  prospective  local  investors  still  view  the  capital  market  as  a \ncomplicated  industry.4  Many  view  the  capital  markets  as  high  risk  and  in  general,  investor \npreference is for bank deposits. This is particularly pronounced among institutional investors, \nwhose portfolios are dominated by bank instruments. State-owned pension programs have over \n90% of their assets invested in bank deposits while the corresponding figure for private pension \nfunds is around 70%. Portfolio investment in the stock market from the insurance sector is also \nvery small. Of the Rp32 trillion investment portfolio of the insurance industry in 2000,5 time deposits \naccounted for almost 59% of investments, followed by private placements (11.4%), bonds (10.9%), \nand stocks (3.6%). Other factors impacting the size of the Indonesian capital markets include (i) a \nsmall institutional investor sector\u2014the combined assets of the pensions and insurance sectors \nwere Rp51.2 trillion or 3.4% of GDP in 2001; (ii) lack of a developed government bond market with \nsuitable benchmarks for corporate bonds and private issues of securities;6 (iii) access to funds \nthrough connected lending among industrial groups that include banks; and (iv) availability of lower \ncost offshore financing for multinationals and some large domestic firms. In addition, the increasing \ncorrelation among national markets due to globalization has reduced the incentive for industrial \ncountry investors to diversify into emerging markets. Overall, the trend in foreign investment in \nIndonesia has shown a decline from a roughly equal split between local and foreign investors in \n1996 to about 10% foreign participation in 2001. \n \n2.  Pension and Provident Funds  \n \n9.  The  old  age  or  retirement  benefit  system  in  Indonesia  targets  formal  sector  workers \nexclusively. There is no \u201cfirst pillar\u201d providing a minimum pension to the population. Approximately \n25 million people are currently covered under mandatory programs through state-run monopolies, \nand there are an additional 1.0 million participants in voluntary pension schemes. The Indonesian \nsocial  insurance  system  includes  three  mandatory  programs  covering  formal  private  sector \nworkers, civil servants, and the armed forces. Jamsostek (Jaminan Sosial Tenaga Kerja) is not a \npension  scheme,  but  a  mandatory  savings  scheme  that  provides  coverage  for  employees of \nprivate sector and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) with 10 or more employees or a monthly wage \ncost of at least Rp1 million. Taspen (Tabungan dan Asuransi Pegawai Negari) covers all civil \nservants and Asabri (Asuransi Social ABRI) covers the police, and civilian and military defense \npersonnel.  These  mandatory  schemes  can  be  supplemented  by  voluntary  pensions  (dana \npensiuns) of two types, employer pension funds (DPPKs) and financial institution pension funds \n(DPLKs). A summary overview of pension programs\u2019 membership, assets, liabilities, and cash flow \nis shown in Table 4. \n \n10.  The mandatory programs were established by separate laws7 and are under the purview of \nseparate ministries. The Jamsostek program is under the purview of the Ministry of Manpower and \nTransmigration, the Taspen program is controlled by the Ministry of Finance, and the Asabri \nprogram is controlled by the Ministry of Defense. The Ministry of Finance Pensions Directorate has \nauthority to supervise voluntary pension schemes, but not the mandatory programs of Asabri or \nJamsostek,  which  are  considered  effectively  unsupervised.

There  is  an  increasing  public  awareness  in  Indonesia  of  the  importance  of  voluntary, \nsupplemental  pensions  in  providing  adequate  income  during  retirement,  and  participants  in \nfinancial institution pension funds have increased by 55% from 260,277 in 1999 to 400,000 in \n2001. The employer-sponsored voluntary plans have also shown increases but on a lesser scale. \nAlthough still a small component of Indonesia\u2019s overall system, voluntary pension schemes can \nplay an important role in providing long-term security. Improvements in the supervisory and tax \nframeworks are needed. There are no formal licensing or training requirements for private fund \nmanagers, supervision needs improvement, and industry disclosure is slow. \n \n12.  The Jamsostek old age benefit is a mandatory savings scheme that pays a lump-sum \nbenefit upon (i) attaining the age of 55 years; (ii) death before the age of 55 years; or (iii) total and \npermanent disability. The program provides insufficient retirement income, representing a long-\nterm potential burden on the Government as workers become poor in old age. The low wage \nreplacement ratio (i.e., small retirement income) stems from factors including low contribution rates \nand  poor  investment  performance.  The  monopoly  status  of  the  program  has  precluded \ndevelopment of more effective schemes. In spite of its mandatory status, the compliance rate is \nonly around 45% due to a lack of confidence in Jamsostek and concerns over lack of transparency, \ndisclosure, and governance. In 2001, Jamsostek used an independent auditor for preparation of its \nannual statements. However, in July 2002, Indonesia\u2019s Supreme Audit Agency (BPK) asked a \nnumber of accounting firms to revise their audit reports on a group of state-owned enterprises as \nthey did not meet generally accepted accounting standards. This included Jamsostek. Jamsostek \n ", "6   \nhas operated with high overhead costs and many Jamsostek members have multiple identity \nnumbers, resulting in unconsolidated accounts and poor administration of benefits. \n \n13.  Improving the social security system has become a priority of Government in the aftermath \nof the Asian economic crisis. Participation in formal pension arrangements decreased along with \nthe rise in unemployment, as people focused on fulfilling immediate needs rather than saving for \nretirement.  During  the  crisis,  calls  for  better  management  of  Jamsostek  increased.  Some \nemployers pulled out from the fund, others stopped contributions, and some firms pooled their \ncontributions to manage themselves. Although the compulsory nature of the program is not often \nargued, elimination of the monopoly of its management by a government company is constantly \nchallenged. Privatizing the management of a provident fund can be supported with the view that \ngovernment should not be the market when the private sector can provide the products or services \non a competitive basis. In April 2002, a presidential team was established8 to lead development of \nnational policy on social security and to prepare a new law for a national social security system. \nThe team is evaluating the potential scope of the law including extending coverage to the informal \nsector.9 The law will act to unify social insurance schemes and provide a framework for integrating \nthe voluntary pensions sector. \n \n3.  Insurance Sector \n \n14.  The Indonesian insurance industry is characterized by a large number of companies in both \nthe life and nonlife sectors. At 31 December 2001, there were 61 life insurance companies, 109 \nnonlife insurance companies, and 5 social insurance companies (mandatory programs under state \nmonopolies).10 Approximately 25.3 million life policies were issued at year-end 2001, or one for \nevery eight members of the population. During the period 1996\u20132001, the number of life and \nnonlife insurance firms remained fairly stable, and combined assets increased over this time from \nRp12.9 trillion to Rp39.9 trillion (Table 1). Recent years have also shown rapid growth in gross \npremiums for the sector. These statistics, however, do not reveal the current condition of the \ninsurance sector and the urgent impending consolidation facing this industry.  \n \n15.  A life insurance company can continue to operate in a deficit situation, vulnerable to a \nfinancial shock, for many years if the deficit is not apparent and policyholders continue to pay \nsufficient premiums to meet current claims. Many insurance firms now suspending business or \nclosing were likely unsound before the crisis due to factors such as insufficient capital base, \noveroptimistic  product  pricing,  inadequate  reserves,  asset-liability  mismatches,  lack  of \nmanagement expertise and technical skills, and weak internal governance. Lax enforcement of \nregulations, weak supervision, and lack of independence of the Ministry of Finance Insurance \nDirectorate  to  carry  out  its  regulatory  and  supervisory  functions  were  also  factors.  Insurance \nregulating monitoring systems had been developed to provide sufficient advance information to the \nInsurance Directorate to avoid a situation of an insurer failing to meet obligations to policyholders, \n                                                 \n8  Decrees  include:  (i) August  2000  Coordinating  Minister  for  Welfare  and  Poverty  Alleviation  Decree  No. \n25/KEP/MENKO/KESRA/VIII/2000 Concerning the Team for Improvement of the National Social Security System; \n(ii) March 2001 Decree of the Secretary to the Vice President No. 7 of 2001 regarding Working Group of the National \nSocial Security System; and (iii) April 2002 Decree of the President No. 20 of 2002 regarding National Social \nInsurance System Team. \n9  The presidential team has been consulting with ADB, and ADB has provided some initial support.  \n10  Social insurance includes the mandatory pension and savings schemes. It also includes basic protection programs for \nworkers and their families against social risks in connection with industrial relations such as work accidents, death, \nhealth, and old age, and is carried by the five state monopolies: Jamsostek, Jasa Raharja, Taspen, Askes, and \nAsabri.  \n ", "  7\nbut political will has been lacking to take early action, and in some cases it was already too late for \nremedial measures. \n \n16.  Revised paid-up capital requirements were issued in 1999 and risk-based capital (RBC) \nrequirements were also introduced, with an allowance to phase in requirements up to 2004. This \nallowed firms adequate time to come into line with standards and aimed to encourage the industry \nto rehabilitate itself through rationalization and consolidation. To improve transparency of the \ninsurance industry to the public, the DGFI issued a decree in December 2001 requiring publication \nof insurance companies\u2019 financial position, solvency ratios, ownership of the firm, and names of \ndirectors. Although financial and solvency information may be difficult for an average policyholder \nto assess, this public disclosure provides a means to accelerate owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 actions to \nimprove conditions. It also facilitates enforcement by the Insurance Directorate by bringing the \ninformation into the public forum. The requirement for first publication of this information was in \nJune 2002.  \n \n17.  In August 2002, DGFI announced that six insurance firms had failed to meet the RBC \nrequirements, are under government order to restrict their operations, and may be closed by year-\nend. Five of these firms are in the life sector. Three additional firms, including two nonlife firms, \nhave voluntarily ceased business. DGFI also stated that another 30 firms have been put under its \nsurveillance. The first quarter 2002 data reported to the Insurance Directorate indicate that 25 life \ninsurance firms, representing 59% of market share in terms of gross premiums, have negative \nsolvency margins. This negative solvency represents a total capital deficiency of Rp5.86 trillion \n($651 million at an exchange rate of Rp9,000 = $1) in the life sector, compared to the nonlife \nsector, with 27 firms having negative solvency margins amounting to Rp59.8 billion ($6.6 million). \nOne major insurer accounts for over 85% of the capital deficiency among life insurance firms and \ncontinues to write new policies.    \n  \n18.  Policyholders under the five life firms slated for closure in 2002 totaled 440,638 at year-end \n2001. However, the number of policyholders affected by firms reporting negative solvency margins \namounts to 21,474,876, or 85% of policyholders. DGFI has not announced any measures to \naddress  policyholder  concerns  or  potential  losses.  Law  No. 8  of  1999  regarding  Consumer \nProtection  provides  for  the  establishment  of  a  consumer  protection  agency  and  a  consumer \ndisputes resolution body; however, neither has yet been established. Dispute resolution in the \ninsurance sector has been limited and controversial. In 2000, there were 121 complaint cases \nregarding claims settlement, though only 17 cases were settled in the corresponding year. From \nJanuary to July 2001, 72 claim settlement complaints were filed. Issues included claim denials, \nsettlements,  interpretation  of  policies,  the  amount  of  claims,  timely  issuance  of  policies,  and \nunclear explanation on provisions in the policies. \n   \n19.  In looking forward to address the capital needs of the insurance sector, firms may consider \npotential resources from foreign investors. There are presently 22 joint ventures operating in the \nlife sector and 23 in the nonlife sector. However, in 2002 a well-publicized bankruptcy case against \na solvent insurance firm brought international attention to the serious deficiencies in Indonesia\u2019s \nlegal framework and judicial process, and the adverse impact this has on investor confidence. \nGovernment actions and the Indonesian supreme court\u2019s decision to overturn the commercial court \ndeclaration  demonstrated  Indonesia\u2019s  commitment  to  act  against  corrupt  judicial  practices; \nhowever, the legal framework requires amendment to provide for supervisory authorization in filing \npetitions against insurance firms for bankruptcy or liquidation. This issue was raised in connection \nwith the Financial Governance Reforms: Sector Development Program (FGRSDP) third tranche \ndiscussions of progress in governance in Indonesia. It was discussed that the FGSSR program \nwould address this deficiency. \n \n ", "8   \nB.  Sector Issues \n \n1.  Inadequate Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision and Multiple Agency \nFramework \n     \n20.  Indonesia has suffered from historically weak regulatory implementation and a lack of \nsupervisory  resources  and  capacity  in  the  financial  sector.  The  effectiveness  of  agencies  in \ncarrying  out  their  roles  has  been  largely  undermined  by  weak  accountability  and  a  lack  of \nindependence. The multiple agency framework encompassing BI, Bapepam, and DGFI, lacks good \ngovernance, efficiency, and the resources and capacity to effectively enforce laws and regulations. \nAlthough the mandatory social insurance companies report data to the Insurance Directorate in \nDGFI, the Insurance Directorate does not supervise any of these mandatory programs\u2014they \nremain unsupervised in a regulatory framework. Indonesia is still in the process of building human \ncapital,  and  the  small  trained  cadre  of  professionals  has  been  dispersed  among  many \norganizations. Lack of resources is, in particular, a factor for DGFI; lack of independence affects \nDGFI and Bapepam; and weak accountability and poor governance are factors impacting all three \nagencies. In addition, the existing legal framework and multiple agency structure is not conducive \nto  the  supervision  of  companies  engaging  in  connected  lending.  Weak  coordination  and \ninformation sharing among the supervisory agencies have made it difficult to supervise and assess \nconsolidated risk exposure in the absence of harmonized prudential standards, financial reporting, \nor joint inspections programs. Although only a few Indonesian companies have succeeded in \noffering a broad range of financial services, banks may set up subsidiaries in insurance, securities \nbroking, or leasing. The potential remains for regulatory arbitrage and increasing risk exposure. \nImprovements have been made in the regulatory and supervisory frameworks across agencies \nover the past decade; however, changes have often come in a piecemeal fashion and have taken \na long time. Further improvements in the regulatory and supervisory framework could benefit from \na consolidated effort among agencies in lifting the level of supervision and good governance.    \n \n  2.  Lack of Anti-Money Laundering Regime \n \n21.  Indonesia\u2019s weak financial sector governance and supervision encompass frameworks for \nfighting money laundering. Until recently, money laundering was not a crime in Indonesia. Money \nlaundering also increases vulnerability to other kinds of crimes, such as drug trafficking, trafficking \nin people, fraud, and corruption. This vulnerability leads to poor governance, further undermining \nstate institutions and sound economic development. Indonesia was placed on the Financial Action \nTask Force on Money Laundering (FATF) list of Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories (NCCT) \nin June 2001 due to its lack of an anti-money laundering regime. It was classified in FATF\u2019s June \n2002 review to identify NCCTs as among the jurisdictions that have made progress in enacting \nlegislation to address deficiencies following its adoption of an anti-money laundering law. Further \nimprovements are, however, required to avoid imposition of FATF countermeasures that could \nseverely impact Indonesia\u2019s progress in recovery. Key issues have been identified, including a high \nrupiah  threshold  for  reporting  suspicious  transactions  and  a  14-day  period  before  suspicious \ntransactions must be reported. The law allows up to 1 year following enactment of the law to \nappoint the Chairman and deputies of the financial intelligence unit, and an additional 6 months to \nstart implementing functions. In October 2002, the President appointed the Chairman and Vice \nChairman of PPATK11 indicating key progress in this area, however, additional staff are required to \nmake  PPATK  operational.  ADB  is  providing  a  TA  to  support  development  of  an  anti-money \n                                                 \n11  Presidential Decree No. 201/2002 dated 8 October 2002. ", "  9\nlaundering regime,12 and is coordinating closely with other agencies in this area including the \nAustralian  Agency  for  International  Development,  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment,  Department  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  International \nMonetary Fund, World Bank, United Nations, and Asia-Europe Meeting Anti-Money Laundering \nInitiative (ASEM). Discussion of ADB\u2019s TA is included under the proposed program.  \n \n3.   Need  for  Advancement  of  Sector  Reforms  in  Transition  to  the  Financial \nServices Authority \n \n22.  The  Government  is  committed  to  moving  toward  the  establishment  of  a  consolidated \nregulatory and supervisory authority for financial services (OJK) to strengthen regulatory and \nsupervisory frameworks and more efficiently utilize regulatory resources. However, this process of \ntransition is projected to span a period of 18\u201324 months, and it is important to continue to advance \nsector reforms for the long-term strength and stability of the financial system. In this regard, BI, \nBapepam, and DGFI will need to continue to implement measures to improve supervision and \nenforcement of appropriate prudential safeguards and standards. Areas to be addressed include \nlicensing, qualifications for experts, procedures for onsite and offsite examinations, training for \nsupervisors and examiners, implementation of RBC requirements, and adoption of a risk-based \nregulatory approach. Full conversion to a scripless trading and settlement, adoption of measures \nfor an early warning system, and prompt revocation of licenses of broker-dealer companies not in \ncompliance with RBC and reporting requirements are among key required actions. \n \n23.  The  recent  government  announcement  of  insurance  sector  insolvencies  and  the  large \nnumber of unsound firms placed under DGFI surveillance raise questions on the viability of the \nsector. Major industry consolidation is anticipated, and some analysts have projected a reduction in \nthe number of companies to as few as 20 firms.13 The closure of firms and consolidation raise \nquestions as to the adequacy of consumer protection and the impact on employment. Although the \nConsumer Protection Law mandates establishment of an agency and disputes resolution body, \nneither has yet been established and it is unclear when these will be in operation and how they will \nbe engaged in the financial sector. Policyholders are currently unprotected. An evaluation of the \nimpact on employment of rapid industry consolidation has not yet been undertaken. There are over \n100,000 workers in the insurance sector.14 The Government believes that the new Rp100 billion \ncapital requirement for new entrants to the insurance sector will provide an adequate level of \ncapital for new businesses and will also serve as a barrier to entry for firms with inadequate \nresources. What remains a central issue is how to manage the existing firms now to avoid major \nmarket disruption and to minimize losses among policyholders. One major life insurer alone has a \ncapital deficiency of over $500 million. The Insurance Directorate has proposed a possible new \ninsurance guarantee institution for life insurance customers in 2004; however, such an institution \ncould only be effectively established after financial health has been restored to the sector and, \nbased on recent data, this would likely be beyond 2004. In the meantime, plans for restructuring \nand/or mergers need to be urgently developed. There is also a need to train actuaries and develop \nthe actuarial profession in Indonesia to increase their number as well as the capacity and skills \nrequired to support the insurance industry, as it comes into line with international best practices. \n \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2002.

Inadequate National Social Security \n \n24.  Improving  governance  and  supervisory  frameworks  for  pensions  and  insurance  are \nfundamental first steps in strengthening the social security system. However, significant reforms \nwill be required to provide adequate retirement income. There is no unified policy, supervisory, \nregulatory, or legal framework for the pension sector or social security. Multiple ministries are \ninvolved in the control and regulation of pension programs. Mandatory programs target formal \nsector workers exclusively, leaving the majority of the working population uncovered, and there is \nno first pillar providing a minimum pension. Fiscal sustainability of the mandatory programs of \nTaspen and Asabri is also a critical issue as unfunded pension liabilities are presently estimated at \nRp380.3 trillion. Future funding problems are inevitable as unfunded liabilities mount under the \ncurrent pay-as-you-go basis, and the Government is reluctant to take the necessary measures to \nincrease funding in view of its current immense debt burden. \n \n25.  In 2002, the President established a team to lead the policy development of national social \nsecurity. This team has been given a mandate to prepare a new national law addressing social \nsecurity  in  2002.15  However,  additional  resources  and  assistance  are  needed  to  meet  these \nambitious goals. Key issues in the present system include (i) insufficient governance of mandatory \npension  and  provident  funds,  (ii) lack  of  fiscal  sustainability  of  mandatory  pension  programs, \n(iii) inadequate  retirement  incomes  for  formal  sector  workers  and  limited  coverage  of  the \npopulation, (iv) lack of a unified national identification system for administering social security and \nfacilitate portability, and (v) no unified social security framework or law. For Jamsostek (a defined \ncontribution plan), the primary concern is that the plan does not provide sufficient retirement \nincome,  potentially  burdening  the  Government  in  years  ahead.  Encouraging  competition  and \neliminating state monopolies will be important factors in strengthening the social security system. \nGradual reduction or elimination of the option for one-off lump-sum benefits at retirement is also \nimportant. Taking lump-sum benefits, a common practice in Indonesia, leaves room for myopic \nspending by retirees with that could significantly reduce or eliminate retirement savings. Additional \nconcerns include low wage replacement ratio, underreporting of wages, lack of enforcement, lack \nof a common national identification number, lack of governance, and lack of government-directed \ninvestment. Inadequate management information systems also make it more difficult to address \nproblems  related  to  underreporting  or  misallocation  of  contributions.  Under  the  PT  corporate \nstructure,16 the mandatory schemes are required to operate on a profit-seeking basis and to pay \ndividends and taxes to the Government (the only shareholder). This further diminishes members\u2019 \ninvestments and strengthens the impression that the state schemes are an additional form of \ntaxation. Profit for owners is not generally accepted to be an appropriate objective for insurance \nprovided on a monopoly and mandatory basis. Surpluses should be applied to the benefit of those \ninsured. Reforms under the FGSSR will focus on the pension and provident funds components of \nthe social insurance companies.17  \n \n5.  Poor Corporate Governance  \n \n26.  Indonesia's corporate and commercial system is not working under a robust system of \ncorporate governance. Existing rules and regulations have not been rigorously enforced. External \nmechanisms and enforcement through banks and capital markets, which are a feature of corporate \ndiscipline in other countries, have not functioned well. There has been little incentive for internal \n                                                 \n15  ADB provided support to a delegation from the presidential team to establish a national social insurance system in \nManila in June 2002, in connection with preparatory work for establishing a national social insurance law. \n16  The Indonesian equivalent of the incorporated limited liability company is the perseroan terbatas or PT. \n17  Health, accident and other insurance are not planned to be addressed under the FGSSR given the need to maintain a \nmore focused program. ", " 11\nmechanisms or voluntary best practices to be adopted. Essential legislation establishing adequate \nauditors\u2019 liability for audits and commissioners\u2019 liability for misleading or false public information \nand board decisions needs to be put in place. Comprehensive disclosure in corporate reporting, \nindependent directors or commissioners safeguarding the rights of minority shareholders, and \ntransparency  in  financial  dealings  with  related  parties  are  still  lacking.  Stock  exchanges  in \nIndonesia are required to be in the mutual form, limiting trading access to members. The option to \ndemutualize should be allowed by law and promoted to separate ownership from trading access to \nimprove corporate governance and provide a framework for eliminating conflicts of interest and \nraising the necessary capital for development and growth.  \n \nC.  Lessons Learned from Asian Development Bank Operations in the Sector \n \n27.  ADB has had major financial sector operations in Indonesia addressing banking, capital \nmarkets, pensions, and insurance for over 15 years. Three major program loans undertaken during \nthis  time  are  the  Financial  Sector  Program,  for  $200 million,  approved  in  1988;  the  Second \nFinancial  Sector  Program,  for  $250 million,  approved  in  1992;  and  the  Financial  Governance \nReforms Sector Development Program, for $1.4 billion, approved in 1998. The thrust of financial \nsector reforms over this period moved from a focus on deregulation of the banking sector and \ncapital markets as a means of increasing competition, efficiencies, growth, and diversification of \nthe financial system to a period of implementation of a comprehensive set of reforms aimed at \nstrengthening potential safeguards while encouraging market forces and market efficiency. The \nrapid dramatic growth that occurred following deregulation, and the subsequent problems from \nderegulation, highlighted inadequacies in the legal, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks. Basic \nlaws for the operation of insurance companies and pension funds were approved in 1991 and 1992 \nand Bapepam was divested in 1991 of its dual and conflicting responsibility of both regulating and \nmanaging the Jakarta Stock Exchange. Although basic legislative frameworks were established, \nregulatory and supervisory frameworks remained weak and enforcement was lax. The Asian crisis \nexposed  those  weaknesses,  and  subsequent  reforms  have  concentrated  on  strengthening \nregulation  and  supervision,  improving  corporate  governance,  and  adopting  international  best \npractices and standards for prudential regulation and supervision. Based upon ADB program \ncompletion reports and a special evaluation study,18 all of the noted programs were considered \nsuccessful, though not without difficulties and incomplete attainment of some reforms. Lessons \nrelevant to this program learned from prior programs include: \n \n(i)  More time was needed than envisaged to meet some of the targets, particularly in \nthe area of legislative reform. This reality should be factored into future program designs; \n \n(ii)  Effective loan designs require not only an understanding of the sector, but also of \nthe overall policy environment and the macroeconomic and structural forces at work; \n \n(iii)  Programs concentrating on deregulation need to ensure that adequate supervisory \nand  regulatory  frameworks  are  in  place  to  prevent  subsequent  sector  weakening  or \ncollapse; \n \n(iv)  Programs  are  often  only  one  phase  of  a  continuing  process  of  reforms  and \nadjustments. Further measures are often necessary to ensure that the gains from the \nprograms are consolidated and retained; \n \n                                                 \n18  ADB.  2001.

THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n \n28.  The FGSSR will build upon core reforms in Loan 1618: Financial Governance Reforms \nSector  Development  Program,19  by  refocusing  on  improving  governance  through  increased \ndisclosure,  transparency,  and  enforcement  of  regulations;  audit  of  enterprises;  and  the \ndevelopment of legal frameworks for anticorruption and anti-money laundering efforts. Phase I will \nsupport a broad framework for the overall strengthening of the financial sector and promote the \ndevelopment of sound financial institutions necessary to support good governance and economic \ngrowth. It also aims to improve social protection through improved governance, supervision, and \nregulation of pension funds and mandatory social insurance programs. Sustainable economic \ndevelopment and growth in Indonesia depend on strengthening governance, financial supervision, \nand regulation. Robust economic growth can help the country create jobs, raise standards of living, \nand reduce poverty. \n \n29.  To  promote  consistency,  efficiency,  and  harmonization  of  supervision  across  financial \nservices and products, Phase I will support the establishment of Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK), a \nconsolidated regulatory and supervisory authority for financial services. In the pre-OJK transition \nperiod of 2002\u20132003, Phase I will (i) support comprehensive legal reform necessary to transfer \nauthorities to OJK; (ii) support development of an anti-money laundering regime; (iii) continue \nstrengthening  regulation  and  supervision  in  the  relevant  institutions;  (iv) improve  corporate \ngovernance;  (v) promote  adoption  of  international  best  practices  and  standards  for  prudential \nregulation and supervision; and (vi) strengthen the soundness of financial institutions. \n \n30.   To improve national social security, Phase I will (i) bring the entities related to mandatory \nsocial insurance and social security programs under OJK\u2019s jurisdiction; (ii) improve governance of \nmandatory pension and provident funds; (iii) undertake measures to improve fiscal sustainability of \nmandatory programs including assessment of unfunded pension liabilities and preparation of plans \nto  reduce  liabilities  and  operating  costs;  (iv) support  improvements  to  programs  to  provide \nadequate retirement income; (v) support development of a unified identification system for national \nsocial security to improve administration and portability of benefits; (vi) assess potential options for \nexpanding coverage of the social security system to the informal sector; (vii) develop a new law \nand agency for national social security; and (viii) undertake a strategic audit, company valuations, \nand reviews to identify necessary reforms and restructuring. Phase II would continue support for \nPhase I reforms, and include measures to support broader social security reform, restructuring, \nand consolidation of enterprises as needed. Appendix 2 is the development policy letter of the \nGovernment on the envisaged sector reforms, together with the policy matrix. Appendix 3 provides \nthe program framework. \n \n                                                 \n19  ADB. 1998.

", " 13\nB.  Policy Framework and Actions for Phase I 20  \n \n1.  Strengthen Frameworks for Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision \nthrough Consolidation of Regulatory and Supervisory Authorities  \n \n31.   To improve governance and to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory frameworks in the \nfinancial sector, Law No. 23 of 1999 concerning Bank Indonesia mandated the establishment of a \nconsolidated supervisory authority for financial services. The passage of this central bank law was \na condition under FGRSDP. In line with this mandate, the Government will establish OJK, the \nplanned consolidated regulatory and supervisory authority, with the support of two ADB TAs.21 To \neffectively  improve  such  regulation  and  supervision,  essential  levels  of  accountability  and \nindependence of OJK must be maintained by law. It is in this respect \u2013 the achievement of a higher \nlevel of accountability and independence \u2013 that OJK can offer a fundamental and significant \nchange in the regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector. OJK\u2019s mandate for \nconsumer protection in the financial sector will also be supported. OJK is also important in that a \nconsolidated  regulatory  and  supervisory  authority  will  (i)  provide  a  structure  that  can  more \neffectively utilize the scarce regulatory resources and skilled staff in Indonesia; and (ii) promote \nconsistency and harmonization across financial services and products (i.e. regulatory neutrality).  \n \n32.  The development of OJK also provides a critical opportunity to improve the quality of \nsupervision of specific sectors. Sector reforms can be accelerated through a coordinated effort \namong supervisory agencies for adoption and amendment of relevant sector laws and through the \ndevelopment of the OJK framework. One example of an important reform with respect to the \ninsurance sector, is the requirement for written authorization from OJK for filing petitions for \nbankruptcy or liquidation (see discussion in para. 19).   \n \n33.  Under Phase I, the draft OJK law will be prepared with ADB assistance, lodged with the \nState Secretary Office and submitted by the President to Parliament for enactment. To ensure \neffective transfer of authority to OJK, the Government will support all necessary amendments to \nexisting  legislation.  To  enable  effective  operations  of  OJK,  the  Government  will  support  the \npreparation of comprehensive legislation and implementing rules and regulations that adequately \ndefine OJK\u2019s role, functions, powers, responsibilities, appropriate governance and organizational \nstructure, policy and terms for staff, and capacity-building and training needs. The Government will \nprovide budgetary support to enable OJK to make transitional arrangements to begin operations \nand integrate operations within one or two years of enactment of the law. OJK\u2019s purview will \ninclude banking, capital markets, pensions, insurance, and other financial services companies. \nOJK  will  also  have  jurisdiction  over  social  insurance  and  social  security  programs  including \nJamsostek, Taspen, and Asabri as described in paras. 38\u201339. To promote greater transparency, \naccountability, disclosure, and compliance, OJK will adopt and promote best practices in corporate \ngovernance and international standards for prudential regulation and supervision.  \n \n34.  The emergence of a single agency with integrated regulatory and supervisory powers over \ndifferent types of financial institutions first gained recognition in the 1980s in northern Europe in \nresponse to banking crises. There has been an increasing interest and adoption of this approach in \nother  regions  including  Asia.  The  institutional  responsibilities  and  powers  have  varied  across \nregulatory models, and the motivations for moving toward regulatory integration have ranged, with \nefficient  use  of  regulatory  resources,  regulatory  neutrality,  and  the  opportunity  to  improve \n                                                 \n20  See policy matrix in Appendix 2. \n21  ADB.  2001.

Appendix 1 includes additional summary \ninformation on consolidated regulatory and supervisory authorities, and provides a comparison of \nregulatory responsibilities and powers among nine integrated regulators.  \n \n2.  Establish an Effective Anti-Money Laundering Regime \n \n35.  Under the FGRSDP, an anti-money laundering law was developed and signed by the \nPresident in 2002. The FGSSR will provide further support to accelerate reforms and establish an \neffective anti-money laundering regime. This assistance will be provided in close coordination with \nother  agencies  (see  para.  21).  The  Government  will  continue  to  place  priority  on  taking  the \nnecessary measures to address deficiencies in its anti-money laundering regime as identified by \nFATF until Indonesia is removed from the NCCT list. The Government will adopt and amend as \nnecessary the anti-money law, and issue regulations and guidelines, and provide the necessary \nframeworks for institutions to support implementation of the new law. In support of this regime, \nsector decrees will also be issued including \u201cKnow Your Customer Principles\u201d by BI and Bapepam \nfor banks and securities markets respectively. Adequate budgetary support will be provided to \nenable set-up and operations of the financial intelligence unit (PPATK) mandated under the law. To \nfacilitate  the  start  of  operations  of  PPATK,  the  President  appointed  the  Chairman  and  Vice \nChairman of PPATK in October 2002 and BI is planning the appointment/secondment of additional \nstaff to PPATK on an interim basis. Additional staff will be key to ensuring operational capacity of \nPPATK, and a Presidential Decree will be issued on the organizational structure and operations of \nPPATK. \n \n36.  BI will assume financial intelligence unit functions for the banking sector until PPATK is \noperational, and will provide interim reports on monitoring of suspicious transactions. Systems for \nsuspicious transactions reporting and analysis will be developed and guidance notes issued for \nthose institutions subject to the anti-money laundering law for reporting suspicious transactions. \nCapacity building and training will be conducted for PPATK, related financial institutions, the \njudiciary, law enforcement officers, and prosecutors. Workshops will be held in Jakarta and major \nprovinces to increase awareness of money laundering as a crime and understanding of the new \nlaw. PPATK will issue semiannual reports on its work to the President, Parliament, and related \nagencies. PPATK will undertake all necessary measures to enter into operational memorandum of \nunderstandings with other relevant Government agencies and institutions, and begin dialogue to \nenter into information-sharing and cooperation arrangements with regulatory institutions in the Asia \nand Pacific region.  \n   \n3.   Advance Core Sector Reforms in Transition to OJK \n \n37.  During the transition to OJK, core sector reforms will be advanced over the transition period \nof 2002\u20132004. These reforms build upon initial actions taken under FGRSDP and fall broadly into \nthe following categories: \n \n(i)  strengthen supervision and regulation; \n(ii)  promote adoption of international best practices and standards; \n(iii)  strengthen capital base and implement RBC standards; and \n(iv)  provide institutional capacity building and public education. \n \n38.  DGFI and Bapepam will continue to improve enforcement efforts and raise standards, \nincluding actions to implement the risk-based prudential standards for insurance companies and \nstrengthen and simplify escalation procedures for dealing with problem companies; issue time-\nbound warnings to brokers not in compliance with existing rules and regulations; and develop \nstandards for qualifications and licensing requirements for fund managers, insurance specialists ", " 15\nand companies, agents, and brokers in line with international best practices. Amendments to \naccounting, insurance, pension, company and capital market laws will be undertaken both to \nstrengthen supervision and regulation and provide for international best practices and standards. \nDGFI  and  Bapepam  will  continue  to  develop  criteria  and  issue  legislation  with  regard  to \nindependent directors, commissioners, and auditors, as well as liability for their actions. Increased \nsanctions for noncompliance and higher levels of enforcement will also be undertaken. Guidelines \nand standards for onsite and offsite examinations will be developed as well as software systems to \nsupport  effective  examination.  Bapepam  and  DGFI  will  improve  prudential  supervision  and \nregulation  by  enforcing  provisions  requiring  greater  transparency  in  operations.  To  build \ninstitutional capacity, Bapepam and DGFI will promote human resources development through \ncore training. \n \n39.  To  improve  market  efficiencies  and  increase  capacity  to  support  economic  growth, \nBapepam  will  monitor  the  move  to  a  fully  scripless  trading  system  in  2002  with  appropriate \noperational clearance and settlement, central depository systems, and bank settlement systems. \nTo ensure sound capital market operations, all firms that are members of the Indonesian Clearing \nand Guarantee Corporation, that extend margins, or that keep custody of customer securities will \nmaintain Rp5 billion net adjusted working capital, and all fund managers will be licensed to meet \nongoing  requirements.  Bapepam  will  also  introduce  stringent  procedures  to  enforce  RBC \nrequirements on a consistent and transparent basis. DGFI and Bapepam will also continue to \nsupport professional and company associations to improve qualification standards in line with \ninternational best practices. \n \n40.  To  promote  accountability  and  increase  consumer  protection,  DGFI  issued  a  decree \nrequiring insurance companies to publicly disclose solvency positions, names of company owners \nand  board  of  directors  and  commissioners.  To  determine  the  potential  systemic  risk  in  the \ninsurance  sector,  a  strategic  assessment  will  be  undertaken  by  the  Insurance  Directorate  to \ndetermine  the  financial  condition  of  insurance  companies,  and  strategic  options  including \nrestructuring, consolidation, or closure. High priority, at-risk insurance firms will be targeted by the \nInsurance Directorate for immediate action. The Government will establish a plan for the insurance \nsector for an orderly market transition, including possible assistance. ADB will provide TA to \nsupport this action (see para. 61). The insurance industry will be required to comply with the \nincreasing RBC requirements in line with the staged escalation to 2004, and to seek appropriate \nmerger  partners  if  they  are  unable  to  independently  increase  capital  to  required  levels.  The \nGovernment  will  enforce  sanctions,  including  suspension  of  licenses,  against  firms  not  in \ncompliance. \n \n4.  Improve National Social Security \n \n41.  Improving  financial  sector  governance  and  regulatory  and  supervisory  frameworks  for \npensions and insurance are fundamental first steps to strengthening social security. However, \nsignificant reforms will be required to provide adequate retirement income. Phase I will concentrate \non improving social security in the following areas: \n \n(i)  entities related to mandatory social insurance or social security programs will come \nunder the jurisdiction of OJK and be subject to OJK\u2019s regulatory and supervisory authority; \n \n(ii)  a new law for national social security will be developed to unify programs and \nimprove social security frameworks, management, and administration; \n \n(iii)  governance of mandatory pension and retirement schemes will be improved; \n \n ", "16   \n(iv)  the financial condition, operations, and fiscal sustainability of mandatory programs \nwill be assessed, and options developed for restructuring and reducing unfunded pension \nliabilities; \n \n(v)  the management of voluntary pension plans will be improved through certification \nrequirements for private pension fund managers and licensing requirements; and \n \n(vi)  proposals  for  a  realistic  scope  of  expansion  of  social  security  systems  to  the \ninformal sector in the near and medium term will be examined.  \n \n42.   The Government will conduct an independent special audit of Jamsostek including an audit \nof the investment portfolio and company assets, a current fair market valuation of the assets, and \nan assessment of inadequacies and potential problems of the mandatory program for formal \nprivate sector workers and SOEs. As Jamsostek is a defined contribution plan (savings scheme) it \ndoes not have the problem of unfunded pension liabilities. Problems to be addressed include lack \nof transparency and public disclosure, weak internal corporate governance structures, historical \ndirected investments under political pressure, poor returns, high operating costs, segregation of \nassets,  and  cross-subsidization  of  programs.  Options  and  recommendations  for  improving \ngovernance  and  operations  will  be  developed,  including  restructuring  and  elimination  of \nmonopolies. Taspen will assess the unfunded pension liabilities of its mandatory pension plans for \ncivil servants and prepare options to reduce unfunded liabilities (accumulated liabilities in the pay-\nas-you-go system from existing debt from past service has been assessed at Rp342 trillion for \nTaspen).22  Regular  independent  actuarial  assessments  of  unfunded  liabilities  of  mandatory \nprograms  will  be  supported.  To  provide  efficient  administration  of  benefits  and  to  allow  for \nportability of benefits, the Government will develop a unified identification system for national social \nsecurity. To provide adequate stakeholder inputs into the development of such a system, a series \nof public seminars and workshops will be conducted among stakeholder groups, and a public \neducation campaign will be conducted to inform the public of social security system and reform \nissues. \n \n5.  Strengthen Corporate Governance \n \n43.  The Government will take actions to improve governance in the corporate and commercial \nsystem in Indonesia in line with FGRSDP requirements and the FGSSR objectives. This includes \nenforcing  existing  rules  and  regulations,  issuing  new  legislation,  and  increasing  sanctions. \nLegislation will be prepared to establish significant liability of auditors for negligence and liability of \ncommissioners  for  misleading  or  false  public  information  and  board  decisions.  A  draft  public \naccountants law will be expanded to include adequate provisions for liability for auditors23 for \nnegligence, to be submitted to the State Secretary Office in 2003. As an interim measure, the \nMinistry  of  Finance  issued  a  decree  for  Public  Accountants  in  September  200224  including \nprovisions establishing liability of auditors for negligence and expanding the scope of coverage to \ninclude financial audits, performance audits, and special audits.  \n \n44.  The Ministry of Justice and Human Rights (MOJHR) will expand draft amendments to the \nCompany Law of 1995 to include provisions for liability for commissioners and directors for false \nand misleading public information and board decisions. In Indonesia, the Board of Commissioners \n                                                 \n22  ADB. 1998.

To address \nthis  two-board  system  and  to  further  expand  the  legislative  scope  for  imposing  liability  on \nmanagement  with  a  view  to  strengthening  corporate  governance,  the  FGSSR  has  expanded \nFGRSDP conditionality to apply to both Boards of Commissioners and Boards of Directors.26 The \ndraft Company Law will be submitted with the draft OJK law in a package of laws for consideration \nby Parliament in 2003. As an interim measure, Bapepam will exercise its regulatory power by \nimposing sanctions as applicable to boards of commissioners and directors of listed companies. \nThe Government will submit laws as a package to facilitate coordination of multiple legislative \nreforms in the financial sector, streamline the process in Parliament and provide an integrated \napproach to support the establishment of OJK.27 \n  \n45.  Additional measures by Bapepam include preparation of a rule in 2002 on independence of \naccountants providing audit services in the capital market to be issued by year-end. Bapepam will \nalso amend the Capital Market Law including provisions to (i) establish liability for directors in \nviolation  of  the  Capital  Market  Law;  (ii) establish  responsibility  of  lawyers  involved  in  the \npreparation  of  legal  audit  for  reporting  violations  of  the  Capital  Market  Law;  and  (iii) allow \ndemutualization of stock exchanges. The draft Capital Market Law will be submitted with the \npackage of laws with OJK. \n \n6.  Phase Two \n \n46.  Phase II is anticipated to be $150 million, and will continue support for Phase I reforms and \ninclude  measures  to  support  broader  and  deeper  social  security  reform  and  restructuring  as \nneeded.  Reforms  are  outlined  in  the  policy  matrix.  Phase  II  will  be  presented  for  Board \nconsideration, based on the progress of implementation of Phase I. Policy actions for Phase II are \nsubject to revision depending upon ADB\u2019s reassessment of the macroeconomic environment, \nfurther sector information and analyses conducted under Phase I, lessons learned during Phase I, \nand status of implementation and readiness of the Government to undertake the proposed policy \nreform actions. \n \nC.   The Loan \n \n1.  Amount of Phase I Loan and Source of Funds \n \n47.  A $250 million program loan is proposed from ADB's ordinary capital resources to support \nPhase I as described in the attached development policy letter and the policy matrix. The Borrower \nwill be the Republic of Indonesia. The loan will be utilized over a period of 12 months from the date \nof its effectiveness. The loan size has been determined by the complexity of the program, the \nprogram\u2019s development impact, the importance of the sector, and the potential adjustment costs \nrelated to the structural reforms. The estimated costs of reforms under Phase I are: \n \n(i)  costs to establish OJK (the consolidated regulatory and supervisory authority for \nfinancial  services),  including  capacity  building  and  retrenchment/redeployment \n($22.0 million) (Supplementary Appendix); \n \n                                                 \n25  Equivalent to Board of Directors in some countries. \n26  FGRSDP conditionality pertained to liability only at the commissioner level. \n27  ADB has supported this approach as a practical matter, given the large number of bills to be considered in Parliament  \nand the desirability of an ambitious and coherent approach to amending legislation governing regulatory institutions. \n ", "18   \n(ii)  costs  to  establish  PPATK  (the  financial  intelligence  unit  for  the  anti-money \nlaundering regime), capacity building for PPATK and related government institutions, and \nsupport for the regulatory compliance costs associated with the new anti-money laundering \nlaw ($25 million);28 and \n \n(iii)  costs relating to restructuring the insurance sector ($200 million). \n \n48.  The adjustment costs to the economy could significantly exceed the amount of the program \nloan. The capital deficiency of one troubled life insurer alone is in excess of $500 million, and other \nfirms have been identified as financially weak or unsound.  \n \n2.  Interest, Maturity, and Utilization Period \n \n49.  The Phase I loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum; a front-end fee of 1%; conversion options that \nmay be exercised in accordance with the terms of the draft Loan Agreement, the loan regulations, \nand ADB\u2019s conversion guidelines; and other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan \nAgreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) reasons for Indonesia\u2019s decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any \ncommunication or advice of ADB. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Procurement and Disbursements \n \n50.  Upon loan effectiveness, ADB will have the right to withdraw from the loan account and pay \nitself, on behalf of the Government, the front-end fee charged on the loan in the amount of \n$2.5 million.  The  proceeds  of  the  balance  of  the  loan  will  be  utilized  to  finance  the  foreign \nexchange  costs  of  items  produced  in,  and  procured  from,  ADB\u2019s  member  countries.  The \nGovernment will certify that, if (i) the proceeds of the loan will finance imports already made, the \nvalue of eligible imports in the period concerned exceeds the amount of the requested withdrawal; \nor (ii) the loan proceeds are to finance goods to be imported, the value of eligible imports in the \nimmediately  preceding  year  period  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  requested \ndisbursement  plus  all  other  amounts  expected  to  be  withdrawn  from  the  loan  during  the \nsucceeding 1 year. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the \naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n2.  Counterpart Funds \n \n51.  The policy matrix for Phase I includes specific components that bear distinct costs of \nstructural  adjustments  (Appendix  2).  The  counterpart  funds  to  be  generated  out  of  the  loan \nproceeds will be used by the Government to finance the cost of such structural adjustments, as \nwell as other activities consistent with the program. \n \n                                                 \n28  As reference, the compliance cost assessment for the United Kingdom in the Money Laundering Regulations 1993 \nExplanatory Note estimated initial compliance costs at \u00a330 million. Although the larger institutions should be able to \nabsorb  compliance  costs,  smaller  institutions  may  need  some  initial  support  from  the  Government  for  timely \nimplementation. Government support is to be repaid by institutions.  ", " 19\n3.  Monitoring and Tranching \n \n52.  The first loan of the FGSSR is to be released in three tranches. The first tranche equivalent \nto  $100 million  will  be  made  available  upon  the  Government  meeting  conditions  of  loan \neffectiveness. An additional incentive tranche of $50 million and the second tranche of $100 million \nwill be released upon satisfactory compliance with agreed upon conditions. The second tranche is \nexpected  to  be  released  within  eights  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  progress  of \nimplementation of specified policy actions set out in the policy matrix (Appendix 2) will be reviewed \nby ADB with the Government on an ongoing basis with respect to the incentive tranche, and about \n3 months prior to the scheduled second tranche release. \n \n53.

CMEA will act as the Executing Agency for the FGSSR to facilitate (i)  the necessary \ncoordination  across  multiple  implementing  agencies  for  implementation  of  reforms  and  (ii) a \nsmooth transition from Phase I to Phase II as regulatory and supervisory powers are transferred \nfrom existing authorities to OJK. A program director will head the program implementation unit. \nMeasures are being undertaken to ensure program readiness. Implementing agencies will be \nprimarily responsible to carry out the program. \n \n \n ", "22   \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n59.  The TA will support (i) insurance sector restructuring and (ii) the development of a national \nsocial security system. \n \nB.  Scope \n \n60.  The scope of the TA is divided into the following two components. \n \n1.  Insurance Sector Restructuring \n \n61.  An international insurance sector expert and/or senior insurance regulators with experience \nin insurance sector restructuring and familiarity with the insurance sector in Indonesia will work with \nthe  Government  to  assess  the  financial  condition  of  the  sector,  and  determine  options  for \nrestructuring and consolidation, along with the level and type of government support needed to \nimplement recommended options. The expert/senior regulator will also facilitate industry dialogue \nand input as necessary, and provide a realistic timebound plan for sector restructuring over the \n2003-2005 period. \n \n2.  Development of a National Social Security System  \n \n62.  This component will provide assistance for the development of national social security in \nline  with  key  policies  and  priorities  established  by  the  Presidential  Team  for  National  Social \nSecurity and other agencies. This component will: \n  \n(i)  conduct  a  feasibility  study  for  social  security  reform  which  will  provide,  among \nothers: (a) options for restructuring existing public social insurance schemes to improve \ngovernance and programs; (b) recommendations for contribution rates and other factors to \nimprove retirement income under existing and proposed schemes; and (c) proposals for a \nrealistic scope of expansion of social security systems to the informal sector in the near and \nmedium term, and potential sequencing of reforms given existing constraints; \n \n(ii)  conduct a series of stakeholder consultations through public workshops to provide \ninputs from stakeholders for formulation of a national social security system; \n \n(iii)  assist in the preparation of legislation and regulations for a new law for a national \nsocial security system;  \n \n(iv)  support development of a unified identification system for national social security to \nimprove social security administration and management; \n \n(v)  support a public education campaign on social security and socialization of the new \ndraft law on national social security through a range of media and public workshops and \nseminars;  \n \n(vi)  provide  training  for  key  officials  in  core  concepts  of  social  security  system \nmanagement, administration, and governance; and \n \n(vii)  support  development  of  the  actuarial  profession  by  identifying  and  assessing \noptions and incentives necessary to increase the number and qualifications of actuaries.

The combined cost of this TA is estimated at $1,250,000 equivalent, comprising $705,000 \nin foreign exchange and $545,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will provide $1,000,000 \nequivalent to cover the foreign exchange cost of $705,000 and part of the local currency cost \nequivalent to $295,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB's TA funding program. \nThe Government will provide the balance in local currency cost as in-kind provision of experienced \ncounterpart staff, office space, information and data collection, and communications. The detailed \ncost estimates and financing arrangements are provided in Appendix 4. \n \n64.  CMEA, as the Executing Agency, will coordinate the TA. It will provide the necessary \nqualified counterpart staff, office space, and secretarial and related services for the consultants. A \nsenior official will be appointed to serve as the TA project manager. The implementing agencies \nwill include DGFI, Ministry of Manpower and Transmigration, and other relevant agencies. \n \n65.  The TA will be implemented over a 12-month period and is planned to commence by March \n2003 and to be completed by March 2004. Consulting services will include (i) 22 person-months of \ninternational consultants with expertise in the insurance industry including restructuring, company \nvaluations, and financial analysis; social security development; legislative reform; public education; \nand identification and administration systems for social security; and (ii) 31 person-months of local \nconsultants with expertise in social security, social development, public education, institutional and \nlegal  analysis,  public  administration,  and  the  actuarial  profession  to  facilitate  research, \nconsultation, and public education. The consultants will be recruited individually in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  using  the  biodata  proposal  procedure  and/or \nsimplified  technical  proposal  procedures.  Appendix  5  provides  the  terms  of  reference  of  the \nconsultants. All equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n \nVI.   PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits \n \n66.  Strengthening  the  governance  of  financial  markets  and  social  security  in  Phase  I  is \nexpected to have wide-ranging and sustained benefits including the following: \n \n(i)  The  primary  benefits  are  promoting  financial  soundness,  market  stability,  and \nrestoration  of  investor  confidence.  These  objectives  will  be  addressed  through  the \nimplementation  of  reforms  to  strengthen  regulation,  supervision,  and  governance \nframeworks,  with  the  potential  to  broaden  and  diversify  the  markets  and  encourage \ndomestic and foreign investment in Indonesia. Asset diversification away from the banking \nsector,  especially  given  continued  weakness  in  this  sector,  will  support  more  resilient \ndomestic  markets  able  to  withstand  exogenous  shocks  and  currency  contagion.  The \nestablishment of an effective anti-money laundering regime will also add to the stability of \nIndonesia\u2019s financial system, and reduce vulnerabilities to other types of crimes including \ndrug trafficking, trafficking in people, fraud, and corruption. \n  \n(ii)  Improved frameworks for effectively dealing with financial crises will also help the \neconomy protect vulnerable groups that fall below poverty lines during a crisis, as currency \ndepreciation triggers unemployment and impacts lower income levels disproportionately. \n \n ", "24   \n(iii)  Other major benefits include increased protection of consumers, policyholders, and \nworkers  and  more  transparent,  sustainable,  social  insurance  programs  with  improved \ngovernance, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks that can provide better social security \nand reduce the potential for poverty in old age. The Summary Poverty Reduction and Social \nStrategy and the Poverty Impact Assessment are in Appendix 6. The FGSSR is considered \nto be environmentally neutral and an environmental impact assessment is in Appendix 7. \n \n(iv)  An additional benefit is that the FGSSR provides an essential platform to carry \nforward the FGRSDP agenda.  \n \nB.  Risks \n \n67.  The implementation of Phase I could be affected by various factors: \n \n(i)  The  principal  risk  relates  to  the  potential  for  continuing  or  escalating  political \nuncertainty,  civil  conflict  or  unrest,  and  their  effect  on  the  pace  of  structural  reforms. \nHowever, there is a firm commitment to financial governance and social security reform at \nthe highest levels of Government and consequently the risk of the FGSSR being diluted or \nabandoned is reduced; \n \n(ii)  The  other  main  risk  stems  from  resistance  by  vested  interests  to  the  reforms, \nparticularly  since  Phase  I  covers  sensitive  areas,  such  as  social  security  reform, \nrestructuring consolidation of the insurance industry, and development of an anti-money \nlaundering regime. The Government has been gradually overcoming resistance in these \nareas through public information campaigns and socialization of reforms through seminars \nand workshops; and \n \n(iii)  Delays may also occur in the implementation of reforms due to lack of capacity. The \nGovernment has identified areas where it will require assistance. \n \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n \n68.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The policies adopted and measures taken before the date of the Loan Agreement \nas described in the development policy letter and the policy matrix will continue in effect as \nnecessary; \n \n(ii)  The Government will adopt the other policies and actions included in the FGSSR \nand specified in the development policy letter and the policy matrix in a timely manner and \nwill ensure that the policies and measures will continue in effect as necessary; \n \n(iii)  The Government will undertake up-front policy reforms by implementing some of the \npolicy measures envisaged under the second loan, whenever it deems it feasible; \n \n(iv)  The Government will provide ADB with the opportunity to comment on relevant \nstudies  and  draft  regulations  that  are  likely  to  impact  on  program  objectives  and \nimplementation; \n ", " 25\n(v)  The Government will ensure that adequate and timely funds are made available to \nthe relevant implementing agencies to facilitate implementation of the FGSSR; and \n \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that counterpart funds will be used to support the \nfinancial sector and the reforms to be implemented under the FGSSR. \n \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n69.  I am satisfied that the proposed program cluster concept and loan would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of ADB and recommend that the Board approve: \n   \n(i)  the  program  cluster  concept  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Social  Security \nReform Program to the Republic of Indonesia; and \n  \n(ii)  the loan of $250,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to the Republic of \nIndonesia for Phase I of the Financial Governance and Social Security Reform Program, \nwith a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years, and with interest to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n \n18 November 2002 \n \n ", " 26  Appendix 1 \nSECTOR/SUBSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Pension and Provident Funds \n \n1.  The  pension  system  in  Indonesia  targets  formal  sector  workers  exclusively,  is  not \nredistributive, and there is no \u201cfirst pillar\u201d providing basic social security pension coverage.1 \nApproximately  25 million  people  are  currently  covered  under  mandatory  programs  through \nstate-run monopolies, and there are an additional 1.0 million participants in voluntary pension \nschemes. The Indonesian social insurance system includes three mandatory programs covering \n(i) formal  private  sector  workers,  (ii) civil  servants,  and  (iii) the  armed  forces.  Jamsostek \n(Jaminan Sosial Tenaga Kerja) is not a pension scheme, but a mandatory savings scheme that \nprovides coverage for employees of private sector and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) with 10 \nor more employees or a monthly wage cost of at least Rp1 million. Taspen (Tabungan dan \nAsuransi Pegawai Negari) covers all civil servants and Asabri (Asuransi Social ABRI) covers \npolice,  and  civilian  and  military  defense  personnel.  These  mandatory  schemes  can  be \nsupplemented by voluntary pensions (dana pensiuns) of two types, employer pension funds \n(DPPKs) and financial institutions pension funds (DPLKs). A summary overview of pension \nprograms\u2019 membership, assets, liabilities, and cash flow is shown in Table 4 in the main text. \n \n2.  There is no unified policy, supervisory, regulatory, or legal framework for the pension \nsector or social security at present. Multiple ministries have been involved in the control and \nregulation of pension programs in Indonesia. The Jamsostek program is under the purview of \nMinistry of Manpower and Transmigration, the Taspen program is controlled by the Ministry of \nFinance, and the Asabri program is controlled by the Ministry of Defense. The Ministry of \nFinance  Pensions  Directorate  has  authority  only  to  supervise  voluntary  pensions,  not  the \nmandatory state-monopoly pension programs, which are, effectively, unsupervised. \n3.  The Government pension schemes of Taspen and Asabri suffer from significant future \nfunding problems stemming from increasing unfunded liabilities under the pay-as-you-go basis. \nExisting debt from past service is Rp342 trillion and Rp38.3 trillion for Taspen and Asabri, \nrespectively. Asabri is funded from current contributions and the Government\u2019s general budget. \nTaspen is partially funded from contributions and a small accumulation, but is largely funded \nfrom the general budget. In 2000, contributions to Taspen are estimated to have covered only \nRp0.6 trillion of the Rp14.1 trillion pension payments, the balance of Rp13.5 trillion to be met by \nthe Government\u2019s general budget and by drawing down the Taspen fund. Under the present \nsplit with Government covering 75% and Taspen covering 25% of pension payments, Taspen \nassets will be depleted by 2003. In view of low government salaries, benefit levels may not be \nadequate  if  not  properly  indexed  to  inflation.  However,  salary  increases  for  government \nemployees will further reduce the financial sustainability of pension schemes if the scheme \ndesign is not amended to compensate for this. As an example, possible 20% salary increases \nfor the next 5 years for government employees would impose significant additional liabilities of \nRp135 trillion and Rp17 trillion for Taspen and Asabri, respectively. The projected pension \npayments for Taspen2 are estimated as follows:    \n \n                                                 \n1  In August 2000, a Committee for the Improvement of National Social Security was formed. Coordinated by the \nVice President\u2019s Secretariat, this Committee is exploring options for introducing a minimum pension scheme and \nlegislation. \n2  ADB. 1998. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Reform of Pension and Provident Funds. \nManila. ", "  Appendix 1  27 \nTable A1.1: Total Projected Pension Payments for Taspen, 2000\u20132004 \n(Rp trillion) \nYear  Current  Assuming 20% Salary \nArrangements  Increases for 5 Years \n2000  14.1  14.1 \n2001  15.9  16.9 \n2002  17.5  19.8 \n2003  19.1  23.5 \n2004  20.8  27.8 \n \n4.  The proportion of Taspen\u2019s pension payment to be met by the Government will on \npresent indications increase to over 96% in 2004 and will remain at that level. In real terms, the \nannual contribution from the general budget to Taspen is expected to exceed Rp20 trillion \naround 2010 and Rp30 trillion around 2070 under current arrangements. Under the increased \nsalary scenario, that contribution would exceed Rp20 trillion in 2004, Rp30 trillion around 2010, \nand Rp40 trillion around 2020. \n \n5.  For Jamsostek, a defined contribution plan, the primary concern is that the plan as \npresently  designed  will  not  provide  sufficient  retirement  income,  potentially  burdening  the \nGovernment in the years ahead. Some critical concerns for Jamsostek include: low wage \nreplacement ratio (small retirement income provisions) due to low contribution rate and poor \ninvestment performance; lack of annuitization requirement; low coverage, underreporting of \nwages and lack of enforcement; lack of a common national identification number; and monopoly \nstatus  of  the  program,  precluding  the  development  of  potentially  more  effective  schemes. \nInstitutional and governance issues include: lack of transparency and disclosure; weak internal \ncorporate  governance  structures;  directed  investments  under  political  pressure  and  poor \nreturns; high administrative and operational costs; cross-subsidization between pension and \nnon-pension programs; payment of dividends and taxes to the Government due to corporate \nstatus;  a  general  perception  among  participants  that  there  is  no  independent  audit;  and \ninadequate  management  information  systems,  raising  the  possibility  of  underreporting  or \nmisallocation of contributions \n \n6.  General  lack  of  confidence  in  Jamsostek,  low  returns,  and  inadequate  benefits \ncontribute to the low 45% compliance rate for the program. Many issues for Jamsostek are \nthose  broadly  facing  the  pension  sector.  Improvements  in  supervision,  regulation,  and \ngovernance are required throughout, and industry practices and operations need to be brought \nin line with international standards. Encouraging competition and eliminating state monopolies \nwill be important factors in facilitating reform measures. Gradual elimination of the option for \none-off lump-sum benefits at retirement with no subsequent lifetime income is also important. \nTaking lump-sum benefits, a preferred practice in Indonesia, leaves room for myopic spending \nby retirees with the potential to significantly reduce or eliminate retirement savings. Additionally, \nthe severance and service benefits mandated for employees under separate legislation are not \nrequired to be separately funded, and do not provide protection for employees against employer \ninsolvency, which has been a frequent occurrence. \n \n7.  Investment allocation by pension fund managers continues to be heavily skewed toward \ntime deposits. Such investments have accounted for 70% of the portfolios of private pension \nfund managers. Investments in Bank Indonesia Certificates also account for a significant portion \nof pension fund portfolios. These investment patterns reflect the combination of low risk and \nrelatively attractive interest rates offered by these instruments as well as a lack of investor \n ", " 28  Appendix 1 \ninterest in the stock market due to the weak business environment and market governance \nissues. In part due to aggressive marketing by private pension companies, there appears to be \nan increasing awareness of the importance of pensions for providing income continuity into \nretirement. The number of participants in financial institution pension funds increased by 29.2% \nfrom 260,277 in 1999 to 336,213 in 2000, and estimated participants in 2001 were 400,000. \n \nB.

The  Government  announced  in  August  2002  its  plans  to  close  nine  insurance \ncompanies, and more firms, particularly in the life sector, are in danger of insolvency. It is \ngenerally  agreed  that  a  number  of  life  insurance  companies  in  Indonesia  were  already \nfundamentally unsound before the Asian financial crisis. A life insurance company can continue \nto operate in a deficit situation, vulnerable to a financial shock, for many years if the deficit is not \napparent and policyholders continue to pay premiums so that there is enough cash to meet \nclaims. Issues causing or allowing financial weakness to persist in the life insurance industry in \nIndonesia include: \n \n\u2022  small capital base of companies limiting ability to cope with fluctuations; \n\u2022  overoptimistic product pricing locking companies into payments not supportable by \ninvestment income, further eroding capital; \n\u2022  asset-liability mismatches exposing the companies to rollover risk; \n\u2022  high acquisition and maintenance expenses; \n\u2022  lack of management expertise and technical skills; \n\u2022  lack of transparency due to unreliable accounting and financial reporting; \n\u2022  lax enforcement of solvency requirements; \n\u2022  lack of autonomy of the insurance regulator; \n\u2022  weak internal governance; \n\u2022  controlling shareholders with objectives not consistent with policyholder interests; ", "  Appendix 1  29 \n\u2022  apparent corruption in claims settlement practices and use of intermediaries for \ndiversion of funds; and \n\u2022  lack of consumer protection provisions and procedures. \n \n9.  General areas of weakness identified for the life sector are similar for the nonlife sector \nin terms of a reform agenda. However, the nonlife sector is less vulnerable to collapse by \ncomparison. Its liabilities are short term and can be more easily managed, and the failure of a \nsingle company is less likely to be as devastating. Some concerns for the nonlife sector include \ncaptive companies established primarily to service parent groups and related organizations \n(rather  than  to  underwrite  insurance  on  a  commercial  basis);  lack  of  proper  controls  for \nengaging in surety insurance (loans, performance bonds, promissory notes); excessive reliance \non reinsurance cover; and writing international reinsurance with limited capacity and expertise. \n \n10.  Additional key issues in the insurance sector include a weak competitive position for the \nopening  of  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  markets  in  2003, \nunderdevelopment of the private sector, elimination of state monopolies, government exposure \nin SOEs, enhancement of the legal and regulatory system, development of tax-based incentives \nfor socially desirable forms of insurance, and development of institutions and legislation to \nimprove consumer protection. \n \nC.  Capital Markets Sector \n \n11.  Capital  markets  in  Indonesia  are  small  and  underdeveloped  in  comparison  to  the \nbanking sector. By the end of 2001, there were 189 securities companies licensed to act as \nbroker-dealers, 116 licensed to act as underwriters, and 47 licensed to act as investment \nmanagers. In terms of institutional investors, there were 108 mutual funds, 60 venture capital \nfunds,  62  life  insurance  companies,  109  nonlife  insurance  companies,  5  social  insurance \ncompanies, 327 private pension funds, and 3 public pension schemes. \n \n12.  The ability of firms to raise funds from Indonesia's capital markets is limited by the small \nsize  and  low  liquidity  of  these  markets\u2014with  market  capitalization  of  the  Jakarta  Stock \nExchange at only 16% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2001 (among the lowest in the \nregion).3  Apart  from  setbacks  due  to  political  and  macroeconomic  instability,  growth  and \ndevelopment of capital markets in Indonesia have been hindered by: \n \n\u2022  highly concentrated share ownership patterns among listed firms that contribute to \nlow market liquidity as well as weak corporate governance;4 \n\u2022  weak  governance  at  the  regulator,  financial  institution,  and  firm  levels,  which \nincreases the scope for market manipulation and undermines public confidence; \n\u2022  a small institutional investor sector: combined assets of the domestic pensions and \ninsurance sectors amounted to Rp51.2 trillion in 2001 or approximately 3.4% of \nGDP; \n\u2022  company groups that include banks as well as industrial firms, where capital needs \nare typically met through intra-group lending; \n\u2022  investor  bias  toward  bank  deposits:  this  is  particularly  pronounced  among \ninstitutional investors, whose portfolios are dominated by bank instruments. State-\n                                                 \n3  By way of comparison, stock market capitalization as a percentage of GDP in the Philippines was 77.6% in 2000. \n4  Most listed companies are majority owned by the founding shareholders with the general public holding 20\u201330% of \nthe total shares. \n ", " 30  Appendix 1 \nowned pension programs have over 90% of their assets invested in bank deposits \nwhile the corresponding figure for private pension funds is around 70%;  \n\u2022  a mutual ownership structure for domestic exchanges that weakens governance \nand limits their ability to raise capital for investment and expansion; \n\u2022  the lack, until very recently, of a government bond market to provide suitable \nbenchmarks for corporate bonds and private issues of securities;5 \n\u2022  shortage of qualified market professionals; and \n\u2022  globalization:  competition  from  larger,  more  efficient,  and  more  transparent \nmarkets  has  reduced  the  prospects  of  small  markets  everywhere,  including \nIndonesia's. Multinationals as well as large domestic firms have the option to raise \nmoney  offshore  where  costs  are  lower,  while  increasing  correlation  between \nmarkets  due  to  globalization  has  reduced  the  incentive  for  industrial  country \ninvestors to diversify into emerging markets.6 \n \nSelected capital market indicators are given in Table 3 in the main text. \n \nD.  Consolidated Regulatory and Supervisory Authorities \n \n13.  The emergence of integration of regulatory and supervisory powers over different types \nof financial institutions within a single agency first gained recognition in the 1980s as Norway \nand Denmark and then Sweden adopted an integrated approach to regulation. The banking \ncrises  in  these  countries  impacted  the  decision  to  adopt  this  structure,  and  subsequently \nincreasing interest and adoption of this approach in other regions, including Asia, have been \nseen. The institutional innovation and experience with implementation, in most countries that \nhave adopted this approach, are still at an early stage.  \n \n14.  The specifics of institutional responsibilities and powers have varied somewhat across \nthe group of innovators, and motivations underlying the move toward regulatory integration have \nincluded: \n \n\u2022  the  need  for  greater  consistency  in  the  application  of  policy  across  different \nindustries (i.e., regulatory neutrality); \n\u2022  the ability to make more efficient use of scarce regulatory resources; \n\u2022  economies of scale; \n\u2022  incapacity of small nonbank financial sectors to sustain separate and effective \nregulatory agencies;  \n\u2022  more effective supervision of financial conglomerates; and \n\u2022  the opportunity to improve the quality of supervision of specific sectors. \n \n15.  Efficient  use  of  regulatory  resources,  regulatory  neutrality,  and  the  opportunity  to \nimprove the quality of supervision of specific sectors are motivations that remain consistent \n                                                 \n5  Until the crisis, Indonesia had a balanced budget policy that did not allow for treasury bills and government bonds. \nThe first bond issue to finance recapitalization was in May 1999. \n6  The changing composition of investors in Indonesia's equity markets reflects this growing difficulty in remaining \nattractive to foreign investors. In 1996, investor composition was roughly equally split between local and foreign \ninvestors, while by 2001 foreign participation had dropped to about 10%. ", "  Appendix 1  31 \nacross  countries.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national  Yes  Sector identified as a national  Yes  \npriority in country poverty analysis?  priority in country poverty  \n  partnership agreement? \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \n \nSignificant weaknesses in financial governance lay at the heart of Indonesia's vulnerability to the recent \ncrises and remaining weaknesses have slowed the pace of its recovery. Stronger financial governance \nwill not only help reduce the likelihood and severity of future crises (and consequently help safeguard \nagainst corresponding marked increases in the incidence of poverty) but will also play a powerful, albeit \nindirect, role in poverty reduction through facilitating long-term economic growth. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Proposed Classification: Growth \nAnalysis: \nFinancial sector development facilitates long-term economic growth by supporting productivity growth and \nstimulating savings and investment. Of these two channels, raising productivity is the chief way of \npromoting  long-term  economic  growth.  Financial  sector  development  can  raise  productivity  by \n(i) improving resource allocation, and (ii) strengthening the monitoring of resource usage. A key factor in \nsupporting growth through this channel is the effectiveness of the legal, regulatory, and supervisory \nsystem in supporting financial sector efficiency. A well-governed financial sector can also stimulate growth \nand employment generation by increasing investor confidence and restoring the flow of much-needed \ninvestment capital to Indonesia. \n \nThat growth is instrumental to poverty reduction is incontrovertible. Growth, however, is turbulent and not \nnecessarily pro-poor. Growth entails change, which the poor may often not be well equipped to cope with. \nA well-governed financial sector that facilitates competition can help make growth user-friendlier by \n(i) improving access to savings, credit, and insurance instruments, which enable the poor to cushion \nshocks as well as take advantage of opportunities created by change, and (ii) allowing for better terms on \nthose instruments. \n \nAs noted above, a well-governed financial sector also reduces the likelihood and severity of financial \ncrises.  Balanced  financial  sector  development  can  likewise  promote  financial  system  stability  and \nstrengthening by allowing risks to be more evenly spread among different types of financial institutions \nand  spurring  competition  between  them.  In  hindsight,  one  of  the  indications  signaling  Indonesia's \nvulnerability to the recent crises, may have been found in the heavily unbalanced structural composition \nof its financial sector\u2014characterized by bank dominance and underdeveloped capital markets. \n \nReducing the scope for regulatory arbitrage between different types of financial institutions can help \npromote balanced financial sector development and the establishment of a consolidated regulatory and \nsupervisory  authority  can  significantly  facilitate  this  goal.  Also,  support  for  the  development  and \nstrengthening of certain types of financial institutions (e.g., pension funds and insurance companies) can \ndirectly and markedly stimulate development of other types of financial institutions (e.g., capital markets) \nby generating demand for their products. \n \nThe strengthening of social protection programs is also fundamentally interrelated with financial sector \ndevelopment. The pension and insurance sectors play direct and key roles in provision of instruments \nfor social protection. Their role, moreover, will assume increasing importance as reliance on family or \nindigenous systems of social security becomes less viable due to declining family size and increasing \npopulation mobility. Strengthening these sectors through improved regulation and supervision and \nwhere possible, through promoting competition, is fundamental if Indonesia is to develop an effective \nsocial safety net system.

Poverty Impact Assessment \n \nA.  Background \n1.  Poverty reduction relies on sustainable economic growth, good governance, and social \ndevelopment including social protection. This program loan promotes poverty reduction through \nall  three  channels.  Sustainable  economic  growth  is  underpinned  by  a  well-regulated  and \nsupervised financial system. This in turn requires good governance, a well-developed legal \nenvironment for regulation and institutional capacity for supervision, reduced opportunities for \ngraft and corruption, and greater access to timely information by industry players. The Program \nsupports reforms in the pension and insurance sector, and capital markets, enabling further \npotential  contributions  to  growth.  The  Program  supports  the  development  of  a  national \nframework for delivering social protection and helps to improve the supervisory frameworks for \npension and insurance firms that deliver services for the working population.  \n \n ", "56   Appendix 6 \n2.  About 35 million people or 37% of the labor force are in the formal sector. Of these, 15% \nare poor and another 15% are near poor.1 By 2001, 60% of the formal sector was covered by a \nmandatory  state  scheme,  the  main  source  of  coverage  for  lower  income  classes  and  the \nworking poor; however, compliance was less than 50%.  \n \n3.  Private insurance supplements the state programs. In 2000, about 1.2 million employees \nwere covered under employer pension funds, and financial institution pensions funds2 and \ninsurance premiums had risen to Rp7.2 trillion. The demand for insurance for workers in the \ninformal sector is growing. A number of insurance companies have programs targeting the lower \nend of the retail market such as pedicab drivers and sidewalk vendors. In general however, the \nlower end of the retail market is underdeveloped. Further expansion must be matched by \nadequate  regulation,  supervision,  and  enforcement  to  protect  consumers  against  risk  of \ninsurance failure and mismanagement.  \n \nB.  Poverty Impact Assessment of the Program \n4.  Taken as a whole, the reforms to the financial sector proposed under this cluster loan \nare necessary steps toward strengthening the financial sector and developing a system of \nnational social security. The measures to be undertaken under the first loan of the cluster are \ndescribed in the four subsections below: \n \n1.  Consolidate Regulatory and Supervisory Authority \n5.  The program for strengthening existing financial sector regulation and consolidating \nfinancial sector supervision and regulation facilitates regulatory neutrality, reduces regulatory \ndistortions,  thereby  promoting  better  allocation  of  resources  to  support  growth.  Including \nmandatory  social  insurance,  programs  under  the  authority  will  provide  protection  for  the \n25 million participants in core pension schemes and the more than 30 million participants in \nprivate  sector  insurance  programs.  Increased  harmonization  of  standards  in  line  with \ninternational best practices and greater efforts to increase compliance and enforcement with \nrules and regulations will lead to a more robust system and development of the financial sector, \nand reduce vulnerability to external shock. \n  \n6.  The consolidation of regulatory and supervisory authority under a single roof under the \nsecond loan in the cluster is likely to require smaller staff numbers than under the current \nsystem. This will lead to either redeployment or retrenchment of staff emanating from Bank \nIndonesia and the Ministry of Finance, each with their own employment and separation rules. \nPart of the preparation for the establishment of the consolidated regulatory and supervisory \nauthority  for  financial  services  (OJK),  supported  under  TA  3850-INO:  Establishment  of  a \nFinancial Services Authority will include a further review of the potential labor impact and \nrecommendations for an equitable process. The Government has represented that, although \nredeployment is expected, retrenchment is highly unlikely. It should also be noted that state \nemployees engaged in regulation and supervision are not drawn from the lowest level of the civil \nservice that comprises the vulnerable working poor, and past government reorganizations have \nresulted in redeployment rather than retrenchment. \n \n                                                 \n1  Calculated based on the proportion of the workforce in the formal sector in the lowest and second lowest quintile \nin 1999 (to be recalculated for 2000).  \n2  ADB. 2000. Indonesia Poverty Assessment. Manila. ", "  Appendix 6  57\n \n \n2.  Establish an Effective Anti-Money Laundering Regime \n7.  Indonesia  needs  to  continue  to  work  to  improve  its  anti-money  laundering  regime. \nMoney laundering activities have their origins in graft, corruption, and other forms of criminal \nactivity. These activities undermine the Government\u2019s legitimacy as well as investor confidence. \nThe development of an effective anti-money laundering regime will provide the Government with \nkey tools in its fight against graft and corruption and is fundamental to strengthening market \ngovernance and investor confidence. Indonesia has been included in the Financial Action Task \nForce on Money Laundering\u2019s (FATF) list of Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories (NCCT), \nand it needs to substantially comply with FATF recommendations to avoid countermeasures. \nThe countermeasures would significantly impede the ability of financial institutions located in \nIndonesia  and  of  Indonesian  financial  institutions  located  abroad  to  conduct  international \ntransactions. Imposition of countermeasures would have a disastrous impact on the country\u2019s \neconomic recovery. The loan will support the development of a legal framework and the building \nof institutional capacity necessary to implement an effective anti-money laundering regime. \n \n3.  Strengthen Financial and Corporate Governance \n8.  The Program will strengthen transparency and disclosure of market transactions and \nincrease efficiencies. Corporate responsibility and accountability are promoted through requiring \npublic companies to have independent commissioners and audit committees composed of a \nmajority  of  independent  commissioners,  and  imposing  adequate  liabilities  on  auditors  and \nliability on commissioners for false or misleading public information and board decisions. Market \nstability is promoted through prudential safeguards such as increased capital requirements, \nenhanced  rules  of  disclosure,  and  the  adoption  of  an  early  warning  system  of  financial \nexposure.  These  measures  will  increase  public  confidence  and  investor  participation \ncontributing to market liquidity and an expanded capital market to support growth. \n \n4.  Improve Pensions, Provident Funds, and Insurance, and Develop a National \nSocial Security System \n9.  These reforms are intended to strengthen the supervisory framework and promote a \nsound system for social benefits, to improve the system for pensions and provident funds to \nprovide adequate retirement income, and eventually to expand coverage to a wider segment of \nthe population. Strengthening the capacity of institutional investors can deepen the capital \nmarkets and enable the expansion of the social protection system and the provision of basic \npublic infrastructure.  \n \n10.  The measures to be undertaken under this reform area include: (i) assessment and \nspecial audits of mandatory programs, (ii) strengthening regulatory and supervisory capacity, \n(iii) strategic  restructuring  of  the  pension  and  insurance  sector,  and  (iv) development  of  a \nnational social security law and policy framework for pension and insurance. \n \n11.  The Program supports assessment of unfunded liabilities of mandatory social insurance \nschemes,  enabling  preparation  of  financial  options  to  reduce  these  liabilities  and  prevent \nunanticipated demands on the public budget. \n \n12.  Regulatory and supervisory capacities will be enhanced through measures to improve \ngovernance and timely disclosure of information regarding financial position, solvency, and \nownership of insurance companies as well as establishment of minimum competencies and \ntraining for insurance and pension fund supervisors and examiners. Prudential safeguards and \n ", "58   Appendix 6 \nenforcement of capital-based requirements will also provide greater consumer protection by \nensuring soundness of companies and their ability to meet obligations. \n \n13.  Development of a national social security law and policy framework for pension and \ninsurance requires a comprehensive evaluation of existing laws and frameworks impacting \npensions, insurance, and social protection. Such a law is required to ensure adequate system \nfor social security in the future, but requires decisions with far-reaching implications regarding \nthe role of the state and the private sector in providing social security and must be subject to \ndiscussion  and  debate.  The  Program  supports  a  feasibility  study  addressing  options  for \nimproving the current system and expanding access to the informal sector to support the \ndrafting of a new law on social security. The Program further supports discussion of the draft \nlaw with a broad range of civil society.  \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Assessment Matrix \n14.  Taken as a whole, the Program is poor-neutral in its direct impact and indirectly pro-poor \nsupporting the three pillars of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy, namely, pro-poor sustainable \neconomic growth, good governance, and social development. A poverty impact matrix is shown \nfor the overall Program as each component of the Program contributes to the same outcome.  \n ", "  Appendix 6  59\n \n \nTable A6: Poverty Impact of the Program \n \nIndirect Impact on   Mitigation or Enhancement \nChannel  the Poor\u2014Medium Term  Other Stakeholders  Measures \nLabor  Helps promote adequate retirement  Increased corporate  Potential negative labor \nincome for the working poor through  governance and improved  impacts resulting from \nstrengthening contractual saving  monitoring reduce the  consolidation of regulation and \nschemes.   possibility for market  supervisory authority, if any, \n  manipulation, fraud, and  are likely to be small.

The indirect impact is pro-poor. \nNarrative  The actions taken under the Program will promote sustainable growth and enable a more robust and \nefficient financial sector where participants are better informed and protected. Improved governance \nin the capital market improves investor confidence and provides an alternative to the banking sector, \nthus reducing an over reliance on bank debt and the potential for external shock. Increased access \nto financial markets creates employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled labor, and increased \nopportunities for small businesses. \n \nPension and insurance reforms enables workers (including the working poor) and their families to \nobtain contracted benefits and to provide greater protection in illness and old age, and in the event of \nthe loss of a breadwinner. \n \nIncreased transparency, stability, and supervision in financial markets increases the opportunities for \nlocal government, pension plans, and insurance schemes to raise funds and develop long-term \ninvestment and long-term savings instruments. This enables expansion of the provision of public \nservices to the poor and improves the reliability of the social protection system. \n \n ", "60   Appendix 7 \nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT \n \n1.
