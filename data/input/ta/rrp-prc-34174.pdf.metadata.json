An  environmental  impact  assessment  was \nundertaken, and the summary was circulated to the Board and \nmade public through the ADB website on 24 February 2005. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  is  in  Sichuan  Province  in  the  poor  southwestern \nregion  of  the  PRC.  In  2004,  the  per  capita  gross  domestic \nproduct of Sichuan was only 72% of the national average. The \nProject will support the Government\u2019s strategy by building an \nimportant section of the western region corridor connecting two \ngrowth centers\u2014Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, and Kunming, \nthe  capital  of  Yunnan  Province\u2014by  (i) constructing  an \nexpressway  across  mountainous  terrain;  (ii) improving  local \nroads servicing poor counties and townships; and (iii) providing \nconsulting services and training to enhance capacity at the local \ncommunications bureau, construction quality, road safety, and \nproject monitoring and evaluation. \n   \nRationale  Despite  considerable investment  in  the  road  sector,  the PRC \nroad network is still inadequate and does not provide efficient \naccess to large parts of the country, particularly in the poorer \ninland  regions,  including  Sichuan.  Better  transport  links  are \nnecessary to improve economic efficiency, foster domestic and \ninternational trade, facilitate interregional economic integration, \nand  promote  efficient  economic  growth,  thereby  reducing \npoverty.  Western  PRC  lacks  high-class  and  local  road \ninfrastructure.  The  integrated  road  network  comprising \nexpressways and local roads must therefore be developed to \nspread  economic  and  social  benefits.  To  enhance  economic \ndevelopment  and  reduce  poverty  in  the  western  region,  the \nGovernment is implementing the Western Region Development \nStrategy. The strategy aims to reduce development disparities \nbetween  the  western  and  coastal  regions.  The  Project  will \nsupport this strategy by developing an integrated road network \ncomprising expressways and local roads. The Sichuan provincial \ngovernment  (SPG)  has  identified  the  Project  as  a  priority \ninvestment,  which  will  link  up  with  an  ongoing  ADB-financed \nSouthern  Sichuan  Roads  Development  Project,  thereby \nfacilitating completion of the 900-kilometer (km) route connecting \nChengdu and Kunming. \n   ", "iv \nObjectives  The principal objective of the Project is to develop an integrated \nroad  transport  system  to  support  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment  in  Sichuan.  Local  roads  will  complement  the \nexpressway in bringing benefits to rural residents. The Project \nwill (i) reduce traffic accidents and vehicle operating costs; (ii) \nimprove  access  between  Chengdu  and  Kunming;  (iii)  provide \nadditional transport capacity to accommodate growing traffic; (iv) \nimprove access to jobs, markets, and social services; and (v) \ndevelop  the  capacity  of  local  communications  bureaus.  The \nProject has the following components: (i) construction of a 244 \nkm, four-lane access-controlled toll expressway from Ya\u2019an to \nLugu,  including  access  roads,  interchanges  with  toll  stations, \ntunnels, bridges, administrative stations, and service areas; (ii) \nupgrading of 678 km of local roads to improve access to poor \nremote  areas,  and  roadside  stations;  (iii)  construction  of  four \npublic transport centers; (iv) procurement of equipment for road \nmaintenance,  toll  collection,  surveillance  and  communications, \ntunnel  operation  facilities,  vehicle weigh  stations,  road  safety, \nand office administration; (v) land acquisition and resettlement; \n(vi) consulting services for construction supervision, road safety \naudit, monitoring and evaluation, and capacity building; and (v) \ndeveloping  local  communications  bureaus\u2019  capacity  for \nmaintenance. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  physical  and  price \ncontingencies  and  interest  during  construction,  is  estimated  at \n$2,077 million equivalent, of which $931 million (45%) is in foreign \nexchange and $1,146 million equivalent (55%) in local currency. \n   \nFinancing Plan   ($ million)\nForeign  Local  Total \n    Source  Exchange  Currency  Cost \n    Asian Development Bank   600.0  0.0  600.0 \n    Ministry of Communications   0.0  272.4  272.4 \n    Sichuan Provincial Government   331.0  328.7  659.7 \n    China Development Bank   0.0  544.9  544.9 \n    Total  931.0  1,146.0  2,077.0 \n%        45         55       100 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A $600 million loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  26-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 6 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The ADB loan proceeds will be made available by the Borrower \nTerms  to SPG, and through SPG, to the Project Company on the same \nfinancial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. The \n ", "v \nProject Company will bear the interest rate variation and foreign \nexchange risks. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 March 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 September 2011 \nCompletion Date   \n   \nImplementation  The  Project  Company  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency \nArrangements  responsible for the Project. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Sichuan Provincial Communications Department (SPCD) \n   \nProcurement  Goods and services financed by the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works \nfor  the  expressway  and  local  roads  will  be  procured  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  On  11  March  2005,  ADB \napproved advance action for procurement of civil works. \n   \nConsulting Services  The  Project  will  provide  66  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services to (i) help with project management during \nconstruction;  (ii) provide  expertise  in  tunnel  and  bridge \nconstruction; (iii) conduct a safety audit of the project design, and \nmake  safety  recommendations  on  the  completed  construction \nworks; (iv) help set up and implement quality control procedures; \n(v) monitor the environmental impact of the Project and provide \nguidance on environmental mitigation measures as well as help \ndevelop  capacity  in  vehicle  emissions;  (vi) help  formulate  a \ncapacity  development  program;  and  (vii) help  establish  and \nimplement a project performance management system. The team \nleader  will be  in  the  field  during construction  and  will  act  as \nassistant  chief  supervision  engineer,  (i) helping  the  chief \nsupervision engineer certify variation orders, contractor\u2019s monthly \npayments,  and  subcontracting  documents;  and  (ii) helping \nestablish a contract management system. All consultants to be \nfinanced  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  selected  and  engaged \nbased  on  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by \nthe Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers. The domestic \nconsultants  for  construction  supervision  will  be  financed  by \nSPCD  and  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  government \nprocedures. \n   \nProject Benefits and  By  developing  an  integrated  expressway  and  complementary \nBeneficiaries  local  road  network,  the  Project  will  help  improve  access  to \nmarkets and social services for the rural poor residents in the \nproject area. The Project will reduce transport time and costs, \nand thereby encourage investment, create jobs, and increase \nincomes. The economic internal rate of return for the Project is \nestimated at 15.2%. The financial internal rate of return for the \nexpressway component is 5.4%, which is higher than the real \n ", "vi \nweighted average cost of capital. There are 273,000 poor people, \nor 29% of the total population in the project area, living below the \nincome levels of CNY900 per year in rural areas and minimum \nliving standards in urban areas. The main project beneficiaries of \nthe local road component will be households in poor counties and \ntownships  in  the  project  area,  providers  of  rural  transport, \nindustrial  and  agricultural  businesses,  agriculture-based \nhouseholds producing grains and vegetables for local markets, \npeople living in the project area who will have easier access to \nlong-distance  transport,  and  transport  operators  and  their \ncustomers for transit traffic. The Project will also help reduce \ntraffic  accidents,  vehicle  emissions,  and  traffic  noise  on  the \nexisting roads. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project was formulated to keep to a minimum the potential \ntechnical, safety, economic, financial, and resettlement risks. The \nmain technical risks, which could result in implementation delays \nand cost overruns, are associated with the tunnels (34.5 km in \ntotal)  and  bridges  (64.0  km  in  total).  To  mitigate  the  risks, \ninternational  consultants  reviewed  the  proposed  design  and \nconstruction methods. Prequalification of contractors focuses on \ntheir financial and technical capability in handling complex works. \nDuring  construction,  monitoring  and  contract  management \ninformation systems will be set up and implemented, with the \nassistance  of  the  international  consultants,  for  timely \nidentification  of  technical  problems  and  implementation  of \ncorrective measures. Given the safety hazards associated with \nbridge works, the contractors will be required to strictly enforce \nworking safety rules and measures. SPCD has experience and \nhas  shown  satisfactory  performance  in  implementing \ninternationally financed projects. \n   \n  Economic performance in the project-influenced area would have \nto  deteriorate  substantially  for  the  Project  to  lose  economic \nviability.  The  financial  risks  associated  with  construction  and \noperation  of  the  expressway  will  depend  on  the  actual \nconstruction costs, ability of the commercial management, and \nappropriate  tolls.  To  mitigate  the  financial  risks,  the  Project \nCompany will build up a commercial business environment for \nexpressway  operations,  the  project  expressway  will  receive \nsubstantial equity from the central and provincial governments, \nand  an  appropriate  toll  structure will  be  adopted.  Appropriate \ncoordination and monitoring mechanisms will be put in place to \nmitigate resettlement risks. The social risks include resettlement, \nhuman  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immunodeficiency \nsyndrome infection, and ethnic minority communities associated \nwith the Project. Appropriate mitigation measures are in place in \nthe resettlement plan, the ethnic minorities development plan, \nand the social action development plan. \n ", "", " ", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Central Sichuan Roads Development Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The PRC\u2019s economic growth since the 1980s has substantially increased the demand for \ntransport services. The economy\u2019s changing structure and increasing diversification have altered \nthe pattern of transport demand. The demand for road transport has outpaced that of other \ntransport modes. There is a rapidly increasing movement of goods and passengers by road, \nwhich is more flexible and responsive than other modes to the needs of a market economy. The \nshift in transport demand also reflects the loosening of anticompetitive restrictions in the road \ntransport industry itself. From 1990 to 2004, road traffic grew by 9.0% per annum (p.a.) for \npassenger traffic, reaching 876.5 billion passenger-kilometers (km); and by 6.0% p.a. for freight, \nreaching 759.7 billion ton-km. In Sichuan, road traffic grew by 6.5% p.a. for passenger traffic, \nreaching 51.7 billion passenger-km, and by 4.2% p.a. for freight, reaching 27.2 billion ton-km. In \n2004, road traffic accounted for 53.7% of the country\u2019s total passenger traffic and 11.4% of the \ntotal freight traffic while the corresponding figures for Sichuan Province were 76.0% and 26.3%. \nThe vehicle fleet will continue to expand with the country\u2019s rapid economic growth, low vehicle \nownership rates, lower automobile prices after World Trade Organization accession, increasing \naccess  to  loans  to  finance  automobile  purchases,  and  large  investment  in  automotive \nmanufacturing. \n \n3.  To meet the growing demand for improved transport infrastructure and services, the \nGovernment\u2019s policy for the road sector, as reflected in its 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005), calls \nfor (i) accelerating the construction of the network of highways and national roads, with a focus on \nfive north\u2013south and seven east\u2013west sections of the national trunk highway system; (ii) starting \nconstruction of eight new highways for 18,000 km in the western region; (iii) by 2005, opening \napproximately 1.95 million km of highways to traffic, with expressways1 accounting for 35,000 km; \nand (iv) starting the national expressway network plan to complete 85,000 km by 2040 with \nannual investment of CNY100 billion\u2013150 billion. \n \n4.  While the national trunk highway system is being developed, accessibility in most of rural \nPRC is still low: 145 townships and 50,124 villages, most in the western region, have no access \nto all-weather roads. Many townships and villages still depend on earth tracks that are not \nsuitable for motorized traffic and become impassable during the rainy season. Even where all-\nweather roads have been built, the standard of rural roads is low, maintenance is poor, and many \nroads need rehabilitation. The central Government thus completed 71,000 km of rural roads at \nthe cost of CNY60.9 billion, supported by the local governments that constructed 68,000 km, \ncosting CNY57.6 billion, in 2004. The Government targets developing a road network that will \nreach 99.8% of townships by 2005. The Government plans to invest CNY100 billion in developing \nrural roads during the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010). By 2010, all villages in the eastern \nregion will be linked with paved roads, and the same targets will be applied to 80% villages in the \ncentral  region  and  90%  towns  in  the  western  region.  In  2003,  the  Sichuan  Provincial \nCommunications Department (SPCD) prepared the Sichuan Province Rural Road Development \n                                                           \n1  The PRC had 34,200 km of expressways in 2004, second only to the United States. ", "2 \nPlan 2020. By the end of 2005, SPCD plans to construct 2,059 km of roads to 50 townships \nwithout road access, as well as 25,908 km for 5,261 villages and, by the end of 2010, 8,500 km \nand 32,000 km, respectively. In the project area, the plan aims to improve 1,500 km of the \nsecondary  and  tertiary  network  by  2010.  These  major  programs  by  the  central  and  local \ngovernments will be a pro-poor initiative; surveys during the feasibility study showed that the poor \npeople  highly  ranked  improved  roads  as  an  infrastructure  development  priority.  The \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to reducing poverty through transport infrastructure investment is \nreflected in the poverty partnership agreement between the Government and ADB.2 The main \nfeatures  of  the  proposed  Project  are  summarized  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework \n(Appendix 1). \n \n5.  The  significant  road  sector  development  during  the  9th  Five-Year  Plan  (1996\u20132000) \nresulted in road investments totaling CNY924 billion, or CNY185 billion per year. The road sector \ninvestment grew at an average annual rate of 16%. During the 10th Five-Year Plan, the total \ninvestment is expected to reach about CNY1,800 billion, almost double that in the previous 5 \nyears.  In  line  with  the  increase  in  investment,  the  PRC\u2019s  road  network  expanded  to \n1.86 million km in 2004, an increase of 46,000 km from 2003. The vehicle fleet totaled 24 million \ntrucks, cars, and buses, and 72 million other motorized vehicles (motorcycles and agricultural \nvehicles). Details of a road sector analysis are in Appendix 2. SPCD invested about CNY16.2 \nbillion in the road sector in 2004, of which CNY12.9 billion was allocated to construction and \nCNY1.4 billion to maintenance. During the 10th Five-Year Plan, road investment is expected to \nbe about CNY71 billion. SPCD plans to increase the road investment to CNY78 billion during the \n11th Five-Year Plan (Appendix 3). \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n6.  Sichuan  is  in  southwestern  PRC,  surrounded  by  mountains.  Its  isolation  has  been \nreduced by improved navigation on the Yangtze River, railway construction, and the construction \nof several major highways. Most of the population is concentrated on the flat, fertile plain in the \neast and central east, but the province contains several poverty-stricken areas in its mountainous \nperiphery, where the Project is located. Despite rapid development in recent years, Sichuan ranks \nseventh lowest of all provinces in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita: CNY7,514 in \n2004, or 72% of the national average. The per capita rural income was CNY2,580, or 88% of the \nnational average. About one third of the counties are officially designated as poor. There are \n282,500 poor people in the project area, equivalent to 29% of the total population, living below the \nincome levels of CNY900 per year in rural areas and the minimum living standards in urban areas. \n \n7.  Based on the findings of the feasibility study under an ADB-financed technical assistance \n(TA),3 one  reason  for  high  poverty  is  slow  economic  growth,  partly  because  of  inadequate \ninfrastructure. Despite the considerable investments, the road network in the project area is still \ninadequate and does not provide efficient transport access to markets and social services such \nas education and health. Around 30% of villages in Hanyuan and Mianning still have no road \naccess. Over the whole project area, over 60% of villages have paved road access but only one \nthird have bus services. The proportions in Shimian and Mianning are much lower, with under a \nquarter of villages having paved road access and less than 20% having bus services. In the last 3 \nyears, local governments have improved access to 13 townships (10% of the total) and 29 \nvillages (4%). These road improvements have led to the provision of bus services to these \n                                                           \n2  Available at http://www.adb.org/Documents/Poverty/pa_prc.pdf. \n3 ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Central Sichuan Roads \nDevelopment Project. Manila. \n ", "3 \ncommunities. Bus services are a vital element in the rural transport system of the project area \ndue to low vehicle ownership. Despite these improvements, the quality of access to many villages \nremains  unsatisfactory,  with  low-standard  and  poorly  maintained  roads  often  susceptible  to \nclosure due to landslides, flooding, and snow falls. Bus service to townships off the main roads is \ninfrequent, with about only three or four trips per day. Between villages and townships, small \nbuses operate where road conditions permit, but travel is mostly by small truck, foot, or horse. \n \n8.  The impact of road investments on poverty reduction is supported by the results of studies \nand evaluations of several completed road projects financed by ADB4 and the World Bank.5 Well-\nintegrated road development helps ensure that the benefits derived from the expressway filter \ndown to the poor. Benefits from transport cost savings and time savings, along with an increase \nin incomes, will be passed on through the transport chain to townships and villages. These results \naffirm the relevance of ADB\u2019s strategy in the PRC road sector. A TA6 will help the Government \nformulate a road network strategy that better integrates expressways and local roads to meet \ncommunities\u2019 needs and support economic growth, and that provides road agencies with cross-\ndisciplinary skills and tools through capacity building. A case study in Shaanxi Province found that \nimproved roads were correlated with poverty reduction, and that (i) 3.2 poor people are lifted out \nof poverty for every CNY10,000 invested in roads; and (ii) for every 1% increase in kilometer of \nroad per capita, household consumption increases by 0.08%.7 Benefits for rural poor areas \ninclude  lower  transport  costs;  lower  cost  of  inputs;  expanded  agricultural  support  services; \nimproved farming practices; greater access to urban jobs; and better access to health, education, \nand social services.8 \n \n9.  To help the Government develop its road sector strategy and investment projects, external \nassistance has been provided mainly from ADB, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation \n(JBIC), and the World Bank (Appendix 4). Since 1991, ADB has provided 30 loans, totaling nearly \n$5.6 billion, to finance about 4,100 km of expressways, together with 7,600 km of associated local \nroad networks. Since 1995, local roads have been included in the scope of road projects to make \nADB\u2019s interventions in the road sector more pro-poor. Of the ADB-financed projects, 18 have \nbeen completed and are open to traffic. ADB has also provided 50 TAs, totaling $26.9 million, to \nthe road sector. The advisory TAs have addressed poverty impact of road projects, policy and \ninstitutional reforms, including highway planning, road safety,9 human resource development, \ntransport pricing, commercialization and corporatization, and the mobilization of private financial \nresources.

ADB coordinates with the World Bank and JBIC. Each \nmajor development partner focuses on different corridors, while information related to policy \nadvice is shared across the development community. \n \nC.  Policy Dialogue \n \n10.  Integrated Design and ADB Financing of the Local Road Component. The rural poor \nhave limited mobility beyond their immediate communities because of their geographical isolation \nand the high cost of motorized transport. As a result, they generally view local roads as a key \ninfrastructure investment priority. Benefits for poor rural areas include lower transport costs, lower \ncost of inputs, expanded agricultural support services, and therefore improved farming practices, \ngreater access to urban jobs and to health, education, and social services. Better roads promote \nthe transition from a subsistence farming rural economy to a cash crop and more diversified \neconomy with a higher and more stable income flow to rural households, reducing poverty. Better \nintegration of the local roads into the trunk highway system will help bring benefits to the poor \nmore effectively. \n \n11.  The  dialogue  with  the  Government  focused  on  the  need  to  integrate  the  local  road \ncomponent into the project scope with ADB\u2019s financing to establish a credible linkage between \npoverty reduction and ADB\u2019s assistance based on the experience of the ongoing and completed \nADB-financed road projects since 1995.10 The Government agreed to integrate the local road \ncomponent with ADB\u2019s financing; the component comprised 678 km (Appendix 5), which was \nselected on the basis of population density, poverty incidence, and road network efficiency from \nthe Sichuan Provincial Rural Road Development Plan. These roads are in poor condition and are \nnot passable during the rainy season. Upon completion, they will connect the main trunk highway \nand the poor or minority townships and villages in the Project\u2019s hinterland. The Project will \nupgrade the roads to higher road class, costing $68.8 million, of which $17.5 million will be \nfinanced from the ADB loan. The local road component, together with the expressway, will serve \n938,930 people in the project area, of whom about 273,000, or 29%, are poor, living on under \nCNY900 per capita per year in rural areas and below the minimum living standards in urban \nareas. The component will (i) be implemented concurrently with the expressway component and \nmaintained by the county governments under the guidance of SPCD,11 (ii) use the Ministry of \nCommunications (MOC) technical designs and standards, and (iii) be monitored and evaluated to \nensure that its poverty impacts are enhanced.12 \n \n12.  Corporate  Governance.  In  Sichuan,  expressway  construction  and  operation  were \nseparated  from  the  provincial  government  under  previous  ADB-financed  road  projects.  This \ncorporatization has promoted corporate governance and improved operational efficiency. SPCD \nhas established an expressway company (the Project Company), which will be responsible for \nconstruction and operations of the project expressway. It will be entitled to collect tolls and retain \ntoll revenue and will repay the proposed loan. SPCD and the Project Company will enter into a \n                                                           \n10 Since 1995, the scope of the 20 ADB-financed road projects has been expanded to enhance their impacts on poverty \nreduction by integrating local road improvements to benefit poor communities. The local road components of these \nprojects are being implemented or have been completed successfully, helping improve living standards of the poor in \nthe project area. \n11 Road maintenance expenditures in Sichuan have increased at 4\u20136% per annum, reaching CNY1.42 billion in 2004. \nWhile road maintenance is generally good, it must be improved, particularly for low-class roads. \n12 While improving infrastructure is important, competition in providing road transport services is also important to \nensure that some of the savings in transport costs are passed onto local farmers as reduced tariff. \n ", "5 \nconcession  framework  agreement13 (Supplementary  Appendix  A)  by  31  December  2007  to \nensure autonomy of operations, encourage the establishment of road performance indicators, \nand facilitate refinancing of road sector assets. SPCD will prepare a corporate development plan \nby 31 December 2007 to assure high standards of corporate governance, management practices, \nand financial reporting. These agreements and plans will be implemented with the help of the \nloan-financed  consultants  during  project  implementation.  The  corporatization  process  will  be \nguided by the model documents14 developed under ADB-financed TA.15 To help with the process \nof corporatization, training will be provided under the loan to the staff of the Project Company. \n \n13.  Private Sector Development. In the PRC, the private sector has been involved in the \nroad  sector  through  cooperative  joint  ventures,  securitization  through  initial  public  offerings, \nrevenue bond financing, involving the sale of rated notes backed by a pledge of an entity\u2019s cash-\nflow sources, and a build-operate-transfer method (Supplementary Appendix B). For this Project, \nin line with ADB\u2019s private sector development strategy,16 consideration was given to various \napproaches  to  highway  financing  recommended  under  an  ADB-financed  TA  (footnote  15), \nincluding  securitization.17 The  options  for  financing  the  project  expressway  were  examined. \nCapacity to attract private financing, particularly equity capital, for road projects such as the \nproject  expressway\u2014with  low  initial  demand  and  low  financial  returns  but  high  long-term \neconomic returns\u2014is limited. Therefore, project construction will be financed from public sources. \nPrivate sector financing options, including contracting out operation and maintenance (O&M) to \nthe private sector, will be examined before operations start. ADB will favorably consider such \nrefinancing for the Project, provided that advance notice is received and the proposal meets \nADB\u2019s standards of good governance, transparency, and project viability. SPCD involved the \nprivate sector for four expressways,18 raising about CNY4 billion during 1997 and 2001, including \nsecuritization of the Chengdu\u2013Chongqing expressway on the Hong Kong, China, stock exchange. \n \n14.  Road Safety. Road safety is a serious issue in the PRC, including Sichuan. In 2004, there \nwere 567,753 road accidents, involving 451,810 injuries and 99,217 fatalities, or 41 deaths per \n10,000 vehicles, which is very high by international standards.19 In 2004, there were 28,484 \nreported accidents, with 4,890 fatalities and 28,218 injuries. The Ministry of Public Security, which \nis responsible for enforcement of traffic laws and regulations, is committed to reducing accidents \nthrough improved safety of vehicles, driver training, and improved traffic management. The road \ntraffic safety law was made effective in May 2004, with the help of an ADB-financed TA. 20 Also in \nMay  2004,  an  interministerial  committee,  coordinated  by  MOC,  involving  15  ministries  and \n                                                           \n13 The main objective of the concession framework agreement is related to the operation phase of the Project, so \nconstruction may start before the agreement is finalized. \n14 Available: http://www.chineseinfrastructure.com. \n15 ADB. 1997.

Under \nthe  Project,  the  Sichuan  Expressway  Traffic  Police  will  establish  a  team  to  patrol  the  new \nexpressway, enforce traffic regulations, and maintain smooth traffic flow. To address road safety \nissues, the Project will include the following: (i) vehicle-weighing stations; (ii) road safety training \nfor staff of SPCD; (iii) safety audit during design and construction; (iv) public awareness and \neducation campaigns, and accident prevention; and (v) a traffic enforcement program. These will \nbe  carried  out  with  the  assistance  of  a  road  safety  specialist  financed  under  the  loan \n(Supplementary Appendix C). \n \n15.  Vehicle Emissions. With the rapid increase in vehicle ownership, vehicle emissions will \ndamage the environment if mitigation measures are not taken. Fragmented responsibility, lack of \ninterdepartmental coordination, and an inadequate database and monitoring system prevent the \nformulation of specific targets for a reduction in vehicle emissions. With assistance from transport \nagencies and the Public Security Bureau, the Sichuan Environment Protection Bureau conducts \nvehicle emission testing and random spot checks. The emission and safety check is mandatory \nfor all motor vehicles registered in the province. All buses and public taxis in Chengdu are now \npowered by compressed natural gas (CNG). More CNG filling stations are being built throughout \nthe urban areas of the province. SPCD is committed to controlling vehicle emissions. International \nconsultants will provide an action plan and training to control vehicle emissions in the project \narea, in light of the findings of the ADB-financed TA22 on vehicle emissions (Supplementary \nAppendix C). \n \nD.  Lessons Learned \n \n16.  SPCD has prepared and implemented three internationally financed road projects23 well \nand without major problems. The safeguard policies on environment, involuntary resettlement, \nand  indigenous  people  have  been  met.  Lessons  learned  from  the  Chengdu\u2013Nanchong \nexpressway project24 include the need for (i) conducting more detailed geological investigations \nbefore finalizing bidding documents; (ii) integrating the local road component into the expressway \ndevelopment to enhance poverty impact; (iii) drawing up a detailed resettlement plan, which should \nbe updated after a detailed measurement survey, to effectively assess its implementation; (iv) \nseparating expressway construction and operations from the provincial government function to \nimprove corporate governance; and (v) strengthening local communications bureaus for road \nmaintenance. These lessons were brought to the attention of the Government and SPCD and \nreflected in the project design. \n \n17.  Performance reviews25 of completed ADB-financed road projects elsewhere in the PRC \nindicate  that,  in  general,  the  projects  facilitated  economic  growth  and  reduced  poverty  as \nenvisaged during project preparation. Completed projects show that (i) ADB\u2019s safeguard policies \n                                                           \n21 MOC, Ministry of Public Security, National Development and Reform Commission, National Quality Control Bureau, \nNational Safety Bureau, National Industry and Commerce Bureau, and State Council\u2019s Law and Regulations Office. \n22 ADB. 2000.

Project \ncompletion reports prepared for 16 road projects concluded that 15 were highly or generally \nsuccessful and 1 partly successful.27 The project performance audit reports for four road projects \nrated the projects as either highly successful or successful. The lessons learned from ADB-\nfinanced road projects are reflected in the project design. A development impact study28 of the \n1,867 km Beijing\u2013Tongjiang expressway route, for which ADB provided loans totaling $1.2 billion, \nshowed that the improved road network significantly helped develop northeastern PRC. Lessons \nfrom these projects have been brought to the attention of SPCD, particularly with reference to \nimplementation.  To  avoid  delayed  loan  effectiveness  caused  by  delays  in  procurement,  a \ntendering  company  has  been  recruited  to  prequalify  the  civil  works  contractors.  ADB\u2019s \nprocurement guidelines and requirements were discussed extensively during missions. Emphasis \nwas put on the need to (i) strictly follow ADB\u2019s mandatory bidding documents, (ii) evaluate bids \naccording to ADB-approved evaluation criteria, and (iii) clearly substantiate the conclusions of the \nbid evaluation. \n \nE.  Rationale \n \n18.  ADB's operational strategy29 in the road sector supports (i) construction of roads that \nconnect major growth centers and link the hinterland economies; (ii) integration of the network so \nthat the national trunk highway system is supported by a system of local roads, particularly those \nthat  provide  access  to  poor  areas;  (iii) promotion  of  road  safety  and  reduction  of  vehicle \nemissions; (iv) institutional strengthening to increase the commercial orientation and efficiency of \nexpressway  organizations;  (v) improvement  of  highway  planning  and  evaluation  techniques; \n(vi) adoption of pricing policies to ensure optimum use of road transport capacity; and (vii) use of \nalternative methods of investment financing, including private sector participation. ADB road \nsector assistance targets the less developed central and western provinces, where most of the \npoor live. The proposed Project is consistent with the PRC\u2019s development priorities and ADB\u2019s \nstrategy. \n \n19.  Despite the considerable investments in the road sector, the PRC road network is still \ninadequate and does not provide efficient transport to large parts of the country, particularly in the \npoorer inland regions, including Sichuan. Better transport links are necessary to improve economic \nefficiency, foster domestic and international trade, facilitate interregional integration, and reduce \npoverty. Western PRC lacks high-class road infrastructure in and outside the region, and between \nand within provinces in the region. The road network must be developed to facilitate sustainable \neconomic development and ensure that investments impact poor areas and rural residents in the \n                                                           \n26 ADB. 1998.

This lower rating is mainly due to inadequate safety facilities and enforcement, as well as partial compliance \nwith environmental mitigation measures. Remedial actions were taken by rectifying the infrastructure deficiencies, \nenforcing harsher penalties for traffic violations, and implementing the environmental mitigation measures. As a \nresult, the project was rated successful by the project performance and audit report. \n28 ADB. 2002.

To  enhance  economic \ndevelopment and reduce poverty in western PRC, the Government is implementing the Western \nRegion  Development  Strategy,  which  is  the  key  theme  of  the  10th  and  11th  5-year  plans.  \nThe strategy aims to reduce development disparities between the western and coastal regions.  \nThe Project will support this strategy. It will be the third road project for ADB financing in Sichuan. \nThe first one has been successfully completed and the second one is under implementation. \n \n20.  During the 2005 Country Programming Mission, the Government reconfirmed its request \nfor ADB assistance for the Project. A feasibility study was completed by SPCD in December 2002. \nAn environmental impact assessment (EIA) was prepared in December 2004, and a resettlement \nplan in November 2004. ADB provided TA (footnote 3) to supplement the government studies. \nFact-finding was undertaken from 24 January to 3 February 2005, and appraisal from 14 to 22 \nMarch  2005.  The  Project  was  formulated  on  the  basis  of  the  findings  of  ADB  missions, \ninformation  provided  by  the  Government,  stakeholder  consultations,  discussions  with  other \nfunding agencies, and recommendations of the feasibility study and TA consultants. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n21.  The  Project  will  develop  an  integrated  road  transport  system  to  support  sustainable \neconomic development in Sichuan. Local roads will complement the expressway in bringing \nbenefits to rural residents. The Project will (i) reduce traffic accidents and vehicle operating costs; \n(ii) improve access between Chengdu and Kunming, two major growth centers in southwestern \nPRC;  (iii)  provide  additional  transport  capacity  to  accommodate  growing  traffic;  (iv)  improve \naccess  to  jobs,  markets,  and  social  services;  and  (v)  develop  the  capacity  of  local \ncommunications bureaus. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n22.  The Project integrates the expressway and local roads in its design to benefit townships \nand villages. The Project has the following components: (i) construction of a 244 km, four-lane \naccess-controlled toll expressway from Ya\u2019an to Lugu, including access roads, interchanges with \ntoll stations, tunnels, bridges, administrative stations, and service areas; (ii) upgrading of 678 km \nof local roads to improve access to poor remote areas, and roadside stations; (iii) rehabilitation of \nfour public transport centers; (iv) procurement of equipment for road maintenance, toll collection, \nsurveillance and communications, tunnel operation facilities, vehicle weigh stations, road safety, \nand  office  administration;  (v)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement;  (vi)  consulting  services  for \nconstruction supervision, road safety audit, monitoring and evaluation, and capacity building; and \n(v) developing capacity of local communications bureaus for maintenance. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n23.  Public Transport Center. Because of the poor road infrastructure in the project area, \npublic transport service is inadequate, given the limited routes and bus service in remote poor \nareas. Many towns and villages with poor or no road access still have no direct bus service. For \nexample, only 63% of towns are served by bus in Mianning county. Bus service in villages is even \nmore limited, from 17% in Mianning to 50% in Hanyuan county. No cross-county routes provide \ndirect connections across township boundaries without going through township centers. In order \nto provide poor, remote areas with better public transport services, Sichuan plans to develop 9 \nprovincial public transport centers by 2015, with 90 county public transport centers, including \n ", "9 \nrehabilitation of 4 that are included in the Project. Each center will have a handling capacity of \n5,000 passengers per day, enable longer public transport routes that can reach towns and \nvillages, improve the quality of service, reduce costs to users, and ensure more efficient use of \nbus fleet. An assessment of transport services is in Appendix 6. \n \n24.  Intelligent Transport System. An intelligent transport system (ITS)30 on expressways is \nbeing introduced in accordance with the national ITS architecture prepared by the National ITS \nCenter. In Sichuan, an expressway ITS policy is being drafted to (i) introduce a network-wide \nexpressway tolling system; (ii) reduce toll payment delay; (iii) improve safety through enhanced \nmonitoring; (iv) improve traveler information; (iv) assist in emergencies; and (v) improve traffic \nenforcement, infrastructure maintenance, and computerized management of urgent incidents. \nThe use of an ITS will be built into the Project through procurement of equipment and training and \nwill be implemented with the help of the international consultants. ITS includes (i) fewer traffic \ncontrol centers; (ii) advanced toll payment; (iii) variable message displays to improve driver \ninformation; (iv) use of surveillance technology; and (v) detection of blackspot locations and \nweather conditions; (vi) monitoring of speed limit, overloaded vehicles, and toll payment; and (v) \nprovision of current information to improve road safety (Supplementary Appendix D). \n \n25.  Asset Management. Expressway companies in Sichuan do not make significant use of \nmodern techniques in their asset management and road maintenance programs. The Project \nCompany will use a computerized database, which will have the following merits: (i) more robust \ndecision  making  based  on  a  greater  pool  of  data,  (ii)  the  ability  to  share  information  and \nexperiences with external agencies, (iii) enhance professional skills, and (iv) better information to \nencourage  policy  makers  to  prioritize  asset  management  and  maintenance.  A  number  of \nmeasures  will  be  introduced  with  the  help  of  the  international  consultants  to  facilitate \nimplementation. They will meet three strategic objectives: (i) almost immediate: measures for \nimplementation when the Project Company\u2019s organizational structure is put in place; (ii) short \nterm:  measures  for  implementation  before  expressway  completion;  and  (iii)  medium  term: \nmeasures for implementation within the first 2\u20133 years of expressway operations (Supplementary \nAppendix D). \n \n26.  Roadside  Stations. Road projects have traditionally focused on expanding transport \ncapacity  to  maximize  economic  impact.  Achieving  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  by \ndeveloping  transport  requires  innovative  approaches  that  enhance  the  multisector  and \nmultipurpose dimensions of infrastructure investment. The Project\u2019s roadside stations31 will link \nroads with community activities and encourage safe driving. Roadside stations normally provide \nparking areas and ancillary facilities such as bus terminals; gasoline stations; information centers \nabout roads, road safety, and tourism; local specialty markets; restaurants; and agro-processing \nfacilities. Details of facilities will be firmed up during project implementation. The Project will \ndevelop roadside stations along the project local roads. \n \n                                                           \n30 The application of the information technology to transport is referred to as ITS, which provides the ability to gather, \norganize, analyze, use, and share information about transport systems and their efficient use. ITS for developing \ncountries was prepared by the World Bank (World Bank. 2004. ITS for Developing Countries. ITS Technical Note 1. \nWashington, DC) and will be used as a guide. \n31 The concept of roadside stations was developed in Japan to link road users and communities, thereby facilitating \nlocal economic development. They are different from ordinary service areas because they (i) are designed with the \ninvolvement of local communities; (ii) link road users and local communities; (iii) provide business opportunities for \nlocal people; and (iv) can provide possible public services, including health care, education, and cultural activities, in \naddition to the normal restaurant and commercial services. SPCD will use the World Bank\u2019s Guidelines for Roadside \nStations. \n ", "10 \n27.  Stakeholder Consultations. During the feasibility study, EIA, resettlement planning, and \nTA implementation, consultations were conducted with 4,200 representatives of local government \nagencies, civil society, and project-affected people to discuss project alternatives, environmental \nconcerns, land acquisition and resettlement issues, and economic development potential. The \nconsultations indicated that local residents supported the Project because they would have better \naccess to jobs, markets, and social services. These processes enabled local stakeholders to \nexpress their opinions, including on alignment selection, resettlement, and compensation, and to \nmake suggestions to improve project design and implementation (Appendix 7). \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n28.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $2,077 million, with a foreign exchange cost of \n$931 million (45%) and a local currency cost of $1,146 million (55%). The total costs include \nphysical contingencies, price contingencies, and interest and other charges during construction. \nDetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 8. \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n      Foreign    Local      Total \nItems  Exchange   Currency     Cost \nA.

The loan will have a 26-year term, including a grace period of 6 years, \nan interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The loan will finance about 64% of \nthe foreign exchange cost of the Project and 29% of the total project cost. The remaining foreign \nexchange cost will be financed by the Sichuan provincial government (SPG). The local currency \ncost will be financed by MOC, SPG, and cofinancing through a loan from the China Development \nBank, which has issued a commitment letter to SPCD. MOC and SPG have made budgetary \nprovisions for the counterpart funds. The loan from the China Development Bank is repayable over \n26 years, including a grace period of 6 years, and at a lending rate at 5.76% per annum. The ADB \n ", "11 \nloan proceeds will be made available to SPG, and through SPG, to the Project Company on the \nsame financial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n30.  Project Management. As the Executing Agency, SPCD will be responsible for the overall \nimplementation of the Project. Part of SPCD has been corporatized to form the Project Company \nto be the Project\u2019s Implementing Agency. A project director will be responsible for overall project \nmanagement, approval of contracts, and payments while a project manager is responsible for the \ndaily physical implementation and for the preparation of progress reports. The Project Company \nwill have sufficient technical capability to handle the Project as its engineers will have experience \nin implementing internationally financed road projects. The financial management assessment of \nSPCD shows that the Project will have in place an adequate financial management system. The \nfinancial management assessment questionnaire (Supplementary Appendix E) was completed by \nthe  SPCD.  Organization  charts  for  SPCD  and  the  Project  Company  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix F. \n \n31.  Period of Implementation. The Project will be implemented over about 6 years, from \nApril 2006 to September 2011 (Appendix 9). \n \n32.  Procurement. All ADB-financed procurement will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. The civil works for the expressway and the local roads will be divided \ninto 20 packages to be procured through international competitive bidding. Equipment packages \nwill be procured under domestic financing through local competitive bidding for traffic engineering, \ntunnel monitoring and emergency systems, communications and toll plaza systems, and road \nmaintenance. Ancillary buildings, and facilities and roadside greening will be procured through \nlocal  competitive  bidding  using  domestic  financing  (Appendix  10).  A  well-qualified  tendering \ncompany will handle international competitive bidding. \n \n33.  Consulting Services. Construction supervision activities, involving 5,520 person-months \nof consulting services, will be undertaken by domestic consulting teams, headed by a chief \nsupervision  engineer,  under  government  financing  and  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with \ngovernment procedures. Besides construction supervision, domestic consultants for a project \nperformance management system (PPMS), including the monitoring of the social development \naction plan, will be engaged. \n \n34.  The Project will provide 66 person-months of international consulting services to (i) help \nwith  project  management  during  construction,  (ii) provide  expertise  in  tunnel  and  bridge \n ", "12 \nconstruction, (iii) conduct a safety audit of the project design and make safety recommendations \non the completed construction works, (iv) help set up and implement quality control procedures, \n(v) monitor  the  environmental  impact  of  the  project  and  provide  guidance  on  environmental \nmitigation measures as well as help develop capacity in vehicle emissions, (vi) help formulate a \ncapacity development program, and (vii) help establish and implement a PPMS. The team leader \nwill be in the field during construction and act as assistant chief supervision engineer, (i) helping \nthe  chief  supervision  engineer  certify  variation  orders,  contractor\u2019s  monthly  payments,  and \nsubcontracting  documents;  and  (ii) helping  establish  a  contract  management  system.  All \nconsultants to be financed under the ADB loan will be selected and engaged based on the \nquality- and cost-based selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants by the Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers. Outline terms of reference for \nconsultants are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n35.  Advance  Action.  Given  the  high  priority  accorded  to  the  Project  and  the  need  to \ncommence works in April 2006, ADB approved advance procurement action for civil works. 32 \nAdvance action covers the prequalification of contractors, bidding, and bid evaluation, but not \ncontract awards. The advance action will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. The Government has been advised that approval of the advance action does not \ncommit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n36.  Disbursement Arrangements. All disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Since most payments will be made for \nlarge contracts well above $100,000, direct payment and commitment procedures will be used to \nwithdraw the loan funds. If the government funds are used first for eligible expenditures, ADB's \nreimbursement procedure will be used. Statement of expenditures will be applied to reimburse \neligible expenditures for any individual payment not exceeding $100,000, to expedite fund flow. \n \n37.  Accounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting. The Project Company will maintain separate \naccounts for the Project and related financial statements and will have them audited annually in \naccordance with appropriate auditing standards consistently applied by independent auditors, \nwhose qualifications, experience, and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB. The Project \nCompany will submit to ADB within 6 months of the end of each related fiscal year, certified \ncopies of audited project accounts and financial statements and an auditor\u2019s report on the Project, \nall in English. A separate audit opinion on the use of the statement of expenditures, if any, will be \nincluded as part of the auditor\u2019s report. During project implementation, the Project Company will \nsubmit quarterly progress reports. To facilitate project postevaluation, the Project Company will \nfurnish to ADB a completion report within 3 months of the end of the Project. \n \n38.  Project  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation. To demonstrate the development \neffectiveness of its operations and to be accountable for its performance to stakeholders, ADB \nuses the PPMS.33 For this purpose, a set of indicators for evaluating project performance in \nrelation to the project impact, outcomes, and outputs has been agreed on with SPCD. These \nindicators will be refined at the start of project implementation and may include (i) economic \ndevelopment and poverty indicators for the project area, (ii) industrial and agricultural outputs, \n(iii) transport  costs  and  time,  (iv) transport  services  and  charges,  (v) accident  rates, \n                                                           \n32 Advance action was reported in the March 2005 internet edition of ADB Business Opportunities. \n33 The PPMS comprises five components: design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1), project performance report, \ngovernment monitoring and evaluation, project completion report, and project performance audit report. Through TA, \nADB seeks to develop a county poverty monitoring system that provides timely, relevant, and high-quality information \nuseful for poverty-related analysis of ADB-financed transport projects. \n ", "13 \n(vi) accessibility by roads and buses in the project area, and (vii) and jobs created in construction \nand maintenance. Employment impact indicators will include information about unskilled laborers, \npoor laborers, and women laborers, and will be monitored through an annual report. At the \nbeginning of project implementation, the Project Company will establish a baseline and target \nvalues for the indicators. The indicators will be measured at project completion and 3 years later, \nand will be compared with the baseline. A report summarizing the key findings will be submitted to \nADB. A full-time staff member of the Project Company will be designated to undertake monitoring \nand evaluation with the consultants. \n \n39.  Project Review. In 2008, SPCD, the Project Company, and ADB will carry out a midterm \nreview  of  the  Project,  covering  all  institutional,  administrative,  organizational,  technical, \nenvironmental, social, poverty reduction, resettlement, economic, financial, and other relevant \naspects that may have an impact on the Project\u2019s performance and continuing viability. \n \n40.  Anticorruption  Measures.  The  Government  has  made  significant  efforts  to  stop \ncorruption in the road sector. To date, 15 government officials from 10 provincial communications \ndepartments34 have  been  found  to  be  involved  in  corruption.  Information  related  to  these \ncorruption cases is in the public domain. There is no evidence that any of the reported corruption \nwas related to ADB-financed road projects,35 according to the China National Audit Office. During \nproject processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local government \nofficials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added to ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, particularly the need for \nbidders, suppliers, contractors, and consultants to observe the highest standards of ethics in the \nprocurement and execution of ADB-financed contracts, and the sanctions if fraud and corruption \nare discovered. \n \n41.  Based on the Project Company\u2019s experience in fighting corruption, the following actions \nwill be taken to prevent corruption in the Project: (i) officials from the Discipline and Inspection \nBureau will be resident in project offices for bidding, construction, and operations; (ii) an internal \naudit unit will be established in the Project Company; (iii) a two-contract system will be adopted, \nwhere the winner of a civil works contract must also sign an anticorruption contract with the \nemployer; (iv) liaison meetings between SPCD and the Prosecutor's Office will be initiated to \ndiscuss warnings about or information on corrupt practices; and (v) contractors will be periodically \nreviewed to ensure that fund withdrawal and settlement procedures are being followed. \n \n42.  Capacity Building. Based on the TA findings, SPCD and the Project Company need to \ndevelop their capacity to manage sector development and expressway operations effectively and \nefficiently  to  cope  with  increased  road  construction  and  management  activities.  A  human \nresource development plan will be drawn up with the help of the international consultants. The \nplan will consider the staff needs determined based on a survey on the skill level in key areas, \nand the recruitment and training requirements identified. It will include 53 person-months of \ninternational  training,  covering  expressway  commercialization,  highway  operations  and \nmanagement,  tunnel  operation  and  management,  intelligent  transport  system,  financial \nmanagement, highway maintenance and asset management, tunnel construction and technology, \ntraffic engineering and road safety, and construction risk management. Findings from the training \nwill be disseminated in Sichuan through an institute. The Project Company will, with the help of \n                                                           \n34 Anhui, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Henan, Hunan, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Xinjiang, and Yunnan. \n35 Road projects in Hebei Province and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region were investigated by ADB to detect and \nprevent corruption. The investigation found no conclusive evidence that these projects had involved any fraud or \ncorruption. \n ", "14 \nthe international consultants, develop a 50 person-month training program through the Sichuan \nCommunications and Technology Management College to enhance the local communications \nbureau staff\u2019s capacity and skills in road maintenance and traffic management and thus ensure \nsustainable operation of the local road component. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Traffic Forecast \n \n43.  The traffic volume on the existing roads in the project area has been increasing at about \n10% per annum in the last 5 years. The roads are already at capacity in certain sections. If the \nnew road is not constructed, traffic growth will be suppressed and transport costs will increase. \nCongested  traffic  will  slow  the  project  area\u2019s  economic  growth.  Based  on  the  TA  findings \n(footnote 3), traffic volume on the expressway is forecast to grow from 10,615 pcu per day in \n2011 to 20,495 pcu per day in 2021, a 6.8% average annual growth rate. It will then grow more \nslowly at 5.8% per annum to reach 34,043 pcu in 2030 (Appendix 11). \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n \n44.  To meet growing transport demand in the project area, an alternative analysis reviewed \nvarious options for transport modes, alignments, technical designs, timing of investments, and \nfinancing modalities as part of the national and provincial transport network plan. The conclusion \nwas to improve road transport by constructing an expressway supported by complementary local \nroad improvement. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated by comparing \nsituations with and without the Project. Without the Project, the traffic volume would exceed the \noptimum capacity of the existing National Highway 108, which would become congested, thereby \nincreasing travel time, vehicle operating costs (VOCs), and the number of accidents. With the \nProject, travel time would be reduced by higher speeds and shorter distance; VOCs would be \nreduced by faster and smoother travel on the expressway; and the accident rate would be \nreduced by elimination of congestion, provision of safety features, and separation of fast- and \nslow-moving traffic. If local roads are not upgraded, people in the remote parts of the project area \nwill have less mobility, and the mainly poor inhabitants will not be able to participate in the \nmainstream of economic activities. The economic costs of the expressway reflect the resource \ncosts for construction, O&M, and the value of agricultural production from land lost permanently. \nThe economic benefits generated by the expressway include (i) savings in VOCs as a result of \nreduced road length and improved traffic conditions, (ii) time savings for road users, (iii) savings \nfrom avoided accidents, (iv) benefits from generated traffic, and (v) traffic diversion from rail. The \nbenefits from the local roads were estimated from reduced VOCs and producer surplus (the value \nof additional production minus production costs). \n \n45.  The project EIRR is estimated at 15.2%, indicating that the Project is economically viable \n(Appendix 12). Results of sensitivity analysis confirm the robustness of the Project's economic \nviability. Changes in the key variables, such as a 10% reduction in benefits, do not significantly \nimpact on economic viability. The capital cost would have to increase by 61% from the estimate \nfor the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. The benefit level would have to decrease by 38% \nto achieve the same effect. In light of experience in the PRC road sector, variations of such \nmagnitude are unlikely. The EIRR was calculated separately for the expressway (15.2%) and for \nlocal roads (15.9%). The economic analysis was extended to cover the distribution of project net \nbenefits  by  determining  the  project  effects  for  various  beneficiaries,  including  road  users \n(passengers and freight), labor, and the government. Road users will receive the largest share of \nnet benefits, accounting for 93% of the total net benefits (Appendix 12). \n ", "15 \nC.  Financial Analysis and Projections \n \n46.  The  proposed  toll  rates36 for  the  expressway  are  considered  reasonable  to  attract \nsufficient  traffic  to  meet  the  criteria  for  economic  and  financial  rate  of  return.  The  Project \nCompany will undertake a toll analysis before opening the expressway, and each year for 5 years \nthereafter,  to  confirm  the  appropriate  level  of  toll,  and  it  will  submit  the  results  for  ADB\u2019s \nconcurrence. If an adjustment of the toll levels is required based on this principle, the Project \nCompany  will  submit  its  toll  adjustment  plans  for  ADB\u2019s  concurrence  before  finalizing  and \nsubmitting it to SPG for approval. \n \n47.  Financial projections have been prepared for the Project Company in accordance with \nADB's  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects \nFinanced by ADB to assess the financial viability and sustainability of the Project (Appendix 13). \nThe projected financial statements indicate that financial revenues will be sufficient to cover O&M \ncosts,  income  taxes,  and  debt  service.  Incremental  costs  and  revenues  were  derived  by \nevaluating the financial position of the Project Company. A financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \nfor the expressway, computed after taxes, is 5.4%. This compares favorably with the weighted \naverage cost of capital of 3.9%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the FIRR is robust under \nadverse conditions. Based on the financial projections and financial evaluation of the expressway \ncomponent, the Project is considered financially viable and sustainable (Appendix 13). \n \nD.  Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n \n48.  The population in the project area is 938,930 (814,310 rural and 124,620 urban). Of the \ntotal rural population, 252,200 people (31%) are poor (annual per capita income of less than \nCNY900). Of the total urban population, 20,800 people (17%) are urban poor (less than the \nminimum standard of living), resulting in a 29% overall poverty incidence. A summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 14, and a full poverty reduction and social strategy is \nin Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n49.  Most of the project area is mountainous. The productive environment in these areas is \npoor due to difficult topography, low soil fertility, and difficult climate, leading to low agricultural \nproductivity. The situation is exacerbated by remoteness and poor road access, which, in turn, \nhave led to weak social infrastructure, including agricultural extension, health, and education. As \na  consequence,  off-farm  incomes  are  essential  to  reduce  poverty.  The Project  will  improve \naccess to such opportunities within the project area and beyond while stimulating agricultural \nproduction. Road development is, however, necessary but not sufficient to facilitate growth and \nreduce poverty. Therefore, a set of complementary activities to enhance the Project\u2019s positive \nimpacts and to minimize its possible negative impacts has been agreed on with SPCD and \nincluded in a social development action plan (SDAP) (Supplementary Appendix I). The activities, \nwhich target poor villages and households, include (i) public consultation, (ii) resettlement and \nincome recovery of the population affected by the expressway, (iii) prevention of the spread of \nHIV/AIDS,37 (iv) enhancement of poverty reduction impacts, and (v) tourism promotion. \n \n                                                           \n36 The proposed toll rates are CNY0.35\u2013CNY1.40 per vehicle-km. To reduce the burden of the toll charges on the low-\nincome local residents, local vehicles carrying fresh agricultural produce or livestock are exempt from tolls. The poor \nlocal residents, who may not directly use the project expressway, will indirectly benefit from the reduction in freight \nrates and passenger fares by 10% by 2015. \n37 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n ", "16 \n50.  The project area has 157,000 members of ethnic minorities (17% of the total population). \nOver  85%  are  in  Shimian  and  Mianning  counties;  86%  are  Yi.  Their  social  and  economic \nconditions have improved significantly in recent years primarily because of (i) better agricultural \nproductivity, (ii) increased demand for labor from urban areas and local enterprises, and (iii) \nenhanced  physical  and  social  infrastructure  resulting  from  concerted  poverty  reduction  and \nminority development programs. Most of the minority population will directly benefit from the \nProject, either as residents of villages targeted by the local road component or of townships \ncrossed by the expressway. The Project is therefore seen as having a significant impact on the \ndevelopment of the minority population, and hence is an indigenous people category-A project. \nAn ethnic minorities development plan (EMDP) has been prepared in line with ADB\u2019s policy on \nindigenous peoples, including, for example, protection of minority communities from construction \ndisturbances, control of HIV/AIDS, provision of microcredit to rural women, and afforestation (see \nAppendix  15  for  a  summary  EMDP  and  Supplementary  Appendix  J  for  a  full  one).  The \nresettlement impact of ethnic minorities is addressed in the resettlement plan. \n \n51.  In Sichuan, 3,258 people were infected with HIV as of June 2004, and in Liangshan \nPrefecture, 1,441. The Sichuan Provincial Health Department, especially through its centers for \ndisease control (CDCs), has been regularly conducting various activities to prevent HIV/AIDS as \nwell as to promote overall health and hygienic standards and prevent other diseases. Specific \nproject-based activities receive international assistance, such as PRC\u2013United Kingdom HIV/AIDS \nPrevention  and  Care  Project  funded  by  the  United  Kingdom.  The  CDCs  regularly  inspect \nconstruction  sites  to  control  HIV/AIDS,  malaria,  and  other  diseases,  and  to  keep  hygienic \nstandards, including for food. To prevent the risk of HIV/AIDS associated with the Project, the \nCDCs  agreed  to  extend  their  preventive  measures  to  the  communities  along  the  Project, \nparticularly construction sites, including provision of HIV test kits, contraceptives, education, \nposters,  leaflets,  and  regular  services  such  as  monitoring  and  surveillance,  focusing  on \nconstruction workers. In carrying out the civil works contracts, the Implementation Methods of \nEpidemic Prevention Law will be followed. \n \nE.  Environmental Assessment \n \n52.  This is an environmental category-A project. An EIA for the expressway was prepared by \nSPCD, and an environmental assessment of the local roads was prepared by the TA consultants. \nA summary EIA for the Project was prepared and circulated to the Board and made public \nthrough ADB's website on 24 February 2005. To ensure that all potential adverse environmental \nimpacts of project design, construction, and operation are mitigated, SPCD will implement the \nenvironmental management plan (EMP), including a monitoring program, mitigation measures, \ninstitutional arrangements, and budgeting as specified in the EIA. The project expressway will \npass through the experimental zone of Liziping Nature Reserve, based on the feasibility study, \nwhere multiple land uses are allowed. Potential environmental impacts on the reserve area will be \nminimized by implementing the EMP, which will be incorporated into the bidding documents and \ncontracts of civil works. \n \nF.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n53.  The Project will affect five counties: Yucheng, Yingjing, Hanyuan, and Shimian in Ya\u2019an \nmunicipality;  and  Mianning  in  Liangshan  Prefecture.  Based  on  the  feasibility  study,  1,466 \nhectares (ha) will be acquired, 56% of which is farmland, comprising paddy (21%) and dry land \n(35%). The remaining 44% is forestland, fruit trees, housing plots, and wasteland. Approximately \n348 ha will be occupied temporarily during construction. The farmland acquisition is equivalent to \nthe complete loss of farmland for 20,237 people. Along with land acquisition, about 94,800 square \n ", "17 \nmeters of houses will be demolished, requiring the relocation of 790 households or 2,634 people, \nmost to a site close to their village, and allowing housing improvement. \n \n54.  This is an involuntary resettlement category-A project. SPCD has conducted a social \nimpact  assessment  and  prepared  a  resettlement  plan  (see  Appendix  16  for  a  summary \nresettlement plan, and Supplementary Appendix K for a full one). Consultations have been held \nwith local officials, village leaders, and project-affected households to minimize impacts on towns, \nvillages, and high-yield paddy and fruit gardens. To mitigate impacts on incomes and livelihoods \nof project-affected people, higher-than-average compensation has been proposed, and various \nrehabilitation  strategies  have  been  prepared.  The  local  government  is  responsible  for \nimplementing  the  resettlement  plan,  but  the  village  and  group  leaders  will  take  the  key \nimplementation  decisions  and  actions  concerning  livelihood  and  income  rehabilitation.  The \nresettlement plan was distributed to local officials, and the resettlement information booklet was \ndisseminated to project-affected people in February 2005. A revised resettlement plan based on \npreliminary design will be required before 31 October 2005, which provides updated impacts by \nvillage, rehabilitation plans for villages seriously affected by the Project, and special measures to \nsupport  households  that  face  hardship.  In  addition,  before  civil  works  start,  a  detailed \nmeasurement survey based on detailed design will be completed, providing an inventory list of \nproject-affected assets. Upon completion of the survey for the project expressway and local road \ncomponents, SPCD will submit the updated resettlement plan with any modifications to ADB \nbefore civil works start. \n \nG.  Risks \n \n55.  The Project was formulated to reduce potential technical, economic, financial, and social \nrisks. The main technical risks are associated with the tunnel (34.5 km in total) and bridges (64.0 \nkm in total). To mitigate the risks, international consultants reviewed the proposed design and \nconstruction methods. Prequalification of contractors focuses on their financial and technical \ncapability to handle complex works. During construction, monitoring and contract management \ninformation systems will be set up and implemented, with the assistance of the international \nconsultants,  for  timely  identification  of  technical  problems  and  implementation  of  corrective \nmeasures. SPCD has experience, and has shown satisfactory performance, in implementing \ninternationally financed projects. Economic performance in the project-influenced area would \nhave to deteriorate substantially for the Project to lose its economic viability. The financial risks \nassociated with construction and operation of the expressway will depend on the level and \ncomposition of traffic, construction costs, ability of the commercial management, and appropriate \ntolls. To mitigate the financial risks, the Project Company will build up a commercial business \nenvironment for expressway operations, the project expressway will receive substantial equity \nfrom  the  government,  and  an  appropriate  toll  structure  will  be  adopted.  For  a  project  that \ngenerates revenue in domestic currency, a risk is related to exchange rate changes and is partly \naccounted for in the base case calculations. An adverse exchange rate change of 30% would \nhave only a small effect on the financial return. The social risks include resettlement, HIV/AIDS \ninfection, and ethnic minority communities associated with the Project. Appropriate mitigation \nmeasures are in place in the resettlement plan, EMDP, and social action development plan. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n56.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, SPG, and SPCD have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n ", "18 \n \n57.  Construction Quality. The Project Company will ensure that the Project expressway is \nconstructed in accordance with 2004 technical standards of MOC for highway engineering. The \ninternational consultant designated as the team leader and assistant chief supervision engineer \nwill  review  and  help  the  chief  supervision  engineer  certify  variation  orders  and  contractors\u2019 \nmonthly payments before submission to the chief supervision engineer. \n \n58.  Road Safety. Before project construction and operations, the Project Company will carry \nout  road  safety  audits,  the  recommendations  of  which  will  be  implemented  before  project \nconstruction and operations. For the project expressway, SPCD and the Project Company will \nimplement the road safety signage, communications, hazard barriers, traffic monitoring, and \nvehicle weighing in accordance with MOC regulations and other regulations and standards. The \nProject Company will cooperate closely with the Sichuan Public Security Bureau to implement \nroad safety measures. Before the project expressway opens, SPCD will submit a report on the \nemergency response plan to ADB for review. \n \n59.  Roadside Stations. Before completion of the local roads under the Project, SPCD will \nestablish  roadside  stations  to  facilitate  community  development  by  linking  such  roads  with \ncommunity activities. Facilities to be provided at the roadside stations may include parking areas; \nbus  terminals;  gasoline  stations;  information  centers  about  roads,  road  safety,  tourism,  and \nHIV/AIDS; local specialty markets; restaurants; and agroprocessing facilities. \n \n60.  Corporate Governance. SPCD and the Project Company will enter into a concession \nframework agreement by 31 December 2007 to ensure autonomy of operations, encourage the \nestablishment of road performance indicators, and facilitate refinancing of road sector assets. The \nProject Company will prepare a corporate development plan by 31 December 2007 to assure \nhigh standards of corporate governance, management practices, and financial reporting. \n \n61.  Private Sector Development. Six months before the project facilities open, SPG through \nthe Project Company will analyze the feasibility of attracting private sector investment funds for \nfuture  road  sector  investment,  including  private  sector  participation  in  O&M  of  the  project \nexpressway, and report its conclusions to ADB. \n \n62.  Tolls. The tolls for the Project expressway will be set will be set by SPG. In determining \nthe toll level, SPG will take into consideration the levels sufficient to satisfy the Project Company\u2019s \nminimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.2. Six months before the expressway opens, SPCD \nthrough the Project Company will seek ADB\u2019s concurrence on the proposed toll structure and \nlevels before seeking SPG approval. For the first 5 years of operation, SPCD through the Project \nCompany will annually review the toll structure and levels, and submit a report to ADB. SPCD \nthrough the Project Company will seek ADB\u2019s concurrence on toll level adjustment before seeking \nSPG approval. \n \n63.  Financial Ratios. To ensure financial sustainability, the Project Company will maintain \n(i) a debt\u2013equity ratio of not more than 55:45 from the third year of full operation; (ii) a working \nratio (annual O&M cost, but excluding periodic maintenance cost, to revenue) of not more than \n15%; and (iii) a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.2 from the third year of full \noperation. \n \n64.  Capacity  Building.  The  Project  Company  in  consultation  with  SPCD  will  prepare  a \nhuman  resource  development  plan.  Before  undertaking  international  training,  the  Project \nCompany will prepare for ADB\u2019s concurrence a training plan, a program of workshops to be \n ", "19 \ndelivered  at  the  Project  Company  by  people  trained  internationally,  and  a  list  of  training \nequipment and aids to strengthen the Project Company\u2019s domestic training programs. \n \n65.  Environment. SPCD and the Project Company will ensure that the Project is designed, \nconstructed, and operated in accordance with government rules and regulations and ADB\u2019s policy \non environment (2002). SPCD and the Project Company will implement the EMP set out in the \nEIA,  which  will  be  approved  by  the  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration  prior  to \ncompletion  of  the  preliminary  design,  and  the  summary  EIA  to  mitigate  any  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  arising  from  the  Project,  and  submit  a  semiannual  report  to  ADB; \nmitigation measures will be incorporated into the bidding documents and civil works contracts. \n \n66.  Vehicle Emissions. SPG will (i) provide to ADB the national emission standards and the \npenalties  for  infringement  of  such  standards,  and  (ii) ensure  that  Sichuan  Environmental \nProtection Bureau, Sichuan Public Security Bureau, and other agencies enforce the national \nvehicle emission standards, and fulfill the requirements of the government strategies, at least 6 \nmonths before the opening of the expressway. \n \n67.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. SPG and SPCD will ensure through the Project \nCompany that land acquisition and resettlement are carried out promptly and efficiently following \nthe resettlement plan agreed on with ADB, in line with the Land Administration Law and ADB's \npolicies on involuntary resettlement (1995) and indigenous peoples (1998). SPG and SPCD will \nensure through the Project Company that implementation of the resettlement plan is monitored \nand evaluated and reported to ADB as required in the plan. \n \n68.  Ethnic Minorities. SPCD and local governments will implement the EMDP to ensure that \nethnic minorities benefit from the Project at least equitably and in accordance with ADB's policy \non indigenous peoples (1998), and that implementation of the EMDP be monitored and evaluated \nby an independent agency. \n \n69.  Poverty Reduction. The Government will cause SPG to implement the SDAP in a timely \nmanner. The Project Company will cause the contractors to maximize the employment of local \npoor people who meet the job and efficiency requirements for construction of the project roads. \nSuch workers will be trained on the job. The Government will cause SPG to extend the coverage \nand quality of public utilities, basic health, and basic education in the project area to enhance the \nProject\u2019s  poverty  reduction  impacts.  The  Poverty  Alleviation  Office,  in  consultation  with  the \nProject Company, will monitor the impacts on poverty with the assistance of a designated local \ninstitute based on a set of indicators as outlined in the SDAP, and will submit annual monitoring \nreports to ADB. \n \n70.  Labor  Standards.  SPCD  through  the  Project  Company  will  ensure  that  civil  works \ncontractors  comply  with  all  applicable  labor  legislation.  Bidding  documents  and  civil  works \ncontracts will include clauses, prohibiting child labor for construction and maintenance activities, \nensuring equal pay for men and women for work of equal value, and requiring a timely payment \nfor workers on a monthly basis. The compliance will be monitored by the Project Company. \n \n71.  Gender and Development. SPCD and the Project Company will ensure implementation \nof the project in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on gender and development (1998). SPCD shall \nensure  the  effective  implementation  of  measures  aimed  at  increasing  project  benefits  and \nimpacts on women in the project areas, which are included in the EMDP and SDAP. \n \n \n ", "20 \n72.  Health Risks. The Department of Health and the Project Company, together with the \nappropriate  authorities,  will  ensure  that  contractors  disseminate  information  on  the  risks  of \nHIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections to those employed during project implementation. \nThe Department of Health and SPCD will also ensure that similar information is disseminated to \ntransport operators and local communities such as ethnic minorities, women, and other high-risk \ngroups living in the project area during project operation, at roadside stations, and other suitable \nfacilities.  SPCD  will  cause  contractors  to  monitor  health  risk  control  according  to  the \nImplementation Methods of Epidemic Prevention Law of the PRC (1991). \n \n73.  Axle  Loads.  SPCD  through  the  Project  Company  will  install  vehicle  axle-weighing \nequipment at selected entry points. Before opening the project expressway, the Project Company \nwill submit to ADB the plan for operation of the vehicle weigh stations, including the prescribed \naxle-load limits and penalties for infringement. \n \n74.  Change in Ownership. If any change in ownership of the project facilities, or any sale, \ntransfer,  or  assignment  of  SPCD\u2019s  interest  in  the  project  expressway  is  anticipated,  the \nGovernment, SPG, and the Project Company will consult ADB at least 6 months before the \nchange. \n \n75.  Anticorruption Measures. SPCD through the Project Company will ensure that ADB\u2019s \nand the Government\u2019s anticorruption policy will be followed. SPCD through the Project Company \nwill also ensure, in accordance with the Government\u2019s regulations and requirements, during project \nimplementation that (i) officials from the Discipline and Inspection Bureau will be resident in project \noffices for bidding, construction, and operations; (ii) an internal audit unit will be established in the \nProject Company; (iii) a two-contract system will be adopted where the winner of a civil works \ncontract must also sign an anticorruption contract with the employer; and (iv)  periodic inspection of \ncontractors will be undertaken to ensure that fund withdrawal and settlement procedures are \nfollowed. SPCD will initiate liaison meetings with the Prosecutor's Office, on a needed basis, to \ndiscuss warnings about or information on corrupt practices. \n \nB.  Condition for Disbursement \n \n76.

Road Network \n \n1.  The road network of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) was 1.86 million kilometers \n(km) in 2004, an increase of 46,000 km from 2003. Of this, 1.44 million km were classified. \nRoads of class II and above accounted for 287,000 km, 15.3% of the total length. Road density \nhas increased from 12.1 km per 100 square km (km2) in 1995 to 19.4 km per 100 km2 in 2004. \nIn 2004, Sichuan\u2019s road network accounted for 6.1% of the country\u2019s total, with a length of \n113,043 km. Of this, 76,401 km (67.6 %) was classified: 1,758 km, expressways (1.6%); 1,496 \nkm, class I (1.3%); 9,633 km, class II (8.5%); and 63,514 km, of classes III and IV (56.2%). \nUnclassified roads amounted to 36,642 km (32.4%). Road density in Sichuan was 23.3 km per \n100 km2, slightly higher than the national average, but the proportion of roads under class II and \nabove is significantly lower. \n \n2.  The  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific \n(UNESCAP) is promoting a transregional Asian highway network, extending 140,000 km, of \nwhich 26,000 km are in the PRC. Road projects funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nare helping develop this network through a total of 13 completed or planned projects comprising \n2,100 km, with a total loan amount of about $2.4 billion. \n  \nB.  Vehicle Fleet and Traffic \n \n3.  In 2003, the PRC vehicle fleet totaled 24 million trucks, cars, and buses, and 72 million \nother motorized vehicles (motorcycles and agricultural vehicles). The privately owned fleet of \nmotor vehicles increased more than 20 times during 1985\u20132003, from 0.3 million vehicles to \n12.0 million. Despite the rapid increase in total vehicles, there are only about 1.3 vehicles per \n100 people, which is lower than in other Asian countries. The PRC\u2019s accession to the World \nTrade Organization has increased investment in the automobile industry, reduced the tariffs on \nimported vehicles, and contributed to easing motor vehicle financing. These factors, plus rapidly \ngrowing urban incomes, underpin the growth in road traffic. The modernization of the vehicle \nfleet will improve vehicle safety and reduce individual vehicles\u2019 fuel consumption and their \nemissions. In 2003, the number of vehicles registered in Sichuan was 734,200 passenger \nvehicles and 392,600 freight vehicles. Vehicle ownership in Sichuan is lower than the national \naverage.  Privately  owned  vehicles  totaled  670,200.  Road  passenger  traffic  in  Sichuan \nmeasured in terms of passenger-km of travel grew by more than 33% in 2000\u20132003, reaching \n47.7 billion passenger-km. Road freight traffic, in ton-km, grew by 35% during the same period. \n \nC.  Road Administration \n \n4.  The  Sichuan  Provincial  Communications  Department  (SPCD)  is  responsible  for \nregulating the road transport industry by licensing intercity bus services. Freight transport is \nessentially deregulated; however, interprovincial bus routes require Ministry of Communications \n(MOC) approval. Because of trucking reforms, private operations have increased, improving \ntransport efficiency and quality of services and increasing competition. ADB is supporting this \nprocess through a technical assistance (TA),1 which aims to help improve the performance of \nthe road transport industry by formulating policy reforms in road freight and passenger services. \nRoad administration is decentralized. Road transport tariffs are allowed within a range of plus or \nminus 20% of advisory tariffs set by the local government. This flexibility, coupled with ease of \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

", "26  Appendix 2 \nmarket entry, will facilitate the passing on to transport users of cost reductions resulting from \nimproved road conditions. \n \nD.  Road Sector Revenue and Expenditures \n5.  Expenditures  in  highway  infrastructure  are  financed  from  dedicated  user  charges, \ngovernment grants, domestic bank loans and bonds, and foreign loans and investments. Two \ndedicated user charges, the road maintenance fee and vehicle purchase fee, have provided \nmuch of the financing for the road sector. During the Ninth Five-Year Plan of 1996\u20132000, the \nroad maintenance fee and vehicle purchase fee provided 53% and 13%, respectively, of the \ntotal road investments. Government grants provided 2%, mainly to construct or improve rural \nroads  in  poor  areas.  The  rest  was  financed  from  domestic  loans  and  bonds  (9%);  other \ndomestic investments, including financing from local governments and state-owned enterprises \n(12%); foreign loans (8%); and foreign direct investment (3%). \n \n6.  As  part  of  a  tax  reform  to  bring  off-budget  revenue  and  expenditures  within  the \nframework of the national budget, the National People\u2019s Congress amended the Highway Law \non 31 October 1999, laying the foundation for legislation providing for national taxes to replace \nprovincial and local fees. The vehicle purchase fee was replaced by the vehicle purchase tax \neffective January 2001, and a fuel tax is being considered to replace the road maintenance fee. \nBased on findings of an ADB-financed TA,2 the fuel tax is likely to improve financing of the road \nsector.  \n \n7.  SPCD invested about CNY16.2 billion in the road sector in 2004: CNY12.9 billion for \nconstruction and CNY1.4 billion for maintenance. During the 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005), \ntotal investment is expected to be about CNY71 billion, with an annual average growth rate of \n5.0% during this period. SPCD plans to increase road investment to CNY78 billion during the \n11th Five-Year Plan. \n \nE.  Road Engineering, Construction, and Maintenance \n \n8.  Road  projects  are  designed  by  planning  and  design  institutes  at  the  provincial, \nprefecture, and county levels. MOC reviews the designs of expressways, high-standard roads, \nand  associated  structures.  Design  institutes  are  staffed  with  experienced,  well-qualified \npersonnel. The city and county highway bureaus have their own construction units to carry out \nminor projects within their administrative districts. Drawing on the experience gained under \nADB- and World Bank-financed projects, competitive bidding practices were mandated by the \n1999 Tendering and Bidding Law.3 Many of the largest provincial and urban construction units \nare being reorganized into financially independent companies and have been awarded contracts \nindividually or as partners in joint ventures on several ADB- and World Bank-financed in-country \nor overseas projects. \n \n9.  Road maintenance is well organized by the expressway companies and the highway \nadministration bureaus and is carried out mainly through labor-intensive operations but with \nincreasing  amounts  of  mechanized  works.  Although  maintenance  expenditures  increased \nsignificantly in absolute terms in the past decade and maintenance is generally adequate, \nmaintenance expenditures has not increased as a percentage of total road expenditures. In \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1998. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Regional Road Sector Study.

", "Appendix 2  27\nrural areas, there is a strong tradition of community self-help: local residents spend several days \nmaintaining the low-class roads, ensuring a high level of awareness of the need for adequate \nmaintenance,  and  pressure  on  the  local  governments  to  maintain  an  acceptable  level  of \nserviceability. Thus, maintenance standards in rural areas are responsive to public pressure \nwhere there is a strong tradition of public accountability. This is less effective in towns where \nsuch issues tend to be media-led and do not normally result in sustained pressure.4 \n \nF.  Government\u2019s Rural Road Development Program \n \n10.  MOC has prepared the National Rural Road Development Plan, under which rural roads \nwill be developed in three stages. By 2005, rural roads will make up 1.55 million km; by 2010, \n1.85 million km,  connecting  all  townships  and  administrative  villages;  and  by  2020, \n2.5 million km, and transport services will be provided to administrative village level. MOC plans \nto invest CNY100 billion in rural roads from 2006 to 2010. By 2010, all villages in the eastern \nregion will be linked with asphalt or cement roads, and the same targets will be applied to 80% \nvillages in the central region and to 90% towns in the western region. \n \nG.  Road Transport Services \n11.  A relaxation of trucking regulations in the 1980s allowed privately owned trucks to haul \ncargo for state-owned factories and cooperatives. Privately owned trucks expanded their market \nshare during the 1990s at the expense of state-owned transport companies, many of which are \nnow being privatized. The competition improves road transport efficiency and service quality. \nMOC is encouraging the private sector to augment the overall capacity of the road transport \nindustry. More small freight operators will merge and more large state-owned companies will be \nprivatized. \n \nH.  Policy Dialogue \n \n12.  ADB has been undertaking policy dialogue on the PRC road sector since 1991.

Total \nmileage  of  newly  built  rural  road  every  year  is  about  50,000  kilometers  (km)  and  that  of \nreconstruction is about 150,000 km. In 2004, total mileage of rural road reached 1.42 million km. \nThe Government built 102,000 km of rural roads in 2003, and 250,000 km in 2004, building \nabout 192,000 km of paved rural roads. In 2004, along with building roads connecting to 123 \ntownships  and  11,200  villages,  the  Government  built  paved  roads  connecting  to  1,690 \ntownships and 57,500 villages. \n \n2.  The State Council approved the Rural Road Development Plan in February 2005. The \noverall objective of the plan aimed at 2020 is that the townships and villages will be accessible \nto paved roads, forming a rural road network with high service level, making travel more rapid, \nsafe, and comfortable for farmers. The development goal is that by 2010, all townships in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China will be connected to paved roads and all villages in eastern and \ncentral regions will be connected to paved roads by 2010. In 2010, total mileage of rural roads \nwill be 3.1 million km. This is expected to increase to 3.7 million km by 2020, improving density \nand service level of rural roads. \n \n3.  The project expressway is supported by the local road component, thereby improving \naccess to townships and villages in the project area. By lowering transport costs and travel \ntimes, the Project will foster trade, economic development, growth, and incomes in the region. In \ndoing so, it will help reduce the prices of daily necessities in local markets and villages served \nby its interchanges and improve access to external markets, information, services, and income-\nearning  opportunities.  These  benefits  will  be  increased  and  more  widely  distributed  by \nintegrating the 678 km of local road upgrading to the project design (Tables A5.1 and A5.2). The \nimportance of improving local roads is in line with the Government\u2019s policies. According to the \nRural Poverty Reduction Development Outline, road construction projects will be extended to \npoor areas to link their townships to national and provincial trunk roads. \n \n4.  Under the technical assistance,1 the local road component was formulated based on the \nfollowing principles: (i) it will explicitly target the improvement of access to poor townships and \nvillages and connecting them to the national and provincial road network in the project area, (ii) \nthe  prime  emphasis  will  be  on providing  all-weather  access  to the  remaining  centers  and \nimproving all-weather roads to poor villages, and (iii) the program should recognize the local \npriorities for road improvement. The component was prioritized by the number of the poor \nserved by the road. Township and village roads were ranked separately because a township\u2019s \npopulation includes the populations of villages in its administrative area. Once ranked, the top \ntwo thirds in each category were selected. A road survey followed the initial screening process \nto confirm the selections. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003.

Passenger Transport \n \n1.  The bus transport industry is regulated by the transport administration bureaus (TABs) at \nthe provincial, prefecture, and county levels. All bus operators need an operating license and all \nbuses have to be licensed for a specific route. The TAB may, in principle, grant licenses to more \nthan one operator on the same route, Yingjing county, however, has only one licensed bus \noperator. Fares for journeys terminating at townships or larger towns are regulated by the \nprovincial price bureau. Fares for township to village journeys are not regulated.  \n \n2.  A  relatively  dense  network  of  bus  routes  connects  almost  all  the  townships  in  the \nprovince, serving all the villages on the routes. Nevertheless, many villages with poor or no road \naccess still have no direct bus service. There are no cross-county routes that provide direct \nconnections across township boundaries without going through township centers.  \n \n3.  The  government  is  encouraging  private  involvement  in  the  transport  sector.  State \ncompanies are now being sold off. Regulated fares are only a little higher than financial vehicle \noperating costs per passenger for mini-buses operating on township and village roads, but that \nnet margins for medium buses on good roads are attractive. Bus operators report that their \nbusinesses are profitable, especially the longer-distance services.   \n \n4.  The TABs control the number of operators on each route in order to prevent \u201cover-\nsupply,\u201d while the number of trips per day carried out by each operator is controlled, either \nthrough operator associations or directly by state-owned bus terminal companies, which control \nthe bus schedule and allocate slots to operators. It would appear that these restrictive operating \npractices result in low vehicle utilization and, as a consequence, unnecessarily high operating \ncosts.  \n \n5.  In  the  project  area,  although  the  number  of  buses  in  operation  has  substantially \nincreased, this is mainly accounted for by a shift towards smaller buses.  The majority of \nlicensees are individuals; the number of company licensees has fallen significantly since 1997 \nand now only represents 12% of the total.  Total passenger volumes in the project area have \nincreased by 60% since 1997, although passenger-kilometers have only increased by 40%.  \n \nB.  Freight Transport \n \n6.  Any commercial trucking operation requires a license, which is issued by the prefecture \nTAB. Own-account trucking (for the transport of goods within the same enterprise) does not \nneed  a TAB  license.  Operators  must  meet  basic  requirements  on  financial  resources  and \nmaintenance capacity.  The licenses are of indefinite duration and a small fee is payable on \ninitial licensing and for the annual vehicle inspections.  There is no annual license fee.  \n \n7.  The Ministry of Communications publishes guidelines on freight rates but truckers are \nnot obliged to follow them.  In practice, rates are negotiated between the shipper and the trucker \nand are normally much lower than the guidelines. \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 6  37\n8.  The vast majority of truck operators are individuals. There are some large companies, \nstate-owned and private, but their number has fallen substantially since 1997. Like the bus \nindustry, state trucking is being privatized.  The market appears to be genuinely competitive. \nThere appear to be no unreasonable restrictions on the granting of licenses, and there is \nadequate trucking capacity. \n \n9.  In the project area, freight services are diverse and made up of short-distance transport \nof bulk goods such as cement, bricks, coal, and agricultural inputs, by medium-sized trucks; \ntransport of manufactured goods into the area and agricultural produce out of the area by \nmedium-sized and small trucks, either owner-operated or owned by the trader; and transport of \nsmall quantities of produce and goods by agricultural vehicle, horse, and individuals, especially \nto and from townships. \n \n10.  Overall there has been little increase in freight carried since 1997, and haul distances \nalso have remained static.  Ownership of all motorized vehicles, especially in the mountainous \nparts of the project area, is very low.  Fewer than 10% of households own agricultural vehicles.  \nHowever, it is expected that vehicle ownership will rise as road conditions improve in the project \narea. \n \nC.  Transport Demand \n \n11.  Excluding travel within villages, the most trips by rural residents are made to the county \ntowns and township centers.  Data from the social surveys show the following: \n \n(i)  The great majority of households make at least one trip per year to county towns \nand township centers. \n(ii)  The frequency of trips to township centers is much greater (47 trips per annum \non average compared with 29 to county towns).  \n(iii)  The great majority of trips to county towns are by bus whereas to township \ncenters they are made on foot.  Trips by other modes are negligible.  Overall \naround 58% of trips are motorized with around 80% of these being made by bus.  \n(iv)  The main trip purposes are trading and the sale of produce, business trips, \nshopping, and social. Far more trips to townships centers are for the trade and \nsale  of  produce  than  to  county  towns;  the  situation  is  reversed  for \nshopping/social trips.  \n(v)  In most respects, the travel characteristics of the poor are similar to those of the \nnonpoor. This holds true for poor households and all residents of poor villages. \nThere is one major, and crucial, exception: journey frequency\u2014the poor travel \nmuch less than the nonpoor.   \n \n12.  The major problem perceived by local residents was the poor quality of the access \nroads, which limit the availability of bus services and make travel time-consuming and difficult, \nparticularly in times of heavy rains or winter snows. \n \nD.  Conclusions  \n \n13.  The  bus  system  is  closely  regulated  down  to  township  level  but  flexible  on  route \nplanning. The rate of growth of routes is increasing as National Road 108 and township roads \nare improved. This can be taken as a strong indication that, where road access is possible and \nwhere demand is sufficient to ensure profitability, services will be provided. \n ", "38  Appendix 6 \n14.  Where bus services are not available or are inappropriate, transport is generally by foot \nor horse in the mountainous areas, and by foot, bicycle, or motorcycle in valley areas. Trishaws \noperate in urban areas and adjacent villages. The majority of households in rural areas make \ntrips, although they make substantially fewer trips. There is, however, no evidence that they do \nnot avail themselves of public transport services when they need them.  \n \n15.  Although there is no compelling evidence that fares are excessive compared with costs, \nthe TABs could do more to promote competition between bus operators. With completion of \nmore expressway links, it will become possible to license new routes. This would help ensure \nthat any savings in vehicle operating costs (VOCs) arising from road improvements are passed \non to passengers and will increase operational efficiency and promote service quality. The cost \nreductions brought about by road improvements make it more likely that new or more frequent \nservices will be introduced by a flexible bus transport sector.   \n \n16.  As for the freight transport, the characteristics of the transport services industry in the \nproject area do not impede the commercialization of agriculture, as it is sufficiently flexible and \ncompetitive to provide whatever scale and kind of services that may be required. There appear \nto be no restraints on the supply of freight transport services. Vehicles are relatively cheap and \ncredit to purchase them readily available. Rates are set competitively and supply responds \neffectively to changes in demand. Competition between the transport operators should ensure \nthat any savings in vehicle operating costs, which might arise from road improvements, would \nbe passed on to the users. \n \n17.  Fruit, the main cash crop, is mostly sold direct to traders at the farmgate. As there are \nsignificant numbers of traders, competition between them should ensure that some of the VOC \nsavings are passed on to the farmers in higher prices. Improved roads will also enable access \nby  smaller,  cheaper  farm  vehicles,  the  purchase  of  which  will,  in  some  instances,  enable \nfarmers to market more of their produce directly. \n ", "Appendix 7  39\nSTAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION AND CONSULTATIONS \n \nDate  No. of  Responses/Main issues \nAgency  Participants  Purpose \n(dd/mm/yy)  People  discussed/concerns \nSPDI, city,    Local    Feasibility  \u2022  Project team briefing on options \ncounty    government    study (FS)  and ask for opinions  \ngovernment    officials;      \u2022  Site visit, socioeconomic, traffic \nat    Communication    and land resources survey \nBureau; \nYa\u2019an  05/04/99  40  \u2022  Land acquisition compensation \nPlanning and \nYingjing  standards and main materials\u2019 \n10/04/99  Reform  30 \nHanyuan  prices survey \n20/04/99  Commissions;  30 \nShimian  25/04/99  Statistical  30  \u2022  Obtain relevant plans and their \nMianning  Bureau;  development \n07/05/99  30 \nXichang  Land Resource  \u2022  Government, farmers, enterprises \n15/05/99  40 \nBureau;  and religious groups gave their \nEnvironmental  opinions on the project proposal \nProtection  \u2022  Requests for socioeconomic \nBureau;  information \nWater Resource  \u2022  Survey inputs for engineering \nBureau;  feasibility study \nResettlement \n\u2022  Estimation of project impact \nOffices; \n\u2022  Awareness of the proposed project \nPoverty \n\u2022  Consultation with local government \nAlleviation \nand enterprises on the future \nOffices; \ndevelopment plans and how the \nTransport \nexpressway will facilitate their \nAdministraions; \ndevelopment effectively \nUrban \nConstruction  \u2022  Avoid villages and/or buildings if \nBureau;  possible and use the existing \nroads, whenever possible, to \nRoad \nminimize farmland occupation in \nMaintenance; \nalignment selection \nRailway; \n \nAviation; \nWater ransport; \nRepresentatives \nof local farmers, \nfactories and \nreligions \nSPCD  15/10/98    23  FS  \u2022  Government, farmers, enterprises \n18/03/99  50  Resettlement  and religious groups gave further  \nopinions on the project proposal \n20/06/99  33  Alignment \n10/09/99  26  survey  \u2022  Site visit \n16/07/00  32  \u2022  Further consultation with local \ngovernment and enterprises on \n20/08/01  40 \nfuture development planning \n10/05/02  35 \n\u2022  Further site survey \n26/08/03  42 \n \n20/02/04  36 \n ", "40  Appendix 7 \nDate  No. of  Responses/Main issues \nAgency  Participants  Purpose \n(dd/mm/yy)  People  discussed/concerns \nEIA  2002  Villages  55  Obtain  \u2022  Mainly positive about construction \nConsultants  opinions on  and alignment of highway.

The Project Expressway is the final section of the Chengdu\u2013Panzhihua Highway, one of \neight  important  highways  planned  for  implementation  of  the  Western  Region  Development \nStrategy and one of the key national roads, the Lanzhou (Gansu Province) to Muhan (Yunnan \nProvince)  highway,  and  is  also  one  of  the  sections  of  the  proposed  Sichuan  Provincial \nExpressway Network. With completion of this Project, the Chengdu\u2013Panzhihua Corridor will \nbecome  a  major  artery  for  the  regional  transport  network,  connecting  with  national  and \nprovincial roads. \n \n2.  The project expressway will be built in parallel to an existing class-II national road (NR \n108) that has a pavement in poor condition over many sections, suffers from winter icing and \nsnow in the higher elevations, has poor horizontal and vertical alignment and already suffers \nsome congestion and interference from local and nonmotorized traffic. The expressway will link \nup  in  Lugu  with  the  ongoing  Asian  Development  Bank-financed  Southern  Sichuan  Road \nDevelopment Project and provide efficient and safe road transport in central Sichuan. \n \n3.  Traffic  surveys  were  carried  out  under  the  feasibility  study.  Sixteen-hour  origin-\ndestination (O-D) surveys and associated 24-hour classified traffic counts were done at 15 key \nlocations along the existing NR108 and linking roads. The surveys were carried out in April \n2000. The expressway starts just south of the city of Ya\u2019an. The highest flows are just south of \nYa\u2019an with the low flows in the mountainous sparsely populated area between Yingjing and \nHanyuan counties. The proportion of trucks is typically more than half, but ranges from 21% to \n73%. Over all traffic survey stations, the feasibility study recorded 62% trucks, mainly light and \nmedium-sized ones in about equal proportions. \n \n4.  The evaluation of alternative options in the project corridor\u2014i.e., with and without the \nproposed expressway\u2014has been carried out using the feasibility traffic demand OD matrices \nand assigning these flows over the road networks expected to in 2000 (the base year), 2011, \n2020, and 2030. For each link in this network, the length, pavement width, surface type, terrain, \nestimated pavement roughness, and available traffic counts were entered into the network data \nfiles to assist with validation of the matrices and traffic assignments.  \n \n5.  Vehicle speeds are affected by terrain and the degree of congestion, in turn a function of \nthe capacity of the link. Estimates of road capacity were based on the revised the Ministry of \nCommunication\u2019s Technical Standards for Highway Engineering. An initial free-flow speed was \ndefined for each road link, used in estimating initial link travel times. As link loadings increase \nand links become more congested, these times increase and link speeds reduce. The revised \nspeeds are adjusted using speed-flow relationships, also used in calculating user costs on links \nfor the economic evaluation. The relationships have been updated to take account of the hourly \ndistribution of traffic volumes and the vehicle mix in the corridor. \n \n6.  Forecast passenger and freight vehicle OD matrices for 2011, 2020, and 2030 were \ndeveloped from the 2000 base-year matrices by applying projections of regional gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) and estimates of elasticities of transport demand with respect to GDP growth. \nBased on a comparison of trends in GDP and alternative measures of transport demand\u2014\npassenger vehicles and trucks registered, total passengers and tons moved, and estimated \npassenger-km  and  ton-km  in  other  developed  and  undeveloped  provinces,  the  following \ndemand elasticities were adopted: passenger trips 1.2, freight trips 0.8. \n \n7.  The forecast GDP growth rates were applied to the calibrated base-year matrices to \nproduce interzonal passenger and freight vehicle flows for 2011, 2020, and 2030, which were ", "Appendix 11  45\nassigned to the without-project road network for the base year and each forecast year. Non-\nmodeled (intrazonal) traffic was preloaded to the appropriate network links.  \n \n8.  By  2010,  the  traffic  on  the  existing  NR108  will  reach  capacity  at  several  points, \nparticularly near Yuchen, and by 2020 it will be well over capacity along its whole route. Rather \nthan have an increasing proportion of traffic artificially divert to much longer alternative routes \nvia  other  corridors,  the  capacity  of  NR108  has  been  increased  to  reflect  a  more  realistic \nscenario of incremental widening at the most congested points. This was done for certain \nsections in 2011, and again in 2020, when congestion will have worsened further. \n \n9.  Road vehicles moving from one zone to another choose between alternative routes on \nthe basis of their perceptions of generalized travel cost, a function of travel time, distance, and \ntoll cost. Given the significant improvements in terms of the performance and efficiency of the \nYa\u2019an\u2013Lugu corridor as a result of the Project Expressway, it will attract significant vehicle trips \n(especially through trips) from other roads, and this will reduce the number of accidents, vehicle \noperating costs (VOCs), and travel time on many roads in the corridor and thereby directly \nbenefit the project area. \n \n10.  When the expressway is built, it will become a more attractive alternative route for \npeople and goods traveling along the corridor, particularly for those traveling long distances by \nrail. At present, the railway carries most of the long-distance bulk traffic in the project corridor. \nWhen the expressway opens, some of the passengers and freight using rail will start using it. \nThe completed expressway from Chengdu to Panzhihua will reduce the driving distance to 610 \nkm. This compares with a rail distance of 749 km. Express passenger trains cover the journey at \nan average of 60 km/h, while the slower services travel at 50 km/h. Passengers will save about \n5 hours if they divert from rail to road.  \n \n11.  Traffic forecast was determined based on socioeconomic trends that took into account \nchanges in variables such as gross domestic product, population, and vehicle ownership. The \nforecast traffic volume on the expressway is expected to grow from 10,615 passenger car units \n(pcu) in 2011 to 20,495 pcu in 2021, a 6.8% average annual growth rate. It will then grow more \nslowly at 5.8% per annum thereafter to reach 34,043 pcu in 2030. Through traffic will be about \n40% of the total. The traffic on the local roads will grow more slowly because of slow growth \nprospects in the project area. \n \nTable A11: Average Annual Daily Traffic of Project Expressway \n(passenger car units) \n                    \n        Growth    Growth \nRoad Section  2011  2021  Rate (%)  2030  Rate (%) \nYucheng-Yingjing  14,686   30,094  7.4  51,526  6.2 \nYingjing-Jiuxiang  11,744   23,210  7.0  39,174  6.0 \nJiuxiang-Hanyuan  10,894   21,411  7.0  35,994  5.9 \nHanyuan-Shimian  10,734   20,751  6.8  34,410  5.8 \nShimian-Liziping  9,551   18,009  6.5  29,469  5.6 \nLiziping-Mianning  9,140   16,927  6.4  27,456  5.5 \nMianning-\u2013Lugu  9,464   17,712  6.5  28,820  5.6 \nWeighted Average  10,615   20,495  6.8  34,043  5.8 \nSource: Asian Development Bank and TA consultants. \n ", "46  Appendix 12 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n1.  The project expressway traverses central Sichuan Province. Local roads are connected \nto the expressway through the road network system. The economic analysis covers the 26 \nyears of construction and operation. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project \nwas estimated by comparing the situation with and without the Project. Without the Project, \ntraffic will use the existing road network, which will be congested and expensive to maintain due \nto the rapidly increasing volume of traffic. Some travel may not take place because of the \ncongestion and the resulting increasing travel times and vehicle operating costs (VOCs). With \nthe Project, congestion on the existing roads will be reduced, and traffic on the expressway and \nthe existing roads will benefit from faster, cheaper, and safer travel. Additional trips will be \ngenerated as the economy responds to lower transport costs and better service. \n \n2.  Alternative Analysis. As part of economic analysis, possible alternative interventions \nwere considered to meet the growing transport demand in the project area as part of the \nnational and provincial transport network plan. Alternative analysis reviewed various options in \nterms of transport modes, alignments, technical designs, timing of investments, and financing \nmodalities. While enhancing the existing railway capacity may be an option to partly meet the \nincreasing demand, it will not completely satisfy the various kinds of traffic, particularly high-\nvalue general cargo that requires a more flexible and responsive mode to meet the needs of a \nmarket  economy.  Six  alternative  alignments  were  reviewed  based  on  geologic  and \ntopographical conditions, terrain considerations, consultations with community representatives, \ncost estimates, relative impacts on environment and resettlement, and integration with the \nnational and local transport network. The expressway technical design was proposed after \nconsideration of the national highway network, consistency in the standards of contiguous \nsections  at  each  end  of  the  project  expressway,  and  forecast  traffic.  Alternative  financing \nmodalities  were  considered,  including  private  sector  investment.  However,  private  sector \ninvestment was not found attractive due to risks associated with construction and low estimated \nrates of return. Hence, public financing was considered appropriate. \n \n3.  General  Parameters.  Economic  evaluation  was  undertaken  using  constant  2005 \neconomic prices. The prices are expressed in yuan using the domestic price numeraire, with a \nshadow exchange rate factor of 1.013 for foreign exchange effects. A shadow price was used to \nplace an economic value on the wages paid to unskilled labor, while skilled labor was not \nshadow priced since there is no surplus of skilled workers. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.67 \nwas used to convert the financial wage rate to an economic opportunity cost of labor. \n \n4.  Costs. The capital costs and physical contingencies for the Project are revalued at \neconomic  prices  by  separating  the  cost  items  into  tradable  materials  and  equipment, \nnontradable materials, labor, and land. The land and resettlement costs were based on their \nopportunity costs, i.e., agricultural output forgone and re-siting of displaced activities. \n \n5.  Benefits. The economic benefits include (i) savings in VOCs resulting from the reduced \ntravel distance and improved road conditions, (ii) savings in the value of passenger time and of \nfreight tied up in transit, (iii) savings resulting from fewer accidents, (iv) benefits to generated \ntraffic, and (v) savings in capital and operation and maintenance (O&M) costs for National \nHighway (NH) 108. A reduction in VOCs is the main source of economic benefits for the Project. \nTraffic diverting to the expressway would travel at high, more economical speeds on a smoother \nroad,  with  better  vertical  and  horizontal  alignment,  less  congestion,  and  a  shorter  journey \ndistance. Traffic remaining on the alternative NH108 route would also benefit from a reduction in \ntraffic volume and congestion. All these changes affect vehicle speeds and VOCs, which were ", "Appendix 12  47\nestimated for all vehicle types likely to use the corridor. Savings in travel time will be seen both \non the project expressway and the existing roads. Work-related travel time was evaluated for \nprivate vehicles and buses. The economic cost of accidents was estimated on direct property \ndamage and foregone income. \n \n6.  Six hundred seventy-eight km of local roads will be improved concurrently with the \nexpressway component. The costs of this component include capital costs and O&M costs. The \nprincipal benefits of the local road improvements were identified as reduced VOCs and the \nproducer surplus (the value of additional production minus production costs). Transport cost \nsavings will accrue to normal traffic on the improved roads. The local roads recommended for \nupgrading  were  chosen  based  on  poverty  incidence,  the  effect  on  overall  road  network \nefficiency, economic development potential, and population density. \n \n7.  Result and Conclusion. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project, \nincluding the expressway and local road components, is 15.2% (Table A12.1). The EIRR for the \nexpressway component alone is 15.2%, and for the local road component, 15.9%. VOC savings \nare  the  major  economic  benefit  (78%),  followed  by  travel  time  savings  (13%),  local  road \ncomponent (3%), and accident cost savings (3%). \n \n8.  The results of the sensitivity analysis confirm the robustness of the Project\u2019s economic \nviability: changes in the key  variables\u2014construction costs, benefits, traffic growth, residual \nvalue, and 1-year delay in completion\u2014do not significantly affect the economic viability (Table \nA12.2). The capital cost would have to be 61% higher than estimated for the EIRR to fall below \nthe cutoff rate of 12%. Considering the experience of ADB in the PRC, such an increase in \ncapital cost is unlikely. ADB-financed road projects in the PRC have not encountered major cost \noverruns, and the contract prices tend to be lower than estimated because the contracting \nprocess is becoming increasingly competitive. The benefit level would have to decrease more \nthan 38% to make the Project economically nonviable. A risk analysis was carried out to \ndetermine the degree of uncertainty on the Project. Each uncertainty factor (such as capital \ncost, traffic growth, and VOC value) was varied at random within the limits. The results showed \nthat an EIRR exceeding 12% will be achieved with a 95% probability. The economic analysis of \nthe Project was extended to analyze distribution of project net benefits by determining the \nproject effects for various beneficiaries, including road users (passenger and freight), labor, and \ngovernment. It was found that road users will receive the largest share of net benefit, accounting \nfor 93% of the total net benefits (Table A12.3). \n ", " \n \nTable A12.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n(constant 2005 economic prices, domestic price numeraire, CNY million) \n \n4\n8\n \n \n \n \nCosts    Benefits      \n \nWithout  With Project Costs    Vehicle    \nFreight  A\nYear  Project  Operation   Operating  Time  Accident  Generated  Diversion  Local  Net  Benefit  p\nLocal  Total  Transit  Total    p\nRoad  Capital  and  Cost  Savings Savings Traffic  From Rail Roads e\nRoads  Savings  n\nCosts  Maintenance  Savings  d\nix\n2006      1,150.5      1,150.5                     (1,150.5)   1\n2\n2007      2,816.6      2,816.6                     (2,816.6)   \n2008      3,094.9    108.0  3,202.9                     (3,202.9) \n2009      2,680.4    270.0  2,950.4                     (2,950.4) \n2010      2,252.3    162.0  2,414.3                     (2,414.3) \n2011  36.3    1,899.7  17.8  0.3  1,881.5      280.2  44.7 12.8  7.0  0.8    9.7  15.2     370.5    (1,511.0) \n2012  38.2    73.7  1.2  36.7   1,254.3  200.3 55.1  31.4  3.6  39.5  66.2  1,650.4    1,613.7 \n2013  40.2    76.3  1.2  37.3   1,400.4  223.6 59.0  35.1  4.0  40.2  72.0  1,834.4    1,797.2 \n2014  42.3    79.0  1.2  37.9   1,563.6  249.7 63.3  39.1  4.5  41.0  78.4  2,039.6    2,001.7 \n2015  44.5    81.8  1.2  38.5   1,745.7  278.8 67.9  43.7  5.0  41.8  85.3  2,268.2    2,229.7 \n2016  46.9    84.7  1.2  39.0   1,949.1  311.3 72.8  48.8  5.6  42.6  92.8  2,522.9    2,483.9 \n2017  49.3    87.7  1.2  39.6   2,176.2  347.5 78.0  54.5  6.2  43.4  101.0  2,806.9    2,767.2 \n2018  51.9    90.9  1.2  40.2   2,429.7  388.0 83.6  60.8  7.0  44.3  109.9  3,123.3    3,083.1 \n2019  54.6    94.2  1.2  40.7   2,712.8  433.2 89.7  67.9  7.8  45.1  119.5  3,476.0    3,435.3 \n2020  57.5       347.8  270.0  1.2  561.6   3,028.8  483.7 96.1  75.8  8.7  46.0  130.0  3,869.1    3,307.6 \n2021  58.4    101.1  1.2  43.9   3,381.7  540.0 102.4  84.7  9.7  47.3  141.4  4,307.1    4,263.2 \n2022  59.3    104.8  1.2  46.7   3,702.9  591.3 109.1  92.7  10.6  48.7  153.7  4,709.0    4,662.3 \n2023  60.3    108.6  1.2  49.5   4,054.7  647.5 116.2  101.5  11.6  50.1  167.0  5,148.6    5,099.1 \n2024  61.3    112.6  1.2  52.5   4,439.9  709.0 123.8  111.1  12.7  51.5  181.6  5,629.6    5,577.1 \n2025  62.4    116.7  1.2  55.6   4,861.7  776.4 131.8  121.7  14.0  53.0  197.4  6,155.9    6,100.3 \n2026  63.5    121.0  1.2  58.8   5,323.5  850.1 140.5  133.3  15.3  54.5  214.5  6,731.7    6,672.9 \n2027  64.6    125.5  1.2  62.1   5,829.3  930.9 149.6  145.9  16.7  56.0  233.1  7,361.6    7,299.6 \n2028  65.9    130.1  1.2  65.5   6,383.1  1,019.3 159.4  159.8  18.3  57.7  253.4  8,050.9    7,985.4 \n2029  67.2    135.0  1.2  69.0   6,989.4  1,116.1 169.8  175.0  20.1  59.3  275.4  8,805.1    8,736.1 \n2030  68.5       284.9  140.0         1.2         357.5   7,653.4  1,222.2 180.9  191.6  22.0  61.0  299.3  9,630.4    9,272.9 \n2031  69.9  (8,197.7)  145.2  (270.0)   (8,363.7)   8,380.5  1,338.3 192.7  209.8  24.1  62.7  325.4  10,533.5    18,925.9 \n                      Economic Net Present Value =    CNY4,013.5 \n                      Economic Internal Rate of Return =    15.2% \nCNY = yuan. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and TA consultants estimates.", "Appendix 12  49\nTable A12.2: Sensitivity Analysis \n \nEconomic Net  Switching \nChange  EIRR \nScenario  Present Value  Valuea \n(%)  (%) \n(CNY million)  (%) \n         \nBase Case    \u2014  15.2  4,013              \u2014 \n1.

The projected financial statements of the proposed Central Sichuan Road Development \nProject has been prepared in current terms for 2006\u20132017. Construction will be completed in \nSeptember 2011, and the first year of full operation will be 2012. The foreign and local inflation \nrates  are  assumed  at  2%  and  3%  during  the  projection  period.  The  cost  estimates  are \npresented  in  current  terms  taking  into  account  the  potential  impacts  of  domestic  and \ninternational inflation.  \n \nB.  Financial Projections \n \n2.  Operating revenues from tolls are projected based on forecast of future traffic and a \nbase toll rate of CNY0.35 per passenger car per kilometer (km). Corresponding tolls for other \nvehicle types are CNY0.70 for a small bus or a light truck; CNY1.05 for a medium-sized bus or \ntruck; CNY1.40 for a large bus or truck, and CNY1.75 for an articulated truck or a trailer.1 The \ntoll charges are assumed to increase in current terms once every 5 years to keep up with \ninflation.  There  would  be  no  real increase  of  project  tolls  over  project  life span.  A  set  of \nexpressway and tunnel tolls was devised in conjunction with the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) diversion curves, and to achieve close to optimum financial and economic performance. \nOther income (from fuel sales, rental income, etc) amounts to 1.5% of toll revenue.  \n \n3.   Annual incremental operation and maintenance (O&M) costs are calculated based on \n2005 prices as follows: (i) toll operation cost totaled an estimated CNY10.7 million in 2011 (269 \nstaff members with annual average wages and other costs of CNY31,500). Labor costs will rise \nat a growth rate of 4% in real terms, and staff numbers will increase with traffic flows using an \nelasticity of 0.05; (ii) routine maintenance costs are estimated at CNY50,000 per km per year; \nand it will increase in line with traffic flows using an elasticity of 0.3; (iii) tunnel operating and \nmaintenance expenses account for about 60% of total O&M expenses in the opening year. The \ncosts  of  ventilating  the  longest  tunnels  account  for  about  half  of  tunnel  operating  and \nmaintenance  costs;  and  (iv)  environmental  monitoring  costs  CNY740,000  per  year.  All \nincremental O&M costs are projected to increase annually in line with domestic inflation rates. In \naddition, periodic maintenance would be required after 10 years of operation at a cost of \nCNY1.4 million per km in 2005 prices and CNY2.2 million in 2020 prices. \n4.  Depreciation is calculated on a declining balance depreciation method with an average \nlife of about 50 years of the main expressway structure, 20 years of pavement component, and \n15 years for equipment. \n5.  Applicable business taxes at a rate of 5.5% are charged on revenue.  Corporate income \ntax  at  15%  is  paid  on  income  after  deducting  business  taxes,2 depreciation  and  interest \ncharges, operating expenses and any prior year losses carried forward.   \n6.  The Project will be funded 45% by equity or grants, 55% by long-term loans. The China \nDevelopment Bank (CDB) loan will be repayable over 26 years, including a 6-year grace period. \nFor the ADB\u2019s loan, it is assumed as 26-year maturity, including a 6-year grace period, US \n                                                 \n1  The toll rates proposed and their structures are consistent both with trends of Sichuan practice and tolls on the \nexisting, adjacent stretch of expressway. \n2  Concessionary rate for qualifying western region companies, including the project expressway.

Projected financial statements are presented in Table A13.1. The projected financial \nstatements indicate the forecast revenue under the base assumptions are sufficient to cover \nannual  recurrent  costs,  depreciation,  debt  repayments  on  the  ADB  and  CDB  loans,  and \ngenerate reasonable profits from the expressway operation. \nC.  Financial Analysis  \n8.  The major assumptions used for calculation of a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \nare the following: (i) all calculations are made in 2005 prices, covering 2006 to 2031; (ii) capital \ncosts include all incremental capital expenditures related to the construction and equipment for \nthe expressway, but exclude price contingencies and interest during construction; (iii) O&M \ncosts  include  all  annual  incremental  expenses  incurred  in  operating  the  expressway,  but \nexclude depreciation and debt repayment provisions; (iv) operating revenues from toll used in \nfinancial projections are also adjusted to 2005 prices; (v) the residual value of the expressway \nwas estimated based on the weighted depreciation value of 2.4% per year.  \n9.  The estimated weighted average cost of capital (WACC), after tax, in real terms was \ncalculated using estimated capital mix and costs of funds. Costs have been considered as \nfollows: (i) the applicable 10-year fixed swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s spread of 0.60% is \nused for ADB debt; (ii) the estimated interest costs of 5.76% per annum is used for the domestic \nloan funds; and (iii) the cost of equity was assumed to be 8.00%. The cost of debt is also \nadjusted to reflect the impact of income tax of 15%. The nominal cost of debt is converted to the \nreal cost of debt by applying domestic and international average inflation rate for domestic and \nforeign currency denominated debt respectively.  \n \n10.  The project FIRR, computed after tax, is 5.4%. This compares favorably with the WACC, \nalso computed after tax, of 3.9% (Table A13.2). The Project is considered financially viable and \nsustainable. Sensitivity tests indicate conditions causing the Project's viability to fall below \nWACC are unlikely to occur. The sensitivity of the Project's financial indicators to cost and \nrevenue variations is shown in Table A13.3. \n ", "Table A13.1: Projected Financial Statements \n(CNY million) \nYear 5\nItem 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2\nATOo.t hlPl errreo vrjeeevcnetuenedu eIncome Statement 00..00 00..00 00..00 00..00 00..00 2310..60 99154..29 1,06196..00 1,21128..02 1,30119..95 1,62244..14 1,74246..52 A            \n    Gross Revenue 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 231.6 1,010.1 1,085.0 1,230.2 1,321.4 1,648.5 1,770.7 p\np\nNet revenue after business tax 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 218.9 955.4 1,026.2 1,163.5 1,249.8 1,559.2 1,674.8 e\nn\nOperation and maintenance 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 18.3 77.8 82.7 88.0 93.6 99.6 106.0 d\nDepreciation and amortization expenses 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 416.7 406.2 395.9 385.9 376.1 366.6 ix\n    Operating Profit 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 200.6 460.9 537.3 679.6 770.3 1,083.5 1,202.2  1\n3\nLess: Interest expenses 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 506.2 485.9 461.5 435.3 408.9 381.9\nPre-tax profit (loss) 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 200.6 (45.3) 51.4 218.1 335.0 674.6 820.3\nIncome tax 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.9 32.7 50.3 101.2 123.1\n    Net Profit (Loss) for the Year 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 200.6 (45.3) 50.5 185.4 284.7 573.4 697.2\nB.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \nContributions will be mainly through improved linkage to market and improved access to external jobs and \nsocial services for the poor; lower transport costs of agricultural inputs and products; better access to and \ninteraction with other regions, and jobs during construction and after completion, owing to increased \neconomic activities. Specifically, the Project\u2019s local road component of 678 kilometers (km) will help local \npeople to break the transport bottleneck and therefore add economic value to their fruits, vegetables, and \nanimals that have been introduced by various poverty reduction, minority redevelopment and agricultural \ndevelopment programs. The expressway, especially interchange areas, and local roads will speed up the \ndevelopment of mineral and tourism resources and facilitate the formation of new local growth centers that \nwill have greater impact on poverty reduction. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nOne  hundred  sixty-eight  (23.6%)  and  118  (16.5%)  villages,  out  of  713,  are  provincial  and  county \ndesignated poverty villages, respectively. About 273,000 rural and urban poor will directly benefit from the \nproject, accounting for 29% of the total beneficiaries. 253,000 out of the total poor beneficiaries are rural \npoor, which is 93% of total poor beneficiaries and 34% of total rural beneficiaries. In addition, 28,000 rural \npoor, out of 80,000 population in total, from two indirect project counties will benefit from the local roads. \nThe project will directly generate economic opportunities for the poor through improved access to urban \nmarkets and to other social services, reduced transport costs, and better access to and interaction with \nother regions. Directly and indirectly, through the promotion of agricultural commercialization and of local \nlevel urbanization, the project will contribute to the effectiveness of poverty reduction effects achieved and \nto be achieved. In addition, a social development action plan (SDAP) was prepared to enhance the project \nbenefits to the poor and ethnic minorities along the alignment and the broader project area, such as local \nmineral and tourism development.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nA stakeholder analysis was done during the feasibility study and roles of each stakeholder are well \ndefined. The Sichuan Provincial Communications Department (SPCD) is the Executing Agency and is \nresponsible for fundraising and overall supervision; the Implementing Agency (IA) is responsible for \nimplementation of construction activities and then the operation of the project expressway. The local \ncounty  and  township  governments  and  communities  will  assist  the  IA  in  land  acquisition,  the \nimplementation of a resettlement plan, and the organization of local labor for expressway construction. \nWith support from SPCD, the IA will also upgrade 678 km of local roads for poor communities in \nconsultations with the local communities. All stakeholders will take part in implementing SDAP.  \nSPCD and the technical assistance (TA) consultants have undertaken socioeconomic surveys and public \nmeetings, which have raised the level of awareness and gained local support. These processes have \nenabled the local stakeholders to express their opinions and to make relevant suggestions for expressway \nand  local  road  designs  (e.g.,  locations  of  crossings)  and  implementation.  Specifically,  intensive \nconsultation of rural poor, women, and minority population was carried out during TA socioeconomic \nsurvey on project impact and local road selection. The participatory activities are an ongoing process that \nwill  continue  during  project  implementation.  The  poor,  women,  and  minority  people  will  be  further \nconsulted during project implementation. ", "Appendix 14  55\nIs there a participation strategy?

During the \nselection of the expressway alignment, local leaders from the project-affected villages and townships will \nbe consulted further in order to minimize the loss of high-quality arable land and structures. For the local \nroad component, local villagers will provide unskilled labor at local market rates. Township governments \nand community organizations will be involved in the implementation of the village economic rehabilitation \ncomponent of the resettlement plan. \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThere are gender differences in the division of labor as in many other regions. Men are mainly employed in \noutside and heavy physical activities and as migrant workers, while women are responsible for household \nchores and cropping activities. Women\u2019s role in household and community decision making varies from \nplace to place and is improving although still limited. Of all the women surveyed, 85%, 2%, and 13%, felt \nsatisfied, unsatisfied and unclear, respectively, about their current status. As in other parts of the PRC, \nurban and roadside communities have less obvious differences between women and men in division of \nlabor and decision making. Therefore the project, especially the local roads, will enhance women\u2019s role in \ngeneral. As part of the participation strategy, priority will be given to women for direct and indirect project \nbenefits,  which  are  included  in  the  ethnic  minority  development  plan  (EMDP)  and  SDAP.  Gender \ndisaggregated indicators will be monitored in the project performance monitoring system. To prevent an \nincreased risk of HIV/AIDS1 infection associated with the Project, the centers for disease control (CDCs) \nagreed  to extend  their preventive  measures  to  the  construction  sites  of  the  road  project,  including \nprovisions of HIV test kits, condoms, education, posters, leaflets, and regular services such as monitoring \nand surveillance, focusing on the construction workers.

An  ethnic  minorities  development  plan  (EMDP)  was  prepared  to  ensure  equitable \nsharing of project benefits by implementing mitigation measures for adverse impacts on minority \ncommunities in the project area. A full EMDP is available in Supplementary Appendix K. The \nEMDP is based on the resettlement plan, the social and poverty assessment, and consultation \nwith ethnic minority groups, and local county governments and their line agencies. This plan \nprimarily targets the project-affected Yi minority, who account for about 86% (138,000) of the \ntotal minority population.  \n \n2.  The Yi are the poorest in the project area. A field survey indicated that (i) the poverty \nincidence  (average  per  capita  annual  income  of  under  CNY900)  among  the  surveyed  Yi \ncommunities is 45%, while it is 17% for the Han; (ii) the average per capita annual income of the \nsurveyed Yi villages is CNY975, while it is CNY1,450 for the Han; and (iii) only 4% of Yi \nhouseholds have a motor vehicle, compared to 28% for the Han. The education level for the Yi \nis lower than for the Han. The adult illiteracy rate of the Yi, for instance, is as high as 35%, while \nthat of the Han is 5%. Migration to local mines and construction sites is common for both the Yi \nand Han in recent years. However, the Han also seek migration work in other regions while the \nYi do not. While the Han migrate from rural to major urban areas to find off-farm jobs, they are \nunlikely to migrate to the project area because it has no new permanent jobs, only temporary \njobs in road construction. The project area is an area of narrow corridors and high mountains, \nwith no potential for large-scale industrial development. Population growth during 1995\u20132000 in \nthe project area was 0.06% to 1.53%. No HIV/AIDS1 cases were reported in the project counties. \nAround 24,400 expressway construction workers will go to the project area and will interact with \nlocal minority population, increasing its risk of exposure to HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted \ninfections. \n \n3.  Surveys identified 1,918 ethnic minority households (6,790 people) from 38 villages in 15 \ntownships that would be affected by land acquisition (34% of total project-affected people), and \n141 ethnic minority households (472 people) would be affected by house displacement (18% of \ntotal).  The  project-affected  minority  households  are  all  Yi.  Resettlement  impact  of  ethnic \nminorities is addressed in the resettlement plan. \n \n4.  To mitigate possible adverse impacts and enhance positive impacts on the Yi minority, \nthe  government  will  implement  measures  shown  in  Table  A15.  The  Sichuan  Provincial \nCommunications  Department  (SPCD),  together  with  the  country  governments,  will  be \nresponsible for implementing the EMDP. SPCD will engage a domestic agency to conduct \nindependent monitoring and evaluation and submit reports to the Asian Development Bank. \n \nTable A15: Mitigation Measures  \n \nProposed  Budget \nTargets/Indicators  Beneficiaries  Timing \nMeasures    (CNY '000) \nProhibiting nighttime \nProtection of  Included in \nconstruction \nminority  Over 180,000 minority  the project \nBuilding of 383 grade separated \ncommunities from  people from 503 sub-villages  environmental  2006\u20132010 \ncrossings \nconstruction  of 70 villages  impact \nReconstruction of damaged \ndisturbances  assessment \nirrigation and drainage systems \n                                                 \n1 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n ", "58  Appendix 15 \nProposed    Budget  \nBeneficiaries  Timing \nMeasures   Targets/Indicators  (CNY '000) \nHealth clinics in construction \ncamps \nHIV/AIDS and STI prevention \nMinority residents in PA, \nposters \nespecially along the \nControl of  HIV/AIDS and STI education \nexpressway  Included in \ntransmissible  programs  2006\u20132010 \n  the project \ndiseases  Implementation of the \nOver 20,000 migrant \ninternational anti-AIDS programs\nconstruction workers \nZero case of HIV/AIDS in the \nproject areas during the \nconstruction period \nEncourage women \nOver 90,000 minority women  Included in \nto participate in  Number of meetings \nfrom 503 sub-villages of 70  Government  2006\u20132010 \nmeetings and  Number of newsletters \nvillages.  program \ndecisions \n1% of total resettlement budget \n  to be reserved for vulnerable       \ngroups \nOptions for affected households \nto selected new settlement sites \nIncluded in \n6 months notice time for project-\nresettlement \naffected households to select \nplan.

The proposed Project will finance the construction of an expressway between Ya\u2019an and \nLugu, with a length of 244 kilometers (km), and a local road component with a total length of \n678 km county to township and township to village roads. The resettlement plan1 covers both \ncomponents  based  on  the  feasibility  study.  The  proposed  Yalu  expressway  (including \nconnecting  roads)  will  affect  29  townships  and  93  administrative  villages  in  five  counties: \nYucheng, Yingjing, Hanyuan, and Shimian in Ya\u2019an municipality; and Mianning in Liangshan \nPrefecture. The local road program involves upgrading the existing county to township and \ntownship to village roads, so it is not expected to involve a significant amount of land acquisition \nand resettlement. The resettlement plan will be revised after completion of the preliminary \ndesign, including village rehabilitation plans, and submitted to the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) for approval prior to commencement of land acquisition. \n2.  For the expressway, 1,466 hectares (ha) will be permanently acquired, of which 21% is \npaddy, 35% dryland, 15% orchard, 15% forestland, 1% housing plots, and 13% wasteland. \nAnother  347.6  ha  will  be  occupied  temporarily  during  construction.  Based  on  per  capita \nfarmland in affected villages, farmland acquisition will be equivalent to 20,237 people (5,711 \nhouseholds) losing all their farmland. It is expected that the average loss of farmland per \nhousehold will be 25%; 94,800 square meters (m2) of houses will be demolished, requiring \nrelocation of 790 households (2,634 people). About 70% of houses are made of brick and wood, \nand earth and wood, and 30% are brick and concrete. Most of these households will be moved \na  short  distance  within  their  original  village.  All  land,  housing,  and  other  assets  will  be \ncompensated at replacement value.  \n3.  For people unavoidably affected, the resettlement objective is to achieve equal or better \nincome  and  living  standards  in  line  with  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  Land \nAdministration  Law  (1998)  and  the  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement.  The  Sichuan \nProvincial  Communications  Department  (SPCD)  will  ensure  that  any  people  losing  land, \nhousing, other assets, or income sources will be assisted to fully restore their income and living \nstandards. A comprehensive compensation rate (for land compensation, resettlement subsidy, \nand cost of young crops) has been estimated at CNY480,000 per ha for irrigated farmland, and \nCNY300,000 per ha for dry land. Those losing land temporarily during construction will receive a \npayment equivalent to production value foregone for the period of loss, which is expected to be \n2 years.  The land used temporarily will also be restored by the contractor to the original \ncondition. For structures to be demolished, replacement value will be provided to the affected \nhouseholds based on compensation rates adopted in affected city and prefecture, which range \nfrom CNY350 to CNY450/m2 for brick and concrete structures, CNY280 to CNY340/m2 for brick-\nwood  structure,  and  CNY220  to  CNY260/m2  for  earth  and  wood  structures.  Those  losing \nhousing will be compensated for their housing plot, equivalent to the rate for irrigated farmland, \nso they can acquire new housing sites close to a road and with electricity and water in their \nvillage  group  or  administrative  village.  Housing  compensation  will  not  be  reduced  for \ndepreciation, and people will be allowed to salvage materials from their old houses. Efforts to \nminimize resettlement effects have been made after consultations with local officials during the \nsetting of the alignment for the feasibility study to avoid towns, villages, and high-yield paddy \nand fruit gardens.  \n4.  In the project area, the per capita land holding is very small (less than 0.05 ha), so land \nacquisition will have significant impact on the income and livelihood of the project-affected \n                                                 \n1 The  resettlement  plans  are  in  English  and  Chinese  and  available  on  ADB\u2019s  website: \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/Resettlement_Plans/PRC/Sichuan-Roads-Development/default.asp. ", "60   Appendix 16 \npeople. To mitigate such impacts, higher-than-average compensation rates are provided and \ndetailed  economic  rehabilitation  plans  for  seriously  affected  villages  will  be  developed.  All \nproject-affected people will either be compensated directly or, if preferred, given replacement \nland  through  village  land  readjustment  to  ensure  that  all  project-affected  households  have \nsufficient land to farm. Project-affected people will use the compensation funds to improve farm \nconditions, develop cash crops, and various nonfarm activities based on consultation. The \nresettlement entitlements will be provided to people before ground clearance and demolition. \nThe resettlement plan provides for moving allowances to assist the affected people during the \ntransition. Expressway contractors will be requested by SPCD to give priority to resettlement-\naffected households in the allocation of unskilled jobs during construction.  \n5.  A project resettlement office (PRO) within SPCD and/or the Implementing Agency will \ncoordinate  the  planning,  implementation,  financing,  and  reporting  of  resettlement  for  the \nexpressway, connector roads, and local poverty roads. Leading groups and resettlement offices, \neach comprising 6\u20138 staff members, will be established in two cities and five project-affected \ncounties. The county resettlement offices will take primary responsibility for the consultation, \nimplementation, and timely delivery of entitlements, with assistance from concerned township \nand villages. Land acquisition will commence by January 2006 and be completed by December \n2006. Housing demolition and relocation will be carried out from March 2006 to December 2006. \n6.  An  estimated  4,500  Yi  people  will  be  affected  by  the  Project  (22%  of  the  total \npopulation). Among the 93 project-affected villages, 38 have over 10% Yi. Although the Yi have \nbeen closely integrated into the social system with no distinctive isolation or barriers, in order to \nrespect their cultural customs and maintain their social relationships, all project-affected minority \npeople will be resettled in the same villages and village groups. For economically vulnerable \npeople, including the Yi, the elderly living alone, the disabled, households headed by women, \nand extremely poor households with incomes below CNY675 per year, the Project will provide \nadditional financial and physical support. Households that face hardships will receive additional \nassistance to ensure they can fully restore their livelihoods and living conditions in a timely \nmanner. For this purpose, the resettlement plan includes a special fund with 1.0% to 1.5% of \ntotal resettlement cost.  \n7.  The PRC Land Law and regulations require disclosure and consultation with people \naffected. The people affected have been notified about the key elements of the resettlement \nplan during meetings and interviews. A resettlement information booklet was distributed to all \nproject-affected townships and villages in February 2005. The information booklet contains the \nresettlement scope, expected time frame, compensation rates for land and other assets, other \nassistance to replace assets, relocation and economic rehabilitation strategies, and grievance \nredress mechanisms. During detailed resettlement planning, there will be further consultations \narranged by township and village officials to discuss specific impacts in each village and how to \naddress them. In case of grievance, all complaints will be processed based on the Government \nRegulation 431 on Grievance and Redress.  \n8.  SPCD will engage a qualified domestic monitoring agency to carry out independent \nresettlement monitoring and evaluation and ascertain the extent to which the project-affected \npeople have (i) received their full entitlements on time; and (ii) fully restored their livelihoods, \nincome levels, and living standards. The independent monitoring agency will provide ADB and \nSPCD with copies of the monitoring and evaluation reports to be prepared twice a year during \nresettlement implementation and once a year after resettlement completion. A monitoring and \nsupervision system will be established in the PRO of the SPCD or Implementing Agency and will \nreport progress to ADB quarterly. After completion of land acquisition and resettlement, SPCD or \nthe Implementing Agency will prepare a resettlement completion report and submit it to ADB.
