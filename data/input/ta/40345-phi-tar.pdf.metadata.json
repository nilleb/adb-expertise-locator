During the March 2007 Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program \nconfirmation discussions with the Government of the Philippines, the National Economic and \nDevelopment Authority (NEDA) requested follow-on technical assistance (TA) for the 2004 TA \nfor Strengthening Provincial and Local Planning and Expenditure Management. The TA was to \nbe completed in June 2007, with closure by the end of November 2007.1 The Government \nreiterated  this  request  at  the  October  2007  programming  update  with  ADB.  Strengthening \nProvincial  and  Local  Planning  and  Expenditure  Management,  Phase  2  is  included  in  the \nPhilippines country operations business plan for 2007\u20132008. Preparatory work and consultation \nwas undertaken and a fact-finding mission fielded from 15 to 19 November 2007. The mission \nreached an understanding with the Government on the TA objectives, scope, cost estimates, \nfinancing, and implementation arrangements. The TA builds on the ADB-World Bank joint report \non decentralization2 and the ongoing dialogue on the Local Government Finance and Budget \nReform Program.3 The TA framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The ADB-World Bank joint study on decentralization (2005) and the latest compilation of \nlocal governance studies by Arsenio Balisacan and Hal Hill (2007) share similar findings, that \n\u201cwhile the decentralization program has more or less \u2018worked\u2019, there is an urgent need for a \nclear, predictable and stable regulatory environment governing the administrative and financial \nrelations  between  the  centre  and  the  regions.\u201d5  Moreover,  institutional  and  technical  links \nbetween the plans and programs of local government units (LGUs) and national programs and \npriorities need to be strengthened in the medium-term Philippines development plan. \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program recognizes this gap and supports the Government\u2019s \ndecentralization and local governance agenda. It also identifies the local government finance \nand budget reform program as a critical operation to (i) reduce local government dependence \non national government transfers by improving resource mobilization and budget operations, \nand (ii) enhance the sustainability of fiscal consolidation by strengthening the LGUs\u2019 ability to \ndeliver improved services despite resource constraints.6 The reform program recognizes the \nneed for LGUs to strengthen and coordinate their development planning, institutionalize proper \nbudgeting using approved plans and targets, and enhance their resource mobilization capacity. \nIt also commits to support improved planning, budgeting, and finance linkages and strong \nregional development coordination. \n \n4.  To support the Government\u2019s decentralization agenda, ADB provided TA to NEDA\u2019s \nregional development offices to prepare the groundwork for improved local investments and \nservice delivery through harmonized local planning investment programming, financing, and \nbudgeting processes; and strengthened vertical linkages of plans and investment programs \nbetween  various  levels  of  government  (footnote  1).  Under  this  TA,  a  five-volume  set  of \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

Manila, paras. 41\u201343. \n ", "2   \nguidelines  on  provincial  and  local  planning  and  expenditure  management  (PLPEM)  were \nformulated. The guidelines will help the provinces plan more effectively; identify, prepare, and \nprioritize critical programs and projects; and raise and allocate financial resources. In addition, \nthe Government issued a joint memorandum circular (JMC) providing guidelines for harmonizing \nlocal planning, investment programming, revenue administration, budgeting, and expenditure \nmanagement.7 The JMC and the TA output constitute a major contribution to advancing the \ndecentralization agenda supported by the Philippine Development Forum working group on \ndecentralization and local governance.8 \n \n5.  While ADB assessed implementation of the phase 1 TA as \u201cfully satisfactory,\u201d effective \nimplementation  of  follow-on  activities  requires  a  focus  on  key  implementation  lessons:  \n(i) training and capacity building among local government chief executives, officials, and staff is \na continuing process that must be institutionalized with strong commitments from local chief \nexecutives;  (ii)  strong  coordination  and  collaboration  among  local  government  oversight \nagencies (i.e., Department of Budget and Management, Department of Finance, Department of \nInterior and Local Government, and NEDA) is critical for a consistent, efficient, and effective \nlocal  governance  policy,  thus,  JMC  must  be  supported  to  strengthen  its  capacity;  and  \n(iii)  advocacy  activities  must  be  emphasized  to  enhance  wider  acceptance  of  proposed \ninstitutional and policy reforms for good local governance. Building strong local governments \nrequires a long process of sustained reform initiatives; stakeholder ownership and commitment \nto reforms must be strengthened through continued advocacy work.  \n \n6.  The phase 2 TA will use the PLPEM guidelines to produce actual provincial outputs,  \ni.e., provincial development and physical framework plans (PDPFPs), provincial development \ninvestment programs (PDIPs), and feasibility studies of critical projects in the PDIPs. The PDIP \nprograms  and  projects  will  become  inputs  to  the  provincial  budget,  and  be  important \ncomponents of the planning, investment programming, budgeting linkage. The phase 2 TA will \ndeepen the reforms started during the first phase TA and support the JMC principles. \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s  team  for  community  of  practice,  managing  for  development  results,  will \ncomplement  TA  activities  to  strengthen  provincial  and  local  planning  and  expenditure \nmanagement. The team will help bring managing for development results best practice to local \ngovernments and provide a web-based platform to facilitate information flow among participating \nLGUs, government agencies, and the wider network of ADB\u2019s community of practice. Moreover, \nthis TA coordinates and complements World Bank activities to strengthen LGU service delivery \nmechanisms.  This  TA  is  complemented  by  activities  funded  by  German  development \ncooperation through the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u0171r Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), which \nhas committed to financially support preimplementation activities in provinces of the Visayas \nregion.  \n \n                                                 \n7  The memorandum circular was issued as JMC No. 1 series of 2007, signed by the four local government oversight \nagencies: Department of Finance, NEDA, Department of the Interior and Local Government, and Department of \nBudget and Management.  \n8  In  line  with  the  principles  of  the  Paris  declaration  on  Harmonization  and  Aid  Effectiveness,  the  Philippine \nDevelopment Forum is the Government\u2019s primary mechanism for facilitating substantive policy dialogue among \nstakeholders on the country\u2019s development agenda. To facilitate the dialogue, the forum is comprised of seven \nthematic working groups; the working group on decentralization and local governance is one of them. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  overall  impact  of  the  TA  is  to  improve  local  government  public  expenditure \nmanagement by strengthening the links between plans and investment programs across all \nlevels  of  government.  The  TA  aims  to  (i)  increase  provincial  capacity  for  planning  and \nexpenditure management thereby upgrading their governance capabilities, particularly in public \nspending and LGU supervision; and (ii) improve and standardize provincial inputs to regional \nand national plans and investment programs through the transfer of provincial planning skills, \ntools, and techniques using the PLPEM guidelines.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA has five key activities. \n \n10.  Prepare PDPFPs and PDIPs. Using the PLPEM guidelines, the NRO core team of \nNEDA  regional  offices  (NROs)  will  guide  and  assist  the  provincial  PLPEM  core  team  in \npreparing PDPFPs and PDIPs following the synchronized planning, investment programming, \nbudgeting process. \n11.  Conduct  Learning-By-Doing  Workshops.  The  draft  PDPFPs  and  PDIPs  will  be \nreviewed nationally and provincially through regional workshops. Following a review guide, the \nNRO core team will review the plans for consistency with the PLPEM guidelines and the \nregional and national development plans and strategies. At national critiquing sessions, experts \nwill undertake a more in-depth review of the PDPFPs and PDIPs of two provinces per region \n(provinces to be identified by NROs) vis-\u00e0-vis logical consistency and overall clarity.  \n12.  Refine and Adopt the PDPFPs and PDIPs. The NRO core team will guide its provincial \ncounterparts  in  refining  the  PDPFPs  and  PDIPs  based  on  comments  and  suggestions \ngenerated during the regional review workshop and critiquing session. The team will then \nconduct a final review and quality check of the programs and plans prior to their adoption by the \nlocal government councils. Completion of PDPFPs and PDIPs will be synchronized with local \nbudget preparation activities in 2009. \n13.  Prepare Feasibility Studies. The NRO core team will train its provincial counterparts on \nproject evaluation and development and guide preparation of the feasibility study for at least one \nproject in the PDIP. The basis for project selection will primarily be its impact on the province\u2019s \ndevelopment and potential for project funding by the national Government or through official \ndevelopment assistance and other existing financing facilities. The draft feasibility studies will \nundergo the same provincial and national review process undertaken for the PDPFPs and \nPDIPs. The NRO core team will also guide the preparation and packaging of project proposals \nand assist in sourcing funds to finance these projects.  \n14.  Provide  Project  Management  and  Monitoring.  NEDA\u2019s  regional  development \ncoordination staff, supported by a financial and project management specialist, will undertake \nproject  mobilization  activities,  including  designing  a  project  monitoring  system.  They  will \ncoordinate and conduct field visits, and recommend problem-solving sessions as necessary to \naddress implementation delays and gaps.  \n \n ", "4   \n15.  TA implementation has the following assumptions: \n \n(i)  Consistency of future related issuances, guides, and circulars of other oversight \nagencies with the PLPEM guidelines will be discussed and resolved through an \ninteragency committee to harmonize local planning, investment programming, \nrevenue administration, budgeting, and expenditure management (footnote 3).  \n \n(ii)  The  provinces  accept  and  are  committed  to  the  PLPEM  guidelines,  and \nguidelines use is sustainable. \n \n(iii)  The  provinces  are  willing  to  provide  counterpart  resources  as  necessary  to \nproduce the provincial outputs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $850,000 equivalent; ADB will provide $650,000. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will \nfinance the balance of $200,000 by providing office accommodation and facilities, remuneration \nand per diem of counterpart staff, and other support facilities (Appendix 2). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  NEDA will be the Executing Agency. NEDA\u2019s regional development coordination staff will \nmanage the day-to-day project activities to ensure their adherence to project objectives. The \nNRO core teams will provide direct planning assistance to provinces in formulating provincial \noutputs. \n \n18.  The  interagency  committee,  comprising,  Department  of  Budget  and  Management, \nDepartment of Finance, Department of Interior and Local Government, and NEDA will provide a \nvenue for discussing policy-related concerns that may be raised during TA implementation.  \n \n19.  Individual consultants (international and national) will implement the TA activities. ADB \nwill engage the consultants in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time). A total of four international and 24 national person-months of \nconsulting services will be required. The terms of reference for the consulting services with \ndetails on the duration of services are in Appendix 3. The consultants will prepare review guides \nfor PDPFPs, PDIPs, and project evaluation and development for use of the NRO core teams \nduring regional review  workshops; and critique the provincial outputs. The consultants will \nprovide  written  reports  in  English  on  a  regular  basis:  (i)  an  inception  report  to  include  a \ncomprehensive implementation plan; (ii) interim report; (iii) progress reports; and (iv) a draft final \nreport, and subsequently a final report to be submitted before the end of the TA. ADB will \nprocure the required computers (hardware and software) and printers in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The TA will commence in April \n2008 and be implemented over 24 months. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $650,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  Philippines  for  Strengthening  Provincial  and  Local  Planning  and \nExpenditure Management, Phase 2, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data   \nDesign  Performance  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved local  Provincial expenditures reflect  Annual fiscal reports (Bureau  Future related issuances, \ngovernment public  the development priorities and  of Local Government  guides, and circulars of other \nexpenditure  needs of the province  Finance, Department of  oversight agencies are \nmanagement    Budget and Management)  consistent with the provincial \n  Consistency between regional    and local planning and \nand national development  Regional development plans  expenditure management \nplans and investment program  and regional development  (PLPEM) guidelines. \nimproved  investment programs   \n(National Economic and   \nDevelopment Authority  Risk \n[NEDA])  Political changes result in \n  opposition to previously agreed \nMedium-term Philippine  program due to the change in \ndevelopment plan and  local executives due to 3-year \nmedium-term Philippine  election cycle \ninvestment program (NEDA) \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nStronger link between  Beginning from 2009,  Annual investment program  Provinces sustain the use of the \nprovincial plans and  programs, projects, and  and annual provincial budget  PLPEM guidelines in updating \ninvestment programs  activities in provincial  (local government units)  their plans and investment \ndevelopment investment  programs. \nprograms (PDIPs) are drawn \nfrom provincial development \nand physical framework plans \n(PDPFPs) \n \nBeginning from 2009, projects \nreflected in the annual \ninvestment program and \nprovincial budgets are drawn \nfrom PDIPs \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
