Justification \n1.  A project preparatory technical assistance1 is required to prepare: (a) a planning study, \nwhich will recommend the final alignment, standards and phasing for a new Bago-Kyaikto highway \nand an indicative alignment for a new Yangon-Bago link, (b) a feasibility study as well as \nsafeguard documents for the new Bago-Kyaikto highway, on the basis of the alignment and \nstandards selected by the government at the end of the planning study, (c) a pre-feasibility study \nfor the new Yangon-Bago link, and (d) an implementation plan including documentation to support \nADB processing of the subsequent loan for the new Bago-Kyaikto highway. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency \n(JICA) have agreed to cooperate during the preparation of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) \nEast-West Economic Corridor (EWEC) Highway Development Project, which will construct a new \nBago-Kyaikto highway. ADB will be responsible for studies related to the project\u2019s highway \nsections, and JICA will be responsible studies related to the new Sittaung bridge. The ADB-\nfinanced consultant will integrate the findings of the JICA study into the overall feasibility and \nsafeguard reports.  \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n3.
