INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) reconfirmed its request for \ncontinued Asian Development Bank (ADB) support to implement the Social Security Reform \nProgram during the 2003 Country Programming Mission. The Fact-Finding  Mission  visited \nBeijing during 11\u201315 August 2003, and reached an understanding with the Government on the \nobjectives,  scope,  cost,  financing,  and  implementation  arrangements  for  the  technical \nassistance (TA).1 The TA logical framework is in Appendix 1. The Government has assigned \nhigh priority to social security reform due to population aging, poor financial performance of \nstate-owned enterprises (SOEs), linkage to capital market development, and severe financial \nand management stress of the old social security system. The ongoing social security reforms \nare designed to reduce the fiscal burden, remove rigidities in the labor market, and reduce \npoverty by improving social security coverage. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  An important milestone of the social security reform was the promulgation of Document \n26 in 1997 by the State Council, which laid the conceptual framework for a multipillared pension \nsystem to replace the pay-as-you-go scheme.2 The implicit pension debt is large and needs to \nbe  financed  as  part  of  the  reform  program.3  The  National  Social  Security  Fund  (NSSF), \nestablished in September 2000, serves as a supplemental adjustment tool and reserve to cover \nfuture social security expenditures. NSSF was established and entrusted with an initial CNY20 \nbillion of budgetary allocation in December 2000 initially. To manage the funds it has raised, the \ncentral Government administers NSSF through the  National Council for the Social Security \nFund (NaCSSeF). \n \n3.  The NaCSSeF board4 has three committees: for investment, risk management, and \nexpert appraisal. The chair is supported by a secretariat with six departments: administration, \nfinance and accounting, investment, legal and compliance, equity management, and information \nsystems. NaCSSeF manages its own bank deposits and purchase of treasury bonds through \nthe primary market. Investment in stocks, corporate bonds, financial institutions bonds, and \nother fixed-income instruments in the secondary market are to be managed and operated by \noutsourced specialized investment managers. \n \n4.  NaCSSeF\u2019s investment policies are set out in the Provisional Measures on Investment \nManagement of NSSF, issued jointly by the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Labor and Social \nSecurity and adopted at the first annual meeting of NaCSSeF in December 2001. According to \nthe provisional measures, NSSF needs to invest no less than 50% in bank deposits or treasury \nbonds, no more than 10% in corporate bonds and financial institutions bonds, and no more than \n40% in stocks and investment funds.5 NSSF\u2019s holdings are now over CNY120 billion,6 with 98% \nheld in fixed-income instruments and only a small proportion invested in equity markets.7 \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities  (Internet edition) on 4 March 2003. \n2  The pillars are social pooling with individual accounts, enterprise-sponsored schemes, and individual market-based \ninsurance. This structure was also adopted for health insurance. \n3  Implicit pension debt is the total amount of pension obligations that Government needs to cover to make the \npension system actuarially sound, which is estimated at 50\u2013150% of gross domestic product (GDP). \n4  The board is composed of 15 members appointed by the State Council. Five are government representatives from \nthe Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MOLSS), and trade unions; five are regional \nrepresentatives, and five are representatives from the central Government. \n5  Funds allocated from MOF cannot be invested in stocks and investment funds. \n6  The budget allocations during the first year of operations totaled CNY60.7 billion. \n7 The portfolio composition at end-2002 was the following: treasury bonds, 22%; bank deposits, 76%; stocks, more \nthan 1%; and corporate bonds and financial institutions bonds, less than 1%. The return on the portfolio was 2.6%.  \n ", "2    \n5.  The skewed allocation of assets reflects (i) unknown structure of NSSF liabilities,8 hence \nthe impossibility of matching the duration of assets against liabilities; (ii)  uncertainty of future \nfunding;  and  (iii)  concerns  about  the  overvaluation  of  many  stocks  listed  on  domestic \nexchanges, and the underdeveloped corporate bond market.  NaCSSeF has yet to develop a \nwell-stipulated  investment  policy  and  establish  risk  tolerance.  NaCSSeF\u2019s  risk  avoidance \ninvestment policy obviously  cannot be a long-term approach if its objective is to maximize \nreturns on investments. Managing risk requires a portfolio that is diversified across instruments, \nmaturities, and borders. To improve asset-liability management and better manage risks, policy \nbreakthroughs are needed to broaden and deepen the capital markets and improve their \ngovernance, and to enable NaCSSeF to invest part of its assets in markets abroad.9  \n \n6.  State-Owned  Enterprise  Share  Management.  The  Government  envisaged  major \nfunding sources for NSSF to include budget allocations, proceeds earned from divesting state \nshares, state lottery, and issuance of long-term government bonds. Typically, only one third of \nshares of public listed companies are tradable on the stock exchanges and about two thirds are \nin the form of \u201cstate shares\u201d and \u201clegal-person shares\u201d and non-tradable. In June 2001 the State \nCouncil issued the Provisional Rule for Raising Funds for Social Security through Liquidation of \nState Shares and requested for every initial public offer or subsequent rights issues to issue \n10% of state shares in stock exchanges for NSSF funding. However, the market reaction to the \nrule was negative and stock markets dropped significantly. The China Securities Regulatory \nCommission (CSRC) thus called off such practice in October 2001.  \n \n7.  The Government since than has been contemplating other means of liquidating state \nshares, and one proposal is to directly allocate shares to NSSF. NaCSSeF recently established \nthe Equity Management Department to coordinate policy with other government agencies in this \nissue, and eventual management of state shares.10 However, poor financial performance and \npoor corporate governance of SOEs will be a major concern for NSSF. Experiences from other \ncountries show that social security funds are not suitable organizations to manage SOE shares \ndue to potential state interference. Valuation of non-tradable shares may also present a problem \nfor NSSF in assessing their return and actuarial soundness. The soundness of the existing \napproach and a specialized government investment corporation to manage state shares before \nliquidation and transfer of proceeds to NSSF should be assessed. As the most significant \ninstitutional  investor,  however,  NaCSSeF  can  greatly  improve  corporate  governance  by \nexercising its shareholders\u2019 rights. NaCSSeF\u2019s experience will help advance SOE restructuring \nand capital market development reforms.11  \n \n8.  External Investment Managers and Custodians.  In June 2003 NaCSSeF selected, \nthrough  competitive  biddings,  six  fund  management  companies  as  outsourced  investment \nmanagers to manage the NSSF fund.12 Each fund manager has been allocated CNY2 billion\u20133 \nbillion.  NaCSSeF  has  prescribed  a  dozen  investment  mandates  with  specific  portfolio \ncharacteristics regarding instruments, sectors, duration, and risks. The investment managers \n                                                 \n8  MOF and MOLSS are jointly responsible for NSSF\u2019s expenditure policy. The Government has promised not to \ntouch the proceeds from NSSF for the next 5 years, but NaCSSeF wishes this period to be extended to 20 years. \n9 The PRC adopted a framework for qualified foreign institutional investor in 2003 but its reciprocal form, the qualified \ndomestic institutional investor, is still under development. \n10 The department has four divisions: allocation, to coordinate with government agencies in deciding what shares to \nallocate to NaCSSeF; shareholders rights, to exercise shareholder\u2019s ownership rights and represent NaCSSeF in \nenterprise  governance  issues;  operations,  to  oversee  equity  share-related  transactions;  and  the  general \nadministration office. \n11  Given that state shares cannot be traded in the stock exchanges, NaCSSeF either has to hold these state shares \nand receive dividends, or transfer these shares to other strategic investors, or, as some have proposed, eventually \nset up an exchange traded fund similar to that of Hong Kong, China\u2019s Tracker Fund to gradually liquidate SOE \nshares to the capital market. \n12  NaCSSeF does not have a secondary-market license but has to contract fund management companies for \nsecondary-market investments. NaCSSeF has, however, obtained a special license from CSRC as the strategic \ninvestor. ", "      3 \nare obligated to adhere to the portfolio characteristics of the assigned investment mandates; in \nreturn, NaCSSeF pays a management fee at a fixed percentage. \n \n9.  NaCSSeF  has  engaged  two  custodian  banks\u2014Bank  of  China  and  Bank  of \nCommunications13\u2014which  serve  all  payment  and  settlement  operations  of  investment \nmanagers. The banks are also responsible for external investment managers\u2019 daily investment \nposition reports, which are further processed by various NaCSSeF departments to manage risk \nand comply with regulations. Since NaCSSeF does not receive daily reports from investment \nmanagers,  timely  and  accurate  reporting  by  custodian  banks  is  important  for  regulatory \ncompliance, risk management, and performance evaluation.14 No system is in place to detect \nerroneous reporting and cross-checking with  other sources.  Foreign custodian banks have \ncomparative  advantage  in  service  quality,  risk  management,  and  regulatory  compliance. \nHowever, since they do not have full Renminbi licenses, NaCSSeF may have difficulty engaging \nthem now. Perhaps after the World Trade Organization phase-out period when foreign banks \nget full Renminbi licenses, NaCSSeF will be able to choose foreign banks as well. \n \n10.  NaCSSeF is developing a comprehensive risk management and performance evaluation \nframework combined with an on- and off-site monitoring and supervision framework for external \nfund managers and custodians. This will help NaCSSeF monitor compliance of investment \nmanagers in the short run, evaluate and select better investment managers in the medium run, \nand control volatility on risk-adjusted returns for NSSF in the long run. All these are essential for \nNaCSSeF  to  meet  its  investment  and  risk  control  objectives.  The  investment  department \nmonitors  day-to-day  compliance  of  investment  managers  and,  jointly  with  the  legal  and \ncompliance  department,  evaluates  the  performance  of  investment  managers,  focusing  on \noverall risk management. The finance and accounting department monitors and evaluates \ncustodian banks\u2019 performance. \n \n11.  Due to NaCSSeF\u2019s long-term investment objectives, enforcement of managers\u2019 best \npractices will help change the speculative environment and establish investment standards and \nbenchmarks in the capital market. NSSF is not yet structured as a trust.15 External investment \nmanagers are engaged through contracts rather than through trusts.16 NaCSSeF and the \nGovernment should examine together the feasibility of setting NSSF up as a trust, and improve \nits  contract  management  to  safeguard  responsibilities  and  accountabilities  among various \nparties, including using the trust arrangement, to further clarify their legal obligations and \nprotection. NaCSSeF should specify the criteria and selection process for professional external \nmanagers and not interfere in their investment decisions once the contracts are awarded. \n  \n12.  ADB's Operations and Strategy. ADB has been a key partner with the Government in \nproviding  knowledge-based  products  to  support  social  security  reforms17  and  to  build  an \n                                                 \n13  Bank of China is the one of the four state-owned commercial banks, and Bank of Communication is the largest \njoint-stock bank and the fifth largest commercial bank in the PRC, after the four state-owned commercial banks. \n14 Because NaCSSeF receives monthly reports from investment managers, it cannot reconcile reports submitted by \ncustodians. It may involuntarily be in violation against CSRC regulations such as the mandatory report requirement \nfor 5% ownership in a particularly stock.  \n15 Under such trust arrangement, the central Government will be the trustor. The beneficiaries should be the \nprovincial or other social security systems where funding for social security is short. NaCSSeF may be appointed \ntrustee, which would make it accountable by giving it various responsibilities imposed by the Trust Law and other \nobligations imposed by the Government in the trust document, and also entrust NaCSSeF with authority to \nadminister the entrusted assets. \n16 Although the PRC adopted the Trust Law in 2001, no investment fund has ever been created as a trust with well-\ndefined trustee and beneficiary relationships. \n17 ADB. 1998.

The TA team also \nanalyzed the potential impact of NaCSSeF in the PRC capital market. Because of the success \nof the TA, NaCSSeF asked for more assistance. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n13.  The objective of the TA is to strengthen the institutional capability of NaCSSeF by \nestablishing  a  sound  risk  management  framework  supported  by  an  efficient  management \ninformation system to prudently manage external investment managers and custodians, and to \nexamine the soundness of allocating non-tradable state shares to NSSF. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The  scope  of  the  TA  includes  (i)  integrated  risk  management  systems  that  cover \nmanagement of external investment managers and custodians, (ii) a policy and management \nframework  for  non-tradable  state  shares,  and  (iii)  an  efficient  and  secure  management \ninformation system. Specifically, the TA will do the following: \n \n(i)  Strengthen risk management systems for investment managers and custodian \nbanks by (a) developing procedures for day-to-day monitoring and supervision to \nensure adequate adherence to investment mandates and operation guidelines \nand compliance with all relevant banking and securities market regulations; (b) \nfacilitate  effective  and  coordinated  information  exchange  among  various \nstakeholders,  external  and  internal,  and  with  NaCSSeF;  (c)  strengthen \nperformance evaluation and adopt targeted benchmarks; (d) identify legal issues \nin mandated investment contracts and custody contracts, particularly focusing on \nissues of conflicts of interest, connected-party transactions, and moral hazard, \nand discuss the pros and cons of restructuring NSSF as a trust and utilizing \ntrusts vis-\u00e0-vis contracts for external fund managers. \n \n(ii)  Assess the soundness of allocating non-tradable state shares to NSSF and \nexamine the feasibility of establishing a buffer such as a government investment \ncorporation before channeling proceeds to NSSF. Establish strategies and risk \nmanagement guidelines for equity management toward equity investment by (a) \ndeveloping  methodologies  for  risk  control  for  internal  management  and \noutsourced  management,  (b)  developing  operational  procedures  for  different \ntypes  of  equities,  either  of  listed  or  non-listed  companies,  and  (c)  studying \nsuccessful and unsuccessful equity management and investment operations of \nother countries and identify lessons from them. \n \n(iii)  Enhance the quality of the management information system by (a) establishing \nstrategies  to  adopt  adequate  computer  hardware,  software,  and  database \ntechnologies to ensure system integrity and data security; (b) helping select the \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 1995.

Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $720,000 equivalent, including foreign \nexchange  cost  of  $370,000  and  local  currency  cost  of  $350,000  equivalent.  The  foreign \nexchange cost of $370,000 and the local currency cost of $130,000 equivalent for a total of \n$500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will \ncontribute $220,000 in kind (office space, counterpart staff, transportation, and other services). \nDetails of the cost estimates for the three components and the total are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  NaCSSeF will be the Executing Agency. A working group will be established, under the \nleadership of the director general of the NaCSSeF administrative department to work as the \nconsultants\u2019 counterpart. NaCSSeF will provide office space, counterpart staff, transportation, \nand other support, and will arrange appointments for consultants with relevant agencies and \norganizations. \n \n17.  The  TA  will  engage  three  international  consultants  for  a  total  of  6  person-months, \ncomprising  a  risk  management  specialist  (3  person-months),  a  state  share  management \nspecialist (2 person-months), and an information system specialist (1 person-month), with one \nfunctioning as the team leader. Three domestic consultants will have the same expertise as the \ninternational consultants but will be engaged for 3 person-months each. Additional international \nand domestic specialists will be engaged to cover specific technical areas, such as evaluation of \ninternational custodian banks and divestiture of state shares, and will be identified during TA \nimplementation as the need arises. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix \n3. The TA will be tendered to an international firm based on a simplified technical proposal, \nusing the quality- and cost-based selection method. The consultants will be selected and \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. The consultants \nwill procure the equipment to implement the TA in accordance with ADB's  Guidelines for \nProcurement. \n \n18.  The consultants will submit (i) inception reports 2 weeks after their services start, (ii) \ninterim progress reports at appropriate stages of TA implementation, (iii) draft final reports \nbefore  the  conclusion  of  the  contract,  and  (iv)  final  reports  2  weeks  after  incorporating \nNaCSSeF and ADB's comments. All reports have to be submitted in English and Chinese. The \nTA will start in February 2004 and be completed in December 2004. Trainings abroad will be \nselectively  conducted  through  seminars  and  internships  with  major  institutional  investment \ninstitutions. Workshops will be organized near the end of the implementation period to invite \ncomments from international and domestic experts in the field and disseminate TA findings. \n \n \nIV.
