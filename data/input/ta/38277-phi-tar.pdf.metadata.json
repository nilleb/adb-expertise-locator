The Government of the Philippines adopted the 6-year Action Plan for Judicial Reform \n(APJR) in November 2000 to strengthen judicial independence, effectiveness, and efficiency.1  In \n2001, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided technical assistance (TA) to the Government \nto meet these same objectives.2 The recommendations under the ADB TA led the Supreme Court \n(SC) to adopt several key reform initiatives, including actions to improve and decentralize its \nadministrative and financial operations. Subsequently, in response to the Government\u2019s concerns \nthat the judicial reforms would not be as effective if the other pillars of justice were not improved \nas well, the SC oversaw the formation of a new working group (WG) comprising representatives \nfrom four of the five pillars of justice (judiciary, police and law enforcers, prosecutors and public \ndefenders, and corrections system)3 to broaden the reform agenda, and agreed to chair the WG. \n \n2.  During the 2005 Country Strategy and Programming Mission, the Government asked ADB \nto prepare a medium-term reform program for governance and the judicial sector and to develop a \nlonger-term program for the justice sector in coordination with other development partners. The \nnew program, along with a new TA, was included in the 2005\u20132007 Philippine country strategy \nand  program  (CSP)  and  confirmed  at  the  7  March  2006  CSP  confirmation  meeting.  The \nGovernment  requested  the  prompt  processing  of  the  new  TA  to  allow  the  SC  to  begin \nimplementing reforms in the judiciary\u2019s fiscal and administrative operations during the term of the \ncurrent chief justice of the SC, who will retire at the end of 2006. The Government also requested \nan expansion in the scope of the TA to include improvements in the administration of justice. The \nFact-Finding  Mission  in  April  2006  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the \npurpose,  output,  methodology  and  key  activities,  cost  estimates,  and  implementation \narrangements for the TA.4 The TA logical framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  A more trustworthy, effective, and well-governed justice system is predicated on (i) an \nindependent, accountable, and efficient judiciary; and (ii) effective law enforcement. With ADB\u2019s \nsupport, the Philippines has demonstrated significant leadership in developing and implementing \na comprehensive judicial reform agenda under the APJR. However, capacity and budgetary \nconstraints have slowed the pace of reforms. Moreover, the impact of such reforms depends on \nthe effectiveness of other pillars of justice and other government law enforcement agencies,5 \nwhich in turn depend on strong political will to apply the law consistently.  \n \n4.  Fiscal  and  Administrative  Autonomy  of  the  Judiciary.  Although  the  Philippine \nConstitution mandates fiscal autonomy for the judiciary, fulfilling this constitutional mandate has \nbeen a challenge. Judiciary operations are funded primarily from the national budget.6 A one-line \nceiling provided by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) determines the details of \nthe proposed annual budget of the judiciary. However, the release of allotments and cash and the \nreallocation  of  budget  details  are  subject  to  overall  national  government  priorities,  spending \nregulations applied to other government agencies without fiscal autonomy, and DBM review and \napproval. \n \n                                                 \n1   Supreme Court. Republic of the Philippines. 2001. Action Program for Judicial Reform 2001\u20132006 (with supplement).                         \n2  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for Strengthening the Independence of the \nJudiciary (Financed from the Japan Special Fund and Cofinanced by the Government of Japan). Manila (TA 3693-\nPHI). \n3  The fifth pillar of justice is the community. The proposed TA focuses only on the first four pillars. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities  on 30 May 2006.  \n5  In addition to the four pillars of justice, about 23 national government agencies perform quasi-judicial functions and 34 \nhave law enforcement functions.  \n6  The Constitution provides that the judiciary\u2019s budget cannot be reduced in absolute terms, but the judiciary\u2019s share in \nthe national budget has declined from 1.2% in 1998 to less than 1% in 2004.  \n ", " 2       \n \n5.  National budget allocations are augmented by the Judicial Development Fund, which \ncomprises court fees and other revenues collected by the court and contributions from local \ngovernment units (LGUs), made at the discretion of local executives. There are no reliable data \non the amount or type of resource contribution of LGUs. Under the ADB TA, a formula, based on \nlocal  government  ability  and  willingness  to  contribute,  was  developed  to  systematize  LGU \ncontributions and make them nonnegotiable. \n \n6.  There is currently no-judiciary-wide resource management perspective. The budget of the \nappellate and special courts continues to be controlled by the DBM, while the administrative and \nfinancial management functions of the more than 2,000 lower courts are managed centrally by the \nOffice of the Court Administrator (OCA). Centralized administration is inefficient and promotes \nfurther  dependence  on  LGU  funding.  For  example,  lower-court  requests  for  funds  to  make \nbuilding repairs, replace equipment, or pay utility bills must be submitted to and processed by the \nOCA. The backlog of requests results in long delays in payment and often the suspension of key \nservices. To fill gaps in funding, lower courts are often forced to seek alternative assistance from \nLGUs. \n \n7.  To enable the SC to exercise fiscal autonomy, assume core administrative and financial \nmanagement functions, and improve accountability and the delivery of services to the courts, the \nnew administrative structure, systems, and functions developed under the ADB TA and approved \nby the SC in April 2004 must be implemented. Under the reform program, administrative and \nfinancial operations will be decentralized to the SC, appellate and special courts, the Philippine \nJudicial Academy, the Judicial and Bar Council, and the OCA. A Central Court Administrative \nOffice (CCAO) responsible for administrative oversight and a Central Financial Management \nOffice (CFMO) responsible for financial oversight of these decentralized units will be created. \nCore  administrative  and  financial  management  functions  for  the  lower  courts  will  be  further \ndecentralized to between 13 and 19 regional court administrative offices (RCAOs) for all trial \ncourts in the region.  \n \n8.  The SC would like to set up the new CCAO and CFMO and a pilot RCAO at the same time. \nThe SC has chosen Region 7, which has 146 lower courts administratively organized into 89 \nlower-court stations, for the pilot RCAO to take advantage of synergies with the World Bank \nJudicial Reform Support Project, which is setting up a model hall of justice in the region.7 But \nbefore the new structure can be established, a detailed administrative structure, and staffing and \noperating procedures must be prepared and operationalized, and related capacity-building and \nchange management processes must be developed and implemented.  \n \n9.  Delays in the Administration of Justice. Delays in the administration of justice can be \nattributed  to  constraints  in  the  judiciary  and  other  pillars  of  justice.  In  the  judiciary,  case \ncongestion (backlog) and delay in case processing violates the litigants\u2019 rights to a speedy trial \nand erodes public confidence in the courts. Philippine courts continue to be saddled by case \nbacklog, and the docket clearance rates of judges is only 40\u201345%. Studies made under the APJR \nrevealed that up to 33% of pending cases continue to be delayed and generally remain open after \n2 years. The SC therefore drew up a Case Decongestion and Delay Reduction Strategy (2003) \nunder the APJR. A related study showed the need for case-load management reforms and a \nmonitoring framework to track judicial efficiency in this area. Hence, also under the APJR, the SC \ndeveloped a case-flow management system (CFM) in Pasay, which is now being evaluated \nbefore being implemented nationwide. A team of judges, who have successfully developed similar \nsystems in their own courts, are supporting the SC in enhancing the pilot project.  \n                                                 \n7  The project, funded with a loan from the World Bank, provides financing for the implementation of a package of \nreforms, including the development and pilot implementation of computerized integrated administrative and financial \nmanagement systems designed under the ADB TA and to be detailed under the proposed TA. Pilot implementation \nwill cover a pilot court (Lapu Lapu), Region 7 RCAO, CCAO, and CFMO, to enable the vertical integration of the new \nsystems. \n ", "  3\n \n10.  The APJR studies also reviewed the effectiveness of other measures intended to speed \nup  the  administration  of  justice,  including  the  Katarungang  Pambarangay  (Barangay  Justice \nSystem, or BJS). Philippine law requires disputing parties to resort to the BJS before lodging a \ncomplaint in court and imparts the full force and effect of a final court judgment to amicable \nsettlements under BJS, unless they are repudiated in court within 10 days of being handed down. \nHowever, settlements reached through the BJS are often not enforced and the issues discussed \nin the settlement are brought once again before the courts. Judges have no effective way of \nensuring that cases filed before them have previously been settled or have undergone settlement \nproceedings through the BJS.  \n \n11.  A related study also identified the need to address issues related to the effectiveness and \nefficiency of the other pillars of justice to maximize the benefits of strategies to decongest case \nload and reduce delays. The effectiveness and efficiency of prosecutors were identified by the \nstudy as important in this regard. However, without systematic case management, including the \nmanagement of case documents, it is difficult for the National Prosecution Service (NPS) of the \nDepartment of Justice and the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) (for prosecutors it deputizes) to \ntrack the status of probable-cause cases (preliminary investigations) handled by prosecutors. In \naddition, limited access to research materials undermines the ability of the NPS and the Court of \nTax Appeals (CTA) to prepare and try cases. Moreover, new prosecutors working in the NPS are \nnot given regular training and must learn on the job. Other prosecutors are trained ad hoc. Thus, \nprosecutors may lack the requisite skills to prepare specific types of cases.  \n \n12.  While the SC has taken commendable steps to increase judicial efficiency by introducing \ninformation and communication technology (ICT), including an electronic library, CFM software, \nand e-payment systems, because of the limited funds available for capital outlays, most courts still \nlack Internet access and thus cannot use the e-library or submit reports to the SC electronically.  \n \n13.  Poor  coordination  and  collaboration  among  the  four  pillars  of  justice,  especially  in \ninformation sharing, also delays the administration of justice. Core information about persons who \nhave been accused, detained, or convicted is often not readily available. Gaps in the accuracy of \nrequired information often go undetected, resulting in incomplete files. Processes for collecting, \nstoring,  retrieving,  and  sharing  information  often  differ,  resulting  in  duplicative  collection, \ninconsistencies  in  information  collected,  and  delays  in  retrieval. 8  Privacy  and  security  of \ninformation are also concerns.  \n \n14.  Long-Term Strategy for the Justice Sector. The implementation of APJR reforms will be \nevaluated shortly by the SC. The results of the evaluation will be used to update priorities and \nfocus and reprogram resources toward the full implementation of the reforms. A proposed road \nmap for integrated justice sector reforms, based on the recommendations of earlier studies, was \nprepared recently. The recommendations resulting from the evaluation of the APJR need to be \nreconciled with this road map and the implementation issues (capacity and funding constraints) \nneed to be clearly identified and understood so that the reform priorities can be set.  \n \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The TA will promote a more trustworthy, efficient, and well-governed justice system that \nmore effectively upholds the rule of law. Through its outputs, the TA will strengthen judicial \nautonomy, accountability and efficiency, and improve the administration of justice.  \n                                                 \n8  For example, there is no integrated system with data on arrest warrants and convictions that have been issued by the \njudiciary. The National Bureau of Investigation, which prepares clearances, only analyzes information that is provided \nto it. Not all courts report this information to the bureau. Thus, those who want to check whether a particular person \nhas a criminal record may need to go directly to the courts. \n ", " 4       \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The TA will focus on three key reform areas:  \n \n(i)  Fiscal and administrative autonomy of the judiciary. The TA will support the \nimplementation  of  the  judiciary\u2019s  new  administrative  and  fiscal  structure  by \nassisting in developing and implementing (a) the detailed structure, staffing, and \noperating procedures and systems for the new CCAO, CFMO, and a pilot RCAO in \nRegion 7, along with related capacity-building and change management support; \nand (b) a new accountability system within the decentralized framework, including \nan  integrity  unit  within  the  pilot  RCAO.  The  TA  will  also  support  the  pilot \nimplementation in Region 7 of the formula standardizing LGU contributions to the \njudiciary.  \n(ii)  Administration of justice. The TA will help improve the overall management of \ninformation  coming  from  all  pillars  of  justice,  to  increase  efficiency  and \naccountability  (in  the  work  of  the  judiciary,  to  start  with),  by  developing  the \nframework for a national justice information system (NJIS) and the related ICT \nframework. The TA will identify the core information needs and develop business \nprocesses  to  facilitate  the  collection,  storage,  retrieval,  and  sharing  of  core \ninformation, while addressing security and privacy concerns. It will also assist in (a) \nimplementing  the  CFM  for  the  judiciary  in  Region  7,  (b) developing  business \nprocesses and systems to integrate the BJS into the judicial process in Region 7, \n(c) improving communications and connectivity among the courts by providing Wi-\nFi  antennas  in  courts  with  adequate  information  technology  infrastructure, \n(d) giving the judiciary and NPS better access to research materials needed to \ndevelop cases (Web-based), and (e) developing a case management system to \ntrack  the  status  of  probable-cause  cases  assigned  to  prosecutors,  including \nprosecutors deputized by the OMB to handle cases of corruption. The TA will \nassist  as  well  in  developing  a  sustainable  capacity  development  strategy  for \nprosecutors, including funding options.  \n(iii)  Long-term  strategy  for  the  justice  sector.  The  TA  will  focus  on  facilitating \nagreement  on  a  uniform  approach  to  reform  in  the  justice  sector  in  close \ncoordination  with  other  development  partners.  To  this  end,  it  will  (a)  assess \nstrategic long-term frameworks that have been prepared for the sector, (b) review \nrelated initiatives of other development partners, (c) facilitate agreement with the \nGovernment and other development partners on the reform agenda, (d) develop \nshort- and long-term strategic funding initiatives and prioritize and cost specific \ninvestments,  (e)  determine  the  appropriate  timing  and  sequencing  of  various \nactions and clarify implementation arrangements, and (f) develop a performance \nmonitoring system that includes benchmarks and indicators to track progress in \nimplementation.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.15 million equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $800,000 equivalent. The TA will be funded on a grant basis by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the \nbalance of $350,000 by providing office accommodations, remuneration and per diem of staff, \nconference and training facilities, and equipment and furniture for new offices. (See Appendix 2 \nfor the proposed Table of Cost Estimates). \n ", "  5\n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  SC will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the TA and the SC program management office \n(PMO), NPS, and OMB will be the Implementing Agencies (IAs). The WG, chaired by the PMO, \nwill oversee the implementation of the NJIS component, in close coordination with other justice \nsector agencies. The Outline Terms of Reference for Consultants (Appendix 3) gives the specific \ntasks to be overseen by each IA, the support to be given to other pillars of justice, and the role of \nthe WG.  \n19.  The TA will start in August 2006 and end in October 2007. It will have two components: \ncomponent A will focus on reforms relating to the fiscal and administrative autonomy of the \njudiciary, and component B will deal with reforms in the administration of justice and the long-term \nstrategy for the justice sector. A total of 76 person-months of consulting services\u201410 person-\nmonths  of  international  consultants  and  66  person-months  of  national  consultants\u2014will  be \nrequired to implement the reform activities. \n20.  Component  A  will  require  39  person-months  of  national  consultants:  a  fiscal  and \nadministrative  reform  expert  and  coordinator  (5  person-months),  and  experts  in  budgeting \nsystems  (6  person-months),  financial  management  systems  (4  person-months),  revenue \nmanagement  systems  (8  person-months),  physical  assets  management  (4  person-months), \nhuman resource development (7 person-months), and organizational development (5 person-\nmonths).  Component  B  will  comprise  10  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  27 \nmonths of national consultants. The international consultants will be the team leader and justice \nsector reform expert (5 person-months) and experts in case management (2 person-months) and \njustice information systems (3 person-months). The domestic experts, on the other hand, will have \nexpertise  in  case  management  (3  person-months),  case  management  systems  and  process \nreengineering  (5  person-months),  justice  information  communications  technology  (5  person-\nmonths), information systems (2 person-months), legal and judicial reform (8 person-months), \ntraining (2 person-months), and poverty reduction (2 person-months). (Outline terms of reference \nfor all of these consultants are in Appendix 3).  \n21.  Consistent with sections 2.29\u20132.32 of ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, CPRM \nConsultants, Inc., which was hired for TA 3693-PHI (footnote 2), will also be hired to implement \ncomponent  A,  according  to  ADB\u2019s  single-source  selection  method,  to  ensure  continuity  and \nconsistency. The members of the consulting team, who performed very well under the previous \nTA, are already familiar with the judiciary\u2019s new fiscal and administrative structure through their \nwork  in  developing  and  assisting  the  SC  in  adopting  the  reforms,  and  have  an  excellent \nrelationship with the SC and the affected agencies within the SC. They are therefore best placed \nto  continue  their  work  under  this  TA.  Single-source  selection  would  also  enable  the \nimplementation of key reforms during the term of the present chief justice, as he has requested. \nThe consultant to be directly selected will prepare a bio-data technical proposal and a financial \nproposal. \n22.  In component B, the consultants will be recruited through a firm through the quality- and \ncost-based selection method and on the basis of a simplified technical proposal. All consultants \nwill be selected and hired by ADB according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of the Philippines for Enhancing the Autonomy, Accountability, and Efficiency of the \nJudiciary, and Improving the Administration of Justice, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact   Shorter period from  PMO reports  Assumptions \nA more trustworthy,  case filing to resolution     Macroeconomic and political \nefficient, and well-   Annual report of the SC  stability \ngoverned justice  Improved public     \nsystem that more  perception of the  SC judicial independence  Continued commitment and \neffectively upholds the  judiciary and justice  indicators (developed by  participation of justice sector \nrule of law   sector  the American Bar  agencies and local \n    Association)   government units in justice \n  Successful criminal    sector and governance \n  prosecution of cases of  Public surveys  reforms \ntax evasion and     \ncorruption    Participation of civil society \n  and other stakeholders \n \nRisks \nPoor coordination among \npillars of justice \n \nLack of funds for reform \nagenda \n \nLack of capacity and slow \npace of reforms in human \nresource management \n \nLeadership changes \nOutcome      Assumptions \nMore autonomous,  Quicker response to  PMO and SC reports  Continued ownership of    \naccountable, and  financial and    reforms and leadership in \nefficient judiciary, and  administrative needs of  ADB reports and reviews  their implementation \nimproved administration  the courts      \nof justice       Proactive and reform-\n   Less case congestion     minded PMO \n   \nGovernment able to recruit \nand retain competent staff \n \nTimely provision of \nresources for capacity \nbuilding and institutional \ndevelopment \n \nRisk \nJustice sector agencies \nunwilling to implement \nreforms at the same time \n ", "Appendix 1  7\nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nOutputs       \n       \n1.
