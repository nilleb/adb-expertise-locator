INTRODUCTION \n1.   The Government of Azerbaijan requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for the development of the microfinance sector. In response, ADB \nproposed a TA project to prepare a diagnostic assessment of the microfinance sector and a \ndevelopment strategy to serve as a basis for improvements in the policy, legal, regulatory and \ninstitutional framework of the microfinance sector. ADB has reached an understanding with the \nGovernment on the objectives, scope, terms of reference, cost estimates, financing plan, and \nimplementation arrangements for the TA.1 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.   The  Context.  Since  1995,  Azerbaijan  has  managed  to  pursue  macroeconomic \nstabilization and structural reforms that have yielded good results.  On a positive note, real \ngross domestic product (GDP) growth has been strong, and there has been a significant degree \nof economic and monetary stability. However, the benefits of economic growth have not trickled \ndown to the poor or raised the living standards for most of the population. This is largely \nbecause of lack of diversification of production base. The production of the oil sector contributed \nonly 1% to employment generation even though it accounts for 62% of the increase in GDP over \nthe last 5 years. Census data (1999) estimates unemployment rate to be about 16%. Based on \nan absolute poverty line of AZM120,000 (about $25) per capita per month, poverty incidence is \nreported to be 49%. Adding to the ranks of the poor are the large numbers of refugees and \ninternally displaced persons (IDPs), estimated to be about 12% of the population. \n   \n3.  Recognizing these issues, the Government has taken a few important initiatives. Notable \nis the land reforms that have helped redistribute 1.3 million hectares of land to rural residents. \nDeveloping agriculture remains crucial for economic and regional development, as about 40% of \nthe workforce is employed in this sector. Improved accessibility of finance at competitive rates \nwill also promote the development of micro and small enterprises (MSEs) that are generally \nconducive to generating employment.  \n \n4.  The  Government\u2019s  2002  Poverty  Reduction  Program  aims  to  provide  an  enabling \nenvironment for the growth of income-generating opportunities and improvement in the living \nconditions of the rural population, especially of the refugees and IDPs. To achieve this objective, \nthe Government calls for (i) expanding the banking network by establishing financial institutions \nin the regions and (ii) creating conditions for the development of microfinance institutions (MFIs) \nto provide loans to individuals and MSE. \n  \n5.  Overview of Microfinance and Rural Credit.  In Azerbaijan the outreach of MFIs is \nlimited. The operating MFI are largely managed by international nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) and serve barely 20,000 borrowers. Consequently, the poor and micro-borrowers have \nvirtually no access to credit and demand for rural credit is not met adequately.  Many MFIs \nprovide credit to refugees and IDPs, and offer loans for start-up enterprises normally entailing a \nhigh risk of default.  They depend on aid agency funds for onlending and are structured to \nsubsidize  the  high  cost  of  credit  administration.    While  the  MFIs  have  a  good  record  of \nrepayment, they will remain financially unsustainable unless they are transformed into formal \nfinancial institutions and allowed to generate their own sources of financing.  \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in December 2002. ", "2 \n6.  Credit Unions. Previous efforts to form credit unions (CUs) have not been successful. \nOf 128 CUs formed under provisional regulations,  only 28 are operating with a total loan \nportfolio of only AZM3.2 billion ($631,000).  Recently, a new law on CUs has been adopted. A \nrestrictive feature of the law is the lack of an enabling provision that would allow CUs to accept \ndeposits.  This  provision  has  constrained  the  development  of  CUs  as  effective  financial \nintermediaries and lending is mainly financed from equity contributions or grant financing from \nforeign donors. The CUs have evolved merely as external fund disbursing agents.  Even this \nrole has been constrained by the imposition of a high capital adequacy ratio of 25%.  The \ndevelopment of CUs as effective rural financial intermediaries is unlikely unless legislation is \namended. Regulatory provisions should also be strengthened to ensure the financial soundness \nof CUs. \n \n7.  The Commercial Banking Sector. The Azeri banking sector is dominated by the state-\nowned International Bank of Azerbaijan, which is the best positioned bank with a very high \nshare of the deposit and credit market. The remaining commercial banks are small and owned \nby  different  corporate  groups. These banks are unable to mobilize significant amounts of \ndeposits, and perform limited financial intermediation role in the rural economy. With a high level \nof nonperforming loans, it is unlikely that commercial banks will direct their lending operations to \nrural/micro lending which is perceived to be highly risky. The new Microfinance Bank?  recently \nestablished and capitalized by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the \nInternational Finance Corporation, Black Sea Trade and Development Bank, and LFS Financial \nSystems? is expected to become an important player in small and medium-size enterprise \nlending. However, its average loan size is significantly higher than that of MFIs and loans \nrequire full collateralization. This bank is not expected to cater to the poor client base of MFIs \nand will be a normal commercial bank focusing on small and medium-size enterprises. \n \n8.  Absence  of  a  Microfinance  Strategy.  The  development  of  microenterprises  as \nincorporated in the Government\u2019s 2002 poverty reduction program is the most promising way of \nproviding the poor with economic opportunities for increased income and employment. While \nthe Government\u2019s poverty reduction program considers microfinance as an effective instrument \nin reducing poverty and creating economic opportunities, a comprehensive rural microfinance \ndevelopment strategy remains to be developed.  \n \n9.  There is no clear legal definition of microfinance in Azerbaijan. Policy is restrictive; \ndeposit taking by MFIs and CUs is prohibited. The legal and regulatory framework is inadequate \nto  support  the  development  of  a  financially  viable  system  based  on  local  financial \nintermediation. There are no formal financial institutions that can mobilize deposits and lend \nthem to enterprises and individuals in rural areas. As a result, only a small range of financial \nservices is available to support income-generating activities and microenterprise development. \nDevelopment of sustainable MFI is difficult without an appropriate microfinance strategy that \nwould dictate the type and nature of operations of MFIs and other possible institutions, capacity \nbuilding requirements, enabling legislation, and accompanying regulations. \n \n10.  Restrictive Legal and Regulatory Framework. In view of the weakness in the banking \nsector and the prevailing high level of nonperforming loans, policy makers and bank regulators \nhave focused on ensuring the safety and soundness of the banking sector. Creation of an \nenvironment for effective rural financial intermediation has traditionally received low priority. The \nlegal regulatory framework for MFI is non-existent. The only provision issued is \u201cOn Granting \nLicense to Credit Organizations and their Branches and on Organization of their Operations\u201d as \nan addendum to Regulations No. 1 of the central bank, dated 9 November 1996. The special \nlicense issued is for conducting limited banking operations. MFIs and CUs are not mandated to ", "    3 \nattract deposits. Legislation should establish the legal character of MFIs, regulatory provisions \nto set standards of operations, eligibility to take deposits based on the scale of operations, and \nthe manner of transforming MFIs into formal banking institutions. \n \n11.  Unless CUs are allowed to generate resources through deposits, their role as self-help \norganizations providing a range of financial services to members cannot be realized. Legal \nprovisions that would allow CUs to mobilize deposits should be accompanied by institution-\nbuilding measures to ensure that depositors are protected and sound credit operations are \nattained. \n \n12.  Regulations and supervision for the microfinance sector are new in most countries. In \nAzerbaijan, where new institutional forms of microfinance are being established, experience in \nsupervision is limited. The passage of appropriate legislation and promulgation of regulatory \nprovisions should be accompanied by capacity building for the regulatory body.  \n \n13.  Microfinance Sector Strategy and Its Action Plan. Given the issues facing the rural \nand microfinance sector, the Government is keen to develop a microfinance policy and strategy \nincluding a review of the sector, the limitations on deposit services, business opportunities for \nand constraints on the poor, as well as weaknesses in the business climate and administrative \nbarriers.  Besides a diagnostic assessment of the demand of microborrowers and MSEs for \nfinancial services, there is need to study the feasibility of MFIs operating in rural areas, and to \ndevelop a rural finance strategy to determine the appropriate forms that could attract investors, \ndepositors, and creditors.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n14.  The goal of the TA is to reduce poverty through broadening and deepening of the \noutreach of MFIs.  The purpose is to create a microfinance development strategy that provide a \nsound  policy,  institutional,  legal,  and  regulatory  environment  for  micro  and  rural  finance \ninstitutions to permit them to offer a wide range of financial services in a sustainable manner. \nThis goal is in line with the strategic objective of ADB's assistance to Azerbaijan and addresses \none of the strategic focuses of the program, which is assistance to agriculture and rural \ndevelopment activities. \n \n15.  The expected TA outputs are as follows: \n(i)  prepare a microfinance and rural finance development strategy based on a \ndiagnostic assessment of MFIs and the rural financial sector; \n(ii)  provide recommendations to develop laws and regulations for MFIs and CUs and \nto enable the establishment of possible new institutional forms; \n(iii)  develop approaches to supervision and regulation of MFIs and CUs; and \n(iv)  identify a possible follow-up project to further promote the growth of MFIs and the \nrural financial sector. \n ", "4 \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  The TA will \n \n(i)  undertake a  rural financial market survey through field interviews of randomly \nselected  residents  in  selected  regions  to  evaluate  the  demand  for  financial \nservices in the regions; \n(ii)  produce a diagnostic assessment of MFIs to assess their outreach, operational \nprocedures, and financial sustainability; \n(iii)  study a sample of existing CUs to evaluate the nature of financial operations and \ndetermine capacity-building requirements; \n(iv)  provide  policy  makers  with  background  on  the  international  experience  on \nregulation  of  MFIs,  with  special  emphasis  on  the  role  of  central  bank  in \nmicrofinance;  \n(v)  examine the existing Azeri laws and prudential regulations governing MFIs, CUs, \nand other forms of rural nonbank financial institutions, and discuss amendments \nto strengthen them; \n(vi)  assess the operation of the regulatory agency and deliver a capacity-building \nprogram to strengthen supervisory capacity; and \n(vii)  develop inputs and insights for a concept paper on a proposed follow-up project \nto promote the growth of the sector. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The estimated total cost of the TA is $500,000 equivalent, comprising $297,000 in \nforeign exchange and $203,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance the entire foreign exchange cost of $297,000 and $103,000 equivalent of the \nlocal currency costs.  The TA will be financed on a  grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram. Detailed cost estimates and a financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The Ministry of Economic Development (MED) will be the Executing Agency for the TA. \nAn  Interagency  Coordination  Committee  will  be  established  to  coordinate  and  ensure  the \nparticipation  of  different  stakeholders.  The  committee,  comprising  the  National  Bank  of \nAzerbaijan,  MED,  NGO  Association,  Credit  Union  Association,  aid  agencies,  and  other \nstakeholders, will meet with ADB and the consultants at least three times (inception, mid review, \nand final meeting). The chairman of the committee will be nominated by the Government. MED \nwill provide the necessary office support, counterpart staff, transportation, and other services to \nthe consultants. ADB will review and monitor the implementation of the TA through missions \nand consultants\u2019 reports.  \n \n19.  At the beginning of the project a brainstorming meeting with all relevant stakeholders will \nbe held to discuss problems and obstacles to the development of the sector. The preliminary \nfindings of the diagnostic assessment of MFIs and the rural financial sector will be discussed in \na workshop to include key stakeholders. The views and opinions of the participants,  where \nappropriate, will be incorporated into the diagnostic assessment. Using the findings of the \ndiagnostic approach, the consultants will produce a microfinance and rural finance development \nstrategy.   \n ", "    5 \n20.  ADB will assemble a team of individual consultants (detailed terms of reference are in \nAppendix 3) to implement the TA. The international consultants (9 person-months) will include a \nrural/microfinance specialist and a regulatory/supervision specialist. Three domestic consultants \nwith microfinance experience will be engaged for 28 person-months. The consultants will be \nselected  and  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants. \nConsultants will submit (i) inception reports 3 weeks after the start of their services; (ii) interim \nprogress reports at appropriate stages of TA implementation; (iii) draft final reports before the \nconclusion of the contract; and (iv) final reports 2 weeks after incorporating comments of the \nMED and ADB. The TA is expected to begin in June 2003 and to be completed in June 2004. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan for Microfinance Sector Development, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \nReduce poverty   Poverty incidence  Project  Government \n  indicators  completion  commitment to \n  report  develop sustainable \n  microfinance sector \nADB missions  as part of the poverty \nreduction program \ncontinues. \n \nStable political and \nmacroeconomic \nenvironment. \nPurpose       \nProvide a sound policy,  MFI outreach indicators  Project  Government \ninstitutional, legal, and    completion  commitment to \nregulatory environment for    report  implement a sound \nmicro and rural finance      microfinance sector \ninstitutions to permit them to    ADB missions  strategy, develop/ \noffer a wide range of financial    strengthen \nservices in a sustainable  microfinance \nmanner.   institutions, and \n  amend existing legal \nand regulatory \nframework exists. \n \nOutputs       \nMicrofinance development  Draft laws and  Quarterly  Government \nstrategy  regulations to establish/  reports and  acceptance of the \n  strengthen institutions  project  proposed strategy, \n  providing microfinance  completion  including legal, \n  services  report  regulatory, and \n      institutional \n      requirements \n       \nRecommendations to draft  Amendments to the  Ministry of  Aid agencies to \nappropriate legislation and set  relevant laws and  Economic  clearly delineate \nof revised, updated regulations  regulations proposed  Development  areas where \ngoverning operations of MFIs    (MED) reports,  assistance will be \nand Credit Unions (CUs)     ADB missions  provided and to avoid \n      overlapping TAs. \nProgram design to build  Adequate procedures  Consultants\u2019   \ninstitutional capacity to  established to carry out  reports \nproperly supervise MFIs, CUs  active supervision of   \n  MFIs, CUs, and other ", "  Appendix 1  7 \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \n  financial institutions \n    \nIdentification of a possible  MFI supervision unit \nfollow-up project  fully staffed and trained \n  according to plan \n \n \nActivities       \nSurvey of MFIs and CUs  Reports and  Timely recruitment of \n  project  consultants \nDiagnostic assessment of rural  completion \nfinancial institutions  report \n   \nReview of the relevant legal  ADB missions \nand regulatory framework   \n  Consultants\u2019 \nReview of international  reports \nexperience in regulating MFIs \n \nWorkshops \n \nConsultations and meetings \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n                 \nForeign  Local  Total \n Item  Exchange   Currency  Cost \nA.
