INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  proposed  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the \nGovernment of Mongolia to (i) establish a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) management institution1 \nwith proper governance and accountability mechanism, and (ii) provide a capacity development \nprogram for required skills and staff. During the country programming mission in November 2016, \nthe government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide TA to establish a SWF \nmanagement institution. The reconnaissance mission team visited Ulaanbaatar and met with \nofficials from the Ministry of Finance (MOF) from 27 to 30 March 2017, during which they agreed \non the impact, outcome, outputs, cost estimates, financing plan, implementation arrangements, \nand terms of reference for consultants. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \nThe TA is closely aligned with the country partnership strategy and has been included in the \ncountry operations and business plan, 2017\u20132019 for Mongolia.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Mongolian economy, traditionally based on livestock herding, has started to grow and \ntransform  rapidly  because  of  the  discovery  of  large  mineral  deposits  and  the  consequent \ndevelopment of a booming mining industry. The recent pattern of growth has been largely \ndependent  on  commodity  prices;  the  reliance  on  mineral  exports  has  made  the  economy \nvulnerable to the risks associated with commodity price volatility, resulting in relatively short \neconomic boom-and-bust cycles. In resource-abundant countries, an SWF can be an effective \ntool for prudent fiscal policy management, acting as a short- and medium-term stabilization \nmechanism as well as a long-term savings mechanism.4 \n \n3.  Since 2007, Mongolia has established several funds in attempts to establish an effective \nmechanism to function as an SWF by accumulating portions of mining revenues. The Human \nDevelopment Fund (HDF) was established in accordance with the Human Development Fund \nLaw, 2009 and the Fiscal Stability Fund (FSF) in accordance with the Fiscal Stability Law, 2010.5 \nWhile the HDF and the FSF functioned effectively as fiscal stabilization and social protection \nmechanisms, long-term savings for intergenerational equity were created. Since revenues from \nfinite natural resources need to be saved for the needs of future generations, the MOF established \nthe  Sovereign  Wealth  Fund  Division  to  develop  an  institutional  and  legal  framework  that \ntransforms the existing HDF and FSF into an effective and fully functioning SWF, which was \nnamed the Future Heritage Fund (FHF).6 This new fund will function not only as a fiscal stability \nmechanism, but also as an intergenerational fund. The SWF will need to be independently and \n                                                \n1  Sovereign wealth fund management institution refers to a state-owned entity which is entrusted by the government \nto professionally manage and invest assets accumulated in a sovereign wealth fund.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 June 2017. \n3  ADB. 2017. Country Partnership Strategy: Mongolia, 2017\u20132020. Manila; ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business \nPlan: Mongolia, 2017\u20132019. Manila. \n4  There is no universal definition for sovereign wealth fund. It is commonly defined as a state-owned pool of money \ncreated for macroeconomic purposes. Sovereign wealth funds are for holding, investing, and managing assets in line \nwith predetermined investment strategies to achieve financial objectives. \n5   The HDF was established to transform nonrenewable natural resources into assets yielding sustained returns for \nequal distribution among citizens. Since 2010, 70% of royalties collected from all mining companies and dividends \nhave been placed in the HDF. The HDF has been used to finance social benefits of Mongolian citizens. The FSF \nwas established to ensure medium- and long-term fiscal stability. Excess revenues caused by higher mineral prices \nduring the boom period are accumulated in the FSF to make up for structural fiscal deficit. The FSF\u2019s assets need to \nbe maintained above 5% of gross domestic product in any fiscal year, and the central bank is in charge of the FSF\u2019s \nasset management. \n6  The Parliament passed the FHF Law on 5 February 2016, and it was published in the ninth edition of the State \nGazette. The FHF was enacted on 1 January 2017.  \n ", "2   \nprofessionally managed without being affected by political influence. Through a series of TA \nprojects, ADB has provided institutional support, including capacity building and policy advisory \nassistance, to the MOF. The first TA project, Managing for Development Results,7 was approved \nin 2010 and supported the MOF to (i) learn from international good practices in existing SWFs in \nother mineral-dependent economies, and (ii) develop a proper legal and institutional framework \nfor the SWF in Mongolia. The second TA project, Public Finance Resource Management,8 was \napproved in 2013 and supported the MOF in (i) drafting the FHF Law to support the reform of the \nHDF into an effective SWF in Mongolia, (ii) setting up a capacity development road map and \nproviding necessary training programs for MOF staff, and (iii) preparing a long-term development \nplan and strategy for the SWF. At present, the MOF is mandated to do the following for the SWF \nmanagement institution: (i) formulate a framework; (ii) set up and staff the management team; \nand (iii) develop a comprehensive business plan and core guiding documents, including an \ninvestment mandate, a proper governance and accountability mechanism plan, and a short-term \nand medium-term strategy. \n \n4.  According to the FHF Law passed in 2016, the FHF will be effective upon clearing all \noutstanding debts of the former HDF, which were estimated to be approximately MNT947 billion \nas of 31 December 2015.9 The FHF is expected to be an intergenerational savings fund with $100 \nmillion\u2013$200 million being deposited into it annually from mineral revenues and royalties. In \naccordance with the law, assets of the FHF and FSF  will be managed by an investment \nmanagement institution established pursuant to the FHF Law. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  ADB\u2019s previous two SWF TA projects in Mongolia have successfully supported  the \ngovernment in (i) transforming the HDF to the FHF with proper governance and accountability \nmechanism, and (ii) developing the needed capacity to establish the SWF management institution. \nBuilding on past achievements and lessons, Mongolia will need to further upgrade its SWF \nmanagement mechanism as part of the public financial resource management system so it can \nefficiently respond to fundamentally changing economic environments. This will help in promoting \nsustainable and inclusive economic growth. Based on the road map provided under the previous \nTA projects to support the SWF, the proposed knowledge and support TA aims to continue its \nsupport for the government to establish a SWF management institution as the next step. To \naccomplish this, the government needs to (i) build the strategic and operational plan for the SWF \nmanagement institution; (ii) develop a comprehensive business plan and core guiding principles \nfor the establishment of the SWF management institution; and (iii) raise the level of institutional \ncapacity in line with international best practices, especially with those of mineral-rich economies, \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Managing for Development Results. Manila. \n8  ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Public Finance Resource Management. Manila. \n9  Given current applicable gross revenue collection of approximately $135 million per annum, the HDF\u2019s outstanding \ndebts should be cleared by 2020, with FHF assets becoming positive from that time onwards. The revenues collected \nand accumulated in the FHF consist of the following: \n(i)  65% of all royalty payments on minerals collected by the government (in accordance with Article 47 of the Law \non Mineral Resources, after deductions for the Stabilization Fund established under the Fiscal Stability Law), \nplus an additional 20% of government mineral revenues over and above the level collected in the base year of \n2017;  \n(ii)  all dividends received attributable to state-owned shares of both state-owned and privately managed mining \ncompanies; and \n(iii)  50% of any revenue raised from new or incremental taxes on exploitation of mineral resources. \n \n ", "3 \nto limit the effects of risks associated with high-mineral dependency while balancing the needs of \ncurrent and future generations. \n \n6.  The  TA  will  help  the  government  (i)  institutionalize  effective  SWF  management \nmechanism based on transparent governance structure and proper accountability mechanisms, \n(ii) develop and implement the capacity development plans for required skill sets and human \nresources,  and  (iii)  produce  policy  recommendations  and  guidelines  for  establishing  and \nsupervising the FHF based on research and international good practices. \n  \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: sustainable long-term economic growth for \nfuture generation achieved. The TA will have the following outcome: SWF management institution \nestablished. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n8.  Output 1: Core documents and guidelines for establishing a SWF management \ninstitution produced and endorsed by MOF. The project team will prepare and publish a set of \ncore documents to achieve financial sustainability (business plan, investment mandate, and \nfinancial  mechanisms  and  criteria),  and  for  proper  governance  and  accountability  (internal \nregulations and guidelines). The documents will be based on the review of international good \npractices and related research. The project team will organize separate knowledge sessions for \nofficials of MOF and relevant agencies to disseminate the content of the core documents.  \n \n9.  Output 2: Comprehensive capacity development program for required skills and \nstaff prepared and training programs conducted. In addition to preparing a comprehensive \ncapacity development plan and conducting technical training workshops and seminars, the project \nteam will arrange and support domestic and external training opportunities, a study tour,10 and a \nstaff exchange program with SWF management institutions with good practices. \n \n10.  Output 3: A series of reports with policy recommendations and guidelines for \neffective management of the SWF management institution published. The project team will \npublish this series of reports as well as relevant market research and analysis. The findings will \nbe shared among policy makers, officials from relevant ministries, and staff members from SWF \nmanagement institutions in Mongolia through various knowledge-sharing activities. \n \n11.  Strategic fit. The TA will support the government to continue its reform efforts in public \nfinancial resource management by establishing a professional SWF management institution with \nproper governance and accountability mechanisms. The TA design follows ADB\u2019s Financial \nSector Operational Plan.11 The project is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2017\u2013\n2020 for Mongolia (footnote 2) and the Government Action Plan, 2016\u20132020.12 The project will \nsustain inclusive economic growth and improve the transparency and  accountability of the \nmanagement systems of the public sector to help ensure that the financial resources of both ADB \nand the government are used appropriately and effectively. \n \n                                                \n10 Study tours will be conducted in ADB member countries only. \n11 ADB. 2011.
