INTRODUCTION \n1.  Markets in Asia and the Pacific are expected to continue driving the world economy and \nto remain as the world\u2019s energy growth center. The region\u2019s energy consumption increased from \n13% of global consumption in 1971 to 30% in 2013 and is expected to increase to around 44% \nby 2035.1 The current trend is toward burning more fossil fuels to meet demand. However, \neconomies like the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC); India; Japan; the Republic of Korea; and \nTaipei,China  are  looking  at  ways  to  increase  natural  gas  consumption  to  displace  coal \nconsumption to improve air quality and, in the case of Japan and the Republic of Korea, to \ndisplace nuclear-based power generation. \n \n2.  The gas supply agreement between the PRC and Turkmenistan to export 55 billion cubic \nmeters (bcm) per annum of natural gas through Kazakhstan is a milestone achievement. Hence, \nregional cooperation and integration is an important tool for energy trade and is a strategic \nagenda and core area of operations of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) under its Strategy \n20202. In April 2014, the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 affirmed ADB\u2019s commitment to \nregional cooperation and integration with \u201cgreater attention to trade facilitation and capacity \nbuilding.\u201d3 This greater  attention  will  constitute  \u201cdedicated  support for trade facilitation  and \nharmonization of standards and practices to help boost competitiveness\u201d (footnote 2). As a \nresult of persistent market supply constraints, infrastructure bottlenecks, and trade inefficiencies, \nliquefied natural gas (LNG) prices in the region are two to four times higher than prices in \nEurope and the United States. The technical assistance (TA) will develop a framework for \nestablishing a competitive LNG market in Asia.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The Asian gas market comprises mature markets (Japan; the Republic of Korea; and \nTaipei,China),  energy  giants  still  developing  their  gas  markets  (the  PRC  and  India),  and \ndeveloping markets (Southeast Asian markets). The region\u2019s gas consumption is growing much \nfaster than the worldwide average, with developing member countries in the region increasingly \nreliant on imported LNG and projected to largely remain so for the foreseeable future. Future \nAsian natural gas demand depends heavily on the price of natural gas relative to coal and on \nthe development of sufficient regional conventional and unconventional supplies. Natural gas \nimports are more expensive than the wholesale prices in many Asian countries, which have a \nlong history of price subsidies (both for oil and natural gas). Moreover, Asian gas prices are not \nreflective of the regional supply\u2013demand fundamentals of natural gas, but are linked to long-\nterm supply contracts for crude oil.   \n \n \n4. Long-term Asian LNG prices were at record highs in 2012 and 2013, hovering around \n$20/million British thermal units (mmBtu) to $18/mmBtu. During January\u2013October 2014, the spot \nLNG prices were about $10.4/mmBtu; they have currently increased to $14.5/mmBtu due to \nincreased demand from Japan and the Republic of Korea. LNG is mostly supplied to Asian \nconsumers under long-term contracts. The recent slide in Brent prices to below $80 a barrel \ncould prompt some Asian buyers to call on additional long-term supplies where possible. LNG \nimports are becoming less affordable for some countries, and an insufficient gas supply could \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013.

Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 November 2014.  \n ", "2   \nseriously damage economic growth rates in a region where millions of people still lack access to \nmodern energy. \n \n5.  LNG  markets  responded  to  growing  demand  by  bringing  new  investment  forward, \nespecially in Australia, but recent experience has been plagued by project delays and cost \noverruns. Given its abundant shale gas production, North America emerged as a credible \npotential new supplier. However, the greenfield developments in Canada appear to have high \ncost. Regulatory approval processes and social acceptance of greenfield shale gas and oil \ndevelopment have delayed the envisaged flow of gas to Asian markets, which despite its low \nproduction cost will not going to be cheap in Asia due to the significant infrastructure needed. \nSimilarly, the long arduous approvals of export licenses in the United States (US) as well as the \nfundamental project development time lag have impacted gas flow to Asian markets. While \ndemand is rising in Asia, US gas will reach Asia markets only in early 2016 and in significant \nquantities only after 2025. Meanwhile, Canadian natural gas development will take time and is \nnot likely to reach Asian markets before 2020. Even in 2035, North American LNG is not \nprojected to exceed 10% of total gas supply in Asia. \n \n6.  The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that the US will become the third largest \nexporter of gas after Qatar and Australia. As North American LNG flows to Japan and the \nRepublic  of  Korea,  the  Japanese  and  Koreans  will  buy  less  LNG  from  Qatar  and  other \nconventional exporters, releasing LNG for other markets. LNG deliveries in 2013 amounted to \n240 million tons (100.8 million cubic meters [mcm]). Since 2012, LNG supply has been plagued \nby production shortfalls and supply shocks. The flat supply of gas and rising Asian demand \nhave resulted in continued tightening of the gas market, despite increased production from \nAlgeria,  Angola,  Australia,  Malaysia,  Qatar,  and  Yemen.  Algerian  production  was  low  and \nAngola had delays in plant start-up. Unplanned gas outages in Nigeria and continued production \ndecline  in  Egypt  weighed  on  gas  supply  and  kept  overall  gas  supplies  flat.  IEA  projects \nworldwide LNG trade will increase by 40% to 450 bcm by 2019. Driving this growth are markets \nin the PRC, Japan, India, the Republic of Korea, and Southeast Asian countries. US LNG \nexports will probably climb to about 2.41 bcm/day in 2020 or about 1.8% of global demand. \nWhile the US will not begin exporting gas until late 2015, the prospect of rising North American \nsupply is already having an impact as the market anticipates increased competition. Suppliers \nlike Qatar are looking to balance their portfolios and positioning themselves to be able to offer \nAsian buyers a much more flexible supply option from a pricing perspective.  \n \n7.  Ten  new  regasification  terminals  started  operations  in  2013,  while  four  new  LNG \nimporting markets emerged: Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, and Singapore. Viet Nam is building a \nregasification  terminal  to  meet  gas  demand  for  power  generation  and  the  petrochemical \nindustry. In 2013, imports to Asia increased, albeit at a slower rate than in recent years with a \nrise of 4.8 mcm. This tempering of growth was primarily due to Japan approaching a ceiling on \nboth volume of LNG imports it can physically accommodate and the capacity of its combined-\ncycle gas turbine power station. Japan\u2019s import of LNG in 2015 is difficult to estimate as some of \nthe nuclear plants are likely to come on line and this could free up some spare LNG capacity to \nother Asian markets like the PRC, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. \n \n8.  While North American LNG supplies are being developed, supplies from Papua New \nGuinea (2.9 mcm/annum) and Australia (where new LNG trains entered into construction to \nsupply 25.2 mcm/annum) could help meet the demand, but the timing of this new capacity will \nbe key to meeting the market supply over the next few years. The early supply of LNG from \nPapua New Guinea on the spot market lowered the spot market gas price in early 2014 but has \nrisen as new long-term contracts were negotiated. Additionally, gas has an important transition \n ", "  3 \nrole in developing countries as a lower emission fuel than other fossil fuels used for power \ngeneration. In this context, transparent, efficient, and well-functioning markets are an important \ntool to ensure that natural gas secures its place in the energy mix. \n \n9.  Without a transparent gas price that reflects regional supply and demand fundamentals, \ngas producers will have more difficulty signaling scarcity situations. This can result in a slower \nmarket response to (unexpected) gas shortages and therefore forms a security-of-supply risk. \nThis risk has given rise to recent discussions of the need for a regional LNG trading hub that \ncan facilitate the move of Asian gas importers away from oil-linked long-term contracts and \ntoward gas-to-gas pricing models. IEA examined this in 2012 and concluded that the transition \nfrom oil-indexed, long-term contracts to hub-based spot pricing is likely to be slow and gradual. \n \nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be a competitive, market-based LNG subsector fostered in \nAsia. The  outcome  will  be  increased  understanding  and  appreciation  by  target  developing \nmember countries of efficient functioning natural gas markets in Asia. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will have seven outputs. \n \n12.  Situation analysis of the current gas market in selected countries completed. The \ncurrent situation of different Asian countries will be analyzed in depth, to identify necessary \nsteps for the countries to liberalize their gas markets and create an enabling environment for a \nregional gas hub focusing on required regulatory, pricing, and governance structures. This will \ninvolve  an  examination  of  projected  supply  and  demand,  gas  market  regulation,  market \nstakeholders, existing and planned gas infrastructure developments, existing supply contracts, \nand subsidies. Given the relative market size of the PRC and India, the study will develop a \nseparate chapter dedicated to demand, pipeline facilities (bottlenecks), pricing, and regulatory \nreforms needed in their gas subsectors, as well as the prospects for gas displacing coal. \nIndonesia and Malaysia will also be treated as a separate case, as they are transforming from \nLNG exporters to LNG exporters and importers, and have access to pipeline infrastructure in the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations. Third-party access to this pipeline infrastructure will be \nexamined along with regulatory challenges to be addressed for the network to operate. The \nanalysis will include lessons from the experience and operation of trading hubs in North America \nand Europe, as well as how and in what ways political interference and economic cooperation \nhave affected, positively or not, the establishment and operation of these gas-trading hubs. \n  \n13.  Supply-side analysis completed. Existing long-term contracts of each country will be \nreviewed considering their flexibility, duration, pricing indexation, whether they are delivery ex-\nship or free on board, and how they compete against Henry Hub prices in different pricing \nscenarios. 5 Potential future suppliers to the region will be examined, and existing and future \nLNG export projects in each of these regions analyzed, including how they are contracted, their \nproposed timelines, and the relationship between potential suppliers and the various Asian \ncountries in terms of investment. The analysis will include an examination of how exogenous \n                                                \n5  The Henry Hub is a natural gas distribution hub in the United States and its name is used as the pricing point for \ngas futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange. \n ", "4   \nsupply-side developments (e.g., the potential for floating LNG technology to increase supply, \ndevelopment of shale gas resources, or LNG export policies of suppliers) may impact the \npotential for Asia to create a natural gas trading hub. Options will be examined for accessing \nstranded  gas  in  Indonesia.6 The  supply  and  demand-side  studies  will  assess  the  volume \nrequired to ensure the regional trading hub is competitive taking into consideration all variables \nof markets in the region, supply chains, and flows within and outside the region including \nexisting institutional arrangements (e.g., long-term supply contracts).  \n \n14.  Demand-side analysis completed. The existing demand and major markets for LNG in \nthe region will be examined, as well as potential and emerging markets. A model will be \ndeveloped to identify projects in the future, and demand by year and by country, considering all \nvariables, such as power and industrial requirements for gas in each country. \n \n15.  Shipping analyzed. Given that transport costs are a significant part of final LNG costs, \nshipping supply chain businesses will be interviewed to determine trends and changing market \ndynamics for LNG transport. The task includes examination of the outlook for LNG carrier day \nrates, the impact of shipping rates on LNG prices, adequacy of transport infrastructure and \nfuture requirements to support the Asian LNG market, and impacts such as the impact of \nPanama Canal expansion and changes to average shipping distance with the emergence of \nNorth America as a major LNG supplier to the region. \n \n16.  Local conditions analyzed. Development of LNG supply in the region must consider \nsmaller LNG cargo size requirements and the need to have anchor customers that can afford \nnew LNG supplies and support adequate LNG infrastructure. The analysis will include small-\nscale LNG for small power markets and the transport sector in Indonesia where coal-mining \ncompanies use dual fuel (diesel and gas) for large dump trucks and gas in gas engines for \npower  generation.  The  many  high  carbon  dioxide  gas  fields  and  stranded  gas  fields  in \nSoutheast Asia must also be assessed. Recommendations will be made on whether developing \nsmall-scale and floating LNG markets makes technical and economic sense, and what the \nimpact might be on the creation of an Asian market if such technology was developed. The \npotential of floating storage regasification unit technology in the region will be considered, as \nwell  as  trans-Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  gas  pipeline  infrastructure  as  an \nalternative to regional LNG trade.  \n \n17.  Environmental and security impacts assessed, including interactions between the \npower and gas subsectors. Pricing of natural gas and its resultant competitiveness with coal is \nessential to determine the projected gas demand from the power generation system, the largest \nsource of LNG demand across all countries under study. The assessment will address the \nquestion of how the creation of an Asian natural gas trading hub would affect gas prices and, \nconsequently, how lower prices might affect choices about energy generation and climate policy \ndesign. Of particular interest is the contribution that an efficiently functioning gas market can \nmake to the political economy of climate policy, by enabling diversification from new coal \ninvestments, increasing energy security, or increasing energy access without undue costs. It will \nalso analyze the potential substitution effects that reduced prices from gas trading might yield, \nand provide recommendations on how to enhance the role of natural gas in power generation, \nanalyzing its competitiveness against coal in different scenarios. \n \n18.  Structural  requirements  for  creating  a  trading  hub  identified.  International \nexperience of commodity market experts and practitioners will be utilized to determine how to \n                                                \n6  Stranded gas refers to natural gas reserves that are too small to be developed economically.  \n ", "  5 \noperationalize a spot market for natural gas trading in Asia. The key questions to be addressed \nare (i) what sort of liquidity, transparency, and diversification are necessary to allow the price \ndiscovery that is a necessary ingredient for an Asian natural gas spot market; (ii) what are the \ntechnical steps required to achieve that liquidity; and (iii) what kind of regulatory environment \nneeds to be put in place. Recommendations will be developed on how to proceed through the \ntechnical steps required to establish a trading hub, as well as examine the potential physical \nlocations for a hub. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.2 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  ADB will be the executing agency through the Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment. A team of international consultants, comprising IEA experts will be engaged to \nimplement the TA activities. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented from January 2015 to June 2016. Thirty-six person-months \nof international consulting services will be engaged through single-source selection.7 ADB will \ndirectly engage IEA, according to its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). Single-source selection is justified given the complex and specialized nature \nof the assignment and given IEA\u2019s substantial work on past issues and challenges faced by \nAsian  markets  through  its  various  studies,  including  Natural  Gas  in  India  (2010)8 and \nDeveloping a Natural Gas Trading Hub in Asia (2013).9 Importantly, IEA has neutrality with \nregard to gas market outcomes and the establishment of a regional gas hub, and the ability to \nengage market players objectively in regional forums. In this context, IEA is well respected by \ngovernments, and multilateral and bilateral agencies active in the energy sector.  \n \n22.  The TA will be administered by the Sustainable Infrastructure Division, with guidance \nfrom the Office of the Director General, Regional and Sustainable Development Department. \nThe TA will be regularly monitored through assessment of quality, alignment with proposed \noutcome, and timely delivery of outputs. Overall TA results will be disseminated through the \nrelease of outputs to national governments and through regional energy forums and the energy \ncommunity of practice. Knowledge products may be produced based on the study reports and \nthe TA completion report, which will document the implementation of the TA, lessons, and \neffective methodologies. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,200,000 on a grant basis \nfor Developing a Framework for a Liquefied Natural Gas Market in Asia, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n                                                \n7  The IEA contract amount will be limited to $930,000 with the Regional and Sustainable Development Department \nfacilitating the regional workshops. \n8  IEA. 2010.

Principal investigator (international, 4 person-months). The investigator will draw on \nsignificant senior energy and gas market experience in government, think tanks, and the private \nsector and work to maximize the policy impact of the study and its outputs. Specific tasks \ninclude \n(i)  assist in coordinating the full project team and coordinate with  the research \nteams, \n(ii)  serve as the primary point of contact for ADB, \n(iii)  set a delivery schedule for proposed outputs, \n(iv)  lead international workshops,  \n(v)  guide the structure and development of written products, and  \n(vi)  sign off on final outputs.  \n \n4.   Senior gas market analysts (up to five international experts, 18 person-months in total). \nThe senior gas market analysts form the core of the team and will support analysis of the \neconomic and geopolitical impacts of the changing Asian gas market, drawing upon experience \nin developing policy recommendations for countries to help implement the changes needed to \n ", "  Appendix 3  11 \nbuild a successful LNG hub. The experts should have (i) a degree in energy economics; (ii) a \nminimum  of  10  years\u2019  work  experience  in  energy  markets,  notably  global  gas  markets;  \n(iii) experience in leading projects involving multicultural teams; and (iv) experience in working \nwith government and energy companies as well as providing advice on key energy issues. \nMajor tasks include  \n(i)  analyze  and  understand  the  challenges  faced  by  gas  markets  in  different \ncountries,  including  by  conducting  interviews  and  reviews  of  the  countries \n(People\u2019s Republic of China [PRC], India, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of \nKorea, and Malaysia) included in the study; \n(ii)  analyze  the  economic  and  geopolitical  changes  that  would  stem  from  the \ncreation of an Asian LNG hub; \n(iii)  assess if the hub could be in the PRC or Japan instead of Singapore, as the \nvolume of LNG landed in Japan is 4.5 times the volume in Singapore; identify \nother measures that need to be in place when setting up an LNG hub; \n(iv)  given agreements signed for exports from the Russian Federation into the PRC, \nexamine if the gas volume imported via pipeline from the Myanmar, Russian \nFederation, and Turkmenistan, and the imported LNG are sufficient to meet the \nPRC\u2019s demand; if not, how much more is this demand expected to increase; \n(v)  as the PRC has ongoing shale gas exploration by Shell and Total through joint \nventures, will the application of new technology and drilling methods result in the \nPRC becoming a large shale gas producer by 2020, and if so, how is this likely to \nchange the regional gas markets in Asia and shale gas exports out of North \nAmerica; \n(vi)  build upon earlier work done in the PRC on gas pricing and regulation, and \nrecommend appropriate policies needed to support domestic gas exploration and \ndomestic market demand in the power subsector, combined-heat and power, \nindustrial demand, and domestic gas use for cooking; \n(vii)  analyze the gas market in the PRC, including barriers to PRC shale development \nthat  are  geologic,  technological,  and  institutional  in  nature;  the  potential  for \npricing structures and mineral rights reform to support domestic production; and \ninfrastructure (pipeline) constraints; \n(viii)  assess the implications of LNG exports from the United States (US) on Asian gas \nprices when US gas becomes available in 2016; determine the pricing that is \nbeing used in this context and what is needed in Asia to move away from gas \nprice linked to oil to purely gas\u2013gas price; \n(ix)  with  new  LNG  supplies  coming  into  the  market  from  Algeria,  Australia, \nMozambique, North America, and Papua New Guinea, assess how the price of \nLNG from Qatar will be affected, and if Qatar will be more amenable to lowering \nits price to secure markets;  \n(x)  assuming the Iran and United States are able to resolve their issues on nuclear, \nassess if the US will allow Iran to export gas and, if so, how will this affect the \nsupply and demand situation in the region; \n(xi)  examine the use of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) gas \npipeline  for  export  through  pipeline  to,  for  example,  Singapore  via  the  gas \npipeline network from  Myanmar or Viet Nam;  \n(xii)  identify the challenges to having third-party access to this gas pipeline network in \nASEAN and what kinds of policy and legal regulations are needed to enable such \ncross-border gas flows; draw upon European experience and determine if this \ncan be adopted after modification to suit ASEAN needs; \n(xiii)  identify the impediments in Indonesia for allowing third party access in its gas \npipelines and recommend appropriate changes in policy or regulation that could \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \nbe  implemented  by  Indonesia  so  that  more  domestic  gas  could  be  used \ndomestically instead of exported; \n(xiv)  identify  policy,  regulations,  and  incentives  needed  to  bring  stranded  gas  to \nmarket in Indonesia; assess if this gas can be used in some areas of Kalimantan \nand Sumatra to meet localized loads; identify financial and technical resources \nneeded to bring this gas for consumption; \n(xv)  identify the role of floating LNG and floating regasification and storage units in \nASEAN,  and  their  cost  advantage  over  land-based  LNG  terminals;  provide \nexamples of how these can be used or are already being used;  \n(xvi)  identify  the  challenges  in  India  and  what  is  preventing  the  construction  of \npipelines and LNG terminals on the eastern side of the country; \n(xvii)  assess how gas pricing and regulation is addressed in India, and if this can be \nimproved and, if so, make salient recommendations; \n(xviii)  examine specifics of LNG markets in Asia, in terms of sourcing (analysis of long-\nterm LNG contracts), key terms in long-term LNG contracts, and LNG shipping; \nexamine the flexibility of moving shipments from one intended country to another \nduring shipment; \n(xix)  provide  guidance  to  other  team  members  and  participants  on  each  of  the \ndifferent steps of the study;
