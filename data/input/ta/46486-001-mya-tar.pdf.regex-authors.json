INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar requested the assistance of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) to assist the Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP) in updating \nthe Myanmar Electricity Law (1984) and the Electricity Rules (1985) so that they reflect current \ninternational standards and create an enabling framework for introducing an electricity regulator \nand  corresponding  institutional  arrangements.  The  revision  and  implementation  of  a  new \nelectricity law and electricity regulations will support the government\u2019s reform agenda for the \npower  sector  by  (i)  providing  an  improved  regulatory  framework  for  gradual  future  sector \nunbundling  (generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  subsectors);  (ii)  encouraging  greater \nprivate sector participation in generation projects and enabling third-party network access; (iii) \nestablishing rules and regulations for small independent power producers to promote off-grid \nelectrification; (iv) implementing rural electrification programs; and (v) introducing an electricity \nregulator consistent with internationally recognized good practices. The government concurs \nwith the impact, outcome, outputs, and key activities as presented in the design and monitoring \nframework in Appendix 1.1 \n \n2.  Responding to the government\u2019s ongoing major reforms toward a democratic system \nand market-based economy, ADB adopted in early 2012 a phased approach to re-engagement \nwith Myanmar, involving significant preparatory analytical work and country dialogue in the first \nhalf of 2012. ADB has prepared an initial energy sector assessment that calls for promoting \nenergy efficiency and developing a pricing mechanism for electricity as part of the overall public \nsector reform program.2 The technical assistance (TA) is aligned with ADB\u2019s interim country \npartnership strategy, 2012\u20132014, with the objective of re-engaging in the country and improving \naccess to reliable and sustainable utility services.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Myanmar\u2019s energy policy framework centers on (i) maintaining energy independence, (ii) \npromoting wider use of new and renewable energy sources, (iii) promoting energy efficiency and \nconservation, and (iv) promoting the use of alternative fuels in households. Seven ministries are \nresponsible for energy matters. The two main energy-related line ministries are the Ministry of \nEnergy (overall energy policy and the oil and gas sector) and the MOEP (hydropower, coal-fired \npower  generation,  gas-fired  power  generation,  mini-hydro,  and  power  transmission  and \ndistribution).4 The government established the National Energy Management Committee and \nthe Energy Development Committee in January 2013 to strengthen coordination among the \nseven ministries with a view to improving resource planning for and oversight of investment in \nenergy sector development.5 \n \n4.  The power sector in Myanmar is governed by the Electricity Act 1948 (as amended in \n1967), the Myanmar Electricity Law (1984), and the Electricity Rules (1985). This legislation \n                                                \n1  The technical assistance (TA) first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 January \n2013. \n2  ADB. 2012. Myanmar: Energy Sector Initial Assessment. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2012. Interim Country Partnership Strategy: Myanmar, 2012\u20132014. Manila. \n4  The other five ministries with responsibilities for energy matters are the Ministry of Mines (coal mines); the Ministry \nof  Agriculture  and  Irrigation  (biofuels,  micro-hydro  for  irrigation);  the  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology \n(renewable energy); the Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry (fuelwood, climate change, and \nenvironmental safeguards requirements); and the Ministry of Industry (energy efficiency). \n5  In April 2013, ADB provided technical assistance to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for Institutional \nStrengthening of National Energy Management Committee in Energy Policy and Planning in the amount of \n$1,350.000 (TA 8356-MYA). \n ", "2   \nneeds revision to reflect current international best practices in power sector governance. There \nis also a pressing need to develop grid codes and model power purchase agreements for small \nand large power generation projects. These rules and draft models do not exist in Myanmar and \nwill have to be based on current international best practices with appropriate guidelines and \nrequirements  to  allow  private  independent  power  producers  to  connect  with  the  Myanmar \nnational grid. \n \n5.  The power sector in Myanmar is currently under the responsibility of MOEP, which, as \nwell as being responsible for power sector policy, includes (i) development, implementation, and \noperation and maintenance (O&M) of all large hydropower plants and coal-fired thermal power \nplants;  (ii)  construction  and  O&M  of  transmission  and  distribution  systems  throughout  the \ncountry;  (iii) O&M  of  gas-fired  thermal  power  generation  plants;  and  (iv)  planning, \nimplementation, and O&M of mini-hydropower plants.6   \n \n6.  The MOEP consists of seven departments: the Department of Hydropower Planning, the \nDepartment  of  Hydropower  Implementation,  the  Hydropower  Generation  Enterprise,  the \nDepartment  of  Electric  Power,  the  Myanmar  Electric  Power  Enterprise,  the  Yangon  City \nElectricity Supply Board, and the Electric Supply Enterprise. The Department of Hydropower \nPlanning plans hydropower projects for implementation by local provincial enterprises, by joint \nventures with foreign investors, or by the department itself. The Department of Hydropower \nImplementation has four institutes responsible for design, investigation works, and mechanical \nworks; and seven engineering construction companies capable of constructing and installing \nlarge hydropower projects. The Hydropower Generation Enterprise operates and maintains all \nof  the  MOEP\u2019s  hydropower  stations  and  participates  in  O&M  of  power  plants  under  joint \nventures. Despite its name, the Hydropower Generation Enterprise also operates the country\u2019s \nonly coal-fired power plant, which has a nominal capacity of 120 megawatts. \n \n7.  The  main  function  of  the  Department  of  Electric  Power  is  power  system  strategic \nplanning.  The  Myanmar  Electric  Power  Enterprise  is  responsible  for  the  development, \nconstruction, and O&M of transmission networks; and O&M of gas-fired power plants, including \ngas turbines and combined-cycle gas turbines. The transmission network covers the existing 66 \nkilovolt (kV), 132 kV, and 230 kV voltage levels; and the planned 500 kV system (currently being \nconstructed). The distribution systems consist of lower voltages of 33 kV, 11 kV, 6.6 kV, and \n0.4 kV. Two distribution enterprises\u2014the Yangon City Electricity Supply Board and the Electric \nSupply Enterprise\u2014operate the distribution systems. The Yangon City Electricity Supply Board \nis responsible for electricity supply to consumers in Yangon City. The Electric Supply Enterprise \ncovers the rest of the country, comprising 17 states and divisions, including off-grid generation \nand distribution; it is also responsible for planning, implementing, and operating off-grid mini-\nhydropower  and  diesel  stations.  The  Yangon  Electricity  Supply  Board  and  Electric  Supply \nEnterprise also implement system improvement and expansion of distribution systems.  \n \n8.  The MOEP is responsible for policy and oversight as well as regulation of the power \nsector; and is vested with all planning, operating, and management responsibilities for the \nsector. In the absence of a distinct regulatory framework to support the functional unbundling \nthat will need to take place soon, the MOEP will need clear directions on how this could be \nachieved through a revised electricity law. The MOEP has a draft concept note on power sector \npolicy that outlines a reform strategy to (i) rationalize power sector institutions and functions, (ii) \ngradually  commercialize  the  institutions,  (iii)  develop  a  regulatory  framework  through  an \nelectricity law, (iv) gradually adopt cost-based tariffs, (v) promote private sector participation, (vi) \n                                                \n6  The MOEP No. 1 and the MOEP No. 2 were merged as the MOEP in September 2012. \n ", "  3 \nincrease rural access to electricity, (vii) undertake demand-side management, and (viii) update \nthe law and regulations on health and safety and sector-related offences. Policy has tended to \nbe developed through the process of drafting the new law, rather than through wide consultation \nwith concerned ministries and stakeholders whose inputs are then captured in law.   \n \n9.  The government recognizes that foreign direct investment will be required to achieve \nprojected  investments  in  the  power  sector.  A  framework  to  attract  build\u2013operate\u2013transfer \ninvestments  will  need  to  be  adopted.  Notable  features  of  such  a  framework  include \nguaranteeing the convertibility of local currency into foreign currency, permitting the mortgaging \nof project assets, specifying tax levels, and allowing risk sharing by the government and private \ninvestors.  However,  various  shortcomings  continue  to  impede  rapid  development  of  build-\noperate\u2013transfer projects in the power sector, principally the (i) lack of a comprehensive and \ntransparent regulatory framework, (ii) need to modernize the legal and financial system and \nlegislation, (iii) lack of a modern law governing private sector investment, and (iv) lack of \nexperience in and capability to facilitate long-term foreign investment in infrastructure. The \ngovernment recognizes the importance of these issues and is taking the first steps to strengthen \npower sector legislation by introducing an updated electricity law. \n \n10.  A draft electricity law has been prepared by a working committee under the supervision \nof the Minister of the MOEP to provide a broad framework for the development and regulation of \nthe power sector. This committee is composed exclusively of MOEP staff. At the MOEP\u2019s \nrequest, ADB provided assistance to engage a short-term legal expert to assist the MOEP in \ndeveloping the draft. The draft has been submitted to the Office of the Attorney General for \ncomments. This will be followed by interministerial consultations, after which the draft will be \napproved by the cabinet and submitted to Parliament. The current draft law is quite general. It \nidentifies the institutions and reforms that will be required, and outlines principles and concepts \nfor allocating tasks among agencies. It creates a framework for licensing and contracting for \nnew projects, and establishes an electricity regulatory authority (ERA) to regulate tariffs and \ninvestment programs and oversee the introduction of technical codes and standards. Initially, \nthe ERA will be a division or department within the MOEP. \n \n11.  The electricity law is expected to serve as the foundation for the regulatory framework. \nAt  the  same  time,  its  usefulness  will  be  limited  until  it  is  operationalized  by  drawing  up \nsupporting secondary legislation and setting up the ERA as envisaged under the law. The ERA \nis expected to play a central role in the strategic development of the power sector (least-cost \nsystem expansion; investment planning and financing; fuel and electricity pricing; retailing of \nelectricity in rural areas; and cross subsidization among others) and overseeing implementation \nof the strategy with its regulatory powers. The government sought ADB\u2019s assistance in drafting \nand  operationalizing  the  proposed  electricity  law,  including  initial  capacity  building  on  the \nprinciples of electricity regulation. \n \n12.  To increase the rural electrification ratio and the supply of electricity to rural areas, the \nMOEP  also  requested  ADB\u2019s  assistance  in  preparing  a  new  rural  electrification  law  and \nimplementing regulations to streamline the role and function of the ministries, including the state \ngovernment, and to prioritize the necessary investment and government budget allocation.7 \n \n                                                \n7  The country\u2019s average electrification grew from about 16% in 2006 to 26% in 2011. Yangon City has the highest \nelectrification ratio (67%), followed by Nay Pyi Taw (54%), Kayar (37%), and Mandalay (31%). The remaining rural \nareas are still poorly electrified, averaging about 16%. \n ", "4   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the TA will be power sector reforms initiated. The outcome will be the legal \nand institutional framework accepted by the government. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will have the following outputs: (i) the draft legal and regulatory framework and \ninstitutional arrangements of the power sector are developed; and (ii) institutional arrangements \nfor the establishment of the ERA are finalized. The TA will be carried out in three phases. Phase \n1 will include (i) continuous support to the MOEP during the consultation process until the \npromulgation  of  the  draft  electricity  law;  and  (ii)  a  review  of  the  new  electricity  law  after \npromulgation and the identification of remaining issues to be included in future revisions of the \nlaw, including related regulatory reform models and a proposed rural electrification law. Phase 2 \nwill include (i) drafting of implementing regulations under the revised electricity law and the \nproposed rural electrification law; (ii) developing a competitive power market as a long-range \ngoal; and (iii) defining the institutional arrangements for establishing the ERA, including its \nlocation, organization structure, and staffing. Phase 3 will include drafting of implementing rules \nand regulations necessary for operating the ERA.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000 equivalent, of which $850,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by the Government of Norway, and administered by ADB. The Government of \nMyanmar will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, reports \nand  documents,  secretarial  assistance,  local  communication  facilities,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.   The MOEP will be the executing agency. The TA will establish a steering committee \ncomposed of representatives from (i) the generation, transmission, and distribution departments \nof the MOEP; (ii) the Department of Electric Power and the Department of Hydropower Planning, \nboth of the MOEP; (iii) the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development; and (iv) \nthe Office of the Attorney General. The MOEP will assign its director general as head of the \nsteering committee, reporting directly to the Minister of the MOEP. Monitoring will be through \nregular reporting by the consultants, and comments and suggestions from key stakeholders. A \nseries of workshops may be held to discuss progress with institutions, including the MOEP, and \nto disseminate the TA findings.  \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented from October 2013 to December 2014. About 40 person-\nmonths of consulting services (13 person-months of international consulting services and 27 \nperson-months of national consulting services) will be engaged through a firm using quality- and \ncost-based  selection  (quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20).  Consultant  engagement  will  be  done  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). The international regulatory expert will act as team leader. The international consultants \nwill be responsible to ADB for the total scope of work. In carrying out their work, the consultants \nwill coordinate with the Japan International Cooperation Agency Resident Office in Yangon from \ntime  to  time  to  ensure  that  the  agency\u2019s  work  on  the  power  development  master  plan \n ", "  5 \ncomplements the proposed electricity law, and with the World Bank on the development of a \nMyanmar national electrification program. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 3. \n \n18.  Equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as \namended from time to time). On completion of the TA, all equipment will be turned over to the \nexecuting  agency.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n19.  Several civil society consultations will be held during the revision of the electricity law, \nthe  drafting  of  the  new  rural  electrification  law  and  its  implementing  regulations.  The \nconsultations will be followed by discussions and workshops. The draft laws will be disclosed to \nthe public through electronic media in both the English and Burmese language, as well as \nthrough other means appropriate to reaching other interested stakeholders. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $850,000 to the Government \nof Myanmar to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Norway for Enhancing the \nPower Sector\u2019s Legal and Regulatory Framework, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact  By 2018:    Assumption \nPower sector reforms  Revised electricity law  Government publications  Government reform \ninitiated  enacted  agenda is maintained \nand sustained. \nRegulator (ERA)  ADB country dialogue \n \nestablished   and consultations \nRisk \n    Policy adoption is weak. \nOutcome  By end 2016:    Assumption \nLegal and institutional  Revised electricity law and  Government and  Recommended actions \nframework accepted  implementing regulations  steering committee  are accepted and \nby the government  accepted by Parliament   reports  endorsed by the \n    government and other \nDraft rural electrification  TA completion report  stakeholders. \nlaw and implementing     \nregulations acceptable to  Feedback from donors \nRisk \nthe government and ADB  and stakeholders \n  There is insufficient \nInstitutional requirements  support for the TA \nfor establishing the ERA  recommendations by \naccepted by the  members of Parliament. \ngovernment \n \nOutputs  By end 2014    Assumptions \n1.
