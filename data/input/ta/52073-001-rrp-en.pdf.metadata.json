THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased grant to Nauru for the Improving Public Investment Management Program. \n \n2.  The proposed program aims to strengthen Nauru\u2019s public investment management and \nfiscal sustainability, which are critical for effective service delivery and inclusive growth. It is part \nof long-standing assistance provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 The program builds \non progress under previous policy-based programs and technical assistance (TA) to improve the \nmanagement of public expenditure and assets, and the governance of state-owned enterprises \n(SOEs).2 It is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 priority of strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity, particularly in small island developing states.3 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Economic development challenges. Nauru is a Pacific microstate. Its population of \nabout 13,000 is concentrated along the narrow coastal belt of its single 21-square kilometer \nisland. Small size and remoteness raise the cost of providing public infrastructure and services \nwhile limiting competitiveness and economies of scale. The government and SOEs dominate \neconomic activity and employment, with SOEs alone creating about half of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) and one third of formal sector jobs. Nauru reported double-digit economic growth \nfrom 2010 to 2014, but this has slowed since with (i) a scaling down of the operations of the \nAustralian-funded  Regional  Processing  Centre  (RPC)  for  asylum  seekers;  and  (ii)  falling \nphosphate exports, as the primary deposits of the island\u2019s main resource near depletion. The \nscope for economic diversification, private investment, and job creation is limited; and the levels \nof social vulnerability, inequality, and noncommunicable disease are high.4 Women held only \n10.5% of seats in the national parliament in 2019. \n \n4.  COVID-19  impacts.  Nauru\u2019s  economy  is  affected  by  trade  and  travel  disruptions \nstemming from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.5 Construction of infrastructure \nprojects, which rely on imports and foreign workers, will slow. This will have follow-on impacts to \n \n1  ADB. 2017. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020. Manila; ADB. 2016.

Nauru had no reported cases of COVID-19 as at 22 April 2020.  ", "2 \nservices, Nauru\u2019s biggest sector, which are doubly affected by reduced activity associated with \nthe RPC. Economic contraction of 1.7% is projected by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in \nFY2020 followed by a recovery in FY2021 (Table 1). A slowdown in government revenue and an \nincrease in spending is expected to erode the fiscal balance in FY2020. The government\u2019s initial \nfiscal response to COVID-19 has included reprioritizing public expenditure towards health and \ncontainment  efforts  and  providing  liquidity  support to  SOEs to  ensure  critical  services  are \nmaintained. Improved public expenditure management and governance of SOEs would help the \ngovernment to confront rising fiscal risks related with COVID-19.    \n \nTable 1: Macro-Fiscal Performance and Outlook, FY2016\u2013FY2021 \n(% of GDP unless otherwise indicated) \nItem  FY2016  FY2017  FY2018   FY2019   FY2020   FY2021  \ne e p p\nGrowth and Inflation             \nReal GDP growth (% \n3.0  (5.5)  5.7  1.0  (1.7)  1.3 \nchange) \nConsumer prices (% \n8.2  5.1  0.5  3.9  1.5   1.7 \nchange) \nGovernment Finance             \nTotal revenue and grants  114.9  121.8  129.3  141.6  141.1  106.4 \nRevenue  91.6  100.6  108.5  126.6  120.7  90.6 \nGrants  23.3  21.3  20.8  15.1  20.4  15.8 \nTotal expenditure  93.4  100.5  96.8  125.6  141.1  102.1 \nOverall balance  21.4  21.4  32.5  16.1  0.0  4.3 \n \n    Including government \n6.6  13.2  23.2  7.3  (10.3)  (6.9) \nNTF contributions \n \nNTF             \nNTF stock  24.6  39.1  52.8  63.6  77.5  89.7 \nDebt             \nDomestic debt  45.5  43.1  43.7  33.5  31.3  29.8 \nExternal debt  34.0  33.6  30.6  28.7  29.5  29.2 \n( ) = negative, e = estimate, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International Monetary Fund, \nNTF = Nauru Intergenerational Trust Fund, p = projection. \nSources: ADB estimates; Government of Nauru Budget Documents; International Monetary Fund.   \n \n5.  Fiscal performance. Government domestic revenue increased fivefold from FY2012 to \nFY2019 because of the reopening of the RPC, improved fishing license receipts under a regional \narrangement, and increased tax collection.6 The government has used recent fiscal surpluses to \nadd to the Nauru Intergenerational Trust Fund (NTF) and reduce arrears. Fiscal surpluses have \nalso enabled the government to build its cash buffer, resulting in government deposits equivalent \nto more than 2 months of non-RPC spending since August 2017, as recommended by the IMF.7 \nLimited access to credit markets and a vulnerability to economic shocks make it critical for Nauru \nto maintain adequate cash buffers (in addition to the NTF) to protect budget stability. If, as \nexpected, RPC activity and the revenue this generates for the government decline over the \nmedium-term, the IMF projects that fiscal spending would have to adjust to maintain sufficient \ncash buffers and contributions to the NTF.8 To maintain budget stability and to help put public \ndebt on a sustainable path, the government needs to improve the management of its public \n \ninvestments. \n \n6  In  nominal  terms.

Washington, DC ", "3 \n \n6.  Public sector debt and state-owned enterprises. The IMF reports that total public \nsector  debt,  including  SOE  debt,  equaled  86.8%  of  GDP  in  FY2018  and  is  considered \nunsustainable. This is higher than the level reported in the 2017 Article IV staff report because of \nthe inclusion of some existing SOE debt and legacy debt pending resolution, and a new loan for \nphosphate mining. In addition, weak governance and monitoring have prevented Nauru\u2019s SOEs \nfrom operating on strict commercial principles. Unfinanced directives to deliver community service \nobligations distort SOE financial performance incentives.9 SOE subsidies and equity injections \ntotaled about 13.4% of Nauru\u2019s public expenditure during the two years FY2019\u2013FY2020, yet few \nSOEs  keep  up-to-date  financial  information.  The  absence  of  a  central  unit  to  monitor  the \nperformance of the SOE portfolio limited the government\u2019s ability to ensure that they are run \nefficiently and in the best interest of the people of Nauru. Lacking a precise mandate, some SOEs \ncompete with private companies, making it difficult for the private sector to grow in Nauru\u2019s small \nmarket. The IMF has indicated that delays in implementing SOE reforms would lower growth \nprospects and jeopardize fiscal sustainability (footnote 8). The program will help address the risks \nposed by SOE debt by establishing directors\u2019 obligations relating to public enterprise debt under \nthe Public Enterprise Act, 2019; and creating a public enterprise monitoring unit with responsibility \nto advise the government on public enterprise loans and contingent liabilities, among other SOE \nissues. A measure to improve public debt reporting by the Department of Finance (DOF) is also \nincluded in the post-program partnership framework (PPPF). \n \n7.  Public expenditure management weaknesses. While a solid legislative framework \nexisted in the Public Finance Act, 1997, the absence of adequate financial instructions meant that \nthe responsibilities of delegated officers were unclear and fragmented. Unutilized modules of the \ngovernment\u2019s financial management information system (FMIS) further undermined expenditure \nmanagement.  The  public  could  not  easily  access  budget  documents,  which  limited  the \ntransparency of public expenditure and debt. Combined with the effects of Nauru\u2019s geographic \nisolation, continued weaknesses in public procurement often resulted in high unit costs for, and \nsupply shortages of, publicly procured goods. \n \n8.  Public asset management weaknesses. Efficient management of assets has been a \ngrowing  challenge  for  the  government,  given  significant  infrastructure  investments  by \ndevelopment partners and those made in connection with the RPC since 2012, as well as aging \ninfrastructure assets in other sectors. Government departments generally lacked data on the \ncondition and maintenance requirements of their assets to inform sound budget planning. This, \ncombined with low institutional capacity for asset management, contributed to weak budget \nplanning and maintenance spending. To build a sustainable future, Nauru needs to manage its \npublic investments more effectively to ensure better value for money and better delivery of public \nservices. \n \n9.  Past ADB engagement. ADB has addressed Nauru\u2019s development financing needs and \ncreated incentives for reform through two policy-based programs, which were supported by TA to \nbuild  government  capacity  to  meet  agreed  policy  actions.10  The  2012  Public  Financial \nManagement  Reform  Program,  ADB\u2019s  first  policy-based  program  in  the  country,  provided \n \n9  ADB.

Lessons. ADB\u2019s previous policy-based grants have financed stand-alone operations that \nsequenced reforms to build on past achievements. Ongoing support in these reform areas was \nprovided through TA. The program completion reports recommended that ADB\u2019s focus on public \nfinancial management, asset management, the NTF, and SOE performance should continue in \nfuture operations (footnote 14). The program will do so while addressing the risks posed by SOE \ndebt\u2014a remaining weakness (para. 6). While previous policy-based programs have supported \nthe adoption of a debt management strategy and corporate governance reforms at select SOEs, \nthe program will establish clear responsibilities relating to debt across the SOE portfolio by \nestablishing an overarching legal and monitoring framework. The program will also incorporate \nlessons during the first two policy-based programs by recognizing that (i) policy-based programs \ncan achieve results when country ownership is strong, (ii) strong technical analysis can help \nensure that a government will continue to view policy actions as appropriate even after the political \nand economic context changes, (iii) coordinated development partner TA support can help the \ngovernment follow through on policy actions when local institutional capacity is low, and (iv) a \ntight focus on a limited set of policy actions can help ensure that reforms are delivered within the \nenvisaged time frame. \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n11.  Government strategy. Nauru\u2019s development vision, adopted in 2005, is \u201ca future where \nindividual, community, business, and government partnerships contribute to a sustainable quality \nof life for all Nauruans.\u201d15 The Nauru Sustainable Development Strategy 2019-2030 translates \nthis vision into seven development goals, two of which are relevant for the program: (i) the \ndevelopment of stable, trustworthy, fiscally responsible government; and (ii) the provision of \nenhanced  social,  infrastructure,  and  utility  services.

The need to \nmaintain economic stability, enhance public infrastructure, and rationalize SOEs to encourage \ngreater private sector investment and economic diversification is also recognized. \n \n12.  Program description. ADB proposes a stand-alone policy-based program that improves \nthe policy and institutional environment to enable higher returns to Nauru\u2019s public investment. \nWhile the program supports critical reforms needed to address Nauru\u2019s development constraints, \npolicy dialogue has shown that several follow-up steps will be crucial when the program ends. \nThe government and ADB have agreed on a PPPF, which will ensure that recently approved \npolicy decisions and legislative changes are fully implemented, and that support will be there for \nthe next phase of associated reforms.16 A follow-on program is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan, but discussions are ongoing to determine which modality will be most appropriate \nto support the next phase of reforms.17 ADB is also considering support through its COVID-19 \nPandemic Response Option to help counter the macroeconomic and health impacts of COVID-\n19 in Nauru. The stand-alone modality is considered appropriate for the current program because \nof (i) the success of the ADB\u2019s Public Financial Management Reform Program and Fiscal \nSustainability Reform Program, which also employed this modality; (ii) lessons from prior ADB-\nfinanced programs to avoid complexity and ensure a tight focus on a limited set of policy actions; \n(iii) the need to leverage support for reform in a targeted manner in fragile and conflict-affected \nenvironments; and (iv) the current uncertainties regarding the most appropriate modality to \nsupport the next phase of Nauru\u2019s reforms. \n \n13.  Program alignment. ADB and the government agreed to focus reform efforts under the \nprogram in three areas critical to addressing Nauru\u2019s development challenges and objective of a \nsustainable quality of life: (i) public expenditure management, (ii) public asset management, and \n(iii) the governance of SOEs. The eight prior actions to be accomplished before program grant \neffectiveness are outlined below and set out in the policy matrix (Appendix 4). The program is \naligned with IMF policy advice (footnote 8); ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach for 2016\u20132020, including its \nthree-pronged strategy to reduce costs, manage risks, and enable value creation;18 and three \noperational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 to address poverty and inequality (through better \nmanagement of the public investments needed for equitable delivery of public services), to \naccelerate  progress  in  gender  equality  (by  incorporating  gender  provisions  in  public  asset \nmanagement and the governance of SOEs), and to strengthen governance and institutional \ncapacity. The program is also in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 requirement for a differentiated \napproach by ADB to focus on institutional strengthening in fragile and conflict-affected situations \nand to help small island developing states manage financial and economic risks, and reform SOEs \n(footnote 3). \n \n14.  Reform area 1: Public expenditure management improved. Policy actions under this \nreform area focus on strengthening budget control, reporting, and transparency; saving windfall \nrevenue  in  the  NTF  to  finance  future  development  needs;  and  assessing  the  remaining \nweaknesses in public procurement. These actions will help Nauru sustain a responsible fiscal \nposition, promote the strategic allocation of resources, and provide confidence to development \npartners to continue their ongoing support: \n \n \n16  The PPPF has been used successfully in other Pacific developing member countries, providing a platform for \nongoing policy dialogue in years when ADB does not provide policy financing and guiding the focus of any \nsubsequent program.

As a prior action, the secretary of \nfinance issued new financial instructions on general principles, payments, and \nbudget in October 2018, which outline the responsibilities of delegated officers to \nensure that financial transactions are properly managed, controlled, recorded, and \nreported, consistent with Nauru\u2019s legislative framework for public finances; the \ngeneral ledger and accounts receivable functions of the FMIS were made fully \nfunctional; and audited financial statements for FY2015 and FY2016, the annual \nand quarterly budget documents for FY2018 and FY2019, and the quarterly budget \nperformance reports for FY2019 were published on the government website. \nProviding the public with easy access to information on government revenues, \nexpenditure,  and  debt  is  a  critical  step  in  building  public  accountability  and \ntransparency. \n(ii)  Nauru  Intergenerational  Trust  Fund.  ADB\u2019s  Fiscal  Sustainability  Reform \nProgram  and  TA  supported  the  establishment  of  the  NTF  in  FY2016  as  a \nmechanism  for  saving  windfall  revenue  and  funding  future  service  delivery \n(para. 9).19 Government contributions are guided by a set of targeted contribution \nranges that specify the percentage of domestic revenue to be deposited by the \ngovernment each year, with the rate rising progressively.20 As a prior action and in \nline with its targeted contribution, the government maintained its commitment \ntoward the NTF by depositing an amount equivalent to 10.1% of FY2018 revenue \n(excluding  pass-through  RPC-related  revenue)  in  the  NTF  for  FY2019.21  In \naddition, the government used windfall revenue in FY2019 to make an early \ndeposit of $1.4 million toward the following FY2020 targeted contribution.  \n(iii)  Public procurement. While Nauru had outsourced major government and SOE \nprocurement, weaknesses remained that reduced the quality and value for money \nof  Nauru\u2019s  public  services.22  To  address  the  remaining  deficiencies,  the \ngovernment requested a review of public sector and SOE procurement practices, \nfor which ADB provided TA support. As a prior action, in June 2019, the cabinet \nconsidered the outcome of this review and approved its proposed reform options \nto strengthen public procurement. The government has since amended the Public \nFinance  Act  to  enable  SOEs  to  be  engaged  in  procurement.  Improving \nprocurement planning will be a critical next step and is included in the PPPF. \n \n15.  Reform area 2: Public asset management improved. Policy actions under this reform \narea aim to improve the balance between the government\u2019s capital investments in infrastructure \nand its spending to maintain them. The cabinet approved an infrastructure asset management \npolicy in 2017. To provide a framework for affordable asset management, the policy called for the \ndevelopment of an integrated infrastructure asset management plan, which has been supported \nunder this program. \n \n(i)  Asset register. As a prior action, the government established a central asset \nregister to reflect the assets\u2019 condition, location, and financial information\u2014data \nthat  was  generally  not  available  previously,  except  for  the  Nauru  Utilities \nCorporation. The register, which has been operational since June 2019, covers \n \n19  ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for Pacific Economic Management (Phase 2). Manila. \n20  After the build-up phase, which is prospectively set to FY2033, the NTF will enter a distribution phase. The NTF \ncommittee will determine when the distribution phase is to begin based on the ability of the NTF to provide a material \namount of budget financing in perpetuity.  \n21  This was equivalent to $10.4 million. \n22  The government\u2019s procurement policy required the outsourcing of government and SOE procurement greater than \n$3,521 (A$5,000 equivalent, excluding bulk fuel procurement) to an independent procurement agent.   ", "7 \ngovernment assets (including buildings, roads, water and sanitation systems, \ncoastal protection, and vehicles) with a replacement cost of $25,000 or more.23 \n(ii)  Integrated infrastructure strategic plan. As a prior action, the cabinet approved \nthe adoption and implementation of the Nauru Integrated Infrastructure Strategic \nPlan in November 2019. This plan uses information from the asset register and \napplies economic and social criteria, including a gender-specific provision relating \nto the employment prospects an investment would generate for women, and a \nclimate change and disaster risk vulnerability provision, to provide a framework to \nidentify and prioritize rehabilitation works, upgrades, and new capital investments \nfor the next 5 years from 2019.24 It also estimates the annual maintenance budget \nrequired to maintain both current assets and priority infrastructure projects.  \n \n16.  Reform area 3: Governance of state-owned enterprises enhanced. The intent of the \nprogram\u2019s SOE governance policy actions is to overhaul the current policy and legislative \nframework and introduce centralized monitoring of SOE performance across all sectors. \n \n(i)  State-owned  enterprise  policy.  As  a  prior  action,  the  cabinet  approved  a \ncommercially oriented SOE policy in November 2018. The policy outlines the \nrationale for government ownership of SOEs and establishes principles to guide \nSOE reforms.  \n(ii)  Public enterprise bill. As a prior action, in June 2019, the cabinet approved a \npublic enterprise bill for submission to Parliament, based on the new SOE policy. \nThis bill, which was subsequently enacted by Parliament, creates the legislative \nframework for SOEs to be commercially successful, while establishing reporting \nand transparency requirements to the government as the owner of the SOEs. \nUnder the bill, responsible ministers must present to Parliament the annual reports \nof public enterprises (which include audited financial statements), while directors \nof public enterprises must take steps to avoid insolvency and could be liable if they \nfail to take reasonable steps to ensure the public enterprise does not incur a debt \nit cannot repay. The bill establishes processes to make SOE delivery of community \nservice obligations financially sustainable; and it directs SOEs to promote gender \nequality through their employment practices, policies, and board memberships. \n(iii)  State-owned enterprise monitoring. As a prior action, in February 2019, the \ncabinet  approved  the  establishment  and  resourcing  of  the  Public  Enterprise \nMonitoring Unit in the DOF. The unit is responsible for reviewing public enterprise \nperformance and advising the government on issues such as public enterprise \noperations and governance; community service obligations; the appointment of \ndirectors; restructuring initiatives; and investments in, loans to, and guarantees for \npublic enterprises. \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s value addition and development partner coordination. ADB is coordinating with \nother development partners to ensure policy actions are correctly sequenced and the TA is well \ntargeted.25 Cooperation is particularly close with Australia and New Zealand. ADB also maintains \na close working relationship with the IMF, including joining the IMF\u2019s Article IV consultations in \nNauru in September 2019. ADB and New Zealand, which is cofinancing the program, have \ncoordinated policy dialogue through a single policy matrix. Australia is financing technical advisors \n \n23  The register covers government departments and key SOEs. \n24  The prioritization exercise also considered the general safety and security a planned infrastructure investment would \nprovide in the public space, which is particularly relevant to women. \n25  Development Coordination (accessible from the linked documents Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nto the DOF. Along with advisory support provided by the IMF\u2019s Pacific Financial Technical \nAssistance Centre, this support from Australia has helped the government improve its budget \ncontrol,  reporting,  and  transparency.  Two  regional  ADB  TA  projects  provided  international \nexpertise and advisory services to support six of the program\u2019s eight prior actions.26 \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n18.  The program is aligned with the following impact: public investment management and \nfiscal sustainability strengthened, which are crucial for the effective delivery of public services and \nthe achievement of inclusive growth. Nauru\u2019s public expenditure management will be improved in \nreform area 1 through the full functionalization of the FMIS, the introduction of new financial \ninstructions, the publication and public availability of budget documents and financial statements \nthat include public debt, increased funding of the NTF for future service delivery, and a review of \nprocurement practices that will enable the government to focus on its most pressing procurement \nissues (para. 14). Policy actions in reform area 2 will improve Nauru\u2019s public asset management \nby ensuring better information on the condition and maintenance requirements of public assets \nand the introduction of a framework to prioritize infrastructure spending to enhance asset service \nlife (para. 15). In reform area 3, the establishment of an overarching policy, legislative, and \nmonitoring framework for SOE governance will reduce the fiscal risks that poorly performing SOEs \nand SOE borrowing pose; and free up public resources for critical expenditures (para. 16). Taken \ntogether, the program reforms will promote the strategic allocation of resources, which will help \nNauru sustain a responsible fiscal position and achieve inclusive growth. By facilitating better \nasset  maintenance  and  improving  the  governance  of  SOEs,  the  program  will  also  create \nsynergies with ADB\u2019s infrastructure investments, including the new seaport and solar facility, \nwhich SOEs will own and manage.27 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n19.  The government has requested a grant not exceeding $5.00 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the program. The Government of \nNew Zealand will provide $0.32 million in budget support as cofinancing.28 The program will help \nthe government to meet its FY2020 budget financing gap, which is estimated at $15.8 million \nwithout budget support.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The program implementation period is from March 2018 to June 2020. The DOF will be \nthe  executing  agency,  responsible  for  the  program\u2019s  overall  implementation.  This  includes \noverseeing  and  coordinating  the  timely  implementation  of  agreed  policy  actions  with  the \nDepartment  of  Infrastructure  Development  and  the  SOEs,  providing  evidence  of  the \naccomplishment of the policy actions, and managing disbursements and the maintenance of \nrecords. The DOF and the Department of Infrastructure Development will be the implementing \nagencies. Program funding will be provided as a single tranche grant of $5 million and will be \n \n26  ADB. 2013.

The \ngovernment will provide the necessary counterpart funds to finance costs associated with the \nimplementation of the reforms under the program. Two regional ADB TA projects supported the \ngovernment to implement the prior actions, while a third regional ADB TA, approved in 2019, will \nsupport the government in implementing actions laid out in the PPPF.29 The proceeds of the \npolicy-based grant will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time).30 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n21.  Safeguards. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \nis classified category C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \nProgram activities are confined to policy and institutional reforms, and none will result in or lead \nto involuntary resettlement or affect indigenous peoples. No adverse environmental impacts have \nbeen identified. \n \n22.  Gender. While ADB\u2019s 2016 Fiscal Sustainability Reform Program was classified no \ngender elements, the program is classified effective gender mainstreaming and two of the three \nreform areas have gender indicators. In reform area 2, consideration of the job opportunities for \nwomen that a project will provide is among the economic and social criteria the government\u2019s \nintegrated  infrastructure  strategic  plan  sets  for  prioritizing  public  infrastructure  spending \n(para. 15). The government plans to incorporate the prioritization process into its budget planning \nbeginning in FY2021 as a PPPF measure. In reform area 3, Nauru\u2019s Public Enterprise Act, 2019 \nrequires public enterprises to promote gender equality in their employment practices and policies \nand on their boards (para. 16). To ensure that directors of public enterprises are fully aware of \ntheir new responsibilities under the Public Enterprise Act, the DOF will coordinate training with \ncurrent and prospective directors, with a target of at least 30% women, as a PPPF measure. \n \n23.  Poverty and social. The improved management of public expenditures and assets the \nprogram will bring about will help the government maintain public infrastructure and services in \nthe event of economic shocks or declining government revenues. This is critical to the well-being \nand living standards of low-income households and the country\u2019s population overall. Better SOE \ngovernance will also benefit the national welfare, given the dominance of underperforming SOEs \nin Nauru\u2019s small economy and the range of services they alone provide. By helping ensure a \nstrategic allocation of public resources, the program will help safeguard the responsible fiscal \nposition the country needs to improve the lives of its people. \n \n24.  Governance. Weaknesses in budget reporting, transparency, and execution have been \nreduced through prior actions completed in the program\u2019s reform area 1 (para. 14). Although the \ngovernment is able to implement its budget, challenges remain in the areas of procurement, cash \nreconciliation, debt management, financial reporting on government equities in SOEs, and policy-\nbased budgeting. Advisory services through development partner TA and ongoing policy dialogue \nare addressing some of these weaknesses.31   \n \n29  ADB. 2013.
