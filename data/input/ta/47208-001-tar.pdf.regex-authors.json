INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This technical assistance (TA)1 will support the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN)2 in its implementation of the ASEAN Integrated Food Security Framework (AIFSF)3 \nand the second phase of the Strategic Plan of Action for Food Security (SPAFS), which will \ncover 2015\u20132019. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) discussed the TA at the 33rd meeting of \nthe ASEAN Food Security Reserve Board (AFSRB) in Yogyakarta, Indonesia on 6\u20137 June 2013. \nThe members of the AFSRB endorsed the TA.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Rice prices spiked by as much as 300% during some months in 2007\u22122008, adversely \nimpacting about 13.7 million poor people in Southeast Asia.5 ASEAN responded by establishing \nthe  AIFSF  and  an  accompanying  SPAFS  for  2008\u20132013.  The  AIFSF  has  four  main \ncomponents:  (i)  food  security  and  emergency  shortage  relief;  (ii)  sustainable  food  trade \ndevelopment; (iii) integrated food security information system; and (iv) agricultural innovation. \nADB  technical  assistance  in  2010  for  the  ASEAN  Plus  Three  Integrated  Food  Security \nFramework supported the first three components, with funding from the Government of Japan \nthrough the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction.6 The TA facilitated the development of the \nprotocols for the ASEAN Plus Three Emergency Rice Reserve (APTERR).7 It piloted the multi-\nstakeholder ASEAN Rice Trade Forum as a platform to discuss evidence-based policies that \nwould be conducive to regional rice trade and investments and to make recommendations to a \nsenior officials meeting of the ASEAN ministers on agriculture and forestry (SOM-AMAF). It also \nhelped improve the regional food market information database. The TA was completed in \nOctober  2013  with  the  drafting  of  phase  two  of  the  SPAFS,  which  will  be  presented  for \nconsideration by the SOM-AMAF. \n \n3.  Considerable headway was made on implementing the SPAFS with the TA support, but \nmuch still needs to be done. The TA\u2019s key lesson was that ASEAN\u2019s regional public goods and \nservices are aimed in the right direction but need to be strengthened further to boost the \nresilience of ASEAN member states to volatility in rice prices. More specifically, improvements \nare necessary in ASEAN\u2019s (i) regional rice reserve system, (ii) rice and food trade policies, and \n(iii) regional food market information system.  \n \n4.  Although  implementation  of  the  APTERR  protocol  arrangements  since  the  reserve \nbecame operational in 2012 has been adequate and its response has been fairly quick, the \nAPTERR is still in its infancy and key issues need to be addressed. The first involves the need \nto identify the appropriate size of both the total reserve and individual country pledges. Of the \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 May 2014. \n2  ASEAN  comprises  Brunei  Darussalam,  Cambodia,  Indonesia,  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  Malaysia, \nMyanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n3  The AIFSF was drawn up in August 2008 during the 29th special senior officials meeting of the ASEAN ministers \non agriculture and forestry in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Its goal is to ensure long-term food security and to improve the \nlivelihoods of farmers in the ASEAN region. Its specific objectives are to (i) increase food production, (ii) reduce \npost-harvest losses, (iii) promote markets and trade for agriculture commodities and inputs, (iv) ensure food \nstability, (v) promote the availability of and accessibility to agriculture inputs, and (vi) operationalize regional food \nemergency relief arrangements.  \n4  The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n5  ADB. 2012. Food Security and Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: Key Challenges and Policy Issues. Manila.  \n6  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Support for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Plus Three Integrated \nFood Security Framework. Manila.  \n7  The agreement establishing the APTERR was signed by the ASEAN Plus Three Ministers on Agriculture and \nForestry on 7 October 2011 and came into force on 12 July 2012.  \n ", "2   \ncurrent virtual regional rice reserve, which is equivalent to 780,000 metric tons, more than two-\nthirds have been committed by the Plus Three, non-ASEAN countries\u2014the People\u2019s Republic \nof China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. The second relates to the as yet unmet need for \nthe APTERR to harness the untapped potential of the private sector and civil society to expand \nand  sustain  the  reserves  through  institutional  multiparty  arrangements  such  as  forward \ncontracts and management contracts. It may also be necessary to involve organizations such \nas the World Food Programme to strengthen the APTERR, since they have a track record in \nemergency response to food shortages and food storage and distribution. This could enlarge \nthe sources of reserves and ensure efficient and effective delivery systems. A third issue \nrelates to harnessing the role of regional reserves in assisting ASEAN member states that are \nin distress by complementing their national reserves. Other effective reserves are those that are \neasily  accessible  to  risk-prone  and  vulnerable  communities  within  each  country,  such  as \ncommunity-based food reserves or seed banks, all of which may need to be pilot tested.  \n \n5.  ASEAN countries play a critical role in the international rice markets, both globally and \nwithin Asia and the Pacific. In 2012\u20132013, the region accounted for 52% of the world\u2019s net rice \nexports, 17% of the net rice imports, 29% of the harvested area, 24% of global rice production, \nand 22% of the world\u2019s rice consumption.8 Policy decisions by ASEAN member states can help \ncalm or can shake the rice market, as witnessed during the food price crisis in 2007\u22122008. The \ncrisis undermined the confidence of market stakeholders in the rice trade. This was particularly \ntrue of ASEAN governments, which then revived national rice self-sufficiency programs. The \naggressive implementation of these programs has thinned the international rice trade further.9 \nThe programs have also adversely affected both the urban and rural poor, particularly by \nmaking it more difficult for consumers to procure affordable rice.10 \n \n6.  Building confidence in the international rice trade remains an important challenge as the \n2015 launch of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) draws closer. The AEC is aimed at \nfreer  movement  of  goods  and  persons  within  ASEAN,  but  the  ASEAN  Trade  in  Goods \nAgreement allows the ASEAN member states to request waivers on their individual obligations \nto eliminate tariffs and nontariff measures on imports of rice and sugar. They can also ban rice \nexports. How ASEAN decides to address these trade-restrictive policies will have important \nimplications for the integrity of the AEC. The rice policies of ASEAN countries will also affect \ntheir prospects for cooperating on food trade with other Asian and non-Asian players in the \ninternational rice market. To keep pace with progress in other sectors when the AEC integration \nkicks off in 2015, ASEAN should prepare as early as possible to bring the rice trade under a \nmore rules-based regime.  \n \n7.  Trade policies in ASEAN on foods other than rice also need to be seriously assessed, \nsince they will affect the development of food value chains and the building of a dynamic AEC. \nIt is important to strengthen the linkages of rice and food trade and investment policies among \nand between the ASEAN member states and other regional partnerships to achieve the robust \navailability and access of quality and nutritious food at affordable prices. The ASEAN Rice \nTrade Forum developed under the previous TA needs to be expanded to cover other food \ncommodities and to broaden regional cooperation to achieve stronger, evidence-based policy \nanalyses. This will require that procedures be developed and the AFSRB be strengthened so \n                                                \n8  E. Wailes and E. Chavez. 2013. ASEAN Rice Outlook 2012\u20132022. Paper presented at the Second ASEAN Rice \nTrade Forum. Yogyakarta. 4\u20135 June . \n9  The global rice trade is considered thin because only 7% of world rice production is traded, compared with 10% of \ncoarse grain and 16% of wheat production (footnote 8). \n10  R. Clarete. 2013. Rice Self-Sufficiency and Trade: An Option for Food Security in ASEAN. Paper presented at the \nSecond ASEAN Rice Trade Forum. Yogyakarta. 4\u20135 June. \n ", "  3 \nthat  it  can  serve  as  the  fulcrum  for  elevating  the  forum\u2019s  evidence-based  results  and \nrecommendations to ASEAN policy makers (e.g., the SOM-AMAF).  \n \n8.  Abnormal market behaviors that led to the 2007\u22122008 crisis\u2014hoarding at the household \nlevel, outsized import tenders, and export bans, for example\u2014were partly triggered by the \nabsence of accurate, timely information. To address this problem, the ASEAN Food Security \nInformation System (AFSIS) established network centers in 2013 to strengthen its capacity as a \nfood information service provider to the ASEAN Plus Three governments. This was a step in the \nright direction, but rice market players need more than just information. They also need market \nintelligence to keep abreast of the latest developments, emerging issues, and market directions \nover the short and medium terms in the rice and food value chain. This includes information on \nongoing or planned policy changes, harvest forecasts, and logistical bottlenecks. The AFSIS \nneeds  to  build  what  is  now  nationally  based  remote  sensing  system  capacity  that  lacks \ninternational  links  into  an  ASEAN  regional  network.  The  development  of  this  system  is \nnecessary for the efficient and effective implementation of a regional rice reserve system and for \npolicy analysis.  \n \nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.   The TA impact will be reduced food price volatility in the ASEAN region.11 The TA \noutcome will be improved resilience of the food trade to natural and economic shocks.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will have three outputs: (i) regional rice reserve system strengthened; (ii) policies \nthat will increase ASEAN rice and food trade and investments developed; and (iii) market \nintelligence capacity of AFSIS developed. \n \n11.  Output 1: Regional rice reserve system strengthened. Key activities will focus on \ngiving the APTERR the capacity to (i) develop transparent and accountable protocols for tier 1 \n(use  of  forward  contracts)  of  the  APTERR  protocols;  (ii)  provide  mechanisms  for  the \nconsideration of ASEAN or ASEAN Plus Three to identify the appropriate size of the regional \nreserve, ensure greater transparency of government-to-government transactions, and  enhance \nthe participation of the private sector, international bodies such as the World Food Programme, \nand civil society in managing the reserve and possibly mobilizing resources for it; (iii) pilot test \ncommunity-based  rice  or  food  reserves  or  seed  banks  in  at  least  two  low-income  rural \ncommunities in one ASEAN member state, with the support of internationally reputable Asian \nfarmers\u2019  associations\u2014such  as  the  Asian  Farmers\u2019  Association  for  Sustainable  Rural \nDevelopment and its Japan-based partner, Ainoukai;12 and (iv) disseminate knowledge products \nbased on the results of the pilot tests and other potential approaches to local and regional rice \nreserve  and  community-based  seed  banking.  These  activities  will  improve  the  APTERR\u2019s \ncapacity to respond to natural and economic disasters in ASEAN member states efficiently and \neffectively and thereby avert surges in rice and other food prices and minimize the potential \n                                                \n11 The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations provides annual estimates on domestic food price \nvolatility index.  http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-fs/ess-fadata/en/ \n12 Together with the Asian Farmers\u2019 Association, Ainoukai will assist in the community food and farming needs \nassessment through a participatory approach; conduct good agriculture practices on organic farming, storage, and \nprocessing; document and facilitate community-to-community and farmer-to-farmer learning exchange; and muster \nlessons and experiences for case study reports and forums. \n ", "4   \nimpact on the poor. The APTERR will also be able to showcase ex ante disaster preparedness \nmeasures that are community-driven and sustainable.  \n \n12.  Output 2: Policies that will increase ASEAN rice and food trade and investments \ndeveloped.  Key activities will include building the abilities of the AFSRB to (i) develop at least \ntwo rice and food trade-related policies for the SOM-AMAF to consider that reduce food price \nvolatility and are consistent with the AEC framework, (ii) create a  food trade and investment \nroad map for the consideration of the SOM-AMAF, (iii) expand the ASEAN Rice Trade Forum \ninto the ASEAN Food Trade Forum and put mechanisms in place for sustaining the forum, and \n(iv) conduct policy analysis and provide evidence-based policy recommendations to the SOM-\nAMAF.13 These activities will help facilitate rice and food trade and investments in ASEAN \nmember  states  and  increase  the  confidence  of  these  countries  that  this  trade  can  be  an \nexpeditious way to respond to exogenous shocks and prevent food price volatility. \n  \n13.  Output 3: Market intelligence capacity of AFSIS developed. Key activities include  \n(i) training the AFSIS and its associated research institutes on food security risks by using \nsatellite remote sensing, the Arkansas global rice and rice flow models, and inclusive food value \nchains  analysis;  and  (ii)  producing  market  intelligence  reports,  rice  market  outlooks,  and \nweather assessment reports. The TA will work with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency in \nlinking  all  ASEAN  member  states  to  the  remote  sensing  database  system  of  the  Greater \nMekong Subregion economies and Indonesia.14 The TA will enhance this database to provide a \nregional perspective and develop a sustainable, satellite-based drought monitoring and warning \nsystem for ASEAN. These activities will help provide timely and accurate projection reports that \nwill be needed for food reserve management and by food market players.  \n \n14.  Assumptions  and  risks. The TA has a low risk profile. Key assumptions are that  \n(i) food security will remain a priority of the ASEAN countries; (ii) ASEAN countries will continue \nto  provide  resources to  implement  the  APTERR,  the  Food Trade  Forum,  and  the  AFSIS;  \n(iii) access will be available to accurate, up-to-date information on government and private rice \nreserves; (iv) ASEAN governments will be open to reducing trade restrictions; and (v) AFSIS \nnetwork centers have a financial plan in place for sustaining operations. The risks are that (i) a \nseries of natural calamities could drain the region\u2019s rice inventories, and (ii) non-ASEAN players \nin the rice markets could adopt food trade restrictions.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. ASEAN will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of office accommodation, domestic transportation, remuneration \nand per diem of counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                \n13 Examples of policies that can be developed are (i) collective action on minimizing ad hoc rice export restrictions,  \n(ii) defined criteria for the issuance of rice and sugar waivers under the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement,  \n(iii) standardized rice quality or food quality standards, and (iv) coordinated policies that expand rice and food trade \nwith countries outside of ASEAN such as India and Pakistan. \n14 The system for the Greater Mekong Subregion was supported by ADB and the Japan Aerospace Exploration \nAgency through the Technical Assistance on Accelerating the Implementation of the Core Agriculture Support \nProgram (ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for Accelerating the Implementation of the Core Agriculture Support \nProgram. Manila). The system for Indonesia was supported by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency through \nits Space Application for Environment Prototype Project, \"Potential Drought Monitoring over Agriculture Area in \nJava Island, Indonesia.\u201d \n ", "  5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 2 years (October 2014\u2013September 2016). ADB will be \nthe executing agency through the Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Division of \nthe Southeast Asia Department.15 The ASEAN Secretariat will be the implementing agency. It \nhas established working relations with ADB and was the implementing agency for the previous \nTA. \n \n18.  The TA proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). All procurement will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time), \nand consultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas amended from time to time).  \n \n19.  The TA will require 30 person-months of international consulting services from a food \nsecurity economist, a community-based reserve expert,  a food trade expert,  an economist \nmodeler, a food market expert, and an expert in remote sensing. It will also require 24 person-\nmonths of national consulting services from a project coordinator, a project facilitator, and an \neditor. In view of the diversity of the TA\u2019s activities and needs, consultants will be selected on an \nindividual basis. The outline terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 3.  \n \n20.  The  ASEAN  Secretariat  will  hold  an  inception  workshop  within  2  months  after  TA \neffectiveness to firm up project activities and the schedule for each output. A midterm workshop \nwill be held within 12 months of TA effectiveness and the final workshop within 22 months. The \nASEAN Secretariat will submit the following reports to ADB: (i) an inception report, (ii) a midterm \nprogress report, (iii) the proceedings of the Food Trade Forum, (iv) draft reports of experts for \neach output, (v) a draft final report, and (vi) final report. The TA will be monitored and evaluated \nbased on the performance indicators outlined in Appendix 1 and through the timely submission \nof reports from the three ASEAN food security organizations\u2014the APTERR, the AFSRB, and \nthe AFSIS\u2014to the ASEAN Secretariat following on-site consultations and training. Performance \nwill be assessed during TA review missions.  \n \n21.   The knowledge products will be disseminated by the farmers\u2019 groups involved such as \nthe Asian Farmers\u2019 Association for Sustainable Rural Development; the ASEAN Secretariat; the \nthree ASEAN food security organizations and their government counterparts; and ADB. The TA \nwill disseminate knowledge products and good practices through social media, networks of \nparticipating stakeholders, policy papers, and briefing notes.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Food Security and Resilience of the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations Member States to Food Price Volatility, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n15 The administration of the TA by the Southeast Asia Department will help link the TA directly with ADB's investment \noperations in ASEAN countries, and ensure that both policy and investment recommendations of the TA will be \naddressed timely by the governments and ADB. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources \nDesign  Performance Targets and Indicators with  and Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Baselines  Mechanisms  and Risks  \nImpact  By 2018:    Assumption \nReduced food  The domestic food price volatility index  FAO Food  Food security \nprice volatility in  stabilized around 13.0.
