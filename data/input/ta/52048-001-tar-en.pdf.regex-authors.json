INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the implementation of \nthe Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) 2030 strategy, which aims to enhance \nCAREC\u2019s role as a regional cooperation platform to connect people, policies, and projects for \nshared and sustainable development. This TA builds on and continues the work completed under \nthe Technical Assistance for Enhancing Coordination of the CAREC Program,1 which has helped \nstrengthen  coordination  between  member  countries  and  development  partners  for  greater \neconomic  cooperation  and  integration,  and  has  supported  the  critical  role  that  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) plays as the secretariat of the CAREC Program. The CAREC 2030 \nstrategy, endorsed by the ministers of CAREC countries at the 16th Ministerial Conference held \non 27 October 2017 in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, serves as the regional cooperation strategy for the \nCAREC Program. The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration, 2016\u20132020.2 The country partnership strategies of member countries also support \nthe implementation of the CAREC Program.3 \n \n2.  The CAREC Program, now 17 years in operation, is a partnership of 11 member countries \nand development partners, working together to promote development through cooperation and \nhence help accelerate economic growth and poverty reduction.4 The CAREC Program is a \nproactive facilitator of regionally important projects and policy initiatives critical to sustainable and \ninclusive economic growth in the region. As of the end of 2017, investments in CAREC member \ncountries under CAREC amounted to $31.6 billion, covering 185 projects in CAREC\u2019s traditional \nareas of cooperation: transport, energy, trade, and economic corridor development.5  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The CAREC 2020 strategic framework guided CAREC operations since 2011. A midterm \nreview  of  it,  completed  in  2016,  noted  the  satisfactory  progress  achieved  thus  far,  while \nrecognizing the need to review CAREC\u2019s strategic coherence and the program\u2019s relevance. This \nwas against the backdrop of unexpected and significant changes in the international economic \nenvironment, which had a major impact on several CAREC countries, beginning with the adverse \nimpacts of the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis that lingered on in some countries. The subsequent fall \nin commodity prices in 2014 further damaged the balance sheets of hydrocarbon-exporting \ncountries, and the resulting recession dampened prospects of migrant labor and reduced the flow \nof remittances to labor-exporting countries. On top of this, the economic slowdown of the major \ntrading partners led to shrinking markets for exports originating in CAREC countries.  \n \n4.  At the same time, investment needs in the CAREC region continue to be large, while the \nmember countries\u2019 development priorities have shifted. All CAREC countries are signatories to \nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016. Technical Assistance for Enhancing Coordination of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \nProgram. Manila.   \n2 ADB. 2016. Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2016\u20132020: Promoting Connectivity, \nCompetitiveness, Regional Public Goods, and Collective Action for Asia and the Pacific. Manila.  \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 April 2018.  \n4  The CAREC member countries are Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, \nPakistan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The six original development \npartners are the Asian Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International \nMonetary Fund, the Islamic Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the World Bank. \nThe number of development partners is expected to expand under the CAREC 2030 strategy.  \n5  Of the total CAREC-related investments, ADB financed $11.4 billion ($1.5 billion during 2016\u20132017), and other \ndonors and CAREC governments contributed the rest. \n ", "2 \nas well as to the Paris Agreement reached at the 21st Conference of Parties of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change (COP21). This underscores the need for CAREC to \nconsider  member  countries\u2019  expectations  for  stronger  regional  cooperation  to  achieve \ninternational development goals.  \n \n5.  The midterm review also pointed out the need to address the following issues: (i) lack of \ndiversification of the CAREC agenda, and insufficient knowledge and policy work to support \ninvestment activities; (ii) limited flexibility of CAREC\u2019s institutional framework; and (iii) lack of a \nstrong and coherent results framework that includes monitorable indicators for all sectors of \nactivity.    \n \n6.  Building on the progress and lessons learned under CAREC 2020, the CAREC 2030 \nstrategy envisages deepening cooperation in the traditional operational areas while selectively \nexpanding into new areas in response to member countries\u2019 evolving needs. It prioritizes five \noperational clusters: (i) economic and financial stability; (ii) trade, tourism, and economic corridors; \n(iii)  infrastructure  and  economic  connectivity;  (iv) agriculture  and  water;  and  (v)  human \ndevelopment. Application of information and communication technology, climate resilience and \ndisaster risk management, and gender equality are crosscutting issues embedded in all clusters.   \n \n7.  Regional  projects  and  investments  will  be  complemented  with  policy  dialogue  and \nknowledge solutions. Moreover, CAREC will promote people-to-people and business-to-business \ncontacts, leading to greater employment opportunities and social and cultural understanding \nacross member countries.  Under  CAREC  2030,  CAREC\u2019s  institutional  framework  has  also \nundergone refinements, aiming at increasing the countries\u2019 ownership at both the policy and \nproject levels, enhancing the role of development partners by capitalizing on their areas of \ncomparative advantage to maximize their contributions, promoting engagement with the private \nsector and civil society, strengthening the effectiveness of the CAREC Secretariat, and leveraging \nCAREC Institute\u2019s knowledge support for quality development solutions.6  \n \n8.  CAREC will formulate a refined program results framework to monitor progress on CAREC \n2030 implementation. CAREC will strengthen results chains in its traditional operational areas to \nbe better aligned with the new strategy. Subsequently, CAREC will develop results frameworks \nin the new areas in a phased manner. Every 3 years, the CAREC secretariat will prepare a \ncomprehensive progress and evaluation report, and the first report will be developed in 2020.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: regional economic cooperation in the CAREC \nregion strengthened.7 The TA will have the following outcome: CAREC\u2019s role as a regional \ncooperation platform to connect people, policies, and projects in the region enhanced.8 \n \n                                                \n6  CAREC Institute is an intergovernmental organization contributing to the CAREC Program through knowledge \ngeneration and capacity building. It functioned as a virtual entity from 2009 to 2015. Its physical base was inaugurated \nin 2015 in Urumqi, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, People\u2019s Republic of China. CAREC Institute obtained its \nlegal status in August 2017. \n7  ADB. 2017. CAREC 2030: Connecting the Region for Shared and Sustainable Development. Manila.  \n8  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Regional initiatives in CAREC 2030\u2019s operational priorities conceptualized \nand implemented. The TA will further advance cooperation in the five operational clusters of \nCAREC 2030. It will support the development of scoping studies and organization of consultation \nworkshops to identify key issues and help converge the interest of member countries, particularly \nin the new areas of operations. This includes economic and financial stability, tourism, education, \nhealth, water resources management, food safety, and agricultural value chains. The scoping \nstudies will help identify niche areas for cooperation between member countries, as well as \ninvestment opportunities and scope for potential donor cofinancing. The TA will also support the \nformulation  of  a  new  CAREC  Integrated  Trade  Agenda  (CITA)  leading  to  2030,9 and  the \nidentification and feasibility of potential economic corridors in the region to help attract private \nsector  investments.  The  CAREC  secretariat  will  also  explore  intersubregional  cooperation \nopportunities.  \n \n11.  Output  2:  Policy  dialogue  and  knowledge  sharing  among  member  countries \nfacilitated. The TA will support the organization of the annual ministerial conference, which will \nserve as a high-level platform to discuss and debate important policy and strategic issues of \nregional relevance. These may include macroeconomic policy issues and measures to promote \nregional economic stability, such as countercyclical financing, capital market reforms and financial \ncooperation, and water and environmental issues. The CAREC secretariat will prepare policy \nbriefs to facilitate the dialogue. In addition, CAREC will organize sector-specific policy discussions \nand regional thematic forums for the exchange of experiences and best practices between \npolicymakers.    \n \n12.  Output 3: Coordination and information exchange among CAREC stakeholders \nincreased.  The  TA  will  support  the  operationalization  of  CAREC\u2019s  renewed  institutional \nframework, including (i) establishing flexible and demand-driven expert groups as needed to \nprovide rapid responses to the countries\u2019 emerging priorities and changing needs, (ii) promoting \npublic\u2013private  dialogue  through  the  organization  of  business  and  investment  forums,  and \n(iii) leveraging development partners\u2019 comparative advantage and ensuring greater transparency \nand  information  sharing.  CAREC  will  organize  a  CAREC  development  partners\u2019  forum. \nCoordination with other regional cooperation mechanisms, including the Belt and Road Initiative, \nEconomic Cooperation Organization, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation will also be \nstrengthened. The TA will support the annual Senior Officials\u2019 Meeting, National Focal Points\u2019 \nMeeting, and sector committee and subworking group meetings in coordination with host CAREC \ncountries.  \n \n13.  Output 4: Monitoring and evaluation mechanisms improved. The TA will support \n(i) the development of results frameworks at both sector and program levels with concrete \nindicators, baseline data, and data sources for outcome and outputs; (ii) regular maintenance of \nthe CAREC project database, including consolidating information of CAREC investments by \ndevelopment partners; and (iii) preparation of a 3-year CAREC progress and evaluation report in \n2020, to take stock of the progress during 2018\u20132020 based on the program results framework, \nincluding cluster- or sector-specific indicators. The report will be published on the CAREC website.  \n \n                                                \n9  The formulation of CITA 2030 is also supported under ADB. 2016. Technical Assistance for Implementation of Trade \nFacilitation Initiatives in Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation. Manila. A separate TA is being processed to \nsupport  the  implementation  of  CITA  2030  (ADB.  Implementing  Integrated  Trade  Agenda  in  CAREC. \nhttps://www.adb.org/projects/52011-001/main#project-overview). \n ", "4 \n14.  Output 5: CAREC outreach and promotion means diversified and strengthened. The \nTA will help boost public awareness of CAREC\u2019s role in member countries and beyond through \n(i) the organization of CAREC high-level panel discussions in other influential regional forums and \nevents, such as the Astana Economic Forum, in collaboration with other stakeholders; (ii) \noutreach  training  programs  for  country-based  CAREC  consultants  to  effectively  increase \nstakeholder engagement in their respective countries; and (iii) regular maintenance and update \nof contents in the CAREC website. In addition, the CAREC Program will reach its 20th anniversary \nin 2020. CAREC will produce and disseminate promotional materials, including a publication and \na video, to raise CAREC\u2019s profile.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $4 million, of which (i) $3 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others), and (ii) $1 million will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Fund.10 The  key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will administer the TA. The Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination \nDivision of the Central and West Asia Department (CWRD) will implement the TA by adopting a \n\u201cOne ADB\u201d approach. It will coordinate and work closely with CWRD\u2019s sector divisions as well as \nwith other operations and knowledge departments to design and implement regional initiatives in \nCAREC 2030\u2019s priority areas. It will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; procure goods; \norganize workshops and conferences; and monitor the TA implementation in coordination with \nCAREC consultants based in member countries.  \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 30 months from July 2018 to December 2020. ADB will \nengage about 31 person-months of international and 319 person-months of national consulting \nservices annually during the TA implementation period. International consultants will include \nsector and regional cooperation experts to provide technical advice and analytical support on a \nrange of issues relating to regional economic cooperation, and to support the implementation of \nCAREC strategies and action plans in CAREC 2030\u2019s sectors and areas of cooperation. National \nconsultants based at ADB headquarters and in the CAREC member countries will include (i) up \nto 11 national advisors to the CAREC national focal points, (ii) up to 11 regional cooperation \ncoordinators, (iii) two regional cooperation program officers and/or analysts, (iv) a web developer \nand administrator, (v) a website and publications expert, (vi) communications and engagement \nexperts, and (viii) an administrative coordinator. ADB will also engage international and national \nresource persons. The terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n18.  ADB will recruit consultants as individuals and not through a firm since (i) they will be \noperating in different countries, and (ii) their work and outputs are independent of each other. \nMoreover, given the wide range of operational areas under the CAREC 2030 strategy, it is unlikely \nthat a single consultancy firm will be able to provide highly qualified experts with a sound \nknowledge of the CAREC Program in all the areas required. The CAREC Unit within the Regional \nCooperation  and  Operations  Coordination  Division  of  CWRD  will  manage  all  individual \nconsultants.  \n \n                                                \n10 Established by ADB. Financing partner: the Government of Japan.  \n ", "5 \n19.  The TA equipment budget covers computers, software, accessories, and other small office \nequipment. ADB will engage individual consultants and will procure all TA-financed goods in \naccordance with its Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated \nproject  administration  instructions  and/or  staff  instructions.  TA  funds  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n20.  The CAREC unit will prepare and print publications for CAREC events such as the \nMinisterial Conference, Senior Officials\u2019 Meeting, and high-level policy forums, including the \nproduction of a special publication for CAREC\u2019s 20th anniversary in 2020. The target audience \ncomprises policymakers and government officials in CAREC\u2019s areas of cooperation, development \npartners, think thanks, civil society and the private sector. The CAREC unit will disseminate \npublications and outreach materials through ADB and CAREC websites, and high-level CAREC \nsessions in regional forums and events. Internal dissemination will also be done through activities \norganized by the RCI Thematic Group. The CAREC unit will maintain and update the CAREC \nwebsite on a regular basis.  \n \n21.
