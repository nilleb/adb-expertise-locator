INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested policy and advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the Ministry of \nEnvironmental Protection (MEP) in developing guidelines for natural resource assets appraisal, \naccounting, monitoring, and management in the PRC\u2019s national key ecological function zones \n(NKEFZs). The TA is included in ADB\u2019s PRC country operations business plan, 2016\u20132018.1 In \nSeptember 2016, ADB and MEP reached an agreement on the TA\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference.2   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  As part of its ecological civilization agenda, the government released the Integrated \nReform  Plan  for  Promoting  Ecological  Progress  in  September  2015.3 The  plan  contains \ninstitutional,  governance,  and  economic  reform  objectives  to  strengthen  property  rights  for \nnatural resource assets, improve spatial planning and management of protected areas, enhance \nthe role of market mechanisms in environmental governance and ecological conservation, and \nstrengthen  institutional  responsibilities  and  accountability  for  environmental  outcomes.  The \nreforms are intended to be underpinned by improved environmental information to support \nevidence-based  policies  and  decision-making.  However,  the  architecture  for  compiling  and \nevaluating environmental information remains weak, with inconsistent methods and capacity \nacross provinces. \n \n3.  At the national level, MEP is required to develop a methodology for appraisal of natural \nresources  that  will  facilitate  the  reforms,  and  to  guide  other  government  agencies  in \nimplementation and application. This policy and advisory TA will assist MEP in developing this \nenvironmental  information  system  by  supporting  the  development  of  guidelines  for  natural \nresource assets appraisal, accounting, monitoring, and management in the PRC\u2019s NKEFZs. The \nTA will help MEP to review gaps and consolidate ongoing efforts\u2014including with other PRC \nagencies\u2014to develop a methodology consistent with international best practice.   \n \n4.   The NKEFZs have been identified through the PRC\u2019s spatial planning policy as critical in \nmaintaining and enhancing many public goods and services delivered by natural ecosystems, \nsuch as water quality maintenance, flood regulation, nutrient cycling, food and fiber provision, \nclimate  mitigation,  and  adaptation  functions.4 The  PRC  has  25  NKEFZs  that  represent \nsubstantial  diversity  in  both  geographic  scale  and  natural  assets.  To  validate  the  new \nmethodology, the TA will use the new environmental information system to compile natural \nresource balance sheets in the Qinba Biodiversity Ecological Function Zone.  This will also build \nprovincial and local capacity.      \n \n5.   The compilation of environmental information is not an end in itself, but a contribution to \nimproved management of natural resources. Under the Integrated Reform Plan for Promoting \nEcological Progress, the development of natural resource balance sheets is intended to inform \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2016\u20132018.

Integrated Reform Plan for Promoting Ecological Progress. Beijing.  \nThe concept of an ecological civilization first emerged in 2007, and has developed into a key national governance \nstrategy for the PRC. \n4  Government of the PRC, State Council. 2010. National Main Functional Zoning Plan. Beijing. The plan, issued as \npart of the PRC\u2019s national-level spatial planning, categorizes the \"development-restricted regions\" into the (i) \nNKEFZs and (ii) agricultural zones. \n ", "2   \nimproved  management  interventions  in  the  NKEFZs,  as  well  as  reforms  in  performance \naccountability for institutions and officials, and the potential use of market-based mechanisms, \nincluding transfer payments, eco-compensation, and penalties for ecological damage. As such, \nthe  TA  will  produce  recommendations  for  applying  the  results  of  natural  resource  asset \nappraisal to these reform priorities.  \n \n6.  The TA supports the environmental objectives of the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan5 \nand  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2016\u20132020.6 ADB\u2019s  support  for  environmentally \nsustainable growth in the PRC is increasingly focused on intensifying knowledge cooperation \nand institutional and governance reform. In 2013, ADB provided TA to the PRC to improve the \ninstitutional  framework  for  environmental  statistics,  including  preparing  a  road  map  for \ninstitutional reform. In 2015, ADB approved TA that will support the National Development and \nReform Commission (NDRC) in testing the gross ecosystem product concept as a means to \nevaluate the effectiveness of eco-compensation schemes. In parallel and with the support of \nother development partners, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has initiated preparing pilot \nenvironmental  accounts,  in  a  framework  consistent  with  the  international  system  of \nenvironmental\u2013economic  accounting.  This  TA  will  build  on  these  efforts  to  improve  the \naccessibility  and  reliability  of  environmental  information,  and  will  provide  central  and  local \ngovernments with the tools and approaches necessary to gauge the quantity and quality of the \nNKEFZs\u2019  natural  resource  assets  in  a  consistent  and  standardized  framework.  It  will  also \nenhance MEP\u2019s national and local capacity to (i) monitor the NKEFZs\u2019 natural resource assets \nand ecosystem services, (ii) design and implement management interventions that will ensure \nsustained provision of ecosystem services in the NKEFZs, and (iii) evaluate the performance of \ninstitutions  and  officials  responsible  for  the  NKEFZs\u2019  environmental  management.  The \nenhanced institutional capacity will lead to improved maintenance of the NKEFZs\u2019 natural capital \nassets and sustained provision of ecosystem services to the PRC\u2019s economy and society. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be an improved system of monitoring, evaluation, and accountability for \npromoting ecological progress. The outcome will be enhanced national and local capacity for \nmonitoring and managing natural resource assets within the NKEFZs of the PRC. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  Outputs  will  be  the  (i)  development  of  a  methodology  for  natural  resource  asset \nappraisal  in  the  NKEFZs,  (ii)  demonstration  of  an  approach  to  compiling  natural  resource \nbalance sheets in pilot NKEFZs, and (iii) preparation of policy recommendations for applying \nnatural resource asset appraisal results to management of the NKEFZs. \n \n9.  Output 1: Methodology for natural resource asset appraisal in the national key \necological function zones developed. This output will develop the methodology using gap \nanalysis, literature review, and discussions between technical experts and partners. Proposed \nactivities include the following: \n                                                \n5  Government of the PRC. 2016.

Manila. \n ", "  3 \n(i)  review information and data gaps on natural resources in the NKEFZs, including \nwork by other PRC agencies, particularly the NBS, NDRC, the Ministry of Land \nand Resources, and the Ministry of Water;   \n(ii)  conduct technical workshops and expert group meetings to discuss and refine \nthe methodology; and \n(iii)  prepare draft technical guidelines to include targeted assets, assessment tools, \nindicators, valuation, and data analysis. \n \n10.  Output 2: Approach to compiling natural resource balance sheets in pilot national \nkey ecological function zones demonstrated. Based on the gap analysis and methodology \ndeveloped under output 1, MEP and the TA consultants will implement the draft approach in the \nQinba  Biodiversity  Ecological  Function  Zone,  with  other  potential  pilots  in  the  Ruoergai \nWetlands and/or the Dabie Mountain Soil and Water Retention Zone to be explored, subject to \ntiming and budget availability. Activities will include the following:  \n(i)  conduct workshops with sector agencies and local and provincial counterparts in \nthe Qinba Biodiversity Ecological Function Zone to discuss the methodology and \napproach for the pilot studies;   \n(ii)  conduct the natural resource asset appraisal in the Qinba Biodiversity Ecological \nFunction Zone with local and provincial counterparts;   \n(iii)  prepare detailed technical reports on the case studies, including results and \nimplementation challenges; and   \n(iv)  organize national and local workshops to discuss the pilot studies\u2019 findings, and \nrefine the evaluation methodology based on these studies. \n \n11.  Output 3: Policy recommendations for applying natural resource asset appraisal \nresults  to  management  of  the  national  key  ecological  function  zones  prepared. The \nfollowing recommendations for applying appraisal results to the NKEFZ policy and management \npriorities will be prepared: \n(i)  ongoing institutional, administrative, and resource requirements at provincial and \nnational levels for natural resource appraisal and monitoring; \n(ii)  market-based mechanisms for natural resources management, such as transfer \npayments, eco-compensation, and ecological damage penalties; and  \n(iii)  end-of-office auditing of officials responsible for managing natural resources. \n \n12.   The details of the TA-developed methodology will require discussion between technical \nexperts and policy makers. Engagement between MEP, technical experts, and stakeholders at \nnational  and  provincial  levels  will  be  crucial  to  avoid  the  risk  of  disagreement  on  the \nmethodological guidelines or policy recommendations (Appendix 1). The TA implementation will \nprioritize engaging stakeholders during inception and fine-tuning the approach.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \n \n14.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace, office supplies and equipment, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and other \nin-kind contributions.  \n \n ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MEP will be the executing agency and will establish a TA management office (TMO) in \nthe MEP\u2013Foreign Economic Cooperation Office to carry out day-to-day policy and advisory TA \noperations.  The  director  of  MEP\u2013Foreign  Economic  Cooperation  Office\u2019s  International \nCooperation Division will serve as the TMO leader responsible for daily operational matters \namong ADB, the TA consultants, MEP, and other government agencies. The TMO will include \nrepresentatives  from  MEP\u2019s  Department  of  Nature  and  Ecology  Conservation  and  the \nDepartment of International Cooperation. The TMO will provide guidance on implementation \nissues and lead coordination with government agencies, including the NBS, NDRC, and the \nNational Audit Office. \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented from 1 October 2016 to 31 March 2018. The TA is expected \nto require about 32 person-months of consulting services. The TA will require one international \nspecialist  (deputy  team  leader  and  environmental  accounting  specialist)  and  four  national \nspecialists  (team  leader  and  environmental  assessment  and  management  specialist, \nenvironmental economics and policy specialist, ecological services evaluation specialist, and \nremote sensing and geographical information system specialist) for implementation. The outline \nterms of reference for the consultants is provided in Appendix 3. The specialists will be engaged \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) \nthrough a firm, using the quality- and cost-based selection method. The weighted ratio of \ntechnical to financial components will be 90:10. An output-based contract may be considered for \nnegotiation  with  the  successful  firm.  The  TA  disbursements  will  be  made  following  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).
