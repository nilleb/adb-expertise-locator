The  Pacific  region  is  characterized  by  high  public  expenditures  and  significant \ngovernment  ownership  of  assets.  Inadequate  oversight  of  these  resources  and  the  public \nfinancial management (PFM) systems that are used to account for them undermines the stability \nof governments and the wellbeing of Pacific peoples. This technical assistance (TA) will support \ninitiatives to strengthen Pacific PFM and reduce fiduciary risk, including by providing accounting \nand internal audit support, and designing a competency-based capacity development program. \nThe design reflects consultations undertaken over the past 2 years, including with the Pacific \nFinancial  Technical  Assistance  Centre  (PFTAC),  the  Pacific  Islands  Financial  Managers \nAssociation (PIFMA) and the Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions (PASAI). \n \n2.  The assistance is consistent with the strategies, priorities and commitments of Pacific \ncountries and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), including the Pacific Plan, which seeks to \nenhance good governance, economic growth, sustainable development and security through \nregionalism.1 The TA will contribute to strategic objective 12 of the Pacific Plan, which aims to \nimprove  transparency,  accountability,  equity  and  efficiency  in  the  management  and  use  of \nresources in the Pacific. The TA is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy 2005\u20132009, which \nidentifies strengthened government transparency and accountability as a key result area,2 and with \nADB\u2019s second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan (GACAP II), which is focused on \nimproving ADB\u2019s performance in implementing governance and anticorruption policies in sectors \nwhere ADB is active.3 Finally, in supporting the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness,4 \nrecipient  countries  have  committed  to  publishing  timely,  transparent,  and  reliable  financial \nreports, while development partners (including ADB) have committed to relying to the maximum \nextent possible on country PFM systems.5 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  In the Pacific region, the public sector represents over 32% of total gross domestic \nproduct, and annual public sector expenditures exceed $8.8 billion.7 However, the PFM systems \nthat are used to manage these resources are in many cases inadequate. For instance, the 2008 \nADB country performance assessment exercise assigned ratings to 10 Pacific countries. The \naverage rating for the quality of budgetary and financial management was 3.3 (out of a possible \n6.0); three countries received low ratings of 2.5. Although some Pacific countries have made \nsignificant progress in reducing financial reporting backlogs, others have far to go: one country \nhas financial reporting arrears of 10 years, and several others are in arrears by 3\u20134 years. The \nabsence  or  late  provision  of  financial  information  fundamentally  undermines  accountability \nmechanisms.  Furthermore,  without  timely  and  reliable  information  on  emerging  issues, \npolicymakers are unable to react in a timely manner to emerging crises and problems.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. 2005.

Evidence  suggests  that  the  benefits  stemming  from  sound  PFM  systems  are \ndisproportionally important for small states. Fiscal transparency can support fiscal adjustments in \nsmall states by creating wider public support and understanding of government policies. In \naddition, transparency can help investors make better-informed assessments on risk and lending \nto small states, and can reassure financial markets and donors regarding a government\u2019s fiscal \ngoals.8 A recent study suggested that improving governance through increased government \neffectiveness may help small states reduce public and external debt and thus support fiscal \nadjustment, indicating that small states should strive to improve their institutional capacity to \ndevise and implement government policies and improve the quality of public services. Measures \nthat enhance policy credibility, such as increasing the accountability of the government to fiscal \ntargets, regular publication of economic data, and improving transparency, should also help \nincrease government effectiveness.9 \n \n5.  Moreover, developing countries and donors are not on track to meet the Paris Declaration \ncommitments. On 4 September 2008, developing countries\u2019 ministers and heads of development \npartner agencies, including ADB, agreed to accelerate and deepen implementation of the Paris \nDeclaration. Relevant commitments include strengthening PFM systems, aiming to provide 66% of \naid  through  program-based  approaches,  and  channeling  50%  or  more  of  government-to-\ngovernment assistance through country fiduciary systems.10 \n \n6.  ADB  recognizes  the  importance  of  PFM  in  the  Pacific  and  has  provided  significant \nsupport to improve PFM arrangements. Since 1994, ADB has provided $5.5 million support to \nthe multi-donor, Fiji Islands-based PFTAC, which is operated by the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF).11 ADB is also supporting the design and implementation of the Pacific Regional Audit \nInitiative (PRAI), which is a Pacific Plan initiative.12 After an extensive consultation process, the \nApril 2008 congress of the 25-member PASAI endorsed the PRAI design; the initiative was also \nendorsed by Pacific island leaders at the August 2008 meeting of the Pacific Island Forum (PIF). \nAmong other things, the PRAI involves establishing a subregional auditing model in which \nparticipating countries (Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu) will pool national and external resources to \njointly undertake audits.  \n \n7.  These and other efforts have produced positive results in several aspects of PFM. For \ninstance, public auditing in the Pacific region overall has advanced substantially in the past \ndecade, with numerous audit backlogs cleared and a significant improvement in audit quality.13 \nLikewise, the application in the Pacific of the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability \n(PEFA) PFM Assessment Framework reveals that planning and budget processes are rated \nsatisfactorily (B+ average). Given their potential to better link policy with budgets and to enable \nbetter  decision-making,  it  is  not  surprising  that  emphasis  has  been  placed  on  developing \n                                                 \n8   Daniel, James, Jeffrey Davis, Manal Fouad, and Caroline Van Rijckeghem, 2006, Fiscal Adjustment for Stability \nand Growth.

A Pacific auditor-general reported \nrecently to their public accounts committee that \u201cPut simply, sometimes there is nothing to audit \nbecause  the  records  are  non-existent\u201d  \u2026  \u201cthere  was  a  lack  of  bank  reconciliations,  poor \ndocumentation supporting the transactions, lack of physical stocktakes \u2026 and ineffective budget \ncontrols. [\u2026 Moreover, the Office has been] auditing accounts and records that are sometimes \nsix years old.\u201d15 The situation described is not uncommon in the Pacific. \n \n8.  As  with  supreme  audit  institutions,  the  effectiveness  of  Pacific  finance  ministries  is \ngenerally constrained by their ability to attract, retain, and develop qualified staff due to their \nsmall sizes and remote locations, difficulties in competing with the private sector for qualified \nstaff, often-constrained budgets, and limited access to professional accounting bodies. However, \nthere is a range of capacities, with some Pacific finance ministries meeting best practice in many \nrespects.  In  general,  PFM  capacity-development  efforts  to  date  have  been  somewhat \nfragmented and issue-based, rather than being structured around a competency framework. \n \n9.  The quality and timeliness of public sector financial reporting, including for state-owned \nenterprises, is also variable. In that connection, financial reporting awards, including for the \npublic sector, are common internationally and highlight and encourage sound financial reporting \npractices. For instance, the Government Finance Officers Association of Canada and the United \nStates established the certificate of achievement for excellence in financial reporting program in \n1945 to encourage governments to prepare comprehensive annual financial reports that provide \nevidence of the spirit of transparency.16 Likewise, the Fiji Islands-based South Pacific Stock \nExchange inaugurated its annual report competition in 1981; since then the competition has \nevolved to include differing organization types, including parastatals. The judging panel comes \nfrom various professional financial institutions including accountants, capital market, academics, \nand other financial institutions.17 \n \n10.  Recognizing these issues and considerations, the PFTAC-sponsored PIFMA and PASAI \nhave in the past 2 years discussed the need for a Pacific regional PFM initiative to parallel the \nPRAI. Among other things, the March 2008 PIFMA meeting agreed that (i) development partners \nwould consider options for providing support to a Pacific regional PFM initiative; (ii) PIFMA will \nmove  beyond  its  role  to  date  as  discussion  and  training  forum  to  being  a  professional \nassociation (similar to PASAI); and (iii) PIFMA will establish working groups, including to identify \nPFM competencies. In line with these considerations, PFTAC is undertaking a pilot study (for Fiji \nIslands,  Palau,  Cook  Islands,  and  Tonga)  to  evaluate  the  status  of  internal  auditing \narrangements, identify training and organizational needs, and recommend possible solutions to \nimplement strengthened internal auditing in selected Pacific island countries.  \n \n                                                 \n14   See, for instance, Wynne, Andy. 2005.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  proposed  project  is  intended  to  promote  good  governance  through  improved \ntransparency,  accountability,  and  efficiency  in  managing  and  using  public  resources  in  the \nPacific.18 Specifically, the proposed TA is intended to strengthen the capacity of Pacific island \ngovernments to manage public resources. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA is intended to deliver four outputs during the period 2009\u20132011.  \n \n13.  Strengthened  Internal  Auditing  and  Financial  Reporting. Building on the PFTAC \ndiagnostic study of internal auditing for four pilot countries,19 the TA will support, under PFTAC \nguidance (i) the preparation of generic records management, and internal control and internal \naudit manuals; and (ii) activities that specifically target the pilot countries, including (a) tailoring \nof the manuals; (b) training on strengthened records management, internal control and internal \nauditing; and (c) initial implementation of strengthened records management, internal control \nand  internal  auditing  arrangements.  In  relation  to  accounting  and  financial  reporting,  and \nrecognizing PIFMA\u2019s call for accounting and financial reporting support along the lines of the \nPRAI  subregional  audit  support  (SAS)  program,  assistance  will  be  provided  to  three  pilot \ncountries to develop financial reporting frameworks in line with the cash basis international \npublic sector accounting standard. Advice will also be provided on particular accounting issues \non a demand basis. The TA will also support a scoping and design study of options for using a \ncooperative  approach,  modeled  on  the  PRAI  SAS  program,  to  support  internal  auditing, \naccounting and financial reporting arrangements (including providing support to reduce financial \nreporting backlogs and address infrastructure financial management issues), including for the \ninternal  auditing  pilot  countries  and  for  the  SAS  program  countries  (Kiribati,  Nauru,  and \nTuvalu).20 The  scoping  and  design  study  will  consider  cost-recovery  options  and  potential \nfunding modalities. \n \n14.  Structured PFM Capacity Development Program Designed. Under PFTAC/PIFMA\u2019s \nguidance, generic PFM competencies will be identified and a core PFM competency model \ndeveloped, on the basis of which a structured and costed PFM capacity development program \nwill be prepared for consideration by potential funders. The structured program design will \nconsider options for cost recovery21 and will examine similar initiatives, including the PASAI \ncompetency framework and the structured capacity development program that will be designed \nthrough the PRAI. An analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats will be \nundertaken  in  preparing  the  competency  model  and  designing  the  capacity  development \nprogram. \n \n15.  Strengthened Aid Coordination and Debt Management. In keeping with the Accra \nAgenda for Action commitments, which call for donors to support and invest in strengthening the \n                                                 \n18   This is in keeping with the objective of Pacific Plan (footnote 1), initiative 12. \n19   The selection of pilot countries remains tentative (including Cook Islands, Palau and Tonga), and may change or \nbe extended in consultation with PFTAC and potential participants. The Fiji Islands will not be included in the pilot. \nActivities will commence only when no-objection advice is confirmed. \n20   Subject to no-objection confirmation from these countries. \n21   See, for instance, IMF. 2008. IMF Executive Board Discusses the Policy for Country Contributions for Capacity \nBuilding.  Public  Information  Notice  No.  08/129.  Washington,  DC  (3  October).

Sound PFM Advocated. The TA will advocate for the importance of sound PFM through \njournal and media articles, and through support for participation in PEFA PFM assessments and \nPFM conferences and meetings. In addition, in collaboration with PFTAC/PIFMA and regional \nacademic  institutions,  it  will  establish  annual  Pacific  financial  reporting  awards.  Potential \ncategories include best annual report by a corporate, best annual report by a public sector \nnonprofit  organization  and  best  annual  report  by  a  public  sector  commercial  organization. \nHowever, the initial focus of support under the TA will be on financial reporting by parastatals, \nincluding state-owned enterprises. The TA will support the design and establishment of the \nPacific  financial  reporting  awards,  which  will  involve  establishing linkages  with professional \naccounting associations, PASAI, and universities and colleges, with an initial focus on state-\nowned enterprise reports from pilot countries. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA\u2019s total cost is estimated at $1,700,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis ($1,500,000) by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The remainder of the cost ($200,000) \nwill be contributed through in-kind contributions from participating governments (Appendix 3). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Department  will  be  the  executing  agency.  PFTAC  will  provide \nimplementation guidance. The TA will require (i) international consultants (an estimated 37 \nperson-months of inputs) with skills and expertise in PFM, internal auditing, accounting and \nfinancial reporting, aid coordination and debt management, and capacity development; and (ii) \nnational and regional consultants (an estimated 18 person-months of inputs) with skills and \nexpertise  in  accounting,  internal  auditing,  financial  reporting,  aid  coordination  and  debt \nmanagement, and capacity development. It is desirable that consultants have demonstrated \nprevious successful experience working in the Pacific islands. Appendix 3 details deliverables \nand  reporting  requirements,  but  these  may  change  during  implementation  to  provide  the \nflexibility to meet changing needs and respond to the guidance of PIFMA and PFTAC. \n \n19.  All consultants will be engaged as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Outline terms of reference for \nconsulting services are in Appendix 3. Disbursements under the TA will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2008, as amended from time to time). TA \nactivities will be implemented over a 36-month period starting in January 2009, with a December \n2011 completion date. The TA is intended to pilot innovative PFM approaches in the Pacific \nregion and, subject to performance of the pilot approaches, consideration may be given to \nfurther expanding the activities to additional countries and sectors. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis for \nStrengthening  Public  Financial  Management  in  Pacific  Developing  Member  Countries,  and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets and/or  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact       \nBetter governance  Demonstrated public financial  ADB\u2019s country  Assumption \nthrough improved  management (PFM)  performance assessments \nPolitical commitment to, \ntransparency,  improvements, taking into \nCountry PEFA PFM \nand community support \naccountability, and  account regional and national \nassessments \nfor, good governance \nefficiency in  circumstances. \nPFTAC reports and  and sound public \nmanaging and using \nImprovement (averaging one-\nstocktakes  financial management \npublic resources in \nstep) by the end of 2012 of \nremains strong \nthe Pacific \nrelevant public expenditure and \nfinancial accountability (PEFA) \nperformance indicators \nOutcome      Assumptions \nStrengthened  Improvement in participating  PEFA PFM assessments \nParticipating jurisdictions \ncapacity of selected  countries by the end of 2012 of \nPFTAC reports and  remain committed to \nPacific island  the PEFA PI-26 indicator to an \nstocktakes  improving PFM \ngovernments to  average B rating \narrangements and acting \nmanage public  External auditors\u2019 reports \nReduction in participating  on PFTAC\u2019s advice and \nresources \ncountries of repetitive external    capacity-building \naudit recommendations regarding  measures. \nweak record-keeping and internal \ncontrols \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
