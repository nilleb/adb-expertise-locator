INTRODUCTION \n1.  In  April  2007,  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Agriculture  Ministers\u2019  Meeting \nendorsed  the  Strategic  Framework  for  Subregional  Cooperation  in  Agriculture  and  the  Core \nAgriculture Support Program (CASP) for 2006\u20132010.1 The CASP consists of priority projects under \nfive strategic components designed to sustain and further accelerate cooperation in agriculture: (i) \nfacilitating cross-border agricultural trade and investment, (ii) promoting public-private partnerships \nin sharing agricultural information, (iii) enhancing capacity in agricultural science and technology, \n(iv) establishing emergency response mechanisms for agricultural and natural resource crises, and \n(v) strengthening institutional linkages and mechanisms for cooperation. At their third summit, held \non 31 March 2008 in Vientiane, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, GMS leaders were greatly \nencouraged by the concrete results delivered by the GMS program.  In agriculture, the leaders \nrecognized current initiatives to promote cross-border agricultural trade, ensure food safety, and \nimprove farmers\u2019 livelihoods. In their Joint Summit Declaration, the leaders gave explicit directives \non the immediate focus of agricultural cooperation, specifically (i) implementing the GMS initiative \non rural renewable energy (RRE) development; (ii) expanding control programs for trans-boundary \nanimal  diseases,  and  (iii)  supporting  access  to  agricultural  information  in  rural  areas.  These \nconcerns are incorporated in the priority projects under the CASP and the Vientiane Plan of Action \nfor GMS Development (2008\u20132012), 2 which was endorsed during the Third GMS Summit. \n2.  Under regional technical assistance (RETA) for the Expansion of Subregional Cooperation \nin Agriculture in the Greater Mekong Subregion,3 support was provided to (i) establish a secretariat \nof the Working Group on Agriculture (WGA) to provide technical backstopping for GMS WGA \nactivities; (ii) organize key meetings and workshops; (iii) develop the Strategic Framework for \nSubregional Cooperation in Agriculture and the CASP; (iv) establish the Agriculture Information \nNetwork Service (AINS); and (v) conduct studies and consultations on bioenergy development in \nthe  GMS,  including  a  preliminary  assessment  of  strategies  and  options  for  GMS  RRE \ndevelopment.  Under  RETA  6324,  a  WGA  National  Coordinator  has  been  appointed  in  each \nparticipating GMS country. This RETA, which is a follow-up of RETA 6324, will establish a WGA \nNational Secretariat in each country composed of a WGA National Coordinator and Support Staff. \nRETA 6324 is expected to be completed by June 2009. This follow-up RETA is crucial in further \naccelerating the implementation of the CASP and initiatives under the Vientiane Plan of Action.  \n3.  The Fact-Finding Mission for the RETA was done during staff visits to the GMS countries \nand through a collective consultation with the member countries and key development partners at \nthe fifth meeting of the WGA (WGA-5).4 \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The Strategic Framework for Subregional Cooperation in Agriculture 2006\u20132010 identified a \nnumber of issues and challenges regarding GMS cooperation in agriculture. There is a need to \nintensify efforts under the CASP to help address emerging global concerns, including climate \nchange, rising food prices, water security, and rising rural energy demand. In view of volatile food, \nenergy, and input prices, there is an urgent need to prioritize areas of further cooperation among \nGMS countries to ensure subregional food security. An effective agricultural strategy involves \noptimizing outputs and benefits from agriculture through the implementation of biotechnology and \nbiosafety  policies  and  developing  new  areas  in  agriculture  through  renewable  energy  crops. \nInformation and technology on these and other areas of agriculture can be disseminated and \nshared in the GMS through AINS, established under RETA 6324. Similarly, cross-border trade and \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007. Strategic Framework for Subregional Cooperation in Agriculture 2006\u20132010.

Manila (TA 6324-REG). \n4  The WGA-5 meeting was held on 22\u201324 September 2008 in Vientiane. \n ", "2   \ncontract farming can stimulate agricultural investments and significantly contribute to achieving \nfood  security  in  the  subregion.  Regional  cooperation  and  integration,  one  of  the  five  core \nspecializations that the Asian Development Bank (ADB)5 will focus on, is an effective instrument for \naccelerating economic growth, reducing poverty, raising productivity, and strengthening institutions.    \n5.   Application  of  Advanced  Science  and  Technology.  The recent food crisis affected \nmillions of households in Asia and highlighted agriculture\u2019s strategic role in poverty reduction. The \napplication of advanced agricultural science and technology, including biotechnology and biosafety, \nprovides opportunities for the GMS to harness the subregion\u2019s agro-biodiversity to sustainably \nimprove agricultural production and its safety standards to strengthen food security and contribute \nto poverty alleviation.  \n6.   Role of Rural Renewable Energy. The broader use of RRE sources, especially biomass, \nbiogas, biodiesel, and bioethanol, is seen as an important option to meet energy demand in rural \nareas, mitigate environmental problems, and help to spur growth in agriculture and the rural sector. \nModern bioenergy offers a promising alternative to traditional fuels such as firewood and charcoal. \nThe  WGA  recently  concluded  a  preliminary  assessment  of  strategies  and  options  for  RRE \ndevelopment in the GMS and prepared a draft framework for it.6 For GMS countries, developing a \nnational strategy for RRE development is crucial in helping governments and policymakers make \ninformed decisions, especially in light of diverse findings on energy crops and their implications for \nfood security. \n7.   Enhancing Food Security through Cross-Border Trade. Soaring prices for food, energy, \nand agricultural inputs will require a strategic GMS response and enhanced cooperation among \nGMS countries to ensure subregional food security amid the complex challenges posed by climate \nchange. This will require a common assessment framework for impacts on farmers and rural \ncommunities and cooperation on policy, information, and technology to accelerate the medium-\nterm  growth  of  agriculture,  including  the  farming  of  alternative  sources  of  energy.  Another \nimportant area is facilitation of agricultural development and trade in a way that ensures the \nequitable  distribution  of  benefits.  The  GMS  program\u2019s  development  of  economic  corridors \ncontributes to increased trade and investment among GMS countries. Contract farming is seen as \na major growth area in cross-border trade, especially in the emerging biofuel industry. Also, the \nadoption of harmonized sanitary and phytosanitary standards for agricultural products to facilitate \nintraregional  trade  is  an  important  area  of  focus.  The  AINS  website  will  enable  the  efficient \nexchange of information between suppliers and traders of agricultural products. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n8.  The  RETA7 will  enable  the  WGA  to  respond  to  the  priority  needs  identified  in  GMS \ncountries during the Third GMS Summit. It will further contribute to efforts to strengthen food and \nenergy security, while addressing the challenge of climate change in the subregion. It has five \nmajor components: (i) component 1: biotechnology and biosafety; (ii) component 2: AINS; (iii) \ncomponent 3: rural renewable energy development; (iv) component 4: food security and cross-\nborder agricultural trade and investment; and (v) component 5: regional cooperation. \n \n                                                 \n5 ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n6 The RRE initiative in the GMS was formally launched during the Planning Workshop on Strategies and Options for \nIntegrating Biofuels and Rural Renewable Energy for Poverty Reduction on 11\u201313 June 2007 in Bangkok, Thailand. \nAn outline of the regional strategic framework for RRE development was endorsed during the WGA-5 meeting by GMS \nnational coordinators. \n7  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 September 2008. \n ", "  3\nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The main impact of the RETA is an agriculture sector in the GMS that is more integrated \nand  consistent  with  the  goal  of  CASP.  The  expected  outcome  is  enhanced  GMS  regional \ncooperation and investment in CASP. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The RETA will have five main outputs: (i) implementation of the strategy for biotechnology \nand  biosafety  initiated,  (ii)  agriculture  information  and  network  service  development  and  use \npromoted, (iii) rural renewable energy development strategy supported, (iv) food security and \ncross-border agriculture trade strategies developed, and (v) WGA Secretariat strengthened. \n11.  Component  1:  Implementation  of  the  Strategy  for  Biotechnology  and  Biosafety \nInitiated.  The  RETA  on  Strengthening  Capacity  and  Regional  Cooperation  in  Advanced \nAgricultural Science and Technology (Phase I)8 was able to (i) increase basic awareness about \nadvanced agricultural science and technology and related food safety issues among key GMS \nstakeholders, (ii) strengthen the technical capacity of relevant GMS institutions, and (iii) develop a \nsubregional strategic framework and action plan for biotechnology and biosafety for the GMS.9 \nSpecific activities included conducting biotechnology and biosafety workshops, forums, special \nstudies, and training courses for (i) strengthening capacity in GMS countries for policy formulation \nand implementation; (ii) strengthening regional cooperation on biotechnology and biosafety in the \nGMS, including the sharing of technical and human resources and the establishment of regional \nmechanisms; (iii) establishing a regional information management system for biotechnology and \nbiosafety such as a web-based information gateway and platform for the GMS to complement \nAINS; and (iv) enhancing the capacity in GMS countries to safely apply non-genetically modified \nbiotechnology. This component will be linked with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) \nRegional Technical Cooperation Programme (TCP) Facility on Biosafety. \n12.  Component 2: Agriculture Information and Network Service Development and Use \nPromoted. The objective of AINS is to provide access to up-to-date information on agriculture in \nthe GMS to support the exchange of information and foster interregional trade in agricultural \nproduce and value-added products. RETA 6324 was able to (i) establish AINS servers in each \nGMS country in national languages with content maintenance provided by national agricultural \ninformation services, (ii) provide capacity development for national focal points and leaders of host \norganizations, and (iii) launch the AINS website with content collated and processed by each host \norganization.  However,  the  long-term  objective  of  establishing  a  trading  platform  to  facilitate \ngreater economic and trade activities in agriculture, still needs development to become operational. \nThe RETA will support the maintenance and extension of the operational AINS website. It will \nenable a widening of the AINS network base and provide capacity development for the AINS \nnetwork focal points through workshops on the use of information technology in agriculture for \nGMS member countries. It will support an annual GMS AINS coordination and planning workshop. \nInformation on the CASP will be disseminated through the AINS website. The FAO will link its food \nsecurity monitoring system to the AINS through populating critical data related to soaring food \nprices through FAO\u2019s monthly Asia-Pacific Food Situation Update. AINS can also link up with the \nAsian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) distance learning and information and communication \ntechnology (ICT) program. \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2004.

Regional Strategic Framework and Action Plan for Biotechnology and Biosafety for the GMS (Volume I) \nand Supporting Technical Papers (Volume II). Manila. \n ", "4   \n13.  Component 3: Rural Renewable Energy (RRE) Development Strategy Supported. The \nRETA will support activities in the RRE initiative, including (i) developing an implementation plan \nfor the regional strategic framework on RRE development; (ii) in-depth studies and an assessment \nof conducting pilot demonstration and training activities in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC); \nand (iii) workshops, surveys, seminars, and trainings in the PRC. There are significant implications \nfor land use and land conversion resulting from the development of RRE crop cultivation and \nfeedstock production through contract farming, as well as other means of trading land, labor, and \ncapital in GMS countries. A regional approach to RRE development covering biofuels and other \nsources such as biogas and biomass will be beneficial to the GMS. The RRE initiative will have \nstrong linkages to national investment plans for RRE in the GMS and selected countries in other \nregions. This component will be linked to FAO\u2019s regional biofuels TCP on poverty reduction and \nbiofuels in the GMS. \n14.  Component  4:  Food  Security  and  Cross-Border  Agricultural  Trade  Strategies \nDeveloped. To enhance food security and cross-border trade in the GMS, the RETA will (i) \ndevelop a food security strategic framework for the GMS and a regional strategy to address \nspecific cross-border agricultural trade issues, including the strengthening of institutional capacity \non food safety and sanitary and phytosanitary standards; (ii) support a comprehensive assessment \nof agriculture trade competitiveness in the GMS, including demand and supply of agricultural \nproducts, cross-border agriculture resource and market information systems, and an analysis of the \ncosts and benefits of corridor development; and (iii) organize policy forums and dialogues. The \nWGA Secretariat will link up with (i) FAO and International Fund for Agricultural Development \n(IFAD)  joint  value  chain  development  project  that  covers  cross-border  trade  and  south-south \ncooperation in the GMS; and (ii) FAO\u2019s TCP facility on monitoring food market development under \nits initiative for soaring food prices. \n15.  Component 5: WGA Secretariat Strengthened. In pursuit of subregional cooperation in \nagriculture, the WGA will continue to serve as the mechanism by which GMS member countries \nare  able  to  come  together,  discuss,  and  collectively  agree  on  action  programs  to  address \nsubregional issues, challenges, and opportunities in agriculture. An expected output from this \nRETA is the strengthened capacity of GMS countries to coordinate and communicate on regional \nissues  and  concerns  and  to  work  together  toward  the  shared  goal  of  GMS  growth  and \ndevelopment. Through the technical coordination and facilitation of the WGA secretariat, the WGA \nwill  conduct  activities  to  implement  CASP  priority  projects  and  core  activities  including  WGA \nmeetings, dialogues, consultation workshops, publications, website enhancements, and studies of \npriority CASP areas. The RETA will provide opportunities for consultations with GMS countries, \ndevelopment partners, and other key stakeholders, as well as coordination with other GMS sector \nworking groups, especially on common issues.  \n16.  Project interventions are expected to improve agriculture and encourage socially inclusive \ndevelopment.  The  development  of  strategic  frameworks  for  components  3  and  4  will  raise \nawareness of the issues and concerns of ethnic minorities and indigenous people. The design will \nincorporate the selection criteria and identify extension, training, and capacity building needs for \nthese groups. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The cost of the RETA is estimated at $3.164 million equivalent. ADB will finance the \nequivalent of $1.50 million as a grant from ADB\u2019s TA funding program, and the equivalent of \n$500,000 will be financed as a grant by the Government of the PRC. GMS countries will contribute \nthe equivalent of $250,000 in-kind. The IFAD will finance $200,000, and FAO  will contribute \n$714,000. Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.

The Core Agriculture Support Program \n \n1.  The Core Agriculture Support Program (CASP) consists of a series of priority projects \ngrouped into broad subject areas (components) in the context of subregional cooperation in \nagriculture. The components seek to address issues and lead to accelerated and expanded \nsubregional  cooperation  and  enhanced  agricultural  growth  and  poverty  reduction  through \nincreased investments and cross-border agricultural trade. \n \n1.  Facilitating Cross-Border Agricultural Trade and Investment \n \n2.  Trade  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  countries  will  benefit  from  the \ncoordination and establishment of wholesale agriculture markets and distribution centers in \nborder  areas.  Likewise,  the  introduction  of  cross-border  agricultural  resource  and  market \ninformation  systems  will  open  up  opportunities  for  cross-border  cooperation  in  farming, \nprocessing, and value-added activities in agriculture. The Working Group on Agriculture (WGA) \ncan  facilitate  through  the  CASP  the  preparation  of  principal  guidelines  or  regulations  for \nconducting foreign direct investment linked to contract farming. Also, sanitary and phytosanitary \nregulations vary among GMS countries. Enhanced cooperation toward standardizing agricultural \nproduce  and  products  will  facilitate  agricultural  trade  among  GMS  countries.  The  priority \nprojects and subprojects of this component cover a range of cross-border and related issues, \nincluding regulatory systems and standards, demand and supply, contract farming, and food \nsafety.  \n \n2.  Promoting Public-Private Partnerships in Sharing Agricultural Information \n \n3.  Knowledge management, intellectual capital, and information and knowledge sharing are \nessential for agricultural development. Effective mechanisms need to be established to enhance \npublic-private partnership in the exchange of information for mutual benefit. This component will \nestablish information- and knowledge-sharing systems that will enhance the involvement of the \nprivate sector in sharing intellectual capital for agriculture. The centerpiece of this component is \nthe GMS Agricultural Information Network Service, a joint initiative of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Through this component, the WGA will \nwork  closely  with  the  Consultative  Group  on  International  Agricultural  Research  (CGIAR), \nCentre de coop\u00e9ration internationale en recherche agronomique pour le d\u00e9veloppement, and \nother specialized agencies that have had initiatives on agricultural knowledge management in \nthe subregion. Priority areas include improving farmers\u2019 livelihoods through postharvest and \ninformation technology and developing and enhancing knowledge-sharing systems to assist \nsectoral development, both in research and development and in agricultural extension services. \n \n3.  Enhancing Capacity in Agricultural Science and Technology \n \n4.  The  WGA  will  collaborate  with  initiatives  that  build  capability  for  agricultural \ncompetitiveness and facilitate capacity building in agricultural water resource management. It \nwill promote rural renewable energy sources, particularly the demonstration and extension of \nbiogas  and  biofuel  technology.  The  WGA  will  continue  to  support  advanced  science  and \ntechnology undertakings in biotechnology and biofuels to integrate available technologies, both \nold and new, into farming systems and enhance the associated value chains. This component \nwill explore linkages with specialized agencies, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization \n ", "                                                   Appendix 4         15 \n   \n(FAO) of the United Nations, on the provision of programs to build agricultural competitiveness \nin  the  subregion.  Through  regional  initiatives  in  research,  training,  and  extension,  this \ncomponent will encourage and mobilize resources for the development of existing institutions by \nstrengthening them to become centers of excellence or centers of development. The projects \ninvolve research, management, and/or training in such areas as renewable energy, agricultural \nextension, fisheries development, water and natural resources issues, sanitation aspects, trans-\nboundary animal diseases (TADs), and quarantine. \n \n4.  Establishing  Emergency  Response  Mechanisms  for  Agricultural  and \nNatural Resources Crises \n \n5.  Subregional cooperation in agriculture needs a collective response mechanism to cope \nwith agriculture-related emergencies, calamities, and natural disasters, as well as to address the \nspread of animal disease, floods, pest infestation, and forest fires, which can result in huge \neconomic losses in the GMS. Through this component, a disaster preparedness, mitigation, and \nemergency response system for agricultural crises, based on geographic information systems, \nwill improve the capability of the GMS countries to develop mitigation and coping strategies for \nsuch calamities. The WGA will coordinate with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, \nwhich sponsors a similar initiative among its member countries. \n \n5.  Strengthening Institutional Linkages and Mechanisms for Cooperation \n \n6.  Agricultural institutional linkages and mechanisms, operational systems, and protocols \nfor the WGA need to be developed with national coordinators, in line with the thrust of the \noverall GMS program to strengthen infrastructure linkages through a multisectoral approach. \nThe WGA Secretariat has been set up to assist in implementing priority projects. National \ncommittees and coordinating offices for the WGA will be strengthened. The component includes \npromoting partnerships in priority areas identified by the WGA, sharing best practices and \nresearch results, and the exchange of information with stakeholders in the private, public, and \nnongovernmental  sectors,  including  farmers,  as  well  as  with  development  partners  and \ninternational  centers  of  excellence.  The  component  will  provide  opportunities  for  extensive \ndialogue and forums for participatory planning, design, and knowledge dissemination. It will \ncreate communities of practice in the GMS countries for reducing rural poverty.  \n \nB.   Status of Core Agriculture Support Program  \n \n1.

Following endorsement of the CASP during the Agriculture \nMinisters\u2019  Meeting  in  Beijing  in  April  2007,  projects  under  the  CASP  were  prioritized  and \nidentified as short-, medium-, and long-term at the December 2007 WGA national coordinators\u2019 \nmeeting. A prioritization exercise was undertaken by the WGA to finalize the Vientiane Plan of \nAction for Agriculture. Under group 1, there are projects that are ongoing or for immediate \nimplementation with identified financing. These are Policy Support for Cross-Border Contract \nFarming, Improving Farmers\u2019 Livelihood through Postharvest Technology, Improving Farmers\u2019 \nLivelihood  through  Rice  Information  Technology,  Agriculture  Information  Network  Service \n(AINS), GMS Rural Renewable Energy Development Project, Trans-boundary Animal Disease \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2006.

Elaboration of Project Concepts. The GMS national consultants were engaged by \nADB to assist the GMS WGA in developing concept papers and proposals for funding for the \npriority projects in early 2008.  \n \nC.   Approach to Accelerate Implementation of CASP \n \n9.  Resource  Mobilization.  In  several  WGA  meetings\u2014WGA-4,11 Agriculture  Ministers\u2019 \nMeeting,12 and WGA-513\u2014a number of development partners, specifically FAO, International \nFund  for  Agricultural  Development  (IFAD),  Finland,  and  CGIAR,  expressed  interest  in \nparticipating in the implementation of the CASP through parallel and complimentary financing. \nAt present, the priority projects are being implemented through two RETA projects:  \n \n10.   RETA on Accelerating the Implementation of the CASP. Under the RETA, five key \nareas  will  be  implemented  in  support  of  the CASP  components:  (i)  implementation  of  the \nstrategy for biotechnology and biosafety initiated, (ii) agriculture information and network service \ndevelopment and use promoted, (iii) rural renewable energy development strategy supported, \n(iv)  food  security  and  cross-border  agriculture  trade  strategies  developed,  and  (v)  WGA \nSecretariat  strengthened.  The  objectives  of  the  CASP  supported  by  the  RETA  are  to  (i) \naccelerate and strengthen subregional cooperation in agriculture, (ii) contribute to food security \nand poverty reduction in the subregion, (iii) facilitate cross-border trade and investment in \nagriculture, (iv) facilitate the transfer and adoption of improved agricultural technologies, and (iv) \ndevelop human resources and competencies to address cross-border concerns.  \n \n11.

RETA 6390 is ongoing RETA that commenced in March 2007 and aims to \ncontribute to the larger goal of reducing poverty in poor livestock-raising communities in the \nGMS through better control of TADs, increased production of safer food, and enhanced access \nfor smallholders to higher-value markets for their livestock and livestock products. It builds on \nthe achievements of RETA 6192: Control of Trans-boundary Animal Diseases in the GMS \n(Phase I). RETA 6192 aimed to develop a regional cooperation framework, upgrade regional \nand national laboratories, and strengthen staff capacity in participating countries to control TADs. \nThe RETA was able to conduct (i) socioeconomic surveys on the impacts of diseases on the \nlivelihoods of poor farming communities, which was undertaken in the Upper and Lower Mekong \nDisease Control zones; (ii) the training of staff from participating countries in diagnostics and the \n                                                 \n11  Held on 6\u20138 December 2006 in Siem Reap, Cambodia. \n12  Held on 9\u201311 April 2007 in Beijing. \n13  Held on 22\u201324 September 2008 in Vientiane, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \n14 ADB. 2007.

The specific \nCASP objective supported by this RETA is ensuring the surveillance and control of TADs to \nmitigate social and economic impacts. \n \nD.  Framework for Implementation  \n \n12.  The proposed RETA for accelerating the implementation of CASP will initially support \nfour main areas: (i) enhancing capacity in agriculture science and technology; (ii) promoting \npublic-private  partnership  in  sharing  agricultural  information;  (iii)  facilitating  cross-border \nagricultural trade and investment; and (iv) strengthening institutional linkages and mechanisms \nfor cooperation. It will be implemented in partnership with key development partners, WGA \nnational coordinators, and selected centers of excellence (Figure A4.1). The complementary \nRETA 6390 will support activities under establishing Emergency Response Mechanisms for \nAgriculture and Natural Resource (ANR) Crises. \n \n \n \n13.  Responsibilities of Partners. The Agriculture, Environment, and Natural Resources \nDivision of the Southeast Asia Department of ADB will be the Executing Agency for the RETA \nthrough the WGA Secretariat. The WGA Secretariat will be responsible for coordinating RETA \nactivities  and  providing  technical  and  administrative  support  under  the  supervision  of  the \ndesignated ADB project officer. The WGA Secretariat will serve as the management unit for the \nRETA  and  oversee  the  implementation  of  activities.  The  FAO,  IFAD,  Foreign  Economic \n ", "18  Appendix 4            \n   \nCooperation Center (FECC) of the PRC Ministry of Agriculture, and WGA National Secretariats \nin  the  GMS  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  RETA.  The  FAO  will  implement \ncomponents  1  and  3  by  conducting  relevant  studies  and  organizing  policy  forums  and/or \nworkshops. The National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA) will provide \nexpertise for component 1 in (i) regional training and workshop facilities, (ii) establishing an \ninformation website, (iii) sharing and coordinating information with AINS, (iv) developing a web-\nbased  platform  for  sharing  and  updating  information  in  the  GMS  and  utilizing  baseline \ninformation  collected  through  RETA  6214,  and  (v)  establishing  an  information  gateway. \nComponent 2 will be implemented by FECC in collaboration with the GMS countries. The FECC \nwill organize coordination and planning workshops, training programs, and short-term studies to \npopulate the AINS database. The IFAD will conduct further assessment studies and modeling \non biofuels and rural renewable energy in the PRC under component 3 and cooperate with the \nWGA and ADB on component 4. Activities under Components 1 and 4 will be complemented by \nthe capacity building and research programs of ADBI. The WGA Secretariat and FAO will lead \nthe implementation of the component 4 by conducting relevant studies and organizing policy \nforums and/or workshops.
