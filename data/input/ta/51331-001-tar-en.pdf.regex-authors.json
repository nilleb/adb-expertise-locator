INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) aims to support the deepening of \nknowledge sharing between developing countries through the Regional Knowledge Sharing \nInitiative (RKSI), specifically in sharing development-related knowledge between developing \nmember countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and drawing on the experience \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in promoting and supporting rapid economic growth over \nthe past 30 years. \n \n2.  The TA will support the identification, development, and sharing of knowledge solutions in \nDMCs,  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  and  country  partnership \nstrategies for participating DMCs.1 RKSI will implement this TA in collaboration with partner \ninstitutions in the PRC and other DMCs, with ADB as knowledge intermediary. The TA is not \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plans for participating DMCs.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Asia  and  the  Pacific  has  achieved  significant  economic  success  in  recent  years, \naccounting for more than half of global economic growth. However, more than 300 million people \nin the region live in absolute poverty. To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals in 2030 and \neliminate absolute poverty, consistent progress in sustainable and inclusive growth is required. \nSharing quality and practical development knowledge plays a vital role in formulating effective \npolicies toward attaining these goals. \n \n4.  The PRC has achieved an annual average growth rate of almost 10% in the past 30 years. \nThis sustained economic growth helped lift more than 800 million of its citizens out of poverty and \nkept the PRC on track to eliminate absolute poverty by 2020, as defined by its national poverty \nthreshold. Over the course of its development, the PRC experienced one of the most rapid \nurbanization paces in history. The share of urban residents in the PRC doubled from 25.3% in \n1987 to more than 50.0% of its population in 2012, an increase of more than 20 million urban \nresidents every year.3 The PRC\u2019s population, however, is aging at a faster rate than in other \ncountries. \n \n5.  Within the PRC, adaption to rapid changes in economic conditions and transformation \nresulted in a variety of policy responses that were piloted at local levels. These decentralized \nexperiments were then fed into the formulation of national policies. The PRC\u2019s development \nexperience thus constitutes a diverse set of policy experiments and lessons that can be shared \nwith other DMCs. \n \n6.  The number of institutions in the region and in the PRC that work on various development \nissues has been growing in recent years, and some are becoming internationally competitive and \nwell regarded. However, not all knowledge produced is readily accessible to DMC counterparts \noutside the PRC. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 February 2018. \n3  The PRC\u2019s current urbanization policy would further increase the percentage of urban residents to 60% of the total \npopulation by 2020. \n ", "2 \n7.  ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 highlighted knowledge solutions as one of the five development \ndrivers in Asia and the Pacific. Many ADB country partnership strategies for DMCs also include \nknowledge solutions. As these DMCs develop into middle-income economies and beyond, the \nPRC\u2019s experience in navigating and transcending the challenges of middle-income traps would \nbe constructive and relevant, especially as the PRC is expected to grow into the world\u2019s largest \neconomy within the next decade. \n \n8.  To promote cooperation between DMCs, the Government of the PRC and ADB launched \nRKSI on 30 August 2012 with the mandate to foster knowledge sharing. This was intended to \nincrease collaboration between DMCs and promote regional cooperation and integration. RKSI \nprovides  a  platform  for  knowledge  exchange  between  ADB\u2019s  DMCs,  promotes  regional \nknowledge-sharing  events  that  build  on  knowledge  partnerships,  and  aims  to  improve \ncoordination and serve as a catalyst for bilateral and multilateral knowledge sharing. \n \n9.  The implementation of the TA through RKSI enables the sharing of best practices and \nlessons from development programs and projects, including from ADB\u2019s operations. This helps \nimprove  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  government  and  international  assistance.  The \nmultiplier effect increases through the online knowledge dissemination of best practices and policy \nlessons. RKSI will support themes under this TA that align with the current priorities of ADB\u2019s \nstrategic  focus,  such  as  (i)  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive  growth,  (ii)  urban  and  social \ndevelopment, (iii) environment and climate change, (iv) regional cooperation and integration, and \n(v) high technology and innovation. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) regional cooperation and sustained \nknowledge sharing between the PRC and other DMCs has been enhanced; and (ii) the quality of \ndevelopment policies implemented in the PRC and other DMCs has improved. The TA will have \nthe following outcome: the capacity of key institutions and knowledge networks in the PRC and \nother DMCs to address emerging development issues has been strengthened.4 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: Awareness of the PRC and other DMCs on emerging development issues \nenhanced. The TA\u2019s main vehicles for improving awareness of emerging development issues are \nknowledge-sharing events.  ADB will organize and support demand-based workshops, seminars, \ntraining, conferences, forums, study tours, and other events with partner institutions; and will help \nDMC participants increase their understanding of development issues and policy implications. \nADB will share and discuss experiences, lessons, and best practices from the PRC and other \ncountries. It will disseminate presentations, videos, and multimedia products related to the events \nthrough the RKSI website and other multimedia channels. ADB will also conduct surveys to \ncapture client demand and post-event evaluations to ensure the effectiveness of knowledge \nsharing. The TA will primarily provide support for resource persons and international participants. \n \n12.  Output  2:  Knowledge  products  produced  and  disseminated.  Knowledge-sharing \nevents will generate knowledge products, including workshop papers, case studies, conference \nproceedings  or  other  publications,  and  multilingual  video  clips.  The  TA  will  support  the \n                                                \n4  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \ndevelopment, production, translation, and dissemination of high-quality knowledge products to \nhighlight selected knowledge solutions and to ensure broad access to participants from different \nDMCs. ADB will publish at least eight knowledge products under the TA. ADB and a knowledge \npartner will jointly determine the ultimate method of dissemination, whether in print or in electronic \nformat. The TA will also foster a thematic approach to producing knowledge products with ADB \npartners. \n \n13.  Output 3: Knowledge networks strengthened and expanded. The TA will leverage \nADB-supported subregional networks such as the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \nand Greater Mekong Subregion programs. Building on past and ongoing cooperation between \nADB and the PRC, the TA will further develop triangular cooperation and focus on knowledge \nsharing between DMCs, with ADB playing an intermediary role.5 To better share the PRC\u2019s \ndevelopment experience, ADB will select eminent knowledge institutions and research think tanks \nin the PRC and within the region to initiate new partnerships and further expand the knowledge \nnetworks through memorandums of understanding or knowledge partnership agreements. \n \n14.  Output 4: RKSI website enhanced as a platform for knowledge sharing. The RKSI \nwebsite is a depository of knowledge products from RKSI events and knowledge products related \nto collaboration between DMCs. Under the TA, ADB will enhance the RKSI website and increase \nits  interactive  elements  to  allow  for  broad-based  interaction  with  knowledge  partners  and \nstakeholders. ADB will upload and disseminate all events and knowledge products through the \nRKSI website on a timely basis. ADB will also improve the user-friendliness of the website by \ncreating online knowledge modules, and further explore the use of multimedia and newsletters to \nenhance the online dissemination of knowledge. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $937,500, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the People\u2019s Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund6 and \nadministered by ADB. Knowledge sharing events and services will leverage other ADB events \nand resources. Participating DMCs will provide in-kind contributions for various counterpart \nactivities and support for joint knowledge-sharing activities. The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will administer the TA, with the Office of the Director General at the East Asia \nDepartment (EARD) as the focal point. EARD will assign ADB staff to manage RKSI. EARD, \nthrough RKSI, will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; organize workshops; and provide \nstaff to act as resource persons in the workshops. In consultation with the PRC government, RKSI \nwill work with other ADB departments and external knowledge partners to finalize the knowledge \npartnerships and activities under the TA. RKSI will implement the TA between 1 July 2018 and \n1 July 2020. EARD, through RKSI, will discuss TA implementation and monitoring with the PRC\u2019s \nMinistry of Finance and update the People\u2019s Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional \nCooperation Fund from time to time, as required. \n \n                                                \n5  To date, RKSI has successfully supported the PRC and its partners in the funding and implementation of 12 flagship \nknowledge-sharing events, co-sponsorship of 27 knowledge events, and publication of 8 knowledge products and \n67 video clips, reaching more than 3,500 participants. \n6  The fund was originally named \u201cPeople\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund\u201d in \nthe 2005 Board paper. \n ", "4 \n17.

Consulting services. ADB will engage consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or \nstaff instructions.7 ADB will engage individual international consultants for 10 person-months and \nindividual national consultants for 70 person-months for the knowledge-sharing activities to be \nfunded under the TA. ADB will engage the individual consultants rather than firms since there will \nbe multiple partnerships with different institutions under the TA,  covering various forms of \nknowledge collaboration with differing consultancy needs; most of these activities and required \ninputs cannot yet be identified at the time of TA processing, prior to consultations with knowledge \npartners. The TA will also finance regional knowledge-sharing activities, including resource \npersons, participants, and the preparation and finalization of knowledge products. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the Asian \nDevelopment Bank administering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 \nto be financed on a grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional \nCooperation Fund for Enhancing Regional Knowledge Sharing Partnerships, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n                                                \n7  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the TA is Aligned with \nRegional cooperation and sustained knowledge sharing between the PRC and other DMCs enhanced \n(project-defined) \nQuality of development policies implemented in the PRC and other DMCs improved (project-defined) \n \n \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2021     \nCapacity of key  a.
