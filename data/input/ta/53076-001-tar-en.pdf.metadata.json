INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help improve institutional \ncapacity and service delivery for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and in sectors and economies \nwhere SOEs are prominent. In response to Asian Development Bank (ADB) developing member \ncountry (DMC) demand, the TA will be coordinated with ADB operations departments and develop \nSOE diagnostics, SOE knowledge and tools, and institutional capacity for SOE oversight and \nreform.  \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with ADB Strategy 2030 and the draft operational plan for operational \npriority 6 on strengthening governance and institutional capacity in DMCs.1 It builds on the \nmeetings and findings of the SOE Working Group, which included high level representation from \nacross ADB and whose acting secretariat is the Governance Thematic Group (SDTC-GOV) of the \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDCC). ADB is launching the TA to \nsupport its operational work with SOEs and implement ADB Strategy 2030, which emphasizes \nSOE reforms and internal governance to improve access to capital and service delivery. The TA \nis included in SDCC\u2019s 2019 results-based work plan.2 \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  SOEs have long played an important role in economic development in Asia and the Pacific. \nEspecially prominent in energy, transportation, and finance, SOEs also include major enterprises \nin mining, manufacturing, food distribution, and other industries. Their share of gross domestic \nproduct in Asian economies generally ranges from an estimated 20%\u201340%. Beyond their impact \non service delivery and productivity in key industries, SOEs can be an important source of both \ngovernment revenues and liabilities.3 SOE governance and performance can ultimately influence \nthe achievement of several sustainable development goals.4 \n  \n4.  Governments sometimes created SOEs in areas like natural monopolies, where they felt \nthe government should retain control. In many cases, governments used SOEs to launch new \nindustries or expand existing ones, even when, historically, the private sector had developed \nthese industries in more advanced economies. Across Asia and the Pacific, SOEs still play a \nprominent role in operating and expanding much needed infrastructure.  \n \n5.  Unfortunately, in too many Asian and Pacific economies, poorly performing SOE sectors \neffectively hinder sustainable development. Several years of reform have not addressed the \ncauses of this core problem: vulnerability to political interference and corruption; an unlevel \nplaying field with the private sector; and reduced SOE productivity due to soft budget constraints, \npoor internal and sector governance, and, crucially, little or no real accountability combined with \nmultiple and conflicting objectives. In addition, SOEs may have hidden and contingent liabilities \nfor the national budget.   \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018.

Underlying these challenges are the root failures of SOE oversight and governance: \nsystematic opacity and a deep resistance to useful disclosure; poorly designed and unfunded \npolicy  mandates;  and  legal  and  regulatory  regimes  that  are  ambiguous,  incomplete,  and \nunnecessarily distinct from the private sector. Most importantly, no part of the government has \nreal responsibility for SOE performance or is held accountable for it. The nature of SOEs \nthemselves, the quality of management, and how the state acts as owner of assets drive these \nunderlying causes and the resulting negative effects.5 These challenges are compounded by the \npolitically sensitive nature of SOEs and potential reforms.  \n  \n7.  ADB has long worked to address these challenges in its engagements with SOEs. ADB \nStrategy 2030 and the forthcoming operational plan on strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity emphasize that this engagement should continue and become more effective.6 \n \n8.  However, according to a 2018 Independent Evaluation report, supported reforms tended \nto be piecemeal and few addressed how the state acts as an owner of assets and who carries \nout that role(s) in the state administration.7 The Management response to the report supported \nthe recommendations for ADB to strengthen operations dealing with SOE reforms.8  \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s approach to SOE reform is consistent with international experience. For decades, \ncountries around the world made repeated reforms to SOEs. In most countries, these reforms did \nnot sufficiently address root causes and their results were often disappointing. With only partial \nreforms, countries still experienced limited private sector development; poor delivery of and \nlimited investments in energy, transportation, finance, and other key areas; adverse budgetary \nimpacts; and heightened vulnerability to economic shocks.  \n \n10.  After 2000, a growing number of countries focused reforms on how the state carried out \nits ownership functions. The exercise of these functions was often centralized, sometimes under \nthe ministry of finance or industry, but increasingly in specialized holding companies or equivalent \nentities. In many instances, these reforms led to greater market contestability as barriers to entry \nwere  reduced  and  competition  led  to  the  dismantling  or  significant  downsizing  of  SOEs, \nparticularly in manufacturing and services. More broadly, these reforms increased commercial \norientation, expected returns on capital and investment, transparency, and improved high-level \ndecision-making, board appointment, and other aspects of corporate governance. Countries often \npursued these reforms in conjunction with wider reforms to SOE performance management, \nsector governance,  subsidies,  public  service  obligations,  and  public financial  management. \nEfforts to ensure a level playing field with the private sector often become more effective, as did \nongoing corporatization, restructuring, and privatization.9 \n \n11.  Some economies in Asia and the Pacific led these reforms, which have now spread to \nothers. When SOE governance is more advanced, substantial scope typically remains for further \nimprovement to help access capital markets, increase infrastructure finance and service delivery, \nand  improve  reporting on  and  increased  consideration  of  wider  environmental,  social,  and \ngovernance issues. \n                                                \n5  Robinett, D. 2006.

The TA is aligned with the following impact: service delivery by SOEs strengthened.10 The TA will \nhave the following outcome: improvement of SOE governance and oversight in selected DMCs \nsupported.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n13.  The TA will help implement ADB Strategy 2030\u2019s call for better SOE governance and other \nSOE reform. It will build on international standards and good practice as well as the ADB\u2019s own \nextensive experience with SOEs. The ultimate goal of SOE reforms would be better service \ndelivery and improved operational efficiency. The TA will focus on DMCs with the will for SOE \nreform and coordinate closely with ADB operations departments. The TA will provide knowledge, \nknowledge-sharing, and tools grounded in the realities and opportunities for SOE reform in Asia \nand the Pacific. It will begin a series of focused diagnostics to identify and correct the root causes \nof SOE failure. In conjunction with ADB operations and the knowledge building and diagnostic \ncomponents, the TA will support focused institutional capacity development.  \n \n14.  Specific areas of focus for SOE diagnostics and knowledge and institutional capacity \ndevelopment  will  include  fiscal  linkages,  sector  governance  and  competition,  and  internal \ngovernance and transparency. Crucially, this TA will seek to better understand and improve how \nDMCs measure SOE performance, hold SOEs accountable for that performance, and make other \nmajor decisions in SOEs. Findings from this work will feed into country partnership strategies and \noperational work.  \n \n15.  The TA will also improve SOE performance by supporting corporatization, equitization, \nshedding non-core assets, and appropriate private sector engagement. These reforms can help \ntransition an SOE to direct and non-sovereign borrowing, and ultimately, on the strength of its \nbalance sheet, to the financial markets, but this transition also depends on strong government \nownership of the reforms, on the governance of the SOE, its economic fundamentals, and the \nmarket(s) it is operating in. The main outputs of the TA are listed below.12 \n \n16.  Output 1: State-owned enterprise diagnostics prepared. The TA will support national, \nsector, and enterprise level diagnostics that will benchmark SOE governance and oversight \nagainst well-established international standards, including those issued by the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development and the World Bank.13 The goal will be to find major \ngaps and risk areas and develop appropriate solutions. The TA will conduct diagnostics in at least \ntwo DMCs based on operational priorities and the input of the SOE Working Group. Their findings \nwill inform tools developed under output 2 and feed into capacity development under output 3.  \n   \n                                                \n10 Footnote 1. \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n12  Based on consultations with operations departments and DMCs, activities under the TA include: (i) a diagnostic and \nrelated capacity development on corporate governance implementation in the 50 largest SOEs in Uzbekistan; (ii) \ncapacity development under a road map for SOE reform that is currently being drafted in Maldives; (iii) policy \ndevelopment to better insure port assets against natural disasters in Samoa, in coordination with an ADB port project; \nand (iv) a governance brief and case studies for use in DMCs and ADB to help increase understanding of best \napproaches to SOE reform. \n13 OECD. 2015.

Output 2: State-owned enterprise knowledge and tools developed. The TA will help \npublish policy-relevant guidance on SOE reform. The TA will also support the participation of \ngovernment officials who oversee SOEs and SOE leadership in relevant regional and international \nevents, including as part of their engagement with ADB operational work and under output 3. In \naddition, the TA will develop diagnostic tools, case studies, and other relevant training materials \nfor outputs 1 and 3. The TA will support an overview of SOE governance and related challenges \nin Asia and the Pacific. \n \n18.  Output 3: Capacity development for state-owned enterprise oversight and reform \nsupported. The TA will provide guidance on relevant policy and regulation and help train those \nin ownership and oversight entities and in leadership and vigilance positions in SOEs. This \ncapacity development will build on international good practice, and when possible build on \ndiagnostics. The TA will help develop capacity in at least three DMCs, in close coordination with \nADB operations departments. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  ADB will administer the TA with SDTC-GOV as the executing and implementing agency. \nSDTC-GOV will report to the SOE Working Group on TA progress and consult with relevant sector \nand  thematic  groups  during  implementation.  It  will  work  and  coordinate  with  operations \ndepartments to seek concurrence from selected DMCs for country-level activities. It will select, \nsupervise, and evaluate consultants, organize workshops, and provide staff to act as resource \npersons in workshops.  \n \n21.
