THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support \n(CARES) Program, under the Countercyclical Support Facility\u2013COVID-19 pandemic response \noption.1 \n \n2.  Tajikistan is experiencing significant adverse economic and social impacts from the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, and a rapid increase in domestic cases and deaths. \nPreventative measures and external factors are causing economic growth to decelerate sharply, \nand unemployment and poverty to increase. To mitigate these impacts and protect the fragile \nhealth  system,  the  government  adopted  urgent  pro-poor  countercyclical  measures  and \nexpenditures, including (i) a health sector and social protection response package to assist poor \nand vulnerable groups, and (ii) measures to ensure food security and support to businesses prone \nto experiencing severe effects. The proposed Asian Development Bank (ADB) program will, in \nthe short term, support the government\u2019s COVID-19 countercyclical responses and financing \nneeds, to help mitigate the adverse health, social, and economic impacts of the crisis, while \ntargeting poor and vulnerable groups and ensuring gender mainstreaming.2 It will complement \ncooperation efforts to contain the pandemic in the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \n(CAREC)  region.  The  program,  to  be  implemented  during  2020,  was  developed  in  close \ncoordination with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and supports fiscal sustainability in the \nmedium term as well as economic recovery. \n \n3.  Tajikistan meets all six access criteria of ADB\u2019s COVID-19 pandemic response option \nunder the Countercyclical Support Facility (Table 1 and Appendix 3).  \n \nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria for COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \nEligibility Criteria  ADB Assessment \n1. Adverse impact  The COVID-19 pandemic is causing significant socioeconomic shock to Tajikistan. \nof exogenous  From 30 April to 31 May 2020, the country reported 3,930 positive COVID-19 cases \nshock  and 47 deaths. The IMF forecasts a recession in 2020, with GDP growth of \u20132%. \nRevenue shortfalls of 15% will expand the fiscal deficit to 7.7% of GDP, and the \ncurrency was devalued by 5%. Key transmission mechanisms include a sharp \nreduction in remittances, international trade, and foreign direct investment; and \nslowdowns in the transport, tourism, retail, and finance industries. The health \nsector is not sufficiently equipped to respond to a large-scale health crisis, and \nunemployment and poverty are expected to rise. \n \n2. Countercyclical  The government prepared a countercyclical package for COVID-19 response \ndevelopment  measures under the Tajikistan COVID-19 Country Preparedness and Response \nexpenditure  Plan, approved on 19 March 2020: (i) increased targeted social assistance for poor \nand vulnerable groups, (ii) health sector response measures to combat COVID-19, \n(iii) food security measures, and (iv) measures to support MSMEs and to safeguard \nemployment. Estimated cost of the package is $364 million. \n \n3. Pre-shock  Pre-shock GDP growth was strong, averaging 7.1% over 2016\u20132019 and leading \nrecord of generally  to poverty reduction. The fiscal deficit increased in 2017 to 6.0% of GDP as the \nsound  government stepped up borrowing but narrowed to 2.8% in 2018 and 2.1% in 2019. \n \n1  ADB. 2020. Policy Paper: ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Manila. \n2  ADB received a formal request from the President of Tajikistan for budget support to respond to the pandemic \nemergency on 16 March 2020. An initial draft of the design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1, and the list \nof linked documents is in Appendix 2. Transaction technical assistance will not be provided for program preparation.  ", "2 \nEligibility Criteria  ADB Assessment \nmacroeconomic  Before the shock, the government had reduced total public debt from 50% in 2017 \nmanagement  to 45% of GDP in 2019 and aimed to maintain strong growth and a stable budget \ndeficit in 2020. The government was implementing structural reforms pre-shock \nsupported by development partners to improve macro-fiscal management. Inflation \nhad been dampened by improved monetary operations and remained \u0430ithin NBT\u2019s \ntarget range of 6% (+/\u2013 2%).  \n \n4. Structural  The  government  implemented  rapid  COVID-19  responses  such  as  travel \nreforms (health  restrictions, set  up a  task force for interministerial  and development  partner \nsector response)  coordination, and requested development assistance (main text, Table 2). The \nproposed program supports the government\u2019s countercyclical and health response \nmeasures to prevent, prepare for, and combat the spread of COVID-19. This \nincludes expanding the capacity of the health sector, increasing the salaries of \nhealth workers, and obtaining additional medical supplies and personal protective \nequipment. \n \n5. Debt  Pre-shock, the IMF had assessed Tajikistan to be at high risk of debt distress. The \nsustainability  updated ADB debt sustainability analysis projects that public debt will increase \nfrom 45.4% of GDP in 2019 to 47.6% of GDP in 2020 in the base scenario, from \nadditional concessional borrowing, and will stabilize in the medium term. The \nproposed $50 million ADB grant will create fiscal space and help improve debt \nsustainability. Expected financing from other international financial institutions in \n2020 is on concessional terms and will not significantly affect debt sustainability, \nand  the  IMF  has  granted  debt  relief  of  $28.49  million.  To  improve  debt \nsustainability, the government committed to (i) avoid nonconcessional external \nborrowing, (ii) pursue medium-term fiscal consolidation including reprioritization of \npublic spending, and (iii) strengthen public debt management.  \n \n6. IMF  ADB maintained close and strong coordination and collaboration with IMF staff in \ncoordination  Tajikistan  and  at  headquarters  to  prepare  the  program,  including  frequent \ndiscussions and information sharing on the impact of the crisis and the response. \nOn 6 May 2020, IMF approved a rapid credit facility for Tajikistan of $189.5 million \nand issued an updated macro-fiscal assessment to reflect the change in the macro-\nfiscal environment. The IMF supports the ADB program. \nADB = Asian Development Bank; COVID-19 = coronavirus disease; GDP = gross domestic product; IMF = International \nMonetary Fund; MSMEs = micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises; NBT = National Bank of Tajikistan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n4.  COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 rapidly accelerated into a global pandemic, as declared \nby the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020.  The number of cases grew \nexponentially across countries and continents, resulting in closed borders, travel restrictions, \nlockdowns, and national health crises. Tajikistan confirmed its first 15 cases of COVID-19 on \n30 April 2020, and by 31 May 2020, that number had risen to 3,930. It also confirmed 47 deaths.3 \nThe country has a fragile health system, which is facing increasing pressure and remains highly \nvulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Limited testing capacity, and absence of strict social \ndistancing and self-isolation measures has given rise to the rapid growth of cases.4 Only 7,700 \ntests were completed in Tajikistan up to 12 May 2020, indicating a high probability of undetected \n \n3 Ministry of Health and Social Protection's daily reports. http://moh.tj/ (accessed 1 June 2020). \n4 Tajikistan\u2019s technology infrastructure and employment profile are not well suited to work-from-home measures. \n ", "3 \ncases. The government implemented rapid measures at the start of the global outbreak to prevent \nthe spread of the virus and protect the health system (Table 2).  \n \nTable 2: Summary of Government Measures to Control the COVID-19 Pandemic \nMeasure  Description \nTravel restrictions  Border with the PRC closed in January 2020, and citizens from five high-risk \ncountries prohibited from entering Tajikistan from February 2020. All flights \nsuspended and airports closed from 20 March 2020. \nQuarantine  More than 12,500 people quarantined, including those arriving from \noverseas as of 5 May 2020 (World Health Organization statistics update). \nMedical supplies  Government received 46,000 test kits and medical supplies, largely from the \nand test kits  PRC, the Russian Federation, and Germany from February to May 2020. \nTask force  Task force established, chaired by the Prime Minister, to determine \nmeasures to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic and address its impacts. \nPreparedness plan   Government approved the Tajikistan COVID-19 Country Preparedness and \nResponse Plan on 19 March 2020. \nSocial distancing  In March 2020, sports, cultural events, and some businesses closed, \nincluding hotels, theaters, and travel companies (suspension of business \nactivity). Meetings and gatherings cancelled. In April 2020, Dushanbe City \ncelebrations cancelled and mosques closed; and nonfood markets and \nschools closed from 27 April 2020. Wearing of masks made compulsory \nfrom 30 April 2020. On 5 May 2020, summer vacation declared for schools \nand universities (until 17 August 2020). \nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n5.  Pre-shock record of generally sound macroeconomic management. Gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth averaged 7.1% during 2016\u20132019, driven mainly by remittance-funded \nconsumption,  service  sector  growth,  high  public  investment,  and  state  led  industrialization, \ndespite low private investment. The fiscal deficit spiked in 2017 to 6.0% of GDP as the government \nincreased borrowing to fund the recapitalization of two state-owned banks left insolvent by the \n2015 financial crisis, and boosted capital expenditure for the Rogun Hydropower Project.5 \nSubsequently the government was able to bring the fiscal deficit under control, which narrowed \nto 2.8% of GDP in 2018 and 2.1% in 2019, partly because expenditure on the Rogun Project was \ncontained. Before the COVID-19 shock, the fiscal deficit was projected to rise to 5.2% of GDP in \n2020 and then stabilize to an average 4% in 2021\u20132022. The growth rate rose from 7.3% in 2018 \nto 7.5% in 2019, and public debt was on a downward trend from a peak of 50.4% of GDP in 2017 \nto 44.6% in 2019. The current account deficit also narrowed from 5.0% of GDP in 2018 to 2.3% \nin 2019, but was on course to increase to 5.2% in 2020.6 The ratio of tax to GDP remained rather \nhigh at an average 21% of GDP during 2017\u20132019.7 Inflation was dampened by improved \nmonetary operations and stayed within the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) target range of 6% \n(+/\u20132%), although exchange rate policy remained restrictive. The government also took positive \nsteps to improve the supervision and regulation of banks. Nonperforming loans fell from 47.6% in \n2016 to 26.1% in 2019, and profitability had improved since 2015, although two large state-owned \n \n5  The Rogun hydropower plant has a planned capacity of 3,600 megawatts and an estimated cost of $4.9 billion \n(exceeding 50% of GDP). Construction is ongoing and has accelerated since improved relations with Uzbekistan in \n2018. The government views the project as critical to resolving Tajikistan\u2019s \u0430inter electricit\u0432 deficit and establishing \nthe country as a regional energy supplier. The launch of the first two of six units (in November 2018 and September \n2019) boosted Tajikistan\u2019s electricit\u0432 e\u0431ports to Afghanistan and Uzbekistan.   \n6  IMF. 2020.

Overall,  Tajikistan\u2019s  record  of \nmacroeconomic management was generally sound and had been improving before the shock.  \n \n6.  Economic impact. COVID-19 significantly weakens Tajikistan's economy as prevention \nmeasures and external factors slow domestic consumption and the output of firms, including \nMSMEs. The main economic transmission mechanisms are a sharp reduction in remittances, \ninternational trade, and foreign direct investment; and slowdowns in the transport, tourism, retail, \nand finance industries. Tajikistan is vulnerable to external shocks, as experienced during the 2015 \nplunge in oil prices, when falling remittances and exchange rate depreciation triggered a long-\nlasting financial crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic will lead to a recession in the Middle East and \nCentral Asia region, with negative growth of \u20132.8% forecast for 2020.9 Consequently, Tajikistan's \neconomic growth is expected to decelerate sharply from 7.5% of GDP in 2019 to \u20132% in 2020 \nbased on IMF estimates (Figure), as a direct result of COVID-19. The IMF previously forecasted \nthat growth would slow down to 4.8% of GDP in 2020. The sharpest contraction is expected in \nthe service industry, which contributes 50% of GDP and employs about 28% of the workforce. \n \n7.  Remittances. Tajikistan is heavily dependent on remittance income, 95% of which comes \nfrom about 1 million migrant workers in the Russian Federation.10 The rapid fall in oil prices in the \nfirst quarter of 2020 and the negative impact of COVID-19 on the Russian economy left an \nestimated 500,000 migrant workers (5.2% of Tajikistan's population) unable to return to work at \nthe start of the 2020 migrant work season. Migrant workers still abroad (about 500,000) faced job \nlosses or were isolated abroad. The depreciation of the ruble against the somoni by 18% in the \nfirst quarter of 2020 also lowered the value of remittances received. Consequently, remittances \nare expected to fall by at least 35% in 2020 (Figure), equivalent to about $1 billion. This will have \na significant social impact since more than 50% of households (about 735,000) rely primarily on \nremittances for the consumption of food and basic necessities and are mostly located in the \npoorest regions and districts of the country.11  \n \nFigure: COVID-19 Impact on Tajikistan's Growth and Remittances (% of GDP) \nGDP Growth (%) Remittances (% of GDP)\n10\n60\n5 40\n20\n0\n2017 2018 2019 2020 (proj)2021 (proj)\n0\n-5 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\npre-COVID-19 post COVID-19 pre-COVID-19 post COVID-19 (proj)\n   \nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, GDP = gross domestic product, proj = projected. \nSources: International Monetary Fund, National Bank of Tajikistan, and Asian Development Bank. \n \n8  NBT. 2020.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to economic uncertainty, a drop \nin  commodity  prices,  disruption  to  trade  and  supply  chains,  and  lower  tourism  income.  It \nsignificantly reduced foreign investment flows to Tajikistan from the People\u2019s Republic of China \nand the Russian Federation. The value of exports fell 16.1% in the first quarter as trade slowed \nwith  neighboring  countries,  \u0430hich  receive  38%  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  total  e\u0431ports. 12  Domestic \nbusinesses  that  rely  on  imported  raw  materials  and  intermediate  goods  are  facing  supply \nconstraints; this is particularly apparent for MSMEs, although they account for a small share of \ntotal trade. Falling exports and remittances will widen the current account deficit in 2020 from \n5.2% to 7.7% of GDP (footnote 9), and are putting downward pressure on the somoni exchange \nrate and international reserves (equal to $1.47 billion or 5.3 months of imports as of year-end \n2019). In March 2020, the somoni was devalued by 5%, increasing the prices of imported food \nitems. Headline inflation averaged 10.6% by the end of April 2020 (up from 8.3% in the same \nperiod in 2019), \u0430hich is above the NBT\u2019s target range.  \n \n9.  Health sector. Tajikistan's fragile health sector is ill-prepared to deal with a large-scale \nhealth crisis such as COVID-19 and the accompanying surge in demand for medical services, as \nindicated by its ranking of 130th out of 195 counties in the Global Health Security Index.13 The \nsector has insufficient resources, and government spending on health is low at 7.0% of general \ngovernment spending, compared with 12.0% in the Kyrgyz Republic and a regional average of \n16.0%.14 Out-of-pocket spending accounts for 60% of combined health expenditure, and total \nhealth expenditure (public and private) per capita is the lowest in the region at $170.15 Tajikistan \nhealth sector capacity is limited, physical health infrastructure is inadequate, and there is a lack \nof trained medical personnel to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Its ratio of 20.9 doctors per \n10,000 people is below the Central Asia average of 34 doctors per 10,000 people.16 The supply \nand productive capacity for personal protective equipment in the country\u2014such as masks, gloves, \noveralls, disinfectants\u2014is insufficient to meet demand. In terms of intensive care units, the total \ncapacity for treating the most severely ill patients with ventilators was estimated to be only 510 at \nthe start of the outbreak. Only one laboratory in the country fully meets international standards for \ntesting, and there is a lack of qualified technicians to analyze coronavirus tests. Limited test kits \nare available and are being used only for patients showing symptoms (46,000 test kits have been \nreceived as of May 2020, and their quality and accuracy have given rise to concerns). \n \n10.  Poverty impact of COVID-19. Tajikistan remains one of the lowest income economies in \nCentral Asia, with gross national income per capita of $1,010 (Atlas method) in 2018. The national \npoverty rate is 27.4%, 12% of the population is extremely poor, and an additional 46% of the \npopulation is classified as vulnerable and at risk of falling into poverty.17 According to the 2016 \nTajikistan Labor Force Survey, about 29.4% of the labor force was informally employed, and high \nyouth unemployment (21%) is particularly problematic.18 Also, 73% of the population is based in \nrural areas, and agriculture absorbs 58% of the workforce, many of whom have low incomes and \ncomprise vulnerable groups close to the poverty line. Accelerating inflation combined with labor \nmarket impacts and lower remittances will significantly affect poor and vulnerable households.19 \n \n12 National Bank of Tajikistan.

Copenhagen. \n16 Tajikistan has 490 hospitals with 40,400 beds (44.3 beds per 10,000 people), 19,100 doctors (20.9 per 10,000 \npeople) and 54,000 paramedical (nursing) personnel (59.2 per 10,000 people) (Tajikistan Statistics Agency). \n17 Poverty figures are sourced from the Tajikistan Statistics Agency 2018 Household Budget Survey. \n18  International Labor Organization estimate. https://www.statista.com/statistics/813092/youth-unemployment-rate-in-\ntajikistan/ (accessed 1 June 2020). \n19 Tajikistan has 1,469,856 households, of which about 402,000 are poor and 676,000 are vulnerable (Tajikistan \nStatistics Agency).  \n ", "6 \nAs a result, ADB estimates unemployment to increase from 2.4% (official figures) to more than \n7.0%, while the poverty incidence could worsen from 27.4% to more than 30.0% as a result of \nCOVID-19, equivalent to about 250,000 people falling below the national poverty line.20  \n \n11.  Gender impact of COVID-19. Women are among those most vulnerable to the fallout \nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic. They are heavily represented in the health sector (84% of the total \nworkforce, including 39% of doctors and 99% of nurses) and are disproportionately at risk of \nexposure to infected patients. While the government has shifted much of its resources to combat \nCOVID-19, it has ensured that other health programs, such as maternal and child health (MCH) \nprograms, remain a priority. For example, MCH protocols will be adjusted to ensure that pregnant \nwomen and young children can continue to have health check-ups without risk of infection. New \nprotocols will also be developed to ensure \u0430omen\u2019s safet\u0432 from COVID-19 infection during labor. \nWomen make up around 50% of workers in the service industry and agriculture, and 24% of \nMSMEs in Tajikistan are owned by women, so COVID-19's negative impact on these economic \nsectors has displaced many of them. Of the businesses owned by women, 99% are classified as \nsmall and are disproportionately more vulnerable to falls in consumer demand and risk of closure. \nPurchasing food and essential goods is becoming less affordable, particularly for households \nheaded by women, which suffer from the sharp fall in remittances. 21 The number of women \nexperiencing  regular  physical,  psychological,  or  sexual  violence  may  increase  during  the \neconomic downturn. While COVID-19 measures are in place, responsible local government units \nwill be closely monitoring a potential increase in the cases of domestic violence. \n \n12.  Food  security.  The  prevalence  of  moderate  or  severe  food  insecurity  in  the  total \npopulation for 2016\u20132018 stands at 29.6%, almost double the 15.8% average for Central Asia.22 \nTajikistan is a net food importer, and food security is at risk from the impact of COVID-19. The \nprices of essential food items in the market, mostly those imported and subject to exchange rate \nfluctuations, increased in the first quarter of 2020, affecting the poor in particular.23 Kazakhstan is \na key source of wheat but has decreased its food exports to Tajikistan since the COVID-19 \noutbreak. The Eurasian Economic Union introduced restrictions on exports of food items to non-\nunion members such as Tajikistan, and on 26 April 2020 the Russian Federation embargoed \nwheat exports. 24 Besides being internally food-insecure, Tajikistan is mostly a price-taker in both \nimport and export markets, and the domestic supply chain is fragmented. Falling remittances and \nalternative income sources are in turn depriving farmers of the ability to purchase agricultural \ninputs such as seeds and fertilizer, which will lead to a reduction in agricultural production and \nfood supply. \n \n13.  Fiscal impact of COVID-19. The COVID-19 effects are leading to a decline in domestic \nconsumption  and  imports,  lowering  value-added  tax  (VAT)  and  customs  revenue  (which \ncontributes 47% to total tax revenues), while a decline in firms\u2019 output \u0430ill lo\u0430er income ta\u0431 \nrevenue. Total tax revenue projections have fallen 15.1% as a result, narrowing fiscal space. The \nbudget deficit is expected to expand from 5.2% to 7.7% of GDP in 2020 (Table 3). The government \nrationalized capital expenditures and re-allocated budget expenditure to its urgent COVID-19 \n \n20 The thresholds of the national poverty line based on monthly consumption are less than TJS162 for the poor, less \nthan TJS230 for the vulnerable, and less than TJS294 for middle income receivers. \n21 Tajikistan has 307,200 households headed by women (20.9%), which includes widowed or divorced women or those \nwhose husbands are working overseas (Tajikistan Statistics Agency). \n22 Food and Agriculture Organization. 2019.

ADB Support Through COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \n \n14.  Government countercyclical response to COVID-19. To mitigate the adverse impacts \nof COVID-19, the government approved the COVID-19 Country Preparedness and Response \nPlan and countercyclical measures totaling an estimated $364 million (Table 4). This includes (i) \na health sector and social protection response package to assist the poor and vulnerable \n($176 million), and (ii) a package of economic measures to ensure food security and to safeguard \nMSMEs prone to being severely affected ($188 million). The countercyclical measures to prevent \nand mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in Tajikistan were prepared in close consultation with key \ndevelopment partners, including ADB, the World Bank, WHO, the United Nations Development \nProgramme, and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). The government established a \nCOVID-19 interagency task force in February 2020 to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic and \ncoordinate the response, with daily meetings and reporting to the President. The task force is \nchaired by the Prime Minister and consists of representatives from the Ministry of Health and \nSocial Protection (MOHSP), Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, Ministry of Education \nand Science, Committee of Emergency Situations and Civil Defense, and Committee of Tourism \nDevelopment. \n \nTable 4: Countercyclical Measures \u2013 Cost Estimates \nMeasure  Cost \n($ million) \n1.

Health sector measures. The health sector response, prepared in close consultation with \nWHO and the United Nations Children's Fund, covers 10 key areas: (i) country-level coordination, \n(ii) risk  communications  and  community  engagement,  (iii) surveillance,  (iv)  points  of  entry, \n(v) case investigation and rapid response, (vi) national laboratory system, (vii) infection prevention \nand control, (viii) case management, (ix) multisector action to mitigate social and economic \nconsequences, and (x) logistics and supply management. Specific health measures include the \nprocurement of personal protective equipment and medicines ($4 million), ventilators ($14 million), \nand ambulances ($6 million); and the provision of additional salaries (100% top-up) to medical \nstaff working in medical facilities with infected patients, starting from 1 May 2020 and lasting at \nleast 3 months ($2 million). The task force also coordinates efforts to (i) strengthen the isolation \nfacilities in 14 existing hospitals nationwide for COVID-19 treatment and care ($3.5 million), \n(ii) train and equip rapid response teams for case investigation and contact tracing ($1 million), \nand (iii) strengthen national COVID-19 testing labs and train additional technicians ($2.5 million). \nThe health response aims to lower the rate of transmission. \n \n16.  Social protection measures. Social assistance transfers will be expanded to provide \npoor households affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with additional social protection. This will \nbe distributed through the government\u2019s Targeted Social Assistance (TSA) program, a cash \ntransfer mechanism for eligible poor households of TJS440 per beneficiary household per year \n(in quarterly payments). The TSA was initiated in 2014 with support from a World Bank program, \nis administered by MOHSP, and currently covers about 100,000 poor households in 40 districts,25 \nof which about 30,000 are headed by women. For the COVID-19 response, the TSA is being \nexpanded to an additional 107,000 households in the remaining 28 districts (on a permanent \nbasis). The 207,000 poor households in total (of which at least 30% are headed by women) will \nbenefit from a one-off additional transfer of TJS500 to be rolled out during June\u2013August 2020. \nThe eligible beneficiaries are identified using the MOHSP household database and income levels. \n \n17.  Food security measures. Food security measures ($28 million) include supply-side \nactivities to boost domestic production and the distribution of staple foods, including government \nimports and stockpiles of agricultural produce (potato, wheat, and oil crops). Agricultural inputs, \nincluding seeds and fertilizer, will be provided in kind, targeted to poor and vulnerable farmers in \nJune\u2013July 2020 for growing agricultural crops during the next season. The objective is to increase \nfood availability and generate production surpluses that can go toward restocking. From 30 March \n2020, the Ministry of Agriculture placed quotas on exports of wheat and flour. From 1 April 2020, \nthe government introduced exemptions of VAT (previously 18%) on imported basic food products \nsuch as sugar, vegetable oil, wheat, and rice, to lower the net price. From 25 April 2020, the \ngovernment imposed a ban on the export of food products such as rice, lentils, mung beans, \nbeans, potato, eggs, and meat, until the end of the year. The government is closely monitoring \nmarket food prices and prepares to put in place price controls for basic food items and medication, \nshould price increases become critical.  \n \n18.  Business  stabilization  and  employment  support  measures.  The  government\u2019s \npackage of stabilization measures ($160 million) aims to support the business continuity of \nMSMEs and employment. MSMEs contribute about 15% of GDP and are being disproportionately \nimpacted by COVID-19. Key support measures include temporary tax concessions and relief to \ndomestic producers and entrepreneurs. Tax holidays and tax relief measures will be targeted at \nentrepreneurs and businesses engaged in the production and/or import of food products and \n \n25 Proxy means testing is used to target the poorest 15%\u201320% of the population, and MOHSP maintains a centralized \ndatabase of beneficiaries compiled from local municipalities\u2019 data. Funds are transferred to registered beneficiary \naccounts at branches of Amonatbank (a state bank). Amounts not withdrawn after six months are returned. \n ", "9 \nmedical supplies, and sectors most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The scope and volume \nof assistance to such entrepreneurs and businesses will be prepared and approved by the \ngovernment. These measures are expected to cost TJS600.6 million in forgone tax revenue. The \ngovernment has provided VAT exemptions for imports of basic food items on top of existing \nexemptions for medical items. Additional concessional loans ($9 million) will be targeted at \nMSMEs in need of urgent financing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including businesses \nproducing or importing food and medical products. The concessional loans will be provided \nthrough the Entrepreneurship Support Fund, and loan applications from MSMEs will be reviewed \nby the Supervisory Board. 26 A moratorium on business inspections by government agencies, \nincluding tax inspections and audits, will be extended to all businesses. As of 1 May 2020, NBT \nreduced the policy interest rate from 12.75% to 11.75% to support businesses. Previously, on 1 \nApril 2020, NBT had reduced the compulsory reserve requirements for financial institutions\u2014in \ndollars from 9% to 5% and in somoni from 3% to 1%\u2014until the end of 2020, which will increase \nliquidity by about $24 million equivalent.  \n \n19.  Debt sustainability. The joint IMF\u2013World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis completed in \nDecember 2019, before the shock, found that Tajikistan remains at high risk of debt distress. The \ncountry\u2019s debt-carrying capacity was assessed as medium, upgraded from low. External public \ndebt accounts for 82% of total public debt, and 80% of external public debt is on concessional \nterms. ADB's own updated debt sustainability analysis (available from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2) estimates that post-shock fiscal expansion and increased concessional borrowing \nas well as slower growth will increase total public debt from 45.4% of GDP in 2019 to 47.6% of \nGDP in 2020 in the baseline scenario, stabilizing in the medium term. In the shock scenario with \nlower growth projections, the debt\u2013GDP ratio may increase to 48.4% by 2024, and debt is \nassessed to be sustainable based on fiscal projections. The proposed $50 million ADB grant will \ncreate fiscal space and help improve debt sustainability. Loans under negotiation or already \napproved by other international financial institutions in 2020 are on concessional terms, jointly \nrepresent about 6.6% of the countr\u0432\u2019s public debt stock, and will not significantly increase the \ndebt\u2013GDP ratio or increase the annual debt service obligations of the government. The IMF, in \nMarch 2020, also approved total debt relief to Tajikistan of $28.49 million through the Catastrophe \nContainment  and  Relief  Trust,  which  had  a  positive  effect  on  debt  sustainability.27 The \ngovernment  has  committed  to  undertake  medium-term  fiscal  consolidation  including \nreprioritization of public spending, avoid nonconcessional external borrowing, and strengthen \npublic debt management with technical support from development partners, to further improve \ndebt sustainability.  \n \n20.  Development partner coordination. ADB has a strong partnership with the IMF in \nTajikistan,  and  the  program  team  closely  coordinated  with  IMF  staff  on  aspects  such  as \nTajikistan\u2019s  latest  macroeconomic  assessment  and  outlook,  fiscal  risks,  debt  sustainability, \nmeasures introduced for the government\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and preparation \nof ADB and IMF support programs. The World Bank approved a project for $11.3 million (grant) \nin April 2020 to prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Close collaboration between \nADB and key development partners on planned COVID-19 assistance is also ensured through \nthe donor coordination council forum.28  \n \n \n26 The Entrepreneurship Support Fund is a government-administered and budgeted fund established in 2013. It \nprovides concessional loans to small businesses and entrepreneurs. Loan decisions are made at the level of the \nSupervisory Board, and screening and underwriting functions are delegated to the State Savings Bank of Tajikistan. \n27 IMF. 2020.

Lessons. The CARES program draws on the 2009 Crisis Recovery Support Program for \nTajikistan, which yielded several lessons.29 First, during crisis episodes, while policy reforms are \nimportant, the government needs to quickly stabilize the economy, i.e., provide urgent fiscal \nsupport to counteract the crisis. Crisis response operations should therefore focus on immediate \nresponse measures, such as maintaining or expanding critical social safety net expenditures. \nHowever, since crises open opportunities for reforms, policy dialogue may be initiated on follow-\nup operations. Second, the success of a crisis response program hinges on the government\u2019s \nability to quickly formulate its own anti-crisis plan, to be financed by ADB after exercising due \ndiligence and contributing to the plan. The government's readiness to implement it is also \nimportant. Third, since crisis response operations support the government\u2019s crisis mitigation \nmeasures, program monitoring and reporting can benefit from technical assistance (TA) where \ncountry systems have weaknesses. Such TA can also focus on expenditure-tracking mechanisms, \ninternal controls, and external audits. \n \n22.  ADB assistance. The proposed CARES program is part of a comprehensive package of \ncomplementary  ADB  support  to  Tajikistan  in  response  to  COVID-19.  ADB  is  currently \nimplementing the Tajikistan Maternal and Child Health Integrated Care Project ($32 million grant) \nto improve MCH care services, infrastructure, and equipment, which is on track.30 In response to \na request from MOHSP, ADB (i) reallocated $100,000 from the Maternal and Child Health \nIntegrated Care Project to finance COVID-19 prevention and mitigation, medical supplies, and \nequipment; and (ii) allocated a $928,200 grant to Tajikistan from ADB regional TA to further \nprocure urgently needed personal protective equipment.31 ADB is also preparing the Tajikistan \nSkills and Employability Enhancement Project ($30 million grant), which will build three new job \nand migrant services centers, and provide skills training to youth, women, and migrant workers to \nimprove their employability. These services will benefit migrant workers and other vulnerable \ngroups affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and will help reduce their dependence \non remittances.  \n \n23.  ADB value addition. In the medium term, ADB will continue policy dialogue with the \ngovernment to  improve  the  countr\u0432\u2019s  resilience  to  shocks through structural  reforms.  ADB \npreviously supported the government with reforms through the Investment Climate Reforms \nProgram,  to  increase  private  investment,  economic  diversification,  and  inclusive  growth.32 \nThrough the CARES program, ADB's polic\u0432 advice and contributions to the government\u2019s COVID-\n19 countercyclical response plans ensured targeting of the vulnerable segments of the economy \nand  society,  especially  MSMEs  (including  those  engaged  in  cross-border  trade),  the  poor \n(including households headed by women), and communities in remote and border areas. ADB \nwill mobilize TA resources to support the implementation and monitor and report on the progress \nof the government\u2019s COVID-19 response measures. Consulting services for these activities will \nbe engaged using additional financing of $250,000 for an existing transaction TA project (TA \n9894).33 This will improve the executing agency's capacity for program monitoring and evaluation, \ndata collection (including sex-disaggregated data) and reporting, and financial management, in \nline  with  ADB  requirements.  ADB  consultants  will  ensure  that  quality  expenditure-tracking \nmechanisms, internal controls, and audits are in place or undertaken, and will independently \n \n29 ADB. 2010.

The continuation of ADB's support to the government\u2019s reform agenda in 2020\u20132021 \nincludes the Financial Sector and Fiscal Management Improvement Program, which will assist \nwith reforms to enable more private investment. This is to be achieved through a well-functioning \nfinance  sector  and  stronger  public  financial  management,  by  developing  the  government\u2019s \nmedium-term budget framework and SOE financial reporting, and adopting international public \nsector accounting standards.35 The Power Sector Development Program to support the reform \nand restructuring of the state-owned power utility (Barqi Tojik) is also under preparation ($105 \nmillion, including a $20 million budget support component). In aggregate, these reforms will help \nensure fiscal sustainability, improve the investment climate, and lead to greater stability and \neconomic recovery in the long term.  \n \nC.  Effects of ADB Program and Outputs \n \n24.  The proposed CARES program will support the implementation of the government\u2019s \ncountercyclical measures, targeting the poor and vulnerable while meeting financing needs and \nachieving debt sustainability. The program is aligned with the overarching development objective: \nCOVID-19 transmission reduced while minimizing economic, public, and social impacts. The \neffect of the program will be: COVID-19 outbreak more effectively managed, and social and \neconomic impacts reduced. The program has three outputs: (i) health measures for COVID-19 \ncountry preparedness and response implemented, (ii) increased social assistance and food \nsecurity measures implemented, and (iii) enhanced support for business entities and measures \nto safeguard employment implemented. The proposed CARES program grant is $50 million.36 \nThe program is coordinated with ADB\u2019s overall assistance package to the CAREC region, \nincorporating a regional cooperation aspect in responding to this global as well as regional crisis. \nThe program will also support CAREC-2030\u2019s Operational Cluster 5 (human development), b\u0432 \naddressing pandemic risks and controlling transboundary communicable diseases. The regional \nTA (footnote 31) will complement the program by sharing regional experiences, information, and \nlessons. The CARES program will also promote the adoption of international preparedness and \nresponse standards and best practices, especially those recommended by WHO, to manage \npandemics and public health emergencies. Food, medical items, seeds, and fertilizers from \nneighboring countries will be procured as measures for the COVID-19 response. The program is \naligned \u0430ith ADB\u2019s Strateg\u0432 2030, including its operational priorities of (i) addressing remaining \npoverty and reducing inequalities, (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality, (iii) strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity, and (iv) fostering regional cooperation and integration.37 \nThe  program  aligns  \u0430ith  these  priorities  b\u0432  strengthening  the  government\u2019s  capacit\u0432  for \nimplementing the countercyclical responses; targeting the response measures, including social \nassistance, at \u0430omen and poor and vulnerable groups; and coordinating \u0430ith ADB\u2019s regional \nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n \n34 ADB. 2018.

Development financing needs. Tajikistan's financing needs based on the revised 2020 \npost-COVID-19 budget are estimated to reach $735 million (Table 5). The government has limited \ndomestic borrowing capacity available because of an undeveloped government securities market \nand low demand for government treasury bills, although it plans to raise $10 million from the \nissuance of government securities. External funding to meet the remaining financing needs is \nexpected to be sourced largely from concessional loans and grants provided by international \nfinance institutions. The IMF approved a rapid credit facility of $189.5 million (80% of the IMF \nquota) on 6 May 2020 with a single-tranche disbursement. The ADB CARES program grant will \nfinance a 6.8% share of Tajikistan's 2020 financing needs. Two additional ADB budget support \ngrant operations under preparation are programmed in 2020, including the $50 million Financial \nSector and Fiscal Management Improvement Program (para. 23) and $20 million from the Power \nSector Development Program (subject to ADB Board approval).38 The government expects other \nsources of concessional external financing to meet the financing gap, including a $50 million \nconcessional loan from the Eurasian Fund for Stabilization and Development and additional \nfinancing from the World Bank. 39 \n \nTable 5: Tajikistan's Financing Needs for 2020 \nAmount, pre- Amount, post-  \nCOVID-19   COVID-19   Change \nItem  ($ million)  ($ million)  (%) \nTotal financing requirement (including PIP)  538.3  735.0  36.5 \nDomestic financing  8.0  10.0  25.0 \nExternal financing (tentative)  530.3  725.0  36.7 \n- IMF    189.5 \n- ADB    120.0 \n- EFSD    50.0 \n- Other IFIs or bilateral partners    3.5 \n- PIPa    362.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, EFSD = Eurasian Fund for Stabilization and \nDevelopment, IFI = international financial institution, IMF = International Monetary Fund, PIP = public investment \nprogram. \na  PIP includes development partner project loans (related to energy, health, education, transport, urban development, \nclimate change, disaster reduction, and gender).  \nSource: Ministry of Finance and ADB estimates. \n \nE.

The 2018 worldwide governance indicators for Tajikistan are below the regional average \nand rank in the bottom 20th percentile for all categories, including (i) voice and accountability, \n(ii) political stability, (iii) government effectiveness, (iv) regulatory quality, (v) rule of law, and \n(vi) control of corruption.40 In the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index 2019, \nTajikistan scored 25% and ranked 153rd out of 180 counties.41 The Public Expenditure and \nFinancial Accountability assessment for 2017 shows that some improvements were made since \n2012  in  four  of  six  pillars,  and  in  most  indicators,  reflecting  more  robust  public  financial \nmanagement.42 The main areas of improvement are: (i) comprehensiveness and transparency of \nbudget information, (ii) predictability and control in budget execution, (iii) accounting and reporting, \nand (iv) external scrutiny and audit. Areas identified for further improvement: (i) expenditure \ncomposition outturn by function, (ii) public access to fiscal information, (iii) investment project \nselection, and (iv) medium-term expenditure estimates. A new public financial management \nstrategy covering 2020\u20132030 was approved in January 2020, with the key objectives of improving \nfiscal discipline, and allocative efficiency and transparency of public financial resources. The \nstrategy highlights key reform areas, priorities, and sequencing, and will help improve the weaker \nareas in the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment. The government has \nbeen implementing reforms to improve governance, including measures to reduce tax incentives \nand concessions and increase public spending efficiency, SOE governance, and finance sector \nand central bank governance. The reforms are being supported by ADB and development \npartners and are helping reduce vulnerability to corruption and boost the prospects for sustainable \ngrowth. ADB is assisting efforts to improve the medium-term budget framework and public sector \naccounting (footnote 35) as well as SOE governance in the energy sector through a sector \ndevelopment  program  under  preparation  (para.  23).  The  government  is  improving  public \nprocurement legislation, and has begun a comprehensive process to introduce a new tax code in \n2021 to improve tax policy and administration, simplify the tax structure, and widen the tax base. \nElectronic  filing  of  tax  returns  and  online  payments  were  introduced  to  modernize  tax \nadministration and reduce corruption. The World Bank's Doing Business indicators for Tajikistan \nimproved considerably in 2019, from reforms that made it easier to start a business, improved \naccess to credit, and enhanced trade facilitation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n40 World Bank. 2019.

The poor and vulnerable are most at risk to crises in Tajikistan, have the least means to \nrespond, and may find it difficult to finance basic needs if their already low incomes are reduced. \nGovernment initiatives supported by the CARES program will help mitigate price and income \nshocks, especially for vulnerable groups and women. Measures targeted at poor households \ninclude social protection initiatives that will provide additional social assistance transfers to \n207,000 poor households. Food security measures supported by the program will help low-\nincome farmers increase their agricultural production and will ensure that the prevalence of \nmoderate or severe food insecurity in the total population does not increase above the 2019 \nbaseline of 29.6%. VAT exemptions and cost control measures will be applied to food and medical \nitems to lower the net cost, which will benefit poor households. \n \nC.   Gender  \n \n29.  The program is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming and focuses on ensuring \nthat women can equitably benefit from the government's COVID-19 response. In the health sector, \nthe program will ensure that all health workers directly working with COVID-19 patients are \nproperly protected with an adequate quantity of properly fitting personal protective equipment, \nand menstrual hygiene kits, as necessary. This measure will meet the specific needs of female \nhealth care staff and help avoid higher exposure and the risk of infection among female doctors \nand nurses. Gender-sensitive features will be incorporated in the hospitals' designated isolation \nareas for COVID-19 patients, such as separate female and male COVID-19 wards, and sex-\nsegregated facilities for medical staff. The MOHSP household database will be used to target \npoor households headed by women for the additional social assistance. The program will provide \ntax relief and financial support to crisis-affected MSMEs, including those owned by women, to \nhelp them recover. This will mitigate the loss of income for women entrepreneurs and business \nowners, as well as maintain employment (women make up at least 50% of the MSME workforce). \nA systematic information campaign will be staged to reach all eligible MSMEs, especially those \nowned by women, that may otherwise have limited access to information, along with clear \nguidelines on how to access this financial support. The program will enable (i) a salary increase \nof 100% for all frontline medical staff directly managing COVID-19 cases, of which at least 80% \nwill be women; (ii) the provision of medical protection equipment for health workers, of which 84% \nare women; (iii) additional targeted social assistance transfers for poor and vulnerable households, \nof which at least 30% are headed by women; and (iv) support measures for micro, small, and \nmedium-sized enterprises, of which 24% are owned by women. The gender monitoring matrix \n(available from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) will be used as a tool for monitoring \nprogress  in  achieving  gender  targets  and  indicators,  collecting  sex-disaggregated  data  for \nreporting, and ensuring that the program-supported measures do indeed benefit women. The \nCARES program compliments the ongoing ADB Maternal and Child Health Integrated Care \nProject (footnote 30), which is simultaneously providing health support to women by improving \nthe quality of MCH services during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n \nD.   Safeguards \n \n30.  In compliance \u0430ith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Polic\u0432 Statement (2009), the program is classified \ncategory C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The program is \nnot expected to have any adverse environmental or social safeguard impacts, and no category A \nor B activities are envisaged. An assessment of the program's potential impacts on safeguards is \nprovided as a supplementary document. ADB proceeds will not be used for the purpose of any \nnew physical construction (temporary or permanent) or an expansion of existing medical facilities. \n ", "15 \nThe program \u0430ill confirm such e\u0431clusions through MOF\u2019s monthly and quarterly reporting on \nconsolidated expenditures. \n \nE.

From 30 April to 31 May 2020, 3,930 positive \nCOVID-19 cases and 47 deaths were reported. Economic transmission \nmechanisms to Tajikistan include a sharp reduction in remittances, \ninternational trade and foreign direct investment, and slowdown of the \ntransport,  tourism,  retail,  and  financial  sectors.  Tajikistan  is \nexperiencing a significant negative economic impact from COVID-19, \ndue to preventative measures and external factors slowing domestic \nconsumption and firms\u2019 output, including MSMEs. In March 2020, the \ncurrency was devalued by 5%. The COVID-19 pandemic will plunge the \nMiddle East and Central Asia region into a recession with negative \ngrowth of \u20132.8% forecast in 2020. Economic growth for Tajikistan is \nexpected to fall sharply from 7.5% of GDP in 2019 to \u20132% in 2020 based \non  IMF  estimates  as  a  direct  result  of  COVID-19.  The  IMF  had \npreviously forecast growth would slow to 4.8% of GDP in 2020, largely \nfrom fiscal consolidation and lower public investment, which has been \nsignificantly exacerbated with the COVID-19 shock. All sectors will be \naffected and the service sector, which is the largest sector contributing \nto around 50% of GDP, is expected to contract by 4.3% of GDP in 2020. \nA shortfall in revenue by 15% will increase the fiscal deficit from 5.2% \nto 7.7% of GDP. \nCountercyclical  To mitigate adverse impacts of COVID-19 and finance the approved \ndevelopment expenditure  COVID-19 County Preparedness and Response Plan, the government \nhas  adopted  countercyclical  measures  totaling  $364  million.  This \nincludes (i) a health sector and social protection response package to \nassist the poor and vulnerable ($176 million), and (ii) a package of \neconomic measures to ensure food security, and safeguard businesses \nprone to be severely affected, including women-owned businesses \n($188 million). The government\u2019s health and social protection measures \ninclude procurement of medical protective equipment and medicines, \nventilators, and ambulances, and strengthening facilities to treat and \ncare for COVID-19 patients. Additional salaries (100% top up) will be \nprovided to medical personnel working in quarantine medical facilities \nor with infected patients for at least 3 months ($2 million) starting from \n1 May 2020. Additional one-time social assistance transfers of TJS500 \nper household have been allocated for poor households, of which at \nleast 30% are woman-headed. This cash transfer will be distributed \nthrough the government\u2019s Targeted Social Assistance Program, for \nwhich the government is also increasing the number of beneficiaries and \ngeographical  coverage.  The  aim  of  the  government\u2019s  package  of \nstabilization measures ($160) million is to mitigate the impact of the \npandemic  on  the  population  and  employment  through  enhancing \nsupport to the business community, particularly MSMEs.

After the 2015 \nmacroeconomic  financial crisis the government was able to bring the budget deficit under \nmanagement  control,  which  has  averaged  3.9%  over  2016-2019.  High  public \ninvestment  and  increasing  remittances  have  led  to  strong  growth \naveraging over 7% per annum in recent years, despite weak private \ninvestment, and has improved poverty reduction. Growth rose from \n7.3% in 2018 to 7.5% in 2019 driven by public investment, higher \nremittances,  and  ongoing  state-led  industrialization  boosting \nmanufacturing output. The tax to GDP ratio is relatively high and has \nbeen stable averaging 21% of GDP over 2017-2019. Inflation has been \ndampened by improved monetary operations, and remained within \nNBT\u2019s target range, although e\u0431change rate polic\u0432 remains restrictive. \nPre-COVID-19 shock, the fiscal deficit was projected to increase to \n5.2% of GDP in 2020 and then stabilize averaging 4% of GDP over \n2020-22. Total public debt was on course to decline from a peak of \n50.4% of GDP in 2017 to 46.4% in 2020. The government has also \ntaken  positive  steps  to  improve  supervision  and  regulation  in  the \nbanking sector. Non-performing loans have fallen from 47.6% in 2016 \nto 26.1% in 2019 and profitability has improved since 2015, although \ntwo large state-owned banks remain insolvent.

Loans  under  negotiation  or  already \napproved by other international financial institutions in 2020 are on \nconcessional terms, jointly represent around 6.6% of the countr\u0432\u2019s \npublic debt stock and will neither significantly affect the debt-to-GDP \nratio nor increase the annual debt service obligations of the government. \nThe  IMF  has  also  approved  debt  relief  to  Tajikistan  through  the \nCatastrophe Containment and Relief Trust of $28.49 million which has \nimproved debt sustainability. To improve debt sustainability further, the \ngovernment  is  seeking  medium  term  fiscal  consolidation  including \nreprioritization of public spending, avoiding non-concessional external \nborrowing, and strengthening public debt management with technical \nsupport from development partners.  \nIMF Coordination  The ADB program team has coordinated closely with IMF staff on \nTajikistan\u2019s latest macroeconomic outlook and risks, fiscal measures \nbeing  introduced  in  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  and \npreparation of ADB and IMF support for the government\u2019s response, \nincluding the proposed ADB program.
