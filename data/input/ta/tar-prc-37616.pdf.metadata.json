During  the  2004  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) confirmed its request for technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to assist the government of Shanxi province to address poverty \nreduction in coal mine areas in Shanxi province, to be financed by the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation Fund.1 In September 2004, a fact-finding mission was fielded to assess results of \navailable studies and determine the scope of the TA. Members of the fact-finding mission held \ndiscussions with representatives from the PRC Government and Shanxi provincial government. \nAn understanding was reached on the TA goals, purpose, scope, cost estimates, financing and \nimplementation arrangements, and the consultants\u2019 terms of reference. The TA is included in the \ncountry pipeline for 2004. The TA framework is given in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In 2003 the production of coal in the PRC was about 1.7 billion tons, which in 2004 was \nexpected to increase to about 1.9 billion tons. In general, coal mining is undertaken in three \ntypes of mines, including (i) key state-owned coal mines (KSOCMs), (ii) local state-owned coal \nmines (SOCMs), and (iii) town and village coal mines (TVCMs). It is estimated that in 2003, \nKSOCMs, which include the large, mechanized coal mines, accounted for about 48% of total \ncoal production in the PRC while SOCMs produced about 17%. At the same time, TVCMs and \nillegal small coal mines produced about 35%.2 Small coal mines, defined as mines that produce \nnot more than 300,000 tons of coal a year, make up about half of the SOCMs, most of the \nTVCMs, and all illegal coal mines, and employ about 2 million miners. \n \n3.  For further development of its coal resources, the Government is giving priority to the \nconstruction of large, mechanized mines3 and the modernization and production improvement of \nexisting large and medium coal mines. With regard to small coal mines, the Government is \npursuing the closure of those mines that have failed to adopt required safety practices, operate \nwithout a license, or are considered illegal. It is estimated that since 1998, more than 16,000 \nTVCMs and tens of thousands of small, illegal coal mines have been closed. However, since the \nabolition of the Ministry of Coal Industry in 1996 the responsibility for supervising the operations \nof coal mines, including the implementation of laws, regulations, and policies for small coal \nmines, has been delegated to the provinces and local governments, which often do not have \nadequate resources. Consequently, local government supervision of the operation of small \nmines and their compliance with government laws and regulations is inadequate, which has \nresulted in unsafe, unhealthy, and hazardous working conditions in the mines; environmental \ndamage, such as land subsidence; improper disposal of mine waste; inadequate restoration \nwork;  inefficient  mining  and  production  of  poor  quality  coal;  and  loss  of  recoverable  coal \nreserves. Likewise, inspection and closure of small coal mines due to their noncompliance with \ngovernment policies and regulations have been uneven and often ineffective.  \n \n4.  Closure of TVCMs has also led to increased unemployment of mostly poorly educated \nmanual workers with little or no formal mine training. Reemployment of such miners in SOCMs \nor KSOCMs is likewise difficult given the inability of many to successfully complete training \nprograms in the special skills required for miners to be employed in SOCMs and KSOCMs. \nFurther, because of their higher productivity, new, modern coal mines require relatively fewer \nminers than the closed TVCMs while miners at TVCMs usually include migrant workers from \nother  provinces  for  whom  the  concerned  provincial  government  has  no  legal  obligation  to \nprovide an alternative livelihood. As a result, closure of TVCMs will directly affect the livelihood \nof the poor who do not have much opportunity of finding alternative livelihoods except in new, \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 7 February 2004. \n2   There are only a few private coal mines in the PRC. \n3  At present the construction of 25 coal mines with a total capacity of more than 60 million tons is being accelerated \nand about 140 additional large coal mines are to built in the next few years.   ", "2  \nillegal coal mining. Closure of TVCMs may therefore actually encourage illegal coal mining, in \nparticular when demand for coal is increasing. In addition to an increase in the number of \nunemployed persons, local governments at the county level will also experience a reduction in \ntheir fiscal income following the closure of TVCMs. They will therefore be reluctant to close \nTVCMs unless they are replaced with alternative economic activity such as the development of \nan SOCM or a KSOCM. \n \n5.   Local governments with intensive small coal mining activities are invariably reliant on \ntax income from the mines to finance local services and economic development\u2014in particular, \nafter the 1994 tax reform when the national Government\u2019s contribution to a local government\u2019s \nbudget was reduced from 70% to 48%. Experience shows that local governments are more \ninclined to close small or illegal coal mines if the economic and social impacts of such closure \ncan to some extent be mitigated by the opening up of new, large coal mines that would provide \nlocal governments with a replacement source of revenue and implementation of job creation \nprograms to reduce social deprivation among redundant miners who do not have the skills, \naptitude, and knowledge to work in modern, mechanized coal mines. \n \n6.  In the absence of any planning for the economic and social mitigation of the closure of \nsmall coal mines, various parties and stakeholders are affected and will experience negative \nimpacts  from  the  closure  of  small  coal  mines,  including  (i)  local  governments,  which  will \nexperience a  decline  in  revenue  thus  reducing  their  ability  to  invest  in  new  infrastructure; \n(ii) mine  owners,  including  local  government  owners,  who  will  receive  inadequate  or  no \ncompensation for lost assets and are only entitled to some compensation if the concerned coal \nmine is considered wholly legal; (iii) the redundant miners, who will have few opportunities to \nfind an alternative livelihood; and (iv) local farmers, who will lose compensation for the use of \nthe land by the small coal mines and will be unable to arrange for reclamation or rehabilitation of \nthe  polluted  land  and  water.  In  principle,  the  provincial  Land  and  Resources  Bureau  is \nresponsible for mine restoration, but usually lacks the resources for managing residual liabilities, \nsurface gas hazards, surface stability, and post-closure monitoring. \n \n7.  Shanxi province has a population of about 32 million and accounts for about 30% of the \nPRC\u2019s coal production. The province has coal reserves of more than 740 billion tons of which \nabout 150 billion tons are located at a depth of less than 1,000 meters from the surface. At \npresent, about 20 billion tons of proven coal reserves are available for development of new \nmines. In 2003, the province had 84 KSOCMs, 448 SOCMs, and about 4,000 small coal mines, \nincluding TVCMs and illegal coal mines, which employed about 290,000 persons. The air quality \nin Shanxi province is among the worst of any region in the PRC and the province has three of \nthe PRC\u2019s 10 most polluted cities. The environmental problems are closely related to the \nutilization and production of coal. Pollution from coal mining, adverse hygiene, poor nutrition, \nand lack of education have contributed to an anomalous incidence of birth defect problems. The \nburning of dirty coal from small mines produces widespread low level pollution affecting the \nhealth of local communities. Closure of small coal mines would reduce this, provided that \ncleaner coal or alternative energy is made available in its place at similar cost.  \n \n8.  Originally, the development plan of Shanxi province envisaged annual coal production of \n300\u2013350  million  tons  by  2005  and  380\u2013400  million  tons  by  2010.  However,  present  coal \nproduction in the province already exceeds these targets and considerable investments in new \ncoal mines are required to replace the KSOCMs that were closed due to depletion of their coal \nreserves4  and  the  small  coal  mines  that  were  closed  due  to  their  noncompliance  with \ngovernment policies and regulations, and to meet the increased demand for coal. At the same \ntime, Shanxi provincial government has decreed that all new and to be modernized coal mines \nshould have an annual production capacity of more than 300,000 tons. It has also drafted \n                                                 \n4  It estimated that due to depletion of coal reserves, 27 KSOCMs will be closed during the 10th Five-Year Plan \n(2000\u20132005). ", "  3 \nprocedures for closing small coal mines, including TVCMs, with an annual coal production of \nless than 90,000 tons and plans to close all such mines, totaling about 1,750, during 2005. Over \nrecent years, Shanxi provincial government has closed about 448 small coal mines, which has \nresulted in about 47,000 redundant miners. \n \n9.  If Shanxi provincial government fully implements its policy to close all small coal mines \nwith an annual production capacity of less than 90,000 tons during 2005, it would result in the \nredundancy of an additional 184,000 miners and reduce annual coal production by about 72 \nmillion tons. In particular, there would be six counties in Shanxi province with more than 100 \nclosures of small coal mines and 13 counties with 50\u2013100 closures of small coal mines. In \nparticular, the area around Jincheng,5 where some 235 small coal mines would be closed, \nwould experience a relatively large redundancy of coal miners. Shanxi provincial government \nhas not yet developed any specific poverty reduction or training programs for redundant miners. \nSometimes the local Poverty Reduction Bureau provides training in basic education, basic \nagriculture, or animal husbandry to some laid-off miners as part of the assistance provided to all \nthe poor in a particular area, or the provincial branch of the National Coal Administration Bureau \nprovides technical training to some others for their reemployment in larger coal mines. However, \navailable budgets are insufficient and most laid-off miners will not receive any assistance and \nwill be unable to find any alternative income unless they accept work in other small, illegal coal \nmines. The development of a comprehensive assistance program for areas with a relatively high \nincidence of closure of small coal mines is therefore required to develop a environmentally \nsustainable and safe coal mining industry, reduce unemployment, and raise the living standards \nof  poor,  rural  communities.  ADB  assistance  for  development  of  such  a  program  will  also \ncomplement  other  ADB-financed  projects6  and  advisory  TAs7  provided  for  reducing  the \nenvironmental impact of energy use in the province.          \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The purpose of the TA is to assist Shanxi provincial government with the development of \na model socioeconomic and environmental mitigation program that will focus on retraining \nredundant  miners,  developing  job  creation  schemes  for  redundant  miners,  and  reducing \nenvironmental impacts for poor communities following the closure of large numbers of small \ncoal mines in accordance with national and provincial policy. A study will be undertaken in the \narea around Jincheng to identify and evaluate the specific options available to reduce the \nnumber of redundant and unemployed miners and determine a corresponding strategy for the \ncreation of alternative economic activities and their reemployment. Options to provide training \nfor reemployment in the larger mechanized coal mines, or in other sectors of the economy in the \nregion, will be identified. The implications for wider application of the model training and job \ncreation program in poor coal mining areas throughout the PRC will be assessed. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will be carried out in four phases. During phase I, the consultants will undertake \ninitial data gathering and preliminary analysis, and prepare outline policy recommendations. \n                                                 \n5   Including the counties of Changzhi,  Gaoping, and Zhesou. \n6  Including the Shanxi Environment Improvement Project (ADB. 1999. Report and Recommendation of the President \nto the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and Technical Assistance Grant to the People\u2019s Republic of China \nfor Shanxi Environment Improvement Project. Manila) and the Coal Mine Methane Development (ADB. 2004. \nReport and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China for the Coal Mine Methane Development.

Manila. \n ", "4  \nUnder phase II, the consultants will identify options for training and reemployment programs \nbased  on  international  experience.  Under  phase  III,  the  consultants  will  develop  specific \nassistance programs for the area around Jincheng, including a plan for monitoring the social, \neconomic, and environmental impacts of the closure of small coal mines. Under phase IV, the \nconsultants will implement the developed programs and plans in a particular location around \nJincheng,8 assess the requirements for adoption of similar programs and plans in other parts of \nthe PRC, disseminate the results of the TA, and prepare an action plan for adoption of similar \nmechanisms  and  programs  in  other  parts  of  the  PRC.  The  consultants  will  organize  two \nworkshops. The first, a consultation workshop, will be held with the main stakeholders, including \ngovernment  organizations  and  policy  makers  involved  in  poverty  reduction  and  rural \ndevelopment in the area around Jincheng and in Shanxi province; representatives of local coal \nmines;  the  State  Administration  of  Work  Safety;  funding  agencies;  and  Shanxi  provincial \ngovernment to discuss the TA findings and recommendations. The second workshop will be \nheld to present, disseminate, and discuss the final report at a national workshop with the \nparticipation  of  Shanxi  provincial  government,  representatives  from  the  PRC  coal  sector, \nnational poverty reduction agencies, funding agencies, and nongovernment organizations. The \noutline terms of reference for consultant are given in Appendix 2. \n \n12.  Key activities will include (i) a detailed analysis of the role of small-scale coal mining in \nthe economic and social structure in the Jincheng area and the impact of small coal mine \nclosures on poverty incidence and environment in the same area; (ii) evaluation of the local \ngovernment\u2019s efforts for reemployment of the miners and creating new economic activities; \n(iii) identification of the most likely scenario for closure of additional small-scale coal mines over \nthe next 5 years; (iv) identification of policy options for the local and national governments to \nsupport and promote the reemployment of the redundant miners, creation of new economic \nactivities, including consolidation and transformation of small coal mines into larger coal mines \nwhere  appropriate,  and  mitigation  of  the  environmental  impact  of  such  mine  closures; \n(v) formulation  of  an  appropriate  reemployment  and  economic  development  strategy; \n(vi) assistance to the local government in its current efforts to provide training to redundant \nminers for reemployment in the larger mines or finding alternative livelihoods; (vii) development \nof model short and long-term support mechanisms and training programs to assist redundant \nminers to find alternative employment and local governments to create alternative economic \nactivities; and (viii) dissemination of the results of the TA and develop an action plan for \nadoption of similar mechanisms and programs in other parts of the PRC. \n \n13.  The major risks that need to be considered for the successful implementation of the TA \ninclude inadequate counterpart support, lack of adequate and in-time provision of data, delay in \nsubmission of required studies, delay in consultant selection, and poor consultant performance. \nIn addition, Shanxi provincial government\u2019s continuous commitment to implement its policy to \nclose of small coal mines and provide adequate support for creation of alternative economic \nactivities and the reemployment of redundant miners is necessary for the success of the TA. \nClose coordination of activities of the consultants, executing and implementing agencies, and \nADB will also be required.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $700,000  equivalent  with  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of \n$335,000 and a local currency cost of $365,000 equivalent (Appendix 3). ADB will provide \n$500,000 equivalent to finance $335,000 of the foreign exchange cost and $165,000 equivalent \nof the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation  Fund  and  will  be  administered  by  ADB.  Shanxi  provincial  government  will \n                                                 \n8  Possible areas include the counties of Qingsui, Yangcheng, and Zezhou and the municipality of Gaoping, which \nincludes about 73,000 poor miners and household members with an average annual income of less than CNY960 \nper person.  ", "  5 \ncontribute $200,000 equivalent representing about 29% of the TA cost, to finance the remaining \nlocal currency cost. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  SDRC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,9  which  will  appoint  the  Jincheng  Municipal \nDevelopment and Reform Commission (JMDRC) as TA implementing agency. ADB will select \nand engage the services of international and domestic consultants according to its Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants. The consultants will have expertise in institutional, economic, financial, \nenvironmental, and social analyses; poverty impact assessment; poverty reduction; and training \nin rural coal mining areas. An estimated total of 31 person-months of consulting services will be \nrequired, including 9 person-months of international consulting services and 22 person-months \nof domestic consulting services.10 The services of consultants will be provided through the \nselection of a consulting firm, comprising international and domestic consultants, following the \nsubmission of simplified technical proposals and the use of the quality-and-cost-based selection \nmethod. The TA is expected to commence in May 2005 and be completed by December 2005. \n \n16.  JMDRC  will  establish  a  counterpart  team  comprising  representatives  of  the  Shanxi \nJincheng  Coal  Mining  Bureau  and  the  Shanxi  Jincheng  Poverty  Reduction  Office.  The \ncounterpart team will work in close cooperation with the Jincheng Labor Bureau, the county \ngovernment of the demonstration area, and township governments and village committees \nfrom areas that are most affected by the closure of the small coal mines; it will also closely \ninteract with the consultants. SDRC will also establish a steering committee comprising senior \nofficials of Shanxi provincial government; the Shanxi Environmental Protection Bureau; and \nrepresentatives from other government organizations and agencies involved in formulating and \nimplementing policies concerning the closure of small coal mines, such as the Ministry of Land \nand Resources, the State Administration of Work Safety, and the National Coal Association. \nThe steering committee will also act as the main conduit for conveying and interpreting the \nGovernment\u2019s views on policy issues, generally oversee the implementation of the TA, and \ninteract with ADB during TA review missions. The counterpart team members will interact with \nmembers of the steering committee to seek clarifications on issues and matters that fall outside \nthe purview of Shanxi provincial government. Shanxi provincial government, in conjunction with \nJMDRC, will provide interpreters, local transportation, and office space in Jincheng equipped \nwith suitable facilities. Computers and other office equipment to be financed under the TA will \nbe  procured  by  the  international  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation Fund for Poverty Reduction in Coal Mine Areas in Shanxi Province, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n9  SDRC is the most important agency of the Shanxi provincial government in promoting development and reforms in \nShanxi province. \n10  In addition, the consultants will provide two international specialist trainers in development of livelihood projects for \n2 person-weeks each to assist with the preparation of training programs and initiate the same under phases III and \nIV of the TA . \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nItem  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n       \nGoal       \n       \nReemployment of miners made  \u2022  Number of redundant  \u2022  Country    \nredundant by closure of small coal  mine workers  economic \nmines in sustainable jobs in the  participate in training  and coal \nsouthern part of Shanxi province   programs in the  mining sector \nsouthern part of  statistics \nShanxi province  \u2022  Policy \n\u2022  Reemployment of 20%  dialogue with \nof redundant mine  the \nworkers due to small- Government \nscale coal mine  \u2022  Implementati\nclosure southern part  on monitoring \nof Shanxi province by  by SPG and \nthe end of 2006   ADB \n \n       \nPurpose       \n       \n1.
