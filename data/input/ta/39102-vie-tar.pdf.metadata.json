The Government of Viet Nam has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to strengthen its Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regime. A decree on \nmoney laundering drafted with TA provided as part of the ADB TA project 4035-VIE: Capacity \nBuilding for Non-Bank Financial Institutions and Capital Markets, was approved and issued on 6 \nJune 2005 and became effective on 1 August 2005. Implementation of the decree to prevent \nand combat money laundering will require extensive training of staff in a number of government \nagencies  and  financial  institutions.  The  request  for  this  TA  was  made  to  the  Country \nProgramming Mission in 2005, and the Viet Nam County Strategy and Program 2004\u20132006 \nincludes financial and corporate governance as a strategic sector in ADB\u2019s assistance program. \nThe TA is in line with ADB\u2019s policy of enhancing ADB\u2019s role in combating money laundering and \nthe financing of terrorism.1 A TA Fact-finding Mission visited Viet Nam in May 2005 and had \ndetailed consultations with the key stakeholders and the Government. This report reflects the \nfindings of the Mission and the understanding reached with the Government on objectives, \nscope, cost, and implementation arrangements for the TA.2 The TA design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Money laundering became a criminal offence in Viet Nam when Article 251 was included \nin the Criminal Code. In 2002 the Government of Viet Nam decided to prepare a basis for \ngovernment agencies to prevent and combat money laundering and advised the State Bank of \nVietnam (SBV) to develop a draft decree in consultation with all relevant government agencies. \nDecree 74/2005/ND-CP was signed by the Prime Minister on 6 June 2005 and took effect on 1 \nAugust 2005.  \n \n3.  The Decree applies to all Vietnamese and foreign institutions, nationals and foreigners \ncarrying out economic, financial, or monetary activities in Viet Nam. It requires all financial \ninstitutions,  including  banks,  entities  providing  credit;  brokers;  payment  services;  securities \ntraders; traders in gold, silver, and gemstones; insurance companies; casinos; and foreign \nfinancial institutions to take action to prevent and combat money laundering. In particular they \nmust (i) develop AML plans, (ii) establish internal control and audit procedures, (ii) appoint \nspecialized staff to undertake AML activities, (iii) develop and implement customer due diligence \nand know-your-customer (KYC) policies, (iv) keep records for a period of at least 5 years, (v) \nidentify and report both high-value and suspicious transactions to the Anti-Money Laundering \nInformation Center (AMLIC the financial intelligence unit) required to be established within SBV \nunder the Decree, (vi) train staff in applying the Decree and the internal AML policies of the \ninstitution, and (vii) take appropriate measures to prevent money laundering activity where this \nis identified.  \n \n4.  The Decree does not have a provision to deal with combating terrorist financing (CTF). \nThe reasons for not including CTF in the decree are as follows: (i) the Government\u2019s request to \nSBV to draft a decree was limited to an AML decree that drew its primary authority from the Law \non the State Bank of Vietnam dated 12 December 1997 (as amended on 17 June 2003) and the \nLaw on Credit Institutions dated 12 December 1997; (ii) terrorism is an offence under the \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003. Enhancing the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Role in Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism. Manila. \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 27 July 2005. \n ", " 2   \nVietnamese Criminal Code, which together with the range of associated offences such as \ncomplicity,  preparation  to  commit  an  offence,  harboring  of  offenders,  and  failure  to  report \ncriminal behavior, provides a range of laws that could be used to deal with terrorist financing; \n(iii) under Vietnamese law, a decree cannot create criminal offences, which need  substantive \nlaws to be passed by the National Assembly. Accordingly the AML decree could not create new \ncriminal offences relating to failure to report suspected terrorist financing or terrorist financing \nitself; and (iv) Viet Nam has filed three reports with the United Nations on its compliance with \nSecurity Council Resolution 13733. Viet Nam is aware that it needs to amend its Criminal Code \nto  create  expanded  terrorism  offences;  a  Decree  cannot  create  offences.  Finally,  the \nGovernment is currently looking at the terrorism issue and its international obligations through a \nseparate track under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) and Ministry of Public \nSecurity's (MPS) Criminal Code.  \n \n5.   The  Decree  sets  out  the  particular  responsibilities  of  SBV,  MPS,  and  specialized \ninspectors to prevent and combat money laundering. SBV will be responsible for developing a \npolicy and guidelines for the operation of the decree, reporting to the Government on the \noperation  of  the  decree  and  receiving,  analyzing,  and  disseminating  financial  intelligence \ncollected in accordance with the decree.  MPS is the leading agency involved in investigating \nmoney laundering. \n \n6.   All government agencies involved in AML activities and the financial institutions will need \ngeneral AML education. Such education covers basic concepts and issues. What is money \nlaundering? What are suspicious transactions? How do money launderers operate? What are \nthe obligations of financial institutions? The amount of Euro430,000 is available under co-\nfinancing arrangements from Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) under the Financial \nSector Program Loan (FSPL) II Subprogram II4 to help AMLIC invest in equipment and physical \ninfrastructure. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has produced a series \nof computer-based training programs providing basic AML material. These are suitable for staff \nin AMLIC, investigative and enforcement agencies, compliance and regulatory agencies, and \nfinancial institutions. AMLIC will need training in information management, analyzing financial \nintelligence, investigating financial transactions, operating information technology (IT) systems \nto collect and analyze financial intelligence, and helping financial institutions to meet their \nobligations under the Decree. The SBV staff involved in compliance activities will need to \nensure  that  financial  institutions  meet  their  obligations  under  the  Decree.  The  Ministry  of \nFinance (MOF) and the State Securities Commission (SSC), as regulators of the insurance and \nsecurities industries, will have similar needs for compliance training. With the obligations under \nthe  Decree  extending  to  agencies  beyond  those  coming  under  the  definition  of  financial \n \ninstitutions, these regulatory bodies will also have reporting and other AML responsibilities.\n \n7.   Agencies such as MPS, Standing Office of Drug Control, and customs authorities will \nneed  training  in  how  to  investigate  financial  crimes,  particularly  money  laundering,  using \nfinancial intelligence provided by AMLIC. Based on other-country experience, this will probably \ninvolve both investigative skills training and financial crime investigation. In addition, prosecuting \nmoney laundering cases involves special skills and knowledge. Training for the prosecutors will \nalso be needed. Some limited judicial training will be provided by the Asia Europe Meeting \n                                                 \n3 Resolution 1373 sets out the measures that each country must  now take to prevent and combat terrorists wherever  \nthey are found \n4 ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n \n ", "      3\n \nproject and it will be ideal for Viet Nam to have some of its judges sent to this course. Financial \ninstitutions will need extensive training in the operation of the Decree, in particular, in the areas \nof customer identification, KYC, record keeping, suspicious transaction reporting, and currency \ntransaction reporting.  \n \n8.  Specialized capacity will have to be built across a wide range of institutions to implement \nthe Decree effectively. Support will need to be particularly intensive in the case of AMLIC, where \nprior operational experience does not exist domestically. A successful outcome will require the \nsustained  involvement  and  support  of  a  wide  range  of  government  agencies,  industry \nassociations, and other constituencies. \n \n9.  Viet  Nam  is  a  signatory  to  and  has  acceded  to  the  1988  United  Nations  Vienna \nConvention against illicit traffic in Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic substances and the 1999 \nTerrorist Financing International Convention for the suppression of financing of terrorism. It has \nalso  signed,  but  has  not  yet  ratified,  the  United  Nations  Palermo  Convention  against \ntransnational  organized  crime.  SBV  representatives  attended  the  2003  and  2004  annual \nmeeting  of  the  Asia/Pacific  Group  (APG)  on  money  laundering.  One  of  the  first-tranche \nconditions under the Financial Sector Prorgram Loan II Subprogram II is for Viet Nam to join an \ninternational  organization  for  AML  activities  at  least  for  observer  member  status.  A  draft \nproposal for joining APG is being considered by SBV.  \n \nIII.     THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The objective of the TA is to strengthen the AML regime and combat money laundering \neffectively to strengthen the financial system and governance in Viet Nam. The TA will assist the \nGovernment  of  Viet  Nam  in  implementing  the  Decree  to  Prevent  and  Combat  Money \nLaundering through awareness education, policy development and institutional building, and \nenhancing operational activities of SBV and other agencies concerned. The major outputs \nexpected  from  the  TA  are  (i)  enhanced  awareness  and  understanding  about  AML  in  key \nagencies and the public, (ii) strengthened institutional and policy framework, and (iii) enhanced \noperational capacity for investigation and compliance among key institutions. \n \nB.    Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  Essentially  the  TA  falls  into  three  broad  areas:  (i)  awareness  education,  (ii)  policy \ndevelopment and institution building, and (iii) operational activities.  \n \n1.  Awareness Education  \n12.  Awareness  Within  Government.  Understanding  about  AML  and  terrorist  financing \nissues within government agencies in Viet Nam is at low level. General awareness training \ncovering the nature of the issues, international developments, identifying methodologies, and \noutlining the decree and its main elements, will be provided to key agencies such as SBV, MOF, \nMOJ, MPS, and SSC. \n \n13.  Public  Awareness  Campaign.  Public  awareness  campaigns  will  be  conducted  to \nexplain why money laundering is a problem and to describe the responses that are being put in \nplace. They will deal in particular with the difference between the use of cash, even in high ", " 4   \nvolumes (and value), for legitimate and money laundering purposes, and will include mass \nmedia activities to disseminate knowledge and enhance awareness. \n \n2.  Policy Development and Institution Building  \n \n13.  The issuance of the decree will in effect see effort transferred to the development of \nregulations and instructions to deal with a number of issues the decree addressed only in \ngeneral  terms.  The  TA  will  assist  in  developing  reporting  forms  and  processes,  and \nadministrative rules relating to the operation of AMLIC; determining the extent to which reporting \nwill be done electronically; starting internal training for AMLIC on its basic role and operation-\nand developing instructions and directives to be provided to financial institutions. An IT system \nfor AMLIC will be designed and developed  with assistance from AFD (para. 6). \n \n14.  In addition, the TA will assist in developing knowledge and training for the staff of SBV, \nMOF, MPS, MOJ, and SSC on money laundering issues so that they can develop a range of \ncomplementary policy responses. Financial institutions will be assisted in developing internal \nprocedures  and  regulations  on  AML.  The  possibility  of  developing  a  pairing/mentoring \nrelationship between AMLIC and other well-established regional AMLIC will also be explored. \n  \n3.  Operational Activities \n15.  The  needs  here  fall  into  two  broad  areas.  The  first  concerns  the  need  to  train \ninvestigators who will have involvement in AML cases. Second, there is the issue of compliance \neducation for the regulatory agencies, SBV, MOF, and SSC. Training will be conducted, where \nappropriate, by consultants engaged under the TA, but additional resource persons may also be \nbrought  in,  as  necessary,  to  conduct  targeted  workshops  on  special  areas.  The  training \nprograms will be designed and implemented in close consultation, wherever possible, with \nexisting training institutions. \na.     Investigative Training \n \n16.  Training will be provided in each agency that has an enforcement role and will cover the \nfollowing areas: (i) planning investigations; (ii) interview techniques; (iii) evidence gathering; (iv) \ncovert investigations; (v) forensic accounting; (vi) financial system awareness; (vii) asset tracing; \n(viii) use of IT tools; and (ix) international issues such as mutual legal assistance, foreign \nevidence, and extradition.  \n \n17.  A  general  investigator  program  with  a  specific  money  laundering  focus  built  on \ncomponents that could be tailored to suit each participant will be developed, based on models \nthat will provide an intensive course over a 4-week period. At a second level, those who must \nrun investigations will also need training. Training will focus on managing the investigation of a \ncomplex crime. In addition, courses in forensic accounting and asset tracing and management \nwill be developed and delivered separately.  \n \n    b.     Compliance Training  \n \n18.  Each regulatory agency in the financial sector has extensive compliance and policy \nfunctions. These agencies\u2014SBV, MOF, and SSC\u2014will be required to ensure compliance with \nthe  AML  decree  by  financial  institutions  within  their  regulatory  spheres.  The  agencies  will \nreceive training in regulatory practices and methodologies in addition to any specific money \nlaundering-related training. Training will also be provided through workshops for prosecutors ", "      5\n \nwho will conduct money laundering prosecutions. Their needs include an understanding of \nmoney laundering methods, the particular difficulties of prosecuting money laundering and a \ngeneral appreciation of more complex financial transactions. The prosecutors will be included in \nother training conducted by financial institutions or law enforcement agencies. The study tour to \nregional countries organized in close consultation with the APG on money laundering will train \nstaff and key officials on AML skills through visits to jurisdictions where such AML units are \ncurrently in operation. In the study tour component, placing AMLIC staff in well run FIUs and \nother areas of AML/CTF activity such as investigative agencies in the region will also be \nexplored.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $630,000  equivalent,  comprising  foreign  exchange  of \n$420,000 and a local currency equivalent of $210,000. The Government has requested ADB to \nprovide  $500,000  to  finance  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $420,000  and  $80,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan and administered by ADB. The Government \nwill provide the remaining $130,000 equivalent by providing counterpart staff and other support \nfacilities. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  SBV will be the Executing Agency for the TA. It will establish an interagency national \ncoordination committee comprising representatives from each of the implementing agencies \n(MOF,  MOJ,  MPS,  and  SSC)  that  will  enable  them  to  cooperate  and,  where  appropriate, \ncoordinate domestically with each other concerning the development and implementation of \npolicies and activities to combat money laundering. The TA will be implemented over 12 months \nfrom  end-November  2005  to  October  2006.  The  TA  will  require  consulting  services  of  10 \nperson-months (international) and 2.5 months (domestic).  There will be three international AML \nexperts and one domestic consultant who will assist in organizing workshops and training at \nrequired centers as well for translation. As noted in para. 16, additional resource persons may \nbe brought in to conduct targeted workshops on special areas. The terms of reference for the \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. ADB will engage an international consulting firm, using biodata \ntechnical  proposals  under  the  quality-based  selection  method  (in  view  of  the  specialized \nexpertise required for the project), in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Recruitment of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to  ADB for engaging of consultants. The \nconsulting firm will coordinate with SBV to jointly conduct the education seminars. SBV will also \nprovide counterpart staff and office accommodation. In addition to giving weekly briefings to \nSBV, the consultants will submit an inception report within 2 weeks of TA commencement and \nan interim report and draft final report in accordance with schedules to be agreed upon with \nADB  and  SBV.  Tripartite  reviews  will  be  conducted  by  ADB,  the  Government,  and  the \nconsultants to consider the reports. TA results will be distributed through the SBV, MOF, and \nADB websites. The consultants will also coordinate with other aid agencies working in the area \nof AML, including the training being undertaken by the World Bank Institute. \n \nIV.     THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Viet Nam, for Support to Implement the Anti-Money Laundering Decree, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.
