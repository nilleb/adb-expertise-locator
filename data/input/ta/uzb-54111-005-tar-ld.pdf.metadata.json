Women occupy only 12% of the \nsector\u2019s workforce. Access to transportation is also a necessity for women in performing care \nwork  that  includes  transporting  children  to  schools  and  the  elderly  to  healthcare  facilities. \nHowever, they are less likely to own or drive private vehicles, hence, access to efficient and safe \npublic transportation is important for women. \n \nThe  project\u2019s targeted outcome is improved railway services for freight and  passengers  in \nWestern Uzbekistan. It consists of two outputs: (i) the upgrading of railway infrastructure along \nthe Bukhara\u2013Miskin\u2013Urgench\u2013Khiva line and (ii) development of tourism corridor Bukhara\u2013\nMiskin\u2013Urgench\u2013Khiva. The project is expected to expand benefits to women as commuters in \nterms of more frequent, efficient, and fast train journeys and low-cost tickets. Moreover, women \nstaff of the executing agency will benefit from technical trainings in operation and maintenance \nand training in tourism promotion and marketing.  \n \nThe subproject will contribute to and maximize the positive impact of the ensuing project on \nwomen. It will build the capacities of  women from the communities in the project area, particularly, \n(i) female students of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and TVET courses to \nhelp them meet skills requirements for railway operations and management and (ii) women in \ncommunities engaged in  the tourism and hospitality industry. \n \nThe subproject will help enhance the employability of training of female STEM and TVET students \nin technical positions by providing training on railway technology and management. The trainings \nwill be designed based on the assessment of the curricula and content of STEM courses vis-\u00e0-\nvis the skills requirements of UTY. The modules may also be utilized in the capacity building \nactivities for UTY staff on railway operation and maintenance, as appropriate. The subproject will \nsupport women\u2019s participation in the tourism and hospitality industry by providing women from the \ncommunities with trainings in tourism and hospitality-related learning programs and accreditation, \nas needed. Women who are currently working in or operating enterprises in the industry will be \ngiven priority for the trainings.   \n \nScope of Services: \nADB seeks a consulting firm to carry out the subproject.  The firm should have a solid capacity to \ncarry out a gender diagnostic of the transport sector, develop a marketing campaign to attract \nmore female students to train for technical jobs, and manage the conduct of training courses for \nstudents and community members.
