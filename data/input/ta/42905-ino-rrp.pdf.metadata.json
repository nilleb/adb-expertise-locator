I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Bank Mandiri (Persero) (Mandiri) of up to $300 million of which (i) up to $75 million (the A \nloan) is funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and (ii) up to $225 million (the B loan) is \nfunded by commercial banks under participation agreements between ADB and such banks. \nThe design and monitoring framework for the proposed investment is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nI.  RATIONALE: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Indonesian Economy \n2.  Economic Assessment.1 Indonesia, one of the world\u2019s most important countries in \nterms of biodiversity, has experienced extraordinary changes in the past 15 years. Following \nrapid  economic  growth  and  declining  poverty  in  the  early  1990s,  the  country witnessed  a \nsudden deterioration of its gross domestic product (GDP) and heightened poverty in 1997\u20132000 \ndue  to  the  Asian  financial  crisis.  The  crisis  exposed  key  issues  related  to  the  lack  of \ncoordination between levels of government, as well as endemic corruption. Subsequently, a \nstrong focus on maintaining macroeconomic stability and a conservative fiscal policy helped the \ncountry gradually overcome some of the economic, political, and social shocks. Growth has \nbeen moderate and poverty incidence has declined. \n \n3.  Indonesia is now at a critical stage as recovery efforts must also aim to achieve annual \ngrowth rates of about 7% in order to create jobs needed to mitigate the unemployment rate of \n10.4%. To meet this target, much-needed reforms must continue to encourage greater private \nsector participation by improving the investment climate and developing a more responsive and \nsupportive finance sector. Moreover, the country needs to boost its development spending in a \nmanner that would support attainment of the Millennium Development Goals; progress has been \nmixed with many regions lagging.  \n \n4.  Economic Outlook and Challenges. Indonesia\u2019s economic growth accelerated to 6.3% \nin 2007, above its 5-year average of 5.5%\u2014the best growth rate since 1996. The main drivers \nof growth were private consumption, supported by private investment and an expansion of net \nexports. Year-on-year inflation declined from a peak of 18.4% in late 2005 to 6.6% at the end of \n2007, as the impact of a 126% rise in fuel prices in October 2005 faded. Amid some volatility, \ninflation averaged 6.4%\u2014within Bank Indonesia\u2019s target range of 5%\u20137%. While movements in \nfood prices and seasonal factors contributed much to the volatility, a combination of factors \nranging from higher global nonfood commodity prices, the depreciating rupiah, and a steady \nincrease in domestic demand kept inflation from declining further.  \n \n5.  Private sector credit growth quickened, reflecting a reduction in interest rates. With the \neasing of inflationary pressures, Bank Indonesia cut its policy rate from 12.75% in April 2006 to \n8.0% in December 2007. This led to a corresponding reduction in commercial bank rates and a \nrecovery  in  bank  credit,  which  increased  by  25.5%  year-on-year  in  December  2007.  The \nstronger growth in lending helped lift bank profits. Although GDP2 growth is forecast at 6.1% in \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program: Indonesia 2006\u20132009. Manila.   \n2  Indonesia\u2019s nominal GDP in 2006 was approximately $364 billion. \n ", "2   \n2008, down slightly from 2007, cheaper borrowing costs, a new investment law,3 efforts to \nencourage infrastructure investment, and various new guidelines introduced by Bank Indonesia \nto stimulate bank lending continue to create opportunities for growth. The main drivers in recent \ngrowth  are  private  consumption,  a  recovery  in  private  investment,  and  solid  expansion  of \nexports. The forecast slowdown is essentially the result of weakness in the global economy.  \n \n6.  The strengthened economic fundamentals and yield differentials attracted significant \nforeign portfolio inflows during the first half of 2007, before international investors turned more \nrisk averse after the subprime credit problems in the United States. After experienced a sharp \ndownturn during July\u2013August, the Jakarta Stock Exchange rebounded, and more than regained \nlost ground during the rest of the year. By the end of 2007, the exchange\u2019s composite index was \n52% higher than a year earlier. The rupiah depreciated by 4.4% against the dollar in 2007, \ndespite  strong  growth  in  international  reserves.  This  growth  is  partly  attributed  to  reserve \nmanagement  arrangements,  whereby  inflows  of  foreign  exchange  from  oil  revenues  and \nroyalties automatically accumulate as Bank Indonesia reserves, while Pertamina (the state-\nowned oil company) buys dollars in the market to purchase oil imports. \n \n7.  The  relatively  moderate  impact  of  the  United  States  subprime  crisis  on  domestic \nfinancial markets, together with an improved policy environment, led to Standard and Poor\u2019s \n(S&P) raising the country\u2019s sovereign foreign currency debt rating to BB\u2013 and Moody\u2019s rating it \nBa3 in 2007. \n \n8.  Indonesia\u2019s concerns are no longer dominated by economic stabilization and recovery, \nbut rather of achieving and sustaining higher growth rates to reduce unemployment, poverty, \nand overall vulnerability. Complemented by a relatively young population, the country displays \nimmense economic potential that could lead to higher demand for consumer spending and \nbanking services. The Government of Indonesia is pursuing a progrowth agenda while pushing \nforward broad, structural, and institutional reforms. \n \n9.  Economic growth-related constraints include a narrow and shallow finance sector, poor \ninfrastructure,  and  an  adverse  investment  climate.  Deepening  of  the  finance  sector  is  a \nprerequisite for long-term development of the infrastructure sector and sustained growth. The \nreliance of most businesses on direct bank lending limits investment possibilities and does not \nencourage good governance. The Government recognizes that expansion of infrastructure is \nrequired to increase service coverage, remove bottlenecks, and attract investments that would \nhelp achieve and sustain projected economic growth.  \n \nB.  Indonesian Banking Subsector \n10.  Banking Subsector Composition. The finance sector continues to be dominated by \nbanks, which in 2007 accounted for about 80% of the sector\u2019s assets. The country has 129 \nbanks: 5 state-owned banks, 82 private commercial banks, 26 regional development banks, and \n16 joint venture banks. Despite a reduction in the number of banks from 222 banks in 1997, the \nbanking subsector is still overcrowded and fragmented. Many small banks are undercapitalized \nand have very limited businesses, with several others having ceased operation. Twenty-four \nbanks have a capital base of less than Rp100 billion, 100 banks have from Rp100 billion to \n                                                 \n3  The new investment law released in March 2007\u2014UU Penanaman Modal 2007\u2014aims to reinvigorate investment \nin the Indonesian economy, create jobs, and reduce poverty. In the Indonesian Global Investment Forum in New \nYork, the President argued that the country needed to attract investors in order to create jobs and halve the poverty \nrate by 2009. He said Indonesia needed $426 billion of investments to make the 6.6% growth target possible each \nyear until 2009. ", "                      3 \nRp10 trillion in capital, and only 5 banks have capital greater than Rp10 trillion. Indonesia\u2018s \nlargest bank is only the eighth largest in Southeast Asia. To create a sound and efficient \nbanking structure, the regulators plan to reduce the number of banks by imposing a higher \nminimum capital requirement. \n \n11.  Policies, Regulations, and Strengthening of the System. Finance sector regulation \nand supervision are under the authority of two main supervisory authorities. Bank Indonesia \nregulates  and  supervises  banks.  In  the  aftermath  of  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  it  received \nsignificant strengthening and was given financial autonomy. The 1999 Central Bank Law has \ntransformed  Bank  Indonesia  into  an  independent  central  bank  free  from  government \nintervention  or  any  other  parties.  The  law,  amended  in  2005,  proposes  to  establish  a \nconsolidated  supervisory  authority  for  financial  services  in  2010.  The  Capital  Markets \nSupervisory Agency (BAPEPAM) regulates and supervises the capital markets. It has limited \npowers and reports to the Ministry of Finance, which is responsible for high-level policy matters.  \n \n12.  Bank  Indonesia  is  seeking  to  promote  consolidation  and  strengthen  capitalization \nthrough a policy framework\u2014the Indonesian Banking Architecture. The framework includes new \ncapital tiers for banks that wish to operate internationally, nationally, or regionally. The new rule \nthat  imposes  a  minimum  capital  requirement  of  Rp100  billion  will  significantly  reduce  the \nnumber of banks. Several banks have already merged or were acquired by larger institutions \nthis year. The framework also aims to improve regulatory standards based on international best \npractices  by  phasing  in  Basel  core  principles  of  effective  banking  supervision.  The  strict \nenforcement of prudential rules, the need for internal control systems, and Bank Indonesia\u2019s \npolicies are likely to strengthen banking.  \n \n13.  In addition, Bank Indonesia\u2019s single presence policy, which will be effective in 2010, \nlimits the controlling majority (25% ownership or indirect control) from having a controlling stake \nin more than one bank. Those with multiple stakes will need to divest, establish a banking \nholding company, or merge their bank interests in Indonesia. Under the Indonesian Banking \nArchitecture, the regulators aim to ultimately reduce the number of banks to 50\u201360 from the \ncurrent base of 129.4  \n \n14.  Banking  Performance.  The  overall  performance  of  banks  in  2007  was  positive, \nsupported by favorable economic conditions. Bank Indonesia\u2019s key interest rate dropped from \n12.75 % at the end of 2005 to 8.25% by the end of October 2007, but was raised in May 2008 to \n8.5% to ease inflationary pressure from the 27% average increase in fuel price. In May 2008, \nyear-on-year inflation was 10.3%. Although this rate is hoped to recede to approximately 7% by \nthe end of 2008, the impact of increasing fuel and food prices will prove challenging in curbing \ninflationary pressures.5 The lowering of the Bank Indonesia rate has led to a recovery in credit \ngrowth. However, as a reaction to the Asian financial crisis in 1997, banks are more risk \nadverse in lending to corporate customers and more inclined to keep funding in Government \nbonds or consumer lending. Consumer loans account for 50% of all loans, while working capital \naccounts for 40% and term loans 10%.  \n \n15.  At the end of July 2007, net nonperforming loans (NPLs) made up 3.0% of the banks\u2019 \nloan portfolio down from a peak of 48% in 1998. The asset quality of commercial banks has \nrecovered. The Government recently introduced regulations providing more flexibility for state \n                                                 \n4  Fitch. 2007. Indonesian Banks. Jakarta. \n5  Prices of rice, Indonesia\u2019s staple food, are reported to have increased approximately 26% from the first quarter of \n2007 to the first quarter of 2008. \n ", "4   \nbanks to write off their bad debts, so the NPLs of state banks are expected to decline. Banks \nremain well capitalized, with a capital adequacy ratio of 20.5%, well above the prescribed norm \nof 8%. With respect to foreign currency, access for private enterprises was drastically reduced \nduring the Asian financial crisis. In particular, long-term funds in foreign exchange available for \nlending decreased and have not yet recovered. Foreign exchange to local banks from the \ninternational  market  has  gradually  become  more  available  at  lower  and  more  competitive \ninterest rates; however, these funds are only suitable for short-term lending. \n \n16.  Privatization.  After  recapitalizing  and  restructuring  the  ailing  major  banks,  the \nGovernment began to privatize them to create a more competitive banking landscape and to \nraise state revenues. The privatization aims to improve the performance and value of the banks; \nand to widen the investor base targeting institutional investors, portfolio managers, and existing \nowners seeking to raise their stakes. The sale of the Government\u2019s stake in the major banks \nwas successful with international investors indicating strong interest. Fifteen banks representing \nmore than 70% of the country\u2019s bank assets have been privatized. The Government divested its \nstake in nine private banks to foreign investors as controlling shareholders. Total assets of \nthese foreign-owned banks have reached 42% of the total industry assets.  \n \n17.  The Government has also started to partially privatize state-owned banks as part of an \neffort to sell off its holdings in selected state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The Government \npartially sold its stake in Mandiri to the public in 2003 and 2004. As a listed company, the \nregulations of the Capital Market Supervisory Agency require greater supervision, transparent \nreporting, nomination of independent accountants, and establishment of an audit committee. \nThis  enhanced  supervision  combined  with  greater  assertiveness  of  public  shareholders  in \nexercising their rights have proven to be quite effective in making Mandiri more transparent, \naccountable, and commercially operated.  \n \n18.  Long-Term  Financing.  Despite  recent  improvements,  the  Indonesian  banking \nsubsector  is  not  a  source  of  long-term  funding.  As  of  December  2005,  Indonesian  banks \ncontrolled Rp1.47 trillion in assets (more than 50% of GDP). However, similar to the banks in \nmany countries in the region, Indonesian banks obtain most of their funding from short-term \ndeposits.6 Accordingly, Indonesian banks have difficulty offering loans that match the life of a \nborrower\u2019s investment and expenditure requirements without taking a significant asset\u2013liability \nmaturity mismatch.  \n \n19.  In  the  Indonesian  market,  demand  for  long-tenor  dollar  borrowing  to  finance \ninfrastructure-related projects is substantial as many such projects generate dollar revenues. In \nthe mid-1990s, private investment commitments in any given year averaged 30%\u201340% of the \nGovernment\u2019s development spending on infrastructure, or nearly 2% of GDP. In 2003 and 2004, \nprivate investment fell to less than 25% of Government spending, or just 0.4% of GDP. The \nWorld Bank estimates that Indonesia needs to increase its lending to infrastructure by about 2% \nof GDP, or $5 billion per year, if the Government is to reach its 6% per year targeted medium-\nterm  economic  growth.  The  most  significant  bottleneck  to  meeting  the  investment  in \ninfrastructure required for sustainable economic growth is the inability of the Indonesian finance \nsector to access long-term financing. \n \n                                                 \n6  More than 80% of Mandiri\u2019s funding is by way of deposits of 1 month or less. ", "                      5 \nC.  Loan Rationale \n20.  Given  the  significant  long-term  financing  requirement  in  Indonesia  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment and other capital expenditure, and the severe limitations of the local financial \nmarket, Mandiri\u2019s role as the country\u2019s largest financial institution continues to be of critical \nimportance. Mandiri has undergone significant reform of its finances and operations since its \nestablishment as a result of the Asian financial crisis. However, the ability of Mandiri to provide \nmuch needed long-term funding is severely constrained by Mandiri\u2019s maturity mismatch in its \nassets and liabilities, and the unavailability of long-term financing to address this mismatch. The \nlonger-tenor funding required is not available in the market without ADB support, and will greatly \nassist in improving the maturity profile of Mandiri\u2019s balance sheet. Further, the B loan will \nestablish Mandiri\u2019s relationship with international commercial banks, thereby fulfilling the vital \nrole of facilitating avenues for future fund raising.   \n \n \nII.  THE BORROWER \n21.  Mandiri is the largest bank in Indonesia in terms of total assets, loans, and deposits \n(based on financial statistics reported by Bank Indonesia as of 31 December 2007) and one of \nthe leading banking and financial services providers in Indonesia. Mandiri is majority-owned by \nthe  Government.  As  of  31  December  2007,  Mandiri  had  Rp319.1  trillion  in  total  assets,  \nRp125.5 trillion in total consolidated loans, and Rp253.8 trillion in consolidated total deposits.  \n \n22.  Mandiri was established in October 1998, and following the merger in July 1999 with four \nstate-owned banks\u2014Bank Bumi Daya (Persero), Bank Dagang Negara (Persero), Bank Ekspor \nImpor  Indonesia  (Persero),  and  Bank  Pembangunan  Indonesia  (Persero)\u2014it  commenced \noperations in August 1999. \n \n23.  Mandiri completed its initial public offering in July 2003. The Government followed this \nby divesting 20% of its shares in Mandiri. Mandiri is currently listed on the Jakarta Stock \nExchange  and  Surabaya  Stock  Exchange.  In  March  2004,  the  Government  divested  an \nadditional 10% of its shares in Mandiri through a secondary offering.   \n \n24.  Mandiri has 14 subsidiaries. The Mandiri Group\u2019s principal activities include providing \ngeneral banking services including activities based on sharia principles. The group carries out \ncommercial banking, corporate banking, consumer banking, and treasury activities. One of its \nsubsidiaries,  Mandiri  Sekuritas,  is  the  largest  and  best-capitalized  investment  bank  and \nsecurities firm in Indonesia. The subsidiaries are an amalgamation of companies originally \nowned by the four merged banks. Mandiri continues to evaluate subsidiaries\u2019 activities with the \nintention of divesting those that do not fit with its main business lines in corporate, retail, sharia, \nand investment banking.  \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE  \nA.  Proposed Investment \n25.  The proposed loan to Mandiri is for up to $75,000,000 without a government guarantee \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. It will have a term of up to 7 years and other such terms \nand conditions set forth in this report.  \n \n ", "6   \n26.  The proposed long-term dollar financing will assist Mandiri in two core areas. It will assist \nin improving the funding structure problems currently stemming from the large asset\u2013liability \nmaturity mismatch. In addition, it will enable Mandiri to support and expand its long-term dollar \nloan portfolio, which consists primarily of customers seeking financing to invest in long-term \nprojects, such as infrastructure-related activities.  \n \nB.  Social and Environmental Safeguard Issues  \n27.  The  investment  is  classified  FI  under  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  ADB  has \nadvised  Mandiri  on  its  safeguard  policies,  and  discussed  their  relevance  and  importance. \nMandiri will be required to comply with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy as applicable to FI and \nnonsovereign operations. Mandiri will be required to adopt an appropriate environmental and \nsocial management system (ESMS) and build capacity in environmental and social impact \nassessment and management where appropriate.  \n  \n28.  As a corporate loan, the investment does not involve any identified projects requiring \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  is  not  expected  to  adversely  affect  indigenous  peoples.  It  is \ntherefore assigned category C with regard to The Bank\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) \nand the policy relating to Involuntary Resettlement (1995). \n \nC.  Anticorruption Policy and Policy Relating to the Combating of Money Laundering \nand the Financing of Terrorism  \n29.  Mandiri was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and \npolicy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire Mandiri to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging  in  such  activities.  The  investment  documentation  between  ADB  and  Mandiri  will \nfurther allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings.  \n \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS AND ASSUMPTIONS \n1.  Objectives and Outcome \n30.  The loan merits ADB support for the following reasons: \n \n(i)  The loan provides support to Mandiri as it continues to strengthen its financial \nposition and undertake further financial reform. The loan will assist Mandiri to \naddress the severe asset\u2013liability mismatch that dominates Mandiri\u2019s balance \nsheet and exposes Mandiri to significant liquidity risk. Financial institutions such \nas Mandiri will play a critical role in strengthening Indonesia\u2019s finance sector and \nin providing much needed long-term funding in Indonesia. \n(ii)  The  loan  will  improve  Mandiri\u2019s  ability  to  lend  long-term  foreign  currency  to \nborrowers involved in various long-term projects across Indonesia and enable \nbetter matching of cash flows, thus stabilizing economics for the end borrower. \nLong-tenor funding is required to help Indonesia meet infrastructure development \nrequirements essential for sustained economic growth.  ", "                      7 \n(iii)  The  loan  supports  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  of  encouraging  private  sector \nparticipation in capital investment, given the large financial outlays required and \nlimited public sector financing available.  \n(iv)  Through the loan, ADB will guide the development and institutionalization of \nMandiri\u2019s  ESMS  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard policies in its transactions.  \n(v)  The loan is likely to catalyze commercial bank participation. Long-term debt has \nalready been verbally committed by reputable international banks under ADB\u2019s B \nloan program. This is likely to facilitate Mandiri\u2019s access to longer-term funding \nfrom similar institutions.  \n(vi)  ADB  assistance  to  Mandiri  will  be  the  first  from  a  multilateral  development \nagency  without  sovereign  guarantee,  and  will  be  viewed  by  the  market  as \nsupporting Mandiri as it undertakes reform measures. These reforms are in line \nwith the Government\u2019s ongoing efforts to restructure state-owned banks and with \nBank Indonesia\u2019s program to strengthen banking in Indonesia. \n \n2.  Development Impact and Effectiveness \n31.  The  development  impact  assessment  of  a  financial  intermediary,  including  Mandiri, \nbegins by acknowledging the well-established thesis that a healthy finance sector, populated by \nhealthy  financial  institutions,  promotes  sustainable  economic  growth,  helps  generate \nemployment, and ultimately reduces poverty. Therefore, the ability of a financial intermediary, in \nthis  case  Mandiri,  to  positively  impact  development  depends  on  various  indicators  of  its \nstrength, through both qualitative and quantitative measures, as well as broader impact beyond \nMandiri itself.  \n \n32.  Development  indicators  can  be  categorized  along  two  key  parameters  within  the \nproject\u2019s impact on private sector development via (i) project (direct) company impact that the \nproject delivers to and/or by Mandiri; and (ii) beyond (indirect) company impact to the wider \nsector and/or economy outside the specific activities of Mandiri.  \n  \n3.  Fit to Sector and Country Strategy \n33.  Due to budgetary constraints, the Government has had difficulty providing the required \ninfrastructure investment from its own funds. It has therefore launched an infrastructure reform \nprogram supported by ADB and other development partners to regain the confidence of private \nsector investors, and to mobilize their resources to fill the gap resulting from the sharp decline in \ninfrastructure investment. The assistance to Mandiri will help provide the funding needed to \nsupport  the  Government\u2019s  efforts.  The  Government  continues  to  undertake  regulatory, \nstructural, and policy changes in an effort to prepare sector ministries, local governments, and \nSOEs for greater private sector involvement in infrastructure. \n \n34.  ADB will engage the Government in five areas of operations derived from the analysis of \nconstraints on development. The expected outcomes include \n \n(i)  improved infrastructure and infrastructure services, including rural infrastructure, \nwith  increased  public  and  private  sector  investment  and  improved  sector \nregulation as indicators; \n(ii)  deepened finance sector with improved domestic resource mobilization to meet \nlong-term financing needs as the indicator; \n ", "8   \n(iii)  improved  decentralization  with  increased  regional  spending  and  enhanced \nfinancial reporting as indicators; \n(iv)  accelerated Millennium Development Goal achievement with better water supply \nand sanitation, health, and education indicators; and \n(v)  strengthened  environment  and  natural  resource  management  with  enhanced \nwater and marine resource management and reduced pollution as indicators. \n \n35.  Areas (i) and (ii) are expected to help leverage much greater private sector participation. \nEngagement will be selective, and reflect the priorities of ADB\u2019s recently approved long-term \nstrategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020)7 as well as those of the Government. \n \n36.  To support the Government\u2019s goal and drawing on lessons, ADB intends to focus on  \n(i) development of infrastructure, (ii) promotion of decentralization, (iii) reduction of regional \ndisparities, (iv) enhancement of natural resource management, and (v) reform of the finance \nsector.8 Given the core objectives to develop infrastructure, promote decentralization, and \nreform the finance sector, the proposed investment in Mandiri is directly in line with ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for Indonesia and Strategy 2020.  \n \n37.  The proposal supports the Capital Market Development Program Cluster9 aimed at \nincreasing the contribution of the finance sector to economic growth and development. It also \nsupplements  the  loans  and  grants  under  the  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development \nProgram10 to help improve Indonesia\u2019s investment climate and tap the power of the private \nsector in meeting the country\u2019s huge infrastructure needs. \n \n4.  SOE Lending under the Innovation and Efficiency Initiative   \n38.  As outlined in ADB\u2019s Innovation and Efficiency Initiative: Pilot Financing Instruments and \nModalities,11 many SOEs are creditworthy and have the long-term financial viability to borrow \nwithout government guarantees. They constitute a third generation12 of potential borrowers, and \nare increasingly important as they operate rather independently from the sovereign. These \nentities play an important role in creating employment, and providing infrastructure and basic \nservices. Giving them access to affordable long-term credit is critical to promoting economic \ngrowth. In addition to providing Mandiri with a much-needed source of long-term funding, ADB\u2019s \nobjective  in  this  transaction  is  to  lend  and  facilitate  cofinancing,  in  each  case  without \ngovernment guarantee, to ensure that Mandiri\u2019s asset\u2013liability gap and corresponding liquidity \nrisk can be reduced, while enabling longer-tenor financing to be available to borrowers in the \nIndonesian market. \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2008.

The Innovation and Efficiency Initiative provides that ADB lending to an SOE should be \naccompanied by corporate and/or sector reforms. Examples of such reforms are the creation of \na sound financial base and specific undertakings for financial management, environmental and \nsocial  safeguards,  matters  regarding  operations,  and  ownership.  Mandiri  has  already \nimplemented various financial reform measures to strengthen its financial position, including \nresolving NPLs, reducing operating costs, and improving its business strategy. As part of this \nreform process, it is seeking to strengthen its balance sheet, thereby improving its financial risk \nprofile. The ADB assistance would assist in addressing Mandiri\u2019s current maturity mismatch, \nand consequently strengthen its financial base. This will greatly contribute to Mandiri\u2019s financial \nreform. \n \n40.  Mandiri  has  undertaken  numerous  corporate  governance  reforms  to  improve \nperformance, transparency, and efficiency. These reforms are in line with Government efforts to \nimprove the management and operations of SOEs, which have been supported by ADB.13 Its \nwork in this area has been publicly noted, and in light of the numerous governance awards won \nin recent years, is currently seen as a governance model for other financial institutions and \nSOEs in Indonesia. Mandiri has made clear progress in the area of operations reform, and on \nthe basis of its financial standing and the nature and depth of specific undertakings, merits \naccess to financing in accordance with the Innovation and Efficiency Initiative. \n \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n41.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nIndonesian Government will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nfinancial  assistance  to  Mandiri.  No  funding  will  be  disbursed  until  ADB  receives  such \nconfirmation. \n \n42.  ADB will enter into suitable loan documentation and other required legal documents, \nfollowing approval of the proposed financing by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors.  \n \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATIONS \n43.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove: \n \n(i)  the loan of up to $75,000,000 to Bank Mandiri (Persero) from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with procedures \napplicable to ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations and as approved by ADB\u2019s Pricing \nand Credit Enhancement Committee, a term of up to 7 years, and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthis report, and as may be reported to the Board; and \n \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2001.
