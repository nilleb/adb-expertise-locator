INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Azerbaijan (the Government) has requested technical assistance \n(TA)  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  preparing  the  Southern  Road  Corridor \nImprovement Project (Alyat\u2013Astara Road) (the Project). The TA1 was not included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy and program update 2005\u20132006 for Azerbaijan,2 as it was only identified during \nthe country programming mission in April 2005. It is now part of the revised 2005 loan and TA \nprogram, and Management has approved the concept paper for the TA. A fact-finding mission \nwas undertaken during 13\u201316 June 2005 to formulate the TA. The fact-finding mission reached \nagreement  with  the  Government  on  the  objectives,  scope,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan, \nimplementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA consultants. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Transport sector plays an important role in Azerbaijan\u2019s rapidly expanding economy. \nOver the last five years, the gross domestic product (GDP) has been growing at a rate of over \n10% per year, and that is projected to increase to 22% by 2007. The transport sector accounts \nfor 7% of Azerbaijan\u2019s GDP.3 Road transport is the preferred mode, as it carries 78% of the \npassenger and 28% of the goods traffic. It is critical for the domestic economy, because it links \nthe  local  population  with  urban  and  international  markets.  The  improvement  of  road \ninfrastructure is part of the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy, as articulated in the State \nProgram on Poverty Reduction and Economic Development that was initiated in 2001. Improved \nroads will help to reduce poverty by providing the rural poor better access to markets and social \nservices  while  ensuring  more  balanced  development.  An  improved  road  network  will  also \nenhance regional cooperation and facilitate international and transit trade.   \n \n3.  Inherited  from  the  former  Soviet  Union,  the  18,800  kilometer  (km)  road  network  of \nAzerbaijan (excluding Nakhchivan) was developed for traffic volumes and patterns significantly \ndifferent from those emerging since independence in the early 1990s. Approximately 52% of the \nroads are paved, 47% are gravel, and the remaining are earth tracks. There are two primary \nroad transport corridors. The east\u2013west (EW) highway connects the capital city of Baku with the \nGeorgian border and passes through the country\u2019s main population centers. It is part of the \nfamed \u201cSilk Route\u201d linking Central Asia and China with Europe. The north\u2013south (NS) highway \nruns parallel to the Caspian Sea and connects Baku with the Middle East and South Asia to the \nsouth and with the Russian Federation and Europe to the north. Both road corridors are part of \nthe Asian Highway Network.4 Conflict during the early years of independence and lack of \nresources have prevented regular maintenance. As a result, about 75% of the network is in poor \ncondition. Based on the road condition data available, 61% of the EW and NS highways, 76% of \nother republic roads, 66% of secondary roads, and 76% of rural roads require rehabilitation. In \naddition, projections of increased traffic indicate that the current capacity of the NS highway will \nbe insufficient and that widening and upgrading is needed.  \n \n4.  The road sector is regulated by a presidential decree5 that defines the general basis for \ndesign,  construction,  operations,  maintenance,  and  development  of  roads  and  associated \nstructures, as well as the legal, technical, economic, and institutional principles for road sector \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 19 July 2005. \n2  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132006): Azerbaijan. Manila. \n3  Based on 2004 figures in the Azerbaijan Monthly Statistical Review 2005. \n4  Sponsored by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific, the 140,000 km Asian Highway \nNetwork was adopted by an intergovernmental agreement in November 2003.    \n5  Presidential Decree No. 299 issued in March 2000 on the application of the Law of Roads of December 1999. \n ", "2 \nmanagement.  Until  2003,  the  road  sector  was  managed  by  Azeravtoyol,  a  state-owned \njoint-stock company established in 1993. It was modeled on the centralized decision-making \nsystem  of  the  former  Soviet  Union.  Because  of  its  poor  performance,  and  as  part  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s initiative to restructure key agencies, the Government dissolved Azeravtoyol and \nestablished the Ministry of Transport (MOT) in April 2003 to assume overall responsibility for \npolicy,  regulations,  and  administration  of  the  transport  sector.  The  road  sector  is  the \nresponsibility  of  two  MOT  departments:  the  Road  Transport  Services  Department  (RTSD), \nwhich looks after planning, managing, and maintaining the road network infrastructure, and the \nAuto Transport Services Department, which is responsible for regulating the road transportation.  \n \n5.  The Government has embarked upon an extensive road improvement program that \nbegins with the high-priority EW and NS road corridors. The Government also plans to develop \nother priority highways, along with secondary and tertiary roads, that provide in-country links, as \nwell as access and opportunities to the large rural population.6 With assistance from multilateral \ndevelopment banks (MDBs) and other international financial institutions (IFIs), improvement of \nthe  entire  EW  corridor  is  now  fully  funded  and  fieldwork  has  begun  on  most  sections. \nNegotiations  with  MDBs  and  other  IFIs  for  improving  the  northern  section  (Baku\u2013Russian \nborder) of the NS corridor are in their final stages. For the southern section (Baku\u2013Iranian \nborder)7, the Government is seeking assistance from MDBs and other IFIs, including ADB. \nUnder  a  bilateral  agreement,  the  Government  of  Iran  is  providing  grant  assistance  for  a \nfeasibility study and detailed design of the 243 km Alyat\u2013Astara road. An Iranian consulting firm \nbegan work in January 2005. The draft feasibility report is being prepared and the consultants \nare scheduled to complete their work by mid-2006.  \n \n6.  The proposed Project will construct a part of the road from Alyat to Astara, develop the \ncross-border facility at Astara, improve local roads to provide accessibility to poor areas in the \nSouth, and enhance the road network\u2019s sustainability by supporting policy and institutional \nreforms in the RTSD. In view of the projected high traffic volumes on the NS corridor, the RTSD \nintends to upgrade this road to category I with dual carriageway and four lanes. Based on the \ninitial feasibility work, the proposed road will be constructed on over 80% new and improved \nalignment in order to avoid major resettlement along the original corridor and to reduce the \nlength (to about 200 km). The terrain is predominantly flat, although in the southern portion the \nroad is bordered on one side by the Caspian Sea and on the other side by a mountain range. \nThe road passes through six districts, and the current estimated traffic level is about 5,000 \nvehicles per day. The institutional and policy aspects addressed under the Project include (i) \ngenerating  adequate  revenues  for  maintenance  through,  among  other  sources,  road  user \ncharges; (ii) establishing mechanisms to manage these resources are used exclusively for road \nmaintenance; (iii) institutional improvements to ensure effective maintenance operations; (iv) \ncontrolling vehicle overloading; (v) minimizing environmental and social impacts; (vi) enhancing \nroad safety; and (vii) facilitating cross-border traffic. These are discussed in more detail in the \nfollowing paragraphs. \n \n7.  The RTSD has received technical assistance8 for institutional strengthening and capacity \nbuilding. The recently completed technical assistance specifically included (i) development of a \ncorporate plan for the RTSD, (ii) road inventory and functional classification of the network, (iii) \nreview of road user charges, (iv) a pavement management system, (v) review of technical \n                                                 \n6  A presidential decree for improvement of the regional/secondary roads is expected soon. \n7  The Baku-Alyat road section has already been improved by the Government. The remaining section is the 243 km \nAlyat-Astara road. \n8  Under the ongoing World Bank-financed Highway Rehabilitation Project (approved in 2001). \n ", "    3 \nstandards and/or specifications, (vi) establishment of a financial management system, (vii) a \nquality assurance system, (viii) development of a rolling multiyear road management program, \n(ix) traffic safety, and (x) performance assessment. The technical assistance was implemented \nwith varying degrees of success for each of the activities, and significant work remains to be \ndone, particularly with regard to obtaining the Government\u2019s acceptance of the reforms and their \nimplementation.9  The  proposed  Project  will  focus  on  implementation  of  the  reforms  in \ncoordination with other ongoing and planned projects by ADB and other MDBs and IFIs. The \nproposed Project will also benefit from the ADB-financed technical assistance for transport \nsector development strategy10 that is scheduled to begin in October 2005.   \n \n8.  Road maintenance lacks adequate resources, planning that is based on road conditions, \nand timely implementation. The allocations for road maintenance increased significantly from \n$6.7 million in 2001 to $14.4 million in 2004. They are expected to increase further to $23 million \nin 2005, although this remains far below the present needs. It is estimated that $260 million \nwould be required if the entire 18,800 km network were to be properly maintained. A 10-year \nprogram  (2006\u20132015)  is  under  discussion  with  the  Government  to  gradually  increase \nmaintenance funding to the desired level. Road maintenance is currently undertaken by the \nRTSD\u2019s  61  rayon-based  road  maintenance  units  on  a  force  account  basis.  Each  road \nmaintenance unit is responsible for the main and secondary roads in its individual rayon and \nuses  its  own  labor  force  and  construction  plants.  Based  on  findings  from  the  technical \nassistance cited in paragraph 7, the RTSD is considering the establishment of 4\u20135 regional road \nmaintenance units that will be responsible for managing periodic maintenance using the newly \nintroduced pavement management system, which provides the necessary steps of the planning \ncycle and relies on the HDM-4 model11 for prioritizing the network. Periodic maintenance will be \nundertaken  by  private  sector  contractors  using  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Routine \nmaintenance will be initially undertaken by the rayon-based road maintenance units using force \naccount procedures. These units will gradually be encouraged to bid for these works, which will \nalso be open to private sector contractors.   \n \n9.  Road safety needs to be improved in Azerbaijan, as the number of road accidents has \nincreased significantly since 2001. In 2002, there were over 2,200 road accidents recorded that \nresulted in 570 fatalities and about 2,500 injuries. The fatality rate was about 17 persons per \n10,000 vehicles, which is much higher than in western European countries. The economic loss \nfrom road accidents in 2002 was over $110 million, which accounted for 1.7% of annual GDP. \nThe major causes of road accidents are poor road conditions, lack of safety features and \nfacilities, weak road safety enforcement, intoxicated driving, and inadequate driver education. \nThe National Road Safety Commission is unable to coordinate, as it does not have executive or \noperational powers. The Government is reviewing a five-year road traffic safety plan,12 which \nincludes an action plan to improve road safety as well as a national policy and targets for road \naccident reduction. However, formal adoption and implementation of these recommendations is \npending. \n                                                 \n9  A  part  of  the  follow-up  work  has  been  included  under  the  proposed  ADB-financed  East\u2013West  Highway \nImprovement Project which is due for Board consideration this year. The proposed EBRD project for improvement \nof the North-West corridor also supports implementation of the reforms.  \n10 ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Azerbaijan for Transport Sector Development Strategy. \nManila.  The  strategy  will  cover  all  modes  of  transport  and  includes  (i)  a  sector  update,  (ii)  government \ndevelopment plans, (iii) long-term development needs, policy reforms and regulatory requirements in line with \nGovernment goals, (iv) stakeholder consultations, (v) MOT capacity building, and (vi) roles of the Government, \nprivate sector and regulatory bodies. \n11  High Design and Maintenance software (version 4) \n12 Draft Five-Year Road Traffic Safety Program, December 2004, prepared under the World Bank-financed Highway \nRehabilitation Project. \n ", "4 \n \n10.  Vehicle overloading is one of the major causes of premature and excessive pavement \ndeterioration. Axle load surveys conducted during 1998\u22121999 on the EW highway showed that \n20% of four-axle trucks, 16% of five-axle trucks and 13% of buses exceeded the axle load limit. \nThe  recently  reconstructed  Alyat\u2013Haciqabul  section  of  the  EW  highway  shows  serious \npavement  damage  at  a  number  of  locations  due  to  overloading.  Although  Azerbaijan  has \ndeveloped regulations that limit vehicle axle loads to 13 tons, there is an urgent need to \nstrengthen enforcement of axle load control for sustainability of the road network. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impacts of the Project will include (i) reduced transport costs on the NS corridor, (ii) \nenhanced regional cooperation and trade due to improved access to the Middle Eastern and \nSouth Asian markets to the south and to the Russian Federation and Europe to the north, and \n(iii) economic development of  Azerbaijan\u2019s southern region due to  increased mobility. The \nProject belongs to one of the four strategically selected areas for ADB assistance in Azerbaijan. \nIt is consistent with the poverty reduction strategy outlined in the State Program on Poverty \nReduction and Economic Development, which includes, among other priorities, improvement of \nroad infrastructure. The outcome of the Project is improved connectivity to southern Azerbaijan \nwith better access to the population centers. The proposed Project will construct a part of  the \n243 km road from Alyat (south of Baku City) to Astara (on the border with Iran), develop the \ncross-border  facility  at  Astara,  enhance  sustainability  by  supporting  policy  and  institutional \nreforms, and improve local roads to provide accessibility to poor areas in the South.    \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  International consultants, supported by domestic consultants, will be engaged to help the \nGovernment prepare the Project. The consultants will work closely with RTSD staff and provide \non-the-job training in order to develop necessary skills for project preparation. The TA will \ninvolve fieldwork and stakeholder consultations with the Government, local authorities, civil \nsociety, the private sector, user groups, and international development partners. The TA will \ninclude a stakeholder consultation workshop. The initial poverty and social analysis (Appendix \n2) for the Project was undertaken during the fact-finding.    \n \n13.  Key TA activities include (i) reviewing and finalizing the detailed engineering design of \nthe Alyat\u2013Astara road being undertaken by the Iranian consultants;13 (ii) economic, poverty, \nsocial, resettlement, and environmental analysis of the proposed Project; (iii) preparing the \nrequired resettlement plan, as well as initial environmental examination and environmental \nimpact assessment; (iv) preparing a proposal for improving local roads to less developed areas \nin southern Azerbaijan; (v) designing a cross-border facility at Astara; (vi) identifying institutional \nstrengthening needs of the RTSD and recommending measures for capacity development; and \n(vii) addressing the road sector policy issues that involve rationalizing road user charges for \nmaintenance  funding,  managing  maintenance  resources,  ensuring  effective  maintenance, \ncontrolling vehicle overloading, minimizing environmental and social impacts, and enhancing \nroad safety. \n \n14.  The TA will result in a project suitable for ADB financing. The deliverables include (i) a \nfeasibility study of the Alyat\u2013Astara road, (ii) finalized detailed design of the road section to be \n                                                 \n13  This will involve review of the design standards, methodology and technical specifications, and it will be supported \nby spot field surveys and selected material testing.  \n ", "    5 \nfinanced under the Project, (iii) design of a cross-border facility at Astara, (iv) meeting safeguard \ncompliance  requirements,  (v)  feasibility  of  proposed  local  roads  in  the  project  area,  (vi) \nproposals for institutional strengthening of road agency and policy reforms, and (vii) a project \nframework that includes monitoring indicators for development impacts and baseline data. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The estimated cost of the TA is $875,000 equivalent, including a foreign exchange cost \nof $483,500 and a local currency cost of $391,500. The detailed cost estimate is in Appendix 3. \nADB will finance $700,000 equivalent, including the foreign exchange cost of $483,500 and \nlocal currency cost of $216,500 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the \nJapan Special Fund, financed by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the \nremaining local currency cost of $175,000 by providing office space, counterpart staff, and \nadministrative support. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The RTSD will be the Executing Agency and will appoint a project director to manage \nthe TA, oversee day-to-day functions, and coordinate with other Government agencies and \nother stakeholders. A steering committee, chaired by the deputy minister of the MOT, will be \nestablished to provide guidance and directions, particularly on policy and institutional aspects \nand  to  approve  the  proposal  for  local/secondary  roads.  The  committee  will  include \nrepresentatives from the MOT, RTSD, ministries of finance and of economic development, State \nCustoms Committee, traffic police, and other relevant agencies.  \n \n17.  The TA will be undertaken over a period of 5 months, starting in February 2006. It will be \ncarried out by an international consulting firm in association with domestic consultants. The TA \nwill  require  74  person-months  of  consultants\u2019  input,  comprising  21  person-months  of \ninternational  consultants  and  53  person-months  of  domestic  consultants.  Outline  terms  of \nreference  and  reporting  requirements  for  the  consulting  services  are  in  Appendix  4.  The \nconsultants will be engaged using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection procedures, and \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for selecting and engaging the domestic consultants. The international staff will include \n(i) a transport economist/team leader, (ii) a highway engineer, (iii) a pavement specialist, (iv) \ncontracts  specialist,  (v)  an  institutional/financial  management  specialist,  (vi)  a  road \nmaintenance/road safety specialist, (vii) a bridge engineer, (viii) a poverty/social development \nspecialist, (ix) a resettlement specialist, and (x) an environmental specialist. These will be \nsupported by domestic staff. The consultants will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement in \nprocuring equipment, supplies, and materials. The equipment will be turned over to the RTSD \nafter TA completion. \n \n18.  A workshop involving all stakeholders\u2014the Government, local authorities, community \nrepresentatives, user groups, private sector, civil society, nongovernment organizations, and \nother development partners\u2014will be conducted on the proposed Project, and the findings will be \nincorporated into the project design.  \n \nIV.

Not applicable.    No \n       \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Azerbaijan: \nThe road sector is one of the important transport modes in Azerbaijan, carrying 78% of passengers and over 28% of \nfreight annually. However, many roads are in poor condition, thus inhibiting economic growth and regional trade. The \nState Program on Poverty Reduction and Economic Development (2003\u22122005), developed with Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  assistance,  and  the  State  Program  for  Socioeconomic  Development  of  the  Regions  (2004\u22122008)  identify \nrehabilitation of major road infrastructure as a precondition for regional economic growth and poverty reduction. The \nSouthern Road Corridor Improvement Project (the Project) will include construction of about 200 km of four-lane divided \nhighway from Alyat to Astara at the border with Iran. This will promote economic growth and poverty reduction in \nAzerbaijan while fostering its cooperation with other countries in the region. The major poverty reduction impact of the \nProject will be due to (i) jobs and income created for the poor living along the road related to construction and \nmaintenance, (ii) improved access of the poor to markets and social services, and (iii) reduced prices for food and other \ndaily necessities in local markets because of lower transport costs. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                               Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nThe project area consists of six rayons (districts): Astara, Bilasuvar, Calilabad, Lankeran, Masalli, and Salyan. These \nhave a total population of 850,000, according to 2004 population estimates. Urban residents account for about 72% of the \ntotal population in the project area. About half of the total population was living in poverty as of 2003, based on the \ninternational income standard of $1 per day. The national average salary was only AZM383,058 ($78.0) in 2003. There \nare few if any internally displaced people in the project area. However, the Talysh, who constitute the main indigenous \ngroup in this region, inhabit the southern half of the project area. Before 1989, the Talysh were not distinguished in the \ncensus. Government statistics from 2004, however, indicate that the Talysh number 80,000, of which 68,000 reside in the \nproject area. Unofficially, many more people are of Talysh origin and still speak the Talysh language in addition to Azeri.  \n \nThe main cause of poverty is unemployment from the closing down of industries that operated in Soviet times. Much of \nthe economic development in the project area is based on agriculture, tourism and trade. However, poor road conditions \nlimit the potential for economic development. The cost of reaching markets outside of the project area is high, due to poor \nroad conditions and expensive transport services with low quality. Improving infrastructure, including roads, is one of the \nkey strategic priorities in the State Program for Poverty Reduction and Economic Development for 2003\u22122005. The \nProject will contribute to poverty reduction in the area by improving the southern road corridor and local roads and \nproviding conditions for increased roadside commercial activities, thereby increasing local communities\u2019 access to \nmarkets, job opportunities, and basic social services. The Project is expected to create many temporary employment \nopportunities for local people during construction.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes   No  \nConsultations began during the feasibility study and further consultation will be conducted as part of the project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA). Key stakeholders include central government agencies, local authorities, civil \nsociety, local communities, the private sector, and external aid agencies (particularly the World Bank, which may provide \nco-financing). Consultation will focus on major project issues, such as alignment alternatives, selection of local roads, \npotential benefits, and social and environmental impacts. Special attention is being given to the needs and constraints \nfaced by the poor, women, ethnic minorities, and other vulnerable groups.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?   Yes                 No \nDuring the PPTA, an outline of the target groups and participation objectives will be developed for the preparation, \nconstruction and operations phases of the Project. This strategy will take into account the need for ensuring local \nawareness of project plans and activities, from detailed design through implementation. It will use multiple methods, such \nas public meetings, newspaper advertising, and local public announcements. The strategy will also include a consultative \nphase during PPTA wherein a consultant provided by the Project can cooperate with local stakeholders to develop \nappropriate locations and designs for pedestrian and livestock crossing points, lighting, speed control, roadside market \n ", "  Appendix 2  9\nareas, etc. This strategy will be reviewed with representatives of the identified target groups, and the strategy will be \nmodified according to relevant inputs. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nAlthough Azerbaijan\u2019s Constitution guarantees equality of rights between men and women, women\u2019s socioeconomic \nstatus has been declining since the breakup of the former Soviet Union, and especially in rural areas. The vulnerable \nwomen in the project area comprise widows, female heads of households, and orphans. The PPTA will assess the project \nimpacts on women (including the potential risks of HIV/AIDS/STIa and of human trafficking) and identify opportunities and \nactions to enhance project benefits for women. These could include job opportunities during the implementation (e.g., in \nconstruction, catering, cleaning, food services, and office work) and in such roadside businesses as cafes and shops. \nSpecial consideration will be given to Talysh women. \n \nHas an output been prepared?   Yes   No \n \nE.
