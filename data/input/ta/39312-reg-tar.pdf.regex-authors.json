On 1 September 2005, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)+31 Asian \nBond  Markets  Initiative  (ABMI)  Working  Group  on  Foreign  Exchange  Transactions  and \nSettlement Issues (FXSI) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to study risk reduction \nin clearing and settlement, particularly regarding foreign exchange (FX) settlement risk2 for \ncross-border bond transactions. ABMI is a regional initiative established under the ASEAN+3 \nFinance  Ministers\u2019  Meeting.  The  President,  under  ADB\u2019s  3-year  Knowledge  Products  and \nService Workplan 2006\u20132008, 3 approved the technical assistance (TA) concept clearance on \n3 October 2005.4 The TA design was discussed and subsequently endorsed by ASEAN+3 on \n17  March  2006  at  the  ABMI  Focal  Group  meeting  held  at  ADB,  Headquarters  in  Manila, \nPhilippines. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The lack of well-developed local currency bond markets, which resulted in maturity and \ncurrency mismatches for borrowers in the region, was one of the causes of the 1997 Asian \nfinancial crisis. At the time, overdependence on bank financing forced borrowers to take on \nexcessive short-term foreign exchange exposure to finance long-term projects that could only \ngenerate local currency revenue. This created two \u201cmismatch\u201d problems: (i) loan maturities \nbecame  too  divergent  to  the  detriment  of  both  local  creditors  and  borrowers;  and  (ii)  the \ncurrencies in which the loans were made became vulnerable to exchange rate volatility, or \nworse, local currency exchange rate depreciation. When international confidence in one local \ncurrency  caused  a  rapid  depreciation  against  the  US  dollar,  a  payments  crisis  ensued, \nexacerbating the loss in confidence across the region (the \u201ccontagion\u201d effect). This led to \nbanking  and  currency  crises  in  several  countries.  With  improved  global  macroeconomic \nconditions in recent years and the structural reforms implemented throughout the region, most \ncrisis-affected economies recovered and have returned to robust growth. However, the lack of \nefficient bond markets in the region remains, so the absence of alternative sources of long-term \nlocal currency finance continues to be a source of potential financial vulnerability. \n \n3.  With this in mind, ASEAN+3 finance ministers established the ABMI in August 2003 to \nboost development of local currency bond markets. Currently, the ABMI Focal Group5 and four \nworking groups focus on (i) expanding the pool of issuers on local currency bond markets, and \n(ii) developing a regulatory environment that promotes good governance and is thus attractive to \ndomestic  and  regional  bond  market  participants.  The  working  groups  offer  policy \nrecommendations to ASEAN+3 finance ministers, who decide on the next steps for bond market \ndevelopment within the region. ADB has supported ABMI since its inception, particularly through \n                                                 \n1  ASEAN+3  includes  the  10  members  of  ASEAN  (Brunei  Darussalam,  Cambodia,  Indonesia,  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam), Japan, People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, and Republic of Korea. \n2  FX settlement risk refers to risk exposure to payments arising during bond settlements in cross-border transactions. \n3  ADB. 2005. Three-year ADB-wide KPS Work Plan 2006\u20132008. Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 18 January 2006.  \n5  There were initially six working groups (WGs): (WG1) New Securitized Debt Instruments (chaired by Thailand) \n(WG2) Regional Credit Guarantee and Investment Mechanism (the People\u2019s Republic of China [PRC] and the \nRepublic of Korea); (WG3) Foreign Exchange Transaction and Settlement Issues (Malaysia); (WG4) Issuance of \nbonds denominated in local currencies by multilateral development banks, foreign government agencies (PRC); \n(WG5) Rating Systems and Dissemination of Information (Japan and Singapore); and (WG6) TA Coordination \n(Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines). The working groups were reorganized in 2005: WG4 achieved its objectives \nand was dissolved, while WG5 became WG4 and was renamed Working Group on Rating Systems. WG6 was \nmoved directly under the Ad-Hoc Support Team to the newly created Focal Group, an apex body that oversees \noverall ABMI progress. \n ", "2   \nthe provision of TA.6 The ABMI also complements work done by other regional forums on bond \nmarket development, including the Executives\u2019 Meeting of the East Asia-Pacific Central Banks \n(EMEAP) and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).7 \n \n4.  In  line  with  a  recommendation  included  in  ADB\u2019s  report  on  ASEAN+3  Regional \nSettlement Linkages8, WG3 (footnote 5) requested ADB to further analyze ways to minimize FX \nsettlement risk for cross-border bond transactions.9 The report cited FX settlement risk as one \nmajor  detriment  to  increasing  cross-border  bond  settlement.10 In  cross-border  transactions, \ndifferent time zones mean different operational hours for national payment systems, leaving \ntrading  parties  faced  with  potential  FX  losses  (Herstatt  risks).11 Thus, true  delivery  versus \npayment (DVP) rarely occurs. The development of a well-functioning FX settlement system\u2014\nwhere transactions are timely, definitive, and cost-efficient\u2014can help minimize this risk and \ncontribute to a more efficient bond market. As FX transaction volume rises within the region,12 \nminimizing FX settlement risk can also bring about greater financial stability. To some extent, \nthese issues were examined in the EMEAP and Bank for International Settlements (BIS) studies, \nbut without focus on issues pertinent to bond market development in ASEAN+3.13 \n \n5.  There  are  currently  several  means  for  cross-border  bond  settlement:  (i)  global \ncustodians, (ii) local agents (financial institutions in the local market), (iii) direct access, (iv) \ninternational  central  securities  depositories  (ICSDs),  and  (v)  linkages  of  central  securities \ndepositories  (CSDs)  in  the  region.  However,  because  of  the  current  low  volume  of  Asian \ncurrency-denominated bond market transactions (as well as limitations on currency convertibility, \nlegal  uncertainties,  and  over-regulation  in  some  countries),  most  clearing  and  settlement \nproviders  offer  very  limited  Asian  coverage  and  services.  Settlement  of  Asian  currency-\n                                                 \n6  ADB currently provides (or has provided) TAs for the following ABMI initiatives: ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance \nfor ASEAN+3 Regional Guarantee Mechanism. Manila. (TA 6127-REG, for $800,000, approved on 27 October); \nADB.  2003.  Technical  Assistance  for  ASEAN+3  Regional  Settlement  Linkage.  Manila.  (TA  6161\u2013REG,  for \n$300,000, approved on 19 December); ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for ASEAN+3 Regional Multicurrency \nBonds.  Manila.  (TA  6244-REG,  for  $400,000,  approved  on  3  June);  and  Japan  Fund  for  Information  and \nCommunications Technology 9040: the AsianBondsOnline website (http://asianbondsonline.adb.org) and the Asian \nBond Monitor.  \n7  EMEAP initiatives include enhancing the demand side for bond market development through Asian Bond Funds 1 \nand 2. APEC initiatives included the Initiative on Development of Securitization and Credit Guarantee, and \nHarmonization of Bond Market Rules and Regulations. \n8   ADB. 2005. Bond Market Settlement and Emerging Linkages in Selected ASEAN+3 Countries. Manila (June). \n9  In 1997, ADB conducted the \u201cTechnical Study on Strengthening Clearing and Settlement Systems for Bonds\u201d \n(ADB. 1996. Technical Assistance for New Initiatives on Infrastructure Financing and Regional Capital Market \nDevelopment. Manila [TA 5708-REG, approved on 11 November 1996]). The study concluded that there was no \nneed for a regional settlement system as existing global clearing institutions would suffice. However, as the study \nfocused on clearing for Dragon bonds and dollar-denominated bonds issued in Asia, a second study (TA 6161\u2013\nREG [footnote 6]) was carried out, this time focusing on how regional settlement systems can enhance local \ncurrency bond market transactions in ASEAN+3. The study included an assessment of whether a regional linkage \nbetween settlement systems is viable. Although there was no consensus regarding the need to create a regional \nlinkage, the study put forth four recommendations: (i) enhancing transparency, (ii) complying with international \nstandards, (iii) boosting regional cooperation, and (iv) reducing risk. The study was completed in June 2005. \n10 Other risks include legal risk, operational risk, and credit risk.  \n11 Herstatt risk is the risk that one party to a FX transaction takes when it pays the currency it sold, but does not \nsimultaneously receive the currency it bought.  \n12 Bank  for  International  Settlements  (BIS).  2004.  Triennial  Survey  of  Central  Banks,  Foreign  Exchange  and \nDerivatives Market. Switzerland. The survey noted that average global FX daily turnover surged 57% from 2001 to \n2004, with Asia accounting for about 19% of the increase. \n13 EMEAP. 2001. Foreign Exchange Settlement Risk in East Asia Pacific Region. The report does not discuss \nparticipants other than commercial banks. In addition, there are no publicly available studies on development of \nbankruptcy laws that form the basis for PVP. The BIS Study on Reducing Foreign Exchange Settlement Risk \ncovered only FX markets in Group of 10 industrialized (or commonly known as G10) countries. \n ", "  3\ndenominated bonds remains exposed to Herstatt risk as most ICSDs, such as Euroclear and \nClearstream, operate from different time zones than Asian markets. This can lead to other risks, \nsuch as available liquidity, which could contribute to instability in the region\u2019s financial market.14 \nTo further eliminate FX settlement risk, participation to the Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) \nBank15 is also important. However, there are currently only four Asian currencies (Hong Kong \ndollar, Japanese yen, Korean won, and Singapore dollar) eligible for CLS Bank settlement. CLS \nBank has indicated informally that it wants to increase trading volume for the existing 15 \ncurrencies it covers rather than increasing the number of eligible currencies. For non-CLS Asian \ncurrencies, FX transactions may see widening spreads as a result of FX settlement risk, and the \nincreased costs associated with settlement through a correspondent bank, i.e., third party bank \n(a  CLS  settlement  member).  There  is  also  a  higher  risk  incurred  when  using  settlement \nprocedures that do not comply with international standards. Given this, real-time settlement of \nCLS noneligible Asian currency-denominated bonds is not possible. \n \n6.  Preliminary work done with WG3 (footnote 5) suggests several options to mitigate the \nFX settlement risk. First, the region could continue to rely on existing local agents, global \ncustodians, or ICSDs. However, there is concern that this approach will limit settlement to the \nfew firms currently providing such services. This concentration could indeed add further risk. \nEarlier studies have shown that global financial market efficiency coincides with a huge potential \nrisk with a system concentrated in few operators.16 Moreover, as long as the volume of cross-\nborder trade of Asian currency-denominated bonds is insignificant and regulatory impediments \nremain, these operators are unlikely to extend their coverage in Asia. Thus, heavy reliance on \nexisting operators will continue Herstatt risk and slow bond market development within the \nregion. An alternative option is establishing a regional settlement intermediary (RSI) within Asia, \nas a \u201cthird time zone,\u201d to service Asian business hours. Besides providing DVP to settle Asian \ncurrency-denominated  bond  transactions,  the  RSI  could  provide  PVP  for  Asian  currency \nsettlement. The RSI could be linked to CLS Bank, real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems,17 \nand CSDs in each ASEAN+3 country. Aside from resolving the Herstatt risk issue, an RSI \nestablished with ASEAN+3 support could induce the region\u2019s capital markets to harmonize \nregulations better, leading to further and speedier bond market development across the region. \n \n7.  Asian bond market participants say that the private sector alone will not initiate any \nregional entities such as the RSI unless there is a reasonable profitability timetable. In addition, \nany regional settlement entity such as an RSI is often viewed as public infrastructure requiring \ngovernment  support.  The  proposed  study  would  allow  ABMI  to  jump-start  the  process  of \ncreating an RSI that would draw the private sector in as a catalytic participant in deepening \nbond market development in the region. \n                                                 \n14 Herstatt risk can lead to liquidity risk\u2014a risk that arises when counterparties must settle obligations, not on the due \ndate, but on an unspecified later date. For example, because of time zone differences, the failure of Bankhaus \nHerstatt (1974) led to its counterpart banks\u2019 exposure to German mark deliveries in the absence of suspended \nUS dollars they expected from Bankhaus Herstatt.  \n15 CLS Bank opened in 2002 to provide a multilateral currency netting mechanism to remove the loss-of-principal risk \non FX transactions by ensuring simultaneous PVP settlement and thus finality on both sides of the FX transactions. \nMore information regarding membership and eligibility criteria can be found at http://www.cls-group.com. \n16 European Central Bank. 2003. Review of the Foreign Exchange Market Structure. Germany; Cross, Sam Y. 1998. \nAll About the Foreign Exchange Market in the United States. New York: Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  \n17 RTGS is defined by BIS as a gross settlement system  whereby both fund transfers and bond settlement \ninstructions can be processed in real time. As a gross settlement system, transfers are settled individually, i.e., \nwithout netting debits against credits. As a real-time settlement system, it effects final settlement continuously \nrather than periodically at prespecified times. Moreover, it is based on the real-time transfer of central bank funds. \nAn RTGS system can thus be characterised as a funds transfer system that is able to provide continuous intraday \nfinality for individual transfers. \n ", "4   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA aims to reduce regional financial vulnerabilities by offering ways to minimize \nclearing and settlement risk and thus encourage greater Asian currency-denominated cross-\nborder bond transactions. The outcome is to increase the volume of cross-border bond issuance, \nincrease trade transactions, and thus bolster the attractiveness of investing in local currency \nAsian  bond  markets.  The  TA  will  contribute  to  providing  efficient,  timely,  and  reliable \ninfrastructure  for  these  markets.  It  will  assist  government  officials  by  offering  policy \nrecommendations that remove impediments in clearing and settlement bond transactions, which \nwill encourage local currency bond market development. The TA complements ADB\u2019s Office of \nRegional Economic Integration (OREI) drive to (i) promote regional economic policy dialogue by \ncontributing active support to ABMI, and (ii) conduct research in the area of regional cooperation \nand integration. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  A  key  factor  to  the  study\u2019s  success  will  be  the  feasibility  of  the  resultant \nrecommendations, driven to a large extent by the views and other inputs of market participants. \nADB, together with the TA consultants, will consult with the private sector through organized \nmeetings  and/or  conferences  in  addition  to  augmenting  existing  dialogue  with  all  other \nstakeholders. The TA design will be relatively flexible to accommodate views from both the \nprivate sector and government officials. ADB, together with TA consultants, will meet regularly \nwith  WG3  members  to  discuss  and  consult  with  them  on  the  TA  design  and  to  develop \nappropriate policy recommendations. The scope of the TA, with preliminary agreement with \nWG3 members, includes the following five components (paras 10\u201314). \n \n10.  The study will review the nature of FX settlement risks in cross-border bond transactions. \nExisting information and data from the ASEAN+3 Regional Settlement Linkage report (footnote \n8) and the BIS and EMEAP reports (footnote 13) will be used as supporting information for \nbuilding an assessment of the extent of FX settlement risk in each ASEAN+3 market. FX risk \nmitigation practices and FX transaction and settlement volumes between ASEAN+3 currencies \nwill also be examined. \n \n11.  The study will (i) review available options in existing markets for settlement (including the \nrole of CLS Bank); and (ii) assess each option\u2019s potential effects, both positive and negative, in \nreducing FX settlement risk arising from bond trades. The impact on bond market development \nwill also be studied. The analysis will include an assessment of the applicability and viability of \neach option for each ASEAN+3 country. Using gap analysis, the study will describe current \ntechnical, regulatory, and market challenges, among others, that face ASEAN+3 countries. \n  \n12.  The study will explore the establishment of an RSI by examining several issues: (i) a \ndetailed cost-benefit analysis, (ii) definition of the proposed roles and functions of an RSI, \n(iii) ownership, (iv) supervisory oversight, (v) level of participation by individual governments \nand/or ASEAN+3, (vi) linkages between RTGS systems, and (vii) specific private and public \nsector  roles  in  an  RSI.  Aside  from  its  ability  to  act  as  intermediary  for  non-CLS  eligible \ncurrencies, an RSI could also provide a platform for an efficient cash management facility \n(which many private sector participants have suggested in earlier consultations) as well as \nbecome an information source for both payment and securities settlement, or become a regional \n ", "  5\nsettlement agent for Asian multicurrency bonds, if and when they are issued. The role of the RSI \nin facilitating bond market development will also be discussed. \n \n13.  The study will develop a possible model for an RSI, identify potential impediments to its \nestablishment,  and  highlight  issues  for  further  consideration.  This  component  is  meant  to \nprovide a practical example that could be implemented in the short term upon agreement by \nrelevant parties. \n \n14.  The study will propose recommendations to WG3, and provide an appropriate roadmap \nto policymakers to remove identified impediments. It will also proffer ways to further reduce FX \nsettlement risk in the longer term.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at the equivalent of $700,000. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. \nAppendix 2 gives the details of the TA cost. Participating ASEAN+3 members have financed the \ncosts of individual WG3 activities and intend to continue to do so.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the Executing and Implementing Agency for the TA. It will be implemented \nand administered by OREI. In consultation with WG3 and especially the WG3 chair, OREI will \nsupervise the work of the TA consultants.  \n \n17.  Two international consultants (one clearing and settlement specialist and one bond \nmarket development specialist) will be hired for a total of 13 person-months. The consultants will \nhave extensive experience in bond market development and clearing and settlement systems in \nthe region. Outlined terms of reference are in Appendix 3. The consultants will be engaged by \nADB as individual consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nProcurement of equipment (computer, software, and other related items) will be in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. After completion of the TA, any procured equipment could \nbe retained by ADB for further use in other future TAs.  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 8 months and is expected to begin in August 2006, to \nbe completed by March 2007. A series of consultations with market participants will be held in \nSeptember 2006. With these inputs, as well as those from government officials, the draft interim \nreport will be submitted to WG3 in November 2006. A final presentation to WG3 is expected in \nMarch 2007. The outline of the content of the report is in Appendix 4. Upon its completion, the \nreport will be disseminated within ADB and appropriate websites,18 with external publication of \nthe report subject to approval by WG3 members. \n \nIV.
