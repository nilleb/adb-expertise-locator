INTRODUCTION \n1.  In Sri Lanka, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) is the primary \nservice provider for water supply and sanitation management services across the country, \nexcept for the wastewater management service in Colombo City, which is under the mandate of \nthe  Colombo  Municipal  Council.  NWSDB  is  presently  operating  312  water  supply  schemes \nthroughout the country.  NWSDB also operates sewerage schemes and provides about 3% of the \npopulation with a piped sewerage connection. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is one of the \nmajor  development  partners  involved  in  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector, \nproviding  eight  loans for  a  total  amount  of  about  $521  million  since  1986.1 Among them, \nNWSDB is the executing agency for seven loans, including four loans ongoing. \n \n2.  Over the past 10 years, NWSDB has made significant progress in improving access of \nurban residents to safe drinking water\u2014the pipe-borne water supply coverage serviced by the \nNWSDB has increased from 19.0% of the population in 2004 to 34.5% by the end of 2013. In the \n\u201cMahinda Chinthana Vision for the Future,\u201d the Government of Sri Lanka highly prioritized further \nimproving water supply and sanitation services, setting a target for providing access to safe \ndrinking water and improved sanitation to all citizens by the year 2020, which requires a further \nincrease in the pipe-borne water supply coverage to 60.0%.2 This will require continued capital \ninvestment throughout the planned period to fill the sector\u2019s infrastructure gaps.3 Furthermore, this \nwill require significant institutional capacity development of NWSDB to manage new challenges \nand to continue as the sector\u2019s leading agency for infrastructure development and service provision.  \n \n3.  Against  this  background,  the  government  requests  ADB  to  provide  the  capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance (TA) to help NWSDB review and rationalize its institutional setup \nand conduct the most prioritized reform and capacity development activities. The TA is included in \nthe ADB country operations business plan, 2013\u20132015 for Sri Lanka.4 An ADB fact-finding \nmission  was  conducted  1\u20135  September  2014.  This  report  is  based  on  the  understanding \nreached  with  the  government  and  NWSDB  regarding  the  TA  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  costs  and  financing  arrangements,  and  outline  terms  of \nreference for consulting services. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Established in 1975, NWSDB has developed into a large organization with more than \n10,000  employees  across  the  country.  NWSDB  has  12  regional  supporting  centers  (RSCs) \nresponsible for operating and maintaining the local system, collecting the water bill, and initiating \nnew development projects at the local level. 6 However, NWSDB remains a highly centralized \ngovernance structure under a consolidated operation and financial management system, with all \nmajor decisions made at the headquarters in Colombo. Through this centralized management \n                                                \n1  Other main contributors to water supply and sanitation are Japan International Cooperation Agency, Agence \nFran\u00e7aise De D\u00e9veloppement, and the World Bank. \n2  Government of Sri Lanka, Ministry of Financing and Planning, 2010, Mahinda Chinthana Vision for the Future, \nColombo.

Country Operations Business Plan: Sri Lanka, 2013\u20132015. Manila. \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 September 2014. \n6  The first batch of RSCs was established in 1987 to decentralize water supply activities and improve productivity \nprimarily on operation and maintenance for better customer service. \n ", "2 \nsystem, NWSDB is able to allocate sector resources for development across different geographical \nregions and has attained its water supply and sanitation achievement to date.  \n \n5.  At the same time, this structure has shortcomings. The system has made it difficult for \nNWSDB to establish a well-defined structure to measure the operational costs and efficiency \namong different schemes. It is difficult for its operational schemes to be managed as a self-\nsustained service provider like other utility companies. Many state of the art technologies for water \nsupply system management cannot be applied due to lack of financial discipline and accountability \nat the local level. NWSDB\u2019s potential to involve other stakeholders, including the private sector, in \ninfrastructure development and/or service provision is affected by the lack of a well-established \nfinancial model and cost recovery mechanism at the local or project level. \n \n6.  The overall operational efficiency of NWSDB\u2019s system is weak. In comparison with other \nwell-performing utility companies in Asia, NWSDB has employed more staff for the same number \nof consumers, yet has been suffering a much higher level of system loss. The level of nonrevenue \nwater (NRW) in Colombo is 49.0%, compared with 11.0% in Manila Water, 6.2% in Phnom \nPenh, and 4.4% in Singapore. In terms of staff employed per 1,000 connections, the Colombo \nwater supply system requires 3.9 staff members, compared with 3.3 for Phnom Penh, 2.5 for \nSingapore, and 1.4 for Manila Water. 7 \n \n7.  Under the recently approved multitranche financing facility for Greater Colombo Water \nand  Wastewater  Management  Improvement  Investment  Program,8 ADB  committed  to  help \nNWSDB improve its operational efficiency in the Greater Colombo area, with a target to reduce \nthe NRW level in Colombo from 49% to 20% by 2020. Among other tasks, ADB will help \nNWSDB  convert  RSC\u2013Western  Central  into  an  autonomous  operational  center,  which  can \noperate and maintain the expanded and upgraded water supply system for Greater Colombo on \na sustainable basis and at an efficiency level compatible with international best practice.  \n \n8.  In  line  with  reforms  initiated  under  the  investment  program,  NWSDB  needs  new \ninstitutional setup to promote financial discipline, operational efficiency, and accountability at \nselected RSCs through a more decentralized decision-making and service-provision mechanism \nto better respond to the local needs in different regions or operational schemes. Furthermore, \nNWSDB will need to mobilize resources from the private sector to supplement public investment \nin achieving the sector development goals set in the \u201cMahinda Chinthana Vision for the Future.\u201d   \n \n9.  Along with decentralization of service provision in the water supply and sanitation sector \nintroduced  under  the  investment  program,  the  country  will  need  to  gradually  develop  an \nindependent sector regulatory mechanism and capability to regulate a more diversified service \nprovision system.  \n \n10.  As the sector\u2019s leading agency, NWSDB has the mandate and responsibility to identify \nwater supply and sanitation projects, prepare prefeasibility and feasibility studies for them, create \ndesigns, produce final drawings, and carry out processing and project implementation for public- \nfunded projects. Considering the massive investment required in the sector, NWSDB needs to \nfurther strengthen its project preparation and implementation capacity. In particular, NWSDB \nneeds to establish a new division to manage the environmental and social safeguards aspects \nduring development project preparation and implementation. Furthermore, NWSDB needs to \n                                                \n7  Good Practices in Urban Water Management ADB 2012.  \n8  ADB. 2012.

THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA impact will be improved operational efficiency and accountability of NWSDB. \nThe  TA  outcome  will  be  improved  institutional  and  technical  capacity  of  NWSDB.  A  new \nRegulatory Division, an Environment and Social Division, and an NRW Management Division \nwill be established and in operation. The Planning and Design Division will be enhanced using \nupdated design manuals and management tools. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will help NWSDB review its institutional structure and propose a more efficient \nand accountable set-up. The TA will recruit an international water utility management expert to \nreview the NWSDB\u2019s institutional structure and set-up. Since NWSDB has developed rapidly \nfrom a small size to a relatively large organization, it needs an efficient institutional structure to \nenable it to meet its business needs.  \n \n13.  The TA will promote NWSDB\u2019s institutional development through decentralization as well \nas through establishing new functions (e.g., regulation, environment and social safeguards, and \nNRW management) and enhancing and upgrading the existing functions (e.g., planning and \ndesign). It is important to note that more autonomous centers can be piloted in RSCs in relation \nto operation and maintenance, human resource, and finance and procurement. The NWSDB \nheadquarters will need to enhance the functions of quality control, monitoring, auditing, and \ncoordination. As the first step, the TA will help the government set up a regulatory division within \nNWSDB to initiate sector regulatory function over the decentralized autonomous RSCs. The \ndivision will be responsible for drafting amendments to the NWSDB Act and proposing\u2014in \nanticipation  of  an  independent  sector  regulator  being  established\u2014an  initial  set  of  sector \nregulations that takes into account the need for interaction and cooperation with the Ministry of \nWater Supply and Drainage and the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka. 9 The TA will \nintroduce  appropriate  regulations,  set  up  a  relevant  regulation  structure,  and  establish \nnecessary policies and procedures. The regulatory division will also oversee operational service \nquality and monitor the adequacy of the water and wastewater tariff structure. \n \n14.  The  key  TA  outputs  include:  (i)  strengthened  institutional  structure  of  NWSDB \nconcerning  its  functional  and  the  associated  operational  management  system,  and  (ii) \nimplemented training and skills development program for NWSDB. For the first output, the \nrecommended development strategy and restructuring plan and Change management plan will \nbe prepared based on a review of NWSDB\u2019s overall institutional structure which would include \ndecentralization  and  establishment  of  various  divisions,  taking  into  account  the  best \ninternational  practice  in  utility  management  and  challenges  faced  by  NWSDB  to  deliver \nimproved  water  supply  and  sanitation  service  for  a  rapidly  growing  country-wide  urban \npopulation. The knowledge and position baseline, and decentralized time bound plan need to be \ndeveloped.  For the second output, the TA will support enhanced awareness and consensus on \n                                                \n9  The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka was established in 2003 to technically regulate Sri Lanka\u2019s electricity \nindustry, which may cover utilities with water sector and petroleum industries as well. Currently the commission \nensures that Sri Lanka\u2019s electricity sector has adequate investments, greater availability, efficient supply, and \nimproved quality of services for electricity consumers with an affordable tariff.  ", "4 \nthe need for institutional development and strengthened staff training. This will be achieved \nthrough a consultation workshop on NWSDB institutional enhancement to be organized with \nparticipation of more than 50 stakeholders. In addition, Training needs assessment and training \nplan  will  be  developed.  Key  staff  members  for  both  enhancement  divisions  and  new \nestablishment divisions under the executing and implementing agencies will be trained. The \ntraining will include geographic information system software applications, trainers\u2019 training for \nengineers, and organizing key decision makers and managerial and technical staff to visit well-\nstructured and well-managed water utilities in other countries for exposure to international best \npractice in utility operation. Both in the workshop and training, about 30% of participants will be \nfemale. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented to achieve these outcomes through (i) helping ensure that \nNWSDB is effectively and efficiently managed through enhancing its institutional structure, (ii) \nimproving  NWSDB  staff  capacity  to  implement  and  manage  water  supply  and  sanitation \nprojects, (iii) improving the quality of water supply and sanitation service operations, and (iv) \ndeveloping the capacity of staff employed in all relevant divisions of the NWSDB (e.g., planning \nand design, environment and social, regulatory, and NRW) to implement and manage both \nlocal- and foreign-funded projects. \n \n16.  The basic assumption is that the government and NWSDB will remain committed to \nstrengthening NWSDB and making it more efficient and accountable in the water and sanitation \nsector across the country. It is also assumed that the government will provide budgetary support \nto the new divisions and the regulatory body, and assurance for staff security of tenure. Another \nassumption is that the government will approve the proposed amendments to the NWSDB Act \nand the initial set of sector regulations. In addition, both the board of directors and the labor \nunion will have no objections to the enhancement in the new institutional structure.  \n \n17.  The main risk is that trained staff with high technical skills in planning, design, and \ngeographic  information  system  mapping  will  be  transferred  to  other  divisions  under  the \nconventional promotion system. The TA will need to include criteria for long-term stay of staff in \nthe relevant divisions and ensure knowledge transfer if reassignment of the TA trained staff \ncannot be avoided. The TA may also introduce a bond arrangement with the trained staff prior \nto their participating in the TA training programs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff including in-house institutional expert, office \naccommodation, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The executing agency will be the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage. The ministry \nwill provide overall policy guidance and oversight for the TA. The implementing agency will be \nNWSDB,  which  will  manage  TA  activities.  As  a  long-term  partner  of  ADB,  NWSDB  has \nadequate capacity to manage and implement the TA in accordance with ADB operational policy \nand procedural requirements.  \n ", "5 \n20.  The TA will be implemented over a 3-year period from July 2015 to June 2018. The TA \nrequires consulting services totaling 70 person-months (27 person-months international and 43 \nperson-months national). The international consultants will provide expertise in water utility \nmanagement, water sector institution and finances, water and wastewater regulation, water and \nwastewater planning and design, environment, social safeguards, and NRW management. The \nnational consultants will provide support on water utility management, water sector institution \nand finances, water and wastewater regulation, water and wastewater design and planning, and \nenvironment, social safeguards, legal, and training coordination. In addition to  consultants, \nresource  persons  may  be  invited  to  speak  at  workshops  to  provide  the  latest  knowledge \nconcerning water utility and institutional development matters. The TA will engage 15 experts: 7 \ninternational consultants and 8 national consultants under a consultant firm. \n \n21.  ADB  will  engage  the  consultants  and  resource  persons  in  accordance  with  the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). ADB inputs will be \nthe provision of consultants to carry out the TA. Experts in utility organization and regulation, \nand with hands-on experience in the analysis and development of utility structures will be \nengaged. ADB will engage a consultant firm for the duration of the TA. A draft outline terms of \nreference for the TA consultants is provided in Appendix 3. The consultant firm will be selected \nusing quality- and cost-based selection, with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10, and full technical \nproposals. The disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n22.  The team of consultants will submit four major reports: (i) an inception report within 2 \nmonths after contract commencement date, (ii) an interim report within 1 year after contract \ncommencement date, (iii) a draft report 30 months after contract commencement date, and (iv) \na final report after the receipt of comments from government and ADB on the draft report.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  for  Institutional  Development  of  National  Water  Supply  and \nDrainage Board, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
