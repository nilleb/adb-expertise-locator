THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for subprogram 3 of the Sustainable \nEnergy Sector Reform Program.1 \n \n2.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  programmatic  approach  and \nsubprogram 1 in April 2014, and subprogram 2 in November 2015. The program supports the \nNational Power Policy, 2013 of the Government of Pakistan, which seeks to build an affordable, \nreliable, sustainable, and secure energy sector to support the country\u2019s economic growth.2 The \nprogram, fully coordinated with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under its extended fund \nfacility,3 takes a phased approach over multiple years to provide dynamic, long-term support to \nmultidimensional reforms, with subprograms that match the government\u2019s budget cycle. The \nIMF completed its final review in September 2016.4 The World Bank and Japan International \nCooperation  Agency  (JICA)  cofinanced  subprograms  1  and  2,  and  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement (AFD) will cofinance subprogram 3, which is the third and final year of the \nprogrammatic approach5 and builds on the reforms initiated during previous subprograms. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Economic reforms are a priority of the Government of Pakistan. In 2017, the World Bank \nrecognized Pakistan as among the countries with the most improved business environment.6 \nAfter 10 failed attempts, Pakistan successfully completed an IMF program in 2016. Apart from \nminor deviations, the results of the program were promising: (i) during FY2016, the economy \ngrew by 4.7%, above the global growth of 3.1%; (ii) inflation was 0.8%, well below the IMF \ntarget of 4.0%; and (iii) the foreign reserves had more than doubled since June 2013.7 The IMF \nbelieves that as structural reforms take hold, bottlenecks will ease, growth will accelerate, and \nvulnerabilities will recede. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Water and Power (MOWP). 2013.

Manila. \n3  On 4 September 2013, the IMF board approved a $6.7 billion, 36-month program under IMF\u2019s extended fund \nfacility to reduce the inflation rate in Pakistan and lower the country\u2019s fiscal deficit to a sustainable level.

All \nresult indicators have been met or substantially met except for one (footnote 24). \n6  World Bank.

IMF  Country  Report.  No. 16/325. Washington,  DC. \nhttps://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=44327.0. As of the end of FY2016, Pakistan\u2019s gross public \ndebt stood at 66.5% of gross domestic product (GDP), while its net public debt was 60.2% of GDP. Under the \nFiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act, 2005 (as amended), the government must reduce public debt to 60% \nof estimated GDP by FY2018, and progressively reduce public debt to 50% of GDP during a 15-year transition \nperiod. \n ", "2 \n4.  Energy data also demonstrate the positive results of the reforms: (i) load shedding in \nurban areas was reduced from 12 hours in FY2013 to 6 hours in FY2015; (ii) electricity losses \nwere reduced, while collections increased; and (iii) better fuel management helped cut power \ngeneration costs. However, Pakistan\u2019s electricity generation capacity is about 5,500 megawatts \nshort, and the inadequate energy supply has been a constraint to the economy. Further, only \ntwo-thirds  of  the  population  have  access  to  power.8 Despite  the  improvements,  persistent \nblackouts and brownouts negatively affect investor confidence and economic growth. \n \n5.  Resolving energy problems require massive investments that cannot be accomplished \nsolely by the state, even with assistance from development partners. The financing gap can only \nbe closed by improving self-financing capacity and by attracting private investments globally. \nSector reforms are crucial for enhancing the business environment for long-term investments. \n \n6.  Since the 1990s, Pakistan has taken steps to restructure and improve its energy sector, \nbut  the  results  have  been  mixed  and  the  expected  outcomes  were  not  always  achieved. \nPrevious reforms led to the unbundling of the Water and Power Development Authority into \n15 corporatized entities: nine regional power distribution companies (DISCOs), four thermal \npower generation companies (GENCOs), the National Transmission and Despatch Company \n(NTDC), and the Water and Power Development Authority. Central Power Purchasing Agency \nGuarantee Limited (CPPA-G), the country\u2019s sole buyer and seller of electricity, used to be a unit \nwithin NTDC but became an independent corporate entity in 2015. The government fully owns \nall these companies except for the Karachi Electric Supply Company, which was privatized in \n2005. Independent power producers generate 56% of the country\u2019s power. The National Electric \nPower Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), established in 1997, sets tariffs, issues licenses, and \nregulates the sector. \n \n7.  In 2013, the government settled PRs480 billion in electricity payment arrears (circular \ndebt).9 Since that time, arrears have accumulated at a slower pace, reaching PRs321 billion by \nthe end of FY2016, slightly above the target set in  subprogram 2.10 Major causes of this \ncontinued  accumulation  include  (i)  the  ambiguity  in  legislation,  which  has  blocked  the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to introduce surcharges and other policy decisions to boost the sector\u2019s \nfinancial sustainability; and (ii) delays in the privatization of the DISCOs. In addition, various \nentities are challenging over 1,300 of NEPRA\u2019s decisions, including those related to surcharges, \nin court. Since an average case has a 7-year life span, court challenges add uncertainty to the \ninvestment climate. Public disclosure of the sector\u2019s operational and financial information has \nimproved, but misinterpretation of sector data is often used for political purposes. \n \n8.  The government is expecting significant investments in Pakistan\u2019s energy sector. The \nChina\u2013Pakistan Economic Corridor initiative has attracted $33 billion in investments through \n2022, primarily for electricity generation and transmission.11 Of this amount, about 80% is from \nprivate investors. Decisive reforms are needed to (i) further reduce the gap between end-user \nand cost-recovery tariffs,12 (ii) streamline the sector\u2019s legal and regulatory environment; and \n(iii) institutionalize information disclosure. \n                                                \n8  National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA). 2016.

Energy Priority Projects. http://cpec.gov.pk/energy. \n12 The gap between end-user and cost-recovery tariffs is the difference between (i) cost-recovery and NEPRA-\ndetermined  tariffs;  and  (ii)  NEPRA-determined  and  government-notified  tariffs,  which  are  balanced  through \nsubsidies. \n ", "3 \n9.  Tariff  and  subsidies.  A  primary  goal  of  the  program  is  to  improve  the  financial \nsustainability of the energy sector. Electricity subsidies introduced by previous governments \nsurged to 1.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) in FY2013. A time lag in determining tariffs \ndelayed  the  reflection  of  current  costs  in  electricity  prices.  These  factors,  combined  with \nlegislative constraints that prevent policy actions from recognizing higher losses and lower \ncollections in areas with security concerns, have led to insufficient financial resources to fully \npay for electricity and fuel supply, exacerbating the circular debt problem. \n \n10.  The program is intended to help the government remove these financial constraints. In \n2014, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) approved the National Power Tariff and \nSubsidy Policy Guidelines, which eliminated subsidies for industrial, commercial, and residential \nconsumers that use more than 300 kilowatt-hours per month. As a result, subsidies decreased \nto 0.8% of GDP in FY2015 and 0.7% in FY2016; a further decrease to 0.4% of GDP is \nenvisaged for FY2017. The subsidies were focused to benefit the poor and the middle class, \nand further cuts are subject to the social considerations. Under the previous subprograms, \nNEPRA approved multiyear tariff guidelines and all DISCOs submitted 5-year investment plans, \nwhich is the first step under the multiyear tariff mechanism to reduce the overall time required \nfor tariff determinations. The first multiyear tariffs were determined in subprogram 3 (para. 24). \n \n11.  In October 2014, the government introduced surcharges to service the debt obligations \nassumed by Power Holding Company Limited (PHCL)13 as part of a previous effort by the \ngovernment to clear accumulated circular debt. These surcharges were stayed by the Lahore \nHigh Court because of ambiguity in legislation. In June 2015, the Supreme Court allowed the \nreinstatement of the surcharges until a final decision is issued. The legislative changes under \nsubprogram 3 eliminate the ambiguity in the law and therefore ensure that the government can \nsecure revenue sources for the sector by imposing surcharges when required (para. 23). \n \n12.  Sector performance and private sector participation. Government initiatives requiring \nDISCOs  to  protect  revenues  and  commit  to  operational  and  financial  targets  under \nperformance-based contracts resulted in an increase in electricity bill collections from 86.0% in \nFY2013 to 94.4% in FY2016, and a reduction of losses from 21.9% to 17.8% in the same \nperiod. Further improvements can be achieved through investments that are supported by ADB \nand other development partners.14 A key achievement under the previous subprograms was to \nseparate the commercial settlement functions of the Central Power Purchasing Agency from the \nNTDC, the grid\u2019s technical operator. The CPPA-G buys electricity on behalf of DISCOs, but it is \nenvisaged to expand into Pakistan\u2019s wholesale electricity market. Further operationalization of \nthe  CPPA-G  was  supported  under  subprogram  3  through  NEPRA\u2019s  approval  of  a  market \noperator fee for CPPA-G activities (paras. 25 and 27).15 \n \n13.  Energy-efficiency awareness in Pakistan is low. Through subprogram 2, the government \ndeveloped  energy-efficiency  guidelines  and  labels  for  three  energy-intensive  types  of \n                                                \n13 The government created the PHCL in 2009 to issue indebtedness that was used to pay off the debt accumulated \nby DISCOs, GENCOs, the NTDC, and other energy sector entities. In 2009, PRs226 billion was transferred from \nthese entities to the PHCL. In 2015, PHCL\u2019s debt increased to PRs335 billion and has since remained unchanged. \n14 ADB. 2015.

Manila. \n ", "4 \nappliances.  Subprogram  3  further  institutionalized  energy  efficiency  and  conservation  by \npassing legislation that promotes energy efficiency and conservation (para. 26). \n \n14.  Because of civil unrest, the government suspended ambitious plans to privatize DISCOs \nand GENCOs through strategic sales. However, under subprogram 3, the government took an \nalternative approach to improving efficiency in electricity enterprises by initiating steps toward \nthe public offering of minority interest in three DISCOs (para. 25). \n \n15.  The program supports the government\u2019s initiative to reduce the country\u2019s dependence on \nimported fuel through the development of the domestic gas subsector. The greater use of fuel \nthrough economic growth has resulted in increased imports and balance-of-payment issues, \nwhich constrains further growth. Reforms in the electricity and gas subsectors are crucial in \nresolving  the  link  between  growth  and  fuel  imports.  Subprograms  1  and  2  supported  the \nimplementation  of  the  Petroleum  Exploration  and  Production  Policy,  2012  by  introducing \ncompetitive gas pricing for existing and new gas concessions.16 Subprogram 3 initiated the \ncorporate restructuring of the state gas subsector and the regulatory environment to respond to \nmarket needs (para. 28). \n \n16.  Accountability and transparency. Before the program, the state-owned power utilities \ndid  not  systematically  share  Pakistan\u2019s  electricity  information  with  the  public  or  other \nstakeholders. However, through previous subprograms, (i) the NTDC created web-based open \naccess to operational information; (ii) DISCOs began publishing monthly billing and collection \ndata; (iii) NEPRA has been analyzing and publishing the performance of DISCOs since 2011; \nand (iv) the CPPA-G publishes on its website the amounts due and payments made by each \nDISCO to the CPPA-G, and by the CPPA-G to each generator, including arrears. These steps \ncontributed to greater participation of the stakeholders in restructuring the sector. Transparency \nwas further enhanced under subprogram 3 by (i) providing training to the media to improve its \nunderstanding of the operational and financial information disclosed by the sector operators, \nand (ii) publishing the results of NEPRA\u2019s monitoring reviews of these operators (para. 29). \n \n17.  Development coordination. Subprogram 3 was prepared in coordination with the AFD, \nthe IMF, JICA, the World Bank, and other development partners to increase the program\u2019s \noverall economic impact in Pakistan. The development partners coordinated closely on the \nproposed  amendments  to  the  Regulation  of  Generation,  Transmission  and  Distribution  of \nElectric Power Act, 1997, commonly known as the NEPRA Act, to ensure that they reflect best \npractices for oversight and regulation of energy sector operations. \n \n18.  Lessons.  The  National  Power  Policy17 and  the  programmatic  approach  follow  the \nrecommendations of the Friends of Democratic Pakistan Energy Sector Task Force, which ADB \nco-chaired with the government.18 Through the Energy Sector Restructuring Program, ADB \nsupported the initiation of key sector reforms in 2000.19 Energy sector reforms were also part of \nthe Accelerating Economic Transformation Program in 2008 and 2009.20 Lessons related to the \n                                                \n16 Since the beginning of the program, the government has signed 46 new gas concessions and 105 supplementary \nagreements. \n17 Government of Pakistan, MOWP. 2013.

Link to country partnership strategy. The program aligns with the priorities of ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for Pakistan, 2015\u20132019, which emphasizes policy reforms and \nstructural  transformation  in  the  energy  sector  to  remove  the  barriers  to  economic  growth, \nstimulate job creation, and improve macroeconomic and political sustainability.21 The program is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for Pakistan.22 Reform policy \nactions will contribute to knowledge-related issues, which align with the midterm review of \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020.23 Taking  a  holistic  approach to  the  sector,  ADB will  continue  policy \ndialogue through project interventions and may consider further policy-based lending with the \ngovernment after the general elections. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n20.  The impact of the overall program will be a more reliable, sustainable, and secure \nenergy sector that supports the country\u2019s economic growth. The outcome will be an improved \nreliability, sustainability, and affordability of the energy system. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n21.  All fourteen policy conditions for subprogram 3 were attained in the period from January \n2016 till May 2017. The dynamics of the reform program required the revision of some policy \nactions.24 The  entire  program  was  originally  designed  to  support  the  government\u2019s  reform \ninitiatives through five annual subprograms corresponding with the government\u2019s fiscal year, \ncommencing  from  FY2014.  However,  as  it  will  likely  not  be  feasible  to  pursue  additional \nsignificant policy reforms until after the general elections scheduled for mid-2018, subprogram 3 \nis planned as the last for this program. Overall, the program achieved a broader range of \nreforms than initially planned and, as of the end of subprogram 3, most of the result indicators \nfor the entire program, as specified in the policy matrix, had been achieved or partially achieved. \n25 Subprogram 3 delivered three outputs. \n \n22.  Output 1: Tariffs and subsidies managed. The main objective of this output was to \npropose legislative changes that will allow the government to address the financial sustainability \nissues of the sector. On 2 May 2017 the Council of Common Interests approved amendments to \none of the fundamental laws of the energy sector, the NEPRA Act, and submitted them to \nParliament  for  consideration.  This  major  additional  achievement  of  the  program  (i)  clearly \ndefined the roles of and the functional separation between the government as the policy maker \nand  NEPRA  as  the  sector  regulator,  (ii)  improved  the  decision-making  process  and \naccountability of the government as a policy maker and NEPRA as a sector regulator, (iii) \nclarified the definition and applicability of surcharges, and (iv) established the foundation for the \n                                                                                                                                                       \nProgram.

Approval of the NEPRA Act amendments will enable the government to update the 2015 \ncircular debt management plan, which placed clearance of the stock of the debt entirely on the \nproceeds generated by the proposed strategic sale of  electricity enterprises to the private \nsector.  After  parliamentary  ratification, these  amendments,  taken  together  with  the  sale  of \nminority stakes in certain DISCOs through public offerings, will allow the government to reduce \nthe flow and stock of the debt, which stood at PRs374 billion at the end of December 2016. The \nupdated plan has different scenarios to manage circular debt. Application of surcharges starting \nfrom 2019 are expected to reduce the stock to PRs240 billion by the end of FY2021, and the \ncombination of full cost-recovery tariff and surcharges could bring it down to PRs65 billion by \nthe end of FY2021. The amended act will also allow the government to impose surcharges for \nenvironmental  protection,  energy  efficiency,  demand  management,  climate  change \nmanagement, and energy supply security. \n \n24.  In 2016, NEPRA issued determinations on multiyear tariffs for three DISCOs and annual \ntariffs for all remaining DISCOs. However, as with other tariff determinations, eight DISCOs \nchallenged the determinations in court (para. 7). Following a practice of other jurisdictions \naround the world, the proposed NEPRA Act amendments would introduce an appellate tribunal \nto deal with the issue. The tribunal would be subject to strict deadlines to review appeals of \nNEPRA\u2019s decisions and, if found to have merit, would return the case to NEPRA for further \naction consistent with the decision. NEPRA, in turn, would be bound by strict timelines to \nreconsider  its  decisions.  The  time-bound  mechanism  aims  to  substantially  reduce  the \nprocessing time of future appeals. \n \n25.  Output 2: Sector performance and market access for private sector participation \nimproved.  The change to the electricity structure  supported under subprogram 2  required \nrevisions to the security package offered to new investors in the electricity subsector and a \nnovation  of  the  existing  commercial  agreements.  The  government  bifurcated  nine  power \npurchase agreements and transferred commercial responsibilities from the NTDC to the CPPA-\nG.27 On 28 April 2017, the ECC approved and published the new security package. In addition, \nthe  government  merged  the Alternative  Energy  Development  Board and the  Private  Power \nInfrastructure Board, both established to promote private sector participation in the electricity \nsubsector but for different scales and types of energy, for operational efficiency purposes.28 The \ngovernment was planning to improve operational efficiency of the DISCOs through strategic \nsale, however, the original privatization plan required a revision as a result of public resistance. \nForced as an alternative solution, in 2016 the Cabinet Committee on Privatization approved \ninitiating the steps toward a public offering of a minority interest in three DISCOs. \n \n26.  Efficiency is pursued by the government in other areas as well. Based on the foundation \ncreated by previous subprograms, the government passed the National Energy Efficiency and \nConservation Act into law in July 2016. The act established the National Energy Efficiency and \nConservation Authority, which develops mandatory energy-efficiency labels and recommends \nstandards, carries out energy audits; prohibits the manufacture, sale, or import of equipment \nthat is not energy efficient; and imposes fines for using energy-intensive appliances. \n                                                \n26 NEPRA Act amendments were submitted for parliamentary ratification in May 2017. \n27 The remaining agreements will be gradually novated as permits and licenses expire. \n28 The federal government approved the amendments to the Private Power Investment Board Act, 2012 on 27 April \nand submitted them for parliamentary ratification on 19 May 2017. \n ", "7 \n27.  Anticipating the increase in electricity participants and the development of a competitive \npower market, NEPRA established the Electricity Sector Market Operations Unit in July 2016 \nand approved a market operator fee for the CPPA-G in January 2017. Separately, in response \nto demand, NEPRA developed transmission tariff guidelines that were published in April 2017. \n \n28.  After the successful application of the Petroleum Policy, 2012 in subprograms 1 and 2, \nthe Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources (MPNR) directed its attention to  the gas \nsubsector. On 9 September 2016, the MPNR adopted a mid- and downstream gas subsector \nrestructuring plan, which was prepared with World Bank support. As a first stage, the MPNR has \ncompleted  the  operational  and  accounting  unbundling  of  the  transmission  and  distribution \nbusinesses of Sui Northern and Sui Southern companies. Legal unbundling is expected to be \ncompleted by the end of FY2018. To ensure the adequacy of the new structure, on 11 August \n2016, the MPNR initiated a review of the roles and responsibilities of upstream and downstream \nregulatory agencies. \n \n29.  Output 3: Accountability and transparency in power subsector achieved. During \nFY2016  and  part  of  FY2017,  NEPRA  published  performance  evaluation  reports  on  public \nGENCOs,  DISCOs,  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Company,  and  NTDC  compliance  with  license \nprovisions. However, energy sector data is complex and often misunderstood by media. In May \n2017,  the  Ministry  of Water  and  Power  (MOWP),  together  with  other  sector stakeholders, \nconducted the first media training on how to use and interpret sector data disclosed on the \nwebsites of the NTDC, the CPPA-G, DISCOs, and the ministry itself. Media training of this type \nis expected to become a regular activity. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n30.  ADB  approved  and  disbursed  subprogram  1  as  a  single-tranche  loan  of \nSDR257,443,000 ($400 million equivalent) in April 2014. ADB approved and disbursed two \nloans in December 2015 under subprogram 2: (i) a loan of SDR213,543,000 ($300 million \nequivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, and (ii) a loan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources. These loans were used to fund the government\u2019s budgetary needs \nfor FY2014 and FY2016. The policy matrix (Appendix 4) lists actions taken prior to Board \nconsideration  for  subprograms  1\u20133.  The  government  has  requested  a  regular  loan  of \n$300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance subprogram 3.29 The loan will \nhave a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. Based on the custom amortization method, the average maturity is 10.45 \nyears, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The AFD will provide collaborative \ncofinancing for subprogram 3 in the form of a loan in the amount of \u20ac100 million. The AFD loan \nwill have a 20-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; and an annual interest rate based \non the 6-month euro LIBOR plus 55 basis points (floating), with an appraisal fee of 0.25% and \nno  commitment  charges.  The  programmatic  approach  will  support  reforms  outlined  in  the \ndevelopment policy letter (Appendix 3) and the policy matrix (Appendix 4). \n \n31.  The subprogram 3 loan is for general budget support and does not finance any specific \nbudget  item.  The  amount  of  the  loan  for  subprogram  3  was  determined  based  on  the \n                                                \n29 The initial amount of subprogram 3 as contemplated in subprogram 1 (ADB. 2014. Report and Recommendation of \nthe President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Programmatic Approach and Policy-Based Loan for Subprogram \n1 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Sustainable Energy Sector Reform Program. Manila) was $150 million. \nThe increase in the loan amount is justified by the additional accomplishments of the reform program (footnote 24). \n ", "8 \ngovernment\u2019s  financing  needs  until  the  results  of  the  reforms  are  fully  realized.  The \ngovernment\u2019s internal procedures will require about 6 months before legislative changes in the \nNEPRA Act are reflected in the notified tariffs. Meanwhile, the government will have to support \nthe cost of excess losses and lower collections, which for the 6 months are estimated at \nPRs55 billion. Total ADB financing and cofinancing under subprogram 3 is PRs42.6 billion. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n32.  The ECC is the final government authority on the reforms. The Ministry of Finance is the \nprogram\u2019s executing agency, supported by a program coordination unit (PCU). The PCU has \noverall responsibility for coordinating program monitoring and reporting. The MPNR and MOWP \nare the implementing agencies, supported by their monitoring units established under previous \nsubprograms.  Each  monitoring  unit  is  responsible  for  program  reporting  and  discussing \nimplementation issues with the PCU. The monitoring units submit reports to the ECC, which are \nalso provided to ADB and cofinanciers.30 The technical assistance to support the program is \nprovided by ADB, JICA, the United States Agency for International Development, the World \nBank, and other development partners through their ongoing and new initiatives. The proceeds \nof the policy-based loan will be withdrawn following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, \nas amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n33.  The proposed policy reforms under the program will support economic growth through \nincreased energy investments by tapping private funding sources, which will be achieved by the \nprogram\u2019s outputs and outcome. \n \n34.  Circular debt is the major financial issue in the power subsector. As of the end of \nDecember 2016, payables to power producers and fuel suppliers amounted to PRs374 billion. \nThis represents an increase of about 80% from the end of FY2013 after the PRs480 billion \nclearance. Despite improvements in the subsector\u2019s performance, the remaining losses and \ncollection issues, and the gap between NEPRA-determined tariffs and actual cost-recovery \nlevels continue to hamper DISCOs\u2019 ability to make full power purchase payments. In the first \nquarter of FY2017, the reflection of higher capacity charges from a settlement of royalty issues \nwith provincial governments contributed to a rapid increase in generation costs and circular \ndebt. As the subsector suffers from a chronic shortage of funds, it remains vulnerable to these \nunplanned events. A sound regulatory framework that allows for full cost-recovery tariffs, a \ndispute  settlement  mechanism,  and  surcharges  when  required,  which  the  NEPRA  Act \namendment  tries  to  establish,  will  be  key  to  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  subsector \n(para. 23). \n \n35.  The government has successfully reduced the amount of electricity subsidies during the \nprogram, which overlapped with the IMF program period. Electricity subsidies in FY2016 were \nPRs171 billion, significantly less than PRs292 billion in FY2014 and PRs221 billion in FY2015.31 \nThe key factor in controlling the amount of electricity subsidies was the introduction of tariff \nrationalization surcharges as a cross-subsidy mechanism in different parts of the country. With \nthe  surcharges  in  place,  the  government  estimates  FY2017  electricity  subsidies  to  be \n                                                \n30 Technical Memorandum (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance. 2015. Federal Budget 2015\u201316: Budget in Brief. Islamabad. \n ", "9 \nPRs118 billion, or about 0.4% of GDP. Clarity on the government\u2019s power to introduce required \nsurcharges through NEPRA Act amendments therefore plays a key role in managing subsidies. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n36.  In line with its Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan,32 ADB conducted a \ngovernance, institutional, and corruption risk assessment in 2015 as part of the preparation of \nthe country partnership strategy for Pakistan. In the assessment, Pakistan\u2019s score for various \ngovernance indicators fell below the regional average in 2012. However, the country has made \nprogress  in  improving  accountability,  increasing  transparency,  and  raising  efficiency.  The \ngovernment  has  embarked  on  several  reforms  to  strengthen  the  institutional  framework, \nincluding budget management, financial accounting, and reporting and expenditure controls. As \npart of the IMF extended fund facility, the government has changed its tax policy to increase \ntransparency.  In  September  2016,  Pakistan  became  signatory  to  OECD\u2019s  Multilateral \nConvention  on  Mutual  Administrative  Assistance  in  Tax  Matters,  which  aims  to  tackle  tax \nevasion and avoidance through adoption of international best practices. Overall improvement in \nthe governance system resulted in the improved credit rating of Pakistan.33 Since 2014 focus \nhas been on capacity building and training at the federal and provincial levels. A fiduciary risk \nassessment found that overall fiduciary risk at the federal level remains medium to high despite \nprogress observed in individual areas about public expenditure and financial accountability \nassessment. Internal control and audit requires improvements, as does the legislative oversight \nof budget formulation and execution. Although the institutional setup for public procurement has \nbeen established, the government has to make additional efforts to augment the capacity and \nbudgets  of  the  procurement  authorities.  To  support  the  government\u2019s  public  financial \nmanagement  reforms,  initiatives  financed  by  various  development  partners  should  be \ncoordinated and complementary. \n \n37.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government. The government is acting against corruption, which includes monitoring \nand reporting work by the public accounts committee of Parliament. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n38.  The reforms supported under the program will accelerate economic growth and help \ncreate jobs, which are key to reducing poverty. Reliable power will benefit poor and vulnerable \nconsumers, including hospitals and schools, which are hit hard by inadequate power supply, \nload shedding, and poor power quality. Small industries will be able to operate for more hours \nper day and thereby increase productivity, which in turn will create more work opportunities for \nthe poor. Increases in the Human Development Index are strongly correlated with access to \ncommercial electricity supplies. The indirect benefits of a reliable energy supply include reduced \nwork time and improved health of household members through a reduction of fume-related \nindoor pollution, and water- and food-borne diseases through refrigeration and boiling of water \nand food. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n39.  The  subprogram  has  been  assessed  category  C  for  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples. Policy actions to be supported under the subprogram are \n                                                \n32 ADB. 2006. Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan (GACAP II).

RECOMMENDATION \n \n42.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, \nunder the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the \nBoard approve the loan of $300,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for subprogram 3 of \nthe Sustainable Energy Sector Reform Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in \nregular  terms,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \nStephen Groff \nVice-President \n25 May 2017\n                                                \n34 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Program is aligned with \nMore  reliable,  sustainable,  and  secure  energy  sector  that  supports  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth \nattained (National Power Policy, 2013)a \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nReliability,  a.
