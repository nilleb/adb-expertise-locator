Most of the large water sector investments have also been \nmade in this river basin. However, water sector planning, development, \nand  management  have  been  suboptimal.  To  effectively  exploit  the \nconsiderable  potential  of  this  resource,  the  Government  adopted \nintegrated water resource management (IWRM) by establishing the Water \nResources  Coordination  Committee  (WRCC)  in  1998.  The  proposed \nProject will help the Government implement IWRM by (i) fostering and \ninstitutionalizing it in the Government\u2019s mainstream management process, \nand  (ii)  supporting  investment  interventions  in  relatively  degraded \nwatersheds of NNRB to provide sustainable livelihood opportunities for the \npoor ethnic groups. \n   \nRationale  In the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), water is vital for the \n  country\u2019s economic development, which is mainly based on agricultural \nproduction and hydropower generation. Agriculture contributes about 40%, \nand hydropower another 30% to total foreign exchange earnings. About \n90%  of  the  population  depends  on  agriculture.  Optimal  use  of  water \nresources is critical to realizing the Government\u2019s strategic objectives of \npoverty reduction and sustainable economic growth. Water resources in \nthe  Lao  PDR  also  have  regional  significance:  over  35%  of  the  total \nMekong River flow is generated in Lao PDR watersheds. In the past few \nyears, the Government has introduced various legislative and institutional \nmeasures to manage water resources efficiently and effectively. In 1996, \nthe Water Law was approved, and in 1998, the WRCC was established \nwith a mandate to coordinate the activities of line agencies involved in \nwater  sector  management.  In  2001,  a  prime  ministerial  decree  was \napproved to implement the Water Law. To foster IWRM, the Government \nhas focused on key areas in agriculture and hydropower to optimize the \nwater resources. However, the most significant institutional problem in the \nwater sector is the inadequate coordination among key central agencies \nand provincial departments. Twelve central agencies are directly involved \nin water sector management while another 10 have a direct interest in it. \nSince two provinces, the capital, and a special zone share NNRB, they \nalso have a direct stake in its water resource management. A functional \nmechanism to coordinate and implement IWRM at central and provincial \nlevels is not yet in place as WRCC requires further capacity building and \nresource mobilization. In particular, a system needs to be developed at \ncommunity,  district,  and  provincial  levels  so  that  water  resource \nmanagement  can  become  efficient  and  equitable  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s policy of decentralized planning.   NNRB is one of the  most   ", "iv  \n  important  river  basins  in  the  country,  with  a  150  megawatts  (MW) \nhydropower generation project and more are planned. However, the Nam \nNgum  reservoir  is  not  efficiently  managed,  resulting  in  suboptimal \nhydropower  generation  and  inefficient  maintenance  of  downstream \nriverine ecosystems. Although the annual water flow per capita or per unit \nof land gives an impression of abundant water resources in NNRB, the \nseasonal nature of rainfall and interriver water transfers create seasonal \nand  spatial  water  shortages.  An  intersectoral  water  allocation  plan  to \naddress these issues is not yet in place.  While it is not yet a problem, \nwater quality needs to be monitored closely as agriculture is intensive \nupstream.  Effective  water  management  will  require  developing  and \napplying skills and technology to improve reservoir management. At the \nsame  time,  the  subwatersheds  in  the  upper  basin  are  critical  for \nsustainable  development.  These  subwatersheds  contain  important \nbiodiversity and are home to ethnic groups, who are among the poorest in \nthe country. Many of these subwatersheds are already under pressure \nfrom agriculture that is based on shifting cultivation and exploitation of \nforest products. At current use levels, these activities are unsustainable. \nTo ensure long-term sustainability of the upper basin subwatersheds and \nthe  livelihood  opportunities  they  offer,  an  integrated  development \napproach ought to be fostered among farming communities, line agencies, \nand departments. By implementing a variety of integrated activities, the \nProject will provide an impetus to that end. \n   \nObjectives and  Optimal use of water resources in the country is the long-term goal of the \nScope  Project. Two immediate objectives of the Project are to (i) foster and \ninstitutionalize  IWRM  in  the  mainstream  management  process  of  the \nGovernment at the central, provincial, and district levels; and (ii) support \ninvestment interventions in relatively degraded parts of NNRB to ensure \nsustainable  watershed  management  and  to  provide  livelihood \nopportunities for the poor and ethnic groups. The Project has three main \ncomponents:  (i)  IWRM,  (ii)  reservoir  management  and  river  basin \nmodeling, and (iii) watershed management. The first will strengthen the \ncapacity  of  the  WRCC  to  be  more  effective  as  a  water  resource \ncoordination body at the central level and, through the NNRB Committee \n(NNRBC), at the provincial level. The second component will help the \nMinistry  of  Industry  and  Handicraft  (MIH)  devise  a  more  effective \nmanagement regime for the Nam Ngum 1 reservoir to optimize power \ngeneration, mitigate floods, and improve water use efficiency in NNRB. \nThe  third  will  (i)  strengthen  capacity  of  the  Integrated  Watershed \nManagement Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) and its \nrelevant provincial and district departments, (ii) increase crop productivity \nand irrigation efficiency, (iii) improve livestock and fisheries management, \nand (iv) preserve and restore forest resources. \n   \nCost Estimates  The project cost, including contingencies, taxes, and duties, is estimated \nat $23.0 million equivalent, consisting of a foreign exchange cost of $9.4 \nmillion (41%) and local currency cost of $13.6 million (59%) equivalent.

Three project implementation units, one \neach, in the WRCC, Hydropower Office of MIH, and National Agricultural \nand Forestry Extension Service of MAF, headed by project coordinators, \nhave also been established to implement their respective components. A \nproject  performance  management  unit  in  ONPM  will  monitor  project \nprogress. Specific investment interventions in the selected subprojects will \nbe planned and implemented by the provincial departments in cooperation \nwith the NNRBC. \n   \nProcurement  Goods and services, financed by the loan, will be procured in accordance \nwith  the  ADB  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Vehicles,  equipment,  civil \nworks, and material will be procured by international competitive bidding \nwhere the cost is more than $500,000, or by international shopping where \nthe cost is from $100,000 to $500,000. Vehicles, equipment, civil works, \nand material valued at less than $100,000 equivalent, and for which there \nare  several  local  suppliers  with  satisfactory  service  facilities,  may  be \nprocured under local competitive procedures, or through direct purchase. ", "vi  \nConsulting  To  support  project  implementation  and  capacity  building,  239  person-\nServices  months of international and 413 person-months of domestic consulting \nservices  will  be  required.  Consulting  services  will  be  recruited  in  two \npackages.  ADB  will  finance  one  package  of  137  person-months  of \ninternational  and  201  person-months  of  domestic  consultants.  An \ninternational firm, in association with a domestic firm, will be engaged to \nprovide  the  required  support  as  per  ADB  Guidelines  for  the  Use  of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. The Agence \nFrancaise  de  Developpement  (AFD)  will  finance,  in  parallel,  another \npackage of 102 person-months of international and 212 person-months of \ndomestic  consulting  services.  Consultants  for  this  package  will  be \nrecruited as per AFD procedures. All consultants will work following a \nconsolidated work plan and reporting to the single team leader engaged \nunder the ADB package. \n   \nProject Benefits  At the national level, project benefits will arise from optimal use of water \nand Beneficiaries  resources by institutionalizing IWRM. A strengthened WRCC will be able \nto effectively coordinate water resource management among different line \nagencies. Efficient operation of the Nam Ngum 1 reservoir will provide an \nadditional 2% or 20 gigawatt hours of hydropower (worth $600,000) per \nyear, mitigate floods, and improve water conservation. Other benefits will \nstem from the efficient use of water in agriculture, leading to increased \nproductivity  and  household  incomes.  Adoption  of  improved  land-use \npractices will maintain the water quality in the long run. At the grassroots, \nsubprojects will target poor communities in the upper basin and greatly \nbenefit ethnic groups and women. Through crop improvement, livestock \nand fishery management, and restoration forestry household incomes will \nincrease significantly while maintaining sustainable livelihood systems and \nthe environment. A household\u2019s annual non-cash income is expected to \nincrease by 34%; from $650 to $935, and cash income would increase by \n5\u20136 fold; from $50 to $355. These benefits will ensure food security and \nprovide cash income for better education and health services. Provision of \nalternative livelihood opportunities will ensure that forest degradation, on \nabout 30,000 ha, is stabilized and shifting cultivation, on another 25,000 \nha,  is  reduced  so  that  land-use  patterns  optimize  water  conservation. \nSince the Project will adopt a sector-lending modality, the exact number of \nbeneficiaries cannot be determined at the outset. By project completion, \naround 10,000 households will have directly benefited of which more than \n25% live below the poverty line. The estimated economic internal rate of \nreturn, for base case, is 24.7% indicating economic viability of the Project.  \n   \nRisks and  The WRCC, Hydropower Office, MAF, and provincial departments are \nAssumptions  short of human resources and receive inadequate budgetary allocations. \nCapacity  building  will  depend  on  finding  resources,  especially  for  the \nWRCC secretariat, for which a significant increase in qualified technical \nstaff is proposed. The investment interventions in agriculture and forestry \ndepend on the capability of the provincial and district staff. The Project will \nhelp by building some aspects of staff capacity, but the success and \nsustainability of the project interventions will depend largely on the overall \nability  and  willingness  of  the  Government  to  plan  and  implement  the \ninterventions in cooperation with local authorities and communities. \n ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Nam Ngum River Basin (NNRB) \nDevelopment Sector Project.1 The project processing chronology is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  The Economy and the Water Sector \n2.  The Lao PDR is a land-locked country spread over about 236,800 square kilometers \n(km2). It has rich and varied natural resources, of which water is the most important. During the \nlast 5 years, the country has achieved an average gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of \nabout 6% per annum and reduced the incidence of poverty from 45% to 39%, which, in light of \nthe  regional  economic  slowdown  in  the  late  1990s,  are  impressive  achievements.  The \nGovernment projects similar economic growth in the next 3 years. Agriculture is the largest \nsector of the economy, accounting for about half of GDP. Over 85% of the country\u2019s 5 million \npeople live in rural areas. About 90% of the rural population lives on subsistence farming and \nmany people also depend on food gathering from forests and rivers. Fish accounts for about \n40% of the animal protein in the national diet. Managing water resources2 effectively and \nefficiently is necessary to reduce poverty and promote economic growth. Agriculture contributes \nabout 40% and hydropower another 30% to total foreign exchange earnings. The Government \nhas planned major expansion of irrigation and hydropower projects to reduce poverty and spur \neconomic growth. These projects will impact on communities in the river basins and on the \nenvironment in general and water resources in particular. Despite the country\u2019s significant \ndependence on water resources, the water sector planning and development process has not \nyet institutionalized integrated water resources management (IWRM) approach, which would \noptimize the returns on hydropower and irrigation investments without compromising the long-\nterm quality of the environment and the well being of local communities. Water resources in the \nLao PDR also have regional significance\u2014over 35% of total Mekong river flow is generated in \nthe country\u2019s watersheds. \n \n3.  In agriculture, the main thrust has been to develop irrigated agriculture to ensure food \nself-sufficiency. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) aims to increase rural incomes \nand stabilize rice productivity and availability by expanding irrigated areas for wet- and dry- \nseason production. Much of the irrigated area development has taken place on the floodplain of \nNNRB, which is adjacent to the capital, Vientiane. Expansion of irrigated area coupled with \ndissemination of modern technology has enabled the country to attain food self-sufficiency since \n1999, when the rice production exceeded 2 million tons (t) for the first time.3 Despite food \nautarky  at  the  national  level,  food  shortages  occur  in  many  pockets  around  the  country, \nespecially  in  the  northern  uplands.  In  recent  years,  attention  has  turned  to  improving  the \noperation and maintenance of existing irrigation systems in the lowlands and developing small-\n                                                 \n1  The proposed Project is included in the 2002 ADB Country Strategy and Program for the Lao PDR. \n2  Water and related natural resources, such as forests and fisheries, are collectively referred to as water resources \nin this report. \n3  The technological package has mainly been developed and delivered by the Lao-International Rice Research \nInstitute Project. During this 12-year collaborative project,  total rice production increased by over 53% from 1.5 \nmillion tons (t) in 1990 to 2.3 million t in 2001. ", "2 \nscale  systems  in  the  uplands  to  encourage  crop  diversification.4  Upland  agricultural \ndevelopment has focused on the impact of agriculture on key watersheds and aimed to reduce \nshifting cultivation. Livestock development is also of major concern especially in NNRB\u2019s upland \nplateau  of  Xieng  Khouang  Province.  Generally,  central,  provincial,  and  district  agricultural \ninstitutions  have  weak  technical  capacity  and  inadequate  resources  to  support  outreach \nprograms. As a result, agriculture is beset by low productivity across all its subsectors. \n \n2.  Nam Ngum River Basin \n \n4.  NNRB covers a large area, about 16,906 km2, in north-central Lao PDR, including  \nVientiane. Geographically, the hydraulic boundary of the NNRB cuts across the administrative \nboundaries  of  Vientiane  Province,  Vientiane  Municipality,  Xieng  Khouang  Province, \nXaisomboun Special Zone, and the small southeastern tip of Louang Prabang Province. Annual \naverage rainfall is 1,400\u20133,000 millimeters. Most of the estimated rural population5 of 575,000 in \nthe basin has significant ethnic diversity and is highly mobile\u201460% move at least once a year. \nIncidence of poverty is high; about 40% of the population reports annual rice shortages for 4 \nmonths or longer. Over 65% of the population lives below the poverty line of $11.20 per capita \nper month.6 Despite the war in the 1960s and early 1970s and the development of the Nam \nNgum 1 (NN-1) hydropower project in 1971, the impact on forests, water quality, and erosion \nhas been minimal. However, the construction of the NN-1 dam has restricted the migration of \nfisheries downstream. Although the river basin is in transition, its main characteristics are stable. \n \n5.  NNRB is the most important river basin in the country for several reasons. It is the first \nlarge river basin where water resources were utilized significantly through inter-river and inter-\nwatershed diversions, reservoir management, hydropower generation, and irrigation. Several \nprospective hydropower projects have been identified in this river basin.7 As NNRB is close to \nthe capital, IWRM can be developed in close coordination with all the relevant stakeholders.  \n \n3.  Water Sector Planning \n6.  Water  is  the  most  vital  economic  input  to  agricultural  production  and  hydropower \ngeneration. Within the water sector, various development activities are being undertaken to \nreduce poverty, increase agricultural production, and raise foreign exchange earnings through \nhydropower  exports  to  Thailand.  This  development  strategy  is  expected  to  spur  equitable  \neconomic growth, particularly through regional development in the provinces. \n \n7.  The Government has made a steady progress in water sector and river basin planning \nsince the mid 1990s (Appendix 2). In 1997, recognizing the great development potential of \nNNRB for hydropower and agriculture, the Government carried out a study under an Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) to develop a management plan for the Nam \nNgum watershed.8 The study outlined and evaluated alternative hydropower and agricultural \ndevelopment  scenarios  and  recommended  investment  proposals  to  expand  development \nopportunities  and  enhance  environmental  mitigation  efforts.  The  Integrated  Watershed \nManagement Unit (IWMU) was set up in the Department of Planning, MAF. Supported until \nrecently under a Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) project for institutional \n                                                 \n4 BMB Management Consultants. 2000.

The Netherlands. \n5  This estimate does not include the population of Vientiane and its plains of about slightly over 1 million. \n6  The Government has set the consumption poverty line at 2,100 kilocalories per capita per day which is roughly \nequivalent to $11.20 per capita per month. \n7  TA 2734-LAO identified three potential hydropower projects in this river basin. \n8  ADB. 1996. Technical Assistance for Nam Ngum Watershed Management Plan. Manila. ", "  3 \nstrengthening, the unit is an important element in the planning of rural development projects at \nthe subwatershed level. After the Nam Ngum watershed study, the Government recognized the \nneed to apply IWRM holistically in the whole NNRB rather than just the upper watershed or its \nsubwatersheds. \n \n8.  Since  the  Government\u2019s  development  strategy  emphasizes  poverty  reduction  and \neconomic growth through improved management of water resources, IWRM is necessary to \nreinforce links and synergies between water and land use, the environment, and sustainable \ndevelopment. The Government has already taken steps to introduce this approach, helped by \nseveral ADB TAs after TA 2734-LAO. The Government has approved the Water and Water \nResources Law (the Water Law) and documented issues relevant to river basin planning and \nmanagement through consultations with the concerned stakeholders, and prepared the National \nWater Sector Profile (NWSP) and Water Sector Strategy and Action Plan (SAP). SAP, already \napproved by the Government, addresses cross-sectoral issues by emphasizing appropriate \npolicy,  community  education,  and  data  management.  As  a  first  step  to  build  capacity  to \nimplement  these  policies  and  plans,  the  Government  established  the  Water  Resources \nCoordination Committee (WRCC) in February 1998.9 \n \n9.  The Government has implemented the most important elements of SAP and the Water \nLaw by addressing nation-wide issues of policy development.10 The implementation of these \npolicies and plan has increased the WRCC\u2019s capacity. The Government also aims to strengthen \nthe institutional capacity of other relevant agencies to deal with social and environmental risks \nparticularly  for  the  energy  and  transport  sectors.11  To  implement  the  Water  Law,  a  prime \nministerial decree was approved in September 2001. \n \n10.  The WRCC has decided that each main tributary catchment of the Mekong River in the \nLao PDR, including the Nam Ngum watershed, will be classified as a river basin where planning \nuses  IWRM,  to  ensure  that  the  effects  of  development  on  downstream  areas  are  fully \nconsidered. For the Lao PDR, this is a new approach. In the past, planning was generally based \non an administrative boundary (i.e. district) rather than that of hydraulic (i.e., subwatershed) with \nlittle interagency coordination. For example, strategy and planning have been completed for the \nNam  Ngum  Watershed  (NNWS)  upstream  of  NN-1  dam.  Previous  planning  was  done  in \nisolation, either by the Ministry of Industry and Handicrafts (MIH) for hydropower generation or \nby MAF for watershed management. \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s investments in the water sector have accounted for 53% of TAs and 30% of loans \nto  the  Lao  PDR.  These  investments  have  mainly  been  allocated  to  three  subsectors: \nhydropower (71%), water supply (17%), and irrigation (12%). The Government also receives \nassistance for the water sector from the World Bank, Food and Agriculture Organization, United \nNations Development Programme and other agencies, including the Mekong River Commission. \nThe external assistance to water sector in NNRB is summarized in Appendix 3. \n \n12.  The Government has made a concerted effort in water sector reform since 1997 by (i) \ncarrying out a sector study and preparing NWSP, (ii) adopting the Water Law, (iii) establishing \nthe WRCC, (iv) implementing sector strategies and an action plan, (v) preparing the NNRB \nprofile, and (vi) approving the prime ministerial decree to implement the Water Law.

The  Government  has  decided  that  further  sector \nreforms will be implemented by adopting IWRM in important river basins, starting with NNRB. \nThe proposed Project will help continue water sector reform and implement an investment \nproject in NNRB by combining investments in physical and institutional infrastructure, using an \nintegrated approach and in consultation with the relevant stakeholders. The proposed Project is \nfully consistent with ADB\u2019s water policy.12 \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Integrated Water Resources Management and Institutional Coordination \n13.  The most important institutional problem in the water sector in the Lao PDR is the lack of \ncoordination between key sector agencies. Twelve water agencies (all members of WRCC) and \nanother 10 have a direct interest in water resources. Along with agriculture, hydropower has a \nsignificant stake in this sector. The MIH Department of Electricity determines policies, plans, \nlaws, and regulations to develop and manage the production and distribution of electricity. The \ndepartment reviews and evaluates power project proposals, contracts, and agreements. Other \nagencies such as transport, health, and education also deal with issues directly related to water.  \n \n14.  The  prime  ministerial  decree  defines  the  structure  of  water  resource  planning  and \nmanagement at two levels: national and river basin. At the national level, the WRCC is to act as \nan inter-agency coordinator for sustainable use of water resources based on IWRM13 and \nfacilitate the implementation of the Water Law and other resource legislation, such as the Land \nLaw and various pieces of planning legislation. SAP has established linkages between national \nsocio-economic goals and water resources, and identified the national objectives, strategies, \nand priorities for water resource management, including institutional issues. At the river basin \nlevel, the WRCC is to foster and support the development of river basin committees. The \nNNRBC was established in mid-2001 and comprises Vientiane Province, Vientiane Municipality, \nXieng Khouang Province, and Xaisomboun Special Zone.14 However, the incipient WRCC and \nNNRBC have not been able to play their roles as envisaged in their mandates due mainly to \nweak technical capacity and allocation of inadequate resources. \n \n15.  While the Government has adopted IWRM, a practical mechanism to implement it is not \nyet  in  place.  IWRM  is  applied  to  hydraulic  boundaries,  implying  that  the  water  resources \nmanagement unit would be a river basin\u2014an area of land draining to one point, i.e., the Nam \nNgum River\u2019s outlet to the Mekong River. IWRM is an important development since river basins \ncut across administrative boundaries. IWRM is also in line with the basic premise underlying the \nWater Law as well as its recent decentralization policy,15 representing an important opportunity \nto develop water resource management systems under the WRCC attuned to the Government\u2019s \nrequirements. In May 2002, MAF was entrusted with overall rural development rather than just \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2001. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n13 Like IWRM, river basin management seeks to improve the planning, conservation, development, and management \nof water, forest, land, and aquatic resources to equitably maximize economic benefits and social welfare without \ncompromising environmental sustainability. Typically, IWRM is undertaken in river basins because they or, in some \ncases, groundwater basins, form the natural unit to manage water resources. \n14The NNRBC was established with assistance from TA 3544-LAO. It has also helped prepare this Project by \nproviding significant stakeholder inputs and identifying potential activities and Project components, through formal \nworkshops and numerous community consultations.   \n15 The decentralization policy adopted in March 2000 (Instruction 01/PM 11/03/2000) aims to empower provincial and \ndistrict authorities to manage local financial and natural resources. Under this policy, provinces are strategic \nplanning unit; districts, planning and budgeting units; and villages, implementing units. ", "  5 \nagricultural development and can now implement the Water Law and other legislation related to \nrural development at the provincial and district levels. IWRM thus needs to be fostered at the \nnational level for interagency and at the decentralized level for interprovincial coordination. A \nstrengthened and fully functional WRCC would be a more effective coordinator.  \n \n2.  Hydropower Generation and Reservoir Management in River Basins \n16.  Hydropower generation is important to optimize water resources. The policy objectives \nof  hydropower  generation  and  expansion  relate  to  an  affordable,  reliable,  and  sustainable \nsupply and export of surplus power to meet development objectives. Given the quantity of water \nresources,  the  country\u2019s  huge  hydropower  potential  could  generate  considerable  export \nsurplus,16 but only if specific hydropower schemes are developed. The economic viability of \nthese projects depends on the export price of electricity for which the Lao PDR has some \ncomparative advantage. The proposed hydropower projects at varying stages of planning (11 of \nwhich are in NNRB)17 will have an enormous impact on the environment and people. Managing \nthe  effects  of  such  schemes  on  river  basins  will  require  effective  coordination  among  the \nconcerned  agencies  and  further  strengthening  of  their  technical  capacity.  Management  of \nreservoirs  will  be  essential  in  producing  low-cost  and  reliable  hydropower  while  ensuring \neffective flood mitigation and safeguarding water allocation rights of downstream users. \n \n17.  The largest reservoir in the country, NN-1 is not managed along these principles. The \nHydropower Office (HPO) of MIH, entrusted with the reservoir\u2019s operation and management, \nconsiders hydropower generation its foremost priority rather than optimizing NNRB's overall \nwater  resources.  Even  the  operation  of  NN-1  is  not  optimized  for  want  inflow  forecasting \nmechanisms and a well-calibrated river basin model. Due to lack of such decision-making tools, \nhydropower generation is not optimized. Besides, during the wet season, when other tributaries \nand  the  Mekong  River  itself  have  high  water  levels,  this  operational  regime  sometimes \naggravates floods. Conversely, during the dry season, water requirements of many schemes \nand communities downstream are not met as water is released from the reservoir only for \nhydropower generation. By establishing a holistic reservoir management regime, based on a \nriver basin model, many of these constraints can be overcome and/or their impact minimized. \n \n3.  Agricultural Development in Critical Watersheds \n18.  The Government\u2019s agricultural development strategy18 classifies agricultural areas into \ntwo main agronomic zones: (i) the sloping lands (including upland plateaus and valley floors) \nand (ii) the flatlands along the Mekong Corridor. Sloping lands include key watersheds (many \nare in NNRB) and forest cover, which are essential for the long-term sustainability of water \nresources in NNRB. Population per hectare of cultivable land in the upland areas is dense and \nincreasing in excess of 2.5%, reducing fallow periods for land under shifting cultivation from 14 \nyears to 5\u20137 years. Conflicts over water, especially in the dry season, have increased in some \nareas. Many communities report rice shortages for 4 months or longer each year. Poverty is \nendemic; in many areas 30\u201350% households live below the poverty line. Poor rural folk, mostly \nethnic groups, often depend on livestock and forest products for cash. However, livestock is \nprone to high morbidity and mortality rates, and the timber and forest product industry is based \n                                                 \n16 In 2000, the domestic consumption of power was 554 gigawatt hours (GWh), leaving 653 GWh for export. The \nexported power was valued at $16.9 million\u2014about 7.5% of total exports. \n17 If all the proposed hydropower schemes were developed\u2014a highly unlikely prospect\u2014more than 80% of the \nagricultural land in NNRB would be inundated. However, even the development of the most probable next \nhydropower scheme in NNRB, Nam Ngum 3, is only a remote possibility. \n18 As outlined in the Master Plan Study on Integrated Agricultural Development in Lao PDR: Profiles for Priority \nProjects and Programs. Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, October 2001. ", "6 \non  exploiting  the  resource  base  rather  than  managing  it  in  a  sustainable  manner.  These \nlivelihood systems are a threat to NNRB watersheds and water supply. In the flatlands of NNRB, \neffective use of water has been a prime concern in the irrigated areas. Overirrigation leads to \nsalinization while the increased adoption of HYVs of rice and other cash crops requires a higher \nuse of fertilizers and other chemical inputs, which need careful management and monitoring to \nsafeguard water quality. In general, agriculture is constrained by an underresourced extension \nservice and poor access to technology by local communities, resulting in sub-optimal use of \nwater resources in NNRB. The problem-tree analysis is in Appendix 4. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n19.  Optimal use of water resources, especially in NNRB, is the long-term project goal. Two \nimmediate  project  objectives  are  to  (i)  foster  and  institutionalize  IWRM  in  the  mainstream \nplanning  process  of  the  Government  at  the  central  and  provincial  levels,  and  (ii)  support \ninvestment interventions in relatively degraded parts of NNRB to provide sustainable livelihood \nopportunities for poor and ethnic communities. NNRB was selected as the first to initiate these \nactivities due to its vital existing and planned water sector investments as well as its proximity to \nVientiane. This Project is the culmination of continuing efforts of the Government and ADB over \nthe last several years to establish and strengthen water sector institutions for their closer and \nmore effective coordination. The design of this Project will afford the first opportunity to central \nand provincial departments to implement IWRM through hands-on, closely interlinked activities. \nThe project framework is in Appendix 5. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n20.  To meet its objectives, the Project has three main components: (i) IWRM, (ii) reservoir \nmanagement  and  river  basin  modeling,  and  (iii)  watershed  management.  The  first  will \nstrengthen the capacity of the WRCC to coordinate efforts at the central level and, through the \nNNRBC, at provincial, level. The second component will help HPO devise a more effective \nmanagement regime for the NN-1 reservoir to optimize power generation, mitigate floods, and \nimprove water-use efficiency in NNRB. The third component will (i) strengthen the capacity of \nthe IWMU of MAF and its other relevant provincial and district departments, (ii) increase crop \nproductivity and irrigation efficiency, (iii) improve livestock and fishery management, and (i) \npreserve and restore forest resources. Watershed management activities selected through an \nintegrated water resources planning process at the village, district, and provincial levels\u2014a \nconsultative process facilitated by the WRCC and NNRBC\u2014will further embed IWRM in all \ngovernment tiers.  \n \n21.  The activities of the first two components are focused, specific, and directly related to the \nfunctions of the WRCC and HPO, respectively. However, to implement the investment activities \nof the third component, the Project will have to adopt a sector lending approach. The activities \nof  the  watershed  management  component  illustrate  the  kinds  of  interventions  that  will  be \nundertaken  during  project  implementation.  These  activities  were  selected  from  examples \npresented to the WRCC by the provincial planning departments represented on the NNRBC, \nand from participatory rural assessments (PRAs) conducted in local communities, and are \nfocused on the poor upland areas of NNRB. PRAs highlighted the following high-priority needs \nof local communities: (i) set up revolving funds; (ii) provide rural water supply schemes; (iii) build \nrural access pathways; and (iv) organize and train people to improve their livelihood. Since \nthese are relatively high-risk activities and cannot be financed under the Project, a Japan Fund \nfor Poverty Reduction (JFPR) project is being prepared for parallel implementation with this ", "  7 \nProject. The JFPR project will provide grant financing for economic and social investments to \nimprove sustainable livelihood opportunities for the poor, especially ethnic women, based on \ntheir noted priorities. Direct synergies exist between the activities proposed under the JFPR \nproject  and  this  Project.  JFPR  project  activities  are  expected  to  make  the  participating \ncommunities more receptive to the Project and better prepared to benefit from it. Once JFPR \nactivities are determined to be sustainable, they will be replicated under the Project.  \n \n22.  Given  the  nature  of  activities  in  the  watershed  management  component,  only \nrepresentative  core  subprojects  (subwatersheds)  were  identified  to  prepare  full  feasibility \nstudies.19  During  project  implementation,  the  same  activities  can  be  expanded  to  more \nsubprojects by replicating the same approach. Other subprojects can be identified based on the \nselection criteria agreed on with the Government. The main elements of the selection criteria \nare that (i) the subprojects should encompass a micro- or a subwatershed boundary, (ii) at least \n25% of the population in each subproject district is below the poverty line, (iii) a subproject with \na  larger  degraded  land  area  is  preferred,  (iv)  ethnic  groups  and  women  will  have  equal \nopportunity to participate in the Project, and (v) an initial environmental examination of the \nproposed subproject will be undertaken to ensure that the proposed project activities will not \nhave any detrimental impact on the environment. \n \n23.  Five core subprojects (subwatersheds) selected to initiate the investment activities of the \nwatershed management component include Nam Toum-Kha-Piang, Nam Xan, Nam Muay, Nam \nPha-Yen, and Nam Chia-Hao, covering 90 villages or 5,811 households with an estimated total \npopulation of 38,658. Total cultivated area is 4,520 hectares (ha) (or, 2% of the total cultivated \narea of NNRB), of which 3,000 ha (66%) is lowland rain-fed rice. Supplementary wet-season \nirrigation supports only a small rice area of about 250 ha. The remaining area (about 1,270 ha) \nis upland mix of cash crops, vegetables, and fruit trees. Shifting cultivation is practiced on \nanother about 31,200 ha. \n \n24.  Description of the Project area, development strategy, and subproject selection criteria \nare in Appendix 6. The Project\u2019s development approach is consistent with the Government\u2019s 20-\nYear Plan; Five-Year Socioeconomic Development Plan, 2001\u20132005; and Public Investment \nProgram.20 The project\u2019s sector lending modality, in terms of area and time slice, supports the \nGovernment\u2019s development and public investment plans as laid out in the last two documents. \n \n1.  Integrated Water Resources Management \n25.  If WRCC is to be a viable coordinating agency for water sector management, then it \nmust have a clear action plan based on its mandate and priority IWRM functions, as well as \ncontinued support aimed at strengthening its role and capacity. The WRCC's Mandate indicates \nthat it is to study, monitor, coordinate, and advise in a number of important water-related areas \nsuch  as  policy  and  legislation  development,  information  management,  water  resources \nplanning, human resource development, and public awareness. It should have the capacity to \nmonitor and evaluate IWRM activities and to guide other water management agencies towards \n                                                 \n19 In this Project, subproject and subwatershed are synonymous. The subproject will always encompass a hydraulic \nboundary of either a micro- or a subwatershed, depending on the land slope. \n20 The 20-Year Plan is the Government\u2019s exit strategy from the status of least-developed country by 2020. The goal of \nthis plan is being pursued through eight national socio-economic priority programs. The Five-Year Plan is the \nplanning cornerstone and translates the policies of the Party Congress into targets and objectives for sectors and \nregions. These targets reflect the eight priority national programs, with poverty reduction and food self-sufficiency \ntopping the list. The Public Investment Program is a component of the Five-Year Plan and it lists the investment \nprojects contained in various sector programs.  ", "8 \na more holistic approach to water management. This component will incorporate the following \nactivities:  (i)  development  of  an  updated  WRCC  Action  Plan  and  development  and \nimplementation  of  a  WRCC  capacity  building  plan;  (ii)  policy  and  legislation  development \n(including  regulations  and  guidelines  for  addressing  key  water  management  issues  and \nimplementing river basin plans); (iii) data and information management (including development \nof a coordinated national water resources data management and sharing system); (iv) water \nresources planning coordination (including a coordinated planning approach involving HPO and \nIWMU and consultation with stakeholders); (v) training (including training needs assessment, \nplanning, coordination and evaluation for IWRM across the Project components); and  (vi) public \nawareness and consultation (including development and implementation of a public awareness \nstrategy).  Achievement of these objectives and development of the related capacity in WRCCS \nwill help ensure that the WRCC is seen as a valuable, effective, and sustainable water sector \ncoordinating agency at both the central as well as the river basin level. \n \n2.  Reservoir Management and River Basin Modeling \n26.  This component will strengthen the capacity of HPO, and other relevant agencies, to  \noptimize water resources in NNRB in general and the improve management of NN-1 reservoir in \nparticular. A review of current operations of NN-1 will consider two aspects: (i) long term \noperational  planning  for  hydropower  generation,  based  on  optimized  sharing  of  the  water \nresources for various uses, given improved knowledge of expected inflows; and (ii) short term \noperational planning in the wet season to reduce downstream flood damages, given improved \ninflow forecasting and increased knowledge of downstream conditions. The expected output of \nthis component will include: (i) ability of relevant agencies to adopt planning tools to define the \nfuture  operation  of  the  NN-1  reservoir  under  actual  hydrological  conditions;  (ii)  increased \nknowledge of various stakeholders in NNRB on available water resources, their optimum use \nand the economic benefits; (iii) increased readiness for flood mitigation in downstream areas of \nNNRB, and (iv) tools to negotiate and allocate bulk water shares for different users under the \nWater Law. It is expected that this component will change the operation of NN-1 reservoir from \nmainly hydropower generating scheme to an integrated utility that will carry out improved flood \nmitigation and better maintenance of downstream riverine ecosystem. \n   \n27.  This component will develop: (i) a Nam Ngum River basin model for long- and short term \noperational planning flexible enough to quantify impacts of large-scale changes in watershed \nland use, significant irrigation developments, and implementation of other hydropower schemes \nin NNRB; (ii) a geographical information system based on hydrodynamic model of the Vientiane \nPlain to understand relationship between flows in Nam Ngum River and the water level in the \nMekong River; and (iii) an economic model to estimate benefits of IWRM and the impact of \nexpected changes in the operation of NN-1 reservoir. \n \n3.  Watershed Management  \n28.  The outputs of this component can be divided into two broad categories. One output will \nstrengthen the capacity of the IWMU. The other, which entails the most extensive investment \nactivities  of  the  Project,  will  provide  effective  agricultural  extension  support  to  upland \ncommunities.  At  the  national  level,  the  extension  activities  will  be  planned  by  the  newly \nreorganized MAF department, National Agricultural and Forestry Extension Service (NAFES).21 \n                                                 \n21 Under the old set-up, individual departments of MAF\u2014irrigation, agriculture, livestock and fisheries, and forestry \nhad their own extension units. This fractured set-up was inefficient and could not take advantage of economies of \nscale. All the departments\u2019 human and material resources have now been pooled under NAFES. For farming \ncommunities, it will be a one-stop-shop for all types of agricultural extension services.  ", "  9 \nIn  the  field,  the  implementation  of  extension  activities  will  take  place  through  Provincial \nAgricultural and Forestry Services (PAFSs) and the District Agricultural and Forestry Offices \n(DAFOs). By reorganizing its agricultural extension delivery system through NAFES in August \n2001, the Government recognizes that under-resourced and ineffective extension service was \nthe weak link in efforts to promote rural development while ensuring sustainable watershed \nmanagement. Historically, the average budgetary allocation of about 95:5 for hardware and \nsoftware activities, was skewed in favor of infrastructure development, i.e., construction of \noffices  and  irrigation  schemes.  The  main  thrust  of  this  component  is  to  support  the  new \ngovernment policy, which emphasizes improving delivery of appropriate agricultural technology \nto local communities.  \n \n29.  The design of this component has benefited from lessons learned under numerous \nsimilar projects in the country. From the extension efforts of the United States Agency for \nInternational Development in the 1960s and 1970s to the Pilot Extension Project\u2019s activities in \nthe  1990s,  the  main  lessons  learned  are  (i)  adoption  will  be  slow  and  modest;  (ii)  new \ntechniques must blend in with cultural, environmental, farm, and market realities; and (iii) regular \ncommunity-based training in the local language with hands-on demonstration is necessary to \nshow results. Although results from many irrigation project areas22 are encouraging but the \nbeneficiaries there enjoy better input/output markets and access to improved infrastructure. \nTherefore,  under  this  Project,  only  modest  targets  have  been  set  for  the  upper  basin \nsubprojects. The Lao-International Rice Research Institute (Lao-IRRI) has nine high yielding \nvarieties (HYVs) suited to these areas and which do not require chemical fertilizes and/or \npesticides. The target farmers will raise their rice yields to meet food shortages rather than \nproduce  rice  for  the  market.  Given  Lao-IRRI\u2019s  appropriate  technology  package,  modest \nexpected yield improvements (0.5 t/ha), chronic food shortages, and intensive training in local \nlanguages, the extension activities under the Project will most likely succeed. \n \n30.  Capacity Building in the IWMU. The IWMU helps MAF manage watersheds and plan \nrural  development  by  subwatershed.  The  activity  will  build  on  the  experiences  and \nachievements of Phase-1 financed by DANIDA,23 with an emphasis on IWRM. Under phase-1, \nan integrated planning approach to watershed management is being developed in consultation \nwith  pilot  provinces  and  districts  with  field-test  activities  undertaken  in  Feuang  District  of \nVientiane Province. The bottom-up approach is also being tried out in eight villages in two \ndistricts of Xieng Khouang and Hua Phan provinces and in the Nam Et Phou Loi National \nBiodiversity Conservation Area Project. The aim of this activity strongly supports IWRM similar \nto that of the WRCC.  \n \n31.  The  IWMU  is  still  evolving  in  function  and  capacity.  Its  constraints  included  (i) \nunderdeveloped operational guidelines, (ii) inadequately trained human resources, (iii) weak \ninter-agency collaboration for natural resources planning, (iv) ineffective system of management \nand data sharing, (v) little integration of environmental concerns in sector planning, and (vi) \nweak provincial- and district-level capacity that hampered the preparation of good-quality local \ndevelopment plans and activities. The expected outputs of this activity will include (i) training of a \ncore staff at the central level capable of helping the WRCC draft a framework approach to \nIWRM in rural development, (ii) preparation and adoption of 16 watershed plans in NNBC, and \n(iii) establishment of an integrated natural resource information system. \n                                                 \n22 Loan 1488-LAO: Community-Managed Irrigation Sector Project, for $15.0 million, approved in 1997, has supported \n44 schemes in five provinces. Rice productivity has, on average increased, from 2.0 t/ha to 3.5 t/ha.   \n23 DANIDA  was originally supportive of phase 2 until the agency\u2019s overall policy to projects in Laos was revised in \n2002 following a change of government in Denmark. ", "10 \n \n32.  Integrated Agricultural Extension. Of the Government\u2019s agricultural system services, \nextension is the weakest. Over the last 10 years, a number of projects have prepared and \ndelivered  appropriate  agricultural  technology  packages.  Lao-IRRI  has  helped  the  country \nachieve rice self-sufficiency. The forage technology developed by the International Center for \nTropical Agriculture can be effective in raising livestock productivity. Appropriate technological \npackages for fruit tree and vegetable production, animal health, village forestry, and nontimber \nforest products (NTFP) are available and can be delivered to farming communities, along with \nappropriate training, to considerably raise their productivity and incomes. However, agricultural \nextension  service  significantly  lacks  human  resources,  technical  material,  and  delivery \nmechanisms.  The  project  activities  of  agricultural  extension  will  help  NAFES,  PAFSs,  and \nDAFOs serve the target villages and communities in selected subprojects. The service package \nwill be prepared based on target villages\u2019 needs and the water resource environment. For \ninstance, some villages may need assistance to improve crops and livestock but not fisheries \nand forestry, while others may need help with village forestry and/or NTFP and livestock. \nTherefore, extension activities should be flexible to serve local communities based on the nature \nof their livelihood systems.  \n \n33.  Crop Productivity Improvement. Agriculture consumes more water than any other \nsector in the economy. The sector is highly dependent on access to and supply of water. Water \nis critical for irrigated agriculture and for diversification of non-rice cash crops in the dry season. \nWater management for agriculture, therefore, is of critical importance not only for day-to-day \ncrop production but also for farming systems, livelihood strategies, and poverty reduction. \n \n34.  In NNRB in general and its uplands in particular, crop productivity is low due to farmers\u2019 \nlack of access to (i) appropriate training; and (ii) timely and adequate basic inputs, i.e., fertilizers \nand HYV seeds. Improved productivity, especially of rice, will (i) reduce poverty, as most upland \nhouseholds face rice shortages for 3\u20134 months a year; (ii) release labor and land for other \nincome-generating  activities;  and  (iii)  minimize  environmental  impact  by  containing  shifting \ncultivation and forest encroachment. The main thrust of this extension effort will be in wet- \nseason rice areas where the current rice yield of 1.5 t/ha can be increased to 2.0 t/ha. Upland \nareas can also diversify into vegetable production. The development of orchards on sloping \nlands will stabilize soil and also reduce shifting cultivation. The long-term goal is to convert \nupland shifting rice cultivation into orchards (mango, tamarind, citrus, and banana).Vegetables, \nincluding cabbage, beans, and garlic, can be grown on the lower slopes. \n \n35.  Livestock and Fishery Improvement. Livestock is central to the livelihood security of \nresource-poor farmers in the upland areas, where most poor ethnic groups live. Several PRAs \nunder  this  as  well  as  other  projects  have  repeatedly  demonstrated  that  livestock  is \nindispensable as a rural social safety net.24 The livestock subsector is beset by high morbidity \nand mortality rates, 40\u201350% or higher, and lack of access to appropriate forage technology. The \nProject will provide (i) extension service to manage cattle, buffalo, and small livestock (pigs and \npoultry);  (ii)  farmer-based  disease  control  and  vaccination  programs;  (iii)  a  village-based \nextension program emphasizing training of female livestock farmers; and (iv) better linkages \nwith the market. Improved livestock feed will be ensured by introducing appropriate forage and \nother  feed  technologies  coupled  with  managed  rather  than  the  more  common  free-range \ngrazing. The Project will also help (i) establish subwatershed livestock management committees \nby building on existing rural institutions but ensuring that hitherto excluded groups (women and \nethnic groups) participate, (ii) initiate pilot programs in schools to develop greater awareness of \n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2001.

", "  11 \nwatershed management issues, and (iii) send study tours of extension workers and community \nleaders to other subwatersheds in the NNRB and elsewhere in the country. \n \n36.  Fish is an important source of protein for rural households throughout the country. \nHowever,  fish  farming  beyond  subsistence  requires  a  good  transportation  system,  a  well-\ndeveloped market, and cold-storage facilities. Since these are not available, the Project will not \nattempt to generate a large surplus of farmed fish. Instead, the Project will help realize a modest \nincrease in fish farming to improve nutrition through community-based extension activities. \nCollaborating with and building upon the experience of FAO-UNDP\u2019s Provincial Aquaculture \nDevelopment  Project,  the  Project  will  continue  decentralizing  hatcheries,  extending  fish \ntechnology  to  the  villages,  and  helping  form  and  train  fish  farmers\u2019  groups  in  existing \ncommunity-based management groups (e.g., water users associations). \n \n37.  Forest  Restoration  and  Sustainable  Land  Use.  Forests  are  an  integral  part  of \nlivelihoods  of  local  communities  and  the  rural  poor,  a  major  source  of  revenue  for  the \ngovernment, and play an important role in maintaining land productivity and regulating water \nyields in NNRB. Forests provide for important subsistence needs of fuelwood and timber for the \nrural households, and NTFPs contribute up to 50-60% of the rural household income. NTFPs \nare a critical resource for the rural poor for meeting their food security needs, and act as a \nsafety net during natural or economic crises. It is estimated that NTFP exports, mainly to PRC, \nThailand, and Vietnam generate over $6 million a year; or about 2% of total national exports. To \nmeet the demands of an increasing and relatively more prosperous population, increasing the \nsupply of fuelwood, timber, and NTFPs is essential for protecting the watershed. To achieve \nthese  objectives,  the  Project  will  undertake:  (i)  preparation  of  NNRB  forest  resource \ndevelopment strategy, (ii) rehabilitate and restore 9,000 ha of natural forests with less than 40% \ncrown density, and (iii) build capacity of extension workers, communities and beneficiaries for \nsustainable forest use and management.  \n \n38.  Current forest classification is neither based on sound forestry principles nor transparent \npractices.  This  results  in  inappropriate  allocation  of  capital  and  labor  resources  and \nunsustainable  forest  utilization.  The  Project  will  upgrade  the  forest  land-use  classification \nmethodology and information base for the NNRB, and prepare a 5 to15 year NNRB forest \nresource development strategy and management plans. The strategy will aim at optimizing \nwater  yields,  improving  livelihood,  and  ensuring  food  security  for  the  upland  communities. \nForest management plans for selected watersheds will: (i) delineate management units and \nprescribe  forest  restoration  and  production  areas,  (ii)  identify  silvicultural  and  sustainable \nmanagement regimes for timber and NTFPs, (iii) identify harvesting technologies and marketing \nstrategies, and (iv) identify appropriate institutional arrangements. \n \n39.  The Project will use framework species technology for restoring 3,500 ha of degraded \nnatural forest area with crown cover ranging between 20-40%. Using agroforestry technologies, \nthe Project will improve forest condition and production of timber and NTFPs over 5,500 ha of \nstate and commune forest lands. Individual and/or groups of households will be involved in this \nactivity.25 Moreover, both modern and indigenous technologies will be used in implementing this \ncomponent.  Project  will  strengthen  and  upgrade  forest  resource  planning,  restoration,  and \nmanagement  capacities  of  the  concerned  line  agencies;  Project  area  communities;  and \n                                                 \n25 Framework species approach economies on time and material inputs by using a selected and critical number of \noriginal and/or indigenous tree species as building blocks for accelerating forest recovery and regeneration. Agro-\nforestry involves growing of trees and agricultural crops on the same unit of land, at the same time or in sequence, \nwith the dual purpose of establishing a permanent tree cover, and improving local farming systems for increased \nfood and subsistence security. ", "12 \nparticipating  beneficiaries.  Capacity  building  activities  will  include:  (i)  on-hands  training  in \nparticipatory forest resource management planning, (ii) nursery technology and management, \n(iii)  forest  rehabilitation  and  restoration  technologies,  (iv)  sustainable  timber  and  NTFP \nharvesting, (v) and marketing. These activities will benefit over 6,000 households, restore over \n9,000 ha of degraded natural forests, and generate over 1.65 million labor days of employment. \n \n40.  The proposed interventions have a good potential to succeed in the uplands especially \nin degraded parts of the subwatersheds. The World Conservation Union\u2019s NTFP pilot project, \nSupporting  the  Sustainable  Use  of  Non-Timber  Forest  Products,  in  1995\u20132000  was \nimplemented in conjunction with the National Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute in 12 \nvillages of Oudamxai, Champassak, and Salavan provinces. The project demonstrated that \nNTFPs have a great potential to: (i) reduce poverty by raising food security; (ii) ensure gender \nand  social  equity;  (iii)  conserve  forests,  biodiversity,  and  watersheds;  and  (iv)  develop \nsustainable forest-based commerce and industry.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n1.  Poverty, Ethnicity, and Gender in the Nam Ngum River Basin \n41.  The Government considers a person as poor who does not have access to 2,100 \nkilocalories per day, which is roughly the equivalent of an income of $11.20 per capita per \nmonth. This is much lower than the World Bank\u2019s universal definition of poverty line\u2014$1 per day \nper capita. The rural poverty line is considered 15\u201330% lower than the urban poverty line. In \nNNRB, approximately 201,600 persons live in poverty. While the average poverty level in NNRB \nis 28.1%, which is lower than the national average of 39%, upland ethnic groups suffer much \ndeeper poverty. The Hmong and Yao are the poorest, followed by the Khmou and the Tai. The \nlowland Lao are the least likely to be poor. The highest poverty gap is found in Xaisomboun \nSpecial Zone followed by Xiang Khouang Province. Sex ratios are high in rural NNRB and \nwomen outnumber men by approximately 10%. Women also suffer from poverty in gender- \nspecific ways. Poverty for women means having a greater work burden, poorer health, lower \neducation levels, less food, and inadequate rest than men. Dependency ratios are high implying \nthat for poor ethnic households, large families are part of strategies to deal with poverty. Chronic \nfood shortages are common: rice shortages for 3\u20135 months were reported during PRAs and \ncase studies. The main causes of food shortages were reported as (i) reduced access to land \nfor upland agriculture, (ii) lack of forest resources, and (iii) inadequate income from NTFPs. \nLand and forest allocations were stated to be unfair to the poor. Ethnic groups face social \nexclusion in various forms, including language barriers faced by schoolchildren and adults, \nparticularly women. The lack of trust arises out of histories of antagonism. Ethnic groups mostly \npractice shifting cultivation, considered detrimental to the environment, which the Government \nseeks to discourage. Ethnic groups see the policy as disregard for their knowledge of production \nsystems unique to their environment.  \n \n42.  The Project will address the primary concerns of the poor, including food security, \nsustainability of livelihoods, and access to productive resources. Communities will be organized \ninto  groups  so  they  can  access  better  agricultural  technologies  through  appropriate  and \ninclusive training and extension services. Land and forest allocations will be carried out in full \nconsultation  with  poor  communities.  Mass  organizations  and  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs) will work with PAFSs and DAFO officials to organize community-based groups and \nimpart training and provide extension support. Summary poverty reduction and social strategy is \nin Appendix 7. ", "  13 \n2.  Ethnic Groups\u2019 Development Plan in the Nam Ngum River Basin \n43.  Over half the potential project beneficiaries belong to smaller ethnic groups. The Hmong \nare the largest group (65.5%), followed by the Khmou (31.4%), and the Yao (2.1%). The Hmong \nare also the poorest. Under the Project, an ethnic groups\u2019 development plan (EGDP) has been \nprepared to provide socially inclusive strategies ensuring that ethnic groups benefit equitably. \nThe Government has set up the Lao Front for National Construction (LFNC) to ensure that \nethnic  groups  fully  participate  in  national  social,  economic,  and  political  activities.  LFNC \nrepresentatives are present in all ethnic villages and will play a critical role in facilitating their \nparticipation in project activities. LFNC will be represented on the national project steering \ncommittee. MAF will recruit a full-time specialist with expertise in ethnicity issues who will \ncoordinate EGDP implementation. To solve problems of poverty and exclusion, EGDP activities \nwill include (i) training and sensitization of PAFS and DAFO staff, (ii) production of culturally \nappropriate training material in ethnic languages and (iii) organization of ethnic groups for \nparticipatory training, extension support, and benefit monitoring. \n \n3.  Gender Issues and Gender Action Plan \n44.  Women constitute most of the poor farmers in NNRB. Over 85% of women live and work \nin farming households, where they have greater responsibilities than men for production and \nreproductive work. Women spend longer hours (i) working in upland agriculture; (ii) collecting \nNTFP for processing, consumption, and sale; (iii) raising small livestock for consumption and for \ncash income; and (iv) manufacturing handicrafts for cash income. Women also perform the bulk \nof household work with the help of children particularly girls. Girls and women have limited \neducation opportunities. Women have little or no land rights, particularly among the ethnic \ncommunities, which are patriarchal. The Project has prepared a gender action plan that will \nprovide for the following  (i) the WRCC recruit women for a minimum of 30% of technical \npositions;  (ii)  WRCC,  HPO,  MAF,  PAF,  and  DAFO  staff  will  undergo  mandatory  gender \nsensitization training; (iii) at least 30% of DAFO extension staff will be women; (iv) women\u2019s \ngroups  will  be  organized  for  project  activities;  (iv)  at  least  50%  of  all  training  program \nparticipants will be women; (v) training programs will be designed to suit the needs of women \nfarmers; (vi) women will form 50% of project beneficiaries; (vii) women beneficiaries will receive \njoint/single  titles  to  land  and  forest  resources;  and  (viii)  women\u2019s  groups    will  undertake \nparticipatory  evaluation  of  training  and  extension  programs  in  association  with  mass \norganizations, NGOs, and DAFO staff. \n \n4.  Environmental Issues and Monitoring \n45.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) has determined that the Project will provide \nsustainable livelihood opportunities to local communities and lessen human pressure on critical \nwatersheds. The IEE also indicates that the environmental impacts arising from the Project\u2019s \nconstruction and operation activities will be minor and can be minimized to acceptable levels \nusing  mitigation  measures.  Therefore,  the  Project  has  been  classified  as  environmental \ncategory B. A sample IEE for a core subproject, Nam Toum-Kha-Piang in Xieng Khouang \nProvince,  was  undertaken  in  detail  (Appendix  8).  A  summary  IEE  for  the  whole  Project, \nincluding an environmental management plan (EMP), has also been prepared (Supplementary \nAppendix D). Project implementation guidelines require that a detailed IEE report be prepared \nfor  each  remaining  subproject  and  submitted  to  the  environmental  authorities  for  approval \nbefore initiating any project activities. \n ", "14 \n46.  To ensure that all applicable national and provincial environmental laws, regulations, \nstandards, and ADB environmental requirements are met during project implementation, an \nEMP has been prepared. It will be carried out by Office of the National Project Manager (ONPM) \nin coordination with all the Project Implementation Units (PIUs). The Government has assured \nthat the mitigation measures identified in IEEs will be incorporated into the design, construction, \nand operation of the Project. An environment unit, staffed by an environment officer and a \nrepresentative  from  the  Science,  Technology,  and  Environment  Agency  (STEA),  will  be \nestablished in the ONPM. Each PIU will also be staffed by one environment officer. The ONPM \nand PIUs will monitor mitigation measures and submit quarterly project progress reports and \nannual environmental monitoring reports to STEA and ADB.   \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n47.  The project cost, including contingencies, taxes, and duties, is estimated at $23 million \nequivalent, consisting of a foreign exchange cost of $9.4 million (41%) and local currency cost \nof $13.6 million (59%) equivalent. Detailed cost estimates are in Table A9.1, Appendix 9. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n48.  ADB will provide a loan of $15 million equivalent to finance 65% of the total project cost. \nThe Government will contribute $4.2 million equivalent (18%) in local currency and in-kind costs. \nAgence Francaise de Developpement (AFD) will provide $3.8 million (17%) equivalent as a \ngrant in parallel cofinancing. Detailed financing plans are in Tables A9.2 and A9.3, Appendix 9. \nThe JFPR project will provide about $2 million for its own activities in addition to the Project\u2019s \noverall financing. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n49.  MAF will be the Executing Agency for the Project. The ONPM, headed by a National \nProject Manager, has been established in MAF\u2019s Department of Planning. PIUs in WRCC, HPO, \nand NAFES, headed by their respective Project Coordinators, have also been established. \nWRCC, HPO, and NAFES will be the implementation agencies for their respective components. \nUnder  the  watershed  management  component,  NAFES,  PAFS,  and  DAFOs  will  be \nimplementation  agencies  for  their  respective  activities  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s \ndecentralization  policy.  The  project  imprest  account  will  be  established  at  the  ONPM  and \nsecond-generation imprest accounts will be established at PIUs and the provincial level. A \nproject steering committee (PSC), headed by the Vice Minister, MAF, and comprising one \nmember each, at the director general\u2019s level, from WRCC, MAF, MIH, Ministry of Finance \n(MOF), Committee for Planning and Cooperation (CPC), Lao Women\u2019s Union, and LFNC; and \nrepresentatives  of  NNRBC  will  be  established.  NNRBC  representatives  will  comprise  the \nrespective vice governors (or equivalent officials) of Vientiane Province, Vientiane Municipality, \nXieng Khouang Province, and Xaisomboun Special Zone. A project procurement committee will \nbe established, headed by the director general, Department of Planning, MAF, and comprising \none representative each from the WRCC, MIH, MOF, and CPC. Key positions of counterpart \nstaff and outline terms of reference of Government offices and committees are in Appendix 10. \n ", "  15 \n2.  Implementation Period \n50.  The implementation period will be 6 years (2003\u20132008). The first year will focus on \nestablishing the necessary management systems, including those for procurement, accounting, \ndisbursement, and Project Performance Management System (PPMS) at the ONPM at MAF \nand the WRCCS. The WRCC and HPO components will start right after loan effectiveness. \nOnce  these  systems  are  in  place,  the  technical  activities  of  the  watershed  management \ncomponent will build capacity in the central and provincial training units and rehabilitate selected \nDAFOs and then train their extension workers, who will then conduct on-farm trials and train \nfarming communities for the rest of the Project. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n3.  Procurement \n51.  Goods and services financed from the ADB loan will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Vehicles,  equipment,  civil  works,  and  materials  will  be \nprocured by international competitive bidding where the cost is valued at more than $500,000 \nequivalent, or by international shopping where the cost is valued from $100,000 to $500,000 \nequivalent.  Where  several  local  suppliers  can  offer  satisfactory  service  facilities,  vehicles, \nequipment, civil works, and materials valued at less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured \nunder  local  competitive  bidding  procedures,  or  through  direct  purchase.  Final  details  for \nprocurement will be determined during project implementation as appropriate. To commence \nthe Project on time, ADB has approved, at the Government\u2019s request, an advance action for \nprocurement\u2014AFD will consider the same. The Government has been advised that approval of \nsuch advance action does not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n52.  Consulting services are required for project management and a number of technical \ninputs.  About  239  person-months  of  international  and  413  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting services will be required to support project implementation and capacity building. The \nconsulting services will be recruited in two packages. ADB will finance one package of 137 \nperson-months  of  international  and  201  person-months  of  domestic  consultants.  An \ninternational firm, in association with a domestic firm, will be engaged to provide the required \nsupport as per ADB Guidelines for the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for engaging domestic consultants. AFD will finance, in parallel, another package of 102 \nperson-months  of  international  and  212  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services. \nConsultants for this package will be recruited as per AFD procedures. The amount of consulting \nservices identified under the Project is considered necessary in view of the Government\u2019s \nlimited human resource capacity and technical expertise at all levels. Specialists will be required \nto introduce new technology through the Project and build capacity of project staff. \n \n53.  Although AFD will finance a large portion of the consulting services, ADB will finance  \nthe position of the team leader and other key consultants. All consultants will be required to \nwork under the team leader following specific terms of reference for each individual consultant \nbased on a consolidated work plan. This arrangement will ensure unified coordination for the \nproject implementation. A similar arrangement under an ongoing ADB-AFD cofinanced Project \nis working out smoothly.26 Outline terms of reference and details of both consulting packages \nare in Appendix 11. \n                                                 \n26 ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance on Decentralized Irrigation Management and Development Sector Project. \nManila. ", "16 \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n54.  To expedite disbursements, MOF, under its new rules and regulations, will allow MAF to \nestablish  a  project  imprest  account  operated  by  the  ONPM.  Second-generation  imprest \naccounts will be established in each PIU. These accounts will be used to meet eligible project \nexpenditures incurred by ONPM, PIUs, and IAs. Each imprest account will be managed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001). The initial combined \ntotal amount in all imprest accounts will not exceed 6 months of estimated expenditures and not \nmore than 10% of the loan amount. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedures will be followed \nto reimburse expenditures and liquidate imprest accounts for payments below the ceiling of \n$50,000. The Government\u2019s attention is called to ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy, particularly the \nsection on fraud and corruption, as stated in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n55.  PIUs  will  provide  the  ONPM  with  concise  quarterly  reports  during  each  year  of \nimplementation,  describing  (i)  physical  and  financial  progress  against  agreed  targets,  (ii) \ndisbursement of counterpart funds at provincial and/or district levels, and (iii) summary of PPMS \nresults.  In  turn,  the  ONPM  will  submit  consolidated  quarterly  and  comprehensive  annual \nprogress reports to MAF for onward submission to the Government, ADB, and AFD. Within 3 \nmonths of project completion, the ONPM will prepare a project completion report in the standard \nADB format and submit it to the Government, ADB, and AFD. \n \n56.  The ONPM and PIUs will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify \nthe goods and services financed from loan proceeds, financing resources received, project \nexpenditures,  and  use  of  local  funds.  Accounts  will  be  established  and  maintained  in \naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles and following MOF guidelines and \nprocedures as amended from time to time. Consolidated project accounts and related financial \nstatements  will  be  compiled  by  the  ONPM  and  audited  annually  by  independent  external \nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  accounts,  audit  reports,  and  related  financial \nstatements will be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months after the end of the fiscal year to \nwhich they relate. \n \n7.  Project Monitoring and Evaluation \n57.  Project Performance Management will be undertaken for each component to ensure that \nProject resources are managed efficiently and benefits realized. The ONPM will develop a \ncomprehensive PPMS with assistance from project management consultants. The PPMS will \ninclude a participatory mechanism to involve beneficiaries in monitoring. The ONPM, assisted \nby the PIUs, will be responsible for carrying out PPMS activities, including the establishment of \nbenchmarks through initial baseline physical and socioeconomic surveys, data collection, and \nanalysis. The ONPM will submit a detailed PPMS implementation plan to prepare benchmark \ninformation for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence within 6 months of loan effectiveness. The ONPM \nwill provide annual PPMS reports to ADB and AFD throughout project implementation. \n \n58.  Before project activities start, eight staff of the ONPM and PIUs will attend an intensive \n6-week PPMS training course at the Rural Development Institute at Khon Kaen University, \nThailand.  The  course  covers  (i)  baseline  survey  design  and  management  of  agricultural \ndevelopment projects, (ii) principles and methods of data and statistical analysis, and (iv) report \npreparation using tables and graphs. ", "  17 \n8.  Project Review \n59.  During  project  implementation,  ADB  will  carry  out  annual  reviews  assessing  the  (i) \nimplementation arrangements and their effectiveness; (ii) capacity-building activities and training \nprograms in the WRCCS, HPO, NAFES, IWMU, PAFSs, and DAFOs; (iii) progress of technical \ninterventions at the village level; and (iv) acceptance of IWRM in the overall water resources \nmanagement system. A midterm review will be carried out in year 3. The review will take a \ncomprehensive stock of the Project implementation and determine whether it complies with the \noriginal design parameters and that intended benefits have begun to materialize. The midterm \nreview will also afford an opportunity to make any requisite refinements to the Project design. \n   \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n1.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n60.  At the national level, project benefits will arise from optimal use of water resources by \ninstitutionalizing  IWRM.  More  efficient  management  of  the  NN-1  reservoir  will  generate \nadditional hydropower, improve water conservation, and mitigate floods. Other benefits will stem \nfrom  the  efficient  use  of  water  in  agriculture  leading  to  increased  crop  productivity  and \nhousehold incomes. Adoption of improved land-use practices, in the upper basin, will maintain \nthe water quality in the long run. At the grassroots level, the watershed management component \nwill target poor upland areas, and major beneficiary groups will include ethnic groups and \nwomen.  Through  crop  improvement,  livestock  and  fishery  management,  and  restoration \nforestry, household incomes of the beneficiaries will increase significantly while maintaining \nsustainable  livelihood  systems  and  the  environment.  Provision  of  sustainable  livelihood \nopportunities will ensure that forest degradation and shifting cultivation are stabilized to optimize \nwater  conservation.  Since  this  is  a  sector-type  project,  the  exact  impact  and  number  of \nbeneficiaries cannot be determined at the outset. By project completion, an estimated 10,000 \nhouseholds in NNRB will have directly benefited from the Project of which more than 25% live \nbelow the poverty line. \n \n61.  The project benefits from investment interventions will flow from higher rice yields, lower \nmorbidity and mortality rates among livestock, better agroforestry, and sustainable harvesting of \nNTFPs. Improved rice yields and some crop diversification will encourage a reduction in shifting \ncultivation on the upland slopes, optimize water usage on valley floors, and allow for forest \nrestoration.  Restoration  forestry  ensures  sustainable  development,  and  thus  conserves \nbiodiversity. The main extension effort will focus on rain-fed rice production using the Lao-IRRI \npackage of improved seed, fertilizer application, and better farming practices. The package is \nexpected to be used on over 20,000 ha, producing an incremental 10,000 t of rice per season. \nNNRB  has  a  large  and  relatively  dense  animal  population,  especially  in  the  upper  basin. \nMorbidity and mortality rates in livestock are as high as 40\u201350% in many parts of NNRB. The \nproposed livestock intervention will significantly reduce health risks to livestock in the project \narea. By introducing better forage technology, weight value of average animal will increase by \n25%. On average, NTFPs provide 55% of household cash income. Restoration forestry will \nraise incomes of 6,000 target households. Provision of alternative livelihood opportunities will \nensure that forest degradation, on about 30,000 ha, is stabilized and shifting cultivation, on \nanother  25,000  ha,  is  reduced  so  that  land-use  patterns  optimize  water  conservation. \nEnvironmental benefits will arise from (i) less risk to the range lands in the upper basin as a \nresult of improved animal husbandry, (ii) more stable slopes introduced under sloping-land \nagricultural technology, and (iii) cash and non-cash benefits from restoration forestry. \n ", "18 \n62.  Efficient operation of the NN-1 reservoir will provide an additional 2% or 20 gigawatt \nhours  of  hydropower  (worth  $600,000)  per  year,  mitigate  floods,  and  improve  water \nconservation. Through crop improvement, livestock and fishery management, and restoration \nforestry household incomes will increase significantly while maintaining sustainable livelihood \nsystems  and  the  environment.  The  overall  annual  income  of  a  household  is  expected  to \nincrease by about 80%; from KN7,140,000 ($700) to KN12,954,000 ($1270). The non-cash \nincome is expected to increase from KN6,630,000 ($650) to KN9,537,000 ($935), an increase of \n34%, while the return per family day of labor would increase from KN5,000 ($0.49) per day to \nKN13,000 ($1.27) per day. It is expected that, on average, the annual cash income will increase \nby 5-6 fold; from KN510,000 ($50) to KN3,417,000 ($335). Benefits from timber, about $40 \nmillion, will mature in year 20\u2014providing an additional lump sum income of about $6,600 per \nhousehold. The estimated economic internal rate of return, for base case, is 24.7% indicating \nsound economic viability of the Project. Detailed methodology and results of financial and \neconomic analyses are in Appendix 12. \n2.  Project Risks \n63.  The WRCC, HPO, NAFES, and IWMU and its provincial and district departments are \nshort of human resources and receive inadequate budgetary allocations. Capacity building will \ndepend on finding these resources, especially for the WRCCS and HPO, where a significant \nincrease in qualified technical staff is proposed. The investment interventions in agriculture and \nforestry depend on the capability of the provincial and district staff. The Project will build some \naspects of the agencies\u2019 capacity, but the success and sustainability of the project interventions \nwill  depend  largely  on  the  overall  ability  and  willingness  of  the  Government  to  plan  and \nimplement the interventions in cooperation with local authorities and communities. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n64.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given specific assurances \nthat will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Counterpart Funds. All counterpart funds for project implementation will be \nprovided  on  time.  The  Government  will  make  timely  submissions  of  annual \nbudgetary  appropriation  requests  and  ensure  prompt  disbursement  of \nappropriated funds during each year of project implementation. \n(ii)  Counterpart Staff. The Government and ADB will review the effectiveness of the \nONPM\u2019s activities and those of PIUs in the WRCC, HPO, and NAFES 1 year \nafter loan effectiveness and, if required, adopt improvement measures. \n(iii)  Social Issues: To ensure gender equity, active participation of poor and ethnic \ncommunities,  and  balanced  social  development  in  the  project  areas,  the \nGovernment  has  agreed  to  a  number  of  specific  assurances.  For  poverty \nreduction, the Project will (a) include at least 25% or more of poor farmers and \nrural producers in all project areas among its beneficiaries as well as members of \nall producer/user groups to be formed under the Project, (b) use participatory \nvillage-based land and forest allocation for equitable and secure land allocation, \nand (c) adopt participatory poverty impact assessment and PPMS. For effective \nparticipation of ethnic groups, the Project will ensure that (a) all PAFSs and \nDAFOs will recruit at least 50% of extension and training staff from among all \nethnic groups, including 50% women; (b) all training and demonstrations in ethnic ", "19\n \n(iv)  community areas will be culturally compatible and suited to the particular needs \nof upland communities; and (c) ethnic groups will be organized into groups for all \nproject activities including participatory poverty impact assessment. To support \ngender equity in development, the Project will (a) carry out mandatory regular \ntraining  of  staff  of  participating  government  agencies  in  gender-responsive \ndevelopment; (b) recruit women for at least 30% of WRCCS technical positions, \nand support recruitment of women for all positions under the Project; (c) ensure \nthat at least 50% of all trainees in training programs are women; (d) ensure that \nwomen  constitute  at  least  30\u201350%  of  membership  of  producer  and/or  user \ngroups; and (e) ensure that PPMS is gender responsive. To support social \ndevelopment, the Project will (a) retain the services of an international social \ndevelopment expert, on a periodic basis, in the ONPM to support all activities \nrelated to ethnic group participation, and gender and development; and (b) recruit \na full-time domestic social development specialist for the ONPM to support all \nsocial development activities. \n(v)  Environmental  Issues.  To  ensure  that  EMP  is  implemented  and  monitored \nsatisfactorily, an environment unit within the ONPM, with a member from STEA, \nwill  be  established  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  An  IEE  and/or \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  for  each  candidate  subproject  will  be \nprepared,  in  accordance  with  the  Government  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental \nguidelines  and  standards,  and  submitted  to  the  environmental  authorities \nconcerned for submission to ADB for its approval before final selection of the \nsubproject.  \n(vi)  Project Performance Management System. The Government will ensure that \ndata on communities, collected while prioritizing targets, will serve as baseline \ninformation for PPMS during project implementation. Within 9 months of loan \neffectiveness,  ONPM,  with  support  of  project  management  consultants,  will \nestablish appropriate mechanisms and procedures for PPMS. \n(vii)  External  Auditors,  Annual  Auditing,  and  Financial  Statements.  External \nauditors will be engaged to audit project accounts. The annual audited accounts \nand financial statements, together with audit reports, in English, will be submitted \nto ADB within 9 months following the end of the Government\u2019s fiscal year. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n65.  Before loan effectiveness, the Government will have: (i) filled key administrative and \ntechnical positions in the ONPM and PIU at NAFES/IWMU, as specified in Appendix 10, and \nestablished  their  office  premises  appropriately;  and  (ii)  evaluated  bidding  proposals  for \nconsulting services under the ADB-package.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n66.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with ADB\u2019s Articles of Agreement \nand recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special \nDrawing Rights 11,341,000 to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Nam Ngum River \nBasin Development Sector Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge \nat the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of \n32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n21 October 2002 ", "20  Appendix 1 \nPROJECT PROCESSING CHRONOLOGY \n \n1.  In response to a request from the Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n(Lao PDR), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided technical assistance (TA) to prepare \nthe Project.1 The objective of the TA was to help the Government introduce integrated water \nresources management (IWRM) to the Nam Ngum River Basin by (i) preparing a river basin \nresource  assessment  and  action  agenda  in  consultation  with  stakeholders,  formulating  a \nmedium-term basin management strategy, and establishing a river basin organization; and (ii) \nformulating  a  water  resource  investment  project  with  components  that  focus  on  poverty \nreduction, environmental management, and institutional development. \n \n2.  The consultant was mobilized in May 2001. During TA implementation, the TA review \nmission in November 2001 approached the Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD) and \ninvited them to become a partner in the Project especially to assist with the IWRM component. \nAFD considered the request and enlisted the Project in the AFD grant pipeline for 2003. A joint \nAFD-ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Lao PDR from 22 May to 3 June 2002.2 The Mission \nparticipated in the tripartite meeting to discuss the project design as presented in the draft final \nreport submitted on 30 April 2002. The Mission and Government agreed on the overall design of \nthe Project but the consultant was instructed to present its components in a coherent framework \nand also work out more detailed implementation arrangements. This project proposal is, in part, \nbased on the final report submitted in September 2002. \n \n3.  Based on the guidance received from the management review meeting, held on 18 July \n2002, the Loan Appraisal Mission was fielded from 25 July to 8 August 2002 to finalize the \ndesign and implementation arrangements of the Project.3 The staff review committee meeting \nheld on 3 September 2002 (i) confirmed that all relevant interdepartmental comments received \nhad been incorporated into the project documents, (ii) endorsed the project design, and (iii) \ndetermined there was no need for second management review meeting.  \n \n4.  The Appraisal Mission had determined that the consultant did not prepare the detailed \ncomponent costs and financing plan in close consultation with the three line agencies involved \nin the Project. A follow-up appraisal mission was fielded from 5\u201312 September 2002 to finalize \nthe component costs and financing plan.4 \n \n                                                 \n1    ADB. 2000.

Importance and Description of the Project Area  \n \n1.  Nam Ngum is one of the most important river basins in the country because it (i) is home \nto over 30% of the country\u2019s 5 million people; (ii) contributes over 10% of the country\u2019s total \nwater flow into the Mekong River; (iii) accounts for 34% of total dry-season rice production; (iv) \nsupports the largest reservoir and oldest hydropower scheme (150 megawatts) in the country\u2014\nthe  Nam  Ngum  1  (NN-1)  reservoir;  (v)  has  received  the  country\u2019s  largest  water  sector \ninvestments for interriver and interwatershed diversions, irrigation, and water supply schemes; \n(vi) is home to some of the country\u2019s poorest communities, mainly ethnic groups in the upper \nbasin; and (vii) is closer to the capital, Vientiane. In the recent years, the Ministry of Agriculture \nand Forestry (MAF) has adopted an integrated approach to natural resource management in the \nNam  Ngum  River  Basin  (NNRB).  This  Project  is  part  of  the  ministry\u2019s  natural  resource \nmanagement and rural development plan. The Ministry of Industry and Handicraft has also \nidentified prospective hydropower schemes in this river basin for likely investments.  \n \n2.  NNRB is in the north-central part of the country and covers 16,906 square kilometers \n(km2), including the 8,297 km2 Nam Ngum watershed (Map). NNRB extends northeast from the \nVientiane waterfront about 400 km to Xieng Khouang Province and makes up 2.73% of the \nentire lower Mekong basin. NNRB may be divided into three distinct areas, each with its unique \nconditions and characteristics: source, storage, and sink: \n \n(i)  Source. The upper basin or Nam Ngum watershed is above the NN-1 reservoir, with \nthe  western  boundary  running  along  the  Nam  Song  River  to  the  north  toward \nPhoukhoun town. The upper basin is the main catchment for the NN-1 reservoir. The \nland is mainly steep and sloping, except on the Plain of Jars. The upper basin \nconsists  of  parts  of  Xieng  Khouang  and  Vientiane  provinces  and  Xaisomboun \nSpecial Zone. During the Indochina conflict (1965\u20131975), the upper basin, along with \nsome other parts of the country, endured the heaviest bombardment in the history of \nmodern warfare. It resulted in considerable displacement and loss of human life and \nsignificantly damage the watershed. However, natural regeneration has helped the \nwatershed recover. Unexploded ordinance is still a major hazard around the poor \nvillages, killing or maiming scores of people every year. \n \n(ii) Storage. Commissioned in 1971, the NN-1 reservoir is the largest artificial lake in the \nregion spread over an area of about 450 km2, storing 7,010 million cubic meters (m3) \nof water at full supply level at 212 meters mean sea level. At minimum operating \nlevel of 196 meters mean sea level, it holds 2,501 million m3 of water. The lake\u2019s \nannual inflow from the Nam Ngum River exceeds 300 cubic meters per second \n(m3/sec). An additional mean flow of 59 m3/sec is supplied by an interriver diversion \nfrom the Nam Song River at the northern tip of NN-1 reservoir, and another mean \nflow of 39 m3/sec by an interwatershed transfer from the Nam Leuk River at the \neastern tip of NN-1 reservoir. Surface water quality in general is good. An estimated \n40 species of fish are found in the reservoir but only 12 are caught for trade. By a \nconservative estimate, the total annual value of reservoir fishing yield is over $1 \nmillion. Minimum annual fishing yield is estimated to be 32.6 kilograms (kg) per \nhectare (ha) at full supply level.  \n ", "28  Appendix 6 \n(iii) Sink. The lower basin consists of the flat land of the Vientiane Plain below the Nam \nLik\u2013Nam Ngum river junction and down to the confluence of the Nam Ngum River \nwith Mekong River near Pak-Ngum town. During the wet season, Nam Ngum River\u2019s \nflow into the Mekong River exceeds 700 m3/sec. The lower basin consists of parts of \nVientiane Province and Vientiane Municipality.   \n \n3.  The lower basin is a continuation of the Isarn Plateau (northern Thailand). The lower \nbasin is bisected by the Mekong River, which cuts off the Vientiane Plain from the rest of the \nplateau. However, the original ecology is the same\u2014mostly flat land, with mixed lateritic and \nshale-based soils, with generally saline groundwater. Although its soils are not naturally high in \nnutrients, the area is a much more productive than the upper basin. \n \n4.  Rainfall ranges from 1,400 millimeters (mm) in the upper basin to 2,800 mm near Vang \nVieng town, in the Nam Lik subwatershed in the lower basin. For 7 months, May-November, the \nupper  basin  has  abundant  water.  However,  during  the  other  5  months,  December-April, \ndegraded upstream subwatersheds dry out and smaller streams cease to flow. Dry-season \nflows in the mainstream above NN-1 may have been reduced because of deforestation, ever \nincreasing pressure from shifting cultivation and unsustainable harvesting of nontimber forest \nproducts  (NTFPs),  and  free  grazing  of  the  sizeable  livestock  population.  These  factors \ncombined may have caused some deforestation and loss of soil structure resulting in reduced \ninfiltration and recharging. \n \n5.  Most of the 575,000 rural population in the basin have a high ethnic diversity. Another 1 \nmillion people live in Vientiane City and its plains. Population density in the upper basin ranges \nfrom 30/km2 in Xieng Khouang (61%) to around 9/km2 in Xaisomboun Special Region (29%). A \ntotal of 239 villages have been recorded. While the population of the watershed is said to be \nhighly mobile, some well-established villages exist. At 2.3% per annum, the population growth \nrate is high and a population increase of 80% is expected by 2020.  \n \n6.  Widespread poverty is a major development challenge, particularly in the upper basin. \nAbout 65% of its total population or 200,000 people live below the poverty line of $11.20 per \ncapita  per  month.  Although  rice  shortages  are  reported  for  3-4  months  a  year  by  many \nhouseholds, poverty in NNRB is not synonymous with hunger\u2014NTFPs meet food shortfall. In \nthe  past,  abundant  natural  resources  provided  sustenance  for  poor  villagers,  but  these \nresources are now dwindling because of overexploitation as people search for food or sell forest \nproducts and NTFPs to pay for health services, education, and consumption.  \n \n7.  Outside Vientiane Municipality, over 90% households depend on agriculture. In NNRB \nrice productivity is low and farmers use limited inputs. Irrigation schemes are often poorly \ndesigned and executed, resulting in high water demand and low productivity. The upper basin \ncommunities live on subsistence farming and are locked in an acute poverty trap, created in part \nby (i) lack of regional market access, (ii) absence of appropriate technology and training, and \n(iii) lack of capital to fuel the transformation. In contrast, farmers are entering a period of \nagricultural  transformation  where  market  forces  are  starting  to  deliver  agricultural  inputs \ncommercially. In the wet season, nearly all flatlands are planted to rice. More land is coming \nunder irrigation in the dry season, producing a second crop of rice but also other crops such as \nmaize, vegetables, tobacco, and fruits. While cereal production elsewhere has increased rather \nslowly, the Vientiane Plain has seen higher production increases in recent years and the overall \ngrowth rate of agriculture has increased to around 5% a year from 2\u20133%. \n ", "Appendix 6  29 \n8.  Cattle, buffalo, pigs, and poultry are raised on farms. In the upland areas, the local \nyellow \u201cAsian\u201d breed of cattle is most common. Livestock is the single most important source of \nfamily  income,  which  could  be  substantially  improved  with  better  forage  and  health-care \ninterventions. Livestock management is severely constrained by disease, a generally low level \nof animal husbandry skills, and low-nutrient pasture. Fish is an important source of protein for \nmost rural households. Little is known about the ecology and recruitment of the more than 60 \nreported fish species, but important fisheries exist for the migrating cyprinids moving between \nthe reservoir and upper basin.  \n \n9.  The forest sector contributes about 7\u201310% to overall gross domestic product (GDP) and \n15\u201320% to nonagricultural GDP of the country. In 1997, forest area was estimated at about \n5,000 km2 or about 30% of NNRB and 2% of national forest cover. However, forest diversity has \nbeen notably reduced with a loss of mixed dense forest caused by selective logging. Wood and \nshrubland account for 40% of NNRB. The upper basin forest is highly fragmented while the  \n(Vientiane Plain) has little remaining forest cover. In the upper basin, forestry is one of the few \neconomic activities, and NTFPs provide more than 50% of household incomes. The extensively \nforested upper basin (especially Xaisomboun Special Region) has a comparative advantage in \nthese products as the forests of neighboring Thailand, People\u2019s Republic of China, and Viet \nNam  have  long  since  virtually  disappeared.  NTFP  and  niche  products  include  cardamom, \nbenzoin, paper mulberry, medicinal plants, wild herbs, wild orchids, bamboo shoots, and ferns. \nApart from substantially contributing to local food security and livelihood needs, and providing \nhabitat for a large variety of animal and plant species, these forests are indispensable in \nregulating hydrological flow of the basin and protecting downstream and lowland areas. \n \n10.  NNRB is inaccessible because of underdeveloped infrastructure. Secondary roads are \npoor  and  often  open  only  in  the  dry  season.  No  reliable,  all-weather  direct  lines  of \ncommunication link major cities. Various regional road links to Viet Nam and the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China are being constructed or improved, but much of the upper basin remains \ninaccessible by road, especially in the wet season. \n \n11.  The Indochina conflict (1965\u201375), increasing population pressure, shifting cultivation, \nand insufficient institutional capacity have exerted substantial pressure on the water resources \nof the upper basin. Unsustainable timber and NTFP harvesting for subsistence as well as \ncommercial purposes have resulted in the decline and degradation of forest resources. Forest \ncover loss and depleted growing stock have reduced the extent and growth potential of these \nforests, undermining their watershed and biodiversity conservation potential and effectiveness. \nInadequate  forest  resource  planning  and  management  capacities,  and  outdated  resource \ndevelopment  technologies  and  practices  of  the  concerned  line  agencies  and  communities \nhinder forests and forestry from meeting local and national economic development needs and \npriorities, especially by ensuring food security and creating jobs. \n \nB.   Development Strategy for the Nam Ngum River Basin \n \n12.  The development strategy for NNRB is based, inter alia, on the following assumptions: \n \n(i)  Agricultural  development  in  the  upper  basin  should  consider  mainly  poverty \nreduction and sustainable environmental management.  \n(ii)  Planning and implementation of development interventions, unlike a conventional \napproach, should be based on hydraulic boundaries rather than administrative \nones\u2014provincial and district\u2014and subprojects should thus encompass sub- or \nmicrowatersheds. ", "30  Appendix 6 \n(iii)  Improvement in crop productivity (especially of rice) will reduce poverty and help \nreduce the incidence of shifting cultivation, thereby improving soil structure in \ndegraded watersheds. \n(iv)  Better livestock management and disease control will reduce poverty and the \nincidence of free grazing in critical watersheds. \n(v)  Forest and biodiversity conservation are important (probably on a global scale, \nand certainly as far as the Mekong riparian countries are concerned), especially \nin the upper basin areas. Forest restoration and sustainable NTFP management, \nusing appropriate community-based management practices, will reduce poverty \nand improve watersheds. \n(vi)  The NN-1 reservoir provides livelihood to over 20,000 people and is an important \nsource of protein. Restoration and sustainable management of the upper basin \nwill maintain the quality of water and improve the water retention capacity of the \nsubwatersheds, thereby prolonging the period of inflow into the reservoir. \n(vii)  By maintaining the flow of good quality of water into the reservoir, the quality of \nfisheries, and drinking and irrigation water can be ensured. By prolonging the \nperiod of water inflow through forest restoration and soil structure improvement, \nhydropower generation capacity of the NN-1 reservoir can be better regulated \nand increased and some floods mitigated. \n(viii)  To achieve these goals, effective coordination among all relevant water sector \nline agencies and provincial departments is imperative. The capacity of these \ninstitutions  and  communities  must  be  strengthened  and  a  closer  working \nrelationship  established  among  them  to  enable  them  to  share  data  and \ninformation and synergize their activities. \n \nC.  Subproject Selection Criteria \n \n13.  Based on NNRB\u2019s development strategy, the main elements of subproject selection \nwere determined as follows: \n \n(i)  All subproject areas will comprise a micro- or subwatershed, implying that the \nbasic  planning  unit  will  encompass  a  hydraulic  boundary.  Micro-  and \nsubwatersheds will be prioritized by studying the land-use patterns in detail by \nemploying geographical information system techniques. \n(ii)  Social and economic characteristics of the population will be studied in detail by \nemploying  participatory  rural  assessment  techniques.  Those  micro-  and/or \nsubwatersheds where 25% or more of the population is living below the poverty \nline will be preferred. Ethnic groups and women did not equally benefit from \nprevious development projects. This Project will create a conducive environment \nand  allocate  appropriate  resources  to  improve  their  access  to  development \nopportunities. Micro- and/or subwatersheds will be preferred where minorities \nand women are ensured equal participation in project activities. \n(iii)  An  initial  environmental  assessment  of  the  proposed  micro-  and/or \nsubwatershed  will  be  carried  out  following  government  and  ADB  guidelines. \nThose micro- and/or subwatersheds where the level of degradation and loss of \nbiodiversity is higher will be preferred.  \n(iv)  Although the economic viability of a micro- and/or subwatershed is difficult to \ndetermine, only those will be selected that demonstrate significant development \npotential, i.e., that have large degraded areas and a critical mass of people to \nsupport project activities.  \n ", "Appendix 6  31 \nD.  Selected Core Subprojects \n \n14.  By employing the above subproject selection criteria during the feasibility study, five core \nsubproject  areas  have  been  selected  to  initiate  project  activities  (Table  A6).  These \nsubwatersheds have 90 villages or 5,811 households with an estimated total population of \n38,658. Total cultivated area is 4,520 ha (or 2% of the total cultivated area of NNRB), of which \n3,000 ha (66%) is lowland rain-fed rice. Supplementary wet-season irrigation supports only \nabout 250 ha of rice land. The rest (about 1,270 ha) is an upland mix of cash crops, vegetables, \nand fruit trees. Shifting cultivation is practiced on another 31,200 ha. Following the same \nselection criteria, additional subproject areas will be selected to replicate investment activities \nduring project implementation. \n \nTable A6: Salient Features of the Selected Subprojects \n \nSubprojects/  Nam Toum- Nam   Nam   Nam  Nam  \nSubwatersheds  Kha-Piang  Xan  Muay  Pha-Yen  Chia-Hao \n \nProvince  Xieng Khouang  Vientiane  Xaisomboun/  Xaisomboun/  Xaisomboun/ \nVientiane   Vientiane  Xieng Khouang \nDistrict  Pek  Long Xan  Phoun  Xaisomboun  Xaisomboun \n           \nTotal Land Area (km2)  254  783  482  464  501 \nForest Cover Area  72%  96%  98%  68%  69% \nShifting Cultivation Area (ha)  1,300  21,400  3,800  2,400  500 \nAgricultural Area (ha)  4,800  2,350  480  465  1,000 \nVillages (no.)  21  28  21  9  11 \nHouseholds (no.)  1,040  2,094  1,063  420  1,194 \nPopulation (no.)  7,317  14,690  6,099  2,516  8,036 \nPopulation Density (persons/km2)  28  19  13  5  16 \nElevation above MSL (m)  > 1000  200-700  200-700  600-1000  > 1000 \nBiodiversity Potential  Low  High  High  High  Low \nNational Biodiversity  No  Yes  No  No  No \nConservation Area \nDistance from Vientiane City (km)  220  90  130  170  130 \n \nMSL = Mean Sea Level \n ", "32  Appendix  7 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n \nA.

Approximately 39% of the country\u2019s 5 million people \nlive below the poverty line. However, in rural areas poverty is pervasive and as much as 65% of the \nrural population in many areas of the county is considered poor. The poor in the Nam Ngum River \nBasin (NNRB) are concentrated in the upper basin; ethnic groups, including the Khmou, Yao, and \nHmong; and former lowland Lao. The intensity of poverty measured in terms of food security is much \nhigher among the ethnic groups. The Project is expected to significantly reduce poverty by improving \nhousehold food security through: (i) increased crop and livestock productivity; (ii) better access to land \nand forest resources; and (iii) training, and extension. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                     Proposed Classification \n   \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?   Poverty reduction \nParticipatory poverty analysis using both quantitative and \nqualitative indicators is necessary. Most men and women  \ndefine poverty as food insecurity. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholder Analysis. During project preparation, stakeholder analysis included government officials \nat all levels; mass organizations, i.e., LAO Front for National Construction (LFNC), Lao Women\u2019s Union \n(LWU); local communities, particularly ethnic groups; poor women, and NGOs. Participatory rural \nassessments (PRAs) were carried out separately with poor men and women. The Project will promote \na fully participatory approach by encouraging the organization of resource-user and women\u2019s groups at \nthe village level by mass organizations and NGOs. Training in participatory approaches, gender \nsensitivity, and ethnic issues will be provided to the implementing agencies. Participatory training will \nbe  imparted  in  crop  productivity  improvement;  livestock  management;  and  forest  restoration. \nSustainable  harvesting  of  nontimber  forest  products  will  be  promoted  using  peoples\u2019  expertise \nwherever applicable; especially, women will be organized for participation and training. Poverty impact \nassessments will be conducted through PRAs. \n \nParticipation Strategy. The project participation strategy focuses on community-based mobilization \nand organization of the poor, disadvantaged, and particularly women and ethnic groups.

", "34  Appendix 8 \nSAMPLE INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION  \nNAM TOUM-KHA-PIANG SUBPROJECT  \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  Optimal use of water resources in the country is the long-term goal of the Project. Two \nimmediate  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  (i)  foster  and  institutionalize  Integrated  Water \nResources Management (IWRM) in the mainstream management process of the Government at \nthe central, provincial, and district levels; and (ii) support investment interventions in relatively \ndegraded  parts  of  Nam  Ngum  River  Basin  (NNRB)  to  ensure  sustainable  watershed \nmanagement and to provide livelihood opportunities for the poor and ethnic groups. The Project \nhas three main components: (i) IWRM, (ii) reservoir management and river basin modeling, and \n(iii) watershed management. \n \n2.  During the feasibility study, 5 core subprojects were selected following an agreed upon \nselection criteria (Appendix 6). These subprojects encompass subwatershed boundaries. An \ninitial environmental examination (IEE) for one of the subprojects, Nam Toum-Kha-Piang, has \nbeen carried out as a sample for IEE of other subprojects. The IEE covers a wide scope of \npotential environmental impacts associated with these interventions. The IEE follows guidelines \nprovided by Environmental Assessment Requirements of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nEnvironmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Agriculture  and  Natural  Resources  Development \nProjects,  and  Handbook  for  Incorporation  of  Integrated  Pest  Management  in  Agriculture \nProjects.  Host-country  guidelines  taken  into  account  include  the  Environmental  Impact \nAssessment Regulation of the Science, Technology, and Environment Agency (STEA) of the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR).  \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n3.  The objective of the Project is to provide productive livelihood opportunities to poor \nethnic groups, thereby, ensuring long-term sustainability of the subwatershed. The proposed \nactivities  will  include  (i)  capacity  building,  (ii)  crop  productivity  improvement,  (iii)  livestock \nmanagement, and (iv) forest restoration. The Project is not expected to have any adverse \nimpact on the environment, therefore, it was assigned Category B. In fact, project activities are \nexpected to have a significant positive impact on poverty and the environment.  \n \n4.  Capacity Building. This activity will strengthen the capacity of counterpart staff in the \nprovincial and district departments as well as train the potential beneficiaries. No direct adverse \nenvironmental impacts are expected from this component. \n  \n5.  Crop  Productivity  Improvement.  Crop  productivity  is  low  due  to  farmers\u2019  lack  of \naccess to modern technological package and their inefficient farm practices. This activity will \ntarget degraded parts of the subproject and those with special environmental concerns for the \nwater sector. Outputs will include (i) more productive and stable farming systems, and (ii) \nimproved food security. As a result shifting cultivation will reduce considerably.  \n \n6.  Livestock Management. This activity will improve livestock management practices by \n(i)  utilizing  improved  forage  technologies,  (ii)  modifying  grazing  practices  to  emphasize \nmanaged rather than free-range grazing of cattle, (iii) identifying major livestock diseases and \ntheir appropriate treatment, and (iv) developing a farmer-centered extension system at the \nvillage level. Interventions in the fishery subsector will extend fish technology to the village level. \n ", " Appendix  8          35  \n7.  Forest Restoration. The Project will use framework species technology for restoring \ndegraded natural forest area with crown cover ranging between 20-40%. Using agroforestry \ntechnologies, the Project will improve forest condition and production of timber and nontimber \nforest  products  (NTFP)  over  state  and  commune  forest  lands.  Individual  and/or  groups  of \nhouseholds will be involved in this activity.  \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n8.  NNRB,  in  north-central  Lao  PDR,  covers  an  area  of  approximately  16,906  square \nkilometres (km2). The upper basin, that covers about 8,297 km2, is the catchment area for Nam \nNgum 1 reservoir. NNRB extends northeast from the Vientiane waterfront about 400 km to \nXieng  Khouang  and  is  equivalent  to  about  2.73%  of  the  entire  lower  Mekong  basin.  The \ncatchment outlet is 157 meters (m) above sea level, and the highest point is 2,682 m above sea \nlevel. Less than one third lies below 300 m above sea level.  \n \n9.  The Nam Toum-Kha-Piang subproject is in Xieng Khouang Province, which is in the \nuppermost part of the basin (Basin MAP). It has a catchment area of 254 km2 with a population \nof 7,317 (1,040 households) spread in 21 villages. Most (91%) households make living in \nagriculture. With average annual rainfall of 1,300\u20132,000 millimeters, the annual water usage is \nabout 2.12% of the Nam Ngum annual discharge. Land ranges from large and small flat valley \nfloors to rolling uplands 1,100\u20131,500 m or more above sea level. Most flat valley floors have \nbeen developed into paddy fields with traditional and modern irrigation. About 81% of the \nsubproject area has a forest cover and shifting cultivation is practiced on about 1,300 ha (Land \nUse MAP).  \n \n10.  Studies in 1991\u20131995 confirmed low nutrient status and phosphate deficiency in most \nareas of the basin. The upper basin has low fertility, and highly acid soils are common in Xieng \nKhouang. Whether soil acidity affects the aquatic environment is not known. The other areas in \nthe upper basin are karstic with basic soils. Continuing loss of forest cover and soil degradation \nis threatening productivity and increasing stream flow variability, since water storage in the \nforest litter, soil, and subsoil zones are reduced.  \n \n11.  Total forest area for NNRB was estimated at 5,000 km2 or 28% cover in 1997. However, \nforest types have changed significantly, notably with a loss of mixed dense forest caused by \nselective logging. Wood and scrubland account for 40% of the basin. The forest in the upper \nbasin is highly fragmented while the lower basin has little remaining forest cover. Collection of \nNTFP is a major secondary activity for many farm households in NNRB, especially in the upper \nbasin. It has a comparative advantage in these products because its forest cover is more \nextensive than that of Thailand, People's Republic of China, and Viet Nam, whose forests have \nlong since virtually disappeared. NTFP and niche products include cardamom, benzoin, paper \nmulberry, medicinal plants, wild herbs, wild orchids, and ferns.  \n \n12.  Widespread poverty is the major development challenge, particularly in the upper basin. \nOver 65% of the population lives below the poverty line of $11.2 per person per month. The \npoverty gap index for Xieng Khouang is 2.9. Abundant natural resources in the basin once \nprovided  sustenance  for  local  communities,  but  these  resources  are  dwindling  due  to \noverexploitation as more and more poor people search for food or sell forest and NTFPs to pay \nfor health, education, and consumption costs.  \n \n \n \n   ", "36  Appendix 8 \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n13.  The  proposed  subproject  activities  will  lead  to  more  efficient  management  of  the \nwatershed, which will improve water conservation, provide sustainable livelihoods, and restore \nforests. As a result, human pressure on the environment will decrease:  \n \n(i)   Improved crop yields either from irrigated or nonirrigated agriculture, combined \nwith crop diversification (e.g., to fruit trees), will reduce swidden agriculture;  \n(ii)   Reduced grazing pressure on forests will allow greater regeneration of woody \nspecies, increasing diversity and abundance; and \n(iii)   Selection and propagation of local NTFPs will increase the intraspecific diversity \nof selected species. \n \n14.  In general, most negative environmental project impacts will result from three physical \ninvestment  activities,  but  most  will  be  minor  and  confined  to  (i)  inappropriate  selection  of \nlocation  for  interventions;  (ii)  inappropriate  selection  of  tree  species  or  varieties;  (iii) \nindiscriminate  use  of  agrochemicals;  and  (iv)  health  and  safety  issues  of  small-scale \nconstruction (e.g., weirs). Potential impacts for each physical investment activity are as follows: \n \n15.  Crop Productivity. This intervention will improve crop productivity but with little or no \nuse of fertilizers and pesticides. The Lao-International Rice Research Institute\u2019s high yielding \nvarieties,  suited  for  upper  basin,  do  not  require  use  of  chemical  inputs.  Besides,  this \ntechnological package encourages integrated pest and nutrient management.  \n \n16.  Fertilizer use in Lao PDR has always been low but it is increasing. During the field \ninvestigations,  a  range  of  fertilizer  application  rates  were  reported.  In  Vientiane  Province, \nfarmers use nitrogen-phosphorous-potassium (NPK) fertilizer at about 100 kg/ha for wet season \nrice, and 250 kg/ha for dry-season rice. Fertilizer usage in the upper basin is negligible because \nof weak input markets, and generally farmers cannot afford cash inputs. \n \n17.  Livestock Improvement. Livestock can have a wide variety of positive or negative \neffects on rangeland ecosystems, and grazing impacts can be seen at the species, community, \nand landscape levels. Grazing has impacts on individual plants or species, plant communities, \nsoils and watersheds, and wildlife. Overgrazing frequently changes the composition of the plant \nand animal population. Some effects are the direct result of heavy grazing and occur rapidly, \nothers are more indirect and may take decades to occur. Accordingly, the proposed project \ninterventions need to incorporate a program to monitor effects of livestock on various ecosystem \ntypes  in  the  subproject  area  to  minimize  detrimental  impacts  while  supporting  good \nmanagement practice. \n \n18.  Forest Restoration. Restoring previously forested areas has only positive impacts. \nCertain concerns, however, include the selection of species to be introduced (e.g., fruit trees, \neucalyptus, teak) and how the activity will affect the overall farming system. The Government \npolicy is to avoid growing eucalyptus in upper basin as it damages soil structure. Teak is a \npossible commercial species, but its plantations have to be accessible to transport and other \ninfrastructure. Orchards are good in principle, but their impact on the general environment \nrequires a review and preparation of possible mitigation measures as the project progresses. \n \n \n \n ", " Appendix  8          37  \nE.   Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n19.  The  Environmental  Protection  Law  (Decree  068/PM)  was  passed  in  1999.  The \nregulations for environmental impact assessment were completed last year with assistance from \nADB. STEA is responsible for overall coordination of environmental issues and management \nand it reports to the Office of the Prime Minister. Recently, STEA established branch offices in \nsix  provinces  in  northern  and  southern  Lao  PDR  to  develop  environmental  management \ncapacity at the provincial level. However, due to insufficient capacity of STEA branches and the \nprovincial departments of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the project should provide \nthem with training to ensure that proposed mitigation measures of the IEE would be well \nunderstood and implemented.  \n \n20.  Since the scope for each project activity has not been finalized, environmental officials \nand provincial counterpart staff should annually visit all village interventions in the subproject. \nThe visits will cover construction and management phases of the project and involve a checklist \nof (i) locations (Are they impacting on any form of designated protection forest or conservation \narea?); (ii) species (Have any alien species or varieties been used?); (iii) agrochemicals (Have \nany been used injudiciously, damaging peoples\u2019 health or nontarget species?); and (iv) health \nand safety. The concerned Project Implementation Unit (PIU) must prepare monthly reports on \nland use and health and safety and submit the same to Office of the National Project Manager.  \n \n21.  To ensure that all applicable national and provincial environmental laws, regulations, and \nstandards,  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  environmental  requirements,  will  be  met  during  project \nimplementation and operation, an environmental monitoring plan (EMP) will be prepared during \nthe start-up phase of the Project. At least, one domestic environment consultant for about 2 \nperson-months, and an environment counterpart staff need to be recruited for the PIU to ensure \nthat EMP is well prepared, and that proposed mitigation measures identified in the IEE will be \nincorporated in project design, construction, and operation. The cost of implementing proposed \nmitigation measures and of recruiting the consultant will be borne by the Project.  \n \nF.  Conclusions and Recommendations \n \n22.  This subproject involves capacity building of Government staff and local communities for \nwatershed management as well as crop productivity improvement, livestock management, and \nforest restoration. In general, the proposed activities will increase household incomes, ensure \nsustainable  livelihoods,  and  improve  water  resources  of  the  subwatershed  (subproject). \nPotential negative environmental impacts of this subproject may include those resulting from (i) \ninappropriate  use  of  agrochemicals  impacting  on  water  quality  and  human  health,  (ii) \novergrazing  or  inappropriate  pasture  management,  and  (iii)  inappropriate  selection  of  tree \nspecies or varieties. Negative impacts, however, will be limited in duration and extent, and can \nbe mitigated using guidelines, technological controls, and regulatory mechanisms already in \nplace.  Therefore,  a  detailed  environmental  impact  assessment  for  this  subproject  is  not \nwarranted. \n   ", " \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \n \nTable A9.1 Cost Summary by Components \n($\u2019000) \n \n    %  % Total \n          Foreign  Base \n  Local  Foreign  Total  Exchange Costs \n   \n1.

About  239  person-months  of  international  and  413  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting services will be required to support project implementation and capacity building. The \nconsulting services will be recruited in two packages. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will \nfinance one package of 137 person-months of international and 201 person-months of domestic \nconsultants.  Agence  Francaise  de  Developpement  (AFD)  will  finance,  in  parallel,  another \npackage of 102 person-months of international and 212 person-months of domestic consulting \nservices. A detailed breakdown of both consulting packages is in Table A11. To ensure effective \ncoordination among all three project components, the position of the team leader and those of \nother key consultants will be financed through the ADB package. All consultants would be \nrequired to work under the guidance of the team leader following specific terms of reference \n(TOR) based on a consolidated work plan. Outline TOR for each of the three components, their \nassociated activities, and project management are provided below. Specific and detailed TOR \nare provided in the supplementary appendixes. \n \nA.  Integrated Water Resources Management Component  \n \n2.  The  consultants,  consisting  of  an  integrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM) \nspecialist  and  a  number  of  other  short-term  specialists,  will  help  the  Water  Resources \nCoordination Committee (WRCC) plan, develop, and manage water resources in Nam Ngum \nRiver Basin (NNRB) and at the national level, as applicable. The consultants will help coordinate \nthe work of other water sector agencies, as well. The WRCC Mandate (1999) requires WRCC to \n\u201cencourage, support, and promote the exchange of data and information relevant to water and \nwater resources.\u201d The Draft Policy on Water and Water Resources (2000) recommends actions \nfor data management. To meet these objectives, the consultants will help (i) develop a detailed \ndata and information management strategy; (ii) prepare regulations, data-sharing agreements, \netc.;  (iii)  review,  update,  and  disseminate  the  metadata  directory  established  earlier;  (iv) \nfacilitate  data  sharing  between  national  agencies  and  provinces,  and  between  project \ncomponents; (v) prepare proposals for review and upgrade data collection networks and data \nmanagement systems (at the national, provincial, and river-basin levels); and (vi) prepare and \nmaintain a water resource information system for WRCC.  \n \n3.  During the Project, a coordinated and capable planning process and partnership should \nbe built between the WRCC Secretariat (WRCCS), Hydropower Office (HPO), and Integrated \nWatershed Management Unit (IWMU); and the various sectoral interests balanced. This process \nshould  be  based  on  good  information,  planning  tools,  and  stakeholder  participation,  and \nintegrated with the decentralized and bottom-up approach to planning. The WRCCS is expected \nprimarily  to  coordinate  river  basin  planning,  although  with  the  establishment  of  sufficient \ntechnical capacity to oversee the entire process and, with the NNRB Committee (and similar \nfuture committees), to lead the process of stakeholder consultation and conflict resolution. \nSpecific outputs will include (i) development of detailed procedures and roles for WRCC, HPO, \nIWMU, river basin committees, and other key participants in the preparation of river basin plans, \nincluding plan approval and implementation procedures; and (ii) preparation of an integrated \nmanagement plan for NNRB, and additional river basin plans, if appropriate. \n \n4.  Most IWRM functions are new. Managers and technical staff need considerable training \nto  build  capacity  for  sustainable  implementation  of  IWRM.  Training  under  the  Project  is \nexpected to include a wide range of activities such as fellowships for staff to study abroad, \ninternational study tours; support for dissertations by visiting scholars; workshops; and training \nin English language, computer skills, management, and training of trainers.  The WRCCS will ", "Appendix 11  45 \ncoordinate  IWRM  training  across  all  project  components;  and  activities  of  all  appropriate \nnational ministries and agencies, participating provinces, and other local authorities in NNRB. \nThe WRCCS will appoint a staff person to serve as training coordinator and will need an \ninterministry working group or coordinating committee on training. Activities and objectives \ninclude (i) assessing training needs of WRCC, HPO, IWMU, NNRBC, and involved provinces; \n(ii) preparing a coordinated training plan; (iii) facilitating implementation of the training plan, \ndrawing on training budgets under each project component; and (iv) evaluating training results \nand recommending ongoing training activities. \n \n5.  Communication  and  awareness  raising  involve  delivery  of  information  and  general \nknowledge, often to broader target groups than in training. They can include senior officials, \nmanagers, and staff who are only indirectly involved in water resource management, water \nusers, students in the public education system, and the general public. Communication and \nawareness activities should be carried out according to a strategy that identifies target groups, \ntheir information and awareness needs, and priorities. The communication and awareness \nstrategy should indicate how project activities would be coordinated with other ongoing water, \nnatural resource, and environmental awareness activities such as through the mass media and \npublic  education  curricula.  Communication  activities  should  also  ensure  openness  and \ntransparency in IWRM decision making. Activities of WRCC and other agencies, to the extent \npossible,  should  be  made  public.    Consultation  on  draft  policy  and  legal  decisions,  water \nresource  planning  scenarios,  and  similar  topics  should  be  carried  out  with  stakeholders.  \nSpecific  outputs  will  include  (i)  development  of  a  communication  and  awareness  strategy, \nincluding communication on WRCCS activities; (ii) communication and awareness activities \naccording to the agreed-on strategy; and (iii) training and other capacity building for ongoing \ncommunication and awareness activities. \n \nB.  Reservoir Management and River Basin Modeling Component \n \n6.   Both activities in this component are integrated such that river basin modeling provides \nthe tool for the reservoir management studies and will be managed by the same team of \nconsultants. The consultants will work in close coordination with HPO counterpart staff. The \nmain objective of this component is to provide capacity building for HPO and other related \nagencies in configuring and calibrating a river basin model, and in analyzing and interpreting \ndata to ensure the effective use of the model as a planning tool to operate the Nam Ngum 1 \n(NN-1) reservoir. Any changed conditions in the river basin must be incorporated into the model. \nTrain-the-trainer courses in river basin modeling will be provided to support on-the-job training \nof domestic specialists and counterpart staff, who will train WRCCS, HPO (including Electricite \nDu Lao [EDL] staff and operators of NN-1), and MAF.    \n \n7.  The river basin modeling will, apart from capacity building, provide (i) a calibrated model \nfor  NNRB;  and  (ii)  agreed-on  bulk  sharing  of  the  water  resources  in  NNRB  with  the \nstakeholders, which will, inter alia, give EDL a clear mandate for hydropower generation in \nNNRB under the Water Law. After identification of the water users, collection of data, and \nreview to ensure the quality of the data, the appropriate model will be selected and calibrated. In \nthe  modeling,  considerations  should  be  given  to  consistency  with  the  Mekong  River \nCommission\u2019s Water Utilization Program. The model will include the main water-using activities \nin NNRB, including hydropower, irrigation, flood mitigation, water supply, fisheries, and riverine \nenvironmental  maintenance.  Stakeholders  in  NNRB  will  be  consulted  on  development  and \nmanagement scenarios to be modeled, and on the results of the modeling for agreement on \nbulk sharing. The results will take into account, by sensitivity analyses, changed conditions in ", "46  Appendix 11 \nNNRB, such as large-scale changes in watershed land use, significant irrigation developments, \nand implementation of other hydropower schemes. \n \n8.  The reservoir management will, apart from building capacity, (i) provide an operational \nplanning  tool  for  NN-1,  for  long-term  (seasonal  and  monthly)  planning  for  hydropower \ngeneration, based on the concept of optimum use of the water resources within the agreed-on \nbulk sharing, and for short-term (weekly and daily) planning of the reservoir for hydropower \ngeneration and flood mitigation; (ii) increase the knowledge of the various NNRB stakeholders \non the available water resources, its optimum use, and the economic benefits and costs; (iii) \nincrease readiness for flood mitigation, and understanding of flooding, in downstream NNRB; \nand (iv) increase knowledge of the meteorological and hydrological conditions in the river basin. \nA  hydrodynamic  model  of  the  area  downstream  of  NN-1  will  enable  assessment  of  flood \nmitigation possibilities and consequences of flooding under various hydrological conditions. An \neconomic model, integrated with the river basin model, will enable assessment of benefits and \ncosts of various water uses to (i) determine optimum use of the water resources, and (ii) \ndetermine economic viability of flood control operation of NN-1.   \n \nC.  Watershed Management Component \n \n9.  The main thrust of this component is transfer of appropriate technology to farming \ncommunities in upper NNRB. Consultants experienced in Lao agriculture, especially with the \ntried and tested agricultural extension methodologies in the successful previous projects, will \nprovide technical services. The farming system approach will be adopted to crop productivity \nimprovement, effective and affordable interventions in livestock management, and joint forestry \nmanagement and forest restoration. Consultants will help provincial and district counterpart staff \n(i) design, develop, and implement on-farm demonstration trials; (ii) develop training programs \nand material for staff as well as community training, and impart training; and (iii) conduct project \nbenefit monitoring and evaluation.   \n \n10.  Capacity Building for IWMU. A number of planning exercises have been undertaken, \nincluding investment plans for Nakai Nam Theun 2, Nam Ngum, and Nam Ou river basins; and \nforest  management  in  Vang  Vieng.  Until  recently,  progress  in  integrated  watershed \nmanagement in MAF has mainly been in developing concepts and guidelines, with some efforts \nin  capacity  building.  The  consultants  will  further  develop  the  conceptual  framework  and \nguidelines based on experience gained through additional training and model development. \nStaff capacity is still inadequate, especially at the district level. The consultant will help IWMU (i) \nbuild capacity for tasks ranging from basic communication and computer skills to planning and \ntechnical skills, (ii) coordinate a geographical information system in IWMU to support district and \nprovincial  integrated  watershed  planning,  (iii)  develop  detailed  subwatershed  plans  for  the \nProject, and (iv) develop skills and networking to ensure that IWRM is used in provincial- and \ndistrict-level planning. \n \n11.  Crop Productivity Improvement. Due to high rainfall in upper NNRB, rice is the main \ncrop grown on flat valley beds during the wet season. Improvement in rice productivity will \nencompass testing of new varieties, determining the optimum management strategy for fields \nexposed to different water levels (slightly flooded, heavily flooded), as well as calibrating nutrient \nmanagement.  Farmers\u2019  decision  to  produce  dry-season  crops\u2014maize,  legumes,  or \nvegetables\u2014depends on the level of rice self-sufficiency achieved during the wet season. On \nsloping  uplands,  sweet  potatoes,  cassava,  and  horticulture  as  well  as  upland  rice  (on \nnonsloping land) will be tested. The potential of growing medicinal plants or new types of plants \nthat have been proven successful elsewhere in the country (e.g., paper mulberry) will also be ", "Appendix 11  47 \ndetermined. Crop diversification will be investigated. Integrated pest management techniques \nwill be adopted and calibrated for wider application in the subproject areas to safeguard water \nquality of inflows into Nam Ngum 1. To improve on-farm irrigation efficiencies, field trials will be \nconducted  and  appropriate  knowledge  imparted  to  beneficiaries.  The  possibility  of  micro-\nirrigation  will  also  be  explored.  For  rice  seed  multiplication,  a  structured  program  will  be \ndeveloped in close consultation with farm communities, and the possibility of an agribusiness \nand/or cooperative enterprise for seed production explored. The upper NNRB is envisaged as a \n\u201csemiprotected\u201d area, emphasizing organic farming to preserve the quality of its water resources \nand biodiversity.  \n \n12.  Livestock Improvement. The consultants will develop (i) a farmer-based animal health \nprogram,  (ii)  village-based  extension  program  emphasizing  female  training,  and  (iii)  better \nlinkages with the market. Subwatershed livestock management committees will be established \nby building on existing rural institutions but ensuring that hitherto excluded groups (women and \nethnic minorities) are also included. Pilot program in schools will be developed and conducted to \ndevelop  greater  awareness  of  watershed  management  issues,  and  study  tours  to  other \nsubwatersheds in NNRB and elsewhere in the country. To support development activities in \nfisheries,  experts  will  collaborate  with  and  build  upon  the  experience  of  the  Provincial \nAquaculture  Development  Project  of  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization-United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme. The experts will help decentralize hatcheries, extend village fish \ntechnology,  and  develop  fish  cultivators  groups  in  existing  community-based  management \ngroups. The forage and feed specialists will (i) introduce improved forage technologies and \nmodifications  to  existing  grazing  practices,  emphasizing  managed  rather  than  free-range \ngrazing of cattle; and (ii) help farmers utilize better-quality feed by demonstrating weight-gain \nand labor-saving animal programs. The animal health specialists will be familiar with main \ninfectious  and  nutritional  diseases  in  ruminants  and  pigs  and  poultry.  The  specialists  will \ndevelop and help implement vaccination programs and prepare recommendations to control \nlivestock movements. \n \n13.  Forest Restoration. The specialists will develop a joint forest management program \nfor  sustainable  management  of  forests  and  nontimber  forest  products  (NTFPs)  with  the \nparticipating communities. The specialists will work with the counterpart staff and user groups to \n(i) develop a forest resource management strategy for the subprojects, based on national forest \nsector development plans and policies; (ii) involve women and nongovernment organizations; \n(iii) promote usufruct sharing; (iv) set up demonstration plots; (v) train beneficiaries in NTFP-\nbased livelihood systems, covering NTFP regeneration, harvesting, processing, and marketing; \nand  (vi)  train  beneficiaries  in  area-specific  agroforestry  models  that  can  replace  shifting \ncultivation, including selection of agricultural crops and forest species, nursery techniques, and \nmanagement regimes. \n \nD.  Project Management \n \n14.  Project management consultants will support the Office of the National Project Manager \nby (i) developing a consolidated work plan; (ii) coordinating project implementation, including \nadministrative, technical, and financial functions; (iii) ensuring that the social and environmental \nguidelines of the Government and ADB are followed in implementing project activities; and (iv) \nsupervising the project benefit monitoring and evaluation program. The team leader, engaged \nunder the ADB package, will provide overall leadership for all project components and activities \nand supervise all project consultants, including those engaged under the AFD package. All \nconsultants will follow a consolidated work plan to ensure effective coordination among all \nproject components and activities.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Nam Ngum River Basin (NNRB) covers a large area, about 16,906 km2 (the upper \nwatershed covers about half of this area) in north central part of the country. The annual \naverage rainfall ranges from 1,400-3,000 millimeter. Most of the 575,000 rural population1 in the \nupper watershed has a significant ethnic diversity and is highly mobile\u201460% move at least once \na  year.  Incidence  of  poverty  is  high  as  about  40%  of  the  population  reports  annual  rice \nshortages for four months or longer. Over 65% of the rural population lives below the poverty \nline  of  $11.20  per  capita  per  month.2  The  widespread  poverty  is  the  major  development \nchallenge, particularly in the upper NNRB. Poverty in NNRB is not synonymous with hunger. In \nthe past, abundant water resources provided sustenance for poor villagers but these resources \nare now dwindling and showing signs of overexploitation as more and more poor people search \nfor  food,  forest,  and  non-timber  forest  products  (NTFPs)  to  meet  health,  education,  and \nconsumption expenses. This Project will help address some of these problems in NNRB. \n \n2.  The optimal use of water resources in NNRB is the Project\u2019s long-term goal. The Project \nobjectives are to: (i) foster integrated water resources management (IWRM) among the line \nagencies and provincial departments; and (ii) support investment interventions in critical and \ndegraded upper watersheds to (a) mitigate floods, (b) increase water use efficiency, (c) improve \nfarming systems\u2019 productivity to ensure food security and increase household cash incomes, \nand (d) preserve forests.  \n \nB.  Project Benefits \n \n3.  Benefits would be generated by a number of Project activities. At the national level, \nProject benefits will arise from optimal use of water resources by institutionalizing IWRM. More \nefficient management of the Nam Ngum-1 (NN-1) reservoir will improve water conservation and \nmitigate floods. Other benefits will stem from the efficient use of water in agriculture leading to \nincreased crop productivity and household incomes. Adoption of improved land-use practices \nincluding forest development will maintain the water quality in the long run and add to household \nincomes. At the grassroots level, integrated agricultural extension activities of the watershed \nmanagement component will target poor areas in upper NNRB. Major beneficiaries will include \nethnic groups and women. \n \n  1.  Nonquantified Benefits \n \n4.  Each  of  the  three  Project  components  contains  capacity  building  activities.  IWRM \ncomponent will be fully utilized to strengthening the institutional capacity of Water Resources \nCoordination Committee. Although capacity building will generate significant benefits both in the \nshort- as well as in the long run but direct benefits of these activities cannot be quantified. \nSimilarly,  the  benefits  of  integrated  watershed  planning  will  improve  water  and  land  use \nefficiencies and help implement water allocation rights but the intended benefits are hard to \nestimate. Therefore, the Project benefit stream does not include any estimate of such benefits. \nThe  approximate  cost  of  these  activities  amounts  to  about  25%  of  the  total  Project  cost. \n                                                 \n1  This estimate does not include the population of Vientiane Municipality and surrounding plains that is estimated to \nbe another one million. \n2  The Government has set the consumption poverty line at 2100 kilocalories per capita per day that is roughly \nequivalent to $11.20 per capita per month. ", "                     Appendix 12  51\nAlthough benefits of capacity building cannot be quantified but these activities are critical to help \nrealize the benefits of investments activities. For instance, proper planning and implementation \nof sustainable interventions would be difficult without further capacity building of the relevant \ndepartments.  Upper  watershed  management  planning  cannot  be  carried  out  without  due \nconsideration to reservoir management and river basin modeling parameters; and to coordinate \nboth these activities, IWRM has to be institutionalized. It is this interdependence of activities in \nall three components that is critical to the realization of overall Project benefits. And capacity \nbuilding is a prerequisite to successfully implement these activities. \n \n2.  Quantified Benefits \n \n5.  Most Project benefits will stem from two main sets of activities: (i) improved hydropower \ngeneration  as  a  result  of  better  reservoir  management;  and  (ii)  improved  watershed \nmanagement through integrated agricultural extension. These benefits have been quantified \nand included in the benefit stream. The approximate cost of these activities amounts to about \n75% of the total Project cost. \n \nC.  Evaluation Methodology and Assumptions  \n \n6.  The  analysis  draws  together  the  investment  costs  of  the  Project  during  six-year  \nimplementation period (2003-2008), plus the recurrent costs needed to ensure sustainable \nbenefits. These costs are then compared with the estimated direct benefits, over a 30-year \nperiod. Rice and maize have been valued at their border price equivalent of farmgate prices.3 All \nother inputs and outputs, have been valued at competitive market prices, after adjusting for \ntaxes, duties and an implicit over-valuation of the exchange rate.4 A domestic price numeraire \nhas been used. Base costs and benefits are in mid-2002 terms. Tradable goods have been \nconverted to their economic equivalent using a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.1. In the case \nof unskilled labor, a shadow wage rate factor of 0.6 has been used to reflect the opportunity cost \nof labor in the upper watershed. Both these macroeconomic variables have been estimated \nemploying generally accepted assumptions by other projects and sector studies. The project \ninvestment and management costs are estimated at $23.0 million. In economic prices, their \nequivalent  values  are  $22.4  million.  For  economic  analysis,  the  project  costs  cannot  be \nsegregated by component or by subproject because (i) many activities of all three components \noverlap, and (ii) activities and several fixed costs under the watershed management component \nare non-divisible (not least because subproject boundaries cut across district and provincial \nboundaries). Therefore, this analysis has been carried out based on desegregated cost and \nconsolidated benefit streams for the whole Project. \n \n  1.  Optimal Reservoir Management \n \n7.  Currently,  the  operational  rules  of  NN-1  reservoir  do  not:  (i)  optimize  hydropower \ngeneration  for  want  of  better  inflow  forecasting  and  absence  of  river  basin  modeling;  (ii) \nconsider downstream impacts on flooding in the Vientiane Plains during the wet season; and (iii) \nmeet water shortages for domestic consumption and irrigation during the dry season. The \nreservoir management and river basin modeling component will develop new operational rules \noptimizing water resources in the whole NNRB. It is estimated that better inflow forecasting \ncould result in 2% increase in annual hydropower generation valued at $600,000.5 Every four \n                                                 \n3 All relevant detailed tables are provided in the Supplementary Appendix 2. \n4 In this analysis, the exchange rate of KN10,200/$1.0, prevalent at the time, has been used. \n5 This assumes an additional annual hydropower generation of 20 GWh valued at $0.03/kWh (for export to Thailand).  ", "52   Appendix 12 \nyears there are significant floods in the Mekong River and its tributaries in NNRB. Backwater \nfrom Mekong River can cause flood damage independent of releases from the NN-1 reservoir. \nHowever, uncoordinated releases of water from NN-1 may further compound flooding in the \nPlains  and  cause  damage  to  standing  crops,  private  property,  roads,  bridges,  power \ntransmission, and communications infrastructure. Improved reservoir management rules can \nmitigate  and/or  minimize  the  impact  of  such  floods  by  creating  an  optimum  buffer  in  the \nreservoir during the wet season. Since tangible benefits of flood mitigation from this activity at \nthis stage are difficult to estimate, therefore, they are not included in this analysis. The overall \nproject benefit stream, however, accounts for $600,000 from additional revenues from increased \nand optimized peak and off-peak hydropower generation. Half of these benefits are assumed to \nmaterialize in year 3, and full benefits from year 5 onward. \n \n2.  Integrated Agricultural Extension \n \n8.  The  bulk  of  Project  investments  will  be  made  for  the  watershed  management \ncomponent. The main activities under this component will provide an integrated agricultural \nextension service to farming communities, mostly comprised of poor and ethnic groups, in the \nselected  subproject  areas.  The  farming  systems,  and  the  associated  constraints,  of  these \ncommunities have been studied in detailed. These households are resource poor and lack \nappropriate technology and training for improved farming methods. Food shortages for 3-4 \nmonths for poor households, inadequate cash income, and rising population compel households \nto overexploit forest resources of critical watersheds. \n \n9.  Communities in the upper watershed have complex farming systems. Relatively better \noff households have access to some farmland on the valley floors with wet season\u2019s residual \nirrigation. In some cases these households may also practice farming on upland slopes. Many \nhouseholds do not have access to land on valley floors and farm only in the uplands and they \noften practice shifting cultivation. Almost all households raise livestock of one type or another \nand also harvest NTFPs. To analyze the impact of integrated agricultural extension service \nactivities on such a complex set of farming systems is just as complicated. To simplify the \nanalytical  methodology,  only  two  farming  household  models,  one  for  lowland  and  one  for \nupland,  representing  typical  farm  sizes  and  land  use  in  the  subproject  areas  have  been \nprepared. Coefficients used for both models (farm size, cropping pattern, yields, and inputs) are \nbased on field surveys reported in the feasibility study and on subsequent discussions with staff \nof  the  Lao-International  Rice  Research  Institute,  Lao-International  Center  for  Tropical \nAgriculture, and International Livestock Research Institute who are involved in ongoing projects \nin the country. \n10.  In model 1, the lowland household has 0.5 ha of valley floor paddy land and 1.0 ha of \nupland. Single rain-fed rice crops are grown on each class of land. In addition, the household \nfattens two pigs a year, collects NTFPs from about 2.0 ha and raises about 15 heads of poultry. \nFood  production  from  permanently  cropped  areas  is  supplemented  by  rice,  maize,  and \nvegetables produced from about 1.2 ha of shifting cultivation. Under the Project, land use \nremains the same except that 0.2 ha of maize, grown on residual moisture on the lowland, is \nintroduced and the area of shifting cultivation falls to 0.7 ha as paddy yields increase. Changes \nin the crop mix allow a small increase in the number of pigs fattened. Poultry losses are \nassumed to fall as a result of Project activities while the value of NTFPs is expected to increase \nfollowing changes in resource management to be introduced. \n ", "                     Appendix 12  53\n11.  By contrast, in model 2, upland household has no valley floor paddy land and has 0.7 ha \nof upland, on which a single rainfed rice crop is grown. Food production from permanently \ncropped  areas  is  supplemented  by  rice,  maize,  and  vegetables  produced  under  shifting \ncultivation on about 2.0 ha a year. Two pigs are fattened and 10-15 head of poultry are raised \nevery year. Under the Project, land use on the upland area remains the same with a reduction in \nthe shifting cultivation area of about 0.5 ha. Changes in the crop production allow a small \nincrease in the number of pigs fattened. Poultry losses are assumed to fall as a result of project \nactivities while the introduction of improved forest resource management is expected to result in \nan increase in the value of NTFPs. \n12.  Each household, in both models, is assumed to have the equivalent of three adults \navailable  for  farm  work  supplying  about  650  days  of  labor  a  year.  No  hiring  of  labor  is \nenvisaged. In some areas, families may hire out some labor, but this is unlikely to exceed 30 \ndays a year. Although the selected five subproject areas were studied in more detail to better \nunderstand the pattern of land use, social, and economic constraints, both farm models have \nbeen generated and applied to the expected project area.   \n \n    a.  Crop Productivity \n \n13.  Under  the  Project,  several  new  rice  varieties  and  management  practices  will  be \nintroduced.6 No chemical plant protection will be used and only minimal quantities of inorganic \nfertilizers will be applied. Crop budgets have been prepared for the without and with-project \nscenarios. On permanently cropped areas, the assumption is made that yields are retained at \nexisting levels without-project with yield increases from new technology expected to be reached \nwithin 5 years of initial adoption. Shifting cultivation yields are assumed to decline by about 17% \nover 10 years, in without-project scenario. With the Project, lowland rice yields are assumed to \nincrease from 1.4 t/ha to 2.3 t/ha and those for upland from 1.2 t/ha to 1.9 t/ha. The yield of new \ncrop, maize, is assumed to be 2.7 t/ha. Current cropping intensity for both models is assumed to \nbe 100% and only for lowland Model 1, it is expected to increase to 113% with the Project. \n \n    b.  Livestock Management \n \n14.  Improved feeding and disease control for small animals (pigs and poultry) will be the \nmain focus of project interventions. Feed supplies (primarily by-products) will improve as crop \nyields improve and small additional areas of maize and other forage crops will be established on \nfarms. Better livestock management and vaccination programs for pigs and poultry will lead to a \nreduction in disease losses upto 40% and an improvement in growth rates.  \nc.  Forest Restoration \n \n15.  About 6,000 households will participate in a range of forestry activities on about 9,000 ha \nto grow timber and fuelwood; cultivating and harvest NTFPs; and rehabilitate degraded forests. \nAgro-forestry will be practiced as a part of upland farming systems and supplement restocking \nof degraded forests in areas adjacent to villages. Farmers will be assisted to adopt sustainable \nextraction practices for NTFPs by forming user groups to which extraction rights for specific \nareas will be allocated. This approach will allow forest areas to be rested, a requirement if \ncurrent extraction rates are to be sustained. As crop yields on more settled areas improve, \nhouseholds are expected to gradually reduce shifting cultivation that will also contribute to more \nsustainable forest use. \n                                                 \n6 Lao-IRRI has nine modern rice varieties suitable for cultivation in the upper watershed areas. ", "54   Appendix 12 \n    d.  Overall Benefits from Agricultural Extension \n \n16.  It is expected that about 10,000 households (6,500 lowland and 3,500 upland) will \nbenefit from the integrated agricultural extension activities supported by the Project. Significant \nbenefits are assumed to start from year 2 with 1,000 households participating in the Project by \nthe end of that year. Increasing number of households, i.e., 2,500, 3,000, and 3,500, will \nparticipate in the subsequent 3 years. Increments in paddy and maize production of 11,590 tons \nand  3,395  tons,  respectively,  are  projected,  together  with  significant  increments  in  pig \nproduction, forestry products, and saved poultry losses. Not all farmers will participate in all \nproject activities. Based on their current livelihood practices, most will participate in crop farming \nand livestock management and about 6,000 are expected to participate in forestry. \n17.  The  farm  budgets  described  above  have  been  used  to  estimate  incremental  farm \nhousehold income based on typical land use and activity patterns. Household incomes, at full \ndevelopment of new technologies, show substantial increases over present incomes (Table \nA12.1).7 For the upland model 2, the overall annual income of a household is expected to \nincrease by about 80%; from KN7,140,000 ($700) to KN12,954,000 ($1270). The non-cash \nincome is expected to increase from KN6,630,000 ($650) to KN9,537,000 ($935), an increase of \n34%, while the return per family day of labor would increase from KN5,000 ($0.49) per day to \nKN13,000 ($1.27) per day. It is expected that, on average, the annual cash income will increase \nby 5-6 fold; from KN510,000 ($50) to KN3,417,000 ($335). Benefits from timber, about $40 \nmillion, harvested in year 20 will provide an additional lump sum income of about $6,600 per \nhousehold.  \n18.  At the household level, the primary objective of the project interventions is to improve \nfood security for the beneficiaries. Assuming an annual per capita requirement of 400 kg of \npaddy  (equivalent  to  a  daily  per  capita  consumption  of  about  700  grams  of  rice)  and  a \nhousehold size of 7 persons, the annual household requirement is about 2,800 kg of paddy. \nWhile this amount of paddy is already produced on the lowland farm model 1, the sufficiency \nlevel is likely to vary considerably from year to year in response to weather conditions and pest \nand disease incidence. The upland farm model 2, however, only produces enough paddy for \nabout 10 months. With-project, it is envisaged that paddy production on the lowland farm model \n1 will increase to the extent that a marketable surplus will be available while paddy production \non the upland farm model 2 will increase to meet household requirements. \ne.  Economic Viability and Sensitivity Analysis \n \n19.  With the base case assumptions, the estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \nis 24.7%. The EIRR and outcome of its sensitivity analysis are summarized in Table A12.2. In \nsummary, the EIRR is sensitive to a delay in benefit flows but rather less sensitive to changes in \ninvestment costs and to price changes in the main incremental outputs. If forestry benefits are \nexcluded, the EIRR remains above 12%.

Impact on Poverty \n20.  The Project will have significant impact on poverty reduction. At least 25% of the 10,000 \npotential beneficiaries will be poor households whose non-cash income will rise, on average, in \naccess of 50%. The cash incomes will increase 5-6 fold\u2014although the relative increase seems \nhigh but in absolute terms it is still modest. All participating households will be able to produce ", "56   Appendix 12 \nenough rice to ensure food security. The actual impact on poverty will likely be more than just \nincrease in household incomes as Project supported beneficiary training will assist them in \naccumulating social capital making them aware of further opportunities to better their lives. With \nadditional disposable cash income, they will be able to afford better education and health and \neven start small businesses. Ethnic groups and women will especially benefit from this Project \ngiven the nature of activities specifically targeted to address their needs. \n \n  4.  Impact on the Environment \n \n21.  Increased cash household incomes from livestock and sustainable harvesting of NTFPs \nwill have considerable positive impact on the environment. Degraded forest, covering about \n30,000 ha, will be restored. Another, 25,000 ha will be taken out of shifting cultivation as \nparticipating households are able to increase their productivity from existing farmland. Overall, \nthe land use in these watersheds will become sustainable in the long run increasing their water \nconservation capacity considerably from current levels. \n \n  5.  Sustainability of Project Activities \n \n22.  Given the nature of investment interventions\u2014that are simple, affordable, and do not \nrequire  well-developed  input/output  markets  or  continuous  support  and  training\u2014Project \nactivities are expected to be sustainable in the long run. With appropriate support and training \nfarmers will get access to modern variety rice seed and improved farming practices. The seed of \nsame set of varieties could be multiplied within the village and shared. In the subsequent years, \nfarmers would know the value of improved seed and the know-how about where and how to \nattain it. These modern rice varieties do not require chemical inputs\u2014pesticides and fertilizers\u2014\nto grow to their desired potential. Therefore, weak input markets in the subproject areas would \nnot hamper adoption of these technologies. Due to political economy of rice production in the \nregion, farmers would have no incentive to regularly grow surplus. Therefore, once food security \nis achieved they would tend to diversify into vegetables, fruits, etc. Likewise, lessons from \nsimilar projects elsewhere in the country show that the proposed activities for livestock and \nNTFP management would be sustainable in the long run as trained farmer groups would be \nable to carry on with these activities on their on even after Project completion. \n \nD.  Conclusions \n \n23.  The financial and economic evaluation has demonstrated that the Project design is \nsound and viable. The estimated base case EIRR is 24.7%. Significant benefits expected to \narise from capacity building activities in all three components cannot be quantified. However, \ntheir impact on institutionalizing IWRM in the Government\u2019s planning and management systems \nand its resultant impact on optimal use of water resources will contribute significantly to national \neconomy  as  well  as  helping  in  materializing  the  impact  of  investment  activities.  Improved \nreservoir  management  will  result  in  significant  benefits  stemming  both  from  increased \nhydropower generation and flood mitigation. At the grassroots level, about 10,000 households, \nat least 25% of them below the poverty line, will directly benefit from Project activities. The \nincidence of shifting cultivation will be reduced and sustainable forest management practices \nintroduced.  The  Project  benefits  have  been  estimated  employing  modest  assumptions. \nTherefore, the actual impact of the Project will most likely be much greater on poverty reduction, \nsustainable environmental management, and optimal use of water resources.
