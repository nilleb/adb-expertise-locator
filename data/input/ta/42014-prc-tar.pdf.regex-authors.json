At the request of the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), a technical \nassistance (TA) for Improvement of Public Employment Service System in the Western Region \nwas included in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) 2008 nonlending program during the PRC \nCountry  Programming  Mission  undertaken  in  December  2007. 1  The  ADB  undertook  TA \nreconnaissance  in  June  2008  and  a  fact-finding  mission  in  August  2008.  Agreement  was \nreached with the Government, including the Ministry of Finance and Qinghai provincial bureaus, \non the TA\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, costs and financing, implementation arrangement, and \noutline of terms of reference for consulting services. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Dynamic  economic  growth  in  the  PRC  has  generated  nearly  3\u20135  million  additional \nworkers every year, driven by competitive integration into global markets. Rapid socioeconomic \ndevelopment has changed the profile of the PRC employment and labor market, which has \nbecome more complex.  Major challenges include an increased number of surplus labor and \nmigrant workers, strong demand for skilled labor, integration of the current urban\u2013rural dual \nsystem,2 and the provision of increased employment in the private sector. In particular, given \nlimited cultivated land per capita in the PRC and low incomes in rural areas, the reduction of \nrural surplus labor is a critical goal of the PRC\u2019s economic development policy. Increasing \nemployment opportunities in the industrial and service sectors in urban and rural areas is \nexpected to absorb rural surplus labor, maintain the low unemployment rate, and contribute to \nthe reduction of rural poverty.   \n \n3.  Since  the  late  1990s,  the  Government  has  made  significant  efforts  to  develop  a \nmodernized  public  employment  service  (PES)  system  supported  by  a  number  of  policy \ninstruments.3 The PES system has expanded nationwide, bringing together various institutions \nat a number of levels. The PES is expected to be a catalyst among job seekers, the laid-off and \nunemployed,  and  employees  and  employers  in  providing  fundamental  and  comprehensive \nservices in relation to labor security.  The PES consists of (i) providing legal advice to laborers \nabout their rights and benefits, (ii) brokering jobs, (iii) providing labor market information and \nanalysis, (iv) administering unemployment benefits, (v) providing vocational training, and (vi) \noffering special support to disadvantaged populations.   \n \n4.  One of the key roles of the PES is to promote the rational allocation of labor resources in \nthe nation. Notably, as employment opportunities have rapidly increased in the PRC, the role of \nthe PES has become even more critical.  In response to strong socioeconomic demand, as well \nas the changing environments of labor and employment in the PRC, the PES needs to be \nimproved, in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Challenges include the strengthening of \ninstitutional  arrangements,  including  increased  capacity  and  resources  at  various  levels; \neffective  implementation  and  coordination  of  decentralization  related  to  the  delegation  of \nauthorities; and development of proactive networking.  In the PRC\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u2013\n2010), the Government has explicitly stressed the need to further strengthen the management \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 July 2008. \n2  The PRC has been, for a long time, a dual society with an overt socioeconomic line drawn between the urban and \nrural sectors.  This division was introduced under the planned economy to facilitate overall public administration, \nincluding areas such as policy setting, provision of social services, and access to employment opportunities.  \n3  Regulation of Labor Market Management 2000, Employment Promotion Law 2008, Regulations on Employment \nService and Employment Management 2008. \n ", "2   \nof social programs and the functions of various public services, including the PES, in order to \nachieve the main targets set in the 11th Five-Year Plan by 2010.4 \n \n5.  The Western Region5 covers more than 70% of the PRC\u2019s area, but comprises only 28% \nof the national population. The region is characterized by a relatively small population spread \nout over large areas. The region\u2019s economy is largely engaged in rural and agricultural activities. \nDue  to  the  Government\u2019s  Western  Development  Strategy  that  was  launched  in  2000,  the \nsocioeconomic  status  of  the  region  has  gradually  improved.  Nevertheless,  there  is  still \nsignificant  economic  disparity  between  the  coastal  region  and  the  Western  Region,  and \nbetween rural and urban areas within the Western Region.   \n \n6.  Remoteness is one of the major concerns in the Western Region, where there is a lack \nof infrastructure and insufficient transportation services. The challenge is to provide a PES to \ncommunities located in remote areas, which are spread over a considerable land area. Remote \ncounties and/or districts and townships/communities rarely have a government-administered \nPES, and traveling from capital cities to remote areas is difficult. In addition, many households \nin the remote areas do not have access to electricity. The lack of a PES tends to result in poor \naccess to information, and in economic, social, and cultural isolation. \n \n7.  Over 80% of the PRC\u2019s ethnic minorities, from more than 43 ethnic groups, inhabit the \nWestern Region. Most of the ethnic minority groups are engaged in the primary sector such as \nagriculture. In addition, national statistics indicates that women have less access to employment \nopportunities and education in the region. The complexity of socioeconomic and cultural factors \nhinders the development of the region. A culturally sensitive and gender-responsive approach is \nimportant for the region\u2019s development.   \n \n8.  Qinghai province has been selected by the Government as the case study province for \nthis TA since it is considered a typical model province of the Western Region. Qinghai province \nis located in the northeast part of the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Plateau, and accounts for around 7.5% of \nthe total land of the PRC and comprises about 4.5% of the national population. The average \nelevation of Qinghai is more than 3,000 meters above sea level. Qinghai's economy is among \nthe smallest in the country, comprising about 0.3% of the PRC\u2019s economy.6 More than 48% of \nthe  province\u2019s  population  comprises  ethnic  minorities.7 The  female  illiteracy  rate,  which  is \n35.9%,8 is  much  higher  than  male  illiteracy  rate  of  15.7%.  Therefore,  women  are  at  a \ndisadvantage in accessing basic social needs. An increasing amount of surplus labor in remote \nareas requires an easily accessible and user-friendly PES to provide employment opportunities \nand ensure labor security to sustain and improve the quality of life for laborers. Considering the \nunique regional conditions, the PES for this part of the country will need to be customized to \nmeet the needs of the people. Based on the case study of Qinghai province, the TA will \nrecommend improvements to the PES for the Western Region.   \n \n                                                 \n4   (i) New jobs created for urban residents reaching 45 million in 5 years, and (ii) number of rural laborers transferred \nto non-agriculture sectors reaching 45 million in 5 years. 11th Five-Year Plan 2006\u20132010. \n5  The Western Region consists of 12 province level administrative entities; Chongqing Municipality, 6 provinces \n(Gansu,  Guizhou,  Qinghai,  Shaanxi,  Sichuan,  and  Yunnan);  and  5  autonomous  regions  (Guangxi  Zhuang \nAutonomous Region (AR), Inner Mongolia AR, Ningxia Hui AR, Tibet AR, and Xinjiang Uygur AR). \n6  2008.

The TA is directly linked to ADB\u2019s Country Partnership Strategy (2008\u20132010),9 which \nplaces emphasis on inclusive growth and balanced development. The TA will also adhere to the \nkey interventions of ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) and ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender \nand Development (2003) in promoting equality, not only as a fundamental human right, but also \nas essential to poverty reduction, improved living standards, and sustainable economic growth.  \nIn addition, the TA will build on the lessons learned from other TAs that ADB has recently \nsupported.10These  TAs  have  prepared  draft  final  reports,  in  which  similar  challenges  and \nopportunities were identified in case study provinces.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA is improved PES in the Western Region of the PRC. The outcome \nof the TA is the increased use of improved PES by disadvantaged people in the Western \nRegion including women, ethnic minorities, and those who live in remote areas.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  In order to produce the expected outcome, two technical reports will be developed based \non  an  in-depth  field  survey  that  uses  quantitative  and  qualitative  approaches.    First, \norganizational  issues  of  the  PES  will  be  reviewed  and  analyzed  in  the  context  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  current  decentralized  mechanism,  in  terms  of  resource  allocation  and \nmobilization, and the capacity of each public institution at four levels (province, prefecture, \ncounty and township).  Given the national decentralization policy and delegation of authorities to \ninstitutions at each administrative level, an optimal model will be suggested, using existing \nresources, to make the PES available to disadvantaged people in remote areas.  Second, the \nPES will be reviewed and analyzed to develop a demand-based and user-friendly system.  One \nof TA\u2019s key activities will be to evaluate the pilot version of the web-based information service, \nQinghai Labor Market Info Net,11 to improve its usefulness. Users of the PES will include, \namong others, urban and rural people, job seekers, state and private enterprises, and schools. \nSupporting  the  Government\u2019s  pro-poor  policies,  the  TA  will  promote  the  PES  to  the \ndisadvantaged population such as women, ethnic minorities, the unemployed, and those who \nlive in remote areas. In addition, based on the two technical reports, a comprehensive and \nfocused policy note with recommendations will be developed. The note and recommendations \nwill be a knowledge product of this TA and will be widely disseminated to policy makers at the \ncentral and provincial levels. \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented in three phases over a 10-month period. Phase 1, lasting \none month, will comprise studies to (i) review policies, strategies, and the PES system at four \nlevels  (province,  prefecture,  county  and  township)  in  Qinghai;  (ii)  identify  challenges  and \nopportunities to improve the PES, especially for the disadvantaged population including women, \nethnic minorities, the unemployed, and those who live in remote areas; and (iii) develop an \ninception report with draft outlines of the two technical reports, and a policy note. \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2008.

Phase 2, lasting for four months, will (i) review existing data, identify new data to be \ncollected from the survey, which will include qualitative data, and assess current provincial \nefforts to promote the PES, including Qinghai Labor Market Info Net (footnote 11), to determine \nwhat is effective and what is less effective; (ii) formulate the design of a field survey, including \ndevelopment of quantitative and qualitative tools; (iii) conduct training(s) for the researchers on \nqualitative research methods; and (iv) conduct the field survey. In addition, an international \nstudy tour on PES best practices, with a focus on disadvantaged populations, will be planned \nand organized. Observations of international practices and recommendations will be reflected in \nthe midterm review report, which will be conducted at the end of phase 2. \n \n14.  Phase 3, lasting for five months, will (i) organize a series of stakeholder consultations in  \nthe province to verify the outcome of the field survey and develop the two technical reports and \nnote with policy recommendations; (ii) recommend an effective, demand-based, user-friendly \nand operational PES system, which will strengthen interventions for improvement of the PES \nand  serve  the  people  of  Qinghai,  including  the  disadvantaged  population,  such  as  ethnic \nminorities, women, the unemployed, and those who live in remote areas; (iii) finalize the two \ntechnical reports and policy note to be disseminated to the Western Region; and (iv) organize a \nfinal review workshop and a final workshop to present the key findings of the TA. \n \n15.  This TA is deemed appropriate for applying qualitative research methods, together with \nquantitative  methods,  from  the  design  stage  to  production  of  the  final  results.  Qualitative \nresearch methods are considered effective to deal with the disadvantaged population\u2014such as \nthe  rural  poor,  women,  and  ethnic  minorities\u2014in  untangling  and  addressing  their  subtle \ndifferences with the wider community with respect to attitudes, values, and expectations. The \nPES will deal directly with people who have different backgrounds and the collected data will be \nused to develop a demand-based and user-friendly PES.  In combination with quantitative data \nand the outcome of qualitative research with in-depth analysis, the TA will present sound \nrecommendations for developing the PES in the Western Region. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $500,000 equivalent. ADB will finance \n$400,000 on a grant basis from its TA funding program. The Government will provide the \nbalance of local costs, equivalent to $100,000, to cover the TA office and equipment (e.g. \ncomputers), office communications, and remuneration and per diem for counterpart staff.  The \ndetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  Qinghai Provincial Finance Bureau will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the TA, and will \nbe responsible for the overall execution and coordination of TA activities. Qinghai Provincial \nBureau of Labor and Social Security will be the Implementing Agency (IA) and carry-out all \nproject  activities  in  close  cooperation  with  the  consultants.  The  IA  has  assigned  seven \ncounterpart staff to assist the TA and work closely with the consultants to ensure the outcome of \nthe TA realistically conforms to the local situation.12 In addition, the EA will establish an inter-\nministerial project steering committee to provide overall guidance and support to the proposed \nTA. The steering committee will be chaired by the deputy governor of Qinghai province. \n                                                 \n12  No. 26 of 2008 Official Decision issued by Qinghai Provincial Bureau of Labor and Social Security (27 March \n2008).  \n ", "  5\n18.  The TA will be implemented over a 10-month period and is expected to start in March \n2009 and be completed by December 2009.  A total of 27 person-months of consulting services \n(one international and five national consultants) will be required. The TA consultants will be \nengaged through a firm in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time) and based on the quality of the proposal (90%) and the cost \n(10%) of the services to be provided (under the quality- and cost-based selection method), \nusing a simplified technical proposal. The 90:10 weighting is considered appropriate because it \nis expected that the TA will have a strong impact on the development of future policies on the \nPES in the Western Region, and therefore requires high-quality technical inputs. The terms of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 3. An advance payment facility will be established \nunder the TA. \n \n19.  All reports by the consultants will be prepared in English and translated into Chinese. \nTranslation costs for project reports will be budgeted and allocated to the consultants. The \nconsultants will maintain close working relations with ADB, the EA, and, in particular, the IA; and \nwill regularly discuss project progress and findings. Meetings involving the ADB task manager, \nconsultants, and EA and IA officials will be held to provide guidance to the consultants and to \nreview their reports. \n \n20.  The  EA  will  provide  a  suitably  furnished  office  with  computers,  utilities,  and \ntelecommunication access (broadband internet connection), intercity transport for consultants, \nmaterials, maps, data, and documents as required under the TA; and will cover the cost of office \nutilities for the consultants.   \n \n21.  Dissemination of the results will be key to the success of the project. A policy note will \nbecome  a  knowledge  product  of  this  TA.  The  final  workshop  will  present  the  TA\u2019s  key \nrecommendations to officials from selected provinces in the Western Region and ministries at \nthe central level. The outputs of the TA will be presented in a downloadable form on the Qinghai \nLabor Market Info Net, and their dissemination through the media will be planned. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Improvement of Public Employment \nService System in the Western Region, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND
