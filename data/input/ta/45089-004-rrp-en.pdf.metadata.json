THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed results-\nbased loan to the Republic of the Philippines for the Secondary Education Support Program. \n \n2.  The  program  will  continue  support  for  implementation  of  system-wide  secondary \neducation reforms during 2019\u20132023 as part of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) support to \nthe  Government  of  the  Philippines\u2019  Kindergarten  to  Grade  12  Basic  Education  Program \n(K to 12 Program).1 The program builds on and complements ADB\u2019s ongoing Senior High School \nSupport Program2 and will improve secondary level student learning outcomes and completion \nrates by (i) strengthening secondary education curriculum and assessment; (ii) improving the \nquality and relevance of technical-vocational-livelihood (TVL) education in secondary schools; (iii) \nimproving the quality of teachers in secondary education; (iv) strengthening the secondary \neducation financing system; and (v) strengthening school-based management in secondary \neducation.3  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  The  Philippines  has  experienced  unprecedented  economic  expansion,  with  gross \ndomestic product growth averaging 6.6% in 2011\u20132016. To maintain this growth, structural \nchanges in the local economy and rapid technological changes in the global economy must be \nmet with a workforce equipped with an appropriate set of advanced skills and knowledge. The \ngovernment recognizes that human capital development is crucial for enhancing competitiveness, \nsustaining  growth,  and  promoting  inclusion.  The  Philippine  Development  Plan,  2017\u20132022 \nemphasizes equalizing human development opportunities by improving access to quality basic \nand tertiary education, particularly for the poor.4 The overarching strategic framework for basic \neducation calls for (i) the full implementation of the K to 12 Program, (ii) continuing curriculum \nreforms, (iii) enhancing teacher competency, (iv) developing and improving interventions to keep \nstudents in school, and (v) strengthening inclusion programs.5 \n \n4.  The K to 12 Program, introduced in 2013, aims to equip youth with foundational and life \nskills to prepare them for tertiary education and employment. The K to 12 Program\u2019s secondary \neducation component includes an additional 2-year senior high school (SHS) level; a curriculum \nto  meet  21st  century  skills  requirements,  including  problem  solving  and  information  and \ncommunication technology; a TVL track for job-ready skills; and expanded use of public\u2013private \npartnerships in education financing, including the junior high school (JHS) Educational Service \nContracting (ESC) and the SHS voucher program.6 \n                                                \n1  The K to 12 Program covers kindergarten, primary (grades 1\u20136), and secondary education. Secondary education \ncomprises four years of junior high school (grades 7\u201310) and two years of senior high school (grades 11\u201312). \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2014.

The SHS voucher program is for JHS completers who opt to study SHS in a non-Department \n ", "2 \n \n   \n5.  Despite the gains in enrollment and completion compared with 1990 levels, the country\u2019s \nsecondary education system continues to face access challenges. In school year (SY) 2015/16, \nthe JHS net enrollment rate was only 68% and the completion rate was 74%. In the same school \nyear, only six out of 10 children of secondary school age belonging to the poorest 20% of \nhouseholds were in JHS, compared with nine in the richest 20%. Only 15% of secondary school \nage children from the poorest 20% of households were in SHS compared with 52% from the \nrichest quintile.7 Girls continue to outperform boys in most JHS indicators based on SY2015/16 \nsex-disaggregated data: net enrollment rate (female: 79.9%, male: 68.8%), completion rate \n(female: 78.5%, male: 69.7%), and dropout rate (female: 6.5%, male: 6.6%).  In addition, more \nneeds to be done to improve students\u2019 learning outcomes. In SY 2014/15, less than half of the \nstudents obtained a mean percentage score (MPS) greater than 50% in the National Achievement \nTest (NAT).8   \n \n6.  The  government  has  identified  the  next  set  of  development  constraints.    Subject \nspecialists and SHS teachers have noted (i) difficulties in completing the new SHS curriculum \nwithin the allocated instructional time, reflecting the need to review its scope and sequence, and \n(ii) poor alignment with community and industry needs. For example, many Department of \nEducation  (DepEd)  secondary  schools  offer  TVL  specializations  that  are  not  necessarily \nresponsive to local industry requirements or students\u2019 preferences. Moreover, the shortage of \nlicensed guidance counselors has reduced schools\u2019 ability to provide good career guidance. \nDepEd\u2019s Alternative Learning System (ALS) Program has been addressing the learning needs of \nout of school youth. With the adoption of a new K to 12 curriculum, the rollout of a K to 12 \ncompliant ALS curriculum needs to be accelerated.  \n  \n7.  In addition, teacher quality needs to improve. Many secondary schools do not have \nenough specialized teachers in core subjects because of difficulties in recruiting and deploying \nsubject specialists. The shortage of specialized teachers and the challenge of retaining them in \nthe system partly result from the absence of a clear teacher career pathway and inadequate \nprofessional development opportunities to address training needs. Key priorities to improve \nteacher quality include: (i) alignment of both pre-service education and in-service training with the \nK to 12 curriculum and the Philippine Professional Standards for Teachers; (ii) improving the \nmatching of teacher specialization with subject taught; and (iii) developing a more responsive \nteacher career pathing policy, including an increase in the number of master teacher9 positions.  \n \n8.  While budget allocation for basic education has increased significantly following recent \neducation reforms, the DepEd\u2019s utilization of its budget has only started to improve and needed \nincreases in specific budget items remain. The school maintenance and other operating expenses \nbudget increased by more than 50% during 2011\u20132015, but this has been inadequate to meet \nspecific needs at both JHS and SHS levels. These shortages are exacerbated by DepEd\u2019s chronic \nunderutilization of its budget. Inadequate equipment, tools, and learning materials limit the ability \n                                                \nof Education (DepEd) SHS (i.e., private schools or state and local university and college). The assistance defrays \n(either partly or in full) the school fees charged by the non-DepEd SHS provider. \n7  Philippine Statistics Authority. 2016. Annual Poverty Indicators Survey. Manila. \n8  The students\u2019 performance progress and least mastered competencies could not be ascertained in SY2015/16 and \nSY2016/17 since the NAT was not administered due to procurement issues in the printing of the test instruments.  \n9  Master teacher refers to teaching positions in the DepEd system whose qualification standards for teachers in the \nacademic track and core subjects include (i) at least a master\u2019s degree in the relevant strand or subject, (ii) at least \n4 years of relevant teaching or industry experience, and (iii) at least 8 hours of training relevant to the subject area \nspecialization. \n ", "3 \nof teachers (and students) to teach (and learn) specialized subjects. This is partly caused by \ndelays in the centralized procurement of these critical inputs. The JHS ESC and SHS voucher \nprograms provide increased options to male and female students to choose their secondary \nschool.  However,  the  subsidy  programs\u2019  effectiveness,  cost,  equity  of  access,  and  quality \nassurance processes need careful examination to maximize positive outcomes. Finally, two \ndecades of school-based management (SBM) implementation in the country show that key \nstakeholders need to be actively involved to continuously improve student learning outcomes.10 \nThe establishment of school governance councils could provide a strong mechanism to foster \ncommunity engagement and strategic partnerships. The previous system of assessing the SBM \npractice of each school needs to be invigorated, given its important link to improving schools and \nstudent learning outcomes. \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n9.  The program will complement ADB\u2019s ongoing SHS Support Program (footnote 2) by \nsupporting reforms at the JHS level and addressing emerging issues in SHS. The program aligns \nwith ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the Philippines 2018\u20132023, which supports improved \naccess to quality secondary education.11 It will complement ADB support to the conditional cash \ntransfer program, which provides education grants to secondary school children belonging to poor \nfamilies; and the JobStart Philippines Program, which focuses on getting youth from education to \nemployment.12 The program is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (Table 1).13 \n \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030 Priorities  Secondary Education Support Program \n1. Addressing remaining poverty and  (i) Improve employment opportunities and incomes of secondary education \nreducing inequalities  graduates; (ii) raise secondary level completion rates of those who would \notherwise not have completed high school and who are likely to be from poorer \nhouseholds; (iii) address the learning needs and unique circumstances of the \nout-of-school youth through the Alternative Learning System program. \n2. Accelerating progress in gender  Improve gender equality through actions that are gender-sensitive and \nequality  responsive to the needs of female and male learners. This includes (i) \nintegrating gender in the secondary education curriculum and in the analysis of \ntest results, (ii) deploying qualified male and female master teachers, and \n(iii) mobilizing female and male career advocates in secondary schools. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n10.  Performance of current results-based lending program. The SHS Support Program \nincreased whole-of-government support and resources to achieve results and implement the \nreforms and innovations embedded in the results indicators. The SHS Support Program also \nsupported the establishment and smooth rollout of the SHS level, starting with the development \nof the SHS curriculum. The SHS Support Program supported key results including the hiring of \n47,000  science  and math teachers,  which  allowed  DepEd  to  achieve  its  minimum  service \nstandard for the number of qualified teachers per student in DepEd SHSs. The SHS Support \nProgram was instrumental in the development and effective implementation of the SHS voucher \n                                                \n10  F. Yamauchi. 2014.

Strong government ownership of \nthe results has ensured continued commitment despite leadership changes. Technical assistance \n(TA) provided by ADB improved DepEd\u2019s capacity to rigorously monitor the implementation of the \noverall SHS Support Program.14  \n \n11.  Lessons learned.  ADB has applied lessons learned from the SHS Support Program \nengagement in designing the proposed program. First, there should be strong commitment and \nsupport  at  all  levels  of  the  executing  agency  to  achieve  the  results  and  sustain  reform \nimplementation. Second, there is a need to provide TA to strengthen government systems and \nsupport  the  achievement  of  the  agreed results. Third,  the  use  of  an  interagency  program \ncoordination  committee  improves  implementation  and  addresses  operational  bottlenecks. \nBuilding on these lessons, program preparation involved extensive consultation with DepEd and \nother stakeholders to align with government priorities, capacity, resources, and commitment. \n  \n12.  Program modality.  Based on the experience and successes  of the SHS Support \nProgram, the use of the results-based lending (RBL) modality was selected for the proposed \nprogram. The government\u2019s secondary education reform agenda, which the program will support, \nis extensive\u2014covering 8,751 DepEd schools, 5,210 private schools, 293,086 public school \nteachers, 223 schools divisions, 17 regions, and 10.6 million learners. The RBL modality is \nappropriate to support the government\u2019s reform agenda because it focuses on critical results and \nsystem reforms, rather than specific transactions and expenditures as in the case of the project \nmodality. The RBL modality will leverage resources to advance key systemic and policy reforms \nand  catalyze  increased  government  and  development  partner  resources  to  support  the \nachievement of the program results. Given that the program\u2019s systems are applied, and reforms \nare implemented by government staff, the RBL modality will strengthen internal systems, enhance \nsustainability, and institutionalize good practices and initiatives. \n \n13.  ADB value addition. ADB\u2019s pioneering support for Philippine\u2019s secondary education \nhelped achieve key reforms, including the recent transition to a K to 12 basic education cycle. \nADB has provided direct support to the DepEd in the design and implementation of the ALS and \nthe SHS voucher program and will continue to mobilize support to improve the programs\u2019 \neffectiveness. Reforms on teacher development, curriculum development, student assessment, \nand technical-vocational education will be supported, given ADB\u2019s extensive engagement and \nexperience  in  implementing  similar  reforms  in  several  Asian  countries.    Financing  and \nengagement  from  the  private  sector  and  key  partners  will  be  leveraged  by  improving \nimplementation of the TVL track and SBM. Institutional and capacity development on financial \nmanagement (FM), procurement, and career guidance will be provided through ADB TA support \n(footnote 3). \n \nC.  Program Scope \n \n14.  The program will support the development and implementation of reforms under the \ngovernment\u2019s secondary education program from 2019 to 2023. Following the RBL policy, the \nprogram will not include high-value procurement contracts and packages.15 \n \n \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2015.

Program Results \n \n15.  The  program\u2019s  impact  will  be  equalized  opportunities  for  human  development.  The \noutcome will be improved secondary level student learning outcomes and completion rates.  The \nprogram will primarily benefit current and future students who will gain increased access to a \nhigher quality and more relevant secondary education that is aligned to 21st century labor market \nneeds. Teachers will also benefit from the increased professional development opportunities and \na clear career advancement pathway. Of the six disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs), DLI 1 will \nassess the achievement of the outcome by the improved performance of students in the NAT and \nin the SHS TVL national competency assessment. The rest of the DLIs are grouped into three \nprogram outputs and described in paras. 16\u201318. The DLIs are summarized in Table 3 and \nAppendix 3, Table A3.1.16  \n \n16.  Output 1: Quality and relevance of the secondary education program improved. This \noutput will strengthen the secondary education curriculum and assessment system, which is \nexpected to equip approximately 10.6 million learners currently in the system, and an additional \n2 million grade 7 entrants each year during 2019-2023 with essential competencies for lifelong \nlearning and employability. To address the learning needs of some 2.5 million out-of-school youth \nwho are not able to attend SHS formal education, the SHS-level ALS curriculum will be aligned \nwith the K to 12 curriculum (DLI 2, program action plan [PAP] 1.1)17 and pilot tested in a few areas \n(DLI 2). The scope and sequence of the math, science, and English curriculum guides will be \nreviewed and revised to make them responsive to learners\u2019 needs, the labor market, and issues \naffecting youth (e.g., teenage pregnancy, substance abuse) (DLI 2). Grades 10 and 12 summative \ntests will be strengthened, and the results disseminated and analyzed (including from a gender \nperspective) to drive teaching and learning improvements. The DepEd schools division office staff \n                                                \n16 A detailed description of the DLI indicators and the corresponding verification protocols are in Appendix 3. \n17 Program Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "6 \n \nwill be trained to analyze the test results to initiate needed adjustments in the teaching process \n(DLI 2, PAP 1.5). The TVL specializations offered in DepEd schools will be reviewed to align with \nstudent preferences, community needs, industry requirements, and labor market demand (DLI 3, \nPAP1.3). A tracking system will be developed to measure the national competency passing rate \nof TVL students (DLI 3). \n \n17.  Output  2:  Quality  of  secondary  education  teachers  improved.  Recognizing  the \nimportance of teacher quality in engendering better learning outcomes, this output will support \nmeasures to enhance teacher motivation, increase teacher proficiency through professional \ndevelopment  and  career  advancement  opportunities,  and  increase the  number  of qualified \nteachers.  A  policy  which  establishes  career  paths for teachers  will  be  adopted to  provide \nincentives that will attract qualified male and female candidates into teaching, retain qualified \nteachers, and improve the link between teachers\u2019 professional development needs and training \nprograms (DLI 4). Vacant master teacher positions will be filled in line with the teachers\u2019 career \npath requirements (DLI 4, PAP 2.3), and more teachers will be hired to meet the minimum service \nstandards for teacher\u2013student ratios in math, science, and Filipino (DLI 4). A comprehensive \nprofessional  development  program  will  be  developed  and  implemented  to  improve teacher \nproficiencies in line with the teacher professional standards (DLI 4). The current 293,086 public \nsecondary education teachers and additional teachers who will be hired during 2019-2023 will \nbenefit from the improved teaching practice, content knowledge and quality of instruction, which \nwill ultimately redound to improved student learning outcomes. \n \n18.  Output  3:  Secondary  education  sector  management  strengthened.  To  support \nDepEd\u2019s financial management reforms, institutional arrangements, including the establishment \nof the DepEd financial management reform committee, will be implemented (DLI 5, PAP 3.1). The \nprogram will ensure that schools receive their maintenance and other operating expenses budget \non time (DLI 5, PAP 3.3). The budget for tools, equipment, and school furniture will be released \nto schools division offices to facilitate timely procurement and delivery to schools (DLI 5, PAP \n3.4). The program will assess the effectiveness of subsidy programs (ESC and voucher program), \nand improvements will be adopted to improve implementation of these programs (DLI 5). Output \n3 will also support measures to strengthen SBM to empower schools and their key partners to \ntake a more active role in improving student learning outcomes and alignment to labor market \ndemands. School governance councils (with gender-balanced representation among parents, \nstudents, and teachers) will be established (DLI 6, PAP 3.9). The SBM assessment framework \nwill  be  revised  to  strengthen  stakeholder  engagement  and  accountability  and  promote  a \nconducive and safe learning environment (DLI 6, PAP 3.12). The financial management and SBM \nreforms  are  expected to  improve  spending  efficiency,  reduce  bottlenecks  especially  at  the \nfinancing level, and ensure better-informed school plans and actions. The reforms will benefit \n8,751 public secondary schools and 223 schools division offices, while improvements in the \nsubsidy programs will benefit close to 1 million students and 5,210 private schools. \n \nTable 3: Disbursement-Linked Indicators  \nDisbursement  Share of Total \nAllocated  ADB \nIndicator  ($ million)  Financing (%) \nOutcome   \nDLI 1   Learning outcomes for male and female secondary education students  40.0  13.33 \nimproved \nOutputs   \nDLI 2   Secondary education curriculum and assessment strengthened  60.0  20.00 \nDLI 3   Quality and relevance of TVL education in secondary schools improved  32.5  10.84 \nDLI 4   Quality of teachers in secondary education improved  65.0  21.67 \nDLI 5   Secondary education financing system strengthened  62.5  20.83 ", "7 \nDLI 6   School-based management in secondary schools strengthened  40.0  13.33 \nTotal  300.0  100.00 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DLI = disbursement-linked indicator, TVL = technical-vocational-livelihood. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n19.

The  government  will  finance  $23,777.4  million  (98.8%)  of  the \n$24,077.4  million  cost  of  implementing  the  program.  To  address  government\u2019s  financing \nrequirements, and to support DLI achievement, advance financing of up to 25% of the total loan \namount can be provided. Financing of prior results achieved not more than 12 months before loan \nsigning will be allowed (up to 20% of the total loan amount). However, disbursements can only be \nmade once the program is effective. The combined outstanding balance of advance financing and \nfinancing for prior results cannot exceed 30% of the total loan amount. \n \n22.  The government has requested a regular loan of $300,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the annuity method \nwith 10% discount factor, the average maturity is 18.31 years and the maturity premium payable \nto ADB is 0.20% per year. \n \n23.

", "8 \n \n \n24.  Disbursement arrangements. Except for advance financing, which will be based on the \nachievement  of  future  DLIs,  ADB  disbursement  will  be  made  following  achievement  and \nverification of DLIs (Appendix 3). Disbursements will be allowed for early or late achievement of \nDLIs. Partial disbursements will be allowed for some DLIs. Disbursements will not depend on \nevidence  of  expenditure  or  transactions.  The  government  will  ensure  that  total  program \nexpenditures are equal to, or exceed, the total amount of the loan withdrawn.  Before the \ndisbursement of loan proceeds, the Department of Finance will submit a withdrawal application, \nalong with evidence verifying DLI achievement in accordance with the verification protocol. In \ncase advance financing was utilized, the government will refund any outstanding advance within \n6 months of program completion if DLIs are not achieved by program completion. The loan \nproceeds will be disbursed to an account specified by the government. \n \nF.  Capacity Development and Program Action Plan \n \n25.  The PAP will support capacity development in program areas, including review of the \ncurriculum,  education  assessment,  collection  of  sex-disaggregated  data  to  assess  student \nlearning, teacher proficiency, gender analysis, and SBM. It will also support the implementation \nof DepEd\u2019s financial management and procurement reforms. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n26.  DepEd will be the executing agency and will implement the program through its central, \nregional, schools division offices, and secondary schools. DepEd\u2019s Executive Committee will \nserve as the program steering committee and will set strategic directions and provide overall \noperational guidance.18 A program implementation and coordination committee, composed of \nDepEd  implementing  units,  will  coordinate  implementation  of  DLI  and  PAP,  and  address \noperational bottlenecks. An expanded program implementation and coordination committee will \ninclude key officials from the Departments of Finance and Budget and Management, and the \nNational Economic and Development Authority; and will discuss key implementation requirements \nthat need their support or intervention. \n \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n27.  The DLIs and PAP, which have been selected, prioritized, and vetted through a rigorous \nconsultation process with government, directly respond to key secondary education issues and \nchallenges. The results and planned actions are designed to improve learning outcomes and will \ncontribute directly to the secondary education graduates\u2019 increased productivity, employability, \nand  readiness  to  pursue  further  education.  The  DLIs  and  PAP  are  underpinned  by  the \ngovernment\u2019s reform agenda and priorities in secondary education. These are based on extensive \nanalyses  undertaken  by  ADB  and  the  government.  The  targeted  results  are  likely  to  be \nsustainable in the medium-term since they will increase spending efficiency and gain strong \nstakeholder support once in place. Overall, the program has sound design and implementation \narrangements,  and  a  well-designed  results  framework.  The  DLIs  are  critical  indicators  for \nachieving the program results. \n \n                                                \n18 The secretary of education chairs the Executive Committee, and all undersecretaries and assistant secretaries are \nmembers. ", "9 \n28.  As part of the government\u2019s secondary education program, the program will improve \nemployment  opportunities  and  incomes  of  graduates  in  two  ways:  (i)  by  equipping  them, \nespecially those taking the TVL track, with sufficient competencies to qualify them for good-\nquality, higher-paying jobs even if they do not intend to pursue further studies; and (ii) by preparing \nthem to pursue higher education. This means that the program will contribute to raising their \nincomes closer to levels earned by post-secondary technical-vocational graduates (about 30% \nhigher, on average, based on data from the Labor Force Survey), and even higher (about 86%) if \nthey are able to complete college.19 \n \n29. The poor, who are mainly enrolled in DepEd schools or its nonformal education program, \nwill have greater access to better and more affordable education because of the proposed \nprogram. They will also have better opportunities to pursue post-secondary education and training \nor improve their chances of getting better jobs and raising their incomes. The program will \nencourage the poor, who would otherwise not have completed high school, to complete high \nschool. These outcomes can be attributed to the improved quality of secondary education. \n30.  The program is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. It aims to achieve gender \nequality results through actions that are gender-sensitive and responsive to the needs of female \nand male learners. The following key gender elements and actions are embedded in the DLIs: (i) \nintegration of gender perspective in the analysis of NAT results; (ii) youth-relevant issues such as \nsubstance abuse, sexual and reproductive health, and teenage pregnancy, adequately addressed \nthrough curriculum revision; (iii) having two teachers (preferably one female and one male) in \neach secondary school trained, certified, and designated as  career advocates  to provide career \nguidance to students free of gender bias and stereotypes ; and (iv) monitoring the progress and \nperformance of a conducive and safe learning environment (free of gender-based discrimination \nand violence, and bullying), and making this an integral part of the SBM assessment framework. \n \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n31.  Monitoring and evaluation system. DepEd\u2019s existing monitoring and evaluation systems \nare robust and will allow timely reporting and monitoring of implementation and results. However, \nfurther improvements are required, including establishing protocols to regularize data collection \n(e.g., passing rates of completers in the national competency assessment), encoding the data \ninto the enhanced basic education information system, and improving the link between the learner \ninformation  system  and  the  ESC  and  voucher  monitoring  systems.  DepEd\u2019s  program \nmanagement service will be responsible for consolidating reports from DepEd\u2019s implementing \nunits and ensuring the timely submission of progress reports to ADB and DepEd. \n \n32.  Fiduciary systems. The FM assessment of DepEd concluded that overall pre-mitigation \nFM risk is substantial. DepEd\u2019s FM has improved from 2014 to 2017, but some weaknesses \nremain, such as the limited number and weak capacity of internal audit staff. An action plan to \naddress these issues has been formulated with DepEd (PAP 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.6, and 3.7). A \nprocurement capacity assessment of DepEd indicates that its procurement system has the \ninstitutional arrangements to implement reforms, but it also has key challenges. Procurement \nplanning and compliance monitoring are weak. This causes delays in procurement and delivery \nof critical inputs to end-users. Risk mitigating measures include capacity building of field-level \nstaff on procurement planning and hiring additional qualified staff to handle major procurement \nactivities. \n                                                \n19 Government  of  the  Philippines,  Philippine  Statistical  Authority.  2017.

The Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities \nin Results-Based Lending for Programs were explained to and discussed with the government \nand DepEd.20 \n \n34.  Safeguard  systems.  The  program  is  categorized  C  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples. Therefore, no program safeguards system assessment \nwas undertaken. No construction or renovation activities will occur, and no land acquisition or \nrestriction of land use will trigger any of ADB\u2019s safeguards policy principles. Indigenous peoples \ncommunities will not be specifically targeted. No differential impacts are expected. \n \nC.  Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n \n35.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  described  in  detail  in  the  integrated  risk \nassessment and mitigating measures.21 Risks include (i) unanticipated economic slowdown which \nreduces school participation rates and government\u2019s fiscal capacity to provide services; (ii) \nchange in government leadership, leading to a change of priorities and weakened support to \nreforms  embedded  in  the  program\u2019s  results  framework;  (iii)  insufficient  funding  for  proper \nimplementation of the SHS TVL track, which requires substantial investment in equipment and \nlaboratories; (iv) limited number and weak capacity of DepEd\u2019s internal audit service staff; and (v) \nweak procurement capacity at central and subnational levels, leading to delays in procurement of \ncritical inputs. Risk mitigating measures include (i) integrating efficiency and cost-effectiveness \nmeasures in FM reforms; (ii) broadening support by mobilizing multi-stakeholder engagement at \nnational and local levels; (iii) ensuring full implementation of the basic education medium-term \nexpenditure plan, 2019\u20132023, which includes the TVL track; (iv) strengthening audit procedures \nand training DepEd\u2019s internal audit staff; and (v) conducting procurement training of Bids and \nAwards Committee and procurement staff, with a focus on procurement planning. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n36.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the RBL program, which \nare set forth in the loan agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed results-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan of $300,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for the Secondary Education Support \nProgram, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the \nBoard. \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n24 April 2019 \n                                                \n20 ADB. 2013.
