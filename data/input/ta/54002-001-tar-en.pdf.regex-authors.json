THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \nA.  Justification \n1.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will provide project preparation and \nimplementation support, capacity building and policy advice to a series of ensuing and ongoing \nprojects in the agriculture, natural resources and rural development (ANR) sector in developing \nmember countries (DMCs) in Southeast Asia in line with the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 during 2020\u20132025. The ANR sector plays a key role in ensuring inclusive economic \ngrowth in the region and has high priority in the respective national development strategies. The \nTA facility will enhance efficiency in project preparation by (i) reducing TA processing time; and \n(ii) streamlining consultant recruitment by engaging prequalified consultants. This TA facility is \nlisted in the respective DMC country operations business plan.1 \n \n1.  Background \n2.  Remarkable economic growth and poverty reduction. The Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) region, comprising 10 Southeast Asian countries, is home to over 622 \nmillion people. It has the third largest labor force in the world, behind only the People\u2019s Republic \nof China and India. With an average annual economic growth of 5.3% during 2007\u20132018, ASEAN \nhas consistently outperformed global economic growth. ASEAN\u2019s combined gross domestic \nproducts in 2017 stood at $2.8 trillion (sixth largest economy in the world).2 The robust economic \nperformance enabled the region to reduce the proportion of populations below the respective \nnational poverty lines from 31% in 1990 to 14% in 2015 (footnote 2). The economic growth and \npoverty reduction achievements, however, are at risk due to the spread of the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic. Any health or climate induced shocks negatively impact the entire food \nsupply chain, from production all the way to consumers. Mitigating these shocks and building a \ndiverse, competitive, safe and sustainable agricultural sector will be a major objective for DMCs. \n \n3.  Increasing rural-urban income disparity. Despite the remarkable poverty reduction, \nthere are still 36 million people in the region living below the international poverty line.3 The \neconomic growth driven by industrial and service sectors centered in urban areas has left the \nlarge population in rural areas outside the stream of viable economic opportunities. The widening \nrural-urban income disparity within countries has been recognized as a common symptom.4 \nInvesting in urban development is not sufficient to make economic growth equitable, inclusive and \nsustainable. Vitalizing rural economies is imperative as the region is endowed with rich agricultural \nand natural resources, and with large populations engaged in agriculture. \n \n2.  Sector Challenges \n4.  Low rural labor productivity. The increasing rural-urban income disparity is largely \nattributable to low rural labor productivity. The DMCs have substantial rural populations, whose \nshares in total populations vary from the lowest in Indonesia (46.3%) to the highest in Cambodia \n(79.3%). Rural labor opportunities in the region are largely in rice-dominant, small-scale, and low \n \n1  ADB. 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: Cambodia, 2020\u20132022. Manila; ADB. 2019.

It is crucial for the DMCs to generate productive economic opportunities for \nrural populations by diversifying the sector and building backward and forward linkages within the \nsector. Building a skilled domestic labor force also reduces the dependency on outside labor \nmigration and strengthens the country to labor supply shocks. At the same time, current gender \nimbalances must be addressed. In most Southeast Asian countries, agriculture still accounts for \nover half of all women\u2019s employment. However, women or female headed households are \nestimated to receive less agriculture extension services than their male counterparts, have less \nland and limited access to farm equipment, tools, and communications services. \n \n5.  Increasing demand for a wide variety of safe food. Due to increased income and \nawareness for a safe and balanced diet, the people in the region demand a variety of high quality \nand more nutritious food products. Overall, incidence of malnutrition remains relatively high, \ndisproportionately affecting women and children. Because food products are produced and \ntransported by multiple players in the food value chains, it is more difficult to trace causes of food \nadulteration and contamination. Furthermore, there needs to be an effort to improve health, safety, \nand trade in livestock and livestock products by establishing transboundary animal disease control \nzones and strengthening livestock value chains. While food safety laws have become more \nstringent in the DMCs, their capacity to enforce food safety laws is still limited. The extended food \nvalue chains and wide variety of food products have made law enforcement on food safety control \na challenge.  \n \n6.  Underdeveloped agro-based value chains. To achieve inclusive growth in the region, \nthe ANR sector needs to become more competitive and generate productive off- and non-farm \njobs. Agro-based value chain development is the key to realize this. However, value chains of \nmost agriculture products in the DMCs are underdeveloped because of insufficient private sector \ninvestment caused by various constraints: (i) underdeveloped infrastructure; (ii) limited access to \nlong-term affordable finance for a great majority of business entities in the sector (i.e., micro-, \nsmall- and medium-sized enterprises and cooperatives); and (iii) sourcing raw materials from \nmany scattered small farmers. \n \n7.  Low irrigation efficiency. Low productivity and yield are also often affected by low \nirrigation coverage and efficiency. Frequently, areas do not receive sufficient irrigation water due \nto dysfunctional and aging infrastructure, resulting in considerable loss of opportunities for \nincreased productivity. Many canal networks and structures have high water losses and poor \noperational  efficiency  due  to  inappropriate  designs,  improper  planning,  non-adoption  of \nappropriate technologies, inadequate operation and maintenance, and aging. \n \n8.  Natural resources degradation and environmental pollution. The region is endowed \nwith rich natural resources, which are pivotal in sustaining a wide range of economic activities \nand livelihoods. However, intensive agricultural growth has caused immense natural resources \ndegradation  and  environmental  pollution.  Environmentally  unsustainable  farming  practices, \nresource-intensive industrial agricultural production, poor management of commercial plantations, \nand an increasing volume of agricultural products that require transport have all contributed to the \ndegradation of natural resources and environmental pollution. It is important to take a holistic \napproach to make the performance of agro-based value chains resource-efficient and green. \n \n9.  Climate change impacts. The region is highly vulnerable to climate change as a large \nproportion of population and economic activity is concentrated along coastlines and water bodies. \n \n5  Average agricultural land per capita ranges from 0.36 hectare in Cambodia as the largest and 0.12 hectare in \nViet Nam as the smallest. \n ", "3 \nThe region relies heavily on agriculture, the most climate vulnerable sector, for livelihood. \nAlthough the region\u2019s contribution to global greenhouse emissions is relatively low, the Intended \nNationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change identifies the \nregion\u2019s  increasing  energy  use  in  agriculture,  industry,  and  transportation,  together  with \ndeforestation and land-use change as the main factors for the rise in greenhouse gas emissions.6 \nAn ADB study projected that the region may lose up to 11% of gross domestic product by 2100 if \nno action is taken to address climate change.7 \n \n3.  Opportunities \n10.  Promotion of advanced technologies. The TA facility will help prepare and implement \ninvestment  projects  and  programs  that  will  address  the  above-mentioned  challenges  and \ncapitalize on the opportunities. These projects and programs will continue to (i) promote the use \nof  climate-smart  agricultural  practices;  (ii)  promote  the  adoption  of  advanced  technologies \n(iii) ensure the sustainable use of land and water resources;  (iv) enhance disaster preparedness \nand climate resilience (including early warning systems); and (v) promote inter-governmental \ncoordination. The projects will strengthen public infrastructure and services (e.g., irrigation, rural \nroads, public markets, and food safety-related facilities and services) to create enabling ANR \nsector development and business environments for agro-based value chain stakeholders. In \nparticular,  investing  in  infrastructure,  capacity  building,  and  policies  for  livestock  disease \nmonitoring, preparedness and control can increase productivity, inclusiveness, sustainability, and \nresilience of GMS livestock value chains, and contribute to the global COVID-19 responses and \nreduce the risk of future emerging infectious diseases with pandemic potential. The projects will \nalso promote private sector investment to accelerate growth by increasing productivity and value \naddition and ensure the quality of growth by improving food safety and environmental controls. \nThey will incorporate gender designs and targets to improve and support women\u2019s participation \nin and benefiting from these operations.  \n \n11.  The  TA  facility  will  support  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  and  its  operational  priorities  by \n(i) promoting rural development and food security; (ii) addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequalities; (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability; (iv) fostering regional cooperation and integration; (v) strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity; and (vi) accelerating progress in gender equality.8  \n \n12.  Lessons  learned  from  previous  TA  facility.  The  TA  facility  for  Southeast  Asia \nAgriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development Facility approved in December 2018, is \nthe first TA facility to provide project preparation and implementation support for the ANR sector \nin the Southeast Asia region.9 Preliminary results show time savings in (i) securing one-time \ngovernment no-objection letters to support preparation of several ensuing projects; and (ii) the \nconsultant recruitment by doing one-time advertisement and prequalifying eight consulting firms \nto prepare five ensuing projects. \n \nB.
