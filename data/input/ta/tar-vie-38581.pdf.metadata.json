The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) commits it \nto supporting the pursuit of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in the region and in ADB\u2019s \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs). MDG 6 is to halt and begin to reverse the spread of \nhuman  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV)  and  acquired  immune  deficiency  (AIDS)  by  2015. \nHowever, progress in this direction has not been encouraging and there is great concern that \nthe number of people infected in the Asia and Pacific region and in particular countries, \nincluding Viet Nam, could still significantly grow.  \n \n2.  The Government of Viet Nam has requested ADB's support for an HIV/AIDS focused \nactivity that will focus on youth and behavior change communication (BCC) strategies. The \nproposed activity is a key part of the Government's national AIDS strategy that to date is not \nwell-supported by national or international financial resources. The proposed targeting of the \nyouth, capacity building, and leadership advocacy using innovative approaches according to the \nnational strategy is consistent with ADB\u2019s proposed strategic directions in HIV/AIDS and fits in \nADB\u2019s country strategy. A concept paper was approved by the Vice President (Operations 1) on \n5 November 20041 and a technical assistance (TA) Fact-Finding Mission undertaken during 15-\n19 November 2004. This paper reflects the conclusions and understanding reached during that \nMission. An indicative project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam. Viet Nam\u2019s population is now about 81.2 million (2003). As of 30 \nAugust 2004, 84,484 cases of HIV infection had been officially reported. The Ministry of Health \n(MOH)  estimates  that  the  actual  number  is  about  3  times  that  (approximately  240,000) \nrepresenting 0.44% of the population. It is further estimated that 62% of those infected are \nbetween 20 and 29 years of age. For biological, cultural, social, and economic reasons, women \nand girls are more vulnerable to HIV infection and its impacts. While HIV infections have been \nrecorded in all of Viet Nam's 64 provinces, more than 50% of infections occur in just 10 \nprovinces2. A study by ADB and the Joint United Nations Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS) of the \nsocioeconomic impact of HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam predicts that households of people living with \nHIV/AIDS face a 34-41% decline in consumption expenditure and that poverty reduction in Viet \nNam could be slowed by 2% annually between 2003 and 2015.3    \n \n4.  Viet Nam's epidemic remains concentrated and to date largely contained among defined \nhigh-risk groups namely injecting drug users (IDUs) and commercial sex workers (CSWs) and, \nto a lesser extent, men who have sex with other men. As infection rates rise among high-risk \ngroups, particularly among women, it is increasingly probable that infection will spread beyond \nthe high-risk groups to the general population. Recognized conduits for this spread include the \nclients (mostly men) of CSWs who also have wives and girlfriends, men who have sex with \nother men who also have wives and girlfriends, IDUs who engage in sex work to support drug \naddictions, and CSWs that have IDU partners and support their drug use.  \n \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in November 2004. \n2  Provinces are: Ho Chi Minh City, Quang Ninh, Hai Phong, Hanoi, An Giang, Ba Ria \u2013 Vu Tau, Dong Nai, Nghe An, \nCan Tho, and Dong Thap. From Analysis of HIV/AIDS Situation in Viet Nam 1994-2004 \u2013 a presentation by Dr \nCuong of the Vietnam Commission for Population, Family and Children (VCPFC), 17 November 2004. \n3  ADB-UNAIDS.  2004.  The  Impact  of  HIV/AIDS  on  Poverty  in  Cambodia,  India,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam. \nADB/UNAIDS Study Series: Paper IV. (unpublished)  ", "2  \n5.  Social marginalization and discrimination drive many of the pathways of transmission \nand young people are disproportionately represented in all groups with high infection rates. The \nyouth(cid:190) including  adolescents  and  young  people  up  to  the  age  of  25(cid:190) are  a  particularly \nvulnerable group and one that needs to be targeted in particular ways. The youth represents a \nstage of life where significant changes in behavior and lifestyle occur including their first sexual \nactivity (average age in Viet Nam approximately 19 years), first exposure to drugs and alcohol, \nthe transition from school and family life to work, more personal freedom and responsibility, \nand(cid:190) in the case of rural youth(cid:190) possibly a transition to urban life. All these changes require life \nskills and resilience to manage successfully and present risks to health and well-being, including \nHIV infection, if not managed successfully. \n \n6.  In March 2004 the Government finalized the National Strategy on HIV/AIDS Prevention \nand Control in Viet Nam till 2010 with a Vision to 2020 (hereafter referred to as the National \nStrategy). The overall objective of the National Strategy is to keep the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate \namong the general population to below 0.3% by 2010 with no further increase and to reduce the \nadverse impacts of HIV/AIDS on social-economic development. The strategy recognizes that \nimplementation must be multisectoral and involve a range of Government ministries, mass \nmedia outlets, political leaders, sociopolitical organizations (e.g., the Fatherland Front and the \nWomen's  Union)  and  international  development  partners.  It  outlines  nine  action  programs \nincluding a Behavioral Change Information, Education and Communication Program; a Harm \nReduction Intervention and Transmission Prevention Program; and an HIV/AIDS Surveillance \nand Monitoring and Evaluation Program \n \n7.  Government and International HIV/AIDS Resources and Activities to Date.  The \nGovernment  currently  commits  about  D80  billion  (approximately  $6  million)  to  HIV/AIDS \nprograms each year. The analysis of resource needs in the National Strategy estimates Viet \nNam's needs to be about $300 million/year for a comprehensive response. Government and \nexternal resources are currently meeting about 25-30% of the need. \n \n8.  A range of aid and international agencies are active in supporting the response to \nHIV/AIDS in Viet Nam to date. Activities are focused on high-risk groups, harm reduction, care \nand support, and include the following: \n \n(i)  The Department for International Development (United Kingdom)(cid:190) $25 million \nover 5 years from January 2005 with a focus on condom promotion, pilot harm-\nreduction  programs,  and  management  and  care  of  sexually  transmitted \ninfections. \n(ii)  The Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria(cid:190) $7.5 million over 2 years \nwith a focus on care and support networks for  people living with HIV/AIDS, \nvoluntary counseling, and services for testing and preventing mother-to-child \ntransmission. \n(iii)  The United States President's Fund for AIDS Reduction(cid:190) approximately $14 \nmillion with a focus on care and support, voluntary counseling, and testing and \nprevention of mother-to-child transmission. \n(iv)  World Bank(cid:190) up to $35 million from 2005 for strategy implementation in 20 \nprovinces. \n \n9.  In  addition,  there  are  a  number  of  smaller  bilateral,  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs) and international programs, including the Swedish International Development Agency, \nUS Centers for Disease Control, United Nations Development Programme, United Nations ", "    3 \nChildren's  Fund,  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  and  the  international \nNGO(cid:190) Family  Health  International.  UNAIDS  plays  a  key  role  in  providing  technical  and \ncoordination support to the Government.  \n \n10.  ADB-Supported HIV/AIDS Activities in Viet Nam. ADB has been working on HIV/AIDS \nactivities in the Mekong region and Viet Nam since the mid-1990s with a focus on cross-border \npopulations and the risks associated with mobility and migration. At least four projects have \ninvolved Viet Nam, including the Community Action for Preventing HIV/AIDS Project (2001-\n2004).4 The Executing Agency in Viet Nam has been the Viet Nam Commission for Population, \nFamily and Children (VCPFC) and ADB's experience with the partnership has been positive. In \ncollaboration with the MOH, VCPFC has shown itself to be a strong implementing partner, able \nto effectively deliver programs. Although final project evaluations are still pending, there is \nevidence that the project has had an impact at the community level with improved awareness \nand prevention skills at a range of levels. With its experience and expertise in programs, focus \non families (including adolescents and youth) and an extensive network of community-based \ncollaborators, it seems appropriate to consider support for the role for VCPFC, in partnership \nwith other agencies, in the implementation plans for the National Strategy and to build on the \nachievements of the current project.  \n \n11.  ADB's Strategic Directions in Response to HIV/AIDS, in General and for Viet Nam. \nIn December 2004 ADB will finalize a strategic framework for its activities related to HIV/AIDS \nthat is based on a detailed analysis of where ADB's comparative advantages lie relative to the \nregion's needs, ADB's programs and technical strengths, and the work of other agencies and \naid sources in the region.5 The framework has proposed that the goal of ADB's activities be to \nsupport DMCs to achieve MDG 6/Target 7: to have halted and begun to reverse the spread of \nHIV/AIDS by 2015. Priority action areas identified include leadership support, capacity building, \nand interventions that target the poor and vulnerable. \n \n12.  While there has been a significant increase in the funding for HIV/AIDS programs from \nGovernment and aid sources, and an improvement in Viet Nam's strategic planning capacity \nthrough the development of its National Strategy, more is clearly needed. With only 30% of \nestimated  funding  needs  met  and  gaps  in  the  range  of  activities  currently  resourced, \nopportunities and needs exist for enhanced inputs and new partners. With ADB's strategic \ndirections in mind, the Viet Nam Country Strategy and Program with its focus on the health \nsector, the identified gaps in the current response to HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam, the growing \nepidemic among Vietnamese youth who are identified as vulnerable, and ADB's experience \nworking with VCPFC, which has a mandate to focus interventions on youth and families, it is \nappropriate and possible for ADB to consider a new project along these lines. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n13.  The TA will prepare a detailed project proposal and related documents on the basis of a \nreview  of  the  national  strategy  and  action  plans,  consultative  processes  and  participatory \nplanning, and relevant best practices in HIV/AIDS and related fields. \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2001.

Supported by the Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction. \n5  The paper Strategic Directions for ADB in Response to HIV/AIDS in the Asia and Pacific Region in which the   \nframework is proposed, is currently (as of December 2004) in draft form and subject to change based on review \nand consultation processes currently under way. A final paper should be available by the end of 2004. ", "4  \n \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The TA will include a review of the data and analyses of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Viet \nNam and in other countries, and associated issues such as studies of adolescence and youth, \ncommunity-based behavior change programs, mass media interventions, and a review of what \nother  agencies  are  doing  in  these  areas  and  what  lessons  have  been  learned.  Gender- \ndisaggregated data will be used or generated for all issues. The team will consult with a wide \nrange of stakeholders6 through workshops and consultations at the community level. \n \n15.  The TA will include the following:  \n \n(i)  Awareness  and  advocacy  among  community  leaders  for  HIV/AIDS \nprevention.  Develop and implement programs among community leaders to \nraise awareness and support discussion of the issues facing the youth. \n(ii)  HIV-related BCC interventions for adolescents and youth. Develop a range \nof interventions targeted to adolescents/youth at different stages of development \nand in different settings, including schools, and focusing particularly on those at \nhigh risk for HIV infection.  \n(iii)  Family  strengthening  and  community  resource  development  using \ncollaborator networks. Using the extensive networks of the family-planning \ncollaborators,  develop  programs  to  strengthen  their  knowledge  and \ncommunication skills so as to enhance their interactions with families.  \n(iv)  Monitoring and evaluation systems for BCC. Given the importance of critical \nreview and regular tracking of the epidemic, this component will ensure project \ncompliance with and support for the \"3 ones\" principles7 in relation to monitoring \nand evaluation. \n(v)  Program  management  and  operational  research.  Given  the  range  of \ninterventions developed and used under this project and the different community \nsettings in which they will be implemented, strong program management models \nare needed, to include operational research to review new approaches. \n \n16.  The  TA  will  identify  approximately  15-17  provinces  to  be  targeted  in  project \nimplementation based on a range of considerations8 including programs already in place, \nimplementation capacity, and the need and potential to benefit based on HIV prevalence, risk \nbehavior, and environments. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent comprising \n$290,000 in foreign exchange and $210,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will provide \n$400,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange and $110,000 equivalent in the local \ncurrency cost. The Government will finance the remaining $100,000 equivalent in the local \ncurrency cost through in-kind contributions including government counterpart staff, field visits, \n                                                 \n6  Including government ministries; teachers; youth; high-risk groups; people living with HIV/AIDS; the women\u2019s, \nyouth, and farmer's unions; health workers; nongovernment organizations, and external agencies \n7  UNAIDS proposed principles of \"3 ones\" ask that all donors and development partners support one national AIDS \ncoordination authority, one national AIDS strategy, and one national monitoring and evaluation system. \n8  In site selection, attention should be paid to areas of current ADB activity in other sectors, including transport. ", "    5 \nworkshops, office accommodation, and utilities. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  VCPFC will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The TA will start in March 2005 and be \ncompleted by July 2005.    \n \n19.  The TA will be guided by a steering committee chaired by the Chairman of VCPFC, and \ninclude MOH - AIDS Division, Ministry of Planning and Investment, Ministry of Finance, Ministry \nof Education and Training, State Bank of Vietnam, Viet Nam Women's Union and Viet Nam \nYouth Union. Regular consultation with implementing and technical support partners will be \nfacilitated through a technical steering committee. Members will be technical experts from the \nabove-named agencies and other development or implementation partners as identified.  \n \n20.  A project management unit (PMU) will be established in VCPFC. The PMU will be \nresponsible for coordinating the TA, including liaison with stakeholders, data analysis, support of \nconsultants, provision of office space and logistic support, organizing workshops, and other \nmatters.  The  PMU  will  have  a  full-time  senior  planning  officer  of  VCPFC  in  charge,  two \ncounterparts, and two program assistants; and  will be supported by other planning officers \ncoming from the partner agencies as needed and appropriate. \n \n21.  Consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB  for engaging domestic consultants. \nConsultant inputs will be  13 international (person-months) and 20 domestic person-months. \nInternational consultants will include specialists in team leadership, HIV/AIDS prevention and \nproject management (4.5), communication and media (4), social development and HIV/AIDS \neducation (3), and economics (1.5).
