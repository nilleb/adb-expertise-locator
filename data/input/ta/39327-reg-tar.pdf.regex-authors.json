The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been involved in the energy sector of its \ndeveloping  member  countries  (DMCs)  since  the  early  1980s.  The  first  energy  policy  was \napproved in 19811 just after the second oil crisis of 1979. This defined ADB\u2019s role in the energy \nsector of DMCs and recommended major investments in infrastructure and maximizing the use \nof indigenous sources of supply. The second energy policy paper,2 approved in 1995, identified \nmajor sectoral issues and concerns which centered on (i) defining an appropriate role for \ngovernments; (ii) enhancing the efficient production, transportation, and end use of energy; and \n(iii) integrating environmental considerations in all energy sector activities to enable sustainable \ndevelopment. It recommended tariff rationalization, full cost recovery, reduction and removal of \nsubsidies and cross-subsidies, setting up independent regulatory mechanisms, corporatization \nand privatization of state-owned utilities, and regional cooperation in energy development.  \n \n2.  The 1995 policy was further reviewed in 2000 (2000 Review).3 This confirmed that the \nframework was appropriate and sound. However, realignment was necessary to focus on the \nrevised operational priorities: (i) reducing poverty in the region, (ii) promoting private sector \ninvolvement, (iii) addressing social and environmental impacts, and (iv) promoting regional \ncooperation. Within these priorities, the 2000 Review supported sector restructuring, private \nsector participation, rationalization of tariffs, efficiency improvements, poverty reduction, social \ndevelopment,  governance,  information  technology,  energy  conservation,  cofinancing,  and \ncapacity building. \n \n3.  Although overall assistance during 2001\u20132005 in the energy sector was reduced to $3.2 \nbillion  from  $4.1  billion  during  1996\u20132000,  substantial  progress  was  achieved  in  the \ntransmission and distribution sectors, sector reforms, transparent tariff setting, reduction in \nsubsidies,  and  environmental  and  social  aspects.  ADB  supported  these  initiatives  through \nsector development program support, systems improvement, regional cooperation, metering, \nregulatory mechanisms, and enhanced investments and ordinary capital resources lending for \nprivate sector projects which increased from $200 million during 1996\u20132000 to $683 million \nduring 2001\u20132005. However, the current rise in fuel prices has impacted energy security and \nhence focus will need to shift toward efficient uses of energy, clean energy development, energy \nsecurity, and use of indigenous sources of fuel. Greenhouse gas emission levels are reaching \nalarming levels, which highlights the need for sustainable uses of energy. Studies by the United \nNations 4  and  other  agencies  have  concluded  that  energy  accessibility  is  an  important \ncomponent to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Therefore, it is now imperative that \nADB\u2019s energy strategy is reviewed to align its operations to provide meaningful support to \nDMCs. The 2000 Review also recommended a review in 2005. Accordingly, the Regional and \nSustainable  Development  Department  (RSDD)  requested  the  Operations  Evaluation \nDepartment to conduct an independent evaluation of the 2000 Review to assess its relevance \nand effectiveness in directing and guiding ADB\u2019s operations in the energy sector. This study is \ncurrently ongoing and initial findings are expected in August 2006. The Energy, Transport, and \nWater Division (RSID) of the RSDD will build upon these findings and develop a sustainable \nstrategy that should guide ADB\u2019s energy sector operations for the next 5 years.5 \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1981.

Asia's current annual energy consumption of over 2.100 billion tons of oil equivalent is \nexpected to more than double by 2025. In the same period, annual electricity demand is \nexpected to grow from 2.6 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) to 6.3 trillion kWh.6 The energy sector \nremains an important area of ADB\u2019s operations, representing about 15% of total lending during \nthe last few years. As the energy sector is evolving across DMCs, the current pattern of energy \nsector growth is becoming unsustainable from both the security and environmental perspectives. \nFor instance, greenhouse gas emissions in the region are expected to rise from 6 billion tons to \n12  billion  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO )  equivalent  by  2020,  accounting  for  32%  of  global \n2\nemissions from the energy sector (footnote 6). DMCs face threats to energy security because of \ntheir heavy dependence on increasing imports of oil and natural gas, whose prices are rising \nrapidly. Most policy makers in Asia have also begun to realize that a business-as-usual scenario \nis clearly not sustainable. However, long-term strategies for adopting cleaner technologies\u2014\nsuch as energy efficiency, renewable energy, and clean coal technologies\u2014have been limited, \nfar below their actual potential.   \n \n5.  DMCs require a stable and assured supply of energy (i) to promote higher economic \ngrowth; and (ii) for the effective delivery of social services like education and health care, which \nare essential for poverty reduction. Some DMCs have high savings rates that are directed \ntoward energy supply additions but others need external borrowings. Nearly all DMCs import \nprimary energy. Investments in the energy sector are no longer viewed as strategic (to be \ncontrolled  directly  by  the  government);  private  enterprises  have  been  established  in  most \ncountries to implement projects and manage the business.  \n \n6.  Globally, it is now recognized that the increase in CO   induced by human activity results \n2\nin  climate  change,  the  greenhouse  effect,  and  changes  in  atmospheric  behavior.  Possible \nimpacts are global warming, changing precipitation, more intense storms, arctic ice melting, sea \nlevel rise, and ocean warming. One way to address climate change effects is to contain the \nincrease in the production of greenhouse gases, such as CO . This would entail the use of \n2\ncleaner energy technologies. ADB\u2019s Energy Efficiency Initiative (EEI) addressed this aspect of \nADB\u2019s future operations and proposed lending levels of $1 billion annually for clean energy \nprojects within the next 2\u20133 years. ADB\u2019s energy strategy will build on this initiative.  \n \n7.  Although substantial progress has been achieved in power sector restructuring, much \nremains to be done. Reforms have been slow, mainly due to overambitious expectations, and \nthe  associated  hesitancy  in  the  political  and  economical  changes.  The  reform  process  is \nongoing  and  will  continue  slowly.  Efforts  need  to  be  focused  on  independent  regulatory \nstructures and pricing mechanisms. \n \n8.  Privatization  is  also  slow.  Some  DMCs  went  ahead  but  there  has  been  some \nbacktracking or a slowdown in new private sector projects. Investing in private power projects is \nnot  an  attractive  option.  Interest  rates  have  risen,  even  when  projects  are  supported  by \nsovereign guarantees. Allegations of overpricing and take-or-pay type of agreements have \nmade DMCs more careful in handling private sector proposals. On the other hand, lack of \nadequate  transparency  in  selecting  promoters,  nonavailability  of  level  playing  fields,  and \nrenegotiation of power purchase agreements have made promoters reluctant to invest in such \nprojects. Despite these problems, ADB\u2019s support to private sector participation in the energy \nsector  has  increased  substantially.  ADB\u2019s  presence  reassures  stakeholders.  Further  focus \nshould be on supporting financial markets, regulatory regimes, power purchase agreements, \nassistance in reducing project risks, and encouraging transparency. \n                                                 \n6  International Energy Agency.

The  expected  impact  over  time  of  this  regional  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  to \nsubstantially increase the use of clean energy and provide energy security in the region. \n \n10.  The intended outcome of this TA is to develop and recommend strategies that ADB \nneeds to adopt in its lending operations to further enhance the effectiveness of its energy sector \nassistance to DMCs along the four priority areas highlighted in the 2000 Review.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n  1.  Energy Sector Strategy \n \n11.  The  study  will  assess  the  reasons  for  the  recent  decline  in  ADB\u2019s  energy  sector \noperations. It will address a broad range of growing challenges in the sector (e.g., increasing \nvulnerability to oil dependency and imports), and linkages to environmental risks as well as \nincentives\u2014such  as  the  clean  development  mechanism,  mainstreaming  private  sector \nparticipation, expanding the role of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and demand side \nmanagement. It will also recommend possible solutions in the context of lending modalities and \napproaches in ADB\u2019s energy sector operations in the medium and long term, particularly 2007\u2013\n2012.  These  solutions  may  include  or  extend  beyond  innovative  credit  enhancement \nmechanisms already adopted by ADB, such as partial credit and political risk guarantees. The \nlinkages of energy sector operations to poverty reduction and ways to evaluate and monitor \nthese impacts will also be examined as part of the strategy recommendations. Finally, the \nstrategy will provide estimates and/or targets for ADB\u2019s future role in contributing towards \nenergy sector development in Asia for the next 5 years. \n \n12.  A consultative approach will be followed throughout the process. Within ADB, RSDD\u2019s \nRSID will be responsible for the study under the overall guidance of the energy community of \npractice (CoP). The CoP will provide regular expert inputs and support for the preparation of the \npaper. The strategy paper will be processed in one stage and circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of \nDirectors  for  information.  An  informal  Board  seminar  will  be  held  after  intra-  and \ninterdepartmental review of the draft strategy paper, external consultations in accordance with \nthe Public Consultation Policy, web posting, and a management review meeting. \n \n13.  The external consultation process, using ADB\u2019s Guidelines for External Consultations \nand  Policy  on  Disclosure,  will  be  designed  to  solicit  input  and  advice  from  a  range  of \ninternational stakeholders and experts from DMCs, as appropriate, so that the paper will be \nbased on best international practices and adequate engagement of interested parties. A panel \nof experts will be engaged as resource persons who will provide strategic direction throughout \nthe course of strategy formulation and review. The energy sector strategy 2006 paper will \npropose a set of strategic options to achieve the objectives established by the 1995 energy \npolicy and the 2000 Review.  \n \n2.  Energy Outlook and Data Book 2007 for the Asia and Pacific Region \n \n14.  Asia\u2019s rapidly growing energy requirement and recent oil price developments give rise to \nconcerns  to  long-term  energy  security.  Coupled  with  economic,  social,  environmental,  and \ngeopolitical  implications,  energy  security  issues  reach  far  beyond  national  borders,  hence \nrequire a multilateral approach, yet tightly linked to the regional development strategies. Asian \neconomies, in general, rely heavily on oil imports and exhibit energy intensive growth patterns. \nIn this context, a clear understanding of energy needs, available and alternate energy sources \n ", "4   \nbased on reliable data, analysis, and outlook, constitutes a key element in their policy and \ninvestment decision making with a view to securing adequate energy supply and eventually \nsafeguarding the regional economic and political stability. As part of this regional TA, it is \nproposed that ADB produce a document that will address the concerns of DMCs and provide \nthem with a comprehensive source of energy data and available options. This sourcebook will \nbe  jointly  prepared  by  ADB  and  a  group  of  well-established,  reputable  energy  research \ninstitutions, including the International Energy Agency (IEA), which may provide significant \ncollaborative work. The tentative title of the book is \u201cEnergy Outlook and Data Book 2007 for the \nAsia  and  Pacific  Region\u201d.  RSID  and  Economics  and  Research  Department\u2019s  (ERD) \nMacroeconomics and Finance Research Division (ERMF) will be in close coordination for the \noverall guidance and ensure effective collaboration  with other leading institutes through regular \nreview meetings. \n \n3.  Energy Efficiency Initiative \n \n15.  The objective of the EEI is to expand ADB\u2019s investments in energy efficiency (including \nrenewable energy) projects to $1 billion a year (para. 6). The EEI is being implemented in three \nphases.  Phase I, completed in March 2006, produced a report that firmly establishes the \nrationale for expanded and sustained ADB action and energy efficiency investment. It also \ndefined the general principles and action plan, and provides priorities and a framework for next \nsteps. Phase II will (i) develop country-level and regional strategies and action plans on how to \nreach the target set for EEI, and (ii) examine the need for establishing the Asia-Pacific fund for \nenergy efficiency.7 Immediate energy efficiency investment opportunities will be pursued even \nduring Phase II. The strategies and action plans will be implemented in Phase III (2007\u20132010).  \nResources from the regional TA will be used to implement Phase II.   \n \n16.  As part of the EEI, ADB is organizing a conference on clean energy from 20\u201322 June \n2006. The ADB Clean Energy Week will be a knowledge-sharing event among practitioners and \npolicy makers engaged in crosscutting issues of clean energy development and financing, \nclimate change, energy access and security, and governance in the energy sector. The Clean \nEnergy Week will provide a unique opportunity for ADB\u2019s DMC clients, donor governments, \nnongovernment  organizations,  the  private  sector,  academics,  and  other  players  with  an \nimportant stake in the Asian energy agenda to interact and exchange lessons learned across \nthe region. The three-day event will further contribute to discussions necessary for ADB as it \nbegins to rethink its own energy policy and reformulates a strategic approach to address DMCs\u2019 \nenergy needs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the regional TA, estimated at $1,000,000, will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The  TA  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  are  in \nAppendix 2. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7  The Asia-Pacific Fund for energy efficiency (APFEE) will have three main functions: (i) mitigating risk. It will \nunderwrite risks of energy efficiency projects to improve access to capital; (ii) increasing access to technology.  \nFor innovative and demonstrative energy efficiency technologies, the APFEE will provide concessional loans to \nlower capital cost and make such projects financially viable; and (iii) capacity building. The APFEE will provide \ngrant assistance for non-lending measures, such as developing the knowledge base and incentive mechanisms, \nadvocacy, institutional capacity building, project preparation, and establishment of the monitoring and evaluation \nmechanism. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Energy Strategy \n17.  This component of the regional TA will be implemented over 12 months from August \n2006 to July 2007. ADB will serve as the Executing Agency, and RSDD\u2019s RSID will be the \nimplementing unit. One international expert/consultant will be recruited for 4 person-months. \nMission  travel  will  be  required  for  the  consultant  to  selected  countries  for  in-country \nconsultations. An energy research consultant will be recruited for research and presentation \nsupport. The draft strategy will undergo external peer review and consultations. Subregional \nstakeholder consultations and/or workshops will be conducted in selected key DMCs, to be \ndetermined later. An external panel of experts will be retained as resource persons to provide \nstrategic  directions  for  the  preparation  of  the  strategy.  The  terms  of  reference  for  the \ninternational  consultant,  the  energy  research  consultant,  and  the  panel  of  experts  are  in \nAppendix 3. Consultants will be recruited as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants.\n \n \n \n2.   Energy Outlook and Data Book 2007 for Asia and Pacific Region \n \n18.  This component will be implemented over 12 months from August 2006 to July 2007. \nADB will serve as the Executing Agency and RSDD\u2019s RSID and ERD\u2019s ERMF will be the \nimplementing units. ADB will recruit a group of regional energy research institutes to conduct \nresearch on a regional basis, compile data, and submit a detailed analysis of the energy sector \nof the Asia and Pacific region for the medium and long term. IEA is the producer of the World \nEnergy Outlook, which can be benchmarked by the proposed energy outlook for Asia and  \nPacific region. Hence, it is desirable that ADB taps into IEA\u2019s knowledge base, research network \nand know-how. Details will be worked out after further consultations with IEA and other regional \nresearch institutes. The international and domestic consultants will be recruited as individuals in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants to assist the team leader in the \npreparation  of  the  energy  outlook,  analytical  work,  data  management,  and  copy  editing.  \nBecause of the specialized nature of work and expertise, the regional energy research institutes \nwill  be  recruited  following  single  source  selection  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n3.  Energy Efficiency Initiative \n \n19.  This component will be implemented over 19 months from June 2006 to December 2007. \nADB will serve as the executing agency and RSDD\u2019s RSID will be the implementing unit. One \ninternational expert/consultant will be recruited for 12 months. Mission travel will be required for \nthe consultant who will conduct research on energy efficiency markets and policies and compile \nfeasibility  studies  for  specific  projects.  The  consultant  will  be  recruited  as  an  individual  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The Clean Energy Week will be \nheld in ADB headquarters on 20-22 June 2006 under the overall supervision of RSDD. The \nregional TA will finance the expenses of DMC officials participating in the Clean Energy Week \nwhich  will  be  cofinanced  with  the  Promoting  Renewable  Energy,  Energy  Efficiency,  and \nGreenhouse Gas Abatement8 project. \n \nIV.
