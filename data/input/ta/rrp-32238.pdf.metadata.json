Capacity\nbuilding  for  improved  governance  is  a  critical  factor  for\nachieving  the  Government\u2019s  overarching  goal  of\nsustainable poverty reduction. Governance reform is a key\nelement  of  the  Government\u2019s  broader  economic  and\nstructural  reform  program,  which  seeks  to  sustain\naccelerated growth and economic stability.\nPoor  public  sector  governance  has  contributed  to  a\ndemoralized  bureaucracy,  misallocation  of  budget\nresources, and ineffective implementation of development\nprograms.  Increasing  allegations  of  corruption  at  many\nlevels represent a key constraint to effective delivery of\nessential  services.  Basic  institutions  essential  to  the\neffective functioning of a market economy do not exist or\ndo  not  operate  effectively.  Poor  governance  and\nperformance  of  public  agencies  waste  limited  public\nresources,  affect  the  quality  and  quantity  of  public  and\nprivate  investment,  constrain  economic  growth,  and\nweaken the Government\u2019s poverty reduction program. The\ncivil  service  also  suffers  from  a  significant  gender\nimbalance. The Governance Reform Program will seek to\nremove administrative, financial, and gender weaknesses\nin the civil service by introducing institutional reforms to\nimprove  efficiency,  transparency,  accountability,\npredictability,  and  processes  for  redressing  gender\nimbalance.\nObjectives\nand Scope   The overall goal of the Governance Reform Program is to\nestablish a civil service that is more results- and people-\noriented and gender responsive, and that will contribute\ntowards higher economic growth and reducing poverty.\nThe objectives of the Program are to (i) develop internal\ncapacity within the Government to lead and undertake the\ngovernance reform agenda, (ii) improve the efficiency of\nthe  civil  service,  (iii)  improve  governance  and  reduce\ncorruption  in  the  Government,  (iv)  enhance  the\ncompetence  and  motivation  of  civil  servants,  and  (v)", "iv\nestablish  processes  for  improving  performance  in  key\nministries.\nClassification   Economic growth\nEnvironmental\nAssessment   Category C\nEnvironmental implications of the Program were reviewed,\nand no significant environmental impacts were identified.\nThe Asian Development Bank Loan\nLoan Amount\nand Terms   It  is  proposed  that  a  loan  of  Special  Drawing  Rights\n23,484,000, equivalent to $30 million, be provided from\nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  support  the\nGovernment\u2019s Program. The loan will have a maturity of 24\nyears  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years.  The  rate  of\ninterest  will  be  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace\nperiod and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\nProgram Period\nand Tranching   The program period is expected to be four years, from\nDecember 2001 to December 2005. Disbursements will be\nmade under the simplified procedures for program loans.\nThe loan includes three tranches: a first tranche of $12\nmillion equivalent, followed by two tranches of $9 million\nequivalent each. The first tranche will be released upon\nloan  effectiveness.  The  remaining  tranches  will  be\nreleased  at  intervals  of  approximately  18  months.  The\nProgram  contains  a  number  of  tranche  conditions  and\nmilestones that must be fulfilled for tranche releases and\nthe successful completion of the Program.\nExecuting\nAgency   The Ministry of General Administration will have overall\nresponsibility for the implementation of the Program. The\nEfficiency  Unit  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  change\nmanagement  units  in  the  ministries  of  Agriculture  and\nCooperatives, Education and Sports, and Health will also\nimplement selected program components.\nProcurement   The loan proceeds will finance the full foreign exchange\ncost (excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced in\nand procured from ADB\u2019s member countries (other than\nthose items specified in Appendix 7 and imports financed\nby other bilateral and multilateral sources). Procurement of\neligible items will be on the basis of normal commercial\npractices for procurement by the private sector or standard\nGovernment procurement procedures acceptable to ADB\nfor procurement by the public sector, except in the case of", "v\ngoods  commonly  traded  on  international  commodity\nmarkets,  where  procurement  will  be  undertaken  in\naccordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and\nacceptable to ADB.\nUtilization\nof the Loan  The loan will be disbursed within the first three years, until\n30 December 2004. However, program activities will cover\na  four-year  period  prior  to  the  loan  closing  date.  Loan\nproceeds from the first tranche can be used to finance\neligible expenditures incurred up to 180 days prior to the\ndate of loan effectiveness.\nCounterpart\nFunds   The  counterpart  funds  to  be  generated  from  the  loan\nproceeds will be used to meet the financing requirements\nof  the  Program  as  follows:  (i)  the  $63  million  cost  for\nimplementation of the voluntary early retirement scheme,\n(ii) pay changes that may possibly amount to $37.7 million\nin the first phase of the scheme, (iii) staff induction and\ntraining  costs  of  $2  million,  (iv)  a  performance\nimprovement  fund  cost  of  $1.5  million  and,  (v)  other\nmiscellaneous costs.\nTechnical Assistance  Cofinanced TA in three contract packages for a total of $2\nmillion  will  provide  support  for  (i)  core  program\nmanagement reforms, (ii) civil society support for reform\nmeasures, and (iii) independent program monitoring and\nreporting.\nRisks and\nSafeguards A basic assumption in the formulation of the Program is\nthat the Government and in particular a few central position\nholders are prepared to undertake major changes in the\nway the civil service is led, motivated, and evaluated, and\nto reduce corruption. It is also assumed that improvements\nin these important factors will underpin the likelihood of\nimproved performance in key areas of implementation and\nservice delivery. Political instability and a lack of political\nwill to implement the reforms would certainly undermine\nthe reform process. This risk is mitigated by (i) using three\ntranches  over  three  years  to  ensure  that  government\ncommitment  is  sustained  and  demonstrated  over  the\nmedium term; (ii) providing performance incentive funds to\nmotivate participating ministries to implement the reforms;\n(iii)  actively  engaging  civil  society  in  the  program  as\nadvocates  of  the  reforms  to  maintain  pressure  on  the\nGovernment to implement the Program, to involve citizens\nin pushing for reforms, and to monitor implementation; (iv)\nstrengthening  anticorruption  agencies  and  citizen\ninvolvement  in  identifying  corruption  cases;  and  (v)", "vi\nproviding  cofinanced  TA  to  strengthen  institutional\ncapacity. All political parties in Nepal have indicated that\ngovernance reform is one of their priority commitments.\nThere is a risk that the management skills in areas that are\nnew to government employees may not be quickly learned.\nThe  program  design  takes  account  of  this  factor  by\nproviding training programs, mentoring and implementation\nassistance,  and  close  monitoring  of  program\nimplementation, with independent program monitoring as\nwell.", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Governance Reform Program (GRP).\nI.  INTRODUCTION\n2. Civil service reform and elimination of corruption (collectively referred to as governance\nreforms) are two top priorities of the Government contained in the comprehensive Priority\nReform Program discussed with the country\u2019s development partners at the Nepal Development\nForum held in Paris in April 2000. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) country program for\n2001  includes  a  program  loan  to  support  the  implementation  of  governance  reforms,  in\nrecognition of their importance to Nepal\u2019s development prospects.\n3. The GRP was prepared as a result of extensive stakeholder consultations and policy\ndialogue with the Government. A Loan Reconnaissance Mission went to Nepal in March-April\n2000 and held workshops with key stakeholders to identify the constraints to, and priorities and\nopportunities for governance reform. Further technical assistance (TA) to assist the Government\nin preparing for the reform program was identified as an urgent need. Stakeholder consultations\nwere subsequently held by the Government to develop ownership for the GRP, and to prioritize\nrequired reform actions.\n4.  Recognizing the constraints facing the reform program, the Government requested\nadvisory TA1 to assist it in building the leadership capacity to prepare for and implement the\nreform program. Policy dialogue on reforms was initiated while the TA was being processed,\nresulting in the Government introducing a number of reform initiatives, including establishment\nof two reform change units in the Ministry of General Administration (MOGA) and Ministry of\nFinance (MOF) to manage the reform process. The Cabinet also approved formation of a\nsecretary-level executive committee to steer the reform process and the GRP. The scope and\nimplementation arrangements of the GRP were firmed up during a Loan Fact-Finding Mission in\nMay-June 2001. Subsequently, a Loan Appraisal Mission further refined the program scope and\npolicy matrix in August 2001.2\nI.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\nA.  Development Objectives, Strategies, and Plans\n5. It  is  acknowledged  in  the  Ninth  Plan  document  (1997-2002)  that,  despite  previous\nattempts at administrative reform, Nepalese government administration has remained inefficient,\nwith a poor record of service delivery. The objective of the Ninth Plan is to make public\nmanagement  clean,  lean,  transparent,  economical,  competitive,  job-oriented,  capable,\nproductive, service-oriented, and accountable. The Plan document states that public resource\nmanagement  is  to  become  effective,  and  the  concept  of  good  governance  and  effective\ngovernment is to be promoted. The role of civil society in governance is also to be enhanced.\n                  \n1 TA 3622-NEP: Institutional Support for Governance Reforms, for $1,525,000, approved on 18 January 2001.\n2  The Mission consisted of B. Fawcett, Senior Programs Officer/Mission Leader, PW1; C. Vandenabeele, Counsel,\nOGC; C. Steffensen, Senior Programs Officer, PW1; J. Jabes, Governance Advisor, SPD; K. Julian, Senior\nPrograms/Implementation Officer, Nepal Resident Mission (NRM); R. Tuladhar, Senior Programs Officer, NRM; A.\nShrestha, Gender Consultant, NRM; and S. Shrestha, Senior Governance and Capacity Building Officer, NRM. R.\nVokes, Resident Representative, NRM, provided guidance to the Mission. Staff from NRM also provided support\nand assistance to the Mission.", "2\nThe Budget Speech for FY2001 further stressed the need to make government administration\npeople-oriented, transparent, and accountable. Emphasis was put on the need to take action\nagainst corrupt practices. To make the civil service productive, efficient, and effective, the\nBudget Speech highlighted the need to review positions and organizations, and to trim or\n\u201crightsize\u201d the bureaucracy. The commitment to achieve these objectives was reaffirmed in the\nBudget Speech for FY2002.\n6. The  Government,  in  conjunction  with  the  April  2000  Nepal  Development  Forum,\napproved a comprehensive program for reform and poverty reduction with a time-bound action\nplan. The strategic focus was on addressing the problems and weaknesses facing many sectors\nof the economy, and to develop a sustainable framework for poverty reduction. Major reform\nareas identified for priority action included (i) consolidation of the macroeconomic and fiscal\nstructure, (ii) private sector development, (iii) financial sector reform, (iv) decentralization, (v)\ngovernance, (vi) aid effectiveness, (vii) civil service reform, and (viii) an enhanced role for civil\nsociety. In the important area of macroeconomic and fiscal reform, the Government has sought\nto (i) prioritize resource allocation at the public and national levels to key areas such as poverty\nreduction,  employment  promotion,  and  support  for  key  sectors;  (ii)  improve  resource\nmobilization; (iii) reform public expenditure management; and (iv) improve the fiscal structure,\nparticularly the fiscal deficit.\n7. The  Government\u2019s  broader  governance  agenda,  which  is  part  of  its  overall  Priority\nReform Program, is to reorient the role of government and the bureaucracy to one of facilitation,\npolicy formulation, and regulation within a competitive market economy. The Government seeks\nto strengthen public institutions so that they will adequately perform vital state functions to\npromote good governance, including fighting corruption. The Government\u2019s goal for reform of\nNepal\u2019s  civil  service  is  to  develop  a  much  more  results-  and  people-oriented  governance\nenvironment  that  will  contribute  to  accelerated  growth  and  poverty  reduction  through  the\nintroduction of appropriate policies and mechanisms related to efficiency, performance, and\nhuman resource management. Such a civil service will be both efficient and ultimately focused\non providing better public services for its clients. This vision will only be realized in the long\nterm, over a period of perhaps 10-15 years.\nA.  Recent Macroeconomic Performance and Prospects\n 8. Nepal\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have grown by 5.8 percent in\nFY2001, compared with 6.4 percent in FY2000. Domestic revenue collection is estimated to be\nlower than budgeted for FY2001, remaining at the previous year\u2019s level of about 11 percent of\nGDP. The budget deficit is expected to have increased to about 5.0 percent of GDP in FY2001,\ncompared with about 4.0 percent in the previous year, as a result of increased spending on\nsecurity,  a  salary  increase  for  civil  servants,  and  the  implementation  of  a  voluntary  early\nretirement scheme (VERS). Inflation is projected to have increased only slightly in FY2001 from\nits 3.5 percent level in FY2000 as a result of stable food and beverage prices.\n9. On the external front, satisfactory export growth and slower import growth has helped to\nnarrow the trade deficit and subsequently the current account deficit, which is expected to be\nless than 5 percent of GDP in FY2001, below the average of 8 percent that prevailed during the\n1990s. During FY2001, imports grew by 5.5 percent compared with 24.5 percent in FY2000,\nwhile exports grew by 15.6 percent, compared to 40 percent in FY2000. By the end of FY2001,\nNepal had about $1 billion in foreign exchange reserves, enough to cover about 8 months of\nimports. External debt is projected to be less than 47 percent of GDP in FY2001, below the\naverage level of 53 percent that prevailed during the 1990s. The debt service obligation is", "3\nestimated to fall to about 4 percent of exports in FY2001 because of concessional lending terms\nto Nepal.\n10. The goal of the FY2002 budget is to reduce poverty. The budget was ambitious with a\ntotal outlay of NRe99.8 billion ($1.3 billion), representing an increase of 51 percent over the\nrevised estimate of NRe60.7 billion ($876 million) for FY2001. The fiscal deficit in FY2002 is\nexpected to be about 5 percent of GDP. Development expenditures are projected to grow by 27\npercent,  to  be  financed  mainly  by  foreign  grants.  Domestic  revenue  estimates  are  also\noptimistic, with a projected growth rate of 21 percent, particularly in light of the negative impact\nof the security situation on business activity and tax revenues. The FY2002 budget stresses the\nimportance of continuing the reform agenda initiated during FY2001, which includes public\nexpenditure management reforms, financial sector reform, and private sector development.\nGovernance reform is also highlighted in the budget statement, including the need to address\ncorruption, and to make the civil service responsive, accountable, and transparent.\n11. While the Government has maintained a stable macroeconomic environment, Nepal\u2019s\neconomic  success  in  the  medium  term  depends  on  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  address\nstructural weaknesses, particularly in the financial sector, governance and institutional issues,\naid utilization, and the fiscal deficit. With the majority of the country\u2019s poor depending on\nagriculture for their livelihood, improving the performance of the agriculture sector is also critical.\nSustained improvement of the trade deficit in the medium term will require institutional and\npolicy  reforms  to  broaden  the  composition  of  exports  and  destinations.  To  reduce  the\ndependence  on  foreign  assistance  for  the  country\u2019s  development  expenditures,  continued\nefforts  are  needed  to  mobilize  domestic  resources  and  reduce  the  fiscal  deficit.  The\nGovernment must also implement tax reforms, financial sector reforms, privatization of state-\nowned enterprises, and strengthening of the capital market. Ultimately, if the country is to\nachieve the levels of sustained growth necessary to lift it out of poverty, the Government needs\nto continue to pursue its broad-based reform agenda, with financial sector and governance\nreforms forming its core.\nC.  Poverty and Social Development\n1.  Poverty\n12. About 42 percent of the population live below the national poverty line of NRe4,400\n($77) per capita per annum, which is based on minimum caloric intake, housing, and other\nnonfood  standards.  The  Nepal  Poverty  Analysis  recently  completed  with  ADB  assistance3\nshows that poverty incidence, intensity, and severity have not improved over the past quarter\ncentury, a finding mirrored in the country\u2019s low scores on human development indicators relative\nto  those  of  other  South  Asian  nations.  Further,  inequalities  and  the  scores  on  human\ndevelopment indicators across ecological zones, geographic regions, and the rural-urban divide\nremain wide, as do those when the levels for specific gender, ethnic, and caste groups are\ncompared with counterpart values for the population as a whole.\n13. Specifically,  the  Poverty  Analysis  confirmed  that  poverty  is  much  more  prevalent,\nintense, and severe in rural areas, with the incidence of rural poverty almost double that of\nurban areas (44 percent of the rural population is poor compared with 23 percent in urban\nareas), and with 90 percent of the country\u2019s poor living in rural areas. Geographically, the\n                  \n3  TA 3362-NEP: SSTA for a Partnership Agreement on Poverty Reduction between ADB and the Government of\nNepal, for $125,000, approved on 22 December 1999.", "4\nincidence of poverty in the Midwestern and Far Western development regions greatly exceeds\nthe national average, as does the rate in the mountain districts.4 Gender-based exclusion in the\ncountry is pervasive and deep, resulting in reduced physical survival of girls and women, fewer\nhealth and educational opportunities, inequitable ownership of assets, limited mobility, and\noverall low cultural status. All of these findings indicate that, unless these trends are reversed or\nthe current population growth rate of 2.4 percent is lowered, Nepal\u2019s poverty situation is likely to\nworsen over time. The Poverty Analysis identified a number of factors that contribute to poverty\nin Nepal, including (i) slow overall economic growth in the face of relatively rapid population\ngrowth; (ii) weak Government redistributive and institutional capacity; (iii) non-agricultural growth\nlacking any significant spillover effects on the rural poor; (iv) low productivity and slow growth of\noutput  in  the  agriculture  sector;  and  (v)  weak  social  and  economic  infrastructure  (health,\neducation, drinking water, transport, energy, and problems relating to land ownership and land\nquality), leading to inadequate access of poor households to the means for escaping poverty. It\nis also recognized that poverty in Nepal has been exacerbated by cultural practices that have\ntended  to  exclude  women  and  other  disadvantaged  groups  from  the  full  benefits  of\ndevelopment. A meaningful poverty reduction strategy needs to improve performance in all of\nthese areas, while focusing on directly improving poor households\u2019 access to resources.\n14. The  Poverty  Analysis  and  proposed  approach  to  poverty  reduction  in  Nepal  were\ndiscussed at the High Level Forum on Poverty Reduction on 26 February 2001. The Forum\nstressed the crucial importance of improved governance as the key to Nepal\u2019s reform efforts.\nThe current Government\u2019s priorities, in addition to restoration of law and order, are tackling\ncorruption, and improved governance and civil service reform. There is also a need to reduce\nthe pervasive role of the central government and decentralize government responsibilities within\nthe context of a competitive market. The civil service suffers from institutional and human\nresource weaknesses. Frequent political changes have also disrupted the civil service and led\nto an increasing problem of politicization. The civil service needs to be reformed to enable it to\nbecome service oriented and to play a major role in effectively implementing the Government\u2019s\npoverty reduction strategy in an environment free from political interference. Corruption is also a\nkey constraint to effective delivery of essential services. Public financial management and\nresource  mobilization  are  also  weak  and  need  greater  efficiency,  transparency,  and  an\nintegrated system to link policy with planning to produce realistic budgets and development\nexpenditure targets. The Government, with external assistance, is introducing reforms in these\nareas, and ADB plans to continue to assist it in its governance reform program (including civil\nservice reform and anti-corruption efforts).\n15. The high level forum generally supported the findings of the Poverty Analysis, including\nthe  severity  of  poverty  in  Nepal,  the  strategy  for  poverty  reduction,  and  constraints  to\nimplementation of the strategy. Based on the results of the Poverty Analysis, the Government\nfinalized its Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy in May 2001. The Strategy will help set priorities\nfor the remainder of the Ninth Plan, will provide an overall framework to coordinate the poverty\nreduction efforts of various funding agencies, and is expected to be the foundation for the Tenth\nPlan.\n1.  Social Development\n16. Nepal  ranked  129th  out  of  162  countries  in  the  United  Nations  Development\nProgramme\u2019s (UNDP\u2019s) 2001 Human Development Report. The people in the poorest regions of\nthe country also have the lowest access to education and basic health services, highest rates of\n                  \n4  Nepal is divided into three geographic regions: the Terai (flat plains), middle hills, and mountains.", "5\ninfant mortality, and highest rates of child malnutrition. Poverty undermines efforts at promoting\nhuman development, since it prevents many parents from sending their children to school. The\ncurrent literacy rate among individuals age 6 and above is 38 percent (52 percent for males and\n24 percent for females). However, only 20 percent of the poor are literate compared with 60\npercent of those in the higher income groups. Human development has significant gender\ndifferences. While 32 percent of poor men are literate, the literacy rate of poor women is much\nlower at 9 percent. Illiteracy, malnutrition, and disease reduce development and employment\nopportunities, worsening poverty. The major challenge facing Nepal remains how to overcome\nthe low levels of human development and high population growth rate. The quality of service\ndelivery  needs  to  be  improved  to  increase  the  level  of  human  capital.  This  will  require\ninstitutional strengthening and training of service providers, including teachers. The need to\nprioritize  governance  and  social  development  interventions  to  address  these  challenges  is\nrecognized by the Government in its poverty reduction strategy.\n17. Women in Nepal are deprived and severely underprivileged in rural areas. Nepal ranks\n120th among 146 countries in UNDP's 1999 gender development index, published in 2001. The\nmaternal mortality rate of 540 per 100,000 live births is one of the highest in the Asia and Pacific\nregion. The gender empowerment measure, which reflects women\u2019s participation in economic,\npolitical, and professional spheres, was 0.191 in 1996 for Nepal, well below the average of\n0.367 for developing countries in that year.5 Gender disparity persists in educational attainment,\nhealth status, and participation in the decision-making process. Disadvantaged castes and\nethnic communities show higher levels of gender disparities in all areas. Efforts have been\nmade by the Government to close the gender gap and to improve the status of women through\nvarious development programs and activities funded by bilateral and multilateral agencies.\nHowever, the results of these efforts are likely to remain limited unless the gender bias in the\nsocial system is reduced, if not eliminated. The GRP also needs to address this issue.\nIV. THE SECTOR\nA.  Background and Recent Performance\n1.  Structure of the Civil Service\n18. Nepal\u2019s public sector consists of three subsectors: the central Government, local and\nmunicipal authorities, and state-owned enterprises. The central Government has 21 ministries, 9\nconstitutional bodies, and 108 development boards. There are 5 regional administrations, 75\ndistrict development committees, and 3,914 village development committees. There are 46\nstate-owned  enterprises.  The  civil  service  in  Nepal  was  originally  established  for  land\nadministration, collection of land revenue, maintenance of law and order, and dispensation of\njustice. In 1952, an administrative reform commission was constituted to streamline the civil\nservice, but remained on an ad hoc basis. The civil service was formalized with the passage of\nthe Civil Service Act of 1957 and the Civil Service Rules of 1975. The present civil service in\nNepal  is  governed  by  the  1993  Civil  Service  Act  and  Civil  Service  Rules.  In  May  1998,\nParliament again amended the Civil Service Act.\n19. The  Nepalese  civil  service  consists  of  ten  services:6  administrative;  agriculture;\neconomic,  planning,  and  statistical;  education;  engineering;  forest;  health;  judicial;\n                  \n5  The latest UNDP Human Development Report did not rank Nepal.\n6  The health service is governed by the Nepal Health Service Act (1996) while the other nine services are governed\nby the latest Civil Service Act promulgated in 1993.", "6\nmiscellaneous; and parliamentary. It does not include the military, police force, teachers, or staff\nof public enterprises and local authorities.7 The total size of Nepal\u2019s civil service is estimated at\n105,000  approved  posts,  of  which  about  90,000  are  currently  occupied.  Approximately  90\npercent of civil servants are in the nongazetted (support staff) class, and of this group, almost\n35 percent are cleaning staff and messengers. There are approximately 0.57 civil servants per\n100  population,  which  is  relatively  small  by  developing  country  standards,  particularly\nconsidering that only 10 percent of the civil servants are at officer level.8 In FY2001, personnel\nexpenditures  comprised  approximately  20  percent  of  the  total  Government  budget,  which\ncompares favorably with other developing countries (an average of 20-25 percent).\n20. MOGA is the government ministry charged with the responsibility for administering the\ncivil service rules and regulations, and is responsible for transfers and promotions within the civil\nservice. MOF is responsible for preparation and administration of the government budget, and is\ntherefore concerned with the level of civil service salaries and the overall wage bill. The Public\nService Commission (PSC), a constitutional body, and therefore regarded as independent, is\nresponsible for recruitment to the civil service, and is the guardian of the principle of merit-based\nrecruitment and promotion in the civil service. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of\nAuthority  (CIAA)  is  an  independent  constitutional  body  responsible  for  investigating  and\nrecommending for prosecution cases of abuse of authority in the public sector at the national\nlevel. The Special Police are responsible for investigating corruption cases at the district level.\nThe Auditor-General Office, a constitutional body, investigates irregularities in public sector\nexpenditure, and prepares annual reports on its findings.\n21. Women are a highly underrepresented group in the civil service, accounting for only\nabout 8.6 percent of total positions, 5.1 percent of officer level positions, and 8.9 percent of\nsupport staff positions. Affirmative action to redress the gender imbalance in the civil service is\nrequired. At present, there are only three women in the special class, the highest level within the\ncivil service, and 25 in class one, of whom 20 are in social sectors or non-administrative\npositions  (accounting for only 4 percent of the total staff in these two classes). During the\nperiod 1997-2000, one woman was promoted to class one, and the trend is similar at all levels,\nindicating that cultural stereotypes prevent the development of an environment that is conducive\nto the promotion of women or to women\u2019s interests.\n1.  Recent Performance\n22. Nepal has a lengthy history of weak implementation of public administrative reform.\nThere  were  five  administrative  reform  commissions  from  1952  to  1992.  The  1992\nCommissionmade 116 principal recommendations aimed at making the public service more\nefficient, results oriented, accountable, motivated, and capable. Key proposals included the\nimplementation of a 15-year development plan and a 5-year rolling plan, a reduction in the\nnumber of ministries from 21 to 18, \u201crightsizing\u201d of the bureaucracy, placement of certain\nfunctions (such as the postal service) under autonomous authority, and devolution of power to\nlocal bodies. Originally, it was estimated that three years would be necessary to implement all\nthe recommendations. However, many of them have yet to be implemented, although the\nGovernment has recently introduced a number of measures to streamline the bureaucracy (see\n                  \n7  Personnel in the military total about 50,000; the police force numbers about 60,000; and there are about 127,000\nteachers, approximately 55,000 staff of public enterprises, and 55,000 employees of development boards. These\npersonnel are not included in the number of civil servants, but have a significant impact on the Government\u2019s\noverall wage bill.\n8   India has 1.0 civil servants per 100 people; Pakistan, 1.5; and Sri Lanka, 4.5.", "7\nparas. 24-26). The main reason for the inability to implement the reforms was the short tenure of\nseven coalition governments from 1994 to 1999, prior to a majority government being elected.\n23. Prior  to  September  1998,  many  laws  including  some  form  of  decentralization  were\nproposed, and elections were held for local bodies at the village and district levels. However,\nlittle was achieved in terms of extending actual local autonomy, and decision-making remained\ncentralized. In September 1998, Parliament passed the Local Self-Governance Act. The extent\nof the resulting decentralization will depend on the central Government\u2019s willingness to delegate\nauthority  to  a  lower  administrative  and  political  level.  The  Government  announced  in  the\nFY2002 Budget Speech that in FY2002 it plans to devolve responsibility for primary education,\nagricultural extension, and health service delivery to the village level, putting these services\nunder  the  management  of  local  committees.  In  addition,  considerable  effort  is  needed  to\nstrengthen the capacity for policy, program, and project formulation and implementation at both\nthe central and local levels.\n24. More  recently,  even  prior  to  the  implementation  of  TA  3622  in  May  2001,  the\nGovernment showed its commitment to the reform program by taking a number of actions.\nSeveral  meetings  of  the  high-level  Administrative  Reforms  Coordination  and  Monitoring\nCommittee  (ARCMC,  chaired  by  the  Prime  Minister)  and  the  secretary-level  executive\ncommittee on the reforms (chaired by the minister, MOGA) have been held since November\n1999 to take decisions and guide the reform process. As an outcome of these meetings the\nnumber of ministries was reduced from 26 to 21 in mid-2000. Freezing of 5,000 vacant positions\nand abolition of 1,045 other positions was accomplished in FY2001, with savings of $2.4 million.\nIn addition, over 900 staff from the reserve pool were transferred to other offices. Permanent\nstaff are now being used in development projects instead of contract staff, and the number of\ntemporary positions has been reduced.\n25. In FY2001, a VERS was offered to civil servants. The scheme was limited to lower level\nnongazetted staff, and over 2,600 applied, of whom more than 98 percent were approved. The\npositions of those retired will be eliminated. The Government improved and decompressed\nwage scales, with salary increases from peon (office helper) to secretary (head civil servant in a\nministry) level of 50-88 percent, respectively. The compression ratio for wages increased from\n3.1 to 3.6 for salaries and from 2.9 to 3.3 for take-home pay. The Government also approved a\npolicy  of  not  creating  new  development  boards,  which  has  often  been  used  as  a  way  of\nincreasing staff numbers outside the civil service. Payroll consolidation and strengthening is\nalso being introduced. A review of the Civil Service Act amendments has also been undertaken\nwith the objective of streamlining and refining the Act. The effectiveness of the CIAA was\nstrengthened by the appointment of a new chief commissioner and senior staff in December\n2000, and it has started to show a degree of effectiveness and commitment by filing, in mid-\n2001, a high-profile case (among several others) against 10 senior individuals, including a\nformer minister. The Government has also presented three anticorruption bills or amendments\nto  Parliament  to  strengthen  the  anticorruption  legislative  framework.  The  Prevention  of\nCorruption Bill consolidates existing legislation; an amendment to the CIAA Act will strengthen\nCIAA\u2019s powers, including establishment of a specialized anticorruption court; and legislation on\nspecialized courts will allow the creation of this special anticorruption court. A Freedom of\nInformation Bill has been drafted to compel public representatives to declare assets; and a\nPolitical Parties Bill has been drafted requiring an annual financial audit of all political parties. In\nsummary, the Government has shown its commitment to governance reform through these\nactions.", "8\n26. A number of other significant reform actions have also been recently taken by the\nGovernment. MOGA established the Governance Reform Coordination Unit (GRCU) to form the\nnucleus  of  the  governance  reform  implementation  group,  with  the  Government\u2019s  strong\ncommitment to improving overall performance being reflected with the strengthening of senior\nstaff in MOGA to lead the reform program. The Prime Minister until recently also retained the\nMOGA portfolio because of the importance that is attached to the reform program. Change units\nled by senior staff have been formed in three key ministries\u2014Agriculture and Cooperatives\n(MOAC), Education and Sports (MOES), and Health (MOH)\u2014to implement the reform program.\nRegarding improvement in the overall efficiency of the civil service, in addition to the VERS,\npersonnel expenditures are being reduced, and the Public Expenditure Reforms Commission\nhas submitted a comprehensive report that the Government is committed to implement.\n27. In addition to many workshops held from June 1999 to April 2000, a series of workshops\nwith  key  stakeholders,  including  senior  bureaucrats,  politicians,  civil  society,  and  funding\nagencies, was held in mid-2000 to assist in raising the level of stakeholder ownership and\ncommitment to the governance reform process, and to discuss the scope of the program and\nrefine the policy matrix. Based on the workshops, in November 2000 the Government approved\na discussion paper that outlined the scope of the GRP and the draft policy matrix for the\nproposed program loan.\n28. The Government has continued the consultation process with key stakeholders through\na number of workshops since mid-2000. These have included senior bureaucrats, civil servants,\ncivil service unions, politicians, civil society, and aid agencies. The focus of discussions was\nreform priorities and addressing specific concerns about particular components of the reform\nprogram, including the need to increase the representation of females in the civil service. The\noverall objective of the consultations was to obtain further support for the reform process,\nparticularly from politicians. This appears to have been achieved, since all political parties,\nincluding the opposition party, have publicly indicated their strong commitment to governance\nreform. The consultations will continue as part of the GRP implementation process. Periodic\nmeetings with the all-party State Affairs Committee of Parliament to report on the status of GRP\nimplementation have been held and will continue to be held. Support for the reform process is\nalso  present  at  the  level  of  senior  civil  servants,  and  among  several  nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs) actively involved in advocating governance reform.\n3. Previous Assistance\n29. Preparation of an action plan on civil service reforms under TA 31179 began in June\n1999 and was completed in December 2000. The Executing Agency (EA) for the TA was\nMOGA. The TA was designed to lay the groundwork for broader reform efforts and to probe the\nseriousness of the Government\u2019s commitment to such a course of action. It used previous\nstudies,  especially  the  1992  Administrative  Reform  Commission  report  prepared  by  the\nGovernment.\n30. The  initiatives  under  the  TA  included  (i)  conducting  a  civil  service  census;  (ii)  the\nestablishment of a computerized personnel database; (iii) undertaking a functional review of\nministries,  departments,  and  offices  to  identify  areas  for  streamlining,  consolidation,  or\ndevolution; and (iv) considering a range of alternatives for fiscal decentralization.\n                  \n9 TA 3117-NEP: Formulating an Action Plan on Civil Service Reforms, for $630,000, approved on 14 December 1998.", "9\n31. The  functional  review  of  ministries  was  completed  as  planned.  Utilizing  ministry\nmanagement and staff teams working with the consultants, each ministry identified opportunities\nfor  change,  including  reorganization  of  priorities,  performance  reward  systems,  and\nperformance budgeting needs, which will be implemented during the GRP.\n32. The  Government  is  using  the  civil  service  census  data  prepared  under  the  TA  to\ncross-check its manual records, which are being computerized. The Government is in the\nprocess of linking the personnel database to its payroll. MOF issued an instruction that MOGA\nshould be provided with a record of all sanctioned and vacant positions and a list of names of\nstaff in the positions, and that salaries would not be paid to staff of offices that had not\nsubmitted the lists of sanctioned position holders in the civil service. All ministries complied with\nthe instruction with the exception of MOH, whose staff are in a different service from other civil\nservants. This action will effectively link personnel records with the payroll. The computerization\nof personnel records is targeted for completion by early 2002.\n33. The consultant team for TA 3622 was fielded on 14 May 2001. The TA is assisting the\nGovernment to move from the definition of its reform program, with which the previous TA 3117\nassisted, to continuing to introduce the first steps in its long-term reform program. The pressing\nneeds at the moment are (i) to strengthen the Government\u2019s capacity to implement the reforms;\nand (ii) to assist it in preparing policies and legislation, and in undertaking further reform actions.\nThe TA is strengthening GRCU within MOGA, and the Efficiency Unit within MOF that the\nGovernment has established to lead the reform process.\n34. TA  3622  is  assisting  the  Government  in  further  assessing  options  and  priorities  to\nimplement the reform program in the most efficient, cost-effective manner to achieve the desired\nobjectives. It is also contributing to broadening of the support base, and formation of a coalition\nin civil society to press for the reforms through stakeholder consultation and participation. The\nTA is supporting the Government in preparing for implementation of the program loan and has\nassisted the Government in meeting the proposed program loan\u2019s first tranche conditions. The\nTA will continue to support actions to meet the loan\u2019s second tranche conditions until October\n2002.\nA.  Constraints and Issues\n35.  Prior to 1999, a number of attempts were made to reform Nepal\u2019s civil service, but these\nwere largely unsuccessful (para. 22), which can be attributed to four main factors: (i) absence of\nserious political commitment; (ii) resistance from civil servants, (iii) lack of serious dialogue on\nreform opportunities with stakeholders outside the civil service, and (iv) lack of experience and\nappropriate skills to diagnose the real central issues, and develop a process for managing and\nimplementing the needed changes.\n36. Past lessons are clear. First, broad-based political commitment needs to be fostered if\npoliticians, especially legislators, are engaged in the process of deciding on reform priorities and\nsolutions.  Second,  resistance  among  bureaucrats  and  civil  service  trade  unions  must  be\novercome. Third, the Government needs to consult more widely with external stakeholders\nwithin  Nepal\u2014in  particular,  civil  society,  politicians,  the  private  sector,  and  academics\u2014to\ngenerate a wider range of options and support for reform. While consultations took place with\nexternal stakeholders during the process of developing the reform strategy, it is essential that\ncontinued participation of such groups is ensured in the process, to maintain the pressure for\nreform on the Government.", "10\n37. Perhaps the most important lesson, and hence the issue that has to be faced head on,\nand which is borne out by both international experience and the specifics of past efforts in\nNepal, is that a change management process, such as the one now contemplated for the\nNepalese civil service, must (i) be anchored around a reform agenda developed and owned by\nNepalese;  (ii)  address  central  and  cross-cutting  issues  at  the  heart  of  poor  management\nprocesses and suboptimal performance; (iii) improve the basic and specific skills needed for\nnew processes and new ways of doing business; (iv) be implemented by the civil servants\nthemselves, towards agreed upon and stated ends that positively impact the general populace;\nand (v) be supported and demanded from both inside the bureaucracy and the population at\nlarge.  The  current  government\u2019s  commitment  to  reform,  senior  bureaucrats\u2019  realization  of\ninefficiencies, and their willingness to seek systemic changes and to open a dialogue with\nstakeholders are positive signs that provide an impetus for change. The provision of TA to\ndevelop capacity to manage and implement change will reinforce this situation.\n38.  The principal constraints to operation of an efficient, service-oriented civil service are\nsummarized in paras. 39-44.\n1.  Fiscal Problems\n39. The Government must take decisive action to improve its internal efficiency before it can\nstart  to  build  a  civil  service  that  is  capable  of  delivering  better  services.  While  wage  bill\npressures have in the past been relatively weak, the FY2001 pay increases that ranged from 50\nto 88 percent have put further pressure on the substantially underfunded operating budgets for\nkey government services. In addition, the new civil service pay levels were introduced without\nfirst shifting resources towards nonwage operational expenditures, and achieving fiscal savings\nin a situation in which no significant growth in government revenues can be anticipated in the\nshort term.\n40. Also, the public service wage bill lacks transparency, since personnel expenditures\nappear both in the development and regular budget, and the number of civil servants engaged\nis  not  closely  related  to  the  number  of  approved  establishment  posts.  Civil  servants  are\nengaged on the development budget on temporary terms for so-called \u201cproject\u201d posts, even\nthough in many instances these are regular line positions.10 Similarly, teachers (who are not in\nthe civil service) are hired, often on temporary terms, based upon pupil enrollment figures that\nare widely recognized as inflated. It requires a commitment at both the political and bureaucratic\nlevels to make any significant progress in controlling the public service wage bill, including the\nteacher wage bill.\n41. The purposes of instituting stronger wage bill and establishment controls are to (i)\nreduce substantially the number of temporary civil servants, and (ii) ensure that all new staff\nrecruited  fill  a  vacant  post  that  has  been  properly  authorized.  The  development  of  a\ncomputer-based personnel information system that can be linked to established posts and the\ncivil service payroll is central to the second purpose.\n1.  Corruption\n42. Corruption is a systemic problem that undermines the performance of the bureaucracy\nand the Government as a whole. The current Prime Minister has announced his determination\n                  \n10 The Government has recently reduced over 1,100 existing positions, shifted redundant staff, and reduced the\nnumber of temporary posts, but these reforms need to be broader to achieve significant efficiencies.", "11\nto tackle the problem of institutionalized corruption. Corruption is manifested in a variety of\ntransactions. These practices are fed by, if not caused by, the relatively low pay levels of civil\nservants. While the recent pay increases may have some mitigating impact on the incidence of\ncorruption, more direct interventions to reduce corruption are essential in the short term. The\npresent enforcement mechanisms are weak, and the legislative framework for preventing and\ncontrolling  corruption  in  the  past  was  inadequate,  but  recently  proposed  legislation  will\nstrengthen the framework. Both are priority areas that must continue to be addressed. Civil\nsociety needs to be fully involved in discussing the anticorruption program, and a coalition of\nstakeholders needs to be built, both within and outside government, to push for reform in this\narea, and for governance reform generally. New draft bills to control corruption and establish\nspecial  courts  to  hear  corruption  cases,  combined  with  strong  leadership  and  qualified\npersonnel at the CIAA are encouraging signs.\n1.  Low Staff Productivity and Morale\n43. During the past decade there has been a marked deterioration in the productivity of the\ncivil service, and staff morale is very low. The causes of this situation are complex, including (i)\npolitical interference in appointments and placements; (ii) noncompliance with the principle of\nmeritocracy in promotion; (iii) opportunities for corruption that divert attention from official job\nfunctions; (iv) restricted training opportunities combined with training that is not job-related; (v) a\nfailure to attract the best qualified persons, partly due to low pay; (vi) salary levels that do not\nmeet basic living requirements; and (vii) ineffective staff appraisal systems. To the extent that\nthe GRP is equitably applied and good performers are rewarded, it will go a long way towards\nreducing such motivational problems.\n1.  Performance and Service Issues\n44. Although in recent years some sector ministries have made efforts to provide better\nservices, these efforts have tended to be piecemeal. Bureaucrats tend to give first priority to\nprocedures and paperwork, rather than being open and accessible to the public they serve, and\noriented to providing needed services. Most of the work undertaken by senior civil servants\nremains nontransparent and is rarely communicated to the public. It is imperative that the\nGovernment improve the performance of its ministries, but this must be achieved in the most\neffective and appropriate manner and must take account of certain difficulties currently faced,\nsuch as the gender imbalance. The Government in the FY2001and FY2002 Budget Speeches\nstated unequivocally that Nepal needs a civil service that is both results- and people-oriented. A\ncoherent approach to improving the performance of Nepal\u2019s civil service is now required that will\ninclude giving the public a voice in determining the services that are desired and how they will\nbe delivered. This approach must involve (i) extensive stakeholder consultation to refine and\nparticipate  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  new  approach;  (ii)  new  management\npractices and techniques, such as results-oriented management, performance contracting, and\nperformance budgeting (as have been successfully applied elsewhere in Asia); and (iii) specific\ntraining that is oriented to the development of skills needed for the new ways of doing business.\nHowever, the specific methodologies, techniques, and internal processes to be used will need to\nbe carefully tailored to Nepal\u2019s circumstances and management culture, and developed and\nowned by senior civil servants, managers, and staff, if needed reform changes are to take hold\nover  the  longer  term.  Such  changes  require  the  continuous  commitment  of  successive\ngovernments  and  senior  bureaucrats  and  necessitate  an  environment  where  provision  of\nappropriate performance and service levels is reinforced over time.", "12\nA.  Government Objectives and Strategy\n45. The vision for Nepal\u2019s governance reforms is to create a civil service that is both results-\nand people-oriented, and gender responsive. Such a civil service will be both efficient and\nultimately focused on providing better public services for its clients. The reforms will contribute\nto a redefinition of the role of government, focusing on facilitation and regulation within a\ncompetitive market economy. This vision will be realized only in the long term, over a period of\nperhaps 10-15 years, and will require sustained external support throughout that period.\n1.  First Phase of Reform (2001-2005)\n46. The objectives of the first four-year phase of the reform program, which is already being\nimplemented, are to introduce interrelated interventions that will catalyze and begin to effect\nfundamental changes in the civil service and governance environment. It will focus on the critical\ninstitutional constraints that cut across the whole of the civil service\u2014such as issues of pay and\nhuman resource development\u2014and it will specifically pilot techniques and approaches for doing\nbusiness in a whole new way with the ultimate objective of improved service delivery in five key\nministries  (MOGA,  MOF,  MOAC,  MOES,  and  MOH).  These  interventions  will  need  to  be\nsupported  by  complementary  actions  to  strengthen  the  budget  process  and  to  mobilize\nrevenues more effectively. In subsequent reform phases, improved performance will be adopted\non a wider scale throughout the civil service.\n47. To ensure that the reform initiatives are implemented effectively and in a sequenced\nmanner, effective mechanisms and structures for leading, supporting, and managing reform at a\nnumber of levels of government are a necessary first step in the reform process. Since political\ncommitment is indispensable to reform, leadership must be centered on the Cabinet- and\nsecretary-level governance reform committees that have already been established (see para. 74\nfor the composition of the committees). Developing an internal capability for leading reform is\nviewed as an integral part of this reform process. This will involve strengthening of GRCU within\nMOGA, the Efficiency Unit in MOF, and the change management units in the three pilot line\nministries, MOAC, MOES, and MOH.\n48. The  second  step  of  the  governance  reforms  will  focus  on  freeing  up  resources  to\nenhance pay and to increase the proportion of operating expenditures in the regular budget.\nAppropriate measures would include stronger wage bill controls, reductions in establishment\nposts and staff, transfer and devolution of functions to the private sector and local authorities,\nimproved record management, and revised pay policies. The primary focus for implementation\nof this set of actions will be MOGA and MOF.\n49. A third necessary step to professionalize and motivate the civil service will include\nactions to develop leadership and management qualities of senior civil servants, to recruit\ntalented staff, to enhance pay levels, and to redress the gender imbalance in the service.\nCoupled with appropriate tools and materials provided through a larger operating budget, civil\nservants should be better equipped to perform well. The focal point will be MOGA as the agency\nleading the reform process.\n50. The fourth step will be to inject into pilot ministries a robust but simple performance\nimprovement process to assist them to provide better services, again led by MOGA. The\nestablishment of effective processes for improving the performance of the civil service will be\nimplemented through two central ministries (MOGA and MOF) and introduced first in three key\nservice delivery ministries\u2014MOAC, MOES, and MOH\u2014which are most visible and important to", "13\nall Nepalese citizens because the services being provided are basic to their survival and to\npoverty reduction. In addition, these are the three ministries chosen in the FY2002 Budget\nSpeech as targets for devolution of functions to local authorities, a process that the GRP would\nsupport.  The  emphasis  in  introducing  performance  improvement  will  be  on  continuous\nimprovement  rather  than  the  achievement  of  arbitrary  performance  targets.  Tailored\ninterventions to enhance staff skills and improve business processes will be built into the\nperformance  plans  and  will  help  underpin  the  delivery  of  improved  and  specified  service\nstandards.  These  will  need  to  be  accompanied  by  improvements  in  budget  planning  and\nimplementation.  Performance  incentive  funds  will  be  established  to  reward  ministries  that\nsuccessfully improve performance, based on agreed upon criteria.\n51. Linked to the fourth step concerned with performance improvement, a fifth crosscutting\nstep is the need to reduce corruption, for which the focal point will be CIAA and other concerned\nagencies engaged in anticorruption actions. Anticorruption activities will focus on passage of\nlegislation to strengthen efforts to prevent corruption; on enforcement of anticorruption laws; and\non institution building in key anticorruption agencies, particularly CIAA. Existing provisions for\nasset and income declarations by elected public representatives and civil servants will be\nenforced, and new provisions introduced as required. A public awareness program to inform the\npublic of the role of anticorruption agencies and how to report corruption will be introduced. A\nschematic figure outlining the key steps and the objectives of the reform process is contained in\nAppendix 1.\n2. Subsequent Phases of Reform\n52. The actual details of how the vision for achieving the goal of the GRP will evolve will\nemerge through a process approach. However, in this subsection the manner in which the\nreforms might be implemented is described. If the first phase of reform succeeds in beginning\nthe  process  of  creating  a  more  efficient,  capable,  and  motivated  civil  service,  subsequent\nphases would concentrate on introducing to other ministries the new approaches to improved\nperformance first tested in MOGA, MOF, and the three pilot service delivery ministries (MOAC,\nMOES, and MOH). Over time the senior management teams in all ministries and departments\nwould be able to execute these processes without the need for support from GRCU in MOGA.\nThe role of GRCU would change to one of establishing the basic principles for managing\nperformance and their subsequent monitoring to ensure consistent application throughout the\ncivil service. The earlier focus of performance improvement on departments and divisions would\ncascade  down  to  work  teams  and  individuals;  perhaps  involving  group  or  individual\nperformance-related pay.\n53. In future phases of the GRP, it is envisaged that government\u2019s service delivery functions\nwould increasingly be delegated to corporate agencies operating at arms length from their\nparent ministries, the private sector, or local authorities, leaving central Government with largely\npolicy-making and regulatory functions, consistent with the envisioned government role in the\nGRP. The long-term objective would be that such service providers would be more flexible, and\nable to respond quickly to the demands of their clients. They would adapt modern management\nmethods to local cultural values, possibly including performance budgeting techniques. Local\nauthorities assuming responsibility for devolved service delivery would require considerable\nlong-term  capacity  building  to  assume  these  functions  under  a  decentralized  government\nstructure.", "14\nA.  External Assistance to the Sector\n54. External assistance in the governance sector has been broad and generally focused on\ncivil service reform, strengthening local governance and decentralization, public expenditure\nmanagement, and financial sector reform including privatization. Almost all of this assistance\nhas been grant financed except the ADB and World Bank assistance in the financial sector,\nwhich  are  loan  financed.  Most  of  the  assistance  by  other  agencies  is  focused  on  local\ngovernance and decentralization, generally aiming to strengthen the capacity of local governing\nbodies  and  community-based  organizations  to  plan,  implement,  monitor,  and  coordinate\ndevelopment work in which local initiatives are integrated.\n55. Assistance of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the financial\nsector is focused on reforms to improve the efficiency of the financial sector in general, and\nmanagement and performance of key financial institutions in particular. IMF is preparing for\npossible approval in 2002 of a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility that will emphasize\nimproved banking supervision and commercial bank reforms. The structural policy matrix for the\nFacility contains a number of reform conditions based on conditions for the proposed GRP loan.\n56. The World Bank supported the work of the Administrative Reform Commission in the\nearly 1990s that made a number of recommendations for improving the effectiveness and\nefficiency of the civil service. It also conducted a series of comprehensive studies on Public\nExpenditure Management in the mid-1990s and more recently supported the Government\u2019s own\nPublic  Expenditure  Review  and  reform  initiatives  to  rationalize  and  streamline  public\nexpenditure. The World Bank is preparing a Poverty Reduction Support Credit for possible\napproval in 2001, which also focuses on implementation of the recommendations of the Public\nExpenditure  Review  Commission,  and  therefore  has  conditions  supportive  of  civil  service\nreform. The World Bank is preparing a Country Procurement Assessment Report that will\ncontain an action plan to make procurement more transparent and efficient. ADB, through the\njoint Country Portfolio Review Mission with the World Bank and the Japan Bank for International\nCooperation, is supporting this initiative, which will lead to annual procurement plans for all\nprojects  and  to  preparation  of  public  procurement  legislation  to  improve  governance  in\ngovernment procurement.\n57. Since the mid-1990s UNDP has been supporting the Government\u2019s decentralization\nefforts  though  the  Participatory  District  Development  Program  and  the  Local  Governance\nProgram,  covering  a  total  of  60  of  the  75  districts.  Since  1998,  Danish  International\nDevelopment Assistance (DANIDA) has been supporting a wide range of good governance\ninitiatives under its Human Rights, Good Governance and Decentralization Program. DANIDA\nhas also been providing, since 1999, support for the decentralization process. The recently\nlaunched  United  Kingdom  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID)-supported\nEnabling  State  Program  seeks  to  promote  pro-poor  governance  by  addressing  the  twin\nproblems of practical understanding of governance problems and the creation of a desire for\nchange  among  key  power  holders.  Additionally,  DFID  has  supported  the  Government\u2019s\nprivatization program aimed at privatizing selected public enterprises; and capacity building of\nNGOs  and  community-based  organizations  in  selected  districts  through  its  Participatory\nLearning and Advisory Project. Since 1998, the Netherlands Development Organization has\nbeen providing assistance for strengthening the capacity of local governments and community-\nbased organizations for transparent bottom-up planning and coordinating development efforts.\nThe  Swiss  Agency  for  International  Development  and  Cooperation  (SDC)  is  supporting  a\nnumber  of  governance-related  interventions  including  strengthening  of  local  government\ncapacity, making public decision-making more transparent by promoting adoption of an integrity", "15\ncode  and  civil  society  coalitions  to  advocate  transparency,  and  building  the  capacity  of\ncommunity-based organizations and citizens to advocate governance reform. These activities\nare closely related to proposed GRP activities, and close coordination with SDC has been\nmaintained and will be continued.\nA.  ADB Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n1.  ADB Operations\n58. Based on the priorities enunciated in the 1999 Nepal Country Operational Strategy, the\nrecent Poverty Analysis, the Government\u2019s Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy, and the High\nLevel Poverty Reduction Forum held in Kathmandu on 26 February 2001, the overarching\nobjective of ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update is to achieve a sustainable reduction\nin poverty through (i) generation of productive employment opportunities and increased rural\nincomes  resulting  from  faster  and  broad-based  propoor  economic  growth,  (ii)  equitable\nimprovements  in  basic  social  services  to  enhance  human  development,  and  (iii)  good\ngovernance.\n59. Priorities  that  emerged  from  the  Poverty  Analysis  and  High  Level  Poverty  Forum\nincluded  (i)  the  need  to  achieve  broad-based  growth  through  employment  promotion  and\nimproved productivity, with emphasis on the agriculture sector; (ii) the need for macroeconomic\npolicies and reforms to support poverty reduction programs; (iii) social sector development; (iv)\ntargeted programs for excluded groups, particularly women; (v) improved public expenditure\nmanagement; (vi) improved governance; and (vii) improved poverty assessment and monitoring.\nADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program seeks to focus on some of the key priorities identified.\n60. ADB  has  introduced  a  performance-based  allocation  system  to  allocate  Asian\nDevelopment Fund resources to eligible developing member countries. The system measures\ncountry performance in 19 areas, including governance and public sector management. The\nsystem  also  assesses  performance  related  to  country-specific  criteria.  For  Nepal,  specific\ncriteria have been included to assess progress on governance reform. The World Bank\u2019s Nepal\nCountry Assistance Strategy also ties future lending levels, among other indicators, to progress\non governance reform. Governance is a key element of DFID\u2019s Country Strategy Paper. Several\nother  aid  agencies  include  good  governance  as  a  critical  issue  in  their  current  country\nstrategies. Working with other development partners, ADB will support the Government\u2019s efforts\nto implement institutional development strategies and the GRP endorsed in the Ninth Plan, and\nthe discussion paper on the GRP approved by the Government in 2000.\n61. Apart from the ongoing commitment to assist the Government with civil service reform\nand governance programs, ADB has previously assisted the Government of Nepal with program\nloans in the agriculture sector, including loans for crop intensification, agriculture, and forestry.\nADB\u2019s recent Agriculture Program Loan11 sought to address policy and institutional impediments\nto realizing the planned increase in agricultural productivity under the Agricultural Perspective\nPlan.  The  program  included  liberalization  of  fertilizer  trade  and  reduction  in  distortions  in\nirrigation, food grain marketing, and rural finance. The Industrial Sector Program Loan12 was\nalso provided to create a policy environment to increase the efficiency of the industry sector.\nThe program supported increased reliance on market forces and increased participation of the\nprivate  sector  in  the  industrial  development  of  the  country.  In  sectors  such  as  finance,\n                  \n11 Loan 1604-NEP: Second Agriculture Program, for $50 million, approved on 22 January 1998.\n12 Loan 1229-NEP: Industrial Sector Program, for $20.6 million, approved on 27 April 1993.", "16\neducation,  transport,  environment,  water  supply,  and  energy,  ADB  assistance  and  policy\ndialogue have sought to introduce sector reforms to increase the effectiveness of government\nservice delivery; legal, institutional and regulatory environments; and private sector participation,\nincluding beneficiaries, in the sectors.\n2. ADB Experiences and Lessons Learned\n62. ADB\u2019s experience with program lending in its member countries has had mixed results.\nOf the 37 program loans with completed program performance audit reports (PPARs), 10 have\nbeen rated as generally successful, 25 as partly successful, 1 as unsuccessful, and 1 was not\nrated. For public sector loans to Nepal, the results have also been mixed. Of the 37 loans with\nPPARs, 19 were rated as generally successful, 10 as partly successful, and 8 as unsuccessful.\nOf the 37 loans to Nepal with PPARs, 4 were program loans. One was rated as successful, and\nthree were rated partly successful. The Crop Intensification Program loan13 was considered\nsuccessful because increases in productivity and incomes in the program area were achieved.\nA partly successful rating was given to the Second Crop Intensification Program loan14 because\npolicy reform and institutional development objectives were not achieved during the period of\nthe program. A partly successful assessment was given to the Agriculture Program15 because\nthe design lacked a detailed analysis of the fertilizer subsector. The Forestry Sector Program16\nwas rated partly successful because there was ineffective implementation of the policy reform\nand  investment  components.  The  most  recent  program  loan  in  Nepal  was  the  Second\nAgriculture Program. Performance on this loan was relatively satisfactory, with the Government\nhaving taken a number of difficult policy decisions regarding elimination of agricultural subsidies,\nand having fulfilled by June 2000 the conditions for release of the second tranche.\n63. ADB  has  implemented  several  public  sector  reform  programs,  primarily  in  Pacific\ndeveloping member countries. The major lessons learned from these programs, and from a\nlarge number of reform programs funded by other agencies, including the World Bank, are\nsummarized  here.  Perhaps  the  most  important  factor  contributing  to  a  successful  reform\nprogram  is  political  commitment  and  ownership.  Successful  reform  programs  must  be\ndeveloped  by  and  owned  by  governments  rather  than  being  externally  driven.  Political\ncommitment is required both from government itself, at the cabinet level, and from opposition\nparties, to ensure that there is broad support for reform programs. This is required because\nreform programs introduce major changes in the way the Government operates, and directly\naffect the careers and prospects of civil servants at all levels of the bureaucracy. Government,\nincluding the civil service, needs to take the lead in this dialogue and convince civil society,\nparliament, and the public of their commitment to a reform program.\n64.  Civil service reform is a long-term process, and requires a commitment over a period of\nten years or more to achieve lasting change. Sustaining commitment over an extended period\nuntil tangible results of the reform process begin to emerge is difficult, and key stakeholders\nmay become impatient if results are not immediately visible. This requires careful program\ndesign, to ensure that easier reforms that produce quick and visible results are combined with\nthe  longer  term,  more  difficult  reforms,  to  maintain  broad  support  for  the  reform  process.\nAppropriate reward mechanisms must be made available to those who champion and lead\nreforms successfully. More importantly, to generate such broad support, it is critical that key\n                  \n13 Loan 559-NEP: Crop Intensification Program, for $4 million, approved on 15 December 1981.\n14 Loan 669-NEP: Second Crop Intensification Program, for $15 million, approved on 14 December 1983.\n15 Loan 924-NEP: Agriculture Program, for $55 million, approved on 24 November 1988.\n16 Loan 1040-NEP: Forestry Sector Program, for $40 million, approved on 23 October 1990.", "17\nstakeholders be involved in the design of a reform program, and that they are fully consulted\nand participate in implementation. By raising public awareness and building advocacy coalitions,\nadopting a transparent process of information sharing, and involving stakeholders, support for\nreforms is developed, and government commitment to them is increased.\n65. Care needs to be taken in the design of reform programs to ensure that the scope is\nappropriate to the capacity and needs of the country. The use of a blueprint technical approach\nso often found in reform programs around the world has in most cases failed. The program\nscope needs to be simple, achievable, and not too ambitious in terms of its targets. The\nobjectives  of  the  reform  program  need  to  be  clearly  specified,  with  monitorable  progress\nindicators and well-defined responsibilities among implementing agencies. Reform programs\noften consist of various levels of activity, including inputs, processes, outputs, and impacts.\nWhile success in implementing a program at all levels is required, there needs to be a constant\nfocus on impacts. The end result of a reform program must be clear evidence to the public that\nthe reforms have produced benefits in the form of better service provision and other intended\nprogram impacts.\n66. Related  to  the  need  for  careful  program  design  is  the  need  to  phase  the  reforms\ncarefully and realistically. The capacity and culture of the civil service need to be taken into\naccount. The key principles are to keep the program relatively simple, implement a limited\nnumber  of  significant  reforms  at  a  time,  carefully  plan  the  phasing  of  reforms  with  full\nstakeholder participation, and allow for flexibility to test and make adjustments as needed. The\nphasing  of  reform  actions  must,  of  course,  result  in  tangible  and  specified  outcomes  and\nimpacts. Subsequent phases would then only follow if the initial stage has been successful.\n67. Finally, the operating culture of the bureaucracy and politicians, and its impact on the\nway in which the civil service operates need to be taken into account. This requires a careful\nanalysis of the institutional context in which the reforms will be introduced. Reform interventions\nneed to be realistic, taking into account the prevailing institutional system, and need to take\nadvantage of the strengths in the system while mitigating its weaknesses.\nV. THE REFORM PROGRAM\nA.  Rationale\n68. A  major  difficulty  in  achieving  development  effectiveness  in  Nepal  is  the  lack  of\nefficiency,  predictability,  transparency,  and  accountability  in  key  government  institutions.\nCapacity building for improved governance is a critical factor for achieving the Government\u2019s\noverarching  goal  of  sustainable  poverty  reduction.  Lack  of  support  and  political  instability\ncontributed in the recent past to failed reform efforts.  Currently, governance reform is a key\nelement of the Government\u2019s broader economic and structural reform program, which seeks to\nsustain accelerated growth and economic stability.\n69. Poor  public  sector  governance  has  contributed  to  a  demoralized  bureaucracy,\ninappropriate allocation of budget resources, and ineffective implementation of development\nprograms.  There  are  increasing  allegations  of  corruption  at  many  levels,  and  corruption\nrepresents a key constraint to the effective delivery of essential services. Basic institutions\nessential to the effective functioning of a market economy do not exist or do not operate\neffectively. Poor governance and the unsustainable financial performance of public agencies\nwaste limited public resources, affect the quality and quantity of public and private investment,\nconstrain  the  level  of  economic  growth,  and  weaken  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction", "18\nprogram. The civil service also suffers from a significant gender imbalance. The GRP will seek\nto remove administrative, financial, and gender weaknesses in the civil service by introducing\ninstitutional reforms to improve transparency, accountability, predictability, and processes for\nredressing gender imbalance.\n70. By extending a governance reform loan, ADB will provide much needed support for the\npublic administration institution-building process in Nepal. ADB is an appropriate agency to\nsupport governance reforms in Nepal because of previous and ongoing support in this area and\nbecause many of ADB\u2019s loans and TAs include components seeking to improve governance\nand service delivery. Accordingly, ADB has acquired considerable experience in this area. Also,\nbuilding effective institutions is the strategic approach of ADB operations in Nepal. ADB has\nalready provided two TAs to assist the Government in developing and implementing the reform\nprogram. Governance reform will require continuing commitment and follow-up support from\nADB and other aid agencies throughout this period to achieve the ultimate goal of the GRP.\nADB  has  the  appropriate  assistance  modality  (program  lending)  to  implement  governance\nreforms in conjunction with TA from other agencies for institutional support to implement the\nreform program. While different lending modalities were considered for this loan, including a\nprogram cluster modality, it is felt that a program loan with three tranches for the first phase of\nthe reform program is appropriate, rather than a program loan with only one or two tranches, for\nwhich long-term commitment to reform might be lacking. The timing of tranche releases will be\nflexible, and contingent upon the Government\u2019s capacity and continued commitment to the\nreforms. The specific nature of tranche conditions is also somewhat flexible, since details of\nsome  tranche  conditions  will  be  developed  during  the  implementation  period,  with  the\nassistance of TA consultants.\n71. As  mentioned  in  paras.  54-57,  the  GRP  supports  the  governance  priorities  and\nobjectives  of  a  number  of  external  funding  agencies.  Their  support  for  governance\nimprovements  is  predicated  on  the  assumption  that  ADB  will  take  the  lead  in  providing\nassistance for governance reform. ADB\u2019s assistance for corporate and financial governance17 is\nrelated to the governance reform program and is part of ADB\u2019s overall strategy to improve\ngovernance in Nepal and build effective institutions to support sustainable development.\nA.  Objectives and Scope\n72. The overall goal of the governance reform program is to establish a civil service that is\nresults- and people-oriented and gender responsive. Such a civil service will contribute to higher\neconomic growth and poverty reduction. The objectives of the program are to (i) develop an\ninternal capacity within the Government to lead and undertake the governance reform agenda,\n(ii) improve the efficiency of the civil service, (iii) improve governance and ensure that corruption\nin  government  is  effectively  prosecuted  under  the  law,  (iv)  enhance  the  competence  and\nmotivation  of  civil  servants,  and  (v)  establish  processes  for  improving  performance  in  key\nministries. The underlying logic, based on past experience with reform within the Nepalese civil\nservice, and supported by international experience, is that the program objectives need to be\nlimited  and  clearly  defined;  must  be  carefully  sequenced  to  build  on  each  other  (see\nAppendix 1); must address some of the central, core constraints to performance; and must allow\nfor  experimentation,  including  entirely  new  ways  of  doing  business.  This  flexible  process\napproach requires that details of many elements of the reform program will only emerge as the\n                  \n17 Loan 1811-NEP: Corporate and Financial Governance Project, for $7.3 million, approved on 14 December 2000;\nand  TA  3580-NEP: Strengthening Corporate and Financial Governance,  for  $3.3  million,  approved  on  14\nDecember 2000.", "19\nprogram is being implemented, with the support of TA consultants. Accordingly, the program\nframework and policy matrix should not be regarded as blueprints. As the reform program is\nimplemented, details of some required actions will be developed, and some tranche conditions\nmay also have to be adapted to evolving circumstances, upon the mutual agreement of ADB\nand the Government.\nA.  Policy Framework and Actions\n73. Implementation of the action plan under the program will include a number of policy and\ninstitutional reforms to improve the performance of the civil service. The program framework is\nprovided in Appendix 2. The reform policies and actions are summarized in the draft Policy\nMatrix and Development Policy Letter (Appendix 3). The five proposed components of the\nreform program and related actions are described in this section.\n1. Develop an Internal Capacity for Leading Reform\n74. The  Government\u2019s  ambitious  and  broad  GRP  will  require  strong  leadership  and\nmanagement at both the political and bureaucratic levels. Senior politicians and bureaucrats\ntogether need to lead and reinforce improvement on key government management structures\nand processes for leading and supporting the reform effort. The objective of this component of\nthe GRP is to improve these key management structures for leading and supporting the reform\neffort. As part of its ongoing reform initiatives, the Government has already put these structures\nin  place.  A  principal  element  of  this  component  will  be  to  maintain  an  effective  cabinet\nsubcommittee (ARCMC, see para. 24)18 and secretary-level executive committee19 to provide\nstrategic leadership for the reform program. ARCMC has already been expanded to include\nministers  from  key  service  delivery  ministries  such  as  health,  education,  agriculture,  and\nwomen. The minister of MOGA is directing the executive committee, which has been expanded\nto include secretaries of the same ministries represented in ARCMC.\n75. Further, GRCU in MOGA and the Efficiency Unit in MOF have been established and\nstaffed  as  change  units  to  coordinate,  direct,  and  support  reforms  in  other  ministries  and\ndepartments. Change management units have also been established and consolidated in the\nthree line ministries (MOAC, MOES, and MOH) responsible for implementing the reforms. The\ncabinet subcommittee and the executive committee will set policies, and the change units in\nMOGA, MOF, and the three pilot ministries will be responsible for implementing them. The\nexecutive committee will review and approve the annual progress of the GRP and prepare an\nannual  public  report  that  includes  information  on  the  Government\u2019s  success  in  increasing\nwomen\u2019s  representation  in  the  civil  service.  Appendix  4  depicts  these  implementation\narrangements.\n76. A clearly articulated strategy and gender sensitive annual action plans to guide the GRP,\nbased on the policy matrix conditionalities and required outputs and actions contained in the\nprogram framework, will be developed and implemented by GRCU, the Efficiency Unit in MOF,\nand the three change units in MOAC, MOES, and MOH. The plans will include tactics and\n                  \n18 Chaired by the Prime Minister, with membership including the minister of General Administration; the ministers of\nFinance, Agriculture and Cooperatives, Education and Sports, Health, Women Children and Social Welfare;\nchairman of PSC; vice-chairman of the National Planning Commission; chief secretary; and joint secretary of the\nMonitoring Division in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office as member secretary.\n19 Chaired by the minister of General Administration, with membership including the chief secretary, secretaries of\nCIAA, MOAC, MOES, MOF, MOGA, MOH, Law and Justice, National Planning Commission, PSC, Prime Minister\u2019s\nOffice, Women Children and Social Welfare, and joint secretary of MOGA as member secretary.", "20\nsequencing  of  actions  to  support  the  implementation  of  governance  reforms  by  building\nconsensus.  The  executive  committee  has  approved  the  first  year\u2019s  overall  reform\nimplementation plan as a first tranche condition. There will be several main outputs of the first\ncomponent to develop an internal leadership capability for reform. These include the processes\nfor implementing the reform program, reviewing progress, consulting with stakeholders, and\nreporting.\n77. International experience in governance reform has shown that strong commitment of\ngovernment and key stakeholders to the reform process, and the success of reform efforts, are\nreinforced by meaningful involvement of civil society in the design and implementation of reform\nprograms. For this reason support will be provided for public awareness campaigns and other\nactivities  to  help  quickly  foster  broad-based  support  for  governance  reform  in  Nepal.  The\nsupport will target key stakeholders, including politicians, civil service unions, nongovernment\nand other civil society organizations, the media, academia, and the general public. GRCU,\nsupported by TA, will work continuously with civil society and NGOs active in the governance\narea  to  build  a  coalition  advocating  reform,  and  to  obtain  feedback  on  the  program\u2019s\nimplementation. GRCU will also keep the public informed of developments concerning the GRP.\nIn essence, this component seeks to put in place the structures and leadership within and\noutside government by which sequenced governance reform actions as defined in the GRP are\nadvocated and implemented. In addition, an independent NGO or individual under TA support\nwill monitor GRP implementation and provide and publicize reports on results achieved.\n2. Improve the Efficiency of the Civil Service\n78. The objective of this component is to generate as quickly as possible the fiscal savings\nby \u201crightsizing\u201d government and improving personnel management processes and systems to\nsupport enhanced performance and outcomes. A combination of measures will be required to\ngenerate quickly the efficiency gains needed to improve the remuneration levels of civil servants\n(part of component 4), since it is very unlikely that any one action will produce the volume of\nfiscal savings required. One of the key outputs of this component will be to reduce personnel\nlevels and expenditures directly by attrition, and through targeted redundancy schemes as early\nas possible.  As a second tranche condition, the Efficiency Unit in MOF and GRCU will review\nand refine financial scenarios and conditions of the existing VERS to develop an affordable and\nfinancially viable VERS for government approval and submission of amendments to the Civil\nService Act to Parliament.\n79. Based on the functional review work of all ministries previously completed under TA\n3117, prior to the second tranche GRCU, the MOF Efficiency Unit, and the pilot ministry change\nunits will prepare a gender-sensitive policy and detailed plans for approval by the executive\ncommittee to abolish, contract out, privatize, or delegate noncore functions of government to\nrelevant agencies, including functions such as driving senior officials and maintenance. Some\nkey functions such as agricultural extension, primary education, and health services will also be\ndevolved to local authorities starting in FY2002. Consultations will be held with key stakeholders\nincluding politicians, civil society, business, and civil service unions to present the model and\nrationale for devolving noncore functions and the type of transactions, scope, and proposed\ntiming. A framework for regulating and monitoring devolved noncore functions will be put in\nplace. Establishing and implementing a program for restructuring the civil service around its\ncore activities will not only help achieve quick efficiency gains through \u201crightsizing\u201d to gain\nsupport  for  the  program,  but  will  also  introduce  processes  to  contribute  to  performance\nimprovement (the objective of component 5).", "21\n80. A  modern  personnel  information  system  is  needed  to  provide  accurate  and  timely\ninformation on personnel numbers, vacancies, staff movements, and payroll to support efficient\nmanagement of the establishment (approved posts) and payroll, and to support preparation of\nlonger  term  policies  on  pay  and  employment.  A  system  will  be  finalized  to  provide  a\ncomputerized linkage between the personnel information system and the payroll by the second\ntranche. Data will be used to establish the true nature of the wage bill and develop effective\ncontrols on its key elements. An important target will be to improve the system for determining\nthe number of posts in the civil service establishment and the financing of the wage bill.\nComputerization of the civil service database will be completed by the end of 2001, and linked\nto the payroll during 2002 (prior to the second tranche). The number of temporary civil servants\nhired  under  the  development  budget  will  continue  to  be  reduced.  School  enrolments  and\nnumbers of teachers in primary and secondary schools will be audited, and the number of\nteachers employed will be reduced according to actual enrolment by the second tranche. Such\nmeasures  will  be  implemented  quickly  to  avoid  a  protracted  process  of  finding  sufficient\nefficiency savings to justify moving to the next stage of reform. The longer it takes to generate\nefficiency  gains,  the  more  likely  it  is  that  support  for  and  commitment  to  reform  will  be\nundermined.\n3. Improve Governance and Reduce Corruption in Government\n81. The objectives of this component are to strengthen the legal framework for combating\ncorruption,  enforce  its  implementation,  and  ensure  the  involvement  of  civil  society  in  the\nanticorruption efforts of the Government. The key actions under the component will include\nlegislative changes for prevention and enforcement, implementation and enforcement of existing\nand  proposed  legislation,  institution  building  for  key  anticorruption  bodies,  and  raising\nawareness among citizens of the role of key anticorruption agencies and how to become\ninvolved in reducing corruption. Legislation will be finalized or enforced to require elected public\nrepresentatives  and  civil  servants  to  declare  their  assets  annually  by  the  second  tranche.\nLegislation  requiring  an  annual  financial  audit  of  all  political  parties  will  be  submitted  and\nenforced. The Government has already submitted to Parliament the amendments to the CIAA\nAct to enhance its independence, the amended bill on specialized courts, and the bill on\nprevention of corruption. A special CIAA cadre is currently being established, recruited, and\ntrained with the assistance of TA 3622 to investigate individuals suspected of corrupt practices.\nTA  3622  consultants  are  also  assisting  CIAA  to  develop  a  program  to  combat  money\nlaundering. This capacity building will be extended to district administration offices with an\naction plan and will be linked directly to the overall operations of the prosecution process and in\nparticular CIAA.\n82. Management audits of staff transfers and placements will be regularly conducted by\nMOGA. Additional anticorruption legislation will be submitted by the third tranche including\nlegislation to protect those providing evidence in corruption cases (\u201cwhistleblower protection\u201d)\nand legislation on antimoney laundering. The Cabinet Secretariat will develop rules of procedure\nfor use by the Constitutional Council. A public awareness campaign to inform the public about\nCIAA functions and complaints procedures will also be initiated by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office\nprior to the second tranche, and continuously thereafter. The interactive campaign will inform\nthe public about CIAA procedures, the targets that it sets itself for action, and the constraints\nand risks that need to be overcome to achieve these targets.", "22\n4.  Enhance the Competence and Motivation of Civil Servants\n83. Civil  servants  in  Nepal  have  low  motivation  and  often  lack  necessary  skills  and\ncompetencies to do a better job. The objective of this component is to increase their motivation\nand  skills  by  adopting  modern  human  resource  management  principles.  To  increase  staff\nmotivation, a critical element of the component will be to adopt by the second tranche a\nlong-term pay policy with a revised civil service salary structure to enhance pay and widen pay\ndifferentials. The differentials will underpin incentives for improvement in performance. The\nGovernment will also approve as a second tranche condition an affirmative action policy and\nprogram to increase the representation of women in the civil service, including the percentage of\nwomen occupying senior positions.\n84. To  strengthen  recruitment  and  promotion  of  staff  based  on  merit,  the  personnel\nadministration  function  in  MOGA  will  be  strengthened  with  additional  qualified  staff  and\nimprovement of personnel systems. Civil service recruitment and promotion will be reformed\nbased  on  merit  principles,  which  will  lead  to  promotions  founded  on  transparent  and\naccountable performance. GRCU will work together with PSC to develop merit criteria and the\ncapacity to apply merit-based procedures, with appropriate attention to gender issues. The Civil\nService Act will be amended by the second tranche to institutionalize merit-based principles,\nreduce  political  interference  in  transfers  and  placements,  and  strengthen  grievance  and\ndisciplinary  procedures.  In  the  development  and  application  of  merit-based  principles,\nstakeholders  will  be  consulted  to  reach  agreement  on  reducing  the  pervasive  system  of\npatronage. Desirable leadership qualities for senior civil servants will be developed by the\nsecond tranche through training and will be applied in promotion procedures; and management\nand skill development programs for selected civil servants will be introduced. Induction training\nfor new gazetted officers will also be improved as a second tranche condition. Definition of\ninstitutional responsibilities and legal and regulatory changes will accompany these reforms.\nThe actions required to implement the new processes will be consistent with the focus on\nperformance-based management processes. A very important aspect of this component will be\nthat all human resource management measures will be developed with utmost care to address\nissues related to women and increasing their participation in the civil service.\n5. Establish Processes for Improving Performance in Key Ministries\n85. The aim of this component is to deliver better services to citizens by reinforcing a new\npublic  management  culture  and  work  processes  that  are  related  to  performance-based\nmanagement  in  selected  service  and  central  ministries.  Three  service  delivery  ministries\n(MOAC, MOES, and MOH) and two central ministries (MOF and MOGA) will be supported\nunder this component. Management performance plans will be developed for GRCU and the\nMOF Efficiency Unit, which are the focal points for leading the reform program. These plans will\nbuild on past TA work, and will include all areas of the ministries with a view to improving their\nown performance and transferring new procedures and capacities for support to the three pilot\nline ministries. All of the TA components will provide GRCU, the Efficiency Unit in MOF and the\nchange units of the three respective line ministries, with customized training, and mentoring to\nensure that needed leadership and technical skills are available for the design of the appropriate\nmanagement and performance plans and their subsequent implementation. The central focus\nwill be to establish the culture and processes related to performance-based management for\nselected public sector entities, and demonstrate the budget incentives, efficiency dividends, and\nbenefits in terms of improved outcomes.", "23\n86. Annual  performance  improvement  plans,  including  client  service  standards,  will  be\ndeveloped for the three line ministries (MOAC, MOES and MOH) and publicized by the second\ntranche for MOAC, and by the third tranche for MOES and MOH. The annual plans will include a\nreview process to identify further performance improvements and service quality standards.\nPerformance plans will include performance indicators for programs under improvement. For\nexample, a universal primary education performance plan may include measures in terms of\nnumber  of  children  educated,  student/teacher  ratios,  and  number  of  children  successfully\nfinishing the school year. Such performance plans will also establish accountability and lead to\nefficiency savings. A key feature of the plans that will facilitate reform and provide incentives for\nthe  three  line  ministries  will  be  the  possibility  of  retaining  efficiency  savings  within  a\nmedium-term expenditure management framework. To access these savings, a performance\nimprovement fund will be introduced in a phased manner starting by the second tranche and\nprovided to ministries that successfully introduce performance improvement plans. Institutional\narrangements for the implementation of such a fund will be designed prior to the second\ntranche. The fund will be used for skills development, improved business processes, engaging\nspecialist staff, and purchase of needed equipment such as computers. Management and in-\nservice training will be provided to develop the skills needed to analyze current problems,\ndesign possible business solutions, and hence improve ministry performance as specified in the\nperformance  improvement  plans.  Annual  reports  on  the  execution  of  the  performance\nimprovement plans will be made public.\n87. It is important to note that the improvements sought in these ministries are sequenced\ntowards the end of the first phase of the reform program, since they need to be supported by the\nother GRP initiatives. Senior management leadership and direction are needed so that middle\nmanagers will be motivated to introduce the needed new processes. Staff discontent with the\nterms  and  conditions  of  their  employment\u2014pay  levels,  promotions,  transfers,  grievance\nprocedures, and issues of inequality\u2014needs to be remedied so that they are motivated. A\nmerit-based  promotion  system  that  is  centered  on  performance,  transparency,  and\naccountability needs to be introduced as part of the process of increasing motivation. The\nneeded  training  and  improved  working  conditions  that  can  result  from  the  performance\nimprovement fund need to be approved, but based on targeted savings from cost reduction\nmeasures, so that there will be an opportunity for the plans to effect the needed improvements\nin service delivery standards. Equally, through the communications program with civil society\nand the independent program reporting mechanism, demand for services at appropriate levels\nneeds to be established and maintained.\nD. Social and Environmental Issues\n1.  General  Social Issues\n88. The  planned  GRP  will  introduce  significant  reforms  in  all  sectors  for  which  the\nGovernment is responsible, including critical social sectors such as agriculture, education, and\nhealth. Service delivery will be divided between central and local bodies, with improved service\ndelivery in the agriculture, education, and health sectors contributing to improvements in social\nwelfare. Attempts will be made to redress the gender imbalance in the civil service by adopting\nan affirmative action plan to increase the representation of women at all levels of the civil\nservice, and to increase their participation in the reform process.\n89. The GRP may lead to social costs caused by (i) reduced quality, timeliness, and volume\nof service delivery in the short term; and (ii) unemployment as a result of retrenchment of civil\nservants in agencies that are overstaffed or in non-essential areas of the civil service. The", "24\nreform process will necessarily be long term, and improvements in efficiency and effectiveness\nthat will lead to benefits from economic growth and poverty reduction may not all be immediate.\nReforms of ministries and other agencies may result in incremental funding requirements for\noffices, and should lead to improved working conditions through the provision of additional office\nspace; better equipment and facilities; and training, capacity building, and institutional reforms\nfor civil servants. These improvements will require provision of additional budget resources to\nupgrade agency equipment.\n90. Measures are incorporated into the program to mitigate possible negative impacts of the\nreforms. The Government will take action during the reform process to (i) strengthen social\nsector reforms, (ii) mitigate any possible negative impacts of the governance reforms, and (iii)\nensure transparency and broad acceptance of the reform program to avoid any negative social\nimpact and build political support among all parties for the reforms.\n1.  Governance and Poverty\n91. Governance reform will assist in poverty reduction through better allocation of resources\nand their more efficient use, more efficient social service delivery, and effective implementation\nof  targeted  programs.  Inefficient  social  service  delivery  contributes  to  the  low  human\ndevelopment indicators in Nepal and potentially to inequality because of the disparity in quality\nof public service delivery to different segments of society. A reformed civil service with high\nmorale, transparency, accountability, and a high degree of responsibility will not only promote\neconomic growth but also implement other service delivery and targeted poverty reduction\nprograms more efficiently and cost effectively. There is therefore a need to reorient the role of\nthe bureaucracy to one of facilitation and regulation within a competitive market economy.\n92. \u201cRightsizing\u201d of the bureaucracy is an important aspect of the reform measures, and, if\nnot properly designed and managed, could lead to large-scale retrenchment of employees, with\nresultant negative welfare impacts. Such measures need to be carefully designed, discussed\nwith targeted employees, and implemented to minimize potential negative impacts. Ideally, both\nthe  Government  and  targeted  staff  should  benefit  from  such  programs,  creating  win-win\nsituations. This can be accomplished using the VERS, for instance.\n93. The full participation of local government bodies and the introduction of measures to\nempower socially excluded groups and women will lead to more active participation of these\nstakeholders  in  development  activities  and  thus  reduce  the  incidence  of  poverty.  Local\ngovernment bodies are often in a better position to identify target groups and to formulate and\nimplement targeted programs. With the Local Self-Governance Act in place, central Government\ncivil  servants  posted  to  the  district  level  will  be  gradually  transferred  to  local  government\nauthorities.  This  will  eventually  result  in  the  creation  of  a  regional  cadre  of  civil  servants\nrecruited by local authorities and permanently based in the locality.\n1.  Governance and Gender\n94. As  with  other  aspects  of  governance,  achieving  the  goals  of  gender  equality  as\nenunciated in the Ninth Plan will be possible only with strong political commitment, government\nintervention, and policy action. The low proportion of women in the civil service has unbalanced\nthe equilibrium of the civil service system and reduced pressure for the introduction of measures\nto address women's interests and capacities. The Civil Service Act was amended in 1993 to\ninclude special provisions to promote women\u2019s entry into the civil service; but, despite these", "25\nmeasures, studies indicate a continuing decline in women's access to the civil service, and to\ndecision-making positions in particular.\n95. Entry into the civil service is contingent upon both men and women successfully passing\nthe PSC examinations. However, gender inequality in schooling and formal training, women's\nlack of mobility and time constraints because of unequal responsibility for household chores,\nand information asymmetries constrain women to compete successfully for entry into the civil\nservice. Government offices that are without toilet facilities for women; and the timing and\nlocation of PSC examinations are factors that women have identified as deterrents to their entry\nin the civil service. The Government has recently issued a directive to provide toilet facilities for\nwomen in all ministries.\n96. The  GRP  will  address  gender  representation  imbalances  by  introducing  affirmative\naction  amendments  to  the  Civil  Service  Act.  The  amendments  will  focus  on  alleviating\nconstraints  and  creating  new  opportunities  for  women.  These  include  (i)  holding  special\ncoaching classes for women in the five development regions of Nepal to allow more women to\ntake and successfully pass the PSC examinations; (ii)  issuance of a directive to line ministries\nmandating  women\u2019s  participation  in  civil  service  staff  development  training  activities;    (iii)\ndeveloping a merit-based approach to recruitment and promotion, keeping in mind the current\ngender imbalances in the civil service system;  and  (iv)  developing new and gender-sensitive\napproaches to procedures and processes for handling grievance and transfer issues.\n97. To secure horizontal integration of gender concerns in all stages of policy formulation (i)\nthe executive committee will include the secretaries of the Ministry of Women, Children and\nSocial Welfare; CIAA; and PSC; (ii) the change units in MOAC, MOES, and MOH will mandate\nwomen\u2019s representation in addition to assigning a gender focal point in each change unit;  (iii)\nGRCU will include a female staff member to ensure that women\u2019s concerns are reflected in the\nreform process; (iv) PSC will designate staff to liaise with GRCU to keep itself informed of\nproposed gender reforms and provide feedback to GRCU; and (v) GRCU will be provided with\nTA to guide and monitor progress in mainstreaming gender concerns. To mitigate any likely\nnegative impact on women while \u201crightsizing\u201d the civil service, MOGA in consultation with the\nMinistry of Women, Children and Social Welfare, will prepare a promotion scheme that will\noffset sociocultural impediments to women\u2019s career advancement, and an incentive mechanism\nto retain and recruit more women. These will focus on changes in legislation and regulations\nthat include provisions that women have identified as important, and that increase women\u2019s\nability to compete with men for high-paying positions. Examples include innovations in maternity\nleave, specific in-service training for women, and gender-friendly physical facilities.\n98. The achievement of gender-responsive outputs will form part of the tranche release\nconditions. The Government has agreed to approve an affirmative action policy prior to the\nrelease of the second tranche to increase women\u2019s representation in the civil service, including\nmeasures to increase the percentage of women in decision-making positions. The necessary\namendments to the Civil Service Act will be submitted to parliament prior to the second tranche.\n1.  Governance and Environment\n99. The GRP seeks to make the civil service more efficient, effective, and service-oriented\nand to reduce corruption in Nepal. Reform of the civil service is concerned primarily with\nimproving  staff  capacities  and  institutional  performance,  and  involves  limited  construction\nactivities. Anticorruption initiatives will seek to prosecute individuals for contravening regulations\nfor  their  own  benefit.  In  general,  improved  public  sector  governance  leading  to  enhanced", "26\nefficiency, predictability, accountability, and transparency will lead to improved environmental\nmanagement. Improved operation of government and anticorruption agencies should also lead\nto fewer cases of environmental degradation in contravention of existing laws and regulations.\nVI. THE PROPOSED LOAN\nA.  Amount of Loan and Source of Funds\n100. It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of Special Drawing Rights 23,484,000 or $30\nmillion equivalent from its Special Funds resources to support the GRP. The proposed size of\nthe loan is based on the scope and depth of the reform program, and on the costs of mitigating\nthe negative social impact of the reforms, such as possible increases in unemployment from\nretrenchment or privatization. In addition to such general impacts, it will be necessary to monitor\nspecific social impacts of the reform, for instance services that are devolved from the central to\nthe local level. The adjustment costs of implementing the GRP will be to some extent offset by\nthe savings achieved through reform actions (para. 129). Gross adjustment costs (excluding use\nof savings from the reforms) are estimated at $104.1 million in the short term (first four years of\nthe program) and $45.8 million from years 5 to 8 of the program. These costs include (i) the $63\nmillion cost of the VERS targeted at about 10,000 lower level civil servants;20 (ii) possible pay\npolicy changes of $37.7 million in the first phase of the program, and $37.7 million from years 5\nto 8 of the program; (iii) staff induction and specialized training costs of $2 million; (iv) $1.5\nmillion for the performance improvement fund in MOAC, MOES, and MOH; (v) and other\nmiscellaneous costs. The program adjustment costs and savings are indicated in Appendix 5.\nA.  Interest, Maturity, and Utilization Period\n101. The loan will have a maturity of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, 1 percent\ninterest during the grace period and 1.5 percent during the amortization period, and equal\namortization. The borrower will be Nepal, and the loan will be utilized from December 2001 to\nDecember 2004, with the actual program period extending to December 2005 to allow for\nfollow-up monitoring of program actions.\nC.  Implementation Arrangements\n102. The reform program will be initiated across the civil service at the central and local level\nin a phased manner from 2001 to 2005. This will provide the time required for capacity building\nand institutional strengthening of government agencies based on the experiences learned from\nimplementation of the reforms in the first five core ministries. Specific TA requirements to assist\nin these areas were identified and are described in paras. 116-124 and in Appendix 6.\n103. The EA for the program loan will be MOGA. ADB will regularly monitor the progress of\nthe GRP, with the support of the Nepal Resident Mission (NRM)\u2014in particular, through the\ninvolvement  of  the  senior  governance  and  capacity  building  officer\u2014using  the  indicators\nincluded in Appendix 2.\n                  \n20 This includes the $16. 9 million cost incurred in FY2001 for early retirement of about 2,550 civil servants. DFID also\nplans to provide about $15 million budgetary support for the VERS, and conditionalities in IMF\u2019s Poverty Reduction\nGrowth Facilty\u2019s structural matrix are also tied to VERS implementation. Therefore, additional support for these\ncosts is expected from sources other than ADB alone.", "27\n104. It is proposed that the program will receive overall guidance from the Prime Minister\u2019s\nARCMC as a strategic steering group, with operational supervision provided by the executive\ncommittee headed by the minister of MOGA. Overall coordination of all program details will be\nexercised by the project director, who will be the head of GRCU, under the guidance of the\nsecretary of MOGA.\n105. Implementation arrangements will be critical to the success of the reform program.\nBased on the experiences of managing reform in both developed and developing countries, the\nfollowing principles have guided the choice of these arrangements. First, the structures for\nsetting the overall direction of the program should be well integrated within, not separate from,\nthe  Government\u2019s  normal  management  processes.  Second,  implementation  responsibility\nshould rest with line ministries but be supported by the core ministries of the Government. Third,\nchange units are needed in the core ministries to implement key change interventions. Fourth,\ncollective ownership of reform needs to be secured among ministry secretaries for reform to\nsucceed in their individual ministries. Fifth, popular or civil society support for reform efforts is\nessential to ensure continued political support for the reform process, particularly with respect to\nreform measures that bear short-term political costs.\n106. The  implementation  framework  agreed  upon  with  the  Government  is  provided  in\nAppendix 4. The framework incorporates three key functions, including (i) strategic leadership of\nthe  overall  program,  (ii)  support  for  specific  reform  actions,  and  (iii)  implementation\nresponsibilities throughout government.\n107. At the core ministry level, program teams (GRCU and the MOF Efficiency Unit) have\nbeen created with responsibility for different aspects of the reform program. These teams will\nsupport and facilitate the introduction of reforms in line ministries, departments, and agencies.\nTo ensure that ministries will implement a coherent overall program, as opposed to a series of\ndisparate components led by different ministries, GRCU will be responsible for coordinating and\nmonitoring the reform program and will report to the secretary of MOGA.\n108. Finally,  responsibility  for  the  implementation  of  performance  management  and\nimprovement will rest primarily with the line ministries. For the reforms to be owned by the\nministries, they will need to have broad-based support from senior management. Therefore, it is\nproposed that specific reform programs be incorporated within the agenda of the ministries\u2019\nregular management meetings. The establishment of separate change units\u2014the approach\nemployed to carry out the functional reviews under the TA to prepare the program\u2014will not work\non its own, since it tends to confine thinking about reform to a small group of people.    \nC.  Procurement\n109. The loan proceeds will be made available to finance the full foreign exchange cost of\nitems produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member countries (other than those items specified\nin the ineligible list shown in Appendix 7, and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral\nsources)  for  which  expenditures  were  incurred  not  more  than  180  days  prior  to  loan\neffectiveness. Procurement of eligible items will be on the basis of normal commercial practices\nfor  procurement  by  the  private  sector  or  standard  government  procurement  procedures\nacceptable to ADB for procurement by the public sector, except that in the case of goods\ncommonly  traded  on  international  commodity  markets,  procurement  will  be  undertaken  in\naccordance with procedures acceptable to ADB. The Borrower will certify that the volume of\neligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the program loan\nin a given period.", "28\nE.  Disbursement\n110. The  details  of  tranche  disbursement  were  carefully  studied  during  loan  processing,\nconsidering  previous  ADB  experiences  with  policy-based  lending.  Given  the  time  period\nrequired to implement such a wide-ranging reform program, and the need to have continuous\ntests of the Government\u2019s commitment to the reform process, it was concluded that a program\nloan over a three-year period, with three tranches, is preferable, with a fourth year after the third\ntranche to continue monitoring the program. The first tranche will be provided following the\nGovernment\u2019s fulfillment of the conditions for loan effectiveness, which are among the actions\ncontained in the Policy Matrix. The remaining tranches will be disbursed within 18 months of the\nprevious  tranche,  provided  that  tranche  and  loan  milestone  release  conditions  are  met.\nDisbursements will be made under the simplified procedures for program loans. ADB will have\nthe right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s\ncertification.\nE.  Counterpart Funds\n111. The  counterpart  funds  in  local  currency  generated  from  the  loan  proceeds  will  be\ndeposited in a special counterpart fund account to be established by MOF at Nepal Rastra\nBank, and will become part of the Government budget every year. MOGA and MOF will decide\non the allocation of the counterpart funds and closely monitor their use through GRCU and the\nMOF Efficiency Unit. The counterpart funds generated from the loan proceeds will be used to\nsupport the implementation of the governance program. Any counterpart funds not required for\nthe program will be used first to finance women\u2019s higher education and training.\n112. All  financial  transactions  of  the  special  counterpart  fund  account  will  be  recorded\nseparately  in  a  manner  that  allows  identification  of  expenditures  from  loan  proceeds  and\ncounterpart funds. The accounts, together with records of expenditures, will be audited annually\nby the auditor general of Nepal or independent auditors, whose qualifications, experience, and\nterms of reference are acceptable to ADB. Nepal Rastra Bank will submit to ADB certified\ncopies of audited accounts and records within 12 months after the end of each fiscal year.\nGRCU, in collaboration with the MOF Efficiency Unit, will prepare and furnish to the executive\ncommittee and ADB a progress report every four months in form and detail satisfactory to the\nexecutive  committee  and  ADB.  The  progress  report  will  particularly  cover  the  status  of\nimplementation of policy and institutional reform measures and related time-bound actions, the\nprogress of disbursements of loan proceeds, and the use of counterpart funds. Within three\nmonths of the loan closing date, the Government will also submit to ADB a detailed report on\nthe performance of the proposed loan. The Government and ADB will agree upon the format\nand contents of the report.\nE.  Monitoring and Tranching\n1.  Monitoring\n113. Monitoring will take place at several levels and by several entities, consistent with the\nimplementation  arrangements  outlined  in  Appendix  4.  The  Government  will  take  overall\nresponsibility for overseeing the effective implementation of the GRP. For the GRP to succeed,\nthe cabinet and ARCMC must take overall responsibility for ensuring that it is well implemented.\nThe executive committee will take responsibility at the highest level of the civil service, while\nGRCU will continuously monitor the reform process. However, ultimately the three participating", "29\nline ministries must take ownership of the reforms to the extent of implementing them and\ncritically monitoring their own performance. The ARCMC and executive committee will each\nmeet at least twice a year to provide overall policy and operational guidance to the program. An\nindependent agency will also be recruited to monitor program performance, and will prepare\nsemiyearly reports prior to ADB review missions. TA consultants will also monitor and support\nthe GRP.\n114. The Government and ADB will jointly monitor and review the progress of implementation\nof the milestone and tranche performance conditions in the policy matrix to ensure that they are\nmet. Indicators and targets for the program are indicated in Appendix 2. More detailed indicators\nwill be developed as appropriate by the consultants of TA 3622, and by the independent\nmonitoring agency. The Government will submit implementation progress reports to ADB as part\nof the review process every four months. The Government, ADB, and other key stakeholders,\nincluding interested funding agencies, will meet every six months to review progress. ADB will\nfield review missions every six months to coincide with the review meetings. One major review\nmeeting should be held prior to the scheduled release of the next loan tranche. GRCU will\nsubmit a program completion report to ADB within three months after the loan closing date. The\nreport will evaluate implementation of the activities and outputs under the GRP components,\nand the impact of the GRP on the economy, including the social and poverty impact of the\nreforms; elaborate the lessons learned during the program; and identify the required future\nreform program and assistance required.\n1.  Tranching\n115. The GRP is already being implemented, supported by TA provided by ADB. The loan is\nestimated to be of four years duration from the date of effectiveness.  The loan proceeds will be\ndisbursed in three tranches, with the first tranche of $12 million equivalent followed by two equal\ntranches of $9 million equivalent approximately 18 months after the release of the previous\ntranche. The first tranche will be released upon completion of the normal approval processes for\nthe loan, with the succeeding tranches released subject to the Government\u2019s fulfillment of the\nconditions for their release (including milestones), which are contained in the policy matrix\n(Appendix 3). This approach has been taken to ensure that the Government shows its firm\ncommitment to the reform process throughout the program period by meeting specified tranche\nand loan milestone conditions to the satisfaction of ADB. Because a flexible process approach\nis  being  used  for  program  implementation,  details  regarding  some  tranche  conditions  will\nbecome available only after the TA consultants; GRCU; the MOF Efficiency Unit; and the\nMOAC, MOES, and MOH change management units have developed and approved policies\nand performance improvement implementation plans. The Government\u2019s continuation of the\nVERS, because of limited funds, will necessarily be related to its performance in meeting the\ntranche conditions in the policy matrix.\nVII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n116. Based on the five program components that have been identified, TA assistance will be\nrequired  in  the  following  areas:  (i)  change  and  program  management,  (ii)  efficiency\nimprovements in government, (iii) improving governance and reducing corruption, (iv) human\nresource  management,  (v)  performance  management,  (vi)  civil  society  support  for  reform\nmeasures, and (vii) independent program monitoring. TA will be provided to both GRCU and the\nMOF Efficiency Unit, and to the MOAC, MOES, and MOH change units. The primary role of the\nTA personnel will be to provide technical support and to transfer skills and knowledge to the five\nunits. ADB and the Government are finalizing funding from bilateral agencies to finance the TA,", "30\ngiven ADB\u2019s TA resource constraints. Discussions have been held concerning cofinancing of\nthe TA package with the Canadian International Development Agency, DANIDA, DFID, and\nSDC, which have all indicated their interest.\n117. The TA will be packaged into three separate contracts dealing with (i) core program\nreform,  including  team  leadership  and  change  management,  efficiency  improvements,\nimproving  governance  and  reducing  corruption,  human  resource  management,  and\nperformance management, which will also address issues of gender; (ii) civil society support for\nthe reform measures; and (iii) independent program monitoring. An international consulting firm\nin association with a local firm will implement the first contract beginning in November 2002,\nafter the ongoing TA 3622 is completed, while local firms or organizations will implement the\nsecond  and  third  contracts  beginning  in  early  2002,  with  the  possibility  of  an  individual\nundertaking the third contract. The consultants will be engaged according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines\non the Use of Consultants for TA administered by ADB. Outline terms of reference for the three\nTA packages are in Appendix 6.\nA.  Package One \u2014 Core Program Reform\n 118. There are five subpackages of this consultancy. The first will support the first component\nof the GRP. An international change and program management specialist with experience in\nteam leadership will be provided for 18 months to support GRCU and the MOF Efficiency Unit,\nand the change units in the three line ministries, ensure consistency in the TA approach,\neffectively manage the various consultants, and establish appropriate working relationships with\ncivil  service  counterparts.  A  domestic  deputy  team  leader  will  support  the  international\nconsultant for a 24-month period.\n119. The second consultancy subpackage will support the second component of the GRP\u2014to\nimprove the overall efficiency of the civil service. The Efficiency Unit in MOF will be responsible\nfor introducing measures to generate fiscal savings in line ministries, particularly to identify\nnoncore  functions  of  government  that  can  be  delegated  to  corporate  agencies,  privatized,\ncontracted  out,  eliminated,  or  devolved  to  local  authorities.  An  international  specialist  in\ndevolving government functions supported by a domestic consultant will provide inputs of six\nand eight person-months respectively. A key objective of this subpackage will also be to enable\nthe Government to control the public service wage bill through effective establishment controls.\nAn international specialist in payroll systems development and application, supported by a\ndomestic consultant will provide inputs of five and six person-months respectively.\n120. The third consultancy subpackage will support the third component of the GRP\u2014to\nimprove  governance  and  reduce  corruption  in  government.  An  international  anticorruption\nspecialist supported by domestic consultant will provide four and six person-months of support\nrespectively to assist in preparing new anti-corruption legislation and further training for anti-\ncorruption agency staff.\n121. The fourth consultancy subpackage will support the fourth component of the GRP, which\ninvolves  a  multifaceted  approach  to  enhancing  competence  that  addresses  the  selection,\nmotivation,  and  development  of  personnel  using  modern  principles  of  human  resource\nmanagement. An international specialist in civil service administrative procedures, leadership,\ntraining, and building institutional gender capacity will provide an input of three person-months,\nsupported by eight person-months of domestic input.", "31\n122. The fifth consultancy subpackage will support the fifth component of the program\u2014to\nestablish processes for improving performance and service delivery in a limited number of key\nministries  once  key  institutional  barriers  have  been  removed.  International  and  domestic\nperformance management specialists will support GRCU, the MOF Efficiency Unit, and the line\nministry change units. It is envisaged that this expertise will be required for a period of 10\nperson-months of international consultant input, and 12 person-months of domestic input.\nA.  Package Two \u2014 Civil Society Support for the Reform Measures\n123. This package of consultancy inputs will cut across and support all areas of the program.\nIn the past, reforms have been introduced in Nepal with minimal dialogue with concerned\nstakeholders. Consultations with civil society will be held throughout the reform process to\nobtain a broad spectrum of views concerning needed reforms, to inform the public of planned\nreforms,  and  to  solicit  widespread  support  and  advocacy  for  the  overall  reform  process,\nparticularly by the active group of existing governance NGOs. Other stakeholders such as civil\nservants and their unions, and politicians will also be consulted and involved in the refinement\nand implementation of the reforms. Consultant inputs for the two subcomponents will total 44\nperson-months of domestic specialists.\nC. Package Three \u2014 Program Monitoring and Reporting\n124. This consultancy input will also cover all the objectives of the program, since it will\nprovide an independent review and reporting mechanism, ensuring that all stakeholders, and\nparticularly civil society, have detailed information on the program goals, plans, implementation\nsuccesses, and failures. The contract will be awarded to a domestic individual or organization\nsuch as an NGO to promote greater transparency in government performance within the defined\nparameters of this important reform initiative. Consultant input of 12 person-months will be\nrequired over the program period.\nVIII. PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA.  Program Benefits\n125. Introducing  a  \u201crightsized,\u201d  better  remunerated,  and  motivated  civil  service,  trained\ntowards concepts of \u201ccustomer\u201d service, with openness in its attempts to provide such service is\na lofty goal, and one that may well take many years of sustained effort to achieve. The GRP\nsupports the initial but vital steps of such a long-term vision. It will promote some of the key\nunderpinnings, pilot new approaches such as performance plans, service delivery standards,\nand devolution of functions; and attempt to deal with issues of governance that currently hamper\nefficiency and lead to distrust in government operations. The program specifically targets some\nof the most important motivational and institutional factors, that when strengthened can be\nessential  building  blocks  to  achieve  needed  changes.  It  also  addresses  corruption,  by\ndelineating a legislative agenda as well as institutional strengthening mechanisms to reduce\ncorruption  both  at  the  political  and  civil  service  level.  These  steps  are  needed  to  lay  the\nfoundations of the long course towards meeting the vision of the GRP, and also because the\ncurrent operations of the civil service have fallen below the levels of acceptability, with a greatly\nreduced capacity to positively impact poverty through the proper utilization of resources.\n126. The program provides an opportunity for government to clearly demonstrate to the\nNepalese people that the civil service can be made more people- and service-oriented, resulting\nin better and deeper provision of services in key social sectors\u2014agriculture, education, and", "32\nhealth. It also introduces for the first time the concept of \u201ctaxpayer rights\u201d in the designs for\neliciting the views of civil society into the program scope, feeding back performance results, and\nutilizing civil society to check on key provision of services at the grassroots level. Within a\nsociety that has not understood that modern governments should be obligated towards the\nconcept of service, these changes, if successful, could provide the underpinnings for radical\nchanges in the way services are expected, provided, and accepted.\n127. Other  design  features  of  the  program,  particularly  within  the  legal  framework  for\nimproved governance, have the potential to increase greatly the transparency of government\nactions, with a resulting decrease in forms of behavior that are incompatible with efficiency and\nservice  delivery.  Again,  full  disclosure  by  government  under  the  program\u2019s  reporting\nmechanisms could greatly increase the trust and respect of the populace, while also serving to\neducate and better inform people about issues of financial propriety. By stressing consultation\nwith and participation of key stakeholders and civil society and by emphasizing raising public\nawareness for governance, the program goes a long way to creating an open work environment\nand changing citizens\u2019 attitudes towards government.\n128. This program is but the first step in what is likely to be a lengthy transition. As such it is\nnot comprehensive; rather it selects key aspects within the features and characteristics of the\ncurrent civil service regime that government believes deserve attention and that can be the\nbuilding blocks upon which further reforms can be introduced, refined, and implemented. The\nchoice of three line ministries whose mission is intimately tied to service to the public and that\ndeliver these services within the whole territory of Nepal makes success of the initial phase\nimportant to diffuse eventually the learning from it to the rest of the public service. If successful,\nfurther expansion of the concepts and programs should be much easier than the initial phase.\n129. A number of benefits or savings will accrue to the government from implementation of\nthe GRP measures. These are estimated to total approximately $104.1 million for the first four\nyears of the program, and $243.9 million from years 5 to 8 of the program. Savings from the\nefficiencies that will be achieved under component 2 of the GRP include (i) salary and benefit\nsavings from the voluntary early retirement of 10,000 employees of about $14.4 million in the\nfirst four years of the program, and $9.2 million from years 5 to 8; (ii) total savings from abolition\nof  positions  through  attrition  of  about  $11.5  million;  (iii)  savings  from  contracting  out  and\ndevolution of functions of $32 million; (iv) savings from decentralization of functions of $32\nmillion; (v) savings from better management of temporary contract positions of $10.5 million; (vi)\nsavings of $40.5 million from performance improvements; and (vii) savings  through effective\nimplementation of the medium-term expenditure management framework of $197.9 million. The\nsavings obtained during the first eight years of the GRP can be used to contribute to the\nfinancing of program adjustment costs, leading to a decrease in the gross adjustment cost\nmentioned in para. 100, and to finance salary increases for civil servants. For instance, the\nestimated net fiscal savings in the first four years of the program would permit a 14 percent\nincrease in the wage bill. The estimated savings from the program are contained in Appendix 5.\nA.  Program Impact\n1.  Poverty Impact\n130. The impact of governance reform measures on poverty is elaborated in Appendix 8.\nPoverty issues are directly addressed by the GRP through the positive impact that it will have on\nservice delivery to the poor and socially excluded groups, and their increased participation and\nempowerment.  While  some  unemployment  can  be  expected  because  of  retrenchment  of", "33\nemployees, careful management of such \u201crightsizing\u201d using the VERS would benefit both the\nGovernment and the affected employees.\n131. The potential benefits of effective implementation of governance reform measures are\nsubstantial and extensive, affecting the entire nation and economy. Growth prospects will be\nimproved because of the introduction of measures to enhance efficiency and control corruption.\nThese measures have the potential to stimulate private sector productivity and investment.\nAttainment  of  the  Government\u2019s  development  strategy  of  propoor,  broad-based  economic\ngrowth will be promoted, and the increase in growth will reduce the incidence of poverty through\nemployment promotion and through increases in labor productivity. The improved provision of\npublic services for social priority sectors and the enhanced quality of these public goods and\nservices will augment labor productivity and consequently employee wage levels.\n2.  Gender Impact\n132. By making gender responsiveness a key part of the overall goal, the GRP effectively\nlinks  gender  awareness  in  policy  and  programs  to  equitable,  efficient,  and  sustainable\noutcomes. The GRP will contribute to redistributing power and equitable access to economic\nopportunity and social resources by securing more appropriate gender representation. This will\ncontribute to reforming the bureaucracy to improve service delivery, and will have a positive\nimpact on reducing poverty. Improving gender responsiveness is part of an overall process of\ninstitutional  reform  that  will  be  achieved  by  systematically  mainstreaming  gender  into  the\ninternal organizational structure, personnel policies, and working conditions of the civil service.\nAffirmative action will increase women\u2019s options to participate in the civil service and actively\nincrease women\u2019s control and command over resources. In addition, opportunities for broad\npublic debate will create the processes for greater participation of civil society and foster more\npropoor development. The gender impacts of the program are detailed in Appendix 9.\nA.  Program Risks\n133. A basic assumption in the formulation of the GRP is that government and in particular a\nfew central position holders are prepared to introduce and implement major changes in the way\nthe civil service as a whole is led, motivated, and evaluated, in an environment of reduced\ncorruption. In turn, it is also assumed that improvements in these important factors will underpin\nthe likelihood of improved performance in key areas of implementation and service delivery. A\nkey to the success of the reforms will be to further develop and sustain broad political and\nbureaucratic commitment to the reforms at the central and local levels. However, it is clear that\nthere are several risks in embarking on a governance reform program in Nepal. The risks\ninclude changing commitment by the Government and individuals; resistance of politicians, civil\nservants, and others; and risks because of weak institutional capacity.\n134. The  political  risks  caused  by  continued  political  instability,  frequent  changes  in  the\ncomposition of the cabinet and leadership, and insurgency are addressed by the GRP in several\nways. All political parties have been involved in discussions regarding the scope of the GRP, will\ncontinue to be briefed by the Government, and have indicated a strong commitment to and\nprioritization  of  the  reform  program,  primarily  because  they  realize  that  the  governance\nenvironment in Nepal must be improved to address pressing poverty and insurgency issues.\nKey advocates of governance reform are influential members of cabinet. Advocates of reform\nare also found in strategic leadership positions in the bureaucracy. Efforts will be made to\ndeepen the commitment of existing reform advocates, and broaden the reform constituency.\nThe program is designed to mitigate the risk of reduced political and bureaucratic commitment", "34\nto the reform program by (i) using three tranches over three years to ensure that government\ncommitment is sustained and demonstrated over the medium term; (ii) providing performance\nincentive  funds  to  motivate  participating  ministries  to  implement  the  reforms;  (iii)  actively\nengaging civil society in the program as advocates of the reforms to maintain pressure on the\nGovernment to implement the GRP, to involve citizens in demanding reforms, and to monitor\nimplementation; (iv) strengthening anticorruption agencies and citizen involvement in identifying\ncorruption cases; and (v) providing TA to strengthen institutional capacity.\n135. Beyond the issue of political will to sustain commitment to and implement the needed\nchanges is the question of technical skills in areas that are new to government employees.\nPerformance  improvement  plans;  service  delivery  concepts;  and  issues  of  devolution,\ncommercialization,  and  contracting  out  to  the  private  sector  are  not  the  normal  areas  of\nknowledge and competency within a government bureaucracy. While steps will be taken to\novercome  the  newness  of  the  concepts  and  increase  acceptance  through  various  training\nprograms, mentoring, and implementation of the TA, close monitoring will be needed to assess\nhow well the concerned civil servants cope with these features of the program. There is also a\nrisk  that  the  public  may  resist  the  provision  of  services  by  the  private  sector.  Regular\ncommunication with civil society to build awareness and obtain feedback under TA package 2\nshould help mitigate this risk.\n136. Any change in the existing situation is likely to cause some individuals or groups to lose\nprivileged  positions  or  benefits,  while  many  of  the  winners  are  likely  to  be  outside  the\nbureaucracy and hence not directly able to counter negative forces that are likely to arise.\nHowever, the program has attempted to mitigate this particular risk through an innovative\napproach to citizen and civil society advocacy and involvement, with a further feature that\nprovides  for  independent  assessment  and  reporting  on  program  planning,  processes,  and\nresults  by  an  independent  organization  or  individual  under  TA  package  3.  In  addition,\nintroduction, implementation, and enforcement of new procedures will curb negative responses.\nThe performance incentive fund will also motivate civil servants to support the program.\n137. The government bureaucracy is to an extent managed by an elite group, which makes\nlittle distinction between personal and public resources. Therefore, there is the risk that public\ninterests may be sacrificed to retain control over access to power and authority, jeopardizing\nopportunities for institutional reform. To address this risk, the loan will be disbursed in three\ntranches over a three-year period. Compliance with tranche conditions and related milestones\nwill be required for tranche release. This will allow constant monitoring of the Government\u2019s\nongoing and continued commitment to the GRP by the GRCU, ADB headquarters staff, the\nNRM senior governance and capacity building officer, and the independent program monitoring\nconsultant provided under TA Package 3. New champions of the GRP will constantly be sought,\nparticularly if old champions move to other positions or retire, while existing champions will be\nsupported and strengthened. The performance incentive fund also provides strong motivation to\ncontinue support for the reforms.\n138. The Government delivery system may fail to ensure equitable outcomes for women\nbecause of its insensitivity and inability to mainstream gender and development issues, leaving\ngender hierarchies intact.  The gender desk at MOGA will develop linkages among senior policy\nmakers and program administrators for enhanced policy and program coordination on gender-\nspecific activities. Outputs that improve women\u2019s access to civil service positions are also\nincluded as tranche release conditions.", "35\n139. While the Government and ADB will make every effort to secure bilateral cofinancing for\nthe required TA for the GRP, there is a risk that such cofinancing may not be forthcoming,\ndespite  positive  indications  from  DFID,  the  Canadian  International  Development  Agency,\nDANIDA, and SDC. To mitigate this risk, the Government and ADB have agreed to consider\nfunding the TA as required from their own resources in the event that cofinancing is not\navailable.\nIX. ASSURANCES\n140. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)   Policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the Loan Agreement, as\ndescribed  in  the  development  policy  letter,  will  continue  in  effect  for  the\nduration of the GRP period.\n(i)   The Government will promptly adopt the other policies and take the other\nactions included in the GRP as specified in the development policy letter and\nwill ensure that such policies and actions continue in effect for the duration of\nthe GRP period.\n(i)   The  Government  will  ensure  that  sufficient  counterpart  funds  are  made\navailable to meet all financial requirements associated with implementation of\nthe GRP, including those for addressing the social dimensions of civil service\nreform.\n(i)   The Government will ensure that the change units in all the pilot ministries\n(GRCU in MOGA; the Efficiency Unit in MOF; and the change units in MOAC,\nMOES, and MOH) are adequately staffed and provided with the necessary\nfinancial, technical, and other resources, including equipment, to perform their\nfunctions under the GRP.\n(i)   The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other\nmultilateral  and  bilateral  aid  agencies  that  have  implications  for  the  GRP\nimplementation, and will provide ADB with an opportunity to comment on any\nresulting policy proposals. The Government will take ADB\u2019s views into account\nbefore finalizing and implementing any such proposals.\n(i)   The  Government  will  take  all  appropriate  and  necessary  measures  to\nmainstream gender and increase the percentage of women civil servants.\nX.

Overall Approach to the Consultancy\n1. The  objective  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  to  build  upon  the  Government\u2019s\nimproving ability to lead, coordinate and implement its chosen long-term governance reform\nprogram. Under TA 36221 the Government is receiving 100 person-months of TA to begin the\nprocess of building the reform program over the first 12 months of this four-year program, until\nOctober 2002. The proposed TA packages will provide supplemental assistance starting in year\none (early 2002) of the program (Packages 2 and 3) and new assistance for years two through\nfour (Package 1, beginning in November 2002), building on what is expected to be completed\nwithin the first year by adding resources for new initiatives as the program develops in later\nyears.\n2. The overall approach will be to assist the Government\u2019s own staff to plan, implement and\nmonitor the agreed upon reform program. The Government has already established change\nunits in the key ministries\u2014Finance (MOF), General Administration (MOGA), Agriculture and\nCooperatives (MOAC), Education and Sports (MOES), and Health (MOH).\n3. The skills and working style of the international and domestic consultants will need to be\nappropriate to the objectives of the assignment, providing support to the staff. While consultants\nwill need to have technical competence in their respective areas, it will be important that they do\nnot undertake the work for the civil servants, but rather act as mentors and facilitators in the\nvarious areas to be covered. The consultant teams should be gender balanced. The TA will   be\norganized   into   three   separate   packages: (i) Package 1, entitled Core Program Reforms,\nwill cover all five program components (as contained in the policy matrix); (ii) Package 2 will\ncover  Civil  Society  Support  for  Reform  Measures;  and  (iii)  Package  3  will  cover  Project\nMonitoring.\nB.  Package 1: Core Program Reforms\n4. Package 1 will provide 6 international and 6 domestic consultants for a total of 46\nperson-months of international input and 64 person-months of domestic input. This package of\nassistance will provide inputs as described below. Each input area is related to a specific\nprogram objective. This package will continue the work started by TA 3622.\n1. Component 1: Develop an Internal Capacity for Leading Reform\n5. Rationale and Objectives. The Government has recognized that in the past it had no\ncentral focal point for managing a process of crosscutting governance reforms. As such it has\ncreated a number of focal points so that needed reforms have (i) a central strategic focus\u2014the\nAdministrative Reforms Coordination and Monitoring Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister;\n(ii) a central planning and monitoring focus across government\u2014the executive committee of\nsecretaries, chaired by the minister of general administration, and implementation units at the\ncenter; (iii) the Efficiency Unit in MOF;  (iv) the Governance Reform Coordination Unit (GRCU)\nin MOGA; plus (v) change units  in the three affected line ministries\u2014MOAC, MOES, and MOH.\nThe  proposed  TA  aims  to  provide  managerial  and  facilitation  support  to  these  groups  to\n                  \n1 TA 3622-NEP: Institutional Support for Governance Reforms, for $1,525,000, approved on 18 January 2001.", "60\nAppendix 6, page 2\nexercise  their  new  terms  of  reference  in  undertaking  needed  policy  decisions  and\nimplementation actions.\n6. Scope and Range of Services. The TA will fund an international change management\nand management development specialist for 18 person-months who will also be the team\nleader, supported by a domestic consultant for 24 person-months, over a three-year period\nstarting November 2002. The change management and management development specialist\nwill be responsible to the secretary of MOGA and have overall responsibility for facilitating the\nwork  of  the  key  committees  and  the  five  change  units  mentioned  in  para.  5,  developing\nleadership and change skills of committee and change unit members, building confidence, and\nsupporting preparation of draft policies and action plans by the respective committees and\nchange units. The change management and management development specialist will also\nprovide input into the design and presentation of leadership courses to be run for the staff of the\nchange units in MOGA, MOF, and the line ministries.\n2. Component 2: Improve the Efficiency of the Civil Service\n7. Rationale and Objectives. Over past years the number of civil servants and teachers\nemployed has increased beyond the ability of the budget to cope, thus reducing the amount of\nfunds available for required operation and maintenance needed to make them productive in\nproviding  services  to  the  populace.  The  planned  efficiency  initiatives  involve  a  number  of\ntechnical and administrative areas, such as payroll monitoring, development of computerized\nsystems for personnel management, and auditing of numbers and payments where current\nskills and confidence levels among civil servants to undertake these actions are low. The TA\naims to support the various change units at the center and in the line ministries to review the\ncurrent problems in these areas and help them to devise and implement appropriate solutions to\nimprove systems and procedures that will deliver savings and better impact for resources\napplied.\n8. Scope and Range of Services. The TA will support the areas mentioned in para. 7, and\nwill be implemented by the various units at the center and in affected line ministries. An\ninternational  and  domestic  devolution  specialist  will  work  six  and  eight  person-months\nrespectively,  and  an  international  and  domestic  payroll  specialist  will  provide  five  and  six\nperson-months of inputs respectively for this aspect of the TA.\n3.  Component 3: Improve Governance and Reduce Corruption in Government\n9. Rationale and Objectives.  The Government is making the reduction of corruption one\nof its key priorities. It has prepared legislation that will require asset declaration from politicians\nand  gazetted  civil  servants,  strengthen  the  Commission  for  the  Investigation  of  Abuse  of\nAuthority (CIAA), and establish special courts. The Government intends to adopt additional\nanticorruption legislation such as those on whistleblower protection, and antimoney laundering.\n10. Scope and Range of Services.  An international and a domestic consultant will provide\nfour and six months of assistance respectively between November 2002 and the end of 2004.\nThe consultants will report to the chief commissioner of CIAA and liaise with the secretary of\nMOGA with the following key tasks: (i) provide support to draft new anticorruption legislation\nsuch as on antimoney laundering and whistleblower protection, (ii) advise the government on a\ncomprehensive legal program for its anticorruption initiatives, and (iii) provide training to the staff\nof CIAA and other organizations involved in ensuring compliance with anticorruption legislation.", "61\nAppendix 6, page 3\n4. Component 4: Enhance the Competence and Motivation of Civil Servants\n11. Rationale and Objectives. The Government has identified a number of areas that\ndirectly affect the competence and motivation levels of staff, including issues of remuneration,\nprinciples for hiring, promotion, discipline, and lack of specialized training. Under the ongoing\nTA  3622  the  areas  of  remuneration,  human  resources  policies  for  hiring,  promotion,  and\ngrievance, are already being addressed. However, the issue of specialized training and the\nneed for a reformulation of the induction courses and courses for gazetted officers remain. As\nwell, gender imbalance needs to be more comprehensively addressed as a crosscutting issue.\nThe TA will support human resource management processes, such as hiring, staff resource\nmanagement techniques, grievance, transfer, and promotion procedures based on merit which\nhave to be addressed. Additionally, annual performance reviews and procedures for succession\nplanning of senior civil servants will be introduced. These are all to be underpinned by further\nrefinements to the pay policy and a new wage scale.\n12. Scope  and  Range  of  Services.  The  international  and  domestic  consultants  will\nrespectively provide three and eight months of assistance from November 2002 to the end of\n2004, reporting to the secretary of MOGA, and also working with management of the Nepal\nAdministrative Staff College and the Public Service Commission. The international and domestic\nconsultants  will  both  have  experience  in  building  institutional  gender  capacity  to  translate\ngender  concepts  into  the  reform  process  and  outputs,  including  increasing  women\u2019s\nrepresentation in organizations.\n5. Component  5:  Establish  Processes  for  Improving  Performance  in  Key\nMinistries  (MOAC, MOES, MOF, MOGA, and MOH)\n13. Rationale and Objectives. In recent years some sector ministries have made attempts\nto provide better service delivery but these efforts have tended to be fragmented and piecemeal.\nIn keeping with the Government\u2019s overall goal of improving service delivery, three core service\ndelivery ministries will undertake a program of improving their service delivery performance, as\nmonitored against established service standards. Further, in terms of overall performance, this\neffort is to be leveraged through the creation of a performance improvement fund, whereby\nministries  with  approved  plans  gain  additional  control  over  resources  allocated  under  the\nbudget. Additionally, the two central ministries, MOGA and MOF, need to have their program\nsupport units\u2014GRCU in MOGA and the Efficiency Unit in MOF\u2014strengthened so their staff can\nprovide guidance to the line ministries under the Program, and also within the wider aspects of\ntheir day-to-day responsibilities.\n14. Scope and Range of Services. The scope of this initiative, which will start with MOA\nunder the ongoing TA 3622 contract, and be extended to MOES and MOH during the second to\nfourth years of the program, requires expertise in performance management. The performance\nmanagement specialist, working with other specialists will assess the skill levels and needs of\nline ministry personnel and management in relation to preparation of performance improvement\nplans, and will provide direction on covering areas directly relevant to production of the plan.\nThe  services  of  performance  management  specialists    (10  person-months  of  international\nexpertise and 12 person-months of domestic expertise) will be required.", "62\nAppendix 6, page 4\nC.  Package 2: Civil Society Support for Reform Measures\n(44 person-months of domestic input)\n15. Rationale and Objectives. The Government has decided that, to build political and civil\nsociety support for the Reform Program, it will conduct a widespread communication campaign\nregarding all the major aspects of the Reform Program. Internally this will include civil servants,\npoliticians, and the unions directly affected by the scope of the Governance Reform Program.\nExternally, it will address civil society and nongovernment organizations. In the communication\neffort, the gender-sensitive aspects of the Program will also be emphasized.  It is intended not\nonly to inform, but also to seek discussion and inputs from civil society as a way of making the\nProgram more transparent and ensuring that where the public are directly concerned\u2014such as\nthe use of services\u2014they have mechanisms for input and feedback on performance.\n16. Scope  and  Range  of  Services.  The  contract  will  cover  two  areas:  (i)  general\ncommunication on the Governance Reform Program to a variety of audiences; and (ii) specific\ncommunication to the public on issues of service delivery standards, including mechanisms for\ninput to the standards and feedback on performance.\nD. Package 3: Program Monitoring (12 person-months of domestic input)\n17. Rationale and Objectives. The Government has recognized that, as part of its efforts to\nincrease transparency and increase civil society confidence in its efforts for governance reform,\nit will be necessary to utilize the services of a reputable, independent organization or individual\nto review the program, procedures, plans, and results achieved, and to have these findings\ndistributed and discussed in the widest possible forums. The proposed TA will fund these\nprogram monitoring services.\n18. Scope and Range of Services. Needed inputs are for a program evaluation specialist\n(12 person-months) over the 48-month program period.\nE. Implementation Arrangements for the Consulting Services\n19. The prime Executing Agency for all proposed TA will be MOGA, in conjunction with MOF\nand  the  three  line  ministries  implementing  the  program  actions.  As  detailed  above,  each\npackage and its component parts will be provided for various periods during the program, and\nwill be tailored to fit the progress being made under each element of the overall Program. In\ntotal the TA will require 46 person-months of international input, as defined above, and will\nutilize 120 person-months of domestic consulting services, with (i) Package 1 using 46 person-\nmonths of international and 64 person-months of domestic, (ii) Package 2 using 44 person-\nmonths of domestic, and (iii) Package 3 using 12 person-months domestic consultant input.\nTotal costs of the proposed TA packages are summarized in Table A6.1, and amount to $2.4\nmillion,  of  which  about  $2  million  may  be  financed  from  bilateral  aid  agencies,  or  the\nGovernment.", " 63\nAppendix 6, page 5\nTable A6.1: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

Social Assessment\n1. There is higher poverty incidence in Nepal in more remote areas and among more\nsocially excluded and vulnerable groups. The change process is even slower where human\ndevelopment indicators are low, and consequently the barrier of social stratification is stronger.\nEthnic  minorities  and  caste  groups  are  often  lower  in  the  social  hierarchy,  with  unequal\ndistribution of access to resources. Women also face discrimination; they have always been\nassigned a lower position than men in every aspect of life. Various socioeconomic indicators\nhave been improving in Nepal since their collection was started roughly four decades ago.\nHowever, as the country started with very low values for such indicators and progress in most\ncases has been at a relatively low pace, the current situation is characterized by low levels of\nsocioeconomic  indicators  even  by  South  Asian  standards.  Almost  60  percent  of  the  adult\npopulation cannot read or write\u2014almost 80 percent for females and 43 percent for males; less\nthan 30 percent of the population does not have access to safe drinking water; the country has\nthe highest infant mortality rate (75 per thousand in 1999) in South Asia; and about 47 percent\nof children below five years of age are malnourished.\nB.  Poverty Assessment\n2. The first effort to gauge the incidence of poverty was attempted by the National Planning\nCommission  in  1976/77.  The  Nepal  Living  Standards  Survey  (1996)1  provides  the  latest\ninformation on the dimensions and characteristic features of poverty. According to the Survey,\nthe poverty line is set at NRe4,404 per person per year,2 based on a food consumption basket\nof 2,124 calories and an allowance for nonfood items of about 35 percent of the cost of the food\nbasket.\n3. Poverty in Nepal is widespread, with 42 percent of the population living below the\npoverty line. This figure does not, however, convey the depth and severity of poverty in Nepal.\nLarge segments of the poor are hardcore poor, barely eking out a subsistence living from\nfragile,  vulnerable  ecosystems,  and  large  areas  of  the  country  lack  even  the  most  basic\ninfrastructure, which is reflected by low socioeconomic indicators at the district level. There are\nwide variations based on the rural-urban divide, geography, ethnic group, and occupational\ncaste. About 44 percent of rural households and 23 percent of urban households are estimated\nto lie below the poverty line. Given that close to 88 percent of the total population reside in rural\nareas, poverty is much more severe in rural areas. It does not vary much between the hills and\nthe Terai, but is much higher in the mountains.3 The distribution of poverty incidence across the\nfive development regions indicates that the number of households below the poverty line in the\neastern and central development regions is less than those of the other regions.\nC.  Social and Poverty Impact of the Civil Service Reform Program\n1. General Impact\n4. The social and poverty importance of governance reforms is analyzed in terms of their\nanticipated impacts upon the labor market, prices of goods and services, service delivery, public\n                  \n1 Central Bureau of Statistics with support from the World Bank.\n2 This comes to $80 adjusted to inflation and at an exchange rate of $1 to Re70 for FY 2000.\n3 Nepal is divided into three geographic regions, the lowlands (Terai), the middle hills, and the high mountains.", "66\nAppendix 8, Page 2\nsocial expenditure, participation and empowerment, and poverty. Civil service reforms touch\nupon major issues related to reducing the size of the bureaucracy, enhancing morale through\nimproved pay scale and implementation of a merit-based recruitment and promotion system,\nreducing corruption through the use of transparent procedures and creating a framework for\nprosecuting corrupt politicians and civil servants, and promoting leadership qualities among civil\nservants. These measures are intended to improve social sector service delivery, enhance\nresource allocation efficiency and its use, generate a greater sense of accountability, monitor\npublic and private sector performance more effectively, and promote more transparent and\nparticipatory  decision-making.  The  reform  measures  are  thus  meant  to  facilitate  the\nimplementation  of  strategies  to  achieve  poverty  reduction  through  pro-poor,  broad-based\neconomic growth; social sector development; and targeted poverty reduction programs.\n5. Governance reforms are expected to have significant social impacts due to efficiencies\nin resource allocation and resource use. Human development indicators can be significantly\nimproved if social services in the areas of basic and primary education, basic general and\nreproductive health services, and safe drinking water can be provided effectively when needed.\nThe  economy's  growth  prospects  will  improve  as  the  reforms  begin  to  stimulate  revenue\ngeneration of the Government, better management of public expenditures, efficient and effective\nimplementation of development projects, and closer regulation of private sector activities to\npromote competition. A sustained high growth rate based on successful reform is a precondition\nfor poverty reduction.\n2. Impact on the Labor Market\n6. The impact on the labor market can be expected in both the number of employment\nopportunities and the quality of the labor force in terms of labor productivity. Reducing both the\nsize  of  the  bureaucracy  and  the  number  of  public  enterprises  will  create  structural\nunemployment. Retrenchment creates possible problems through the impact of voluntary early\nretirement schemes on the Government's financial position, and through early retirement of\nmore efficient personnel rather than redundant, inefficient staff. Hence, mass retrenchment\nshould be avoided, and personnel numbers should be gradually and selectively reduced. To\nretain valued personnel, a negative list may need to be developed to prevent such staff from\nleaving the civil service.\n7. Pay increases and a merit-based recruitment and promotion system will augment the\nefficiency of labor. As the pay structure of civil servants is extremely low, such reform measures\nwill improve their economic status. The privatization of noncore functions will possibly create\nunemployment. However, since many of the affected staff are likely to be hired by the private\nsector to provide the services, they will benefit from improved service delivery, and individual\nemployment will most likely to be positive. For those who are not easily absorbed by the private\nsector, training programs are required to minimize the impact of structural unemployment. Apart\nfrom the direct impact upon employment, indirect effects through better project implementation\nare  also  likely.  Delays  in  project  implementation  of  many  labor-intensive  infrastructure\ndevelopment programs could be expected to diminish and as a result the demand for such labor\nwill be steady and wage income more regular as projects are effectively implemented.\n3.  Impact on Prices of Goods and Services\n8. Experience in the past has shown that pay increases are often accompanied by a rise in\nthe prices of goods and services. This phenomenon was significantly reduced recently with the\nintroduction of a liberal economic policy seeking to diversify sources of supply of goods and", "67\nAppendix 8, Page 3\nservices, and making them more competitive. So pay hikes are likely to have a negligible\nnegative impact in terms of price rises.\n9. The privatization of noncore functions could raise the prices of such services, as such\nservices were previously available at a lower price, and at a lower efficiency level. However,\nincreased efficiency will gradually compensate for the increase in prices. It is a general trend\nworldwide to provide public services either free of cost or at unrealistically low prices. As service\ncharges  are  introduced  or  raised,  prices  of  such  services  are  bound  to  rise.  However,\nconsumers in Nepal have demonstrated in many sectors that they are willing to pay if they\nreceive better services on a sustained basis. To minimize the impact of such price increases on\nthe poorer income groups, prices can be increased at a differential rate\u2014higher rates for higher\nlevel of consumption of the goods and services under consideration.\n10. The reform measures could also lead to better delivery of economic services by some of\nthe public enterprises, resulting in price stabilization efforts as more efficient operations are\nachieved. At the moment, prices are raised on a regular basis to meet the interest on costs and\nother leakages. Such services include electricity, communications, and water supply.\n4.  Impact on Service Delivery\n11. A significant impact can be expected upon service delivery in terms of the timeliness and\nquality of service delivery. Despite the availability of physical facilities even in remote areas of\nthe country, these services are often very poor. Hence, any incentive to civil servants to deliver\nservices more effectively and efficiently through these service outlets will lead to an increase in\nhuman development indicators like literacy rate, infant and child mortality rates, and so on. They\nwill also help lower the maternal mortality rate and improve life expectancy levels. As the poorer\npeople mostly consume these public services, any efficiency gain in service delivery will directly\nbenefit the poor. For goods and services provided only by the public sector, differential price\npolicies are needed to protect the poorer groups.\n5. Impact on Public Social Expenditure\n12. Civil  service  reforms  by  themselves  will  not  have  much  impact  on  social  public\nexpenditure. In the context of the 20/20 compact,4 the Government is trying to increase public\nexpenditure for social priority sectors to the desired level. However, since there is evidence of\nallocated resources not being spent, increasing social public expenditure would be difficult, if not\nimpossible. In this context, the reform measures can contribute to better management of public\nexpenditure, and in the process the impact of these social priority programs will be enhanced.\n6. Impact on Participation and Empowerment\n13. The  other  significant  expected  impact  of  the  reforms  is  on  participation  and\nempowerment. There are different aspects of this possible impact. The Local Self-Governance\nAct has established the framework for active participation of local government bodies, and any\nreform  measures  now  have  the  potential  of  engaging  all  local  government  bodies  more\nproductively.  However,  due  to  weak  institutional  capacity,  the  local  government  bodies  by\nthemselves will not be able to take up the responsibilities. They can be expected to play a\ngreater role in the management and financing of primary schools and health services centers if\ncapacity-building assistance is provided to them.\n                  \n4 Agreed at the World Summit for Social Development, 6-12 March 1995 in Copenhagen, Denmark.", "68\nAppendix 8, Page 4\n14. Likewise, the governance reforms could result in greater participation and empowerment\nof socially excluded groups and women through capability-building measures, such as support\nfor courses to prepare targeted people to appear in the civil service and similar examinations.\nSimilar courses could be developed for the purpose of promotion. One other measure could be\nto make candidates from such targeted groups eligible to join the civil service once they pass\nthe written examination.\n7.  Impact on Poverty\n15. The governance reform measures will have significant impact upon poverty reduction.\nThe Government is the main service provider to poorer people. So any efficiency gain in\nproviding services in basic education, basic health services, and increasing access to safe\ndrinking water will reduce poverty. They will also boost labor productivity, providing a positive\nimpact upon incomes as well. Improving the quality of the services should be viewed as a\nmitigation measure to possible price increases or high prices of private sector service providers.\n16. The services provided by the private sector usually do not reach the poor people, but\nthey have the potential of releasing government resources to focus on specific target groups.\nMoreover, private sector involvement in providing services helps expand the number of jobs and\nin  the  process  create  employment  opportunities.  Enhancement  in  the  efficiency  of  public\nexpenditure management is expected to improve the absorption capacity of the social sector. It\nwill facilitate further allocation of public resources on these sectors and make these services\navailable to targeted groups and areas.\n17. Reducing implementation delays in infrastructure development programs will lessen the\nfluctuation in demand for labor and will make wage income more regular. Wage income is one\nof the major nonfarm income sources and is a coping strategy at the time of natural disasters.\nPrivatization of noncore functions of the Government and greater private sector involvement in\nproviding utility services, particularly in the urban areas, are likely to increase the prices of such\ngoods and services. They will increase the cost of living of the urban poor. To minimize such\nimpacts, services at the community level could be provided at reduced prices.\n8. Impact on Gender Issues\n18. Downsizing the bureaucracy, reducing the size of the teacher service, and transfer of\nsome functions to local authorities could reduce the total number of women civil servants,\nalthough perhaps not the percentage. However, women in general are expected to benefit\nsignificantly  by  way  of  efficient  service  delivery,  greater  access  to  services,  gender\nempowerment,  attempts  to  increase  female  representation  in  the  civil  service,  gender\nsensitization of the civil service and government policies and programs, and increased public\nsocial expenditure. As the number of women civil servants may be reduced, gender auditing\nand gender sensitization of government policies and programs are likely to suffer. To combat\nthis,  inclusion  of  a  gender  sensitization  component  in  different  training  programs,  and  a\nguideline to incorporate gender perspectives could minimize such impact, which is essentially\nshort term.

General Background\n1. Women  in  Nepal  lag  far  behind  men  in  social  development,  access  to  economic\nresources, and positions of power and decision-making roles. The adult female literacy rate is\nthe lowest in South Asia, and the maternal mortality rate is the highest. On the other hand,\nNepal's agriculture, particularly in the hills, depends largely on women. Women's share in the\nagricultural labor force increased from 45 percent in 1991 to 56 percent in 1999.1 Women are\nalso coming out to work in the industry and service sectors, constituting 31 percent of the non-\nagricultural labor force and 15 percent of the manufacturing labor force. Despite increasing\ninvolvement in the economy, women\u2019s participation in policy-making at higher levels, and their\nplacement in political, administrative, and managerial positions is very low. Nepal also lags far\nbehind  other  countries  on  many  indicators  concerning  women,  including  the  gender\ndevelopment index, even within the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation region\n(Table A9.1).\nTable A9.1: Selected Indicators of Women's Status (1997-1998)\nFemale Female % MMR (per Gender Women Women in\nPopulation Labor Force Literate 100,000 Development in Adm.& Civil\nCountry (% of (% of total) Female births) Index Mgt.

Given this situation, involving women in the development process on an equal footing\nwith men has been an issue of particular concern to the policy-makers in the country since the\nearly 1980s. The Sixth (1980-1985) and subsequent five-year plans have emphasized women's\ninvolvement in the developmental process on a more equitable basis. Particularly, after the\nadvent of democracy in Nepal in 1990, the five-year plans have emphasized the need for\nincreasing women's access to decision-making levels in all walks of life. But progress has been\nslow and the proportion of women in senior decision-making positions in the civil service and\npolitics  has  not  progressed  beyond  tokenism,  except  at  the  lowest  ladder  of  the  political\nhierarchy, the ward committees. This exception at the ward level was achieved by a blanket\nreservation of 20 percent of the seats for women.\n3. In light of the slow progress in mainstreaming women in the national development\nprocess and to conform to the Beijing Platform for Action (1995), in the current Ninth Plan\n(1997\u20132002) the Government changed its approach to gender issues. Policies enunciated in\nthe Plan are divided under mainstreaming, eliminating gender inequality, and empowerment.\n                  \n1Central Bureau of Statistics: Population Monograph of Nepal, 1994 and Nepal Labor Force Survey 1998/99, 2000.", "71\nAppendix 9, page  2\nAmong other things, mandatory representation of women in the formulation of policies and\nprograms at all levels and affirmative action have been promised, as empowerment of women\npresupposes the participation of women in the overall governance process of the country.\n4. The  Constitution  of  Nepal  (1990),  while  embodying  the  principles  of  equality  of  all\ncitizens, irrespective of their religion, race, sex, caste, ethnicity, etc., recognizes the specific\nresponsibilities of the state towards the development of women and other disadvantaged groups\n(Article 26.7, 9 and 10). Moreover, the Government has repeatedly committed itself to taking the\nnecessary measures to implement this responsibility in several international conventions and\ndeclarations, including the Beijing Plan of Action.\nB.  Women in Nepal's Civil Service \u2014 Current Status\n5. In spite of numerous policy declarations and government commitments, the issue of\nincreasing  female  representation  in  the  civil  service  has  not  received  serious  mainstream\nattention so far. The administrative reform commissions, which have produced several reports,\nhave  assumed  the  civil  service  to  be  gender  neutral.  On  the  other  hand,  the  cabinet  has\napproved a Nepal National Strategy (1997) for the implementation of the Beijing Plan of Action,\nwhich  explicitly  specifies  the  need  for  affirmative  action  and  recommends  a  20  percent\nreservation of civil service positions at all levels.\n6. The Government has also initiated certain measures to promote women's entry into and\npromotion  through  the  civil  service,  by  including  special  provisions  on  women  in  the  Civil\nService Act (1993). These provisions give women a five-year concession on entry age (35 years\nfor men and 40 years for women), a six-month advantage in the probation period (one year\nagainst six months), and a one-year advantage regarding the minimum period of service for\npromotions. The act also requires joint posting of spouses in the same district if both are in\ngovernment  service.  To  improve  women  candidates'  capacity  to  take  the  Public  Service\nCommission  (PSC)  examinations,  some  preparatory  courses  have  been  organized  since\nDecember 1996 for Class Three level positions in the administrative service on the initiative of\nthe Ministry of Women, Children, and Social Welfare (MOWCSW).\n7. In the meantime, women's representation in the civil service has continued to remain at\nless then 9 percent in total, and less then 5 percent at the policy level (Table A9.2).  Moreover,\nthe rate of increase in their proportion has been slow, particularly at the decision-making  level\n(3 percent in 1978, and 5 percent in 2001). A matter of greater concern is the fact that there has\nbeen a decline between 1999 and 2001. The intake of women in the civil service is minimal, and\npromotions have been negligible. After the current pool of first class and second class women\nofficers retire in the next 2 \u2013 3 years, this proportion is expected to decline further. For example,\nbetween 1995/96 and 1999/2000, 544 persons were recommended by the PSC for officer level\nintake to the Administrative Service. Only eight of them (1.4 percent) were women. All of them\nwere for the third class level.  Of the 56 recommendations for Class II and I, none was a woman,\ndespite the fact that eight women had taken the examination for Class II and 14 for Class I.", "72\nAppendix 9, page  3\nTable A9.2: Percent Women in the Civil Service (1978-2001)\nPositions 1978 1993 1999 June 2001\nGazetted Officersa 3.23 4.39 5.16 5.12\nSpecial and First (Policy Level) 1.00 2.31 4.87 4.02\nSecond 2.49 4.48 3.16 5.04\nThird 3.66 4.54 5.24 5.34\nNongazetted (Support Staff)b 2.37 na 8.20 8.93\nTotal 2.62 na 7.81 8.55\nna = not available.\na Gazetted class is the officer or professional staff.\nb Nongazetted class is support staff.\nSources: MOWCSW, 2000; MOWCSW: Beijing Plus Five -Country Report, 2001; MOWCSW, unpublished data for 2001; Acharya, M:\nStatistical Profile of Nepalese Women, 1979; Acharya, M.: Gender Equity and Empowerment of Women, 1997, Kathmandu.\n8. Similarly, 120 officers were promoted from Class III to Class II overall in the civil service,\nbut none was a woman, while among the 61 persons promoted from Class II to Class I, there\nwas only one woman. Further, in April 2001, 17 secretary level positions were filled. No woman\nfigured in the shortlist. It seems that relatively few women apply for entry to the civil service,\nespecially at higher levels, and even fewer succeed. In the PSC entry examinations for Class III\nofficers for the Administrative Service discussed above, among nearly 57,000 applicants, only 4\npercent were women, despite the fact that in 1991 women constituted about 18 percent of the\ngraduate population.\nC.  Constraints on Entry and Promotions in PSC\n1.  Entry\n9. In the last few years several studies have tried to analyze why few women apply for the\nPSC examinations and fewer succeed. The promotion process and the examination process\nhave also been analyzed in some detail, with stakeholder involvement.2 Common constraints on\nwomen's entry into and promotions in the civil service that emerge from these studies are\nsummarized below.\n10. Social Attitudes. Marriage and children are still considered the first priority for women,\neducated or not. This pressures families to marry their daughters by the time they are in their\nearly twenties. By the time women are ready to take entry examinations, mostly they are married\nand engaged in rearing children, which leaves little time to prepare for the competitive PSC\nexaminations for government jobs.  A rearing that prepares girls to accept only a secondary role\nin  public  life  creates  lack  of  confidence  among  women  and  their  family  members  on  their\ncapacity to compete and to succeed in the PSC examination.\n11. Market Conditions. The low percentage of female graduates and the tough competition\nin the PSC examinations also result in low female application rates for civil service jobs. Growing\njob opportunities in the teaching and other nongovernment sectors including the private sector\noffer women a better work environment and facilities. This has resulted in a lack of interest in\n                  \n2 Adhikary, Women in the Civil Service 1998; MOWCSW: Gender Dimensions in Civil Service, 2000; SAHAVAGI,\nEngendering the Nepalese Civil Service with Specific Reference to Entry in Administrative Services and Promotion\nSystem , 2001.", "73\nAppendix 9, page  4\ngovernment  jobs  among  urban  women,  who  have  the  necessary  educational  prerequisites,\nwhereas their rural counterparts lack the required qualifications. Parents who are in the civil\nservice also provide a negative impression of the civil service, complaining about the low pay\nand rampant favoritism and nepotism.\n12. Work Environment. The work environment in government jobs is not perceived to be\nwoman-friendly. Women government officers complain that their male colleagues and superiors\nunderestimate the capabilities of female staff.  Stagnation of women officers in lower positions for\na long time compared with their male colleagues due to gender-biased promotion criteria also\ncreates an image problem, even for those women graduates who want to join the public service.\nLack of flexibility in work hours and other facilities such as adequate leave and physical facilities\n(daycare centers, toilets, etc.) discourage women further from joining the civil service.\n13. PSC Examination System. The PSC examinations, up until the recent past, even when\nrevisions were introduced, were outdated, vague, wide in scope, and not favorable to fresh\ngraduates. The questions, focused especially on general knowledge and social studies, are\nmemory testing type questions, rather than testing the capacity of the candidates. Women\ncandidates have less time to memorize these facts and figures. Further, the requirement to write\nthe  examination  in  Nepali  while  university  education  is  mostly  in  English,  the  practice  of\nallocating  additional  marks  for  higher  divisions  in  academic  qualifications  and  to  additional\ndegrees at the oral interview even after being called for an interview, and lack of examination\ncenters  at  the  regional  level  all  combine  to  discourage  women  from  taking  the  PSC\nexaminations. All of these constraints are applicable to male aspirants from rural areas and\ndisadvantaged groups as well, but they hinder women more than men because of the social\nconstraints on their mobility and their household responsibilities. Lack of sufficient preparation\ntime due to the system of holding examinations immediately after the two important festivals in\nNepal is also a further reason why few women apply for civil service openings.\n2.  Promotions\n14. The major factor responsible for the lower promotion rate of women as compared with\nmen emerging from almost all stakeholder surveys and studies is the current marking system.\nThe  system  of  allocating  more  marks  for  higher  academic  qualifications  (bachelor  versus\nadvanced degrees) and training diplomas has put women in a disadvantageous position because\nfewer women have advanced degrees. They are unable to compete with men on an equal\nfooting in this respect if they had no master's level degree at the time of their entry into the\nservice.\nD.  Likely Impact of the Governance Reform Program\n1.  Overall Impact\n15. Some of the elements in the reform program such as reducing corruption, limiting the\nnumber  of  ministries  and  departments,  statutory  boards  and  authorities,  and  the  staff\ndevelopment efforts will benefit women no matter how they are designed. To make them more\ngender sensitive, efforts must be made to include the maximum possible number of women in\nthe  institutions  being  considered  and  to  provide  gender  training  to  the  whole  civil  service\nestablishment. Major problems may arise when the issues at stake are \u201crightsizing\u201d and freezing\nrecruitment, and designing procedures for staff evaluation.", "74\nAppendix 9, page  5\n2. Women's Representation in the Civil Service\n   16. The  proportion  of  women  in  decision-making  levels  is  one  of  the  most  important\nindicators of their empowerment. Their representation at decision-making levels in the civil\nservice is important not only on equity grounds but also on efficiency grounds. Women constitute\nhalf of the nation, and involvement of the stakeholders in policies and programs must include\nthem for program efficiency. Thus, increasing female representation in the civil service is an\nimportant intervention for female empowerment and equitable development. Prioritizing gender\nissues in the civil service implies simultaneous interventions in three areas: (i) increasing the\nrepresentation of women in the civil service; (ii) reforming the acts, regulations, rules, and\nprocesses to facilitate gender-balanced development; and (iii) beginning a process to change the\nattitude  of  those  who  are  in  decision-making  roles.  An  administrative  reform  designed  to\noverhaul  the  whole  system,  with  both  short-  and  long-term  perspectives,  must  be  gender\nresponsive and plan interventions in all three directions within the framework of the overall\nreform.\n17. The freezing of recruitment will close all entry possibilities for women. Rightsizing will\nalso  mean  a  reduction  in  staff  numbers  and  transfers  of  staff  and  their  functions  to  local\nauthorities. These transfers will probably reduce women's representation in the civil service at\ndecision-making levels, as a majority of women at higher levels within the civil service are in\ntechnical services in the three pilot ministries (Agriculture and Cooperatives, Education and\nSports, and Health).\nE.  Implementation Mechanisms\n18. The  administrative  reforms  coordination  and  monitoring  committee  and  executive\ncommittee should include the minister of MWCSW and the secretary of MOWCSW to provide\ncontinuous gender input to the reform program. Similarly, a gender focal point should be included\nin the Governance Reform Coordination Unit in the Ministry of Genral Administration, and the\nEfficiency Unit in the Ministry of Finance.\n19. Terms of reference for the management teams in ministries and departments to be\ncreated to manage and implement reform must provide for gender focal points. These teams\nshould also include representatives of women's units in departments and ministries where they\nexist. Consultations with internal stakeholders on reforms must include women's representatives.\nF.  Monitoring Arrangements\n20. All  monitoring  mechanisms  designed  under  the  reform    program    should    contain\ngender-disaggregated information and gender impact analysis. MOWCSW should create a unit\nfor monitoring the governance reform program or assign specific responsibility to an existing unit."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20011107124742", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Author": "j3m", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R206-01rrp.doc", "ModDate": "D:20011127154740+08'00'"}}
