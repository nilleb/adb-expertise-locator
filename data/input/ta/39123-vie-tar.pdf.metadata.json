The Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam is currently preparing a new 5-\nyear  socioeconomic  development  plan  (SEDP)  2006\u20132010,  for  approval  by  the  National \nAssembly by mid-2006. The SEDP will integrate the Government\u2019s comprehensive poverty \nreduction and growth strategy (CPRGS) and Viet Nam Development Goals (VDGs). The SEDP \nwill become Viet Nam\u2019s national strategy for poverty reduction. The Government requested the  \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to provide a technical assistance (TA) grant to help Dak Nong \nprovince to improve its poverty reduction and growth performance by strengthening capacity in \nsocioeconomic development planning. The leaders of the province pursued the request during \nthe seminar to discuss the findings of a joint study on sustainable poverty reduction and growth \nin the Central Highlands region by ADB and the Development Strategy Institute, Ministry of \nPlanning and Investment (MPI), in Kom Tum in February 2005. A TA Fact-Finding Mission was \nfielded on 25\u201328 May 2005 to discuss with the Government counterparts and finalize the design \nof the TA. The Mission discussed and reached understanding with the Government on the goal, \npurpose  and  outputs,  methodology  and  key  activities,  cost  and  financing,  implementation \narrangements,  and  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  TA.  The  TA  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Viet Nam\u2019s impressive record of reducing poverty in recent years, particularly halving \npoverty within a decade, is largely attributed to its strong economic growth performance. The \nGovernment is committed to further reducing poverty down to about 16% of households by \n2010. It is, however, perceived that addressing the poor below the national poverty line would \nbe  a  difficult  task  as  they  are  located  in  remote  highlands  and  mountains.  Similarly,  the \nimpressive  gains  in  poverty  reduction  are  still  fragile  and  the  significant  proportion  of  the \npopulation,  especially  the  ethnic  minorities,  who  are  just  above  the  poverty  line  remain \nvulnerable to shocks, which could push them back below the poverty line. The Government has \nrecognized that to sustain high economic growth and poverty reduction rates and to make them \nmore socially inclusive, it would need to intensify its decentralization efforts by devolving more \nresponsibilities  to  provinces  and  also  introducing  planning  reforms.2  In  the  process  of \ndeveloping SEDP 2006\u20132010, the Government expects local governments to generate good \nquality plans as well as improve their capacity to implement those plans. As such the new SEDP \nwill also incorporate elements of the CPRGS and VDGs. \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s new country strategy and program (CSP), which is being aligned to the new \nSEDP,  envisages  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  decentralization  efforts  of  devolving  more \nresponsibilities to provinces. The CSP will have a sharper geographic focus on addressing \nissues  related  to  provincial-level  development  strategy,  policies  and  programs,  institutional \ncapabilities,  and  investment  requirements,  especially  along  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion \n(GMS) economic corridors such as the East\u2013West Economic Corridor and the Development \nTriangle.3  The  Central  Highlands  is  expected  to  benefit  from  these  regional  cooperation \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet Edition) on 20 June 2005. \n2  Directive 33/ TTg dated 24 September 2004 by the Prime Minister, and Circular 2215/ MPI state the need to ensure \nquality economic growth through design of quality development plans. This objective requires new and innovative \nplanning approaches. The 2004 budget law confirms that decentralization to local governments is required for \nresource allocation and investment. The draft new investment law also delegates decision making for business \ninvestment approval to lower levels. \n3  The Government of Viet Nam has developed a master plan for the Development Triangle and has strategized \neconomic zoning for the Central Highlands region to link with the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) \nand Cambodia. \n ", "2   \nactivities.  To  strengthen  the  regional  initiative  at  country  level,  including  the  results-based \nmanagement approach, ADB will help local governments link up and catch up with the current \ndevelopment pace in the region as well as formulate results-oriented development plans. Pilot \nexercises in selected provinces are envisaged to generate a model that could be replicated in \nother poor provinces. They will also help ADB formulate its investment products using the TA \nresults. \n \n4.  Dak Nong is among the poorest provinces in the Central Highlands and ranks 9th   \npoorest among the 63 provinces of Viet Nam. Poverty prevalence in the province is estimated at \n48% of the households in 2004 as per the new definition of the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and \nSocial Affairs (MOLISA). Dak Nong is a new province, created in 2004 and separated from Dak \nLak, another of the poorest provinces in the region. Dak Nong has 6 districts and 52 communes. \nHalf of the 52 communes are under the Government\u2019s targeted program for poor communes \n(i.e. Program 135).4 A third of Dak Nong\u2019s 418,000 population comprise ethnic minorities (both \nindigenous and recent immigrants) and constitute 31 different groups. With a total land area of \n651,000 hectares, coffee, rubber, cashew nuts, sugarcane, bauxite mining characterize the \nprovincial economy. Many parts of Dak Nong often suffer from droughts and floods although the \nprovince is also endowed with hydropower potential. About 38 state-owned enterprises (26 of \nthem  in  forestry),  294  private  enterprises,  952  household  businesses,  51  cooperative \nhouseholds, and 5 foreign enterprises (mainly in tea and coffee processing) operate in the \nprovince. The private sector contributes 88% of the province\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). \n \n5.  The key issues and challenges facing the province include (i) entrenched poverty, which \nis also related to the ethnic minorities that constitute 34% of Dak Nong\u2019s population, and in-\nmigration; (ii) heavy dependence on traditional crops for livelihood; (iii) low level of investment; \nand (iv) lack of investment to exploit mineral (bauxite) resources. The issues are attributed to \nthe fact that the province does not have the capacity nor the resources to design and implement \nappropriate development plans for delivery of basic services and mobilize resources for growth \nand  poverty  reduction.  As  such  the  province  is  constrained  to  effectively  support  the \ndecentralization process. Dak Nong has very limited qualified staff and adequate administrative \nfacilities. Though about a third of its personnel (from all departments) was transferred from Dak \nLak during the separation last year and 20 new employee recruited recently to work at the \nDepartment of Planning and Investment (DPI), the personnel need urgent training to help \nimplement  the  province\u2019s  long-term  development  strategy  and  plans.  To  promote  fast  but \ninclusive growth and poverty reduction, the province needs qualified staff and well-resourced \ninstitutions to (i) create an environment conducive to business and investment enforced with \nappropriate laws and regulations; (ii) implement an effective system of public services (health \ncare, education, basic services for the poor and ethnic minority); and (iii) maintain public goods, \nparticularly physical infrastructure and natural resources. The provincial authority has shown a \nhigh level of commitment to changes and identified the needs for improvement, specifically in \npolicies, institutional arrangements, and management capacity building to ensure sustainable \npoverty reduction and growth of the province to reach the level of other provinces in the region. \n \n6.  Since  2003,  ADB  has  been  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  national  program  for \nstrengthening provincial development planning and rolling out of the CPRGS at provincial level, \n                                                 \n4  Program 135 (also referred to as support to poor communes) and the new poverty reduction program (formerly \nhunger eradication and poverty reduction [HEPR]) are the two major target programs of the Government. Phase 2 \nof these programs will continue during 2006\u20132010 and will cover housing, education, health, credit support, \ninfrastructure development, and capacity building. Decentralization in program implementation is required to \nimprove its effectiveness.   \n ", "  3\nmainly in Dak Nong and Gia Lai provinces through the TA4163-VIE and TA4252-VIE.5 These \nTAs and related activities have produced reports on lessons learned6 and training modules for \nsocioeconomic planning at local levels. The reports stress the need for capacity enhancement \nof local officials in strategic planning, poverty and governance assessment, and investment \nneeds survey. The reports also analyzed the importance of local ownership in implementing \nreforms and decentralization. The cited TAs have successfully raised awareness on the issues \nand helped local leaders to identify the needed follow-up actions.7 In that context, Dak Nong \nprovince was selected for its urgent needs and new administrative setup. To prepare the scaling \nof  planning  reforms  at  all  levels,  ADB  is  working  with  MPI,  together  with  other  official \ndevelopment assistance (ODA) partners, in preparing a planning handbook for socioeconomic \ndevelopment for use by provinces. The handbook will be useful for implementing the proposed \nTA.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The goal of the TA project is to support Dak Nong province in strengthening its capacity \nfor socioeconomic development planning to improve poverty reduction and economic growth \nperformance. Its purpose is to assist the provincial people\u2019s committee (PPC) and department of \nplanning  and  investment  (DPI)  in  (i)  training  key  officials  in  socioeconomic  development \nplanning, results-based management, public investment planning, service delivery and other \nrelated  areas;  (ii)  implementing  its  SEDP,  particularly  in  preparing  annual  socioeconomic \ndevelopment plans, taking into account gender and ethnic minority dimensions; (iii) undertaking \nsector studies to identify investable projects and project/program financing alternatives (with \nstate,  private,  and  foreign  resources);  and  (iv)  proactively  promoting  activities  for  inward \ninvestment. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.   The TA will adopt a process approach whereby the TA will be designed and its tasks \nimplemented in close consultation with provincial leaders and government officials. The process \napproach will also provide learning-by-doing opportunities for provincial leaders and government \nofficials. Top priority will be given to training provincial officials, including the recently recruited \nofficers, in areas of strategic socioeconomic development planning, results-based management, \nresource  mobilization,  development  finance,  inward  investment  promotion,  agriculture \ndiversification, and sustainable community development (including the ethnic minorities). The \nteam  of  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  develop  detailed  curricula  and  training \nmodules  in  consultation  with  Dak  Nong  provincial  leaders,  MPI,  and  ADB.  Lessons   from \nprevious TAs, the planning handbook (being prepared by MPI), existing and new sector study \nreports, and the training modules developed under TA4163 and TA4252 (footnote 5) will provide \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2003.

The training activities will then be rolled down to districts and communes. The \nTA will reorient and retrain government officials to be more efficient and proactive in delivering \nservices,  mobilizing  revenues,  and  promoting  private  sector  investment.  A  competitiveness \nindex will be prepared, following the methodology developed by the Viet Nam Chamber of \nCommerce and Industry, to recently assess the provincial competitiveness of 40 provinces and \ncities in Viet Nam. \n \n9.   Expected Development Results/Outcomes. The main expected development results \nof the TA for Dak Nong would be significant improvement in poverty reduction and growth. In \nthe short term, the TA will contribute to achieving (i) adoption of CPRGS elements (participatory \nand bottom-up process, results-based approach, social inclusion, etc.) in local planning; (ii) \nimprovement in the business environment and proactive inward investment promotion activities; \nand (iii) strengthened institutional capabilities to undertake policy analysis, sector studies, and \nresults-based socioeconomic development planning and management. \n \n10.  Major Expected Outputs. The major outputs of the TA will be (i) training workshops for \nprovincial-level government officials; (ii) training modules, seminar proceedings, and guidelines \non results-based and strategic socioeconomic development planning and management; (iii) \nsector studies on selected sectors (e.g., agriculture crop diversification, livestock, community \ndevelopment,  investment  promotion,  etc.);  (iv)  competitive  index  of  Dak  Nong;  (v) \nguide/brochure  on  investment  opportunities  in  Dak  Nong;  and  (vi)  trade  and  investment \nmeetings. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $812,000  equivalent,  comprising  foreign \nexchange  of  $240,000  and  local  currency  equivalent  of  $572,000.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance $650,000 equivalent, comprising $240,000 in foreign exchange and \n$410,000 equivalent in local currency. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the ADB- \nadministered  Poverty  Reduction  Cooperation  Fund  in  the  amount  of  $325,000  and  the \nCooperation  Fund  in  Support  of  the  Formulation  and  Implementation  of  National  Poverty \nReduction Strategies in the amount of $325,000. The Government will finance the balance of \nthe  local  currency  costs,  amounting  to  $162,000  equivalent  in  kind  to  cover  office \naccommodation,  counterpart  staff,  administrative  and  logistic  support,  and  other  required \nservices. Details of the TA cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The TA project will be implemented over a 2-year period. Its implementation will require \n(i) 10 person-months of international consulting services on an intermittent basis, in the fields of \nstrategic development planning and results-based management, crop diversification, investment \npromotion, ethnic minority development, resource mobilization, and training; and (ii) about 36 \nperson-months of domestic consulting services. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix \n3.  National and provincial universities, research institutes, and nongovernment organizations \nwill be considered for undertaking some envisaged activities. Consultants will be engaged as \nindividuals  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. ADB\u2019s Viet Nam Resident \nMission (VRM) will administer the TA in close consultation with MPI, and the PPC and DPI of \nDak Nong province. \n \n13.  The PPC of Dak Nong province will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The PPC will \nbe responsible for overall coordination and management of the project at the provincial level, \n ", "  5\nincluding  (i)  coordinating  with  ADB  and  other  government  agencies  and  (ii)  ensuring  the \nnecessary  national-level  approvals  are  obtained  in  a  timely  manner,  to  facilitate  project \nimplementation. The DPI will be responsible for project implementation. The Project will be \nmanaged through the provincial project management unit (PPMU) to be established at the DPI. \nCoordination  will  be  provided  through  a  project  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  vice \nchairman of the Dak Nong PPC. Committee members will include a deputy director-level official \nof the Foreign Economic Relations Department of MPI, a deputy director of the Regional and \nLocal Planning Department of MPI, selected provincial sectoral departments, and VRM. The \nsteering committee will meet at least biannually to review implementation progress and guide \nthe project activities.   \n \n14.   Evaluation  of  the  implementation  process  and  initial  outcomes  of  targeted  poverty \nreduction will be carried out through (i) periodic reviews of the province\u2019s public investment \nplans and provincial budgets, and (ii) participatory assessment by the stakeholders to ensure \nthat an adequate percentage of investments targeted the poor or related activities. Likewise, the \nPPMU will ensure that resource allocation is prioritized and directed at financing the planned \ntargeted interventions. Implementation progress including initial outcomes in poverty reduction \nor on the lives of the poor will be circulated to all stakeholders through annual reports. ADB and \nthe Government will carry out joint annual reviews. The consultants will prepare and submit (i) \nan inception report within 2 weeks of the start of the TA; (ii) quarterly progress reports and (iii) a \nfinal report at project/assignment completion.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering (i) technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $325,000 to be financed \non a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund to the Government of the Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam for Capacity Building Support to Dak Nong Province for Improving Poverty \nReduction and Growth Performance, and (ii) technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent \nof  $325,000  to  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Cooperation  Fund  in  Support  of  the \nFormulation and Implementation of National Poverty Reduction Strategies for Capacity Building \nSupport to Dak Nong Province for Improving Poverty Reduction and Growth Performance, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/    Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms and Risks  \n       \nImpact       \nStrengthened capacity of  \u2022 Poverty reduction  \u2022 Five-year and annual   \nDak Nong province in  and growth  provincial performance   \nsocioeconomic  indicators of the  reports   \ndevelopment planning to  province improve.     \nimprove poverty reduction    \u2022 TA review reports   \nand growth performance  \u2022 Province\u2019s annual     \n  plans more  \u2022 Joint review reports (ADB   \n  strategically  and MPI and Dak Nong   \n  address poverty  PPC)   \n  reduction and     \n   growth issues. \nOutcome (short-term)      Assumptions \n1.
