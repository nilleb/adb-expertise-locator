Efforts to reform the Government\u2019s financial information system in the Fiji Islands began \nin 1994 when the Ministry of Finance initiated the Accrual Accounting Project. The project was \npostponed due to implementation difficulties and was subsequently subsumed by the Financial \nManagement Reform (FMR) Project in 1998. The FMR was supported by the New Zealand \nAgency for International Development,1 culminating in the preparation and enactment of the \nPublic Finance Management Act (PFMA) of 1999. The FMR provides the Government with the \nconceptual and institutional framework to better implement its policies, and to deliver public \ngoods and services more efficiently and effectively. The FMR is an important element of the \npublic sector reform agenda. \n \n2.  The Government initiated parallel public administration and public enterprise reforms \nwith the enactment of the Public Enterprise Act of 1996 and the Public Service Act of 1999. \nImplementation of these two pieces of legislation was supported with technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Australian Agency for International Development and the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB).2 After its enactment in March 1999, the PFMA was suspended in August 1999 following \na change of government. ADB provided assistance to the then government to review the scope \nand implementation plan in late 1999. The review report emphasized the need to press ahead \nwith a revised FMR, taking into account resource and capacity constraints as well as risk \nmanagement  considerations.  Recognizing  the  urgency  of  proceeding  with  FMR,  the  newly \nelected Government in September 2001 approved a broad FMR implementation strategy. In \nview  of  limited  resources  and  the  lack  of  technical  expertise  within  the  public  sector,  the \nGovernment requested ADB\u2019s assistance during the 2002 country programming mission to \nreactivate  the  implementation  of  the  PFMA.  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  was  undertaken  in \nFebruary 2003. The TA3 framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Over the years, there has been increasing recognition by public officials of inefficient and \nineffective public resource management. The main problem is that traditional public resource \nmanagement focuses on inputs and compliance rather than achievement of outputs and results. \nLike most other public administration systems, the Fiji Islands\u2019 administrative and financial \nmanagement systems are designed to control the actions of ministers and public servants to \nensure  compliance  with  rules,  procedures,  and  budget  appropriations,  and  ignore  the  key \naspects of performance, accountability, and transparency. \n \n4.  Reforms  relating  to  the  public  enterprise  sector  and  public  administration  through \nimplementation of the Public Enterprise Act of 1996 and the Public Service Act of 1999 have \nhad some beneficial effects on other areas such as the recognition of performance and results, \nand enhanced disclosure of selected information in the annual budget papers. The suspension \nof the PFMA in 1999 created a disconnect between various elements of a sequenced set of \nreforms. The absence of strategic control of different aspects of the reform agenda by central \nagencies has also created some overlap of functions and unintended negative consequences of \nactions  at  the  working  level.  For  example,  the  Public  Service  Act  of  1999  requires  the \n                                                 \n1  Formerly New Zealand Official Development Assistance. \n2  ADB. 1996.

It also requires a chief executive to enter into a \nperformance contract with the portfolio minister, who would hold the chief executive accountable \nfor the performance of staff and the ministry as a whole, financially and administratively. This \nrequirement was implemented in January 2003. However, it may be unreasonable to hold the \nchief executive fully accountable for performance and results without the support of an output-\nbased budget management system proposed under the PFMA, and without control over staff \nrecruitment and dismissal. \n \n5.  The key objectives of the PFMA are to (i) improve the public financial management \nsystem of the State; and (ii) enhance the financial accountability of Parliament, the cabinet, \nministers,  public  officers,  and  public  entities.  The  PFMA  addresses  all  major  financial \nmanagement issues that are critical for sound fiscal policies and is seen as reflecting best \npractice  in  financial  and  economic  management  internationally.  The  more  controversial \nprovisions  of  the  PFMA  relate  to  the  move  towards  performance  budgeting  and  accrual \naccounting, and the purchaser/provider arrangement between ministers and their agencies. \nRelated provisions of the above concepts comprise a significant part of the Act. The passage of \ntime  since the  drafting  of  the  PFMA,  and  lessons learned  in  the implementation  of  these \nprinciples in the Pacific and elsewhere in the world have raised concerns about their excessive \ncomplexity and sophistication, given the current state of fiscal management, and the availability \nof resources and skills in the Fiji Islands. \n \n6.  The  current  public  finance  management  system  defines  the  roles  of  Parliament, \nministers, and public entities almost solely in terms of inputs, with its attendant emphasis on \ncompliance with cash budget appropriations. The continuation of the current system unchanged \nis clearly inconsistent with the intent of FMR and with reforms in other parts of the public sector. \nOn  the  other  hand,  many  of  the  provisions  of  the  suspended  PFMA  do  not  seem  to  be \nappropriate to the needs of the Fiji Islands at this time or in the foreseeable future, especially \ngiven the scarcity of resources and skills that are needed to implement such a comprehensive \nfiscal and financial management framework. \n \n7.  While  the Government  has  made  clear its commitment  to  improve  the  productivity, \naccountability, and transparency of public finance management, it also realizes that a strategic \nreview of the components of its reform agenda is warranted, as is the need to take account of \ncapacity building in terms of enhancing systems, management, accounting, and information \ntechnology skills to ensure successful implementation and sustainability of reforms over the \nlonger term. The Government has sought assistance to reactivate the FMR Project based on \nglobal experience and lessons learned from the region. Specifically, assistance is needed to \nreview the PFMA to assess its current adequacy and appropriateness for the Fiji Islands' \ncircumstances and to establish a detailed action plan that will sequence and pace the major \ncomponents of the financial management reform in a revised PFMA. \n \n8.  The  objectives  of  a  good  public  financial  management  system  are  to  ensure  the \nsoundness of public finances; increase the efficiency and effectiveness of fiscal activities; and \npromote  transparency,  accountability,  and  legitimacy  in  government  financial  transactions. \nProperly designed and implemented, a good financial management system will result in a \nbetter-informed public debate about the objectives and results of the Government\u2019s strategic \npolicies and financial management, and make government and its institutions more accountable \nfor  the  use  of  public  financial  resources.  The  Government\u2019s  broad  FMR  provides  a  firm \nfoundation, and success will depend on the effective implementation of a revised PFMA. \n ", "    3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  The TA will support a review of the PFMA, taking into account resource and capacity \nconstraints and the progress of reform activities in other areas of the public sector since the \nPFMA was enacted in early 1999, and will make recommendations for revised legislation. Upon \nthe enactment of the bill, the emphasis of the TA will be on (i) improving fiscal management \nthrough  better  management  of  public  expenditure  and  revenue  to  achieve  desired  social \noutcomes, and (ii) enhancing government and managerial accountability through timely and \ncomprehensive reporting of government finances.    \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The TA will finance the provision of consulting services to assist the Government in (i) \nreviewing the PFMA, and will make recommendations on major components of a revised bill; (ii) \npreparing a detailed implementation plan that focuses on government priorities, a realistic and \nsustainable timetable of system development, capacity building, and change management;  (iii) \nassisting the implementation steering committee, on an intermittent basis, to monitor progress \nand recommend corrective actions as appropriate, and (iv) providing specific technical advice to \nthe Ministry of Finance and Planning and the steering committee. \n \n11.  The  key  outputs  of  the  TA  will  be  the  drafting  instructions  for  a  new  financial \nmanagement bill to underpin FMR; and an implementation plan that should be realistic and \nachievable, taking into account the capacity and resource constraints of the Ministry of Finance \nand Planning and line agencies. In addition, the TA will provide training materials in public \nsector financial management that contain modern concepts and principles that are appropriate \nto the Fiji Islands\u2019 circumstances and that achieve the Government's policy objectives. As the \nintroduction of the FMR will require reorientation of public officials from inputs to a focus on \nperformance and results, which requires a different approach to management and managerial \naccountability, it is important that the implementation plan remain flexible to take account of \nprogress and unavoidable delays. Thus, the transfer of project management skills to a local \ncounterpart will be critical to ensure sustainability of the plan. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will be undertaken in two phases. Phase one will (i) assess the current status of \npublic sector reform activities that would require immediate FMR actions to support these \nelements (for example, the need to reorient the budget to incorporate meaningful outputs and \nperformance indicators to support the operation of the chief executives and senior executive \nservices); (ii) review and prioritize the components of the suspended PFMA in accordance with \ngovernment policy objectives and taking account of the skills and resource constraints of the \nMinistry of Finance and Planning and line agencies; (iii) recommend changes to the PFMA and \nother related legislation, as appropriate, for approval by the cabinet; (iv) prepare a detailed \nimplementation  plan  with  specific  assessment  of  risk,  internal  and  external  resource \nrequirements (human, systems, and training), and a realistic timetable for each component of \nthe revised legislation; and (v) develop a change management and communication plan to \nensure understanding, support, and commitment of stakeholders. \n \n13.  Phase two of the TA will start after the revised legislation is passed by Parliament, and \nwill  involve  the  establishment  of  an  implementation  steering  committee  comprising  senior \nofficials  of  central  agencies  (including  the  auditor  general\u2019s  office) and  line  agencies.  The \ncommittee will be supported by a public financial management consultant who has technical ", "4 \nexpertise and project management experience in this area. As the implementation is expected \nto be long term (3\u20135 years), the consultant will be supported by a local counterpart who will be \ntrained to take over the management of the project at the end of the term of the consultant\u2019s \ncontract  (expected to be within 24 months from TA commencement). The consultant, with the \nsupport of the financial management training specialist, will be responsible for the development \nof  technical  training  (in  public  expenditure  management,  performance-based  budget \nmanagement, accounting and financial reporting, and internal control systems) based on the \nspecific budgeting and financial information requirements of the revised PFMA, and will assist in \nthe development of a \u201ctrain-the-trainers\u201d program. It is expected that the training program will be \ndeveloped in conjunction with a local educational institution (for example the University of the \nSouth Pacific) to ensure that training will be ongoing and delivered during the transitional and \npost-implementation periods. The TA will also provide for short-term consulting services on \nspecific technical components included in the implementation plan. \n \n14.  As the implementation will be spread over a 3-year period at a minimum, it is imperative \nthat the Ministry of Finance and Planning and line agencies be committed to the process, so as \nto ensure, in particular, the availability and continuity of local counterparts to manage the \nimplementation and to participate in training programs. In addition, government decisions on \npolicies and funding needed for implementation should be adhered to, as far as practicable, to \nensure that early gains are realized given the long lead time of implementation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at US$620,000 equivalent, of which US$460,000 is \nthe foreign exchange cost and US$160,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. ADB will \nfinance the total foreign exchange cost, and the Government will finance the local currency \ncomponent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Ministry of Finance and Planning will be the Executing Agency of the TA. An \nimplementation  steering  committee  will  be  established  consisting  of  representatives  of  the \nMinistry  of  Finance  and  Planning,  the  Public  Service  Commission,  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s \nDepartment, line agencies of large spending ministries (such as Health, Education, and Works), \nsmaller ministries (such as Justice and Labor), and budget-dependent statutory agencies (such \nas the Ombudsman). The Audit Office should be a member of the implementation steering \ncommittee to ensure that it is aware of the implementation plan, in particular the transitional \narrangements, and to provide feedback on departmental implementation especially where it \nmay see difficulties of compliance with policy requirements, and where training is needed. \n \n17.  International consultants will be engaged by ADB as individuals in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants.  It is envisaged that one international consultant (lead \nconsultant) with experience in public sector financial management reforms will be recruited, on \nan intermittent basis, for a total of 12 months. Other short-term consultants will be recruited on a \nneeds basis for a total of 7 months: a trainer with public expenditure management knowledge \nand a system accountant with experience in software packages appropriate for public sector \nfinancial applications. The lead consultant will be responsible for the content and scope of \ntraining  materials  in  collaboration  with  a  local  educational  institution.  The  Government  will \nengage  the  local  educational  institution  to  collaborate  on  the  preparation  of  the  training \nmaterials, participate in the initial training, and take over training activities after the completion of ", "    5 \nthe  TA.  The  Government  will  also  engage  a  domestic  consultant  in  accordance  with \narrangements satisfactory to ADB who, with advice from the lead consultant, will develop a \nchange  management  and  communication  strategy  to  ensure  that  all  public  officials  fully \nunderstand the policy and procedural changes that will affect their daily work and to manage \nstakeholders\u2019 expectations of FMR benefits. The terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix 3. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 24 months, from September 2003 to August \n2005. The lead consultant, to be assisted by a local counterpart to be provided by the Ministry of \nFinance  and  Planning,  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  the  work  of  all  members.  The \nconsultants will contribute, as appropriate, to the progress and final reports to be prepared by \nthe lead consultant. Each consultant, however, will prepare his/her final report on specific \nachievements  and  lessons  learned  under  the  TA,  covering  his/her  particular  area  of \nexpertise/responsibility.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of US$460,000 on a grant basis \nto the Government of the Fiji Islands for Strengthening Public Sector Financial Governance, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \nImproved utilization of  Revised Public Finance  Enactment of the new \npublic resources and  and Management Act (new  PFMA \ngovernment  PFMA) to require output/   \naccountability  performance budgeting,   \n  medium-term fiscal  Format of budget papers \nframework, and other  to reflect requirements of \nrecommendations arising  the new PFMA \nout of the legislative   \nreview, and accepted by   \nGovernment   \n \nPurpose       \nImproved consistency of  Cabinet approval of  Minutes of cabinet  Continued political will for \ngovernment policies on  legislative review and  meetings  reforms \npublic sector  recommendations     \nadministrative and       \nfinancial management  Performance contracts for  Content of agencies'   \nreforms  chief executives and  corporate plans and   \n  senior executives of  chief executive service   \n  ministries and statutory  and senior executive   \n  bodies include clauses on  service performance   \n  outputs and performance  contracts   \n  indicators consistent with     \n  agencies' budgets and     \n  corporate plans.     \n       \nEnhanced skills of a core  Identification, training, and  Steering committee\u2019s  Government funding \ncadre of public servants  retention of this core group  quarterly reports   needed for the installation \nto implement the financial  within the public sector    of a new financial \nmanagement reform      management information \nprogram on a sustainable      system (incorporating \nbasis      budget, general ledger, \n      and performance \n      indicator modules) and \n      for training programs will \n      be provided when \n      required. \n     \nEstablishment of a  Simplified and user- Format and content of \nframework for improved  friendly output-based (i.e.,  annual budgets \nbudgeting, accounting,  performance) budgets   \nand financial reporting by     \npublic sector agencies  Budgeting, accounting,  Participants\u2019 feedback \n  and reporting policies and  on training workshops  \n  procedures to implement   \n  the requirements of the   \n  revised PFMA   ", "  Appendix 1  7 \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \n     \n  Regular quarterly financial  Press releases by the \n  accounts published by the  government on financial \n  government  accounts \n     \nTimely annual reports by  Same as above from \ndepartments including  individual ministers \ndiscussion of nonfinancial   \noperational achievements \nand financial compliance \n \nOutputs       \n1.

Scope and Work Program \n1.  The key purpose of the technical assistance (TA) is to provide the public sector financial \nmanagement  expertise  required  to  assist  the  Government  in  the  review  of  the  relevant \nlegislation, in particular the suspended Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) of 1999, to \ninitiate planning for the implementation of the revised PFMA and the transfer of knowledge and \nskills to local counterparts to ensure no long-term reliance on foreign experts. The TA aims to \ninstitutionalize an acceptable level of support in budgeting and financial management (including \nsome knowledge of the selected financial software system) to ensure that staff understand the \npractical requirements of the revised PFMA, the linkages between output/performance-based \nbudgeting and reporting, financial devolution, and managerial accountability. \n2.  The consultants engaged under the TA will undertake on-the-job training of local staff in \nthe requirements of output/performance-based public finance management as applied in the Fiji \nIslands and as incorporated into the new financial management information system (FMIS) that \nwill support the budgeting, accounting, reporting, and performance monitoring activities under \nthe performance-oriented management system. As the implementation of the revised PFMA will \nbe phased over a minimum of 3 years, and given that the Fiji Islands has already introduced a \npartial medium-term expenditure framework and a performance management system for senior \npublic servants, a pilot implementation of output/performance budgeting is not planned at this \nstage.
