INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) to the Government of Mongolia will \nsupport capacity building and skills for detection and surveillance of the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) in Mongolia. The TA will achieve this through capacity development training and \ninformation dissemination. The proposed TA activities will be coordinated across government \nagencies.1  \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) country partnership strategy \nfor Mongolia, 2017\u201320202 and ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priorities to enhance human \ncapital, provide better health for all, and strengthen governance and institutional capacity.3 The \nTA is also aligned with the Mongolia State Policy on Health 2017\u20132026,4 which reaffirms \nsustained commitment to improving health services and outcomes. The TA is an emergency \nresponse to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Mongolia\u2019s response to COVID-19. COVID-19 first emerged in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) in December 2019. While the PRC attempted to contain the virus, air travel and \ninterconnectivity during the initial days of the virus\u2019 emergence contributed to its international \nspread. Landlocked and sharing a long southern border with the PRC, Mongolia responded swiftly \nto the rapidly emerging situation and, by mid-January 2020, the government instituted strict \nemergency measures to prevent the virus from spreading. These measures included international \nand national travel restrictions; nonessential business closure; public awareness campaigns; \nrestrictions on public gatherings, meetings, and celebrations; closure of schools; and rapid \npreparation of hospitals to deal with the expected emergency. The swift and rapid action slowed \nthe virus spread and Mongolia has managed to mitigate community transmission. \n \n4.  An  estimated  20%  of  the  population  are  at  \"high  risk\"  to  contract  COVID-19. \nMongolia is considered a high risk country because of severe weather conditions, prevalence of \nrespiratory  diseases  accounting  for  a  high  burden  of  disease,  and  20%  of  the  population \nestimated as high risk because of age and comorbidities. The World Health Organization (WHO) \nevaluation of core capacities in Mongolia indicates that its preparedness to respond to health \nthreats is limited. WHO recommended increased funding and support for public health workforce \ntraining, surveillance and risk assessments, laboratory systems, and public health emergency \npreparedness. Recommendations also included strengthening pandemic influenza preparedness \nplanning; sharing risk assessments across sectors; mapping potential hazards; maintaining \nstockpiles; developing surge capacity during emergencies; improving active and passive disease \nsurveillance of new and emerging diseases; and developing capacity for medical, nursing, and \nallied health staff to surveil and diagnose emerging health threats.5 \n \n1  Other agencies might include the National Emergency Management Agency, the National Center for Communicable \nDiseases, border military services, customs, and immigration services. \n2  ADB. 2017.

Geneva. \n ", "2 \n5.  A number of specialized agencies support national pandemic response efforts. In \naddition to the Ministry of Health, the General Agency for Specialized Inspection (GASI), the \nNational Emergency Management Agency, the National Center for Communicable Diseases, \nborder military services, customs, and immigration services all support the pandemic response \nefforts. As the national inspection agency responsible for all entry points in the country, GASI is \none of the most important agencies engaged in pandemic response efforts. GASI inspectors are \nresponsible for managing and containing infectious diseases at border-crossing points and \nreducing any potential vectors for transmission (i.e., goods and materials) at key land and sea \nports. To date, all of Mongolia\u2019s COVID-19 cases have been imported through borders. GASI has \nbeen critical in managing these threats and instituting measures to shut down the country\u2019s \nconnectivity to mitigate the spread. Other supporting agencies are also highly vulnerable as the \nfirst points of contact for new cases and making them critical for a coordinated and effective \nnational response.  \n \n6.  A gap exists in training and capacity building for COVID-19 surveillance, detection, \nand mitigation. GASI, border military services, customs, and immigration services are not \nspecialized health agencies. However, they play a central role in the country\u2019s response, making \ncoordination and their understanding of infectious disease outbreaks critical to managing and \nmitigating the risks. Yet, no formalized training in effective infectious disease response is available \nfor their staff members. Training in infectious disease control, risk communication, surveillance, \nand prevention for GASI\u2019s and other agencies\u2019 staff members is, therefore, a critical gap that \npositively impacts effective COVID-19 response. Some key gaps in capacity building include \nsurveillance  of  emerging  infectious  diseases,  infection  prevention  and  control,  and  risk \nmanagement. Targeted capacity building activities for key agencies will assist Mongolia to mount \na successful COVID-19 response. \n \n7.  ADB support for COVID-19 response. The Government of Mongolia has requested ADB \nsupport to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. ADB engagement in the health sector has been \nsignificant and impactful. ADB has responded to Mongolia\u2019s immediate need by repurposing \n$1.4 million loan savings to purchase equipment and laboratory diagnostics to detect and screen \nfor COVID-19; reallocating $75,000 to purchase screening equipment at selected border crossing \npoints; providing $1.0 million assistance from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund to procure \nemergency medical equipment; mobilizing a small-scale technical assistance of $225,000 for \nhealth  sector  training  in  emergency  response;  providing  an  emergency  assistance  loan  of  \n$30.0 million to upgrade hospital infection, prevention, and control practices, establish and \nmanage a centralized stockpile of medicines and medical equipment, and improve capacity to \ndiagnose COVID-19; and mobilizing a COVID-19 Rapid Response Program of $100.0 million to \nmitigate the severe economic and health impacts of the pandemic.6 \n \n \n6  Repurposing ($1.4 million) for ADB.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: public health threats effectively addressed \n(footnote 4). The TA will have the following outcome: management and institutional response to \nCOVID-19 and other emerging infectious diseases strengthened.7 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Knowledge and skills in disease surveillance and outbreak response \nimproved. The TA will provide training to key GASI personnel (central and local) and other \nagencies involved in response, such as border military services, customs, and immigration \nservices, in specific areas, including, but not limited to (i) prevention and control of infections;  \n(ii) appropriate use of personal protective equipment; (iii) management of infectious individuals in \na non-discriminatory manner; (iv) management of potentially infectious or hazardous physical \nobjects  during  outbreaks;  (v)  leveraging  of  digital  technology  to  support  better  disease \nsurveillance, especially in border areas; and (vi) development of methods and joint strategies to \nidentify  early  warning  signs  of  COVID-19  and  other  infectious  diseases.  ADB  will  hold \nconsultations  and  capacity  development  workshops,  facilitate  peer-to-peer  learning  through \nknowledge exchange, and strengthen collaboration with technical agencies such as WHO and \nthe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) to deliver trainings.8 National experts will be \nengaged as resource persons to facilitate the trainings. The TA will identify key agency staff \nmembers to undergo \"training of trainers,\" to ensure that institutional memory is maintained and \ntrainers can continue to conduct cascade training even after TA completion. Under this output, a \nbackground report on managing infectious diseases for frontline government agencies will also \nbe produced. \n \n10.  Output 2: Risk communication for COVID-19 supported.9 The TA will support risk \ncommunication and increase public awareness about the pandemic. Support for the design and \nimplementation of a risk communication strategy will include development and production of \nmaterials and dissemination approaches. The TA will (i) produce a digital and print educational \noutreach campaign on COVID-19, (ii) inform the public of ongoing risks and behavioral mitigation \nstrategies, (iii) prepare a dissemination strategy, and (iv) support dissemination of the campaign \nwith GASI.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $400,000, of which $350,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix  2.  The  Government  of  Mongolia  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \n \n7  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n8  This could be explored since ADB has a memorandum of understanding with UNICEF. UNICEF and ADB. 2018. \nMemorandum of Understanding. Bali. \n9  Risk communication refers to the exchange of real-time information and advice between experts and individuals \nfacing threats to their health and socioeconomic well-being. \n ", "4 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB will administer the TA, in close coordination with GASI, the executing agency for the \nTA. The Urban and Social Sectors Division of the East Asia Department will select, supervise, \nand evaluate consultants and organize capacity building activities. \n \n13.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  21 August 2020\u201331 July 2022  \nExecuting agency  General Agency for Specialized Inspection \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual: Individual  Public health expert  $54,500 \nconsultant selection   (national, 9 person-months) \nIndividual: Individual  Project coordinator  $44,600 \nconsultant selection   (national, 12 person-\nmonths) \nIndividual: Resource  Facilitators and resource  $44,000 \nperson selection  persons (national) \nFirm: Consultants'  Communication agency  $60,000 \nqualification selection  (national, 10 person-\nmonths) \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time \nto time).  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: ADB. \n \n14.

ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated procurement staff instructions.10 \nADB  will engage individual consultants, facilitators, and resource persons to organize and \nmanage trainings and workshops under output 1; and engage a national consulting firm to deliver \nactivities under output 2. Considering the highly specialized expertise required, consultants' \nqualification selection will be used to select the firm which will develop a COVID-19 awareness \ncampaign. ADB will evaluate the TA progress through biannual review missions and monitor \nperformance targets and indicators outlined in the design and monitoring framework. \n \n15.  Due diligence. No civil works or environmental safeguards will be triggered during TA \nimplementation. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Mongolia for Strengthening Institutional Capacity to Respond to COVID-19, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.\n \n10 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nPublic health threats effectively addressed (Mongolia State Policy on Health 2017\u20132026)a \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2022     \nManagement and  a.
