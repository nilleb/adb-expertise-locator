INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country program mission to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) in 2013, the government requested ADB assistance in developing a \ncircular economy in Qinghai Province in which materials are recycled, regenerated, and reused \nto minimize the consumption of natural resources.1 The technical assistance (TA) project was \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for the PRC for 2014\u20132016 under a different \nname. This was later revised to better reflect the policy and advisory content and scope of the \nTA.2 The concept paper was approved on 23 October 2014. During a fact-finding mission in \nOctober 2014, an understanding was reached with the government on the impact, outcome, \noutputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  outline  terms  of \nreference. The design and monitoring framework of the TA for Policy Advice on Promoting the \nCircular Economy in Qinghai Province is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.   The PRC\u2019s economy has grown on a yearly average rate of more than 9% since 1982 \nand is now the second largest in the world. Consumption of the country\u2019s natural resources has \nexpanded at an even more rapid pace, and this has caused severe air pollution, water scarcity, \nand  soil  degradation.  The  government  recognizes  that  this  resource-  and  energy-intensive \ndevelopment strategy is not sustainable, as it aims to reduce energy intensity by 16% under its \nTwelfth Five-Year Plan, 2010\u20132015. It has also made the promotion of a circular economy\u2014i.e., \none  that  recycles,  regenerates,  and  reuses  materials  to  minimize  consumption  of  natural \nresources\u2014a major policy objective.  \n \n3.  Qinghai,  located  on  the  Qinghai\u2013Tibet  Plateau  in  the  western  PRC,  is  one  of  the \ncountry\u2019s largest provinces in area but has a population of only 5 million. Only one other \nprovince has a lower gross domestic product. This is despite its importance as a resource base \nand its abundant mineral and natural resources. The provincial economy is heavily dependent \non mineral and natural resource exploitation to produce iron and steel, oil and natural gas, and \nnonferrous and rare earth metals. These industries have damaged the natural environment, \ncausing soil and vegetation degradation, desertification, increased salinization, and a decline in \navailable underground and surface water. Overexploitation of grassland and declining rainfall \nhave  further  exacerbated  the  situation.  Qinghai  is  choosing  to  promote  circular  economic \nactivities as a strategy to mitigate this environment degradation and fundamentally transform \neconomic development in the province.  \n \n4.  The  central  government  instructed  provincial  governments  in  2010  to  promote  the \ncircular  economy  model  in  pilot  zones.  In  response,  the  Qinghai  provincial  government \nestablished 256,000 square kilometer Chaidamu Circular Economy Pilot Zone (CCEPZ), one of \nthe largest of the 33 zones established in the PRC so far. The CCEPZ is well known for its rich \nmineral resources and promotes the integrated development of resource-based industries. This \ninvolves the use of waste products from one industry in the zone by another industry in the zone. \n                                                 \n1  In the PRC, circular economy refers to an economic structure based on the recycling, regenerating, and reuse of \nmaterials. Use of the model is expected to reduce the consumption of natural resources and create a harmonious \nexchange of resources between the economic system and the ecological system. A circular economy can generally \nbe implemented at (i) the small enterprise level; (ii) between enterprises; and (iii) in society at large. Qinghai \nProvince has adopted the development of a circular economy as an important strategy and promotes the circular \neconomy at the societal level.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 October 2014. The original TA \nname was Research on Piloting National Recycle Economy in Qinghai Province.  \n ", "2  \nThe CCEPZ has developed salt lake chemical, petrochemical, coal chemical, and metallurgical \nindustries.  Industries  are  now  emerging  in  the  biotechnology,  renewable  energy,  and  new \nmaterials sectors. By 2013, a total of 495 enterprises in nonferrous metal, coal processing, \nchemical, petrochemical, new material, and renewable energy industries had started operation \nin the pilot zone. They accounted for one-third of the industrial production of the province in \n2013.  \n \n5.  The CCEPZ is helping the province make more efficient use of its natural resource-\nbased industries, since it has allowed the establishment of natural resource enterprises that \nexchange resources.  CCEPZ is also making greater use of such renewable energy sources as \nsolar and wind power. However, energy intensity\u2014total annual energy consumption divided by \ngross domestic product\u2014was 44% higher in the CCEPZ than in other similar zones in 2013. \nThe zone\u2019s remote location in the western PRC makes it a challenge to integrate multiple \nresources  and  relevant  industries.  Problems  such  as  short  industrial  value  chains,  weak \nprocessing capacity, and the high consumption of energy need to be urgently addressed. A \ncomprehensive review of the CCEPZ is required to help develop a new strategy and an action \nplan to develop further resource and energy conservation within pilot zone. This will also help to \ndefine a set of benchmark criteria and indicators for similar pilot zones in Qinghai Province and \nthe rest of the PRC, where experience and lessons learned from a review and new approaches \nsubsequently adopted in the CCEPZ are expected to be used and replicated.  \n \n6.  The successes that have been achieved in the CCEPZ have contributed significantly to \ngovernment efforts to achieve national ecological security in the PRC and to create a well-\nrounded,  moderately  prosperous  society.  However,  the  circular  economy  model  is  a  new \nconcept in Qinghai, and the TA will respond to the need and the government\u2019s request for help \nin developing a comprehensive strategy and action plan to promote it in the province. The TA \nwill  also  offer  opportunities  to  pilot-test  ADB\u2019s  draft  recommendations  for  the  industrial \ntransformation the PRC intends to undertake to promote industry efficiency and technology \ninnovation under its Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 (13th plan).3 \n  \n7.  The TA project aligns well with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS) for the PRC for \n2011\u20132015.4 The CPS calls for ADB to support environmentally sustainable growth, which \nincludes assistance to improve environmental management and energy efficiency and achieve \nsustainable use of land, water, and forest resources. The TA will also provide the support for \nknowledge solutions highlighted in the CPS by helping to develop the strategy and action plan \nfor circular economy pilot zones in Qinghai Province.  \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be scaled-up circular economic development in Qinghai Province. The \noutcome will be the implementation of strategy and action plan to expand the circular economy \nin the province. \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB.

Manila. \n ", "  3\nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will fully assess the lessons learned in the establishment and operation of the \nCCEPZ; develop a strategy and action plan for expanding the circular economy in the province; \nconduct a quantitative assessment of the impact the CCEPZ has had on the local economy \nsince its establishment; formulate a monitoring and evaluation framework for the development of \na  circular  economy  in  Qinghai;  and  provide  policy  recommendations  to  Qinghai  provincial \ngovernment on circular economic development, which are to be reflected in the province\u2019s 13th \nplan for 2016\u20132020. \n \n10.  The TA aims to deliver three outputs to achieve the intended outcome and impact: \n(i)  Output 1: Comprehensive review of Chaidamu Circular Economy Pilot Zone \nconducted  and  strategy  and  action  plan  developed.  The  TA  project  will \nundertake a full analysis of the development process of the CCEPZ and the lessons \nfrom  the  experience  so  far.  The  review  will  identify  the  economic  and  social \nimplications of circular economic development in Qinghai. It will formulate a strategy \nand action plan for circular economic development in the province that will include \ninstitutional arrangements and an incentive framework. \n(ii) Output  2:  Establishment  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  for  circular \neconomy development in Qinghai Province established. The TA project will \nestablish quantifiable indicators for a system to monitor and evaluate progress in \nimplementing  circular  economic  development  in  Qinghai.  It  will  define  the  key \nindicators,  such  as  measures  of  the  industrial  circular  economy  ratio,  resource \nconsumption intensity, and the output rate of resources.  \n(iii) Output  3:  Policy  recommendations  on  promoting  circular  economic \ndevelopment in Qinghai Province proposed. The TA project will provide Qinghai \nprovincial government with recommendations for improving the policy on promoting \ncircular  economic  development  in  Qinghai.  These  are  to  be  reflected  in  the \nprovince\u2019s 13th plan. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $350,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office and housing accommodation, \noffice supplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and other in-kind contributions. \nThe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The Qinghai Provincial Finance Bureau will be the executing agency. It has sufficient \nexperience to undertake this role, having helped implement previous TA projects funded by \nADB.5 The Qinghai Provincial Policy Research Office, which will be the implementing agency, \nhas no prior experience with ADB-funded TA, and the executing agency will provide it with the \nnecessary  assistance  during  project  implementation.

ADB will delegate administration of the TA to the executing agency, in accordance with a \nNovember  2009  memorandum  of  understanding  between  ADB  and  the  government  on \nenhanced partnership on TA delegation to the executing agency. The TA is on the list of the TA \nprojects proposed for delegation by the Ministry of Finance, and both the executing and the \nimplementing agencies participated in training on delegated TA projects in April 2014. An ADB \nassessment confirmed that the implementing agency has the capacity to recruit and supervise \nthe consultants, with the support of the executing agency (Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented over 17 months from 1 February 2015 to 30 June 2016. A \ntotal of 40 person-months of consulting services will be provided, comprising the services of one \ninternational consultant for 3 person-months and services of five national consultants for a total \nof  37  person-months.  The  terms  of  reference  are  in  Appendix  3.  The  consultants  will  be \nselected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time).  A  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  using  the  consultant \nqualification selection procedure. This is because the assignment is specialized and geared \ntoward the expertise of academic institutions. To reduce the administrative burden and improve \nefficiency and value for money, the consulting services under the TA will be engaged on lump \nsum, output-based contracts. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n  \n15.  The consultants will submit the following deliverables to both the executing agency and \nADB: (i) an inception report 2 weeks after commencement of services, (ii) an interim report at an \nappropriate stage during TA implementation, (iii) a draft final report before the conclusion of the \ncontract, and (iv) a final report 2 weeks after receiving comments from the executing agency \nand ADB. All reports must be submitted in English and Chinese.  \n \n16.  The implementing agency will report regularly on major project activities to the executing \nagency. The TA activities will be monitored by the executing agency and ADB review missions. \nThe consultants\u2019 reports will be presented at workshops and seminars organized to validate the \nTA  findings,  and  recommendations.6 Reports  will  be  made  available  on  ADB\u2019s  website  in \nEnglish and Chinese and published in accordance with ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy \n2011. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Policy Advice on Promoting the Circular \nEconomy in Qinghai Province, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n6  An advance payment facility, if appropriate, will be provided to the executing agency for the administration of such \nnational workshops and study tours, honoraria and travel expenses for resource persons in the workshops, \ntranslation and interpretation services, and the printing of documents and reports. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets\nand Indicators with  Data Sources and \nDesignSummary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nCircular economic  By 2020  Provincial  Bureau of  Energy saving and efficient \ndevelopment is scaled up    Statistics  resource use will remain a top \nin Qinghai Province  Proportion of circular    development priority in the \neconomic value addition in  Qinghai yearly books of  PRC and Qinghai Province \nthe province\u2019s industrial  statistics     \nvalue addeda increased to    Risk \n85%.
