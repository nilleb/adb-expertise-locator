THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) with a sovereign guarantee from the Democratic Socialist \nRepublic of Sri Lanka for the Supporting Electricity Supply Reliability Improvement Project.1 The \nreport also describes (i) the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Clean \nEnergy Fund2 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, and (ii) the proposed \nadministration of a grant to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, both to the \nDemocratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka for  the  Supporting  Electricity  Supply  Reliability \nImprovement Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grants for the project. \n \n2.  The  project  includes  (i)  renewable  energy  systems  development\u2014consisting  of \nestablishing hybrid renewable energy systems in small isolated islands, a renewable energy \nmicro-grid system, and support for productive energy use for small isolated island and rural \ncommunities; (ii) reliability improvement of the medium voltage network; (iii) rural electrification \nand distribution performance monitoring improvement; and (iv) reactive power management in \nthe transmission system in the Central, Eastern, Northern, North Central, North Western, Uva, \nSabaragamuwa, Southern, and Western provinces.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Development problem. Sri Lanka has improved its energy sector performance, and \nachieved  a  national  electrification ratio  of 98%  in  2014  compared  with  29%  in  1990. The \nremaining  2%  of  electrification  is  the  most  difficult  to  accomplish,  and  is  mainly  in \nunderdeveloped areas and small isolated islands around the country. Although some provinces \nhave achieved 100% electrification, the former conflict-affected Northern and Eastern provinces \nhave only 92% and 94% electrification; and Uva and North Central provinces achieved 95%, \nwith several districts falling well below this level.4 Improvement of the 33-kilovolt (kV) medium \nvoltage network is needed to ensure system reliability and expand power supply into these rural \nareas, where many poor households remain unconnected and those connected have poor \nquality  of  electricity  supply.  Several  small  isolated  islands  with  a  population  of                        \n1,800\u20134,500 people cannot be provided with electricity through extension of the grid. These \nislands are supplied by expensive electricity generated by inefficient, old diesel generation sets \nthat provide electricity for limited hours during the day, with an electrification ratio of 38%\u201360%. \n \n4.  The  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  aims  to  ensure  sustainable  development  of  energy \nresources by improving the power supply systems to provide access to electricity services to the \nentire population. Sri Lanka has a national investment program, including sector investments \nthat are based on the National Energy Policy and Strategies.5 The National Energy Policy and \nStrategies includes a sector road map, a long-term investment plan, and policy and reform \nmeasures. The country\u2019s installed generation capacity of 3,932 megawatts produces 12,357 \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Financing partners: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for Preparing the                       \nSupporting Electricity Supply Reliability Improvement Project (TA 8952-SRI). \n4  The 2015 electrification rate is 85% in Mannar district, 75% in Kilinochchi district, and 80% in Mulathivu district, all \nin the Northern Province. The 2015 electrification rate in Batticaloa district of the Eastern Province is 89%. \n5  Government of Sri Lanka. 2008. National Energy Policy and Strategies of Sri Lanka. Colombo. ", "2 \ngigawatt-hours of electricity (2014),6 adequately covering current demand. Generation capacity \nis sufficient to expand electricity supply further. The government intends to provide electricity to \nthe population through the grid on the main island and mini-grid systems on small isolated \nislands. The project will contribute to the government\u2019s goal of expanding access to electricity \nand developing clean energy. \n \n5.  Project\u2019s value addition. The project will directly benefit the development of lagging \nareas. It will cover 106 rural electrification schemes7 and 2,372 kilometers (km) of low voltage \nline  extensions.  Innovative  hybrid  mini  grids,  consisting  of  wind\u2013solar  and  efficient  diesel \ngeneration systems coupled with energy storage (lithium-ion batteries), will be implemented in \nthe small isolated islands.8 As a result, the project will help to ensure inclusiveness and access \nto  electricity  by  all  the  population.  The  project  is  expected  to  provide  electricity  to  about \n35,710 rural households,9 including the former conflict-affected Northern and Eastern provinces \nas well as Uva and North Central provinces where the current electrification level is lower than \nin other parts of the country. Improvement of the medium voltage network will enhance the \nquality and reliability of electricity supply to more than 493,000 consumers. The project is \nconsistent with the interim country partnership strategy for Sri Lanka of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB).10 It builds on previous ADB interventions focused on supporting transmission and \ndistribution  investments  to  expand  access  to  clean  and  reliable  electricity,  and  renewable \nenergy development.11 \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact will be increased access to clean, reliable, and affordable power supply \naligned with the National Energy Policy and Strategies of Sri Lanka (footnote 5). The outcome \nwill be enhanced electricity supply, and distribution system efficiency and reliability. \n                                                \n6  Ceylon Electricity Board. 2015. Statistical Digest 2014. Colombo. \n7  A rural electrification scheme consists of a dedicated medium voltage (33 kV) line connected to a distribution \nsubstation and a low voltage distribution network to supply electricity to customers in a specific rural area around \nthe substation. \n8  A pilot hybrid mini-grid system subproject is being implemented on Elevaithivu Island under ADB. 2009. Technical \nAssistance for Effective Deployment of Distributed Small Wind Power Systems in Asian Rural Areas. Manila (TA \n7485-REG). The pilot subproject helps CEB, the implementing agency, to build capacity for implementing similar \ninnovative subprojects under the proposed loan. \n9  In addition, 2,871 rural households will benefit from the implementation of the hybrid mini-grid systems in small \nisolated islands. \n10 ADB. 2015.

Manila  finances  hydropower \ndevelopment, transmission and medium voltage network improvements, and energy efficiency through innovative \ndemand-side management pilot subprojects. Under the project preparatory TA for Preparing the Clean Energy and \nNetwork Efficiency Improvement Project (TA 7837-SRI), ADB supported actual wind measurements and wind \nresource assessment at the proposed 375 megawatt wind park site at Mannar, Northern Province. A system \nstability study and a country renewable energy master plan, along with a master plan and a business model of the \nproposed  wind  parks,  were  prepared  with  the  support  of  the  TA  for  Capacity  Building  for  Clean  Power \nDevelopment (TA 8167-SRI). \n ", "3 \nC.  Outputs \n7.  The project will have the following outputs:12 \n(i)  Renewable energy systems established. This involves (a) establishing hybrid \nrenewable energy systems, consisting of wind, solar, efficient diesel generators, \nand battery storage; (b) support for productive energy use for small isolated \nisland and rural communities on three islands in the Jaffna area of the Northern \nProvince (Analativu, Delft, and Nainativu); and (c) a renewable energy micro-grid \nsystem in the Western Province. \n(ii)  Reliability  of  the  medium  voltage  network  improved.  This  involves \n(a) construction  of  270.5 km  of  33 kV tower  lines,  80.0 km  of  33 kV  aerial \nbundled conductor lines, and 13 of 33 kV gantries; and (b) installation of 175 of \n33 kV load-break switches and 25 of 33 kV auto reclosers.  \n(iii)  Rural  electrification  network  extended  and  distribution  performance \nmonitoring improved. This involves (a) construction of 1,979 km of low voltage \nline extensions; (b) 106 rural electrification schemes, comprising 106 of 100 \nkilovolt-ampere distribution substations, 198 km of dedicated 33 kV lines, and \n393  km  of  low  voltage  lines  to  connect  rural  households  to  the  grid;  and \n(c) installation  of  25,000  programmable  distribution  substation  meters  with  a \nremote meter-reading facility. \n(iv)  Reactive power management in the transmission system improved. This \nincludes  installation  of  (a)  100  megavolt-ampere  reactive  breaker-switched \ncapacitors at the 132 kV bus bar of the existing Pannipitiya grid substation; and \n(b) a +100/\u201350 megavolt-ampere reactive static var compensator at the 220 kV \nbus  bar  of  the  existing  Biyagama  grid  substation  for  voltage  control  during \ndynamic conditions. \n \n8.  The  renewable  energy  interventions  include  an  innovative  renewable  energy-based \nmicro-grid pilot subproject to be financed by the investment grant of $1.8 million equivalent from \nthe Clean Energy Fund (CEF) under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility (CEFPF), \nto be administered by ADB. The micro-grid concept will be implemented for the first time in \nSri Lanka. It will support an innovative approach for optimization of cost-effective operation of \nloads and resources, and for the reduction of burden on the national grid. The pilot subproject\u2019s \nscope  includes  (i)  the  preparation  of  a  feasibility  study  and  detailed  design  of  the  pilot \nsubproject;  (ii)  capacity  building  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  micro-grids  in  the \ndistribution system; and (iii) establishing an alternate current\u2013direct current 300-kilowatt micro-\ngrid  system,  including  solar  photovoltaic  power  generation  and  battery  storage,  with  the \ncapability to supply loads from both alternate current and direct current bus bars. The pilot \nsubproject\u2019s  results  will  contribute  to  the  development  of  interconnection  standards  and \noperation guidelines for the renewable energy micro-grid to facilitate replication in the future. \n \n9.  Additional support for ensuring the sustainability of the hybrid renewable energy systems \nin the small isolated islands will be provided through grant-financed activities for $2 million \nequivalent from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR), to be administered by ADB. This \naims to improve livelihoods in local communities, including women, through (i) training in the \nsafe use of electricity equipment; (ii) training in the productive use of income opportunities \ncreated as a result of access to electricity; (iii) increasing employment in local communities to \nwork  as  a  maintenance  crew  for  simple  and  routine  repairs,  as  well  as  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  hybrid  renewable  energy  systems  and  other  facilities;  and  (iv)  developing \n                                                \n12 Detailed Description of Project Components (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \nadditional infrastructure (i.e., a small seawater desalination plant, small water storage tanks, an \nice-making factory, refrigeration facilities, and public street lighting).13 \n \nD.

The Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy (MPRE) will be the executing agency \nfor  the  two  grant  components.  Lanka  Electricity  Company  Limited  (LECO)  will  be  the \nimplementing agency for the micro-grid pilot subproject, while the Sustainable Energy Authority \n(SEA) and the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) will be the implementing \nagencies for the grant component for improving livelihoods in local communities. For this grant \ncomponent, NWSDB will be responsible for the development of additional infrastructure\u2014a \nwater desalination plant, an ice-making factory, and small water storage tanks. ADB will enter \ninto a grant agreement with Sri Lanka, and a project agreement with LECO, for the CEF under \nthe CEFPF grant; and a grant agreement with Sri Lanka, and a project agreement with SEA and \nNWSDB, for the JFPR grant. A steering committee, chaired by the MPRE secretary, will guide \nCEB, LECO, SEA, and NWSDB; and review progress and results. CEB, LECO, SEA, and \nNWSDB  will  set  up  project  management  units.  The  units  will  oversee  procurement, \ndisbursement,  financial  management  and  accounting,  quality  assurance,  and  social  and \nenvironmental issues; and will coordinate with the procurement committee, appointed by the \ncabinet or MPRE, depending on the contract size. Full-time managers will supervise each \nproject component. \n \n15.  The government and CEB have asked ADB to approve advance contracting for the \nprocurement of goods and civil works, including preparing bidding documents, and inviting and \nreceiving bids for project contracts, and retroactive financing under the project. Retroactive \nfinancing will be allowed for up to 20% of the loan amount for expenditures incurred prior to loan \neffectiveness, but no earlier than 12 months before the signing of the loan agreement. The \ngovernment and CEB were advised that ADB\u2019s approval of advance contracting and retroactive \nfinancing  in  principle  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  any  part  of  the  project.  The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project \nadministration manual (PAM).15 \n                                                \n15 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  1 October 2016\u201330 September 2021 \nEstimated completion date  30 September 2021 \nEstimated loan and grant closing  31 March 2022 \ndate \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Steering committee consisting of the secretary, MPRE (chair), and \nrepresentatives of MOF, MNPEA, MPRE, CEB, LECO, SEA, and \nNWSDB (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  MPRE (for grant-financed components), CEB (for loan-financed \ncomponents) \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  CEB (for loan-financed components); LECO, SEA, and NWSDB (for \ngrant-financed components) \n(iv)  Project management unit  Established in CEB, LECO, SEA, and NWSDB \nProcurement  International  8 procurement  $93.47 million \ncompetitive bidding  packages \n  National competitive  1 procurement  $5.79 million \nbidding  packagea \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost- 44 person-months  $0.70 million \nbased selection  \n \n  Individual  15 person-months  $0.38 million \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advance contracting, including preparation of bidding documents, \nadvance contracting  inviting and receiving bids for contracts, and retroactive financing of \nup to 20% of the loan amount for expenditures incurred prior to loan \neffectiveness, but no earlier than 12 months before the signing of \nthe loan agreement. \nDisbursement   The loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time \nto time) and detailed arrangements agreed between the \ngovernment, CEB, LECO, SEA, NWSDB, and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CEB = Ceylon Electricity Board, LECO = Lanka Electricity Company Limited, \nMOF = Ministry of Finance, MNPEA = Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, MPRE = Ministry of Power \nand Renewable Energy, NWSDB = National Water Supply and Drainage Board, SEA = Sustainable Energy Authority. \na  The procurement package includes concrete poles that are normally manufactured and supplied locally.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \nIII.

The \neconomic  viability  of  the  project  has  been  examined  through  a  cost\u2013benefit  analysis,  by \ncomparing with- and without-project scenarios, conducted using ADB guidelines for economic \nanalysis.17 All project components have been confirmed as least-cost, with sound economic \nrationale for investment. The aggregate economic internal rate of return is estimated at 13.1%, \nabove the assumed hurdle rate of 12.0% and, on this basis, the overall project is economically \nviable. A sensitivity and risk analysis demonstrates adequate economic performance for the \nproject. The renewable energy and rural electrification components have slight sensitivity to a \nvariation in certain project parameters, reflecting an economic internal rate of return below the \nhurdle rate as a result of higher costs for the \u201clast mile\u201d electrification.18 \n \n18.  Financial viability was examined by comparing the incremental costs and benefits on a \nwith- and without-investment basis using ADB guidelines.19 The real weighted average cost of \ncapital was calculated for each component and resulted in 2.6% average costs for the overall \nproject. Financial viability was assessed by comparing the weighted average cost of capital with \nthe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  each  component  and  for  the  overall  project.  The \naggregate financial internal rate of return is 3.2%, which is slightly higher than the weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  of  2.6%,  suggesting  that  the  overall  project  is  marginally  viable. \nSensitivity analysis shows that the estimated financial returns are sensitive to cost overruns or \nimplementation delays that are excluded from the regulated revenue of CEB and LECO.20 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n19.  CEB and LECO are the only two power utilities in the country. SEA is the government \nagency responsible for energy efficiency and renewable energy development, and NWSDB is \nthe government agency responsible for water supply. The government and CEB own most of \nLECO\u2019s shares; municipalities and the Urban Development Authority are minority shareholders. \nAs a distribution company, LECO operates based on a separate license and demonstrates \nprofitability. CEB is a vertically integrated utility comprising six functional business units (FBUs). \nThe Sri Lanka Electricity Act, 2009 encourages efficiency improvements of CEB by regulating \neach  FBU.  The  act  empowers  the  Public  Utilities  Commission  of  Sri  Lanka  (PUCSL),  an \nindependent regulator for energy and water established under the PUCSL Act, 2002, to regulate \nthe  electricity  supply  industry.  PUCSL  began  regulating  each  FBU  separately  and  issued \nindividual licenses in 2009. It established a tariff methodology and a road map for tariff reforms \nand rebalancing in 2011. Financial accounts are segregated to allow each FBU to operate as a \nprofit  center,  and  a  transfer-pricing  scheme  between  FBUs  was  developed.  However,  the \nprocess of the delegation of day-to-day management and financial decision making to FBU \nheads  is  not  complete,  and  the  transfer-pricing  scheme  between  FBUs  is  not  functioning \nproperly.  \n \n20.  LECO, SEA, and NWSDB\u2014which will implement the grant-financed components\u2014have \nthe necessary experience and capacity to undertake activities envisaged under the grants. CEB \n                                                \n17 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18  The \u201clast mile\u201d is defined as the last stage in providing services to consumers that has proved to be expensive.  \n19 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 The energy sector regulator allows utilities to earn annual revenue according to a revenue control formula that \nexcludes cost overruns or implementation delays and is defined in the approved tariff methodology. \n ", "8 \nhas the necessary capacity to undertake the project. It was the implementing agency for past \nADB-financed projects and has managed investments funded by other development partners. \nThe financial management assessment of CEB concludes that it can fulfill ADB\u2019s fiduciary \nrequirements  for  the  project.  CEB  regularly  faces  cash  shortfalls  because  of  low  tariffs, \nexpensive power generation, and expensive short-term loans. These shortcomings need to be \ncorrected. Under the 2009 act, all tariffs must reflect costs and the Treasury will bear the cost of \nany government-approved subsidy. In March 2008, the government introduced a new tariff \nstructure that increased average retail tariffs by 30%. The tariff order issued by PUCSL in \nJanuary 2011 increased the average electricity tariff by about 8%. In February 2012, PUCSL \nimplemented a fuel adjustment formula for certain customer categories. In April 2013, retail \nelectricity tariffs were increased by 35% on average. The government has also converted CEB\u2019s \nlong-term debt into equity. \n \n21.  The financial management capacity of all four implementing agencies is assessed as \nacceptable for the project. In the case of CEB, the overall risk is assessed as moderate and \nseveral risk mitigation measures will be implemented. The overall risk has been assessed as \nlow for LECO, SEA, and NWSDB. Details of the financial management assessments of CEB, \nLECO,  SEA,  and  NWSDB  are  in  the  PAM  and  in  the  assessment  of  CEB\u2019s  financial \nperformance and projections.21 CEB\u2019s financial performance has improved to some extent in \n2014\u20132015. However, its ongoing financial sustainability will depend on the extent to which it is \nallowed to charge its customers fully cost-reflective tariffs to service debt and to undertake a \nprudent capital and operating expenditure program. Based on the government\u2019s request to lend \ndirectly to CEB for the project under the sovereign guarantee, specific financial management \ncovenants are included in the draft legal agreements. \n \n22.  All procurement will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2015, as amended from time to time). Recruitment of consultants will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  An \noversight role by ADB will ensure integrity in procurement and implementation activities. CEB \nmaintains a project website that will be updated regularly and will include (i) bidding procedures, \nbidders, and contract awards; (ii) use of funds disbursed under the project; and (iii) physical \nprogress.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  government,  CEB,  LECO,  SEA,  and  NWSDB.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social   \n \n23.  The project will contribute to sustainable economic development, poverty reduction, and \nsocial well-being through increased access to electricity, and improvement in the reliability and \nquality of power supply. Greater access to a stable supply of electricity will promote business \nexpansion  and  increase  jobs,  which  will  help  reduce  poverty.  Electricity  generated  by  the \nrenewable energy systems will be used to produce drinking water at the seawater desalination \nplant, and ice for fish and food storage at the ice-making factory that will be constructed on \nNainativu island, to address the immediate needs of poor households. The project is expected \nto  generate  jobs  for  skilled  and  unskilled  laborers  during  construction  and  throughout  the \noperation of the established renewable energy systems, water desalination plant, and ice-\nmaking factory in the small islands. Reliability improvement of the 33 kV network will enhance \nthe quality and reliability of the electricity supply to more than 493,000 consumers, and rural \nelectrification extension will provide access to electricity for about 35,710 households in rural \n                                                \n21 The summary of CEB\u2019s historical financial performance and projections is in Financial Analysis (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nareas. Improved access to electricity and better supply quality will also enhance the living \nstandards of rural households. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n24.  Environment. The project investments are classified as category B for environment.22 \nMajor components include the construction of 33 kV tower lines, gantries, and hybrid renewable \ngeneration systems where construction work is limited to building foundations for transmission \ntowers,  gantries,  and  small  renewable  energy  systems.  CEB,  LECO  and  NWSDB  have \nadequate institutional capacity, commitment, and experience to manage environmental risks \nduring the construction and operation of project facilities. Potential environmental impacts are \nmostly temporary, predictable, reversible, and can be mitigated; and sensitive ecosystems will \nnot be impacted. Environmental management plan mitigation measures will be incorporated into \ncivil works contracts, giving contractors the primary responsibility for implementation during \nconstruction.  CEB,  LECO,  and  NWSDB  will  supervise  construction  and  environmental \nmanagement plan implementation. The contractors, CEB, LECO, and NWSDB will adhere to \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and national environmental regulations. \n \n25.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement.23 No physical displacement is envisaged. Some 0.600 hectares (ha) of private \nland will be acquired (0.10% of the total 546.24 ha of land required) and 0.038 ha of land will be \nlost to tower footing (0.06% of the total land required). Twelve households will be affected by the \nland acquisition and about 480 households will be affected by the right-of-way, but none will \nlose 10% or more of productive assets. The project\u2019s social impacts have been adequately \nassessed. Where new gantries are built on commercial and private land, compensation will be \npaid to the owners at replacement cost. Distribution transformers will be mainly mounted on \npoles. Transmission and distribution lines primarily cross public and unused lands. Construction \nwill be carried out during non-cropping seasons. Where cropland is affected, compensation at \nreplacement cost will be paid. Budgetary provisions are in place to compensate affected people \nin a timely manner for these losses if and when they occur. A resettlement plan has been \nprepared that is adequate to address the assessed risk. CEB has implemented several ADB \nprojects and is capable of conducting resettlement in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement. Special attention will be paid to addressing gender equity issues in the resettlement \nplan. Additional assistance will be given to vulnerable households, including those headed by \nwomen. Social surveys and consultations were undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. The loan agreement will include a standard assurance related to core labor \nstandards for contractors, including equal pay for equal types of work, and an awareness \nprogram on HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. The project is classified as category C \nfor indigenous peoples, as no indigenous peoples will be affected.  \n \n26.  Climate change impact. The project\u2019s renewable energy interventions will bring an \nadditional 2.16 gigawatt-hours of wind and solar power generation to the electricity supply \nsystem per year and result in avoiding about 2,697 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year \nfor the useful life of the plants. The new medium voltage lines constructed to improve reliability \nof electricity supply in rural areas will help to avoid generation of 19 gigawatt-hours per year, \nequivalent  to  preventing  6,900  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  emissions  per  year,  adjusted  for \nemissions of additional electricity consumption by new customers. The climate change risk \nscreening confirms that the project components have moderate climate change risks.24 \n                                                \n22 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Project Climate Risk Assessment and Management Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "10 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n27.  Governance  risk  stems  from  CEB  having  insufficient  cash  to  fund  its  operations \n(para. 20).  Risks  to  project  implementation  include  delays  in  generation  and  transmission \ninvestments that may impact improvements in electricity supply and reliability of the distribution \nnetwork, and cost escalation. These risks appear to be moderate and may be mitigated by \n(i) ensuring progress on power sector reforms, government efforts to increase supply capacity \nand reduce generation costs, and improving CEB\u2019s corporate financial management; (ii) timely \nimplementation of CEB\u2019s long-term generation and transmission investment plans; and (iii) \nclosely  supervising  implementation  and  advance  contracting.  The  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the mitigation costs.

ASSURANCES \n \n28.  The government and CEB have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and CEB have agreed with ADB on certain  \ncovenants  (including  operational  and  corporate  financial  management  covenants)  for  the \nproject, which are set forth in the legal agreements. \n \nV.
