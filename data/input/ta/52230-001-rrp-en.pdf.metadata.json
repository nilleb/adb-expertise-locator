THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npolicy-based loan (PBL), and (ii) a proposed project loan, both to the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) for the Xiangtan Low-Carbon Transformation Sector Development Program (XSDP). \n \n2.  The XSDP will enhance the ongoing efforts of the Xiangtan Municipal Government (XMG) \nto transform Xiangtan from a carbon-intensive, heavily polluting city to a low-carbon, resilient, \nsmart, and livable city, while pursuing continuous growth. The project loan will demonstrate \ninfrastructure transformation through the integration of transport, building, energy, and climate-\nresilience  solutions,  complemented  by  information  and  knowledge  systems.  The  PBL  will \nreinforce the project through reforms and promote low-carbon behavior changes by creating an \nenabling environment with appropriate incentives. The XSDP is the first sector development \nprogram in the PRC with integrated and multisector solutions.1 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Economic performance of the People\u2019s Republic of China and its commitment to \nclimate change. Since the PRC\u2019s economic reforms began in 1978, its gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth has averaged almost 10% a year, and more than 850 million people have been \nlifted out of poverty. Income inequality has improved but the PRC lags in labor productivity and \nhuman capital.2 Its high growth is based on energy- and resource-intensive manufacturing. Rapid \ngrowth has exceeded the pace of institutional development, which has led to economic, social, \nand environmental imbalances. The PRC is the world\u2019s largest emitter of greenhouse gases \n(GHG), so its engagement with climate change issues is necessary. The PRC is a signatory to \nthe Paris Agreement, which was adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United \nNations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change. As such, the PRC is committed to its \nnationally determined contribution, with the ambitious target to peak carbon emissions by 2030. \nWitnessing rapid urbanization and recognizing the strategic role that cities can play in GHG \nreduction, the PRC implemented its Low-Carbon Cities Initiative (LCCI). The LCCI encourages \ncities  to  create  new  development  models  for  inclusive,  environmentally  sustainable,  and \nprosperous cities, and to share their learning. \n \n4.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) assessment indicated that real GDP contracted by \n6.8% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019 due to the coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) pandemic.3 The IMF predicted that domestic activity will recover from March \n2020 onward, projecting real GDP to grow at 1.2% in 2020 and at 9.2% in 2021 (footnote 3), while \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) predicted the GDP growth at 1.8% in 2020 and 7.4% in 2021.4 \n \n5.  Xiangtan\u2019s commitment to low-carbon development. Xiangtan is an old industrial city \nundergoing rapid urbanization and industrial transformation. It is located 40 kilometers (km) south \nof Hunan\u2019s capital, Changsha, and had a population of about 3 million and an urbanization rate \nof 62% in 2019. Situated within the Changsha\u2013Zhuzhou\u2013Xiangtan (CZT) city cluster, Xiangtan \nwith least population among them has been a key economic driver for Hunan province. Its growth \n \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Detailed economic performance of the PRC is provided in the Fiscal and Debt Management Assessment (accessible \nfrom the list of supplementary documents in Appendix 2). \n3  IMF Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). This letter refers to the PRC \nassessment letter for the Asian Development Bank, issued on 1 May 2020. \n4  ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook Supplement (June2020). Manila. \n ", "2 \nhas also led to GHG emissions increasing by 4.5% per year during 2005\u20132016, reaching 39.69 \nmillion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO e). Xiangtan has a higher GHG intensity \n2\nper unit of GDP than the average for Hunan province or the PRC. In 2018 Xiangtan became a \nlow-carbon city under the LCCI and is committed to achieving carbon peaking by 2028 to localize \nthe PRC\u2019s nationally determined contribution target. The XMG\u2019s measures to reduce carbon \nemissions have included allocation of financial support for industrial transformation, promotion of \nlow-carbon technologies, deployment of clean vehicles, expansion of a public bicycle program, \nrestoration of wetland and forests, and expansion of green areas.5 However, much more effort \nneeds to be done to substantially reduce GHG in a very limited time frame without impacting \neconomic growth. \n \n6.  Xiangtan\u2019s development challenges. In 2016, GHG emissions in Xiangtan were from \nthe following sources: industry (52%), energy processing (18%), building (12%), agriculture \n(10%), transport (8%), waste (1%), and carbon sink from land-use change and forestry (1%).6  \nAs part of its industrial transformation support by policy, the XMG has closed down heavily \npolluting industrial plants and taken measures to attract high-tech, information and communication \ntechnology (ICT), and research and development-oriented industries. Energy and resource-\nintensive industries remain as the critical economic drivers, but knowledge and technology-based \nindustries are expected to grow. Coal contributes to 96% of the energy source supplied to the grid \nfrom Xiangtan.7 Solar and wind energy resources are limited in Xiangtan, but other alternative \nenergy sources, particularly industrial waste heat, show great potential to transition to a low-\ncarbon urban energy system. Emissions from the energy used in buildings grew by 330% during \n2005\u20132016, reflecting Xiangtan\u2019s rapid urbanization. As the total floor area of urban buildings is \nexpected to grow further, substantial GHG emissions growth is expected if  green building \ninterventions are not in place. Emissions from transport increased by 400% from 2005 to 2016 \nand passenger car ownership increased by 467% during 2008\u20132018. The urban road network in \nXiangtan grew by 43% in 3 years to 500 km, and further expansion is planned. The use of public \ntransport in Xiangtan is low, and without transforming mobility patterns, transport emissions from \ngrowing number of private cars will continue to grow rapidly. Xiangtan has worked closely with \nChangsha and Zhuzhou for better cluster city planning while controlling urban sprawl.8 Xiangtan \nexperiences annual flood events that cause significant economic losses and distress.9 Recovery, \nreconstruction,  and  rehabilitation  of  infrastructure  and  systems  damaged  by  floods  require \nsubstantial  resources  and  energy,  resulting  in  additional  GHG  emissions.  Improved  flood \nresilience of the city will avoid such GHG increases. The XMG initiated sponge city works but \nneeds better knowledge and capacity to integrate more progressive resilience measures into its \ncity development plan.  \n \n7.  Asian Development Bank engagements and lessons. ADB has provided support on \nlow-carbon city development in the PRC through technical assistance (TA), knowledge-sharing \nevents, and publications. ADB provided TA to Xiangtan during 2015\u20132017 and initiated GHG \ninventory development, prepared a city profile covering sector performance and vulnerability to \n \n5  Public expenditure on initial low-carbon works was CNY951.6 million ($135 million) during 2017\u20132019. \n6  XMG. 2017. Xiangtan 2016 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory Report. (internal). \n7 The Central China Grid Co. Ltd. run by the State Grid Corporation of China covering Chongqing, Hunan, Hubei, \nHenan, Jiangxi, and Sichuan provinces is fed by 55% coal, 42% hydro, and 3% wind and solar energy. Xiangtan\u2019s \nenergy supply to the grid is mainly coal, while others supply more renewable energy to the grid. \n8  Xiangtan created \u201cgreen hearts\u201d with reforestation to control city expansion using the compact city development \nprinciple; this increased the carbon sink capacity from zero in 2005 to 465 tCO2e in 2016. \n9  During 2011\u20132017, the total direct economic loss was CNY17 billion ($2.4 billion). These floods affected almost 2.4 \nmillion people, including 143,791 who needed relocation. \n ", "3 \nclimate change, and provided in-depth assessment and recommendations.10 Two follow-up TA \nprojects emphasized the critical roles of local experts and the Hunan Provincial Government \n(HPG).11 Through extensive dialogues and discussions over two years, ADB carried out effective \nknowledge  transfer  and  supported  the  XMG  to  design  and  own  its  unique  low-carbon \ndevelopment model. The program incorporates lessons from the ADB-financed TA and loan \nprojects in Xiangtan and the PRC, such as (i) ADB\u2019s knowledge transfer should be continued to \nempower  a  local  government  and  stakeholders  for  better  planning  and  development  of \ntransformative  measures;  (ii)  integrated  solutions  that  are  cost-effective  and  have  multiple \nbenefits should be strengthened to make visible impacts in GHG emission reductions and also \nmake a city livable; (ii) the wider use of smart technologies should be pursued as they can improve \nthe operational efficiency and generate knowledge for continuous improvement; (iii) climate \nadaptation measures are equally important to avoid or lessen the impacts of flooding and \nassociated losses; (iv) infrastructure provision alone would not incentivize the change of low-\ncarbon behaviors and practice and secure the long-term low-carbon transformation.  \n \n8.  Choice of modality. The XMG chose a sector development program modality because \nthe investment project will not be sustainable without having relevant reforms in place. The PBL \nis necessary to create low-carbon norms, reduce sector incoherency, and institutionalize new \nways of doing low-carbon business. As well-designed physical infrastructure can make low-\ncarbon actions easy, and information and knowledge can expand low-carbon know-how, the \nproject loan will demonstrate integrated and multisector solutions to transform infrastructure and \ninstall ICT and knowledge platforms. The PBL will reinforce the project and ensure the replication \nand continuity of low-carbon transformations. \n \n9.  The XSDP is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.12 It is directly linked to the following \noperational priorities: (i) accelerating progress in gender equality; (ii) tackling climate change, \nbuilding climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; (iii) making \ncities more livable; and (iv) strengthening governance and institutional capacity. The XSDP also \nfollows the Strategy 2030 approaches promoting integrated solutions, multisector approaches, \ndigital development and technologies, private sector participation, and innovative features for \nvalue addition. By combining all these approaches, the SDP exercises a differentiated approach \nto the PRC. The XSDP is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u2013\n2020 and the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 to support more inclusive and \nenvironmentally sustainable growth.13 \n \n10.  The COVID-19 had significantly restrained economic activities in Xiangtan and led to the \nsudden decrease in GHG emissions. With the lowering of COVID-19 related risks, economic \nactivities have been slowly resumed in Xiangtan and carbon emissions are increasing again.  \nBy  demonstrating  transformative  integrated  and  interlinked  solutions  across  physical \ninfrastructure and knowledge-based system provision, the XSDP will create a new green and low-\ncarbon growth model that is resilient to future shocks, while making the city more livable.   \n \n10  ADB. 2015.

The XSDP is aligned with the following impact: Xiangtan\u2019s target of carbon emission \npeaking by 2028 achieved. The XSDP will have the following outcome: use of low-carbon enabling \nsystems in Xiangtan increased. The XSDP will have four outputs based on Xiangtan\u2019s GHG \nprofile, trends, structural challenges, and opportunities for effective carbon reduction. The project \nloan will support outputs 1, 2, and 3 and the PBL will support output 4. \n \n12.  Output 1: Low-carbon and resilient infrastructure transformation demonstrated. \nThrough the project, the XMG will transform the transport system from car-centered infrastructure \nto  people-centered  mobility  systems,  enhancing  safety,14  inclusiveness,15  and  resilience.  \nThe XMG will transform more than 60 km of urban roads by installing medians and peak-hour \ncurbside bus priority lanes; upgrading bus stops using safe, inclusive design; and providing digital \nbus information integrated with improved walking and cycling facilities for seamless access across \nmodes. The transformation of streets through layout changes, improved facilities, and ecosystem-\nbased adaptation (EBA) measures installed will demonstrate how streets can function as both \nflood-mitigating measures and enjoyable urban living spaces.16 The XMG will modify the access \nlayout at two railway stations using enhanced, user-friendly, and inclusive design to facilitate \ntransitions between public low-carbon mobility modes. The school zone transformation at five \nprimary schools will raise road safety awareness while exceeding the requirements for the highest \nsafety rating for walking and cycling under the International Road Assessment Programme (iRAP) \nStar Rating for Schools.17 The XMG will deploy clean energy buses equipped with inclusive and \ngender-sensitive features, and expand electric vehicle charging infrastructure. \n \n13.  The XMG will demonstrate building transformation integrated with advanced technologies \nand resilience measures. First, the XMG will construct a new hospital with integrated solutions of \npassive building design; water-saving features; distributed energy systems to generate power, \nheating, and cooling; and intelligent building energy (and utility) management systems (BEMS). \nAs it is located in a flood-prone zone, the new hospital will be equipped with extensive EBA \nmeasures for flood resilience, resulting in enhanced resilience capacity compared to the PRC \nsponge city technical standards.18 Second, the XMG will retrofit an unused government building \nto house the Asia Low-Carbon Training Center, showcasing green and low-carbon building \ntechniques. With support from the HPG and the LCCI, the XMG will run the Asia Low-Carbon \nTraining  Center to share  its  experience  on  low-carbon  transformations  and  to  support  the \nreplication of their low-carbon models of Xiangtan in other cities in the PRC and in other \ndeveloping countries in Asia and the Pacific that share similar challenges.19 Both buildings (i.e., \nthe hospital and the Asia Low-Carbon Training Center) will obtain Excellence in Design for \n \n14 Road safety, particularly for pedestrians and cyclists, is a critical factor in promoting low-carbon transportation. \n15 Inclusive design features include tactile paving on sidewalks and at bus stops; designated spaces and seats at bus \nstops; buses that can accommodate wheelchairs, prams, pregnant women, the elderly, and children; and wide curb \nramps and elevated crossings for seamless access for all residents. \n16 EBA with green and blue assets is an effective measure for flood control, drought mitigation, heat stress reduction, \nand carbon sink, with co-benefits like aesthetic quality, recreational capacity, better air quality, and health benefits. \n17 Safety features include elevated crossings, curb extensions, extensive signs, and road markings for speed and \npedestrian crossings. The iRAP provides tools to assess road safety and support safer road infrastructure for casualty \nreduction. iRAP. \n18 The 2014 sponge city construction technical guide in the PRC describes the volume capture ratio of annual rainfall \n(VCRa) to quantify a minimum storage volume for drought. The VCRa is set as per the land use and ecological \ndamage sensitivity of a region. As Xiangtan has a VCRa of 75%\u201385%, the hospital was initially designed to have \n740 cubic meters of water detention capacity, but the capacity has since been increased to 6,000 cubic meters. \n19 The program team is preparing a publication titled Xiangtan Climate Actions and Low-Carbon Transformation to \nsupport knowledge sharing. \n ", "5 \nGreater Efficiencies (EDGE) certification developed by the International Finance Corporation \n(IFC), achieving more than 20% savings each in energy, the energy embedded in the buildings\u2019 \ndesign and materials, and water compared to the relevant PRC standards.20 Under this output, \nthe XMG will transform 20 aging urban communities into livable low-carbon exemplars.21 \n \n14.  Output 2: Information and knowledge platforms for informed decision-making and \nbehavioral changes enabled. The XMG will develop integrated urban catchment management \nplans and design for three identified flood-prone zones, which will enhance the XMG\u2019s climate \nresilient city planning knowledge and development.22 Also, the XMG will install, upgrade, and/or \nreprogram  several  sector  ICT  platforms  to  complement  output  1  and  provide  information \nnecessary  for  better  decision-making  and  actions.  Actions  under  output  2  will  include  the \nfollowing: \n(i)  The intelligent transport system will be reprogrammed to switch its main purpose \nfrom easing car congestion to enhancing pedestrians\u2019 road safety and prioritizing \nmass transportation over private vehicles.23 \n(ii)  A smart bus information platform will be installed for better operations and improved \npredictability for users. \n(iii)  A BEMS connecting 200 public buildings will be installed for operational efficiency \nand building energy data management. \n(iv)  A community-scale multi-energy and utility management system will be installed \nconnecting more than 1,300 companies in an industrial zone to optimize operational \nefficiency and drive a culture of collaboration among companies within the zone.  \n(v)  An intelligent early flood warning system will be built for quick data processing and \nrapid forecasting to achieve early and improved flood response management. \n(vi)  A comprehensive environmental monitoring and assessment system (EMAS) will be \ninstalled  with  automated  monitoring  and  intelligent  data  processing  and \nmanagement to support science-based decision-making.  \n(vii)  All these will be consolidated into an open and scalable citywide ICT platform that \ncan continuously expand with new functionalities.  \n \n15.  Output 3: Capacity building and program management enhanced. The XMG will \nengage a program management consultant (PMC) firm consisting of highly experienced sector, \nsafeguards, and project management consultants to improve the XMG\u2019s technical expertise.  \nThe PMC firm will (i) support the XMG with the successful implementation of the XSDP, and  \n \n20 EDGE certification and its online platform are designed to determine the most cost-effective options for green \nbuildings. EDGE makes it easy to quantify savings, while the PRC\u2019s green building labeling system (using points) \ncannot do so in a straightforward manner. EDGE ensures more than 20% savings in each of the three areas of \nenergy, water, and materials savings compared to the relevant PRC standards. The PRC\u2019s 3-star (highest) green \nbuilding label cannot guarantee 20% savings in all three areas. Compared to the PRC building energy efficiency \nstandards, the new hospital has 26% energy savings and the retrofitted government building will have 23% energy \nsavings. Two EDGE-certified building cases will be shared globally through  the EDGE and Green Building \nCertification Inc. websites. EDGE; and Green Business Certification Inc. \n21 Low-carbon and resilient features include building insulation, rooftop solar systems for hot water, light-emitting diode \nlighting, e-bicycle sharing, EBAs at parking lots, drainage improvement, improved streets for safer walking and \ncycling, and installation of natural gas for cooking. \n22 Three identified flood-prone zones are: (i) Railway station block, (ii) Yaowan Park, and (iii) Yangmeizhou Island. \n23 The reprogramming, which does not require additional components or cost increases, will include the following \nfeatures: pedestrian crossing lights will always be turned on, and self-optimized traffic lights will give green wave \n(priority) signals to buses. \n ", "6 \n(ii) implement a range of capacity building activities so the XMG can sustain its low-carbon \ntransformations and successfully manage the Asia Low-Carbon Training Center in Xiangtan.24 \n \n16.  Output 4: Low-carbon transformation policy reforms adopted. Policy actions under \ntranche 1 and tranche 2 of the PBL are grouped into the following reform areas: (i) low-carbon, \nresilient, and smart city development strategy and policies issued; (ii) low-carbon mobility systems \nenhanced; and (iii) low-carbon energy and building systems enhanced. Tranche 1 has 11 policy \nactions and tranche 2 has 9 policy actions, which will reinforce outputs 1 and 2 and drive low-\ncarbon innovations and system transformation. Under the first reform area, the Xiangtan low-\ncarbon development plan, 2018\u20132030 (policy action 1) has set a clear vision and target for the \nXMG\u2019s low-carbon development. The plan provides clear directions on sector relevance and \npriority areas, bind the responsibilities of all the XMG bureaus to plan and implement relevant \nlow-carbon works, institutionalize an integrated and holistic approach, and support cross-sector \ncollaboration and cooperation. Policy actions on sponge city-promoting EBA measures will \nadvance city resilience beyond the national sponge city standards (footnote 18). The policy action \non smart city development will highlight the integrated approach and cross-sector consolidation \nfor efficient use of public investment. Green procurement policy (GPP) actions, adopted for the \nfirst time in the PRC, will lower GHG emissions in the public sector; generate environmental, \nhealth, and economic co-benefits; and develop the market for green products and service \ninnovations.25 Under the second and third reform areas, sector policies will create the right \nincentives,  financing  models,  and  other  enabling  mechanisms  to  mobilize  private  sector \ninvestments and activate wide participation from all economic actors, including the public. Policy \nactions under tranche 1 focus on the XMG\u2019s policies, which include sector-specific plans.26 Policy \nactions under tranche 2 will include management rules for operational reforms, regulations for \ndeveloping  better  incentive  mechanisms,  technical  standards  to  promote  low-carbon \ntechnologies, and design guides to improve urban infrastructure that supports low-carbon actions \nand practices of people, and an improved resilience capacity. By August 2020, all the policy \nactions under tranche 1 have been completed.  \n  \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n17.  Through early involvement at the concept stage, ADB helped the XMG to define low-\ncarbon  development,  highlighting  \u2018system  thinking\u2019  with  holistic  and  integrated  approaches \ncorrecting the siloed development of each sector.27 ADB assisted the XMG in redesigning the \nproject and selecting an effective loan modality considering the XMG\u2019s challenges and ambitious \ncarbon peaking target. ADB supported the XMG (i) in developing appropriate and well-articulated \nincentive  mechanisms  to  activate  all  stakeholders  for  low-carbon  decisions  and  behavior \nchanges; and (ii) in creating effective policies (a) to mobilize domestic financing and private sector \ninvestment in low-carbon businesses, and (b) to stimulate the market for low-carbon products and \n \n24 Capacity building activities include trainings on integrated city planning, compact and transit-oriented development \nplanning, bus priority and traffic light system integration and operation, EDGE tools, district energy systems, \noperation of a range of ICT platforms, GHG inventory and calculation, procurement, financial management, and \nsafeguards. \n25 GPPs institutionalize the process of public authorities in procuring goods, services, and works that lower GHG \nemissions and other negative environmental impacts when compared to goods, services, and works with the same \nprimary functions that would otherwise be procured. \n26 These sector-specific plans describe mandates and institutional reforms at the bureau and provide rationale to secure \nappropriate budget and human resources for the relevant works. \n27 Low-carbon development refers to sustainable development grounded in systems thinking and guided by quantifiable \nindicators of GHG emissions. This type of development encourages integrated city planning, collaborative and \ncoherent sector development, resilience improvement by taking a preventive approach, and active governance \nthrough engaging and activating all stakeholders by providing the right incentives. \n ", "7 \ninnovations through TA.28 ADB engaged (i) an iRAP assessor to evaluate the road safety in five \nschool zones and to recommend safety features; (ii) green building and energy experts to \nredesign two buildings to secure EDGE certification; and (iii) climate adaptation experts to develop \nthe Xiangtan Climate Resilient City Toolbox (XCRCT), a customized touch-table and web-based \nplatform. Using the XCRCT, ADB facilitated collaborative planning among the XMG\u2019s bureaus \nand the consensus-based selection of EBA measures for the project. ADB engaged GPP experts \nto support the XMG with GPP training and policy drafting, which led to the XMG\u2019s commitment to \nadopt GPP. \n \n18.  Development partner coordination and collaboration. The XSDP benefits from past \nand ongoing coordination and collaboration with development partners and other organizations, \nincluding  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW,  ICLEI  \u2013  Local  Governments  for \nSustainability, IFC, the United Nations (UN), and the World Bank.29 IFC provided several rounds \nof training on EDGE, which led to the XMG\u2019s commitment to achieving EDGE certification for new \nand retrofitted buildings under the project loan. Through coordination with the UN and ICLEI \u2013 \nLocal Governments for Sustainability, the XMG and the HPG received GPP training.30 ADB \ncarried out additional due diligence on the XMG\u2019s fiscal management sustainability with support \nfrom the HPG and the World Bank. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs, Investment Cost Estimates, and Financing Plan  \n \n19.  The XSDP is estimated to cost $395.88 million (Table 1), of which ADB will provide \n$150.00 million for the project and $50.00 million for the PBL. \n \nTable 1: Summary Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total  Share of \nSource  ($ million)  (%)  Project (%) \nAsian Development Bank       \nOrdinary capital resources (policy-based loan)  50.00  12.63   \nOrdinary capital resources (project loan)  150.00  37.89  43.37 \nGovernmenta  195.88  49.48  56.63 \nTotal  395.88  100.00  100.00 \na Government counterpart funding applies only to the project loan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n20.

The PBL will be \navailable to the XMG through onlending from the Government of the PRC to the HPG, then to the \nXMG under the same terms as the original loan. The PBL will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace period of 3 years, an annual interest rate determined by ADB\u2019s London Interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The PBL with $25 million each will be \nreleased in two tranches upon full compliance with the tranche release conditions. \n \n \n28 ADB. 2017.

This \nproject includes the support for the XSDP. \n29 ADB and German development cooperation through KfW explored the possibility of providing cofinancing and carried \nout several joint missions to Xiangtan. However, the XMG could not accept German development cooperation \nthrough KfW cofinancing to ensure debt sustainability issue. \n30 GPP is promoted through the UN\u2019s 10 Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production \nPatterns, whose working group supported Binhai New District in Tianjin and Guangming District in Shenzhen in the \nPRC to do pilot procurement on a few selected green products. These districts have not officially adopted GPP. \n ", "8 \n21.  To achieve the successful demonstration of Xiangtan\u2019s low-carbon development model, \npolicy  reforms  are  equally  important  as  infrastructure  investment.  Under  the  PRC\u2019s  highly \nregulated public finance framework, the public finance budget of a local government is funded \nmostly by local taxes and fees, and its deficit is covered by the central government\u2019s tax rebates \nand transfers. Infrastructure investment under the government fund budget can be funded by land \nuse revenues, bonds, and foreign loans. Expenditure for additional reforms like the XMG\u2019s low-\ncarbon development policy reforms becomes a financing gap.31 In 2020, the XMG\u2019s financing \nneeds are estimated to be CNY10.5 billion, of which 55% is derived from the consolidated fiscal \ndeficit and 45% results from the amortization payments of maturing liabilities. The PBL component \nreflects the XMG\u2019s overall financing needs, the strength of the policy reform package, and net \neconomic benefits of the government reform agenda. For 2020, the government\u2019s total gross \nborrowing requirement is estimated at CNY5.5 billion ($780.0 million). To meet the financing \ndemand, the government plans to raise about CNY5.1 billion ($730.0 million) from the issuance \nof securities, and about CNY352.0 million ($50.0 million) from official foreign loans. The IMF was \nconsulted on the program and the IMF letter was obtained (footnote 3). \n \n22.  Project investment plan. The government has requested a regular loan of $150.00 \nmillion from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, which will be available to the XMG through \nonlending from the Government of the PRC to the HPG, then to the XMG under the same terms \nas the original loan to finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a 5-year \ngrace period, an annual interest rate determined by ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. ADB will finance civil works, goods, and consulting services, including capacity \nbuilding and program management expenditures. The XMG will finance civil works, goods, and \ntaxes and duties amounting to $195.88 million. Climate financing is estimated at $175.91 million, \nof which ADB will finance $95.91 million. \n \nTable 2: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.  Base Costb   \n  1.

The XMG is the executing and implementing agency. The XMG established a program \nmanagement office (PMO), which is led by the secretary-general of the XMG and comprising \nrepresentatives from relevant bureaus. The HPG, a strong advocate of low-carbon development, \nis closely involved and has provided guidance, advice, and support to the XMG from the concept \nstage, which it will continue to provide as it helps oversee the progress during implementation. \nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the \nproject administration manual (PAM).32 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  PBL: March 2019\u2013August 2022  \nProject loan: December 2020\u2013December 2025 \nEstimated completion date  PBL: 31 August 2022 \nProject loan: 20 December 2025 \nEstimated loan closing date  PBL: 31 August 2022 \nProject loan: 20 June 2026 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Hunan Provincial Government through Hunan Development and Reform \nCommission and Hunan Department of Finance \n(ii)  Executing and  XMG \nimplementing agency \n(iii) Program  Secretary-general  of  the  XMG,  representatives  from  the  Hunan \nmanagement office   Development and Reform Commission and other municipal bureaus \nProcurement  OCB (internationally advertised)  5 contracts  $28.65 million \nOCB (nationally advertised)   14 contracts  $233.12 million  \n  Government procurement  6 contracts  $9.39 million \nConsulting servicesa  Quality- and cost-based selection  6 contracts  $32.04 million  \nAdvance contracting and  Advance contracting will include five consulting service packages. \nRetroactive financingb   Retroactive financing will apply for up to 20% of the loan amount for \nexpenditures incurred prior to loan effectiveness, but not earlier than 12 \nmonths prior to the signing of the loan agreement.  \nDisbursement   The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n24.  The  XSDP  builds  on  the  technical  assessment  of  the  infrastructure,  systems,  and \nknowledge on climate actions accumulated through several ADB TA projects (footnotes 10 and 11). \nIt incorporates proven and mature low-carbon technology measures that are compatible and \nsuitable for the local conditions, in addition to people-oriented infrastructure design. A flexible \ndistrict energy system at the EDGE-certified hospital is considered the best technical and most \nfinancially viable option to ensure sustainable operations regardless of power outages. The EBA \nmeasures that are extensively incorporated in the project streets and in the hospital have sufficient \nwater retention and detention capacity and generate environmental co-benefits. The open and \nflexible architecture of the Smart City ICT Platform, which can consolidate all sector-based ICT \nplatforms and add new functionality, is a resource-efficient and technically viable solution for \nsmart city development. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n25.  Economic analysis. To conduct the economic analysis, the economic benefits arising \nfrom the project were grouped into four categories: urban transport, flood prevention, energy \nsavings, and the hospital. The PBL is intended to have a range of effects covering all aspects of \nthe project loan and beyond. The project team did not conduct a separate economic analysis for \nthe PBL since its impact is interdependent with that of the project loan and will be captured through \nthe project benefits. The economic analysis shows that all benefit categories are economically \nviable, with energy savings having the highest economic internal rate of return, followed by flood \nprevention. The economic internal rate of return for the overall program is 14.6%, and the net \npresent value at a 9.0% discount rate is $163.1 million. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the \nprogram will maintain its economic viability under most plausible scenarios. \n \n26.  Financial analysis. The financial analysis was carried out following ADB guidelines.33  \nAll project components are nonrevenue generating, and thus the analysis focuses on the financial \nsustainability of the project. The financial sustainability analysis assessed the financial capacity \nof the XMG to cover the incremental recurrent costs, including operation and maintenance \nexpenditures required to ensure the sustainability of the project. The fiscal analysis showed that \nthe total project incremental costs will have a negligible impact on the budget of the XMG, \nconfirming the project\u2019s sustainability.34 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n27.  The sustainability of the XSDP is supported by a solid institutional setup at the XMG as \nthe PMO is led by the secretary-general of XMG who is directly reporting to the Xiangtan Mayor, \nand  has  full-time  designated  staff  from  all  the  relevant  bureaus  as  PMO  members;  close \ninvolvement of the HPG as an oversight and supervision authority since the SDP concept stage; \nand the following measures to improve sustainability of the project. The design of the XSDP \nincorporates cost-recovery and revenue-generation aspects by enhancing energy and resource-\nefficient measures and technologies under the project. The XSDP also includes policy actions, \n \n33 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 The impact of the incremental costs from 2021 to 2045 is estimated to be 0.14%\u20131.52% of the XMG\u2019s annual fiscal \nrevenue. \n ", "11 \ncreating a range of market-oriented fees and charges that generate revenue, improve the quality \nof public services, and direct low-carbon behavior.35  \n \n28.  The XMG remains committed to low-carbon transformation and will support other cities to \nreplicate a low-carbon city model through the establishment of the Asia Low-Carbon Training \nCenter. The fiscal and debt management assessment that was carried out as part of the XSDP\u2019s \ndue diligence concluded that the XMG\u2019s public finances, including debt service obligations, are \nsustainable in the medium to long term.36 The debt service-to-revenue ratio is projected to decline \nfrom 48% in 2016\u20132018 to 35% by 2030. The project will have a limited impact on the XMG\u2019s \nfiscal and debt position; the XMG\u2019s debt position remains sustainable and debt service obligations \ncontinue to be affordable. The analysis (footnote 36) covered projections for 2019\u20132030 and was \npredicated upon the XMG\u2019s current fiscal and debt policies, the HPG\u2019s debt management strategy, \nand ADB\u2019s estimates of economic growth in Xiangtan city. COVID-19 could deteriorate the short-\nterm prospects for economic growth in Xiangtan and the fiscal revenue of the XMG, but it is not \nexpected to affect the medium- to long-term prospects,37 as confirmed by the IMF (footnote 3). \n \nD.  Governance \n \n29.  The ADB program team carried out the financial management and procurement capacity \nassessments  per  ADB  requirements.  The  overall  pre-mitigation  financial  management  is \nassessed as satisfactory, with the XMG capable of funds flow arrangements, staffing, accounting, \nfinancial reporting systems, internal and external auditing arrangements, and financial information \nsystems. The overall financial management risk rating of the project without mitigating measures \nis moderate. The program team conducted strategic procurement planning to ensure that fit-for-\npurpose procurement approaches are developed to achieve value for money and the project\u2019s \ndevelopment  objectives.  The  overall  procurement  risk  is  moderate  and  relevant  mitigation \nmeasures are in the risk assessment and risk management plan.38 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the XMG. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. To enhance procurement \ncapacity, the XMG initiated the engagement process of a qualified and experienced tendering \nagency for procurement support. Qualified staff from relevant bureaus were designated in the \nPMO. The PMC firm will provide continuous hands-on project management support and capacity \nbuilding training to the PMO staff and other relevant government staff. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n30.  The project will benefit an urban population of about 1.08 million, including 16,171 poor \npeople (of whom 7,223 are female, 1,161 elderly, and 2,273 disabled) through (i) enhanced quality \nof bus service and customer satisfaction with improved trunk roads, feeder roads, bus stops, and \nnew electric buses; (ii) safer travel and inclusive access for pedestrians and cyclists through \nimproved bikeways and sidewalks; and (iii) reduced economic losses with increased flood-\n \n35 Advanced technologies and measures to improve resource and energy efficiency at the hospital will significantly \nlower the operational costs. The XMG will introduce the following policy actions: (i) vehicle parking fees in Xiangtan, \n(ii) demand-driven bus services (e.g., a peak-hour express bus) with increased bus fares, (iii) new neighborhood bus \nservices, and (iv) market-based shared bicycle fees with upgraded bicycle services. \n36 Fiscal and Debt Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 While the COVID-19 pandemic may impact on the economic activity and taxes collected, its effects are likely to be \nrestricted to late 2019 and 2020, thus implying a downward risk for the short-term outlook underpinning the baseline \nscenario. No effects are to be expected in the medium to long term. The baseline scenario\u2019s projections extending \nfor more than a decade still hold despite the short-term effect of the pandemic. \n38 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12 \nresilient measures. The new hospital will be flood resilient and will provide uninterrupted services \nduring flooding events. Low-carbon and resilient features in 20 aging urban communities will \nprovide a cleaner, greener, safer, and more livable environment to 179,806 residents, including \n88,530 female, 49,616 elderly, and 3,672 poor residents. The project will create more than 2,000 \njob opportunities during construction and more than 700 during operation. Indirectly, the program \nwill promote economic growth and related employment generation. \n \n31.  Gender. The project is categorized some gender elements. Even though surveys done \nduring the program due diligence show no significant difference between males and females on \ndistance, frequency, and mode choice of travel, females are more worried about road safety, \nparticularly children\u2019s safety. Older females, or those escorting children or the elderly, expressed \ntheir concern on safe and easy access to sidewalks and road crossings. Females are much more \nconscious about energy, water, and gas savings as well as low-carbon practices, but show a \nlower level of survey participation. The majority of the female respondents support the project, as \nit will enhance their quality of life through an improved urban environment and the generation of \njob opportunities. The XMG developed the social and gender action plan and will implement it to \nensure women\u2019s participation in public hearings; awareness raising; and public consultations \nrelated to the program, targeting at least 40% women\u2019s participation.39 The XMG will engage a \nsocial and gender development consultant as a part of the PMC firm to support the XMG in \nimplementing and monitoring gender-sensitive actions. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n32.  Environment (category B). The XMG prepared an initial environmental examination \n(IEE),  including  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  per  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009). Construction  dust, noise, wastewater, and solid wastes;  community and \nworker\u2019s health and safety risks; and traffic disruptions will be the primary adverse impacts during \nconstruction. Potential negative operation phase impacts include air pollution, noise, wastewater, \nand waste. As they are short term and localized, good construction practices and measures \nindicated in the EMP will reduce impacts to acceptable levels. The XMG will establish a project-\nspecific grievance redress mechanism. The XMG has committed to implementing the EMP, \ngrievance redress mechanism, and relevant training, with support from a loan implementation \nenvironment consultant. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the XMG carried out consultations \nusing  a  popular  social  network  application  and  the  XMG  will  conduct  in-person  public \nconsultations during implementation.40 The XMG prepared the environmental impact matrix of the \npolicy actions under the PBL and included in the IEE, confirming no adverse environmental \nimpacts. The program team disclosed the IEE and EMP on the ADB website on 17 April 2020.  \nAs the climate risk screening was medium, the program team performed a climate risk and \nvulnerability assessment confirming that the increased rainfall intensity of individual storm events \nmay result in peak flows with flood risks to Xiangtan, particularly in areas with insufficient drainage \ncapacity. The program team conducted a more detailed risk assessment on pluvial flooding and \nfed into the XCRCT.41 The XCRCT was used for the project design as it allows users to select \n \n39 The social and gender action plan is included in the PAM. It includes an action that gives priority to qualified female \ndrivers over male drivers for new positions. \n40 The XMG bureaus and offices reached out through a social network application and obtained more than 1,000 \nresponses from project-affected people, satisfying the Safeguard Policy Statement requirements on meaningful \npublic consultation. \n41 It included analysis of flood hazards, topography analysis, land use assessment, and damage sensitivity; and \nassessment of the required retention, detention, and/or storage capacity against floods. The Xiangtan pluvial flood \nhazards map was developed for a rainstorm with a 100-year return period. \n ", "13 \nspecific EBA interventions in specific areas immediately, and to see the estimated resilience \ncapacity improvement and the associated costs. \n \n33.  Involuntary resettlement (category C) and indigenous peoples (category C). Land \nrequired for the construction of the hospital (80.03 mu) and the Liwei Substation (8.03 mu) was \nacquired  by  the  XMG  for  local  area  development  in  2017  and  2013,  respectively  without \nanticipating ADB financing. Due diligence confirmed that there is no outstanding or legacy issue \non the land allocated for the project. Other components will not induce any physical or economic \ndisplacement. The population of scattered ethnic minorities in Xiangtan municipality accounts for \n0.49% of the total municipal population. The program will benefit all residents and will not have \ndifferential impacts on any specific ethnic minority communities that will trigger ADB\u2019s indigenous \npeoples\u2019 policy requirements. For the PBL, the safeguards assessment confirmed that policy \nactions will not result in involuntary resettlement or impacts on indigenous peoples\u2019 communities. \nOn 17 April 2020, the program team disclosed the social safeguard due diligence report on the \nADB website, including the safeguards assessment matrix. \n \n34.  Impacts  on  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  program  team  used  the  integrated \nassessment models presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change after being \nscaled down for Xiangtan to develop the worst-case and best-case GHG trajectories for 2020\u2013\n2045. In the first year after project completion, GHG emissions reduction will be more than 337 \nkilotons of carbon dioxide equivalent (ktCO e). Combining the project and the PBL will lead to a \n2\nreduction of more than 770 ktCO e in 2026. The total amount of GHG reduction over the project \n2\nlifetime to 2045 will be more than 7 MtCO e with an annual average of 378 ktCO e. During the \n2 2\nprogram lifetime to 2045, total GHG reduction will be more than 48 MtCO e with an annual \n2\naverage of 2.4 MtCO e. The project will contribute 5% and the combined project and PBL will \n2\ncontribute 29% to the required cumulative abatement.42  \n \nG.
