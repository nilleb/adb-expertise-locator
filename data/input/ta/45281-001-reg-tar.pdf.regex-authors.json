", "   \n \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Road safety in the Asia and Pacific region is recognized as an alarming economic, \nhealth, poverty and social development problem. Specifically, it is estimated that the developing \nmember countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) suffer over 645,000 deaths \nand 30 million injuries annually due to road accidents, at a cost to the society of around $96 \nbillion per year (more than all development assistance provided). Road deaths are concentrated \namong vulnerable road users: people from poorer households account for 50% of deaths in \nWestern Asia and the Pacific, and 75% of deaths in South Asia, while 7 out of 10 poor families \nsuffer decreased income after a death or disability.1 \n \n2.  Recognizing  the  scale  and  urgency  of  the  problem,  the  United  Nations  General \nAssembly proclaimed 2011\u20132020 (commenced in May 2011) as the Decade of Action for Road \nSafety, and urged development banks and funding agencies to provide adequate and additional \nfunding  for  activities  relating  to  road  safety.  A  joint  statement  was  issued  by  multilateral \ndevelopment banks, including ADB, in which they committed to mobilize more resources to \nimprove  road  safety  in  DMCs.  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable  Transport  Initiative:  Operational  Plan2 \nidentified road safety as one of the four key areas that needed to be mainstreamed to achieve a \nportfolio conductive to the development of sustainable transport in DMCs.   \n \n3.  The governments of Bhutan and Nepal are committed to the improvement of road safety \nin line with the goals of the Decade of Action for Road Safety and are developing national road \nsafety strategies (or plans) for 2011\u20132020. These documents will provide a general framework \nfor  road  safety  activities  over  the  decade,  but  implementation  will  require  development  of \ndetailed programs and creation of institutional capacity, structures and funding mechanisms that \nsupport effective implementation. Without proper implementation support and sufficient road \nsafety capacity the strategies and plans may not be implemented, as evidenced by experience \nwith numerous action plans in South Asia that were adopted but virtually remained on paper. \nPhase 1 of this regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) (focusing on Bhutan \nand Nepal) will provide much-needed support to increase the capacity of key road safety \ncounterparts and develop the most urgently needed, cost-effective road safety improvement \nprograms. The TA will contribute to implementation of ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative: \nOperational Plan, and the Operational Plan for Improving Health Access and Outcomes under \nStrategy 2020.3 A similar TA is ongoing in Bangladesh, and it is anticipated that a subsequent \nphase 2 (focusing on India and Sri Lanka) will start in 2013. \n \n4.  ADB fielded a fact-finding mission to Bhutan and Nepal in November 2011, and reached \nagreement with both governments on all aspects of the proposed TA including impact, outcome, \noutputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for \nconsulting services. The TA was included in the regional cooperation operations business plan4 \nfor processing in 2012, but phase 1 (Bhutan and Nepal) was advanced to 2011.

", "2   \n   \n \npaper was approved by the vice president on 16 September 2011. The design and monitoring \nframework (DMF) is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n5.  The situation with road safety in Nepal has severely deteriorated. Over the last decade, \nthe number of road fatalities has almost doubled, reaching 1,689 fatalities in fiscal year (FY) \n2011, and the number of serious injures increased by almost nine times, reaching 4,071 in FY \n2011. More than 9,000 people have lost their lives in road crashes over the past decade. \nNepal\u2019s fatality rate in FY 2010 was 17 per 10,000 registered vehicles, which is the highest rate \nin Asia and one of the highest in the world. Because of the fast traffic growth in the country \n(annual growth of 16% for motorcycles and 13% for all vehicle types), it is anticipated that the \nroad safety situation in Nepal will deteriorate further if adequate road safety measures are not \ntaken.  \n \n6.  In Bhutan, around 650 people have been killed on roads over the last decade (2001\u2013\n2010) and the number is growing. The average annual level of fatalities over 2008\u20132010 was \naround  56%  higher  than  during  2001\u20132003.  The  fatality  rate  (annual  fatalities  per  10,000 \nvehicles) reached about 15 in 2010, which is higher than in most other South Asian countries, \nand around 7\u201310 times higher than in Europe and North America. It is predicted that if urgent \ncountermeasures are not taken, the current annual number of deaths will double by 2020 and \nincrease by almost 5 times by 2030. \n \n7.  Institutional arrangements, capacities, business procedures and tools are inadequate in \nboth Nepal and Bhutan to deal with the road safety problem. In Nepal, a National Road Safety \nCouncil was officially set up during 1990s but has not become functional. In the absence of a \nlead road safety agency, road safety work is poorly coordinated. In Bhutan, the role of a lead \nagency is carried out by the Road Safety and Transport Authority, but it lacks the capacity to \ncarry out this role, and the roles and responsibilities of road safety counterparts have not been \nformally established. Both countries lack a mechanism for dedicated funding of road safety \nactivities, and the amount spent on road safety in both countries is not commensurate with the \ndemand and scale of the problem. There is no regional collaborative mechanism on road safety, \nwhich hampers sharing of best practices and harmonization of road safety design standards and \npractices.  \n \n8.  Typical issues faced by the agencies responsible for road safety in Nepal and Bhutan \nare similar. Road agencies lack capacity, procedures, data, and tools to (a) conduct annual and \nlonger-term  road  safety  programming  and  budgeting,  (b)  incorporate  road  safety  into  the \nlifecycle  of  roads,  and  (c)  develop  effective  road  safety  solutions  and  design  standards. \nTransport agencies lack (a) functional accident data management systems; (b) basic training, \ninfrastructure, and equipment to conduct vehicle road safety inspections and driver testing; (c) \ncapacity to develop road safety legislature; and (d) capacity, data and tools to conduct analytical \nroad safety work. Traffic police lack the capacity and traffic surveillance equipment to ensure \nsystematic deterrence from traffic violations. Traffic police collect accident data at a rudimentary \nlevel  without  using  approaches  based  on  a  geographic  information  system  for  recording \naccident locations, while specialized training for traffic police is practically non-existent. Health \nauthorities (a) lack national and jurisdictional  trauma care command centers that connect all \nhospitals, primary trauma care centers, and ambulances into a network based on a geographic \ninformation system; (b) have a very underdeveloped network of primary trauma care centers; \n                                                \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 September 2011.

Educational system lacks (a) a dedicated avenue to prepare road safety professionals, \nand (b) programs for road safety education in schools.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact of the regional capacity development TA (phase 1: Bhutan and Nepal) will be \nsustainable and cost-effective improvement of road safety in Bhutan and Nepal. The target is to \nsubstantially reduce the growing trend of road traffic fatalities by 2020. The outcome will be \nSouth Asia Road Safety Programs (phase 1: Bhutan and Nepal) ready for subsequent design \nand implementation.6 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA is designed to achieve the intended outcome through advisory support, on-the-\njob  training,  and  knowledge  transfer  by  a  team  of  experts  with  international  and  national \nqualifications, and through specific, time-bound, and measurable outputs. The outputs include: (i) \nroad safety diagnosis, (ii) road safety programs on selected corridors with regional importance, \n(iii) strengthening of road safety management capacity, (iv) regional road safety collaborative \nmechanism for South Asia, (v) road safety policies and business procedures to incorporate road \nsafety into the lifecycle of roads, (vi) sustainable funding arrangements for road safety, (vii) \nSouth Asia Road Safety Programs (phase 1), and (viii) draft DMFs (\u201cblueprints\u201d) for subsequent \nroad safety investment projects. Road safety programs will target the improvement of road \nsafety for all road users, with an emphasis on vulnerable road user groups.  \n \n11.  The proposed methodology will ensure that TA resources are used as efficiently as \npossible, and that there is synergy between different consulting outputs. Specifically, the road \nsafety diagnosis will identify gaps, deficiencies, and the potential for improvement and prepare a \nset of recommendations for review, approval and early action by the governments. Corridors will \nbe  selected  to  ensure  that  future  investments  in  both  physical  infrastructure  and  non-\nengineering components have the highest demonstration and replication potential. Road safety \nsolutions and standards developed while preparing the safe corridor program will be used for \nsubsequent  preparation  of  South  Asia  road  safety  programs  and  multisectoral  investment \nblueprints. The new mechanisms for road safety funding and improvement of the capacity and \ninstitutional structure, combined with new road safety policies and tools will ensure that (i) road \nsafety is incorporated in the lifecycle of roads, (ii) non-engineering road safety programs can be \nmore effectively handled by road transport agencies, and (iii) focal agencies are capable of \nhandling externally funded road safety TA and multisectoral road safety investment projects. \nDevelopment of the South Asia Road Safety Improvement Programs (phase 1: Bhutan and \nNepal) and DMF will be based on the road safety diagnosis, will incorporate the government\u2019s \nfeedback on draft recommendations prepared at the outset of the assignment, and will serve as \na blueprint for the multisectoral road safety investment project that could be proposed for ADB \nfinancing.  The  regional  road  safety  collaborative  mechanism\u2014which  will  be  established  to \ninclude Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka\u2014will contribute to the dissemination of \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                \n6  The term \u201cdesign\u201d refers to all subsequent preparatory activities, after the regional capacity development TA, \nincluding  the  feasibility  study  for  infrastructure  investments,  feasibility  and  detailing  of  non-engineering \ncomponents, and preparation of road designs. \n ", "4   \n   \n \nbest practices, harmonization of road safety standards and procedures, and scaling up of joint \nefforts to improve road safety in the region. \n  \n12.  Key risks for the TA and implementation of its recommendations and programs include \ninadequate  financing  for  road  safety,  and  indecision  and  lack  of  ownership  of  the  TA \nrecommendations and programs by the implementing agencies. The risks will be mitigated by \nthe government\u2019s acceptance of the sustainable funding mechanisms to be developed by the \nTA,  and  through  establishment  of  a  results-oriented  project  organizational  structure.  The \nconsultant will conduct four workshops at key steps during the TA implementation to explain the \nresults, recommendations, and programs, and seek feedback. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $700,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The governments of Bhutan and \nNepal will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, part-time support staff, \nand office space. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. The consultants engaged under the TA will \nwork closely with the focal agencies in each country, including the following:7   \n(i)  Bhutan.  Ministry  of  Information  and  Communications  (Road  Safety  and \nTransport Authority), and Ministry of Works and Human Settlement (Department \nof Roads and Policy & Planning Division); and  \n(ii)  Nepal. Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (Department of Roads), and \nMinistry  of  Labor  and  Transport  Management  (Department  of  Transport \nManagement). \n \n15.  For the tasks of establishing the regional collaborative mechanism, the  TA will also work \nclosely with the following agencies in Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka:  \n(i)   Bangladesh.  Ministry of Communications (Roads and Highway Department, \nRoad Transport Authority); \n(ii)  India. Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways (National Highway \nAuthority of India); and \n(iii)  Sri Lanka. Ministry of Ports and Highways (Road Development Authority). \n \n16.  Focal agencies will ensure proper level of review of the TA deliverables, and take early \nactions towards implementation, including actions to reorganize existing or establish new road \nsafety management institutions.     \n17.  The TA will be carried out by a firm of international consultants in association with national \nconsultants.  Individual  (international)  consultant  on  the  international  road  assessment \nprogramme will be engaged to provide inputs in specialized areas of expertise. The firm will be \nengaged using quality- and cost-based selection with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. Simplified \ntechnical proposals will be requested. International experts will include a road safety expert and \nteam leader (9 person-months), and road safety engineer (5 person-months). National experts \n(24 person-months in total) will include country-based highway design engineers (4 person-\n                                                \n7  Additional focal agencies will be identified in the course of processing and implementation of TA, to ensure a \nmutisectoral approach. Specifically, health authorities, traffic police, and educational bodies should be involved.

Around 65% of the international inputs will be provided in Nepal and 35% in Bhutan. \nThe consultant will closely interact with the firm engaged under the ongoing road safety TA in \nBangladesh8 to  share  experiences  and  lessons,  and  discuss  and  harmonize  road  safety \nsolutions. The outline terms of reference (i) for the firm are in Appendix 3, and (ii) for the \nindividual consultant on the international road assessment programme are in Appendix 4.  \n18.  All consultants will be selected by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be made in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). Equipment will be procured by the consultants using shopping procedures in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nEquipment will be turned over to the governments of Bhutan and Nepal (focal agencies) after \ncompletion of the TA.9 \n \n19.  The TA (phase 1) will be implemented over the period of 12 months, from June 2012 to \nJune  2013.  Findings  and  results  will  be  disseminated  at  the  following  workshops,  to  be \nconducted  both  in  Bhutan  and  Nepal:  (i)  road  safety  diagnosis  and  recommendations;  (ii) \nstrengthening road safety management capacity, road safety funding, policies and business \nprocedures; (iii) road safety programs on selected high-risk corridors; and (iv) South Asia Road \nSafety Programs, Phase 1 and blueprint of investment projects. The latter workshop will also be \nconducted at the regional level with participation of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Sri \nLanka. Also, the findings and results will be shared with the multilateral development bank \nworkgroup on road safety.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis for \nthe South Asia Road Safety Programs (Phase 1: Kingdom of Bhutan and Nepal), and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2011.

The consultant will (i) obtain and review all \nnecessary information, accident data, reports, existing proposals, strategies, and action plans; \nand  (ii)  conduct (a)  interviews  with  key  road safety counterparts  in each  country,  and  (b) \nassociated review and analyses.  \n \n2.  The assessment will be done in each country for (i) the road safety management system \nas a whole, and (ii) on an agency-specific basis. Based on the analysis, the consultant will \nidentify gaps,  deficiencies,  and  potential  improvements,  and  prepare a  set  of most  urgent \nrecommendations  for  review  and  in  principle  approval  by  the  governments.  These \nrecommendations will enhance road safety action plans if already in place; once approved, they \nwill create a basis for development of a blueprint for the road safety investment, which could be \npotentially funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and/or other development partners.  \n \n3.  Task 2: Prepare road safety programs on selected high-risk corridors. The selected \ncorridors will be on the national highway systems, with regional importance and high accident \nrisks.  The  selection  of  high-risk  corridors  (up  to  300  kilometers  [km]  in  length  in  the  two \ncountries, with around 100 km in Bhutan and 200 km in Nepal) will be done in consultation with \nthe road agencies in each country and will include an analysis of available accident data and a \nreview of other relevant information, such as existing and proposed road improvement programs, \nnetwork screening data and analyses, and other factors, such as the potential for demonstration \nand the viability of using infrastructure-intensive measures. Because the demonstration and \nreplication potential is one intended purpose, the selected corridors should be compatible with \ninfrastructure-intensive  measures.1 Other  factors  (e.g.,  compatibility  with  the  Road  Sector \nMaster Plan) should also be taken into account. The corridor safety program may also possibly \nbe combined with other planned road upgrading projects. \n \n4.  The development of the corridor programs will involve road safety audits (RSAs), accident \ndata  analyses,  and  other  appropriate  techniques.  The  programs  will  not  be  limited  to \ninfrastructure  measures,  but  will  include  \u201csoft\u201d,  non-physical  components.  To  this  end,  the \nconsultant will discuss the proposed pilot multisectoral approach on the corridors with respective \ncentral-level ministries, and visit communities, traffic police stations, and hospitals along the \ncorridors to discuss non-engineering measures (e.g., awareness, safe routes to schools, and \nenforcement  improvements,  including  automatic  surveillance,  emergency  response,  and \nsecurity)2 that  can  be  implemented.  Health  care  providers  and  private  sector  companies \noperating in the corridor areas will also be consulted on additional measures that could be \nsupported, such as highway rescue programs. Road agencies and project implementation units \nin charge of the corridors will be consulted regarding measures to strengthen their road safety \ncapacity,  in  order  to  ensure  road  safety-related  investments  in  road  infrastructure  are \nsustainable.  \n                                                \n1  This  may  include  roadside  safety  hardware;  widening;  physical  separation  of  opposing  traffic  flows;  grade \nseparation; pedestrian sidewalks, overpasses or underpasses; frontage roads; separate motorcycle or bike ways; \nintelligent transportation systems; rail overpasses or  bypasses, etc. \n2  In addition to road safety issues, the consultant will also assess cases of sexual harassment on roadways, and \nrecommend (i) measures for better training of police in handling such cases, and/or (ii) a road users\u2019 education \nprogram that includes sanctions for sexual harassment. The consultant will also include an assessment of the \nfeasibility of installing specific safety design features such as street lighting, public phones, and cameras on roads \nto deter the commission of specific types of crimes that constrain the mobility of the elderly, women, children and \ndisabled. Such measures can also be considered in the development of a regional program (task 7).  ", "Appendix 3       11 \n \n \n5.
