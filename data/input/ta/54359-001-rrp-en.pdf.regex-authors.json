THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $50,000,000 or its yuan equivalent to Henan Tian Lun Gas Group Limited (HTL) for the \nHenan Tian Lun Resilient Energy Supply Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n \n2.  The project will support a private sector company contributing to air pollution mitigation \nalongside the Air Quality Improvement in the Greater Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei (BTH) Region\u2014\nHenan Cleaner Fuel Switch Investment Program of the East Asia Department (EARD).1 The \nproject will support HTL\u2019s efforts to supply sustained last-mile city natural gas to residential, \ncommercial, and industrial end users in Henan Province. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. In the PRC, natural gas plays an important role as a cleaner and \nlower carbon emitting alternative to coal, which remains a dominant component of the primary \nenergy and electricity generation mix. Fuel switching is a policy priority of the government to \naddress chronic air pollution. Natural gas is consumed by residential consumers primarily for \nheating and cooking, and by commercial and industrial consumers in power and heat generation \nand in industrial processes. When it is made available to end users, natural gas can directly \nreplace coal consumption and/or displace predominantly coal-generated grid electricity. \n \n4.  Under a One Asian Development Bank (ADB) approach, the Private Sector Operations \nDepartment (PSOD) identified HTL as a private sector company supplying natural gas in the \nurban areas of Henan Province during the processing of the Air Quality Improvement in the \nGreater BTH Region\u2014Henan Cleaner Fuel Switch Investment Program led by EARD. HTL jointly \noperates Yu-Tian New Energy Company Limited, the company that will be an implementation \nagent for the fuel switching program, and which will provide last-mile natural gas connections to \nend-users in the BTH region. PSOD followed up with HTL to support with a private sector solution \ncontributing to sustainable air quality improvement. Faced with prolonging energy bill payment \ndelays from its customers, HTL requested that ADB provide a facility to help meet working capital \nneeds, thereby ensuring its financial sustainability and capacity to sustain uninterrupted natural \ngas supplies in Henan Province. \n \n5.  To enhance the resilience of cities, the Government of the PRC issued directives urging \nproviders of essential utility services to ensure the uninterrupted supply of electricity, gas, and \nheating,  while  concurrently  extending  consumers\u2019  payment  terms.  [CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] The purpose of the government directives is to support consumers of \nessential utility services, who experienced a severe economic shock due to pandemic lockdowns, \nin recovering economically. While the directives are effective, HTL still needs to pay for the \nprocurement of natural gas supplies at the city gate. It is expected that these directives will remain \nin effect through at least the end of 2021, with increasing numbers of end users being sold energy \nsupplies on extended payment terms, leading to increased working capital needs for essential \nutilities. \n \n \n1  ADB. 2021. Proposed Results Based Loan, People\u2019s Republic of China: Air Quality Improvement in the Greater \nBeijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei Region\u2014Henan Cleaner Fuel Switch Investment Program. Manila (52007-001-PRC). \n ", "2 \n6.  As an essential utility, HTL has been directed to sustain service provision, notwithstanding \nthe extension of payment terms for its customers. HTL, as a last-mile city gas distributor, has to \npay for procured gas at the city gate as it is supplied, and earns only a regulated margin on \nvolumes from end users inside cities, which have been delayed in receipt as they are subject to \nthe extended billing cycle. As a result, HTL faces an estimated net working capital increase \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]. \n \n7.  Project design. The loan will support HTL\u2019s natural gas distribution operations for about \n510,000 residential and business customers in Henan Province. This will help HTL and five \noperating subsidiaries2 ensure timely, uninterrupted procurement of upstream energy supplies for \ndistribution to end users through existing distribution networks within each subsidiary\u2019s operating \nfootprint, even as outstanding bills from those end users grow. \n \n8.  Sustained and reliable delivery of natural gas through this project will help households, \ncommercial, and industrial end users reduce fuel expenditure, save time because of more efficient \ncooking and heating, improve respiratory health. A disruption in local natural gas supplies will lead \nto an increasing likelihood of end users having to rely on alternative energy sources including \npredominantly coal-generated grid electricity and would also discourage adoption of natural gas \nas a cleaner fuel alternative which would negatively impact air pollution and the adoption of \nclimate change mitigating infrastructure investments in the region. \n \n9.  Gender  context.  While  the  PRC\u2019s  growth  and  development  have  led  to  notable \nsocioeconomic progress, gender inequality has been increasing. Social transformation in the PRC \nhas resulted in a gender gap in the labor market and intensified conflict between work and family \nas traditional views of gender roles persist. Women spend an average of almost 4 hours per day \non unpaid care work, 2.5 times more time than men. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic has aggravated these inequalities faced by women who are juggling work with added \ndomestic duties, which multiplies if a family member becomes sick.3 Access to clean energy \nsources is likely to have a positive impact on the health and well-being of women.4 Use of modern \nfuels such as gas for cooking can reduce women\u2019s work and time burden and reduce indoor and \noutdoor pollution. The time saved can be used by women to improve their and their families\u2019 lives \nthrough education, income generation, or leisure.5 \n \n10.  Sponsor and guarantor. Headquartered in Henan Province, PRC, China Tian Lun Gas \nHoldings  Limited  (CTL),  the  project  sponsor  and  guarantor,  is  a  private  sector  company \nincorporated in the Cayman Islands and is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange6. It began \noperations  in  2004,  following  the  government's  2002  policy  decision  to  open  natural  gas \ndistribution to private sector participation. It was one of the earliest non-state-owned enterprises \nin the urban gas sector in the PRC. CTL\u2019s primary activities are constructing and operating city \ngas pipelines and supplying natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial end users \n \n2  The five operating subsidiaries are Xuchang Tianlun Gas Co., Ltd., Zhengzhou Shangjie District Tianlun Gas Co., \nLtd., Henan Tianlun Gas Pipe Network Co., Ltd., Xiping Kaida Gas Co., Ltd. and Shenqiu County Huixin Natural Gas \nCo., Ltd. \n3  United Nations Development Program. 2020.

Other  business  lines  include  engineering  and \nconstruction of gas distribution infrastructure and long-haul gas transmission pipelines. Recently, \nCTL has focused on fuel switching, substituting coal and coal gas for natural gas. CTL is one of \nthe largest gas distribution companies in Henan Province and has a substantial presence in 13 \nprovinces across the PRC. CTL manages itself and HTL in accordance with the mandatory \nrequirements of corporate governance norms specified by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Its \ngovernance structure broadly comprises the board of directors and the committees of the board \nat the group level, and the senior management at the operational level. The board of directors \ncomprises  four  executive  directors  and four  independent  directors.  CTL  also  has  a  highly \nexperienced management team with technical and financial capabilities. Responsibilities and \nauthorities are clearly divided between management and the board of directors. \n \n11.  Borrower. The borrower is HTL, a wholly owned subsidiary of CTL incorporated in 2004 \nin the PRC, contributing 97% of CTL\u2019s total revenues. As of fiscal year (FY) 2019, HTL had 23 \nurban gas projects and one long-haul transmission pipeline in Henan Province, four urban gas \nprojects in Shandong Province, and two urban gas projects in both Gansu Province and Sichuan \nProvince. The company is the largest provider of piped gas in Henan Province and is connected \nto 3.2 million residential consumers and more than 23,000 industrial and commercial users. \nRevenues are primarily derived from city gas sales, installation fees, and long-haul pipeline gas \nsales. As of FY2019, HTL reported total assets of CNY11.31 billion, and revenues of CNY6.37 \nbillion. \n \n12.  Integrity  due  diligence.  ADB  conducted  integrity  due  diligence. 7  HTL,  CTL,  its \nshareholders, ultimate beneficial owners, and board of directors do not appear to constitute a \nsignificant or potentially significant integrity risk, as no unresolved adverse media or other relevant \nintegrity-related information is associated with them. ADB\u2019s review of HTL and CTL does not give \nADB cause to believe that it is being used for money laundering or terrorism financing. \n \n13.  Tax integrity due diligence. ADB conducted tax integrity due diligence.8 ADB obtained \nreasonable assurance that the transaction is not being used for tax secrecy, tax evasion, or tax \nfraud. \n \n14.  Pandemic impacts. The government\u2019s essential utility directive has led to a sharp \nincrease in reported receivables for HTL: 44 days as of FY2019 to 75 days as of H12020. This \nadditional latitude in payment terms is being provided by HTL following the government\u2019s essential \nutilities directive to support the post-pandemic recovery. In financial terms, HTL\u2019s accounts \nreceivables were reported at CNY776 million at the end of 2019, having increased to CNY1,219 \nmillion as of H12020 [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]. HTL is seeking to mitigate the \nincreased working capital requirement through ADB\u2019s financing of the project. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n15.  Impact. The project will support economic and social activities in Henan Province to \ncontinue. \n \n \n7  ADB. 2003.

Further information is in Client Information and Integrity and Tax Due Diligence (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \n16.  Outcome. The project will support the continuity of economic and social activities using \nnatural gas in Henan Province.  \n \n17.  Outputs. The project will have the following outputs: (i) natural gas supplied to residents \nand businesses in cities in Henan Province on credit sustained, (ii) supply of natural gas on credit \nand favorable terms for households with a single mother in Henan Province sustained, (iii) \nsupplies of basic child and maternal necessities to households with a single mother in Henan \nProvince supported, and (iv) knowledge sharing related to the clean energy transition in the PRC \nincreased. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n18.  Consistency with ADB\u2019s strategy and country strategy. The project is aligned with \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  operational  priority  2  (accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality)  and \noperational priority 4 (making cities more livable).9 HTL\u2019s Single Mother Care Action program, \nwhich will be implemented until the end of 2023 in line with the agreed ADB gender action plan \n(GAP), directly addresses the economic and social welfare of households with a single mother \nsupplied by HTL\u2019s distribution network. Ensuring the supply of natural gas will mitigate urban air \npollution and enhance the resilience of cities as they continue to recover from the economic \nimpacts of the pandemic. The provision of gas to meet basic energy demand contributes to \nbuilding livable cities by providing uninterrupted access to energy in urban areas and surrounding \ncommunities. No climate mitigation or adaptation financing has been estimated for this project. \n \n19.  PRC country partnership strategy. The project addresses the first strategic priority of \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,  2021\u20132025,10 which  calls  for  supporting \nenvironmentally sustainable development and health security through private sector solutions, \nincluding last-mile connectivity and cleaner fuels (para. 36[iii] of the country partnership strategy). \n \n20.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project embodies \nADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Private Sector Operations, 2019\u20132024,11 and ADB's Energy Policy,12 \nwhich emphasizes energy security and universal access to energy. The policies encourage ADB \nto help developing member countries provide reliable, adequate, and affordable energy for \ninclusive growth in a socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable way. \n \n21.  Lessons  from  previous  operations.  Key  lessons  from  past  interventions  include \n(i) working with the last-mile service deliverer as a change agent for access to vulnerable \nhouseholds,13 (ii)  identifying  best-in-class  technical  operators  (from  the  public  and  private \nsectors)  capable  of  integrating  complex  gas  distribution  logistics,  (iii)  developing  a  good \nunderstanding of national and regional regulations to promote access to energy for different end \nusers\u2019 needs, and (iv) supporting transparency of the full gas distribution value chain, including \n \n9  ADB. 2018.

THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n26.  ADB will provide a loan of up to $50,000,000 or its yuan equivalent to fund HTL\u2019s working \ncapital requirements for purchases of natural gas in Henan Province from 2021 to 2023. ADB\u2019s \nloan will have a 2-year tenor, 2-year weighted average life, and bullet repayment. The covenant \npackage will be aligned with market standards to the borrower, will be unsecured, and will be \nguaranteed by the listed parent company, CTL. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n27.  Financial additionality. ADB\u2019s assistance is designed to fill a gap in the local financial \nmarket. HTL relies heavily on up to 1-year working capital facilities that are subject to monthly \nliquidity quota allocations, which can make urgently needed funds suddenly unavailable for \ndrawdown. Any longer-term financing HTL can procure is typically associated with fixed asset \ninvestment or acquisition and must be secured and specifically tied to that use of proceeds \naccordingly. ADB\u2019s 2-year unsecured bullet facility will greatly enhance HTL\u2019s financial flexibility \nas (i) it is a firmly committed loan that will not become unavailable because of tight local lending \nmarket liquidity; (ii) it has a longer tenor than typical working capital facilities in the PRC market, \nwith back-ended bullet maturity that can accommodate the timing uncertainty associated with \nprolonged end user payment delays; and (iii) it does not require additional security which is limited \nand HTL needs to make available for longer term capex financing. \n \n28.  Nonfinancial additionality. ADB\u2019s engagement with this project will promote gender \ninclusiveness in HTL\u2019s operations through the agreed GAP. Building upon EARD\u2019s previous \nsupport for corporate governance and environmental and social management system (ESMS) \nenhancement,  ADB  provides  a  corporate-wide  ESMS  audit  and  supports  HTL  in  the \nimplementation of robust environmental, social, and health management practices. Finally, with \nADB Energy Sector Group technical expertise and a knowledge-sharing workshop, the project \nwill support HTL in developing a corporate strategy aligned with the PRC clean energy transition. \nAny relevant learnings from the workshop will be disseminated to other developing member \ncountries and stakeholders as appropriate. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n35.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment (category C), involuntary resettlement (category C), \nand indigenous peoples (category C).16 \n36.  ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the project and measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts in the safeguard reports and plans.

The loan will be for working capital purposes only and will not be \nused to fund any new or ongoing projects that involve permanent or temporary land acquisition; \nany retrofits, rehabilitation, or expansion projects; or any activities that may directly or indirectly \naffect indigenous peoples or vulnerable ethnic minorities or scheduled tribes. The project activities \nare likely to have no adverse additional environmental impacts. \n \n37.  The International Finance Corporation (IFC) invested in CTL for a project in 2015 and \nprescribed an environmental and social action plan.17 As CTL had an ESMS in place at the time, \nthe action plan focused on the establishment of a corporate-level environment, health, and safety \n(EHS) department and the development of new quantitative risk assessment and risk audit \npolicies and procedures. IFC reported in its public disclosure that the company had completed all \ntasks by January 2016. The implementing agency for the ADB 2019 sovereign program loan \ninvolving CTL (Henan Yu-Tian New Energy Co. Ltd.) is a joint venture company established by \nHTL and a state-owned enterprise under the Henan Provincial Finance Bureau. HTL owns 40% \nof the joint venture company, which utilizes HTL personnel and infrastructure. The loan supports \nthe transition from coal to cleaner fuel for residential, commercial, and industrial users in select \nless-developed  counties  of  Henan  Province  by  expanding  the  gas  pipeline  network  and \ndeveloping a new alternative clean fuel biogas plant. Following ADB\u2019s extensive environmental \nand social due diligence, the project was placed in category B for environment and involuntary \nresettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. Through meetings with IFC and ADB \nsovereign counterparts, review of reporting to IFC and ADB, and assessment of the ESMS and \nother operational procedures, ADB\u2019s due diligence found that HTL is operating in conformance \nwith agreed and applicable requirements. \n \n38.  HTL operates in accordance with the ESMS followed by all CTL subsidiaries, which \nincludes EHS and stakeholder engagement policies and procedures for managing aspects of its \noperations that meet regulatory requirements and IFC\u2019s Performance Standards. CTL has a \ncorporate-level  EHS  department  responsible  for  safety  management,  environmental  and \noccupational health management, stakeholder engagement, production operation management, \nand loss management for existing operations and potential large projects. Through the EHS \ndepartment, HTL proactively identifies potential health and safety risks in the workplace to \ncontinuously improve occupational health management and to ensure that employees understand \nthe relevant risks and response measures. CTL publishes an annual environmental, social, and \ngovernance report in which it publicly discloses its EHS performance in the preceding year. The \n2019  annual  report  includes  coverage  of  personnel  safety  training  for  construction  and \nimprovements in safety management levels generally. HTL is also undergoing recertification for \nISO 9001 (Quality Management System) and OHSAS 18001 (Occupational Health and Safety \nManagement System). \n \n39.  Effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Single  mothers  represent  70%  of  single-parent \nhouseholds in the PRC. A 2020 study found that most single mothers had incomes that were not \nsufficient  to  meet  daily  expenses;  they  lacked  social  safety  nets,  had  low  wages,  limited \nemployment opportunities, and significant time-poverty, which increased the probability of them \nfalling into extreme poverty. The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated these inequalities (footnote \n4). Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (2003), HTL has incorporated measures \nto promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment in its business activities. Key features \nof the GAP are (i) at least 8,700 households with a single mother will be continuously supplied \nwith natural gas until the end of 2022 on favorable payment terms, including a 10% discount and \nan  additional  2-month  delay  in  payment  due  date;  and  (ii)  supplies  of  child  and  early \n \n17 IFC. 2015.

Households with children below the age of 3 will benefit from these \nmeasures. HTL will submit periodic reports on implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \n40.  HTL will (i) apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list, (ii) ensure that investments \nusing ADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and (iii) abide by \napplicable  national  laws  and  regulations.  HTL  human  resource  management  policies  and \nprocedures  ensure  it  operates  in  accordance  with  national  labor  laws  and  internationally \nrecognized core labor standards, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001). HTL\u2019s \nstakeholder  management  system  contains  requirements  for  information  disclosure  and \nconsultation  with  affected  people  following  national  requirements  that  conform  with  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements for the loan. HTL will report regularly to ADB on (i) its compliance with such laws \nand (ii) the measures taken.18 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n41.  HTL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.
