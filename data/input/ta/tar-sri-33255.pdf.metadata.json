During 1999 the Government of Sri Lanka requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide project preparatory technical assistance (TA) to support the preparation of a \nsector investment project that will address priority natural resource and environmental problems \nin key subsectors. The project will support the Government's initiatives to establish a consistent \nand integrated natural resource and environmental management (NREM) framework, to develop \nefficient systems, and to provide services in priority subsectors to effectively manage and \nmitigate adverse impacts on natural resources and the environment. An ADB TA Fact-Finding \nMission visited Sri Lanka during September 2002 and held discussions with the Treasury, \nMinistry of Policy Implementation-External Resources Department, Ministry of Environment and \nNatural Resources (MENR), Ministry of Lands,  Ministry of Western Region, Ministry of Home \nAffairs, provincial councils and local government, the World Bank, and the Royal Netherlands \nEmbassy. The Mission and the various Government agencies reached understanding on the TA \nobjectives, scope, cost, terms of reference, and implementation arrangements. The TA is \nincluded in the 2002 country program for Sri Lanka.1   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Government\u2019s vision for sustainable development requires strategies that support \neconomic growth and poverty reduction; the integration of economic, social, and environmental \naspects; and the active participation of all stakeholders. The sustainable management of natural \nresources will be essential if this vision is to be achieved.  \n \n3.  Currently  in  Sri  Lanka,  increasing  population  pressure  and  economic  growth  have \ndepleted renewable and nonrenewable resources, reduced the forest cover, degraded land and \nwater, encroached into protected areas, and produced adverse environmental impacts. These \nimpacts are detailed in Sri Lanka's State of the Environment Report, 2001, and affect all regions \nof the country. This loss of resources will increasingly constrain development and adversely \nimpact livelihoods, and the poor and vulnerable. The current systems used for NREM are \ninadequate  due  to  the  absence  of  a  comprehensive  policy  framework  and  a  consistent \nlegislative  and  regulatory  base,  as  well  as  weak  institutional,  planning,  and  enforcement \nsystems. A range of land resource management, and legal and institutional issues must be \naddressed to promote more efficient land allocation and use. \n  \n4.  The Government has indicated a commitment to developing an integrated approach to \nNREM  with  the  establishment  of  the  MENR  in  2001,  and  the  development  of  a  draft \nenvironmental policy. The Government is also preparing a national environmental action plan. \nFurthermore, projects supported by ADB2 and the Netherlands are helping the Government \nprepare a number of natural resource subsector policies and plans (forest, wildlife, water \nresources, biodiversity, and coastal resources). At the subsector level, progress has been made \nwith policy development and planning, drafting of new legislation, and institutional capacity \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in September 2002. \n2  ADB. 1992.

It is important that the subsector policies, strategies, and legislative and regulatory \napproaches  are  harmonized  and  integrated  across  the  subsectors  for  effective  overall \nmanagement of natural resources and the environment. \n \n5.  Some natural resource and environmental problems for example, water degradation due \nto  agricultural  and  industrial  pollution,  and  solid  waste  management  will  require  providing \nspecific services for treatment and mitigation. At the same time, a more comprehensive range of \nservices extending to livelihood improvement is likely to be required to address problems related \nto community-based management of natural resources and to maintain and develop ecologically \nsignificant sites used for both community livelihood and ecotourism. The provision of these \nservices is currently inadequate; it is often the responsibility of local government agencies that, \nunfortunately, lack the required institutional, human, and financial capacity. \n \n6.  The Government estimates that about 27% of the population in 1995 was in poverty; \nwith a larger group considered vulnerable as their household income level was only slightly \nabove the poverty thresholds. In Sri Lanka the levels of consumption poverty are significantly \nhigher than those of human poverty, indicating that poverty is linked more to income level than \nto access to basic services. As 90% of the poor live in rural areas and a significant percentage \nof  these  households  are  small  farmers,  the  management  of  natural  resources  and  the \nenvironment is a key factor influencing their poverty status, as degraded resource systems will \nlimit their ability to generate sufficient assets to move beyond poverty. Current population and \neconomic growth forecasts suggest that the overall demand for natural resources in Sri Lanka \nwill increase by approximately 50% above the existing level within 20 years. Given the high \nlevels of consumption poverty and the large group assessed as vulnerable, Sri Lanka faces a \ngrowing poverty risk if effective NREM systems are not established. The Government\u2019s poverty \nreduction  strategy  identifies  innovative  environmental  management  as  one  of  the  priority \nstrategies for poverty reduction (Appendix 1).3 \n \n7.  In 2000\u20132001, an ADB advisory technical assistance (ADTA) on sustainable natural \nresource  management,  achieved  a  number  of  outcomes  in  terms  of  advancing  policy \ndevelopment to improve land resource management, and in preparing recommendations for \ninstitutional and legal reform to improve natural resource management.4 The ADTA's outcome \nprovides the basis for developing an NREM framework. The ADTA recommended that further \nsupport be provided in three key areas: (i) strengthening institutional capacity for environmental \nand  natural  resource  management  at  national  and  provincial  levels,  and  for  sustainable \ndevelopment  planning;  (ii)  establishing  apex  agencies,  and  improving  land  resource \nmanagement, and forestry and biodiversity coordination; and (iii) reforming inconsistent or \noverlapping laws and regulations on the management of natural resources.   \n \n8.  On land  resource policy, the Government is preparing a new land ownership act to \nfacilitate the alienation and transfer of land. While this legislation will lead to efficient transfer of \nland, it will not resolve numerous land resource policy and legal issues that arise from the large \nnumber of agencies involved with land administration and associated overlapping functional \nmandates. The World Bank is considering expanding the existing Land Titling Project to include \nland resource policy and the related legal and ni stitutional aspects. The Government has \nprepared  a  national  involuntary  resettlement  policy  that  details  the  arrangements  for \ncompensation and rehabilitation. \n                                                 \n3  Government of Sri Lanka. 2002.

", "    3 \n9.  To develop an effective integrated NREM framework, the Government will need to \ncreate or strengthen management, planning, and regulatory systems, and institutional capacity \nat the national, regional, and local levels. These changes will be particularly important as part of \nthe rehabilitation process in the north and the east. The lack of consistent policy, institutional, \nand  legal  mandates  across  agencies  (national,  regional,  and  local),  and  the  partial \ndecentralization  and  devolution  of  natural  resource  and  environmental  management  and \nplanning functions have resulted in a lack of effective management, planning, implementation, \nand enforcement. \n \n10.  Although the devolution and decentralization process under the 13th Amendment to the \nConstitution is incomplete, the Government has established five regional ministries, with a \nmandate for physical planning, economic development, and coordination. The World Bank \nEnvironmental  Action  1  Project  is  supporting  the  Government  in  decentralizing  central \nenvironmental authority functions. However, more comprehensive support is justified since the \nGovernment has decided that local agencies will have the key responsibility for addressing both \nenvironmental and natural resource problems, and for providing services to mitigate such \nproblems. In the current fiscal environment, establishing of such services will require that local \nagencies find financing mechanisms that minimize direct Government financial cost. A range of \nfinancing  options  needs  to  be  assessed,  including  alternative  cost  recovery  mechanisms, \ncollection of resource rents, and public-private provision. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The Project Preparatory Technical Assistance (TA) will prepare a sector investment \nproject that will address priority natural resource and environmental problems in key subsectors. \nThe ensuing project will assist the Government to (i) establish a comprehensive, integrated \nNREM framework; (ii) implement priority investments; and (iii) develop efficient systems for \neffectively managing natural resources and the environment. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will involve a number of interdependent stages, which will form the basis for a \nsector investment project. They are (i) identification of priority natural resource and environment \nproblems at the subsector level; (ii) pilot case studies in 2\u20133 priority subsectors to determine the \nrequirements for developing efficient NREM systems (policy, legislative, institutional), and for \nproviding services that will be required to manage and mitigate specific problems and impacts; \n(iii) preparation of an NREM framework; and (iv) integration of the outcomes in stages (i)\u2013(iii) of \nthe TA into a sector investment project. \n \n13.  The TA will help the Government develop selection criteria to rank and prioritize natural \nresource and  environmental problems at the subsector level. Case studies in 2\u20133 priority \nsubsectors and representative pilot sites will identify the requirements for effective and efficient \nNREM, and for providing of services to manage and mitigate specific problems. At these pilot \nsites, the focus will be to develop management systems that detail institutional responsibility, \nmanagement needs, and supporting investment requirements. Where the site-specific problems \nrequire  the  provision  of  services  to  mitigate  or  manage  adverse  impacts,  such  as  water \npollution, solid waste management, and degradation of community-based natural resources, \nprotected areas, and ecologically significant sites, options for sustainable financing of such \nservices will be assessed. These case studies will be important in giving practical feedback from ", "4 \nthe field for the policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional requirements that will be used in \npreparing the NREM framework. Further, the case studies will identify the investment and \nimplementation  requirements  for  indicative  activities  in  those  subsectors,  a  key  input  in \npreparing the sector investment project. \n \n14.  Preparing an NREM framework will involve helping the Government review and assess \nthe  existing  management  systems;  the  policy,  legal,  and  institutional  structures;  and  the \nassociated social aspects. It will be particularly important to include all regions of the country. \nFrom this analysis, recommendations and an implementation manual will be prepared for \nGovernment endorsement to improve the management systems. In the subsectors where the \nproblems  and  impacts  will  require  provision  of  services,  the  options  for  financially  viable \nprovision of services will be assessed\u2013public-private provision, alternative approaches to cost \nrecovery, and requirements for effective public management and supervision of such services. \nAn operational manual will be prepared to help local government agencies select appropriate \nfinancing options and establish effective performance monitoring systems. The TA will support \nthe Government in preparing a draft natural resources policy, and the required supporting \npolicy, legal, and institutional reform agendas, including detailed time-bound action plans. The \nreform agendas will be implemented in the sector investment project.   \n \n15.  The sector investment project will be based on the outcomes of the TA activities, in \nparticular, (i) the identified requirements to implement an NREM framework, with the associated \npolicy, legal, and institutional reforms; (ii) the technical and operational capacity building needs; \nand (iii) the selection criteria for prioritizing subsectors that the project will support and the \ninvestment subprojects that will address priority natural resource and environment problems. \nThe pilot case studies and the feasibility studies will indicate the types of investment required. \nThe sector investment project will be prepared in standard ADB format, and the terms of \nreference in Appendix 2 detail these requirements.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,040,000 equivalent with a foreign exchange \ncost of $642,000 and a local currency cost of $398,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $800,000, comprising the entire foreign exchange cost and local \ncurrency cost of $158,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide the balance of \nthe  local  currency  costs,  equivalent  to  $240,000,  by  financing  $104,0005  to  pay  for  TA \nworkshops, vehicle hire, and 18 person-months of domestic consultant input (sociologist and \nsocial survey team), and in-kind contributions through provision of office facilities, staff, and \nservices. The ADB financing will cover all 22 person-months of international consultant and 40 \nof the 58 person-months of domestic consultant costs, international and local travel, reports and \ncommunications,  contract  administration  services,  office  equipment,  furniture,  and  office \nsupplies. Detailed cost estimates for the TA  are in Appendix 3. The Government has been \nadvised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n                                                 \n5  MENR will finance $104,000 directly, utilizing loan funds from the World Bank Environmental Action 1 Program. \nThe External Resources Department, Ministry of Policy Implementation, and the World Bank have been consulted \nand have concurred. ", "    5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be MENR. The active participation of a number of \nstakeholders will be required, as the TA will address issues that are linked with activities of other \nministries in the sector. To guide the TA, the Government will form an interministerial natural \nresource and environment advisory committee under the leadership of the secretary of MENR. \nThe committee will include representatives from all relevant stakeholders, including but not \nlimited  to  the  following:    the  Ministry  of  Lands,  regional  ministries,  Central  Environmental \nAuthority, Ministry of Home Affairs, provincial councils and local governments, Ministry of \nIrrigation and Water Resources, Ministry of Tourism, academia, nongovernment organizations, \nand the private sector. The committee will review and endorse recommendations on behalf of \nthe Government. \n \n18.  MENR and the relevant ministries will identify and ensure adequate participation of \ncounterpart staff to work directly with the consultants. Working groups will be established to \nsupport specific TA activities, such as the pilot case studies. These groups will be established \non a needs basis, and will be operational and technically focused. They will include relevant \nstakeholders and will be led by the key agency responsible for that activity.   \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over a 12-month period, starting in mid-February 2003 and \nending in January 2004.  The consultant team will prepare an inception report within 3 weeks of \nthe start of the TA, an interim report at the end of month 6; a midterm report at month 9; and a \ndraft final report that will include a detailed feasibility report 11 months after the start.  The \ninception, midterm, and draft final reports will be subject to tripartite reviews, which will involve \nADB, the Government, and the consulting firm.   \n \n20.  The  ADB-financed  consulting  services  will  be  provided  through  a  consulting  firm \nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants using the quality and \ncost-based  selection  method,  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging \ndomestic consultants. ADB\u2019s simplified technical proposal procedures will be applied. The \nGovernment will be responsible for recruiting the Government-financed consulting services, in \naccordance  with  ADB's  guidelines  or  other  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  for  recruiting \ndomestic  consultants.  The  TA  budget  provides  for  the  purchase  of  office  equipment  and \ncomputers. The consultants will procure those items in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Sri Lanka for the purpose of preparing the Delivering Natural Resource and \nEnvironmental Management Services Sector Project, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nSUMMARY INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national  Yes  Sector identified as a national  Yes  \npriority in country poverty analysis?  priority in country poverty  \n  partnership agreement? \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka: \nSri Lanka considers 27% of the population in 1995 to be in poverty, with a larger group of the population considered \nvulnerable as they fall slightly above current poverty thresholds.  Studies reveal that the levels of consumption poverty are \nsignificantly higher than those of human poverty, indicating that poverty is linked more to income levels than to access to \nbasic social services.  \n \nIn effect, the poor have less assets\u2013human, physical, and natural\u2013and those assets they do have attract lower returns \nwhen they interact with market and social opportunities to generate income. In Sri Lanka over 90% of the poor live in rural \nareas. Further, 42% of the poor are farmers with small plots of land of less than 0.4 hectare (ha), and the land is generally \nclassified as having low productive capacity.  With rising population, the current land per capita ratio will continue to fall \nfrom around 0.35 ha to 0.25 ha by 2030. Pressure will increase on households in terms of livelihoods, vulnerably, and \npoverty. One outcome is likely to be an increase in population living in urban environments.  \n \nThe country poverty strategy identifies the causes of poverty as  (i) lack of assets, especially land; (ii) imperfect property \nrights and miniature sizes of holdings; (iii) shortfalls in access to water;  (iv) weak institutional arrangements and practices; \n(v) noncompetitive product markets for farm produce; (vi) limited technology adoption and use in rural industries; (vii) poor \nproduction standards and low product quality in rural industries; (viii) high capital costs; (ix) raw material and resource \nbottlenecks; (x) limited access to production and marketing information; (xi) shortfalls in physical infrastructure, such as \ninadequate power, energy, and communications; and (xii) the absence of high mobility roads and a transport network \nlinking villages, towns, and cities. \n \nAccess to natural resources currently underpins the ability of many poor to escape from poverty.  Current forecasts of \ndemographic and economic growth suggest that the overall demand for natural resources within the Sri Lankan economy \nwill increase by approximately 50% above the existing level of resource demand within 20 years. Given the high level of \nconsumption poverty and the large group assessed as vulnerable, Sri Lanka faces a growing poverty risk if effective \nresource and environmental management systems are not established.   Without effective management, the outlook is one \nof declining natural resource productivity and environmental conditions, with an associated increase in vulnerability and \npoverty. \n \nThe Government's proposed poverty reduction strategy identifies seven priority areas: (i) achieving peace; (ii) maintaining a \nstable macroeconomic environment; (iii) improving market access by linking poor regions to dynamic markets; (iv) fostering \nproductivity improvement and broader market access for small- and medium-scale enterprises; (v) creating opportunities for \nthe poor to benefit from structural change by fostering broad-based rural development, competitive industrialization, service \nsector development, and sound urban settlement; (vi) improving access to quality education and health care; and (vii) \nenvironmental management to enhance the sustainability of the poverty reduction process. \n \nThe  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the  Government  program  to  address  poverty  by \nstrengthening natural resource and environmental management (NREM) systems, and developing effective delivery \nsystems for providing of these services. Support will involve institutional strengthening and developing appropriate \ngovernance systems. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Proposed Classification: Poverty intervention \nThe poverty analysis will include (i) a desk study of secondary data sources; (ii) a structured survey as an input for the \ninitial social analysis and the TA delivery process; (iii) follow-on, issue-based focus groups; (iv) a consultation process at \npilot sites with social impact evaluations to review the potential contribution to both poverty reduction and social well-\nbeing; and (v) an institutional assessment of community and nongovernment organization capacity.  \n \nThe desk study will review the existing data sets and reports on the social and poverty status of Sri Lanka and the effects \n(predicted and actual) of NREM systems.  The secondary data will be used to develop a regional and district- \ndisaggregated database that will be used for selecting pilot sites and for designing the social survey.  The social survey \nwill be undertaken at the household level and will use a stratified sample across the five regional administrations.  The \nsample will be stratified by district and local authority, poverty and social status.  Data will be collected to have \ndisaggregated data for gender, poverty (both consumption and human poverty), social status, and resource access \nparameters.  The potential for using the survey as an input to the next State of the Environment Report will be explored.  ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nIt is recommended that the survey, which will involve face-to-face interviews, be undertaken by experienced enumerators.  \nIssues identified during the analysis of survey data will be presented to the TA team, working groups, and advisory \ncommittees to develop an issue-based agenda for focus groups.  Focus groups will be implemented mostly in association \nwith the pilot sites, except for topics that require a wider stakeholder input, for example, community-based approaches \nand legal issues. The purpose of the focus group is to explore in greater depth stakeholder perceptions, preferences, and \nattitudes, and to integrate them into the implementation of pilot site programs and the definition of NREM systems and \nsupporting policy, legal, and institutional reforms.   \n \nThe social analysis will also review and assess the local nongovernment institutions in terms of their need for capacity \ndevelopment, the options for networking the agencies and the proposed programs, and the relationship of these groups \nwith local stakeholders, the natural resource and environmental planning process, and policy development. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder identification and involvement are critical components of the TA implementation strategy.  Stakeholders will \ninclude government agencies at the national, regional, and local levels, as well as nongovernment organizations, \ncommunity-based organizations, community members, and representatives of the private sector.  The TA will use a \nsteering committee, advisory committee, and working groups to build stakeholder involvement and ownership in decision \nmaking.  Further consultation will be essential, and a social communication program is included in the design to ensure \noutreach and awareness. Wide consultation programs are planned and will be followed up within the proposed loan \nprogram to achieve consensus on policy, legal, and institutional reforms and procedures.  The focus of the TA and \nsubsequent loan on natural resource and environment delivery systems will provide opportunities for involvement in \nplanning and decision making, as well as implementation\u2013where pro-poor strategies are to be developed.  \n \nParticipation strategy required:  The consultants will develop a participation strategy for both the TA and the follow-on \nloan.  The TA plan will be integrated with the social communication and pilot delivery site activities. \n \n \nD.

The project preparatory technical assistance (TA) will help the Government prepare a \nsector investment project that will address priority natural resource and environmental problems \nin key subsectors. To achieve that objective, the TA will support the Government in preparing a \ncomprehensive    integrated  natural  resource  and  environmental  management  (NREM) \nframework,  in  developing  efficient  systems,  and  in  defining  the  requirements  in  providing \nservices to effectively manage natural resources and the environment.  Selection criteria will be \nestablished to prioritize subsectors, and natural resource and environmental problems.  \n \nA.  Natural Resource and Environmental Management Case Studies \n2.  The TA will prepare case studies based on the identified priorities in 2\u20133 subsectors. \nRepresentative pilot sites will be selected, and used to identify and assess the requirements for \neffective and efficient NREM. At the pilot sites, the focus  will be to develop management \nsystems  that  detail  institutional  responsibility,  management  needs,  and  the  supporting \ninvestment requirements. Where the problem will require the provision of services to mitigate or \nmanage adverse impacts, options for financing such services through cost recovery, resource \nrents, and public-private provision will be assessed. The case studies will be important in \nproviding practical feedback on the policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional requirements that \nwill be used in preparing the NREM framework. Further, the case studies will identify the \ninvestment and implementation requirements for indicative activities in those subsectors, and \nthe information will be a key input in preparing the sector investment project. The consultant will \ncomplete the following tasks: \n \n(i)  Identify priority natural resource and environment problems and opportunities \nthrough desk studies, consultations, and a series of workshops at the regional \nand local authority levels, focusing on strategic problems and opportunities. \n(ii)  In consultation with the Government, agree on the selection criteria and priorities \nfor pilot case studies, and the site locations. \n(iii)  Establish working groups under the leadership of the responsible agency, to \nguide the pilot case studies. \n(iv)  Obtain consensus on a process for defining the roles, responsibilities, and rights \nthat will underpin the identification of management options and the development \nof implementation strategies. \n(v)  Undertake a participatory process for identifying of management strategies and \nassociated implementation plans. \n(vi)  Assess appropriate service delivery financing options and develop the required \ndocumentation for attracting finance. \n(vii)  Prepare a performance monitoring system that will allow assessment of the \nmanagement and system performance. \n(viii)  Prepare a brief summary of lessons learned in the case studies in terms of \npolicy, legal, and institutional requirements of implementation. \n \nB.  Natural Resource and Environmental Management Framework \n3.  The TA will help the Government review and assess existing management systems; \nenvironmental  and  physical  planning  processes;  policy,  legal,  and  institutional  structures; \nprovision of services; and associated social aspects. This assessment will cover all regions of \nthe  country.  From  this  analysis,  the  TA  will  prepare  recommendations\u2013for  government ", "Appendix 2  9 \nendorsement\u2013for developing a comprehensive NREM framework, and a draft natural resource \npolicy that gives in detail the required reform agendas and the requirements in providing \nservices to mitigate and manage priority problems. \n \n1.  Management Systems \n4.
