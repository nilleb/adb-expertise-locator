Economic growth in Asia and the Pacific has been impressive over the past 15 years, \nwith strongly positive impacts on poverty reduction. But it has come at an environmental cost. \nRising pollution in rapidly expanded urban areas and widening degradation of natural resource \nsystems threaten public health and undermine economic productivity.  \n \n2.    There is growing pressure within most countries of the region to alter economic patterns \nso  that  they  can  be  environmentally  sustainable,  but  the  investment  requirements  will  be \nenormous. Demand for infrastructure of all types is growing rapidly in the Asia-Pacific region, \nbut in recent years it has become clear that a significant portion of this investment will be \nneeded to address the widening environmental problems arising from rapid growth. Bottlenecks \nimposed by poor infrastructure are considered to be a significant constraint on future growth, \nespecially foreign investment.  \n \n3.    Public financing will be important as a catalyst but private capital will also be required to \nmeet investment demands. Public policy reform is needed to create the enabling conditions to \ninduce this investment and take advantage of energy opportunities. Economic, environmental, \nand  trade  policies  need  adjustment  to  set  priorities  for  targeted  public  investments  and \nencourage private financing. \n \n4.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) can play an important role in helping to meet these \nenvironmental investment needs. It can work with developing member countries (DMCs) to help \nthem devise appropriate policies\u2014based on different priorities and investment climates\u2014that \nwill  create  the  policy  and  institutional  conditions  conducive  to  investment.  ADB  also  can \nencourage enhanced regional cooperation to promote environmental sustainability while forming \npartnerships with governments and the private sector to make catalytic investments that lead by \nexample.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  for  the  technical  assistance1 (TA)  is  in \nAppendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.    Economic development and poverty alleviation in Asia and the Pacific are increasingly \nconstrained by deteriorating environmental quality and degradation of natural resources\u2014often \nas a direct negative side effect of the region\u2019s economic expansion. Although the situation \nvaries by country, this is leading to greatly increased demands on both public and private \ninstitutions to improve environmental quality, especially the need for expanded investment in \ninfrastructure  and  environmental  management  systems.  However,  the  breakneck  speed  of \neconomic growth in some developing countries has shown that environmental institutions are \nnot  nimble  enough  to  keep  pace  with  expanding  pollution  and  resource  degradation,  and \nenvironmental quality is in decline throughout much of the Asia-Pacific region. \n \n6.    Investments are needed to remediate the negative economic and environmental impacts \nof the past and ensure that future development is sustainable. Remediation investments needed \ninclude those to (i) clean up polluted rivers, (ii) control urban air pollution, (iii) deal with solid \nwaste  management,  (iv)  locate  and  mitigate  the  impacts  of  previously  disposed  toxic  and \nhazardous wastes, and (v) restore damaged ecosystems. Efforts also are called for to put \ndevelopment on a more sustainable path by (i) encouraging greater use of clean and renewable \nenergy  resources;  (ii)  providing  efficient  public  transport  systems;  (iii)  encouraging  energy \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 13 October 2005. \n ", "2   \nefficiency  and  sustainable  energy  use  patterns  by  consumers  and  businesses;  and \n(iv) establishing sustainable patterns of use for renewable resources such as forests, fisheries, \nand wetlands. In particular, increasing attention is being given to reducing waste, and reusing \nand recycling resources and products\u2014the so-called 3Rs\u2014as the basis of a  \u201csound material-\ncycle society\u201d or \u201ccircular economy\u201d in which both the consumption of natural resources and the \nenvironmental \u201cfootprint\u201d from economic activity are lowered. A regional senior officials meeting \non this subject is planned for March 2006, which will provide an opportunity for the TA to identify \nappropriate responses relating to environmental investment. \n \n7.    Several important opportunities appear to exist for promoting increased environmental \ninvestment. Particular attention needs to be paid to the adjustment of environmental policies, \nfinancing  arrangements,  and  trade  policies.  Environmental  policies  need  to  better  identify \npriorities  for  investment  and  work  with  public  investment  programs  to  justify  cleanup  and \nproactive expenditures. They also need to create incentives for complementary private capital \nflows into these areas. Financing opportunities can be realized through (i) removing of rigidities \nin the ability of municipalities to raise funds through bond markets or as borrowers in project \nfinancing;  and  (ii)  overcoming  constraints  on  information  flows  regarding  investment \nopportunities,  (iii)  addressing  weaknesses  in  domestic  capital  markets,  (iv)  reducing  legal \nrestrictions on private equity investment, or (v) forming of public-private partnerships. Asia is on \nthe cusp of capturing a significant portion of the global market for environmental goods and \nservices. Trade policy needs to facilitate this by including measures to ensure that companies \ncan  take  advantage  of  growing  \u201cgreen\u201d  markets,  including  the  free  interstate  flow  of \nenvironmentally beneficial goods and services. At the same time, country trade policies should \nnot use lower environmental standards as a basis for attracting foreign investment.  \n \n8.    The recently published Asian Environment Outlook 20052 suggests a range of positive \nenvironmental policy steps that governments can take to encourage increased private sector \nenvironmental performance and investment. Based on a growing body of experience, it shows \nthat governments can use a blend of market-based instruments and voluntary measures\u2014\nbacked by stronger enforcement of core environmental regulations\u2014to help shape a predictable \nand fair environmental policy regime in the spirit of public-private partnership. In other cases, \nsuch as state leadership through green procurement practices, public policy needs to lead the \nway through example. ADB and other development partners are supporting dialogue on these \nissues among the countries of the region at the regional and subregional levels, through forums \nsuch as the recently launched Asian Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Network \n(AECEN). \n \n9.    New financing opportunities to support environmental investments abound. While limited \nexperimentation with private investment has produced mixed results to date, the scope of \ndemand is clearly beyond the ability of governments alone to respond. Green investment funds, \nsuch  as  the  recently  created  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  Environment  Fund,  are \nbeginning  to  show  promise  on  a  relatively  small  scale,  but  the  experience  and  policy \nimplications should be used to promote expanded and refined investment instruments. Financial \ninstitutions  are  gradually  improving  their  understanding  of  environmental  investment \nopportunities and the environmental dimensions of all investments. In partnership with the \nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC), ADB will enhance its training of financial intermediaries \nto  help  them  better  evaluate  the  merits  of  and  returns  from  environmental  investments. \nOpportunities to capture benefits from reductions in greenhouse gas emissions through the \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2005.

Manila.  \n ", "  3\nclean development mechanism (CDM) and other carbon markets offer yet another innovative \napproach worth expanding. There also would appear to be significant scope for widening private \nequity investment in socially and environmentally proactive companies through the creation of \nsocially responsible investment (SRI) funds within the region. \n \n10.   ADB is an executing agency of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), which provides \ncofinancing for TA and investments that enable the realization of global environmental benefits. \nGEF seeks to employ innovative financing mechanisms to spur green investments through both \npublic and private projects. For example, GEF funds have been used to overcome financial, \ntechnical,  and  institutional  barriers  to  the  development  and  eventual  commercialization  of \ntechnologies in renewable energy and energy efficiency, where these lead to reductions in \ngreenhouse gas emissions.  \n \n11.   To  further  accelerate  economic  growth  and  alleviate  poverty  in  the  region,  many \ncountries are entering into bilateral and regional free trade agreements and promoting other \nforms  of  regional  economic  cooperation.  By  reducing  tariff  barriers,  countries  can  rely  on \ncomparative  advantage  to  compete  internationally  and  attract  foreign  investment.  The \nenvironmental behavior of firms\u2014especially those exporting to Europe and North America\u2014is \nbecoming an increasingly important part of consumer preferences and the trade policies of \nimporting countries. This has led to the expanded use of eco-labels, certification systems3 and \nother measures to demonstrate that international standards are being met. While not the only \nfactor, low regulatory costs can also enter into the decision-making equation regarding foreign \ninvestment. Regional economic integration should be constructed so that it triggers a \u201crace to \nthe  top\u201d,  where  companies  move  beyond  compliance  to  establish  their  environmental \ncredentials as a competitive marketing edge and see environmental goods and services as a \npotential growth industry. The alternative is for countries to compete with each other through \noffering the lowest environmental standards, resulting in a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d.  \n \n12.  The member countries of the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) \nhave  recently  committed  themselves  to  a  freer  trade  regime,  with  environmental  side \nagreements  pending.  In  East  Asia,  the  current  evolution  of  bilateral  and  regional  trade \nagreements is expected to culminate in the creation of an East-Asian Economic Community \n(EAEC) by 2020 at the latest. EAEC will likely comprise the PRC, Japan, Republic of Korea, and \nthe 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Both the SAARC \nand EAEC processes of economic integration should have at least five types of effects: (i) \nstructural\u2014change in the sectoral composition of the countries\u2019 economies; (ii) scale\u2014change \nin the overall level of economic activity; (iii) composition\u2014flow of products and services; (iv) \ntechnology\u2014transfer of environmentally-friendly technologies or possibly \u201cpollution havens\u201d; and \n(v) regulatory\u2014\u201clocking-in\u201d reform towards more market-friendly but stringent environmental \nregulation. These effects hold crucial implications for the environment, poverty alleviation, and \nsustainable development in the region and merit careful examination.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  that  governments,  the  private  sector  and/or  financial \ninstitutions of the region increase their investments in measures to improve environmental \n                                                 \n3 The International Standards Organization (ISO) 14001 certification system has become the most commonly applied \nand recognized environmental management system. \n ", "4   \nmanagement. The regional TA\u2019s outcome will be to enable interested governments, private \nsector groups, financial institutions and/or regional economic integration organizations to adopt \nenvironmental  policies  and  other  actions  to  take  advantage  of  opportunities  for  expanded \ninvestment in improved environmental management in Asia and the Pacific.4 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.   The TA is organized into three components, each responding to a key opportunity for \nincreased environmental investment in the region, relating to environmental policy, financing, \nand trade.  \n \n15.   Output 1. Environmental policy opportunities will be addressed by providing advisory \nsupport and capacity building to DMCs. Based on an assessment of DMC needs in this respect, \nspecific country-level or subnational policy reforms will be chosen as examples to demonstrate \nbenefits and best practices. Besides AECEN, other regional groupings and partners\u2014including \nthe Greater Mekong Subregion, Central Asian Regional Economic Cooperation mechanism, \nUnited Nations Centre for Regional Development, and United Nations Environment Program\u2014\nmay  also  be  engaged  in  the  development  of  environmental  policy  approaches  to  induce \ninvestment and serve as conduits for dissemination of recommendations. Environmental policy \nreforms to be promoted may include the (i) simplification of regulations regarding private sector \ninvestment in environmental infrastructure, (ii) expanded use of market-based instruments, and \n(iii) promotion of materials reduction. Wider application of voluntary measures leading to public-\nprivate  partnerships  also  will  be  encouraged,  potentially  including  the  (i)  organization  of \ninvestments  in  the  areas  of  waste  reduction,  reuse,  and  recycling  (3Rs);  (ii)  wastewater \nmanagement; (iii) clean and renewable energy; (iv) energy efficiency; (v) air pollution control; \n(vi) solid waste management; and (vii) sustainable urban transport. \n \n16.   Output  2.  The  TA  also  will  examine  new  financing  opportunities  to  increase \nenvironmental investment, including new sources of capital. Analysis of promising measures will \ncomplement parallel efforts in the areas of urban infrastructure, GEF, energy efficiency, CDM \nand other carbon market instruments. Efforts will be made to expand investor interest and to \nidentify ADB investment opportunities. In cooperation with ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations \nDepartment, consultations will be held with potential private investors to seek their views and \npossibly develop pilot projects or financial mechanisms demonstrating innovative approaches. \nThe TA will explore prospects for enhanced cofinancing of ADB investments from a variety of \nsources, including non-sovereign borrowers, bilateral donors, the private sector, and the GEF. \nThe  latter  offers  particular  opportunities  in  the  areas  of  clean  and  renewable  energy  and \nmanagement  of  hazardous  wastes.  In  consultation  with  ADB\u2019s  regional  and  private  sector \ndepartments, a selection of appropriate public and private sector projects in their early stages of \npreparation  will  be  chosen  as  pilots  for  development  and  application  of  recommended \napproaches to promoting increased environmental investment in the region. \n \n17.  Output  3.  With  respect  to  enhancing  trade  policy  opportunities  for  promoting \nenvironmental investment, the TA will primarily focus on the nascent EAEC as a model for \nregional economic integration and incorporation of environmental considerations into new trade \nregimes. A project on the Promotion of Sustainable Development in the Context of East Asia\u2019s \nRegional Economic Integration is being funded by the Government of Japan and implemented \nthrough the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) in cooperation with a range of \n                                                 \n4  No activity will be financed under the TA in a DMC unless the relevant government has given its no-objection to the \nparticipation of the DMC in this TA.  \n ", "  5\npartners.5 That project will examine country and regional policies in detail, using regional level \nquantitative and qualitative analysis and covering six countries: Japan, Republic of Korea, PRC, \nIndonesia, Thailand, and Viet Nam.6 The TA will work in partnership with IGES to draw other \ncountries into the dialogue on and analysis of these issues. \n \n18.  The findings of the TA will be summarized in a unified report integrating elements from \neach of the key components. A range of other written outputs outlining new policy approaches \nand partnership arrangements to promote environmental investment also will be produced. \nThese  will  be  developed  through  active  dialogue  with  partners  throughout  the  region  and \ndisseminated through these same networks. The TA also will provide recommendations to ADB \nfor enhancing its own operations in this area. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $400,000. The amount of $200,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program and $200,000 will be cofinanced by the \nGovernment of Finland and administered by ADB. The detailed cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  ADB will serve as the Executing Agency for the TA which will be implemented by its \nEnvironment and Social Safeguard Division. All consultants will be selected and recruited on an \nindividual basis by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the recruitment of domestic consultants. Equipment \nwill be purchased in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.7 A total of 8 person-\nmonths of international consultant support in the areas of policy, finance and trade will be \nrequired together with 15 person-months of domestic consultants. The consultants will submit \ninception reports, progress reports, and a draft final report suitable for subsequent publication in \nan integrated final TA report. The consultants\u2019 terms of reference are in Appendix 3. The TA will \ncommence in January 2006 and will be completed 18 months later.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Finland, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not \nexceeding the equivalent of $200,000 on a grant basis for Promoting Environmental Investment \nin Asia and the Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n5  Korea Environment Institute; National Institute for Environmental Studies; United Nations Environment Program-\nEconomics and Trade Branch, McGill University Canada; State Environmental Protection Agency, Policy Research \nCenter for Environment & Economy SEPA (PRC); Indonesian Institute of Sciences, Economic Research Center \n(Indonesia); Thailand Environment Institute; Institute for Environmental Science and Technology, Hanoi University \nof Technology (Vietnam); Keio University (Japan); Seiki University (Japan); Hiroshima University (Japan); United \nNations University; and the ASEAN Secretariat. \n6  The Government of Japan has committed the equivalent of $1 million for this activity, which will be implemented as \ncomplementary activities in parallel with the TA. \n7  Equipment to be purchased is limited to computer and communications devices, as necessary, with their disposal \nat the end of the TA to be handled in accordance with ADB guidelines. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets/  Data Sources/   Assumptions \nIndicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nGovernments, private  Measures of investment  Commissioned analysis  \u2022  Investment climate \nsector and/or financial  in environmental  by firm specializing in  remains robust in the \ninstitutions increase their  management show an  tracking changes in the  region, and the social \ninvestments for measures  increase   environmental goods and  and market pressures \nto improve environmental  services industry  on governments and \nmanagement in the    the private sector for \nregion   Data from OECD, World  improved \nTrade Organization, and  environmental \nAPEC   performance continue \n  to rise  \nNational statistics on \n \nenvironmental related  Risk \ninvestments   \u2022  Governments fail to \ntake positive \nmeasures to address \nthe environmental \nconsequences of \ngrowth and do not \ninvest in \nenvironmental \nimprovement \nOutcome      Assumption \nInterested governments,  Interested governments,  Consultants\u2019 progress  \u2022  General consensus \nprivate sector groups,  private sector groups or  reports, AECEN  reached by financial \nfinancial institutions,  financial institutions, and  meetings, and other  institutions, and \nand/or regional economic  regional economic  relevant forums  among regional \nintegration organizations  integration organizations  economic integration \nadopt environmental  have considered new  bodies, on the best \npolicies and/or other  environmental policies  approaches to \nactions of financing and  and/or other actions to  promoting \ntrade opportunities for the  address financing  environmental \npromotion of  constraints and trade  investment \nenvironmental  barriers \n \ninvestments  Risk \n\u2022  Governments, private \nsector/financial \ninstitutions, and \nregional economic \nintegration bodies do \nnot endorse \nrecommended \npolicies/remedies \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
