INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  2013  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide a policy \nand advisory technical assistance (TA) project to respond to policy and capacity building needs \nin priority areas of the 12th Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 and 13th Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020. In \nresponse to the request, ADB included a TA project in the 2014 nonlending program. A fact-\nfinding mission was fielded in August 2014 and an agreement was reached with the executing \nagency,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  on  TA  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, cost and financing plan, and outline terms of reference (TOR). 1 The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  After  30  years  of  rapid  growth,  the  PRC  has  become  the  world's  second-largest \neconomy. However, as reforms continue, the country needs to find new engines for growth. \nWith rising wages, a now declining labor force, and an aging population, growth will have to be \nincreasingly  driven  by  productivity  gains.  Moreover,  rapid  growth  has  created  structural \nproblems that need to be addressed, including economic imbalances, unbalanced rural and \nurban development, resource constraints, environmental degradation, and income inequality. \nThese  problems  have  been  accompanied  by  incomplete  reforms  and  limited  capacity  and \ninstitutional development.  \n \n3.  To encourage sustainable development, the Third Plenum of the 18th National Congress \nof  the  PRC\u2019s  Communist  Party  announced  its  \u201cDecision  on  Major  Issues  Regarding \nComprehensively Deepening Reform\u201d in November 2013. The decisions provide a blueprint for \nthe PRC\u2019s development in the next decade and beyond, encompassing the 12th and 13th five-\nyear plans. By 2020, the government aims to have achieved reform results by (i) allowing the \nmarket to play a decisive role in resource allocation; (ii) enabling the government to function in a \nservice-oriented and law-based manner; (iii) building a modern fiscal system that supports \ncentral  and  local  governments\u2019  initiatives;  (iv)  accelerating  reforms  for  social  security, \nemployment,  income  distribution,  education,  and  public  health;  and  (v)  establishing  a \ncomprehensive  system  that  protects  the  ecosystem  and  environment.  The  government \nrecognizes  the  need  to  tackle  structural  problems  that  constrain  balanced  economic \ndevelopment, equality, resources conservation, and ecosystem protection, and has decided to \naddress  key  development  issues  by  deepening  reforms  and  accelerating  capacity  building \nprogress. \n \n4.  Since  2003,  ADB  has  granted  six  \u201cfacility-type\u201d  TA  projects  to  the  PRC  for  the \ngovernment to meet emerging policy advisory and capacity development requirements.2  ADB \ndeveloped the \u201cfacility-type\u201d TA modality in partnership with the government as a flexible, quick-\nresponse mechanism where multiple subprojects aligned with the PRC\u2019s priorities and the ADB \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 November 2014.   \n2\n  ADB. 2003.

Manila (TA 7862, ongoing).  \n ", "2 \n \nstrategies are funded under a single TA. The government highly appreciated such TA projects, \nas they helped advance PRC\u2019s reforms and contributed significantly to the implementation of \nthe government\u2019s five-year plans. This TA is the seventh \u201cfacility-type\u201d TA project financed by \nADB in the PRC.   \n \n5.  According to the evaluation report by the ADB Independent Evaluation Department, \n\u201cfacility-type\u201d TA projects have had substantial impact on the development of the government\u2019s \nfive-year plans.3 The TA for the Fund for Strategic Policy Conferences and Studies for Poverty \nReduction contributed to the PRC\u2019s poverty reduction discourse. The TA for the Facility for \nReform Support and Capacity Building provided policy inputs  to the State Council directives for \nhandling  employment  and  entrepreneurship  development  issues  and  contributed  to  the \nestablishment  of  the  rural  di-bao  system  nationwide. 4  Some  subprojects\u2019  findings  and \nrecommendations have been incorporated into new regulations and law formulations in the PRC.  \nThe  evaluation  report  recommended  that  ADB  continue  to  work  with  \u201cfacility-type\u201d  TA, \nstrengthen  the  use  of  ADB  staff  and  international  consultants  for  providing  international \nperspectives, supervisory support, and peer review of locally produced studies.  \n \n6.  The objective of the TA is to support the government to deepen policy reforms and \naccelerate  capacity  building  in  areas  prioritized  in  the  PRC\u2019s  reform  agenda.  The  TA  is \nconsistent  with  the  strategic  pillar  of  inclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  growth, \nhighlighted  in  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015  and  aligned  with  the \nMidterm Review of Strategy 2020.5 The TA will provide policy recommendations and knowledge \nservices to promote the PRC\u2019s inclusive development and environmentally sustainable growth, \ndevelop government capacities at central and local levels, and increase ADB\u2019s policy impact \nand operational efficiency. The TA will support the implementation of the PRC\u2019s 12th and 13th \nfive-year plans and reinforce the PRC\u2013ADB partnership.  \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.   Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact of the TA will be deepened reforms and enhanced government capacities for \npromoting sustainable development. The outcome will be adoption by relevant government \nagencies of policy advice, regulations, new ideas, and best practices that are introduced or \nrecommended by the TA to deepen reforms and increase government capacity at central and \nlocal levels.          \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The TA will adopt the flexible mechanism effectively employed in previous TA projects to \nundertake strategic interventions in a timely manner. The mechanism allows for joint selection \n                                                \n3  Independent Evaluation Department. 2013. Performance Evaluation Report on Facility-Type Technical Assistance \nin the People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila: ADB. The report recommended that ADB continue to work with \u201cfacility-\ntype\u201d TA mode and replicate such engagement in other member countries to increase goodwill for the wider ADB \ncountry portfolio. \n4  This refers to the system established by the Government of the PRC to cover all rural areas and ensure a minimum \nliving standard for the destitute rural poor who lack productive capacities (e.g., childless elderly households, \ndisabled individuals, and female-headed households).    \n5  ADB. 2012.

The TA consists of two parts: component A for policy advice, and component B for \ncapacity building. The outputs will include (i) policy synopses and \u201cjust-in-time\u201d policy advice, \nand (ii) capacity-building activities.  \n \n10.  Component  A  for  policy  advice.  This  component  will  provide  central  and  local \ngovernments with sound policy advice on priority development issues, including (i) economic \nrestructuring;  (ii)  urban  and  rural  integration;  (iii)  resource  conservation  and  environment \nprotection;  and  (iv)  social  sector  and  welfare  development.  By  2015,  a  TA  mobilization \nworkshop will be organized. During the TA, some bilingual synopses and \u201cjust-in-time\u201dadvice \nthat provide the government with policy recommendations will be produced on selected studies \nrelating to the above mentioned four areas. Workshops to disseminate the studies\u2019 main results \nwill be conducted to enhance policy impact. A TA wrap-up workshop will be held in 2008.  \n \n11.  Component B for capacity building. This component will strengthen the capacity of \nselected central and local government agencies to implement the 12th and 13th five-year plans \nthrough capacity assessments, training programs, workshops, conferences, and knowledge \nmanagement interventions. Workshops and seminars with participation from government think \ntanks, decision makers, executing and implementing agency representatives, academia, and \ncivil society on introducing best practice, knowledge sharing, enhancing PRC\u2013ADB strategic TA \nprogramming  partnership,  and  training  for  executing  and  implementing  agencies  will  be \nconducted during TA implementation. By TA completion, capacity-building activities will help \nincrease the capacities of central and local governments and promote knowledge solutions in \nthe PRC.   \n \n12.  The subprojects of the TA will be jointly selected and endorsed by the executing agency \n(through the TA Division at MOF) and ADB (through the PRC Resident Mission country director) \nbased on mutually agreed selection criteria that will be reviewed during TA implementation. The \nsubprojects must (i) support government reform priorities and be consistent with the \u201cDecision \non Major Issues Regarding Comprehensively Deepening Reform\u201d and the country partnership \nstrategy, 2011\u20132015; (ii) promote the implementation of the 12th and 13th five-year plans; (iii) \nbe an urgent and high-priority issue for which ADB has expertise and available capacity to add \nvalue; and (iv) show evidence of strong PRC ownership.  \n \n13.  The  initial  subprojects  identified  under  the  TA  include:  (i)  Qinghai  low-carbon \ndevelopment  to  mitigate  climate  change  ($100,000);  (ii)  demonstration  of  integrated \nmanagement of forest and water resources in the Guanting reservoir watershed ($80,000); (iii) \necological restoration and protection of abandoned mines\u2014Xiangtan case study ($100,000); (iv) \nstudy  on  spatial  planning  system  models  ($80,000);  and  (v)  PRC\u2013ADB  strategic  TA \nprogramming workshop ($80,000). It is expected that MOF and ADB will identify and endorse \nadditional subprojects during TA implementation, using the criteria specified in para. 12. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1 million, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). A total of $500,000 is \nfor component A and $300,000 is for component B. The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff from the executing and implementing agencies; office \naccommodation; office supplies; data and information; daily coordination; logistics support for \n   ", "4 \n \nmissions, meetings and visits for TA implementation; and other in-kind contributions.   \n \n15.  Component  A  subprojects  may  also  fund  surveys,  field  investigations,  purchase  of \nrequired research materials, and other related expenditures on the basis of cost estimates \nagreed in advance by ADB. In line with standard ADB procedures, the TA will not support \nimplementing agencies' management fees or costs related to the use of implementing agencies' \nresources to be provided as part of the counterpart contribution. Component B subprojects may \ninclude  costs  related  to  workshop  venue,  equipment  rental,  translation  and  interpretation, \nmaterial  editing,  copying,  printing  and  dissemination,  food  and  nonalcoholic  beverages, \ntransportation, lodging, logistics and administrative support, and other expenditures related to \nTA implementation with prior ADB approval. The ceiling amount for each subproject is $100,000, \nor such other amount as may be mutually agreed by ADB (through the PRC Resident Mission \ncountry director) and the executing agency (through the TA Division at MOF).   \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  1  January  2015  to  31  December  2018.  As  the \nexecuting  agency,  MOF  (through  its  TA  Division)  will  be  responsible  for  oversight  and \ncoordination of subproject activities and TA quality. ADB and MOF will meet periodically to \nreview TA progress and update implementation status, with agreements via memorandums of \nunderstanding to be reached after each meeting. Agreements will include (i) a monitoring table \nupdating every component\u2019s implementation status for each TA subproject, (ii) an updated list of \nsubprojects involving ongoing and new inclusion, and (iii) a list of action items. A monitoring \nmechanism  will  be  established  by  the  PRC  Resident  Mission  to  track  the  subprojects\u2019 \nimplementation status under each component. ADB staff will supervise TA performance in \ncooperation  with  MOF, implementing  agencies,  and  other  relevant  parties.  Frequent  policy \ndialogue  and  communication  will  occur  between  ADB,  MOF,  implementing  agencies,  and \nstakeholders. ADB will evaluate outputs at every milestone and prepare a TA completion report.  \n \n17.  Throughout  implementation,  ADB  and  MOF  will  accept  subproject  proposals  from \ngovernment organizations, institutions, and nongovernment organizations. ADB and MOF will \njointly select subprojects on the basis of the TA design and agreed selection criteria specified in \npara. 12. Training will be provided to familiarize implementing agencies with ADB requirements \nand procedures, and share knowledge, as needed. The PRC Resident Mission will administer \nthe TA, with support from the ADB headquarters. During implementation, the PRC Resident \nMission country director will review and endorse individual proposals for TA inclusion (i.e., \nimpact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost and financing plan, and specific \nTORs). \n \n18.   ADB will recruit individual consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). A total of 40 person-months of individual \nconsulting services (10 person-months of international consultants, and 30 person-months of \nnational consultants) will be provided, including resource persons and task-specific experts. The \noutline TOR is in Appendix 3. TORs for individual subprojects will be developed in consultation \nwith  relevant  implementing  agencies  and  ADB\u2019s  Operations  Services  and  Financial \nManagement Department and approved by the PRC Resident Mission country director, as \nappropriate.  TA  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  line  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). ADB may establish an advance \npayment facility for MOF and the implementing agencies. \n \n \n ", "  5\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.
