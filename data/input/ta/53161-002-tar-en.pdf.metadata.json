THE ENSUING PROGRAM \n \n1.  The Government of Uzbekistan has requested policy-based loans totaling $200 million \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2019s ordinary capital resources to support demand and \nsupply measures that will broaden and deepen the country\u2019s financial system and ground it in a \nstrong legal and regulatory framework.1 The proposed Financial Markets Development Program \nwill facilitate an increase in the capacity and size of the financial markets (program outcome) and \nsupport the emergence of a well-functioning financial system that is able to sustain basic capital \nand investment needs as well as the country\u2019s longer-term economic objectives (in line with the \ncountry\u2019s Roadmap for Reforms, 2019\u20132021) (program impact).2  \n \n2.  The attached transaction technical assistance (TRTA) will support the diagnostic studies, \nthe policy dialogue with the government, and the preparation of the proposed program. The \nprogram and the TRTA will be included in the country operations business plan (2020\u20132022), \nscheduled for approval in the third quarter of 2019.  \n   \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Opportunity. The Government of Uzbekistan has accelerated its transition toward a \nmarket economy with the adoption of the Strategy on Actions for Further Development of \nUzbekistan (2017\u20132021) and the follow-on Roadmap of Reforms (2019\u20132021).3 Both documents \nrecognize the central role played by banks and capital markets in fostering this transition. The \nRoadmap of Reforms, in particular, tasks the government with modernizing and developing \nfinancial market infrastructure and services to better meet the needs of the real economy.4 The \nintroduction of market-based financial instruments will mobilize private sector financing to alleviate \nthe infrastructure deficit, lower the costs of financing business development needs, and enhance \naccess to finance. Commercially oriented lending and investment practices will boost capital \nallocation in the wake of the government\u2019s continued privatization efforts (also prioritized by the \nroad map) and help maintain high rates of economic growth as the state\u2019s economic contribution \nis gradually reduced. \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 gives priority to the development of the finance sector and capital \nmarkets to support the development of the private sector and enhance financial stability.5 Private \nsector investment is identified as a key driver of economic growth and a source of employment \n                                                \n1  The loans will be disbursed as single-tranche policy-based loans of $100 million each for subprograms 1 and 2. The \nindicative implementation periods are May 2019 to July 2020 for subprogram 1 and August 2020 to July 2022 for \nsubprogram 2. \n2  Presidential Decree No. UP-5614, dated 8 January 2019. \n3  Presidential Decree No. UP-4947, dated 7 February 2017; Presidential Decree No. UP-5614, dated 8 January 2019. \n4  The Government of Uzbekistan\u2019s issuance of $1 billion of Eurobonds on 13 February 2019 on the London Stock \nExchange shows investors\u2019 growing confidence in the country\u2019s economic fundamentals and its political will to carry \nout the reform program. It set a benchmark for corporate issuers and was preceded by the country\u2019s first sovereign \ncredit ratings by Standard and Poor\u2019s (BB-), Fitch (BB-), and Moody\u2019s (B1)\u2014as further indication of the country\u2019s \nefforts to appeal to a broader audience of (international) investors. \n5  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. Specifically, the proposed program will be aligned with the strategy\u2019s operational priority to strengthen \ngovernance and institutional capacity (i.e., supporting public management reforms and financial stability). \n \n ", "2 \ngeneration in the course of Uzbekistan\u2019s economic transition, and is a strategic area for ADB \nsupport, as outlined in the draft country partnership strategy for Uzbekistan (2019\u20132023).6 \n \n5.  Development problem. The economy is overly reliant on bank financing\u2014total bank \nassets account for 52.6% of gross domestic product as of the end of 2018.7 The banking system \nis highly concentrated, i.e., 77.5% of total bank assets are owned by the seven largest state-\nowned banks, of which the largest accounted for 26.3% of total assets.8 The banks also rely on \nfunding sources that expose them to interest rate and liquidity risks (maturity transformation risks, \nlargely from deposits of maturities up to 5 years) and government-directed lending programs at \nbelow-market rates\u2014crowding out market funding (and pricing) and narrowing access to credit \nlargely to state enterprises.9 Moreover, the funding structure of Uzbek banks has led them to \nadopt conservative lending practices, i.e., limiting the tenor of loans, and imposing high collateral \nrequirements and interest rates, which further restricts access to credit.10  \n \n6.  Domestic capital markets currently do not play a significant role in financial intermediation \nand resource mobilization in the Uzbek economy. The free float market capitalization of the \nTashkent Stock Exchange accounted for about 0.5% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product as \nof 31 March 2019,11 with daily trading liquidity of about $200,00012\u2014reflecting both the small scale \nand low trading liquidity of the exchange. Bond market development is equally constrained. \nIssuances in the primary market are dominated by government bonds, whereas corporate bond \nissuances are limited and costly. The government bond market is characterized by short-dated \nand infrequent issuances, and does not fulfill its role as a benchmark pricing reference; this \nrenders the pricing of securities difficult and corporate bonds less attractive to both issuers and \ninvestors.13 Only 0.33% of the total amount of corporate securities (i.e., shares and bonds) were \nissued as corporate bonds (totaling SUM198 billion or about $23.5 million) as of 1 March 2019.14 \nRegulatory barriers also restrict the issuance of corporate bonds\u2014e.g., a requirement that an \nissuer be a profitable joint stock company and a prohibition on issuing bonds in excess of a \ncompany\u2019s capital. On the demand side, major institutional investors are state-owned or state-\ncontrolled domestic banks. The participation of investors across the maturity spectrum is critical \nto support market development. \n \n7.  ADB  intervention.  ADB  proposes  to  provide  up  to  $200  million  to  support  the \ndevelopment of financial markets by introducing reform measures to diversify the predominantly \nbank-based system of financial intermediation. This will (i) expand the sources of credit and limit \nthe systemic impacts of economic shocks, (ii) reduce financing costs by stimulating healthy \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2019.

Manila. \n7  Central Bank of Uzbekistan Statistical Bulletin, 2018. \n8  As of 1 January 2019, 13 banks with state ownership controlled 84% of total bank assets, 89% of loans, and 81% of \ncapital in the banking system. (http://cbu.uz/en/statistics/bankstats/2019/01/158649/), last accessed on 13 May 2019. \n9  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) indicates that about 60% of credit is allocated at preferential terms. IMF. 20 \nNovember 2018. Uzbekistan: Staff Concluding Statement of an IMF Staff Visit. Washington, DC. A 2013 Business \nEnvironment Enterprise Performance Survey found that only about one-quarter of small and medium-sized \nenterprises have a bank loan, while 92% of working capital financing and 82% of fixed asset purchase financing \ncame from internal funds and retained earnings. ADB. 2019. Uzbekistan: Private Sector Assessment. Manila. \n10  The ratio of retail loans to gross domestic product stood at 5% by the end of 2017, indicating the weak penetration \nof credit, as per Fitch Ratings data. \n11 Capital Market Development Agency data. As of 29 March 2019, 132 companies were listed. \n12 Tashkent Stock Exchange and Silk Capital estimates. \n13  In December 2018, SUM600 billion in government securities were issued after a gap of 6 years (i.e., no government \nbonds had been issued since 2012). The issuances were in equal amounts of SUM200 billion across three tenors, \ni.e., 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years. \n14  Central Securities Depository data.  \n \n ", "3 \ncompetition with the banks, and (iii) boost the capital markets\u2019 contribution to meeting the \nincreasing financing  requirements  of a growing  economy. The  proposed  Financial  Markets \nDevelopment Program is scheduled to be submitted for ADB Board consideration in the second \nquarter of 2020. It was requested by the Government of Uzbekistan as a policy-based lending \nmodality to be disbursed over two subprograms. \n   \n8.  The TA will help the government prepare the design of its reform program and develop \nthe capacity to implement it.15 The reform program will serve to remove the binding constraints in \nthe development of the capital markets, i.e., (i) an opaque legal and regulatory framework with \noverlapping and contradictory mandates, (ii) ad hoc government debt management practices and \nabsence of a clear capital market development strategy for debt issuances, (iii) shallow and illiquid \ncorporate bond and equity markets, and (iv) inefficient (and costly) market trading platforms. The \nTA will also explore related issues to determine measures that would boost the participation of \ninstitutional  investors  in  Uzbekistan\u2019s  securities  markets,  and  lay  the  groundwork  for  the \nintroduction of alternative financing instruments (such as derivatives) as the financial markets \ndevelop. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n9.  The objective of the TA is to identify policy measures to support the development of a \nrobust financial market system in Uzbekistan that is well balanced, sustainable and resilient, and \nable to effectively intermediate savings to finance investments.  \n \n10.  Output 1: Securities market\u2019s legal and regulatory framework streamlined and \nconsolidated. This output will define measures to strengthen the legal and regulatory framework \nthat governs Uzbekistan\u2019s capital markets by (i) assessing the existing laws and regulations and \n(ii) proposing amendments with a view to removing undue complexity, broadening market access, \nand strengthening the legal rights of creditors and shareholders. It will also focus on setting \nsuitable supervisory policies; defining regulatory areas that need strengthening to achieve better \ntrading platforms and stronger market supervision; and identifying measures to strengthen the \nregulatory  capacity,  oversight  procedures,  and  enforcement  powers  of  the  Capital  Market \nDevelopment Agency (established in January 2019). Finally, it will further assess and recommend \nmeasures  to  align  the  financial  reporting,  auditing,  and  disclosure  requirements  for  listed \ncompanies  with  international  standards,  with  clear  directives  on  accuracy  and  a  periodic \ndisclosure regime; and to establish a reliable surveillance and enforcement system. These \nfindings will be presented and discussed with key stakeholders and will form the basis of policy \nactions to be implemented under the proposed program. \n \n11.  Output  2:  Long-term  national  capital  market  development  strategy  and \nimplementation plan formulated and implemented. The second output will focus on measures \nthat allow an extension of the government yield curve and thereby further enable corporate bond \nmarket development. It will analyze the impediments to and recommend a strategy for achieving \na deep, liquid, and transparent debt market with a wide range of products. It will also focus on \nmaking the pricing of primary corporate bond issuances more competitive, e.g., by promoting the \nrole of credit rating agencies and developing a national credit risk database and rating system. \nFinally,  it  will  assess  the  procedures  and  integration  of  existing  trading  systems,  and \nrecommended measures to improve the (cost) efficiency of market trading operations as well as \nthe regulatory, surveillance, and enforcement functions. On the demand side, the output will \nassess measures to strengthen contractual savings institutions and pension funds, and initiatives \n                                                \n15  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 April 2019. \n ", "4 \nto increase institutional investors\u2019 demand for corporate securities and participation in capital \nmarkets. The findings of dedicated technical studies will be presented and discussed with key \nstakeholders and reflected in the formulation of a long-term national capital market development \nstrategy and implementation plan in accordance with the priorities of Uzbekistan\u2019s key public and \nprivate sector stakeholders. The strategy will form the basis of policy actions to develop the \ngovernment and corporate bond markets under the proposed program. International and regional \nexperience in developing resilient and liquid equity and bond markets will be considered while \nformulating the strategy.  \n \n12.  The consulting team will organize and facilitate up to three strategic workshops with \nUzbekistan\u2019s key capital market stakeholders\u2014Ministry of Finance, Capital Market Development \nAgency, the central bank, and market participants\u2014to present and consult on the findings and \nrecommendations, and arrive at a consensus on the formulation of the final long-term national \ncapital market development strategy and policy actions to be implemented under the ADB \nprogram. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $525,000, of which $500,000 will be financed by the Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1.  \n \n14.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, inter-agency coordination, and other in-kind contributions. The government was \ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer and implement the TA with the support of its Uzbekistan Resident \nMission. The Public Management, Financial Sector and Trade Division of ADB\u2019s Central and West \nAsia Department will select, supervise, and evaluate the consultants.  \n \n16.
