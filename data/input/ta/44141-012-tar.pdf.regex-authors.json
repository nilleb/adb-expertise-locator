The sustainable management of forests and the protection of biological diversity are \nemphasized as part of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Strategy 2020.1 Consistent with \nStrategy 2020, in March 2013 ADB approved its Environment Operational Directions, 2013\u2013\n2020:  Promoting  Transitions  to  Green  Growth  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  (EOD).  The  EOD \nhighlights the need to address the ongoing degradation of natural ecosystems in the region and \npromotes  investments  in  \u201cnatural  capital\u201d  as  a  key  measure  to  help  developing  member \ncountries (DMCs) transition to environmentally sustainable growth.  \n \n2.  The technical assistance (TA) is designed to support the implementation of the EOD by \nassisting DMCs in developing knowledge and in building their capacity to undertake economic \nvaluation  of  ecosystem  services  and  to  integrate  these  values  into  strategic  planning  and \nproject-level decision-making processes. 2 The TA is also designed to address specific criteria of \nADB\u2019s Climate Change Fund, including support to maintain, restore, and enhance carbon-rich \nnatural ecosystems, while maximizing co-benefits for the conservation of biodiversity and the \ngeneration of other ecosystem services. The TA is in line with ADB\u2019s ongoing support for \nregional cooperation in the protection and sustainable management of large-scale ecosystems \nin areas such as the Coral Triangle, the Greater Mekong Subregion, and the Heart of Borneo. \nThe design and monitoring framework appears in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Natural ecosystems in Asia and the Pacific are among the richest and most diverse on \nearth.4 However, in the last 30 years, biodiversity in the region has declined by 64%\u2014twice the \nglobal average.5 Ecosystem goods and services flow from the region\u2019s stocks of \u201cnatural capital\u201d \nand are worth billions of dollars per year. The myriad of provisioning, regulating, and other \nservices  support,  among  others,  food  and  fiber  production,  clean  water  assurance,  soil \nprotection, climate regulation, and flood control. They also contribute to food, water, and energy \nsecurity, and climate resilience. This is particularly important for poor rural communities, which \noften rely directly on ecosystem services for their livelihoods and have less access to affordable \nsubstitutes.  \n \n4.  Few ecosystem services have explicit prices or are traded in open markets. As a result, \nmarkets  rarely  take  such  services  fully  into  account;  nor  are  they  reflected  adequately  in \nnational accounts and economic development planning. This contributes to their decline and \noften marginalizes the importance of natural capital in decision-making processes. Furthermore, \nlack of information and market failures have largely prevented the private sector from using \nmarket-based financial mechanisms to support ecosystem services to the full extent possible.   \n \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2  Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005. Ecosystems and Human Well-being: Synthesis. Washington, DC: Island \nPress. Ecosystem services refer to benefits people obtain from ecosystems, including (i) provisioning services, \nsuch as food and water; (ii) regulating services, such as regulation of floods, drought, land, and disease; (iii) \nsupporting services, such as soil formation and nutrient cycling; and (iv) cultural services, such as spiritual, \nreligious, recreational, and other nonmaterial benefits. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 20 November 2013. \n4  The region holds 20% of the world's biodiversity; 14% of the world's tropical forests; and 34% of global coral reefs, \nincluding the greatest number of marine species in the world.   \n5  ADB and WWF. 2012.

In  response,  there  is  growing  interest  from  DMCs  to  better  value  and  capture  the \neconomic benefits of ecosystem services. This is in line with commitments made under the \nConvention on Biological Diversity Strategic Plan for Biodiversity and Aichi Targets for 2010-\n2020, which aim to integrate biodiversity values into national and local development and poverty \nreduction strategies and planning processes by 2020. Although such approaches are not new, \nthe  momentum  in  favor  of  mainstreaming  economic  analysis  of  ecosystem  services  has \naccelerated in recent years, owing to factors such as new evidence on declining ecosystem \nservices and their effects on poverty, employment, incomes, and taxation revenues, and links \nwith apparatuses such as monetary and fiscal policies.6 In particular, this change has been \nstimulated by analytical studies such as the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and initiatives \nsuch as The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity, which have drawn greater attention \nfrom policymakers to the economic benefits of biodiversity. 7  \n \n6.  Despite this momentum, few DMCs have policies, regulations, or institutional capacities \nin place to systematically assess the economic values of ecosystems and integrate them in \nstrategic  planning  and  project-level  decision  making.  Furthermore,  there  are  significant \nopportunities to better use the outcomes of ecosystem service assessments to identify so called \n\u201cgreen economy\u201d opportunities, including the establishment of financing mechanisms to support \nbiodiversity conservation and sustainable livelihoods. These mechanisms include payment for \necosystem services (PES), forest carbon financing, direct user fees, offset mechanisms, and a \nrange of others in both the public and the private sectors.8    \n \n7.  ADB has helped support these approaches through capacity development, policy advice, \nand pilot projects on PES and reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation-\nplus (REDD+) in a number of DMCs. 9 In particular, lessons from the ADB TA for Capturing \nEconomic Benefits from Ecosystem Services show that better and more accessible information \nand improvements in the quantification of ecosystem services that have global significance \n(such as carbon and biodiversity) can help spur local and regional initiatives that provide local \nenvironmental improvements and livelihoods benefits. With better information, more coordinated \npolicies, and more efficient governance structures, private entities are also becoming more \nwilling to support the provision of ecosystem services through PES schemes.10 However, PES \nschemes in the region still need to demonstrate more explicitly the links between land use \npractices,  delivery  of  the  ecosystem  service,  and  socioeconomic  well-being.  Rigorous \nassessments of ecosystem service values provide a basis for making these links explicit, and \nsuch assessments are needed to build confidence and establish payment levels that reflect at \nleast  the  opportunity  cost  of  alternative  land  uses.  Government  policy  and  institutional \nframeworks may also be needed in many cases, to help mediate payments between buyers and \nsellers of ecosystem services across large geographic scales.    \n \n8.  The TA is designed to address these issues. It will support ADB\u2019s current work on \nclimate change. It will also support the protection and management of large-scale ecosystems \nby  building  knowledge,  partnerships,  and  capacity  for  the  assessments  and  valuation  of \necosystem services, and by strengthening strategic planning and project-level decision making.    \n \n                                                 \n6  P.

The impact of the TA will be better integration of ecosystem service values within the \nnational and subnational development planning processes in selected DMCs.11 The outcome \nwill be greater commitment of participating DMCs to integrating requirements for ecosystem \nservice assessment into policies and regulatory frameworks.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  TA  will  address  constraints  on  and  gaps  in  the  assessment  and  valuation  of \necosystem services as part of strategic planning and project development processes. Linked to \nthis  effort,  it  will  evaluate  \u201cgreen  economy\u201d  opportunities,  including  the  establishment  of \nsustainable conservation financing mechanisms such as PES. The TA activities will contribute \nto  three  main  outputs:  (i)  knowledge  shared  and  partnerships  strengthened  for  economic \nvaluation of ecosystem services; (ii) mapping and valuation performed for ecosystem services in \ncritical  landscapes  and  seascapes;  and  (iii)  pilot  activities  conducted  of  the  integration  of \necosystem service values and financing mechanisms into planning processes and projects. The \nTA will add value to regional cooperation programs and work with DMCs that participate in \nthese programs. 12 The TA will also focus on developing partnerships to support TA delivery and \nto strengthen knowledge networks and capacity in the region.    \n \n11.  Selection criteria for pilot activities will include the following: (i) degree of linkage with \nongoing and planned projects and initiatives; (ii) targeting of thematic gaps for ecosystem \nservice assessments; (iii) opportunities for scale-up and replication; (iii) countries or target areas \nwhere support has been limited; (iv) support for community benefits and poverty reduction; and \n(v)  opportunities  for  co-benefits  in  climate  change  mitigation,  adaptation,  and  biodiversity \nconservation. TA support will include technical advisory services by consultants; resources for \npublications, training, and knowledge-sharing workshops; and additional analytical studies.   \n \n12.  Output  1:  Knowledge  shared  and  partnerships  strengthened  for  economic \nvaluation of ecosystem services. The TA will review methods and tools for the assessment \nand economic valuation of ecosystem services and biodiversity, including climate regulation \nservices. It will also review case studies to assess gaps, barriers, constraints, and opportunities \nfor wider use of these methods and tools in the region.13 This work will be combined with a \nreview of experiences and good practices in establishing successful PES, REDD+, and other \nfinancial mechanisms and incentives in projects and initiatives conducted by ADB and others. \nMethodological considerations will include classifications, concepts, indicators or proxies, and \ndata sources required for the physical measurement of ecosystem services; and pricing and \nvaluation approaches suited to the information available and the data constraints in DMCs. \nThese reviews will provide the basis for the pilot activities under outputs 2 and 3.  \n                                                 \n11 The impact of the TA will not be limited to the participating pilot countries but will extend to other DMCs through \nregional knowledge sharing and the establishment of supportive partnerships.  \n12 These programs include (i) the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security (Indonesia, \nMalaysia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Solomon Islands, and Timor-Leste); (ii) the Greater Mekong \nSubregion Core Environment Program and Biodiversity Corridors Initiative (Cambodia, the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam); and (iii) the Heart of Borneo \nInitiative (Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, and Malaysia).   \n13 This review will include the ecosystem accounting guidelines of the United Nations Statistics Division: UN Statistics \nDivision. 2012. Draft Ecosystem Accounting Guidelines 2012. http://climate-l.iisd.org/news/un-statistics-division-\ndrafts-ecosystem-accounting-guidelines/ \n ", "4  \n13.  The  TA  will  support  knowledge  generation,  DMC  capacity  strengthening,  and  pilot \nactivities by strengthening partnerships and knowledge networks with key global, regional, and \nlocal  organizations,  including  academic  groups,  national  and  regional  organizations,  and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), as well as programs sponsored by other development \npartners. It will also promote and support south\u2013south knowledge exchange. This will include \nworking with regional cooperation programs such as the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, \nFisheries and Food Security, the Greater Mekong Subregion Core Environment Program and \nBiodiversity Corridors Initiative, and the Heart of Borneo Initiative. National capacity building and \ninstitutional strengthening will be linked to the pilot activities under outputs 2 and 3. Knowledge \ngenerated will be shared regionally with all DMCs through publications, training, workshops, and \nweb-based materials. Final knowledge products are expected to include (i) case studies and \npolicy briefs on ecosystem service valuation, conservation and carbon financing, and country \nmainstreaming approaches; and (ii) guidance notes and training modules on ecosystem service \nassessments, economic analysis, methodological tools, and data requirements.  \n \n14.  Output 2: Mapping and valuation performed for ecosystem services in critical \nlandscapes and seascapes. To build DMC capacity, the TA will demonstrate the process of \nassessing and valuing ecosystem services, including spatial mapping for at least three critical \nlandscapes  or  seascapes.  Data  will  be  collected  from  databases  on  biodiversity,  climate \nchange,  and  other  topics,  as  well  as  small-scale  surveys,  studies,  and  consultant  inputs. \nEconomic valuation will be undertaken for selected ecosystem components and services, and \nused to support strategic planning processes and economic analysis of projects under output 3. \nSupport for assessments will be provided on demand in two to three DMCs through close \ncooperation with ADB regional departments. Ideally, the assessments will link with ongoing or \nplanned projects, where additional resources for ecosystem service assessments can provide a \ncatalyst in establishing PES and REDD+ mechanisms, or will help improve policy, strategy, and \nplanning processes in DMCs.  \n \n15.  Output 3: Pilot activities conducted of the integration of ecosystem service values \nand financing mechanisms into projects and planning. Building on output 2, the TA will \nsupport the integration of ecosystem service values through pilot activities in two to three \nselected DMCs at three levels: (i) integration into the preparation of ADB country partnership \nstrategy, through links with country environment analysis and country environment notes and \nrelevant sector papers (one pilot activity to be selected from DMCs with strategy preparation \nscheduled in 2014\u20132015); (ii) integration within a national or subnational planning processes \n(one pilot activity); and (iii) integration in project-level feasibility studies and decision making, \nincluding project economic analysis (two pilot activities).  \n \n16.  To increase capacity and ownership, DMCs will participate in pilot activities. Focal point \nagencies, including ministries of environment, planning, and finance, will be selected on the \nbasis  of  their  role  and  mandate  to  support  further  mainstreaming  in  national  policies, \nregulations, and planning processes. These agencies will be the focus of institutional analysis.  \n \n17.  Each pilot activity will assess options for establishing financial mechanisms such as PES \nor REDD+. Through participatory planning processes, they will evaluate opportunity costs and \ngreen  growth  opportunities  within  the  given  strategic  planning  or  project  context.  Project \nassessments  will  be  undertaken  in  collaboration  with  ADB\u2019s  Economics  and  Research \nDepartment, with a view to drawing out lessons on integrating ecosystem service assessments \nin project-level economic analysis. DMCs will also receive initial support to develop action plans \nand road maps for scaling up ecosystem service assessment and valuation.   \n \n ", "  5\n18.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from January 2014 to December 2015.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000 and will be financed as a grant by the Climate \nChange Fund.14 DMC participation will be confirmed when the pilot activities are selected. It is \nexpected that participating DMCs will identify staff to participate and provide leadership and \nadministrative support in country assessments and capacity-building activities. ADB will not \nfinance any activity in any participating DMC unless the government of that country confirms it \nhas no objection. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan appear in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  ADB will be the executing agency, with the Environment and Safeguards Division of the \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department as the focal point. Output 1 of the TA will \nfocus on developing partnerships with regional organizations, academic institutions, and other \nNGOs to strengthen knowledge on ecosystem service assessment and valuation. Partnerships \nmay  also  be  developed  to  support  pilot  activity  implementation  under  outputs  2  and  3. \nPreliminary partnership discussions have been held with the Ecosystems Services Partnership, \nthe Sub-Global Assessment Network, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \nCenter for Biodiversity, and the World Wide Fund for Nature.  \n \n21.  Pilot activities under outputs 2 and 3 will be linked to current and planned projects \nsupported by ADB. Pilot activities will be proposed by regional departments. Identification of \npilot activities will be coordinated through ADB\u2019s adaptation and land use working group, which \nwill  serve  as  a  steering  committee  for  pilot  activity  approval.  DMC  engagement  will  be \ncoordinated through the selected projects. ADB\u2019s environment community of practice will serve \nas a knowledge hub for project communication and internal information dissemination.   \n \n22.  The TA will finance consulting services, workshops and training, and report preparation. \nConsulting services totaling 47 person-months (17 international and 30 national) will be required. \nADB will engage consultants in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time).  They  will  be  selected individually  in  response  to  specific \nrequests by regional departments during project implementation. The outline terms of reference \nfor  consultants  appear  in  Appendix  3.  All  disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time).  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis for \nPromoting Ecosystem Services and Forest Carbon Financing in Asia and the Pacific, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n14 Established by ADB. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nDesign  and Indicators with  Reporting \nSummary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nIncreased integration  By 2020, from 2013  DMC reports against the  Governments within the \nof ecosystem service  baseline:  UNCBD Aichi Targets  region are committed to \nvalues within national    on Biodiversity   addressing biodiversity loss, \nand subnational  At least three DMCs     ecosystem degradation, and \ndevelopment planning  apply policies or  Global Biodiversity  climate change. \nprocesses   regulations for  Outlook (UNEP)   \nintegrating ecosystem    Risk \nservice values into  Other relevant  Economic priorities or ad \nstrategic planning and  ecosystem and  hoc decision making \nprojects   biodiversity surveys and  override national \n  monitoring reports  commitments and priorities \nfor addressing biodiversity \nloss and climate change. \nOutcome      Assumption \nIncreased  By 2016:  DMC reports against the  Ecosystems provide \ncommitment of DMCs    UNCBD Aichi Targets  essential services that \nto integrating  At least three target  on Biodiversity   support human welfare. \nrequirements for  DMCs develop road      \necosystem service  maps or action plans  National and regional  Risks \nassessment within  for integrating  reports of DMCs  Economic values of \npolicies and regulatory  ecosystem services    ecosystem services in \nframeworks   valuation into strategic  TA reports  critical landscapes and \nplanning and project    seascapes are lower than \ndecision making   the opportunity cost of \n  development alternatives. \n \nConfidence in results of \neconomic assessment \nprocesses Is limited. \n \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.
