INTRODUCTION \n1.  The ongoing global financial crisis and the steep commodity price rise that hit markets in \nearly  to  mid-2008  have  adversely  affected  the  economic  performance  and  prospects  of \ndeveloping Asia. According to the Asian Development Outlook 2009, the regional slowdown is \nthreatening to increase the number of the absolute poor\u2014those who live on $1.25 or less \na day\u2014by more than 60 million people in 2009.1 In addition, high commodity prices can push \nmillions more in the region back below the poverty line. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nestimates that a 30% increase in food prices will raise the number of the poor by 9 million in the \nPhilippines and 22 million in Pakistan.2 This is because food composes at least 60% of the \nconsumption basket of the poorest segment of the region\u2019s population. Rising global commodity \nprices also threaten macroeconomic stability through spiraling inflation, greater fiscal burden of \nsubsidies, and possible exchange rate depreciation in commodity-importing countries. \n2.  The impact of the current turmoil on ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs) has \ncreated high demand for ADB\u2019s services\u2014both financial services and knowledge products. ADB \nplans to increase its lending by more than $10 billion in 2009\u20132010 is meant to address this \ndemand at least in part. ADB\u2019s assessments of the global economic environment and views on \nthe  region\u2019s  prospects  are  also  being  sought  more  and  more  often  by  borrowing  country \nauthorities and other development partners. ADB requires more up-to-date information and \neconomic  analysis  to  provide  such  assessments.  Moreover,  the  requests  go  beyond  the \nregional outlook to include ADB\u2019s views on global economic prospects and forecasts of key \nfinancial, energy, and commodity market movements. With ADB establishing a reputation as a \nknowledge institution, such requests for analysis are likely to continue beyond the horizon of the \ncurrent crisis. The Economics and Research Department (ERD) needs to step up its research \nand analysis to answer the heightened demand for knowledge products and services. \n3.  This research and development technical assistance (TA) project will seek to monitor \nfinancial, fuel, and food markets and study the implications of volatilities in these markets for the \nmacroeconomic and social development of the DMCs. It will undertake extensive research \nbased on high-frequency data of commodity and financial markets to improve understanding of \nthe underpinnings of such markets and of the factors influencing the volatility of prices. It will \nanalyze past and current trends, and use robust econometric models to predict the future \nmovements in these markets. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Finance, food, and fuel crises. Before the global financial crisis began in 2008, the \nworld economy had to deal with the difficulties brought about by a spike in fuel and food prices. \nCrude oil prices reached their peak of $147 per barrel in July 2008, at the height of the \ncommodity  price crisis, while wheat, maize, soybeans, and rice prices more than doubled \nbetween 2006 and 2008. International commodity price levels have not returned to pre-2007 \nlevels, and falling currencies in some countries are giving rise to a new round of price increases. \nThe food and fuel crisis may not be over and there are indications that prices could again rise \nsharply  in  2010.  In  addition,  natural  disasters  such  as  droughts,  floods,  typhoons,  and \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009. Asian Development Outlook 2009. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2008. Food Prices and Inflation in Developing Asia: Is Poverty Reduction Coming to an End? Special report. \nManila. \n3  The TA project first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 November 2009. \n ", "2   \nearthquakes cause supply-side shocks that can lead to food and fuel price increases. Aside \nfrom their inflationary effects, spiraling fuel and commodity prices can delay general economic \ndevelopment and hamper efforts to reduce poverty. Furthermore, a crisis that affects people\u2019s \nability to meet their basic needs is a serious threat to social cohesion and can lead to riots and \npolitical instability, as has been seen in diverse places such as Egypt and Haiti. The global \nfinancial crisis helped ease some of the inflationary pressures by reducing the demand for \ngoods, but it continued to hamper development and poverty reduction by stifling the DMCs\u2019 \nability to ensure continued economic growth.  \n5.  Sustainable growth. Some of the important reasons behind the food and fuel crisis of \nthe late 2000s are supply-side constraints. In particular, the prices of petroleum, wheat, maize, \nand rice skyrocketed partly because of concerns about the sufficiency of future supply and \nabout supply continuing to outstrip demand. What is more, climate change and global warming \nare thought to cause more and stronger typhoons, desertification, and seawater inundation, \nleading to loss of agricultural production and damage to crops and infrastructure. Measures to \nimprove food security and promote wider use of renewable energy sources thus need to be \nprioritized. In the short term, addressing these concerns requires a thorough analysis of the \nsupply  chain  and  logistics  to  determine  whether  prices  reflect  the  relative  scarcity  of  the \ncommodity and to discourage price speculation. In the long term, the sustainability of fuel and \nfood markets will need to be addressed, and prices may need to reflect the cost of investments \nin sustainable energy sources and food technology. \n6.  Social protection and aid. In response to the crisis in finance, food, and fuel markets, \ngovernments  in  many  countries\u2014both  developed  and  developing\u2014have  instituted  social \nprotection measures.  From  price  controls  in  the  Russian  Federation  to  unconditional  cash \ntransfers in the Philippines and export bans in India, such social protection measures are often \ncostly and distort the allocation of resources. As such, effective monitoring of the crisis is an \nessential tool for policy makers to determine if and when social protection measures may be \neased out. Likewise, donor countries need such information to determine how much and what \ntype of aid is needed by severely affected countries, and for how long. \n7.  Regional  cooperation  and  integration. Understanding the underpinnings of global \nfinancial and commodity markets can facilitate cooperation by exploiting differences between \nregional economies. Take, for example, the financial market. The regional economies are in \nvarying  degrees  of  financial  market  development.  Encouraging  cooperation  among  these \neconomies can facilitate the use of savings from surplus economies as investment in deficit \neconomies. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n8.  The Technical Assistance Strategic Forum 2008 identified major areas for research \nthrough ADB\u2019s research and development technical assistance program. For 2009\u20132011, the \nfive strategic priorities for research are (i) promoting inclusive growth, (ii) addressing climate \nchange  for  sustainable  development,  (iii) facilitating  knowledge  for  regional  integration, \n(iv) providing support to address the continuing increase in commodity prices, and (v) assessing \nand responding to demographic change. This TA project will squarely address priorities (iii) and \n(iv) of the forum by generating interregional knowledge products and monitoring prices in the \nfinancial,  energy,  and  commodity  markets.  It  will  also  deal  with  sustainable  development \nconcerns by looking at the climate change issues and natural disasters that cause supply-side ", "  3\nshocks and thereby affect prices. High-frequency data with market trend analysis can have \nimplications for social protection policies and aid exit strategies. \n9.  This TA project will help ADB develop its own capacity for research on finance, food, and \nfuel markets. While the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank both release regular \nupdates on commodity prices, these are available only monthly. More frequent price monitoring \nwill keep ADB researchers abreast of market developments that may affect DMC policy and \neconomic growth. \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The  impact  of  the  project  will  be  effective  policy  development  based  on  extensive \nresearch on finance, food, and fuel markets. Information is an essential input in policy-making \nespecially in the presence of market volatility and uncertainty. Governments need timely and \naccurate information coupled with rigorous analysis in order to know the current situation, adjust \nexpectations, and form policies to adjust to ever-changing realities. The project, by providing \nDMCs  with  this  information  and  analysis,  will  strengthen  the  links  between  research  and \npolicy-making and help raise the reputation of ADB as a producer of knowledge outputs not only \nrelated to Asia but related to the global economy as well.  \n11.  The  project\u2019s  expected  outcome  will  be  an  improved  understanding  of  the \nmacroeconomic and social impact of rising and volatile commodity prices and financial market \nuncertainties, and of the trends and issues underlying these markets. Knowing more about the \nmarket underpinnings of various commodities will equip ADB to provide better policy advice to \nits DMCs in terms of adapting to and mitigating the impact of commodity price volatilities, while \nthorough analysis of the financial markets can help ADB member countries institute proper \nmeasures to prepare for or even prevent another financial crisis. Moreover, the project will shed \nlight on the macroeconomic and social impact of natural disasters and other supply shocks as \nthey affect the prices of basic necessities and constrain access to credit. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The project will identify key financial market indicators and commodities in the global \neconomy, especially those that are of particular relevance to ADB\u2019s DMCs. Commodities that \nare heavily traded by ADB\u2019s DMCs will be included in the project. Key economic developments \nin  selected  industrial  countries  will  also  be  regularly  assessed:  in  particular,  economic \ndevelopments in the United States, the eurozone, and Japan will be closely watched, as these \ncountries are all relatively important for ADB\u2019s DMCs. These are also the economies that \nprovide  context  in  ERD\u2019s  annual  flagship  publication,  the  Asian  Development  Outlook. \nMoreover, the project will analyze the interactions between financial and commodities markets, \non one hand, and inflation, monetary and fiscal policies, and balance of payments on the other. \nEmphasis will be given to the impact of external shocks such as financial and economic crises \nand natural disasters on the availability of credit and the prices of commodities. Data to be \ngathered through the TA project will help develop ADB\u2019s capacity to conduct in-depth research \ninto these markets and quickly respond to DMCs\u2019 information needs in the event of market \nshocks.  \n13.  A technical workshop and a conference on these markets are proposed under this \nproject.  The  technical  workshop,  to  which  high-caliber  resource  persons,  economists,  and \nstatisticians will be invited, will define the research problems to be tackled, the specific prices \n ", "4   \nand market indicators to be monitored, the analytical framework to be used, and the study \nmethodology to be applied by the project. The conference, on the other hand, will include \nrepresentatives from government, the private sector, academe, and multilateral organizations. It \nwill take stock of the lessons and policies learned from the project, evaluate its performance, \nand chart the way forward.  \n14.  Analytical papers using the data that will be gathered are expected to be generated. \nThey  can  be  published  as  working  papers,  journal  articles,  or  policy  briefs.  Rigorous \neconometric methods and statistical techniques will be used in analyzing the data. Periodic \nprice indicator bulletins will be prepared for the financial markets and commodities covered by \nthis  project.  Initially,  the  list  of  indicators  may  include  interest  rates,  credit  default  swaps, \nsovereign risk spreads, and prices of crude oil, natural gas, rice, wheat, maize, soybeans, \nvegetable oils, sugar, and rubber. Relevant price benchmarks for these commodities will be \nselected from data available from ADB\u2019s current data subscriptions. In addition, a shipping price \nbenchmark, reflecting demand for bulk commodities, will be monitored.  \n15.  The high-frequency data and analysis on the finance, food, and fuel markets will be \nmade available to ADB staff, researchers, and policy makers through a one-stop website that \nwill be managed by ERD in cooperation with the Department of External Relations and the \nOffice of Information Systems and Technology. In parallel with the implementation of the TA \nproject, mechanisms will be put in place within the Office of the Chief Economist to ensure the \nsustainability  of  these  monitoring  activities  beyond  the  life  of  the  TA  project.  Information \ncollected under this TA will be used as inputs for possible Management briefings on issues \nrelated to the global economy. \n16.  The project will also publish periodic bulletins on financial markets indicators and food \nand fuel prices. The bulletins will contain summaries of the latest data available as well as \ntrends analysis based on econometric models to be developed by the sector economists. They \nwill be published on the project website and e-mailed to subscribers, who will include ADB staff \nand interested researchers. The frequency of these bulletins will be based on the availability of \nquality and disaggregated data. \n17.  In summary, the key outputs of the project will be (i) periodic financial, energy, and \ncommodity  price  monitors;  (ii) regular  macroeconomic  updates  on  industrial  countries; \n(iii) publications such as policy briefs and working papers; and (iv) a webpage that will house the \ninformation  generated  by  the  project.  These  outputs  are  all  designed  to  give  ADB  staff, \nresearchers, and policy makers the most up-to-date information on the finance, fuel, and food \nmarkets and robust analysis of these data that is easily accessible and convenient. The project \nactivities will be overseen by ERD.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013other sources). Details of the cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA project, which will be managed by ERD. \nThe project is expected to be carried over 24 months, from January 2010 to December 2011. ", "  5\nThe project will use technical inputs from ERD\u2019s three divisions. Given the broad scope of the \nproject, ranging from macroeconomic impact to social protection policies, and the breadth of the \ndata  required,  the  project  team  will  also  work  intensively  with  ADB\u2019s  other  knowledge \ndepartments\u2014i.e., the Office of Regional Economic Integration (OREI) and the Regional and \nSustainable  Development  Department  (RSDD)\u2014and  regional  departments.  While  OREI  is \ncurrently monitoring commodity prices, interest rates, and bond spreads, the monitoring is \nlimited  to  a  small  number  of  commodities,  and  to  selected  economies  in  East  Asia  and \nSoutheast  Asia.  This  TA  project  will  attempt  to  expand  the  coverage  of  countries  and \ncommodities, as well as broaden the scope of analysis in these markets. To maximize synergies \nand avoid duplication of efforts, the project team will work closely with OREI. For issues related \nto food security and renewable energy, ERD will coordinate with RSDD. In general, all outputs \nwill be subject to interdepartmental review and to external review during the workshops or \nconference. \n20.  The  TA  project  will  require  6  person-months  of  international  consulting  services, \n54 person-months  of  national  consulting  services,  and  1.5  person-months  of  international \nresource persons\u2019 services. National consultants will be citizens of the Philippines who will be \nbased at ADB headquarters in Manila. The consultants, to be hired as individual consultants, \nwill comprise sector economists, sector research analysts, and a project manager. ADB will hire \nthese consultants according to its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). ERD will provide coordination and administrative support. The terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. Disbursements under the TA will conform to \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook4. \n21.  The three sector economists\u2014one each for the finance, food, and fuel markets\u2014will \ndesign the research methodology, econometric models, and analytical templates that will be \nused in analyzing the data to be gathered under the project. They will also assist and train ADB \nstaff and the sector research analysts in using the analytical tools and knowledge that will be \ngenerated during the TA project. \n22.  The three sector research analysts\u2014one each for the finance, food, and fuel markets\u2014\nwill seek and gather data on these markets from all available resources, enter them into the \nproject  database,  and  do  data  analysis  based  on  the  templates  designed  by  the  sector \neconomists. A project manager will be hired to facilitate the implementation of the TA and \nmanage  the  project  website  in  cooperation  with  the  Office  of  Information  Systems  and \nTechnology. Resource persons will provide inputs to the work of the consultants, write detailed \ncomments on TA outputs, and serve as discussants during workshops and conferences. \n23.  Reports will be drafted by the project team and the international consultants. Periodic \nbulletins on the finance, food, and fuel markets will be generated by the project team using data \nand analysis provided by the sector research analysts and will be posted on the project website.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nMonitoring Finance, Food, and Fuel Markets for Development, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2008.
