INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  proposed  regional  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  help \nstrengthen  integrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM)  in  Afghanistan,  Bhutan,  and \nNepal.1 The TA will contribute to the management of environment and climate change impacts, \none of the strategic priorities in the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). It will do this by assisting target river basins in strengthening water resources \nmanagement to cope with (i) expected changes in water availability due to climate change, and \n(ii)  increase  in  water  demand  to  support  economic  and  population  growth.2 ADB\u2019s  Water \nOperational Plan, 2011\u20132020 prioritizes embedding the IWRM process in river basins.3 ADB \nhad two consultation and fact-finding missions in Bhutan and one consultation and fact-finding \nmission each in Afghanistan and Nepal.4 Governments\u2019 overall concurrence with the design and \nmonitoring framework\u2014including impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost \nestimate  and  financing  plan,  and  terms  of  reference\u2014were  made  during  the  fact-finding \nmissions. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Recent  population  growth,  economic  development,  and  urbanization  are  increasing \nwater, food, and energy demand in Asia and the Pacific region. With more than 75% of the \ncountries in the region lacking water security, the importance of water governance is increasing, \nand strengthening water resources management is becoming a pressing issue.5 Climate change \nwill affect temperature, rainfall, and cultivation patterns, which may add to the complexity and \nurgency of managing water resources. It will also increase the frequency and severity of water-\nrelated disasters. \n \n3.  The impact of climate change and competing demands for finite water resources require \nimproved water resources management that considers all water users within a river basin. In \nAsia, the Hindu\u2013Kush Himalaya (HKH) region is one of the areas that are most vulnerable and \nexposed to the impacts of climate change. As the source of major rivers\u2014including Amu Darya, \nGanges,  Indus,  Mekong,  and  Yangtze\u2014the  HKH  area  contains  the  world\u2019s  third-largest \nfreshwater reserve and provides water to almost 20% of the global population.6  \n \n4.   IWRM could be a suitable tool to achieve good water governance. It can be responsive \nto stakeholders\u2019 needs, future water demands, and the likely impacts of climate change. Many \ncountries in the region have already adopted national water policies that advocate IWRM in river \nbasins. \n \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the website of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \non 14 January 2016.  \n2  ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2011. Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020. Manila. \n4  In Afghanistan, a consultation mission was fielded in January 2015 and a fact-finding meeting in September 2015. \nIn Bhutan, consultation missions were fielded in May 2013 and September 2014 and a fact-finding mission in \nAugust 2015. In Nepal, a consultation mission was fielded in December 2014 and a fact-finding mission in \nSeptember 2015. \n5  ADB. 2013. Asian Water Development Outlook 2013: Measuring Water Security in Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n6  With an area of 3.4 million square kilometers, the HKH region covers Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan and has a population of about 1.5 billion. The \nworld\u2019s first- and second-largest freshwater reserves are in the polar regions. \n ", "2   \n5.  River basin organizations (RBOs) are crucial for IWRM implementation, which involves \nplanning and monitoring water use, tracking regulatory changes with stakeholder involvement, \nand preparing investments. ADB projects in the HKH area have supported initiatives to establish \nRBOs.7 Faced  with  basin  water  challenges,  countries  in  the  HKH  area  require  immediate \nsupport for institutional strengthening and capacity building to strengthen the performance of \nexisting RBOs in managing pressing water security challenges, and to form new RBOs, as \nappropriate. \n \n6.  The proposed TA will focus on HKH areas that rely on vulnerable water resources \n(glacial snow melt and precipitation). The target countries of the proposed TA (Afghanistan, \nBhutan,  and  Nepal)  were  identified  based  on  the  following:  (i)  geographical  location  and \nvulnerability to climate change; (ii) needs of counterpart agencies in supporting river basin \nplanning and institutional strengthening of RBOs; and (iii) strong linkage with ongoing or pipeline \nADB  projects  supporting  river  basin  management.  Target  river  basins  are  Panj-Amu \n(Afghanistan),  where  a  project  preparatory  TA  for  the  Panj-Amu  River  Basin  Project  is \nundertaken; Wangchhu (Bhutan), where the proposed TA will supplement efforts undertaken by \nthe Adapting to Climate Change through IWRM TA; and Bagmati (Nepal), where the proposed \nTA will be implemented in conjunction with the Bagmati River Basin Improvement Project.8 The \nproposed TA is expected to benefit 8 million people in the three basins. \n \n7.  IWRM is a key element of ADB\u2019s Water for All policy.9 The ADB Water Operational Plan, \n2011\u20132020 (footnote 3) reinforces IWRM. At the 3rd World Water Forum, ADB signed a letter of \nintent with the Water Resources Development Public Corporation of Japan (now the Japan \nWater Agency) and the ADB Institute to launch the Network of Asian River Basin Organizations \n(NARBO).10 NARBO has promoted the IWRM concept and has shared good practices of the \nIWRM approach in the Asia monsoon region for 10 years. ADB supported the establishment of \nan independent nonprofit network, the Asia-Pacific Water Forum (APWF), at the 4th World \nWater  Forum.11 Regional  cooperation  through  APWF  and  NARBO  could  support  IWRM \ninvestment programs and allow ADB to provide strategic assistance to its country programs. \n \n8.  From 2008 to 2014, ADB implemented a regional TA on managing water in Southeast \nAsia\u2019s river basins in collaboration with APWF and NARBO.12 The proposed TA will build on the \nrecommendations of the regional TA, including (i) further pilot implementation of a road map \nadvisory  service  in  other  river  basins;  and  (ii)  RBO  performance  benchmarking  can  be \nexpanded to more RBOs.13 The proposed TA will adapt lessons from previous activities in \nSoutheast Asia to South, Central and West Asia, where further IWRM efforts are needed. \n                                                \n7  Since 2000, more than 30 ADB projects have supported IWRM in the HKH region and its downstream riparian \ncountries. \n8  ADB. 2014.

APWF was officially launched on 27 September 2006 at \nthe ADB headquarters. A number of key institutions from the region have committed to support APWF as \u201clead \norganizations\u201d responsible for achieving progress under each priority theme and key result area. \n12 ADB. 2008.

The  TA  will  contribute  to  IWRM  implementation  in  selected  river  basins  through \nstrengthening of RBOs and capacity building of relevant staff. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n10.  The impacts will be: (i) by 2020, accelerated and expanded implementation of IWRM, \ndelivering improved water security and enhanced efficiency and productivity (footnote 3); and   \n(ii) by 2030, implement IWRM at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as \nappropriate.14 The outcome will be IWRM in target river basins sustainably implemented. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The outputs of the TA in target river basins will include (i) water resources institutions \nstrengthened; (ii) technical capacity of staff of water resources institutions in target river basins \nenhanced; and (iii) knowledge of and good practices for IWRM broadly disseminated in Asia \nand the Pacific region. \n \n12.  Output 1 will undertake activities for institutional strengthening of target RBOs and their \nrelevant agencies for improved IWRM for ADB projects, which are or will be implemented in the \nsame river basins. Joining a regional network of RBOs will provide sustainable benefits to \ngovernments and RBOs by providing external resources, such as technical advice and access \nto knowledge hubs. This will contribute to skills strengthening and experience acquiring for \ngovernments and RBOs. \n \n13.  In  Afghanistan,  activities  will  include  (i)  introducing  and  customizing  an  institutional \nframework for RBO performance benchmarking to the Panj-Amu River Basin Agency (RBA) as \nits performance monitoring procedure;15 and (ii) supporting the Ministry of Energy and Water \n(MEW) and the RBA to undertake their institutional mandates, such as the establishment of an \nadvisory board and river basin council at the RBA, and pilot implementation of a national \nirrigation program. \n \n14.  In Bhutan, activities will include (i) supporting the National Environment Commission \nSecretariat (NECS) and the Wangchhu River Basin Committee (RBC) and its secretariat with \nthe implementation of the river basin management plan developed under the preceding TA to \nBhutan (footnote 8); (ii) facilitating the formation and registration of water users associations \nwithin the Wangchhu river basin; (iii) supporting the NECS and the RBC and its secretariat to \ninstitutionalize the Bhutan Water Security Index within the government\u2019s 5-year planning cycle; \n(iv) expanding the database developed under the preceding TA (footnote 8) to maintain water \nresources data and information of water users associations in the Wangchhu river basin; and (v) \n                                                \n14 United Nations. Goal 6: Ensure access to water and sanitation for all. \n    http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/ \n15 RBO performance benchmarking was developed in ADB. 2006.

Technical \nAssistance for Managing Water in Asia\u2019s River Basins: Charting Progress and Facilitating Investment. Manila. The \nproposed TA seeks to extend the application of RBO performance benchmarking to newly established RBOs. \nPerformance benchmarking is a collection of reliable and useful practical indicators from various aspects to \nmeasure  RBO  performance.  By  undertaking  periodic  updates,  the  indicators  will  help  RBOs  monitor  their \nperformance in a sustainable manner to observe improvement and highlight weaknesses. \n ", "4   \nintroducing and customizing an institutional framework for RBO performance benchmarking to \nthe Wangchhu RBC. \n \n15.  In Nepal, activities will include (i) providing an external advisory service team consisting \nof experts from regional knowledge hubs and/or RBO practitioners to support the Water and \nEnergy Commission Secretariat, the High Powered Committee for the Integrated Development \nof the Bagmati Civilization (HPCIDBC), and the Bagmati RBO with the preparation of a river \nbasin  master  plan;  and  (ii)  introducing  and  customizing  an  institutional  framework  for \nperformance benchmarking of the Bagmati RBO. \n \n16.  Output 2 will provide individual technical capacity building training to relevant agencies \nto accelerate IWRM implementation. \n \n17.  In Afghanistan, activities will include (i) IWRM training for at least 30 government officers \nthrough capacity building programs, including geographic information systems mapping, and \nwater resources data management and allocation; and (ii) preparing an RBO human resources \ncapacity development action plan consistent with the national capacity development policy and \nstrategy for the water sector. \n \n18.  In Bhutan, activities  will include (i) training for at least 30 government officers and \nstakeholders in the implementation of IWRM and geographic information systems mapping; and \n(ii) supporting the Wangchhu RBC and its secretariat to prepare and implement its human \nresources capacity development plan. \n \n19.  In  Nepal,  activities  will  include  (i)  delivering  IWRM  training  for  at  least  30  water \nengineers, government officers, and stakeholders. This will include building their capacity to \nsustainably operate and maintain a decision support system developed under the Bagmati River \nBasin Improvement Project; (ii) improving water monitoring facilities for the decision support \nsystem; and (iii) preparing the RBO human resources capacity development plan to maintain \nthe capacity of the RBO and its operational staff to keep the required standard despite frequent \nhuman resources rotation. The target government agencies for the capacity building program \ninclude HPCIDBC, Water and Energy Commission Secretariat, Ministry of Irrigation, Department \nof Irrigation, Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, and Bagmati RBO. \n \n20.  Output 3 will prepare knowledge products based on TA outcomes and lessons, and will \nbe disseminated to target and developing member countries through regional workshops and \nconferences. One knowledge product will focus on the formulation of an RBO and consensus-\nmaking mechanism in mountainous river basins that are vulnerable to climate change and have \ndiverse  stakeholders. The  other knowledge  product  will  focus  on river  basin  planning  that \nintegrates climate change adaptation and disaster risk management. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The proposed TA is estimated to cost $2 million, which will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The cost estimates are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  ADB will execute the TA through the Water Sector Group Secretariat in the Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department in collaboration with the Central and West Asia \n ", "  5 \nand South Asia departments. The implementing agencies are the MEW in Afghanistan, the \nWater Resources Coordination Division of NECS in Bhutan, and the HPCIDBC in Nepal. \n \n23.  Implementation of the TA in the selected basins will involve staff from the concerned  \nwater  agencies,  other  government  agencies  and  stakeholders.  During  TA  implementation, \nmobilization of senior IWRM experts or RBO practitioners through regional networks such as \nNARBO and/or APWF will be considered as resources persons for knowledge sharing. \n \n24.  The TA will be implemented from May 2016 to April 2019. An outline of the terms of \nreference  for  consultants  is  in  Appendix  3.  ADB  will  engage  international  and  national \nconsultants through a consulting firm, following the quality- and cost-based selection method \nwith  a  quality-to-cost  ratio  of  90:10.  ADB  will  select  and  engage  the  consulting  firm  in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime).  An  output-based  contract  will  be  used  for  consulting  services.  Six  international \nconsultants will provide 32 person-months of service and seven national consultants will render \n127 person-months. All disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n25.  The TA consultants will submit (i) an inception report at the end of the third month \nfollowing mobilization; (ii) quarterly progress reports; (iii) an interim report at the end of the 18th \nmonth;  (iv)  a  draft  final  report  at  the  end  of  the  34th  month;  and  (v)  a  final  report  that \nincorporates comments by ADB, concerned RBOs, and other stakeholders. Meetings between \nADB and the consultants, and other concerned parties, will be held following report submission \nand as often as necessary. The TA\u2019s outputs will be posted on ADB\u2019s website. \n \n26.  In each target country, the implementing agency will provide counterpart support in the \nform of (i) documents, data, statistics, information, or maps; (ii) counterpart staff; (iii) assistance \nfor coordination with stakeholders and organizations; (iv) logistic assistance for workshops and \nseminars, including sending invitations to participants; and (v) other in-kind contributions. \n \n27.  The MEW in Afghanistan and HPCIDBC in Nepal will provide further counterpart support \nin the form of (i) office space for consultants; and (ii) quality control of consultants\u2019 outputs, \nincluding supervision of consultants\u2019 working hours. \n \nIV.
