INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA)1 to strengthen the legal and regulatory \nframework of social assistance in the PRC. A TA fact-finding mission, fielded on 9\u201312 July 2012 \nin  Beijing,  discussed  and  agreed  with  the  government  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  costs,  financial  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  for \nconsulting services of the proposed TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  A well-functioning social protection system, which ensures the provision of basic needs \nof vulnerable people, is a key factor in attaining inclusive development.3 A core feature of the \nsocial protection system is social assistance. Social assistance services are provided to target \nbeneficiaries  based  on existing  regulations  of the  PRC.  From  1998  when  the government \naccelerated the state-owned enterprise reforms, the PRC economy and society have undergone \nbroad changes, including transitions from a rural society to a more urbanized and industrialized \neconomy, and from a low-income to a middle-income but more unequal society. There has also \nbeen significant migration of rural residents to urban centers. These changes have put pressure \non the social protection system in the PRC to adjust. However, the regulatory framework for \nsocial  assistance  programs  has  remained  static  and  does  not  ensure  social  services  are \nsufficient or responsive.   \n  \n3.   Various social assistance programs are being implemented in the PRC, e.g., the urban \nand rural minimum living allowance,4 temporary relief,5 and the rural five guarantees.6 The \nrelevant  laws  and  regulations  for  those  social  assistance  programs  are  the  Notice  on \nEstablishing the Minimum Living Standard Guarantee for Urban Residence (State Council, \n1997), the Regulations on Urban Minimum Living Standard Guarantee (State Council, 1999), \n                                                \n1  The technical assistance (TA) is included in the Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, \n2012\u20132014. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 July 2012.  \n3  A social protection system focuses on social assistance and two other core factors: (i) social insurance, which \nmitigates risks associated with, among others, unemployment, ill-health, and work-related injuries; and (ii) labor-\nmarket-related issues such as promotion of employment and protection of workers (United Nations Research \nInstitute for Social Development. 2010. Combating Poverty and Inequality: Structural Change, Social Policy and \nPolitics. Geneva). \n4  The urban minimum living allowance program is for eligible urban residents with nonagricultural permanent \nresidence permits. The basic subsistence allowance is provided to those with a per capita income lower than the \nlocal urban residents\u2019 minimum living standard. The full minimum living allowance is provided to those urban \nresidents who have no source of income, no working ability, and no legal guardian to support them (Government of \nthe  PRC. 2004. The PRC White Paper. http://english.gov.cn/official/2005-07/28/content_18024.htm). After about \n10 years\u2019 experience in urban areas, the minimum living allowance program was introduced in rural areas in 2007. \nUnder the rural minimum living allowance program, subsidies, which vary in different areas depending on the \neconomic conditions of the areas, are provided for those whose incomes are below the basic living costs \n(Government  of  the  PRC.  2007.  More  Rural  Residents  to  Benefit  from  Basic  Living  Allowance  System. \nhttp://www.china.org.cn/english/government/221824.htm). \n5  Temporary relief supplements the minimum living allowance for families which have temporary difficulties or \nfamilies which need further assistance due to special reasons (Ministry of Civil Affairs. 2007. The Notice on Further \nEstablishing and Improving Temporary Assistance. Beijing). \n6  The program of rural five guarantees supports elderly rural people who have lost the ability to work, have no source \nof income, and no legal guardians to support them. The program provides elderly people with five guarantees, i.e., \nfood, clothing, housing, medical care, and burial expenses (Government of the PRC. 2004. The PRC White Paper. \nhttp://english.gov.cn/official/2005-07/28/content_18024.htm). \n ", "2 \n \nthe Notice on Establishing Minimum Living Standard Guarantee in Rural Areas (State Council, \n2007), the Notice on Further Establishing and Improving Temporary Assistance (Ministry of Civil \nAffairs, 2007), and the Regulations on the Work of Five Guarantees in Rural Areas (State \nCouncil, 2006). \n \n4.   There  are  a  number  of  problems  with  the  existing  social  assistance  programs:  (i) \noverlapping coverage and benefits for some portion of poverty population and gaps for others, \n(ii) insufficient level of benefits to help the poor rise out of poverty, and (iii) low quality and \ninsufficient provision of social housing support. Expanding the coverage of social assistance to \nthe marginal poor7  is also a critical issue in the PRC. Moreover, there is a large disparity in \nsocial assistance benefits provided to urban registered residents based on the hukou system8 \nversus rural residents, and migrant labors who have limited access to social assistance.  \n \n5.   To make social assistance effective in the PRC, the efficiency of targeting and the level \nof benefits need to be reassessed. Thus, there is a need to (i) review the legal framework that \ngoverns social assistance provision in the PRC, and (ii) formulate measures to strengthen the \nlegal structure to ensure adequate social assistance for all targeted populations in both urban \nand rural areas and for the migrant population.  \n \n6.  The PRC country partnership strategy, 2011\u201320159 identifies inclusive growth as one of \nthe three pillars to foster balanced and equitable development. The key to achieving inclusive \ngrowth is to build a social protection system that can provide the vulnerable population with \nequitable access to basic social assistance. \n \n7.   The purpose of the TA is to provide the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Standing \nCommittee of the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC) with recommendations for streamlining \nand strengthening the legal framework to ensure consistency of policies on social assistance \nprovision, focus on the scope of protection, and enhance the level of benefits. \n \n8.   ADB is supporting a number of TA projects related to the PRC social protection system: \n(i) the TA for Building Equitable Opportunities into Social Assistance aims to improve social \nassistance services delivery by ensuring equitable provision of benefits, access to services, and \ncapacities  to  deliver  such  services;10  (ii)  the  TA  for  Management  System  and  Legislative \nMechanism for Nonprofit Organizations focuses on developing a legal framework of nonprofit \norganizations  (NPOs),  including  charity  organizations,  industry  associations,  research \ninstitutions, and academic societies;11 (iii) the TA for Policy Study on Strategic Options for \nUrbanization assists the PRC in developing a national urban development strategy, including \naffordable housing in urban areas;12 and (iv) the TA for Performance Evaluation Model for the \n                                                \n7  The marginal poor are people whose income levels are low but just above the poverty line.  \n8  The hukou system officially identifies a person as a resident of an area, which hence segments the population into \nurban and rural. The social protection system in the PRC reflects the distinction between urban and rural \nregistration based on the hukou system. \n9   ADB. 2012.

The TA will build on the experiences and lessons learned from these ongoing ADB TAs, \nand focus on the legal framework regulating social assistance programs in the PRC. It is critical \nthat  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  is  streamlined  and  strengthened  to  improve  the \neffectiveness and efficiency of social assistance provision in the PRC. The TA will also aim to \nexamine and learn from international best practices on social assistance related legal and \nregulatory frameworks, including those covering social assistance programs provided by NPOs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The expected impact of the TA will be improved efficiency and effectiveness of social \nassistance,  including  social  housing  support.  The  achievement  of  this  impact  will  be \ndemonstrated through a 10% increase in the coverage ratio of the social assistance programs \nfor those below the poverty line by 2020. Improving the efficiency of targeting and the scope of \nprotection among the social assistance programs will bring about 10% increase in the coverage \nratio. The data of 2012 will be used as the baseline once the data is released in the last quarter \nof 2012. The expected outcome of the TA will be an improved legal and regulatory framework \nfor social assistance, ensuring equitable access of rural, urban, and migrant populations to \nbasic  social  assistance  services.  The  achievement  will  be  measured  by  the  adoption  of \nproposed recommendations on legal policies improving social assistance by 2016. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will deliver four major outputs:   \n(i)  analysis of the legal and regulatory framework of social assistance in the PRC, \n(ii)  introduction of international best practice on regulation of social assistance that \nensures equitable access of targeted beneficiaries to basic social assistance \nservices, \n(iii)  a policy note including recommendations for streamlining and strengthening the \nlegal and regulatory framework of social assistance in the PRC and international \nbest practice, and \n(iv)  improved  awareness  of  government  officials  and  other  stakeholders  of  legal \nreforms needed for more equitable and efficient provision of social assistance \nthrough knowledge products and services \n \n12.  To  complete  the  outputs,  the  following  steps  are  envisaged.  After  recruitment  of \nconsultants, the social assistance and welfare law expert consultant (who is also the team \nleader) will develop a detailed work plan in consultation with the Social Law Department of the \nLegislative Affairs Commission at the outset of the TA. The consultants will analyze the current \nstatus of social assistance in the PRC, covering the urban and rural minimum living allowance, \ntemporary relief, the rural five guarantees, and social housing support. The consultants will \nreview the legal and regulatory framework of those social assistance programs, and examine \nconsistencies  in  regulations  among  those  programs.  Better  coordination  of  NPOs\u2019  charity \nprograms with public social assistance is also necessary to improve the efficiency of social \n                                                \n13  ADB. 2012.

Thus, the consultants will also examine the issue of charity by NPOs \nwith a focus on consistencies in regulation of NPOs with public social assistance in the PRC.  \n \n13.  To  learn  from  international  practice,  the  consultant  team  will  analyze  international \npractice on social assistance in the form of comparative study of practice within the PRC and \ninternational best practice, and produce a policy note summarizing international best practice. \nBased on the analyses, the consultant team will formulate recommendations for streamlining \nand strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for social assistance in the PRC. The \nSocial Law Department of the Legislative Affairs Commission will provide the consultants with \nnecessary data and background information of current PRC regulations on social assistance \nprograms. The Social Law Department of the Legislative Affairs Commission will also provide \nthe  consultant  team  with  necessary  support  for  translation  of  background  information  into \nEnglish. \n \n14.  To observe best practices, one or two international study tours will be conducted. In \naddition, to enhance awareness of key issues, build consensus for the reform, and share the \ninformation, workshops and consultation with government officials and other stakeholders will \nbe conducted at various stages of project implementation. This will include an inception or \ninterim workshop and a draft final report workshop. All workshops are expected to be attended \nby an ADB mission, government officials, and specialists to ensure the inclusion of diverse \nviews and wide dissemination of project outputs. The executing agency will also ensure that all \nfinalized reports and recommendations are circulated to all relevant government officials.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000 of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013other sources). The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  local  office  accommodation,  data,  documents, \nappointments for consultants with relevant agencies and organizations, and other services for \nconsultants,  counterpart  staff,  logistics  including  costs  of  selected  translation  and  meeting \narrangements, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 27 months from 12 October 2012 to 11 December \n2014. The Legislative Affairs Commission of the NPC Standing Committee will be the executing \nagency for the TA. \n17.  The  TA  will  cover  remuneration,  travel,  and  per  diem  of  consultants,  as  well  as \nworkshops,  seminars,  study  tours,  and  miscellaneous  expenses.  ADB  will  establish  an \nadvanced  payment facility  with  the executing agency to  administer  the  activities  related to \nworkshops and study tours, subject to the executing agency\u2019s capacity to complete the activity \nand liquidate the advance. Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n18.  There will be five individually recruited consultants: one international social assistance \nand welfare law specialist, as the team leader for 6 person-months, one international NPO and \ncharity  organization  specialist  for  2  person-months,  one  national  social  assistance  legal \nspecialist for 4 person-months, one national NPO and charitable organization specialist for 2 \nperson-months, and one national social sector economist for 1.5 person-months. All consultants \n ", "5 \n \nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guideline on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). Outline terms of reference are attached as Appendix 3, with \ndeliverables linked to the design and monitoring framework. All reports by the consultants will be \nprepared and provided in both English and Chinese. The consultants will maintain close working \nrelations with the executing agency and will regularly discuss project progress and findings.  \n \n19.  The executing agency will supervise the day-to-day work of the consultants and take \nresponsibility  for  administering  consultation  with  stakeholders,  seminars,  workshops,  and \ninternational  study  tours.  ADB  will  assist  the  executing  agency  in  overall  TA  operations, \nmonitoring, facilitating international study tours, and disseminating knowledge results.  \n \n20.  The project-specific indicators and targets in the design and monitoring framework will \nbe monitored by the executing agency with ADB support. Policy dialogue will be maintained with \nthe government, and project-specific issues will be taken up with government counterparts \nduring review missions. Technical milestones will be monitored by reports to be prepared by the \nconsultants and reviewed by the executing agency and the project officer.  \n \n21.   The  knowledge  products  include  policy  notes  summarizing  recommendations  for \nstreamlining and strengthening the legal and regulatory framework of social assistance in the \nPRC and international best practice. The knowledge products will be disseminated through \nseminars, workshops, and other forms such as announcements in government bulletins. These \nactivities will be supplemented by media dissemination activities. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of China for  Streamlining Legal  and  Regulatory \nFramework for Social Assistance, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Reporting \nIndicators with Baselines  Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved efficiency  A 10% increase in the  National statistics, such  Smooth and efficient  \nand effectiveness of  coverage ratio of social  as social relief,  coordination among  \nsocial assistance  assistance programs, i.e.,  preferential treatment,  central and subnational \nprograms including  the minimum living  and resettlement from  governments, and with \nsocial housing support  allowance, temporary  the China Statistical  subnational offices, in \n  relief, and the rural five  Yearbook   implementing proposed \nguarantees, to people    reforms \nbelow the poverty line by   \n2020   Sufficient fiscal support \n  provided to implement \nThe baseline for the  Country and sector  recommendations  \nindicator: the number of  reports   \npeople receiving social  Risk \n \nassistance programs is \nLower tiers of \n88,475,000 in 2010 and \ngovernment do not have \nthe number of people \nenough capacity to \nbelow the poverty line is \ndeliver the improved \n128,000,000 in 2011 (the \nservices \ncoverage percentage is \n \n69.1%).
