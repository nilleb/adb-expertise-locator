INTRODUCTION \n1.  Promoting pro-poor growth and enhancing human and social development of the poor \nrequires affordable and reliable access to infrastructure facilities and services. The need for \nincreased investments in infrastructure, particularly those for regional connectivity that help \ncountries  to  reach  regional  and  international  markets,  and  for  making  infrastructure \nmanagement and maintenance more effective for the poor is widely recognized. \n \n2.  Adequate investment in infrastructure is crucial to promoting further growth of the Asia-\nPacific region, spreading the fruit of economic developments and raising the living standards of \npeople in the region. Given the region\u2019s huge infrastructure needs, mobilizing private sector \ninvestments  is  important.  Governments  have  a  key  role  to  play  in  promoting  an  enabling \nenvironment for private investment. Making this right will enable the region\u2019s vast savings to be \nefficiently channeled to fund its own investment needs, thus helping the region to realize its full \ngrowth potential and lifting millions out of poverty. \n \n3.  Public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) have the potential for the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  to  provide  leverage  and  thought  leadership.  Under  its  Public\u2013Private  Partnership \nOperational Plan, ADB addresses PPP development holistically across four pillars: (i) advocacy, \n(ii) enabling environment, (iii) project development, and (iv) project financing. Under pillars 1 and \n2, ADB is helping its developing member countries (DMCs) develop PPP policy and institutional \nframeworks  and  providing  PPP  project-related  support.  Accordingly,  ADB  is  in  the  unique \nposition to help advance its DMCs\u2019 knowledge on PPPs, apply recognized PPP principles and \nprocesses, and realize more PPP projects.  \n \n4.  The  regional  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (R-CDTA  or  TA)  will  help \ndeveloping countries better prepare infrastructure projects, particularly for projects that promote \nregional or sub-regional connectivity, that can secure private sector financing and proceed to \nimplementation. The TA will support government implementing agencies during the preparatory \ndue diligence stage to enable them to identify and prepare infrastructure projects that would \nqualify to access funding from international or national project preparation facilities1 for further \npreparation and structuring as PPP. The TA will target developing countries in Asia and the \nPacific, with priority to Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies. The TA first \nappeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on April 29, 2015. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  The Asia and Pacific region requires infrastructure investment of at least $8 trillion until \n2020.  Traditional  sources  of  infrastructure  finance  are  strained.  Public  budgets  are \noverstretched,  with  little  room  for  additional  spending  on  infrastructure.  Debt  markets  are \nretreating as banks, particularly those in Europe, which used to play a leading role in structured \nfinance, are still recovering from the global financial crisis and adjusting to tighter regulatory \nrequirements, including Basle III. Multilateral development banks (MDBs), including the World \n                                                \n1  The G-20 report on project preparation facilities (PPF) defined it to include entities whose main activity is project \npreparation and formal sources of finance such as trust funds that are used to prepare projects. PPFs may be \ncountry specific or regional, can have a range of institutional arrangements and cover both publicly and privately \nfinanced public infrastructure. In practice, some PPFs are involved in only some project preparation activities and \nmany PPFs undertake other activities in addition to project preparation. For the purpose of this TA, PPFs will only \nmean those facilities that support preparation of PPP projects such as ADB\u2019s Asia Pacific Project Preparation \nFacility. \n ", "2   \nBank and ADB, will have limited capital to fill the gap. Overseas development assistance has \nplayed  a  relatively  modest  role,  having  provided  only  2.5-3%  of  total  investments  in \ninfrastructure. Developing country capital markets lack the depth and breadth to provide the kind \nof long-term financing required for infrastructure. The bleak outlook for traditional financing \nmeans that governments must consider alternative financing models to leverage private capital. \n \n6.  With developing countries in the region facing a huge shortfall in investments and its \nnegative  consequences  on  economic  growth,  measures  are  urgently  needed  to  meet  the \nadditional funding requirements. Countries have three principal options: (i) review traditional \nsources of funds and explore additional funding from them; (ii) investigate mechanisms for \ngenerating more resources from off-budget sources; and (iii) consider a greater role for PPPs as \na way to procure infrastructure, and identify and address impediments to the development of \nPPP  transactions.  But  while  the  advantages  of  PPPs  have  long  been  recognized,  many \ncountries are still experiencing difficulties in its implementation.  \n \n7.  According to Preqin (a well-known research and consultancy firm that provides data on \nprivate  equity,  real  estate,  hedge  funds  and  infrastructure  funds  and  other  alternative \ninvestments),  over  $200  billion  of  capital  has  been  raised  globally  by  private  equity  fund \nmanagers for strategies dedicated to infrastructure investments. The bulk of capital in these \nfunds  is  from  long-term  investors  such  as  pension  funds  and  life-insurance  companies. \nInfrastructure  investments  generally  provide  asset-liability  matching,  stable,  inflation-linked \nreturns, and a relatively lower risk profile compared to equities. \n \n8.   A  dearth  of  well-structured,  viable  investment  opportunities  remains  the  common \nexplanation for the fact that a significant amount of capital in these funds remains uninvested. \nThere is no lack of private-sector capital or commercial debt available to finance well-prepared \nprojects with a later stage risk profile. The real problem is that the cycle that sees infrastructure \nprojects become infrastructure assets has a gap in terms of adequacy and quality of investment \npreparation  and  early-stage  investment  and  development.  Hence,  the  increasing  need  to \nmobilize and better coordinate project preparation resources to develop bankable PPP projects. \n \n9.  The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in its roadmap for supporting PPPs2 \nrecognized that PPP projects need to be well-prepared and structured before they are brought \nto the market. Adequate due-diligence and preparation of technical, legal, financial, economic, \nenvironmental and social issues are necessary for government to assess trade-offs and select \nan  optimal  structure  for  the  transaction  that  is  attractive  to  potential  private  investors.  To \nimprove  project  readiness,  it  is  useful  for  governments  to  develop  a  checklist  and  an \nadministrative system that could indicate whether a project is ready to be brought out to the \nmarket. Management capacity in the government, particularly in contracting agencies, needs to \nbe further developed to more effectively and efficiently bring projects forward to completion. For \nmarkets at an early stage of development, delivering a few good examples of successful PPP \nprojects  within  a  reasonable  time,  rather  than  focusing  on  quantity  of  projects,  is  a  most \neffective strategy for attracting investors. \n \n10.    At the Development Roundtable on Project Preparation hosted by ADB\u2019s Sustainable \nInfrastructure Division of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department  in Manila in \nDecember 2013, attendees from the African Development Bank, Inter-american Development \nBank, World  Bank  Group,  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  and  ADB \nagreed  to  partner  with  the  Sustainable  Infrastructure  Foundation  (SIF)  of  Switzerland  to \n                                                \n2 http://www.apec.org/Meeting-Papers/Ministerial-Statements/Finance/2014_finance/annexa.aspx \n ", "  3 \ncollaborate and take a pilot initiative that had started with ADB\u2019s R-CDTA 7379 and make it \nglobal and scaled.  The initiative, the International Infrastructure Support System (IISS), is now \nan IT platform providing public sector agencies sector-specific infrastructure project preparation \ntemplates  in  a  secure,  multi-user  standardized  online  workspace.  The  Public-Private \nInfrastructure  Advisory  Facility  (PPIAF)  has  provided  grant  support  to  SIF.  MDB  partners \nprovide inputs and strategic oversight through SIF\u2019s Advisory Committee and also support for \nIISS training and use.  As a web-based workspace and tool, IISS\u2019 design also integrates \nknowledge products from MDBs, such as the PPP Reference Guide, into the project preparation \ntemplates used by DMCs and their advisors or consultants, when preparing projects.  The IISS \nenables DMCs to better manage their project teams and make better use of the significant \nknowledge products that the MDBs have developed. \n \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  impact  will  be  increased  supply  of  commercially  viable  infrastructure  projects, \nparticularly those for regional connectivity, through PPP approaches. The overall outcome will \nbe  an  increased  capacity  of  developing  countries  to  prepare,  structure,  negotiate,  and \nimplement PPP projects. This will be measured by the number of ADB DMCs successfully \napplying for PPP assistance for the development of PPP projects. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.   The TA will provide capacity development support to DMCs that will be selected for \nassistance under this TA to enable them to apply for and capably secure funding from project \npreparation facilities. The support provided under this TA will not be subject to cost recovery.  \nTo achieve its outcome, the TA will deliver two outputs: (i) strengthened capacity of government \nimplementing agencies to undertake earliest-stage evaluation, prioritization and development of \npotentially viable PPP projects, and (ii) increased use of International Infrastructure Support \nSystem platform3 for project preparation. \n \n13.  The TA will have two components. \n \n(i)  Component  1:  Provide  support  for  diagnostics  application  to  project \npreparation  facilities.  The  TA  will  support  the  DMC  government  implementing \ngovernment  agencies  in  various  aspects  of  PPP  development  such  as  project \nappraisal, risk assessment and risk sharing, bidding process, legal implications of \nPPP contracts, monitoring and management of project implementation. The criteria \nfor choosing projects to be supported by the TA will be established in accordance \nwith the ADB PPP Operational Plan and the relevant country partnership strategy. \nProjects with regional cooperation and integration components in APEC developing \neconomies will be given priority. Lessons learned during project preparation will be \ncompiled and regional and subregional knowledge sharing events will be design to \ndisseminate these findings. \n \n                                                \n3  ADB developed International Infrastructure Support System as an innovative web-based secure and collaborative \nglobal  project  preparation  platform  to  help  provide  best  practices  through  sector/sub-sector-based  project \npreparation templates (accessed through a secure multi-user online platform). \n ", "4   \n(ii) Component  2:  Provide  project  preparation  support  through  the  use  of \nInternational Infrastructure Support System Platform. The TA will support DMC \ngovernment implementing agencies in using the International Infrastructure Support \nSystem (IISS) platform to preparing their projects to help increase the agencies\u2019 \nlikelihood  of  developing  well-structured  projects  that  will  attract  private  sector \ninvestors and contractors and increase public sector financing options, including \nPPPs. \n \n14.   The assumptions and risks for this TA can be grouped into two related categories. The \ncategory of risk is whether DMCs attach sufficient high priority to PPPs. There is an increasing \nacknowledgement of the added value PPP can bring to bridge the infrastructure gap. The main \nrisk for TA success is whether DMCs are willing to follow through to make PPPs happen and \nare prepared to initiate a comprehensive restructuring of laws, policies and frameworks. The \nsecond category of assumptions and risks relates to institutional and organizational capacity in \nparticipating DMCs. The TA aims to build capacity but will only possible if there is sufficient \nwillingness to adjust institutional structures, mandates and budget to support the shift needed to \nmake PPPs successful. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  Regional  Cooperation  and  Poverty  Reduction  Fund  and \nadministered  by  ADB.  Participating  DMC  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart staff, office space, land transportation and other in-kind contributions. Details of the \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. The support provided under this TA will not \nbe subject to cost recovery. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB, through the OPPP, will be the executing agency of the TA and will be responsible \nfor overall management and monitoring of activities. OPPP will coordinate activities with ADB \nregional  departments  (through the  PPP  Focals)  and resident  missions.  Confirmation  of no \nobjection will be obtained from DMCs before any activities financed by the TA commence in \nDMCs.  \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months commencing 1 July 2015 and ending 1 \nAugust 2017. It will require 3 international consultants and 2 national consultants on intermittent \nbasis for the duration of the regional TA. Consultants will be recruited individually using quality- \nand cost-based selection. Consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)4.  All  TA  proceeds  will  be \ndisbursed in accordance with the ADB Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (May \n2010, as amended from time to time). An overview of the consultant terms of reference is \nprovided in Appendix 3. \n \n18.   The TA consultant team will regularly document TA progress, challenges encountered, \nand solutions proposed over the implementation period. Updates on TA progress and outcomes \nwill be provided to ADB\u2019s PPP Thematic Group for further dissemination within ADB. \n   \n                                                \n4 Output-based (lump sum) contracts will be considered when hiring consultants. \n ", "  5 \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n19.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction \nFund for Infrastructure Public\u2013Private Partnership Pipeline Development Support, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n   \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance  Data   \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nIncreased supply of  Increased number of  PPP Unit/MOF data  Growing commitment in \ncommercially viable  infrastructure project  and project pipeline,  DMCs to tap private sector \ninfrastructure projects in  with private sector  websites tracking PPP  capital and expertise for \nDMCs  investment (average  development in the  infrastructure projects \nnumber of projects with  region  through PPP approaches \nprivate sector     \ninvestment for the last 3  Risk \nyears \u2013 2012-2014)   \n      Lack of political will to \nimplement infrastructure \nprojects using PPP \nscheme \n \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nCapacity of developing  Increased numbers of  PPP Unit/MOF data  DMC governments \ncountries to prepare,  PPP projects in pipeline  and project pipeline,  committed to applying the \nstructure, negotiate, and  by 2017   websites tracking PPP  knowledge gained from \nimplement PPP projects    development in the  the capacity development \nis increased    region  programs  \n     \n    Risk \n   \n  Increased numbers of    Inadequate institutional \nPPP projects  and organizational \nsuccessfully brought to a  capacity to effect \nclose from the pipeline  necessary changes in \nby 2017  project preparation policies \n \nOutput      Assumption \n       \n1.
