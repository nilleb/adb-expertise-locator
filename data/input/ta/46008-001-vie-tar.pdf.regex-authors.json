INTRODUCTION \n1.  In its new socioeconomic development plan, 2011\u20132015 the Government of Viet Nam \nrecognizes regional cooperation and integration (RCI) as an important policy area in Viet Nam\u2019s \nfurther development. RCI is identified as one of the five core operational areas in the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Strategy 2020,1 which commits to increasing public and private sector \noperations at the regional and subregional levels to at least 30% of its total activities by 2020. \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132015 for Viet Nam also considers RCI as one of its \npriority  thematic  issues.2 Hence,  the  government  strongly  requested  ADB  to  continue  its \nassistance  in  strengthening  Viet  Nam\u2019s  capacity  to  deal  with  RCI  issues,  particularly  in \ninvestment planning for RCI projects and programs so that Viet Nam can further benefit from \nand  contribute  to  RCI  initiatives.  The  scope,  expected  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  and \nimplementation arrangements were discussed and finalized during the technical assistance (TA) \nfact-finding mission conducted on 5\u201319 April 2012. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In Viet Nam, the coordination of RCI initiatives is particularly complex because of the \nlarge number of RCI initiatives involved,4 and the different dimensions of coordination required \nfor each of them.5 There is no single agency supervising all RCI initiatives, and the Ministry of \nPlanning and Investment (MPI) and Ministry of Foreign Affairs are mandated to serve as the \nnational focal points for different RCI initiatives; RCI coordination is fragmented between the two \nministries. There is no formal and functioning mechanism that looks at the totality of Viet Nam\u2019s \nparticipation across these initiatives, sets a strategic direction to effectively position Viet Nam in \ndifferent regional groupings, and determines national priorities across the initiatives to avoid \noverlap. Also, no standard operational procedures are in place for RCI coordination. The MPI is \nthe lead agency in coordinating the planning of public investments, including those for RCI \nactivities.  However,  national  and  subnational  governments  lack  an  effective  coordination \nmechanism and staff capacity and knowledge of RCI planning, and this weakens investment \nefficiency. \n \n3.  There is also no solid coordination mechanism between central and provincial authorities. \nCentral ministries provide budget and directives to their respective provincial units, which will \nthen report on the progress of their tasks to the central ministries. Although informed on key \nactivities, the provincial people\u2019s committees and units associated with other central ministries \nmay not always be involved in this decision-making and reporting process. This mechanism \ndoes not encourage active interaction between local authorities and provincial units of central \nministries, which increases the risk of isolating policy decisions from the reality on the ground. \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Viet Nam, 2012\u20132015. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 November 2012. \n4  Initiatives include (i) Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)\u2013Mekong Basin Development Cooperation, \n(ii)  Cambodia\u2013Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic\u2013Myanmar\u2013Viet  Nam  Cooperation,  (iii)  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion (GMS), (iv) West\u2013East Corridor, (v) Triangle Development, (vi) Two Corridors One Belt, (vii) ASEAN, \n(viii) ASEAN+3 and ASEAN+1, (ix) Ayeyawady\u2013Chao Phraya\u2013Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy, (x) East\u2013\nWest  Economic  Corridor,  (xi)  Asia\u2013Pacific  Economic  Cooperation,  and  (xii)  the  Mekong  River  Commission \nProgram. \n5  Includes  (i)  intraministerial  coordination  involving  different  departments  within  a  ministry,  (ii)  interministerial \ncoordination among various ministries, (iii) coordination between central line ministries and provincial authorities, \nand (iv) coordination between national focal agencies and region-wide institutions. \n ", "2   \nInadequate RCI coordination within the government also affects the efficiency of Viet Nam\u2019s \nnational focal point for each of the RCI initiatives and their working relationships with their \nsecretariats, such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Secretariat based in \nJakarta (Indonesia) and the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Secretariat in ADB headquarters \nin Manila. \n \n4.  Staff involved in planning RCI activities generally lack skills and knowledge critical for \ntheir responsibilities, i.e., skills for general public investment planning and specific knowledge of \nplanning RCI activities. Limited capacity is particularly evident at the provincial level. Apart from \nthe mismatch of skills and work requirements,  the awareness of  provincial staff of global, \nregional, and national development issues, as well as the benefit of RCI, is generally low. Poor \ncoordination and information dissemination from the central to provincial agencies contributes \ngreatly to the human resource capacity weaknesses at the provincial level. This has been \ninhibiting provincial staff from participating effectively in planning RCI activities. \n \n5.  The absence of an effective coordination mechanism and the lack of staff skills and \nknowledge  for  planning  RCI  activities  limit  the  possibility  of  seeking  complementarity  and \nsynergy between and among RCI programs and projects. This affects the achievement of \nintended  results  and  substantial  development  impact.  If  Viet  Nam  is  to  successfully  be \nintegrated into the ASEAN Economic Community (to be realized by 2015) and implement the \nGMS new Strategic Framework, 2012\u20132022 (approved at the Fourth GMS Summit in December \n2011), it is essential for the country to improve the efficiency of RCI coordination and investment \nplanning, particularly given Viet Nam's significant demand for infrastructure improvement and \nsocial services. \n \n6.  ADB has helped Viet Nam strengthen its RCI coordination through the TA for Capacity \nStrengthening of Viet Nam\u2019s Regional Coordination and Public Investment Planning6 with an \ninitial set up for a standard RCI coordination mechanism and a needs assessment on capacity \nbuilding to improve the skills of government officials to manage relevant activities. However, \nafter project completion, progress in these areas stalled and the recommended coordination \nmechanism and training program were not fully adopted. There were two main reasons for this \nshortfall. First, the commitment of the MPI\u2019s former senior management was weak, and the \ngovernment had not provided clear guidance on RCI strategies suitable for the country\u2019s new \ndevelopment  stage.  In  addition,  necessary  revisions  to  the  existing  institutional  and \norganizational arrangements within the government were politically difficult before the Eleventh \nNational Congress of the Communist Party of Viet Nam7 was held in January 2011. Second, \nadequate  financial  and  human  resources  were  not  provided  to  institutionalize  TA \nrecommendations.  The  situation  has  significantly  changed  with  the  stronger  importance \nattached  to  RCI  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  development  process  and  public  investment  efficiency  as \nindicated in the new socioeconomic development plan. Not only is the new MPI management \nvery keen on and committed to improving RCI-related work (with the new minister, who is \noriginally from a province, actively involved in and benefiting from RCI activities), it is also \nresponsible for rationalizing and reprioritizing public investment plans including RCI projects. \nThe government also focuses on public sector management as part of its effort to restructure \nthe economy. It is strongly recognized that improved policy coordination and capacity building \nare key to the reform process in general and Viet Nam\u2019s more productive integration into RCI \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Capacity Strengthening of Viet Nam\u2019s \nRegional Coordination and Public Investment Planning. Manila (TA 4788-VIE, approved on 11 May). \n7  The congress is held every 5 years and is seen as the most important platform to review and decide the country\u2019s \ndevelopment vision and strategies. \n ", "  3 \ninitiatives. Therefore, it is timely to provide the government with this TA to continue with its \nunfinished  agenda  for  RCI  institutional  and  capacity  strengthening  before  it  enters  a  new \ndevelopment decade of more comprehensive integration. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA aims to improve the efficiency of public investments for RCI initiatives. The TA\u2019s \nexpected  outcome  will  be  strengthened  capacity  and  coordination  for  effective  investment \nplanning of RCI activities in Viet Nam. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will take a focused approach to pilot expected changes with the GMS program \nwhich is considered the most active RCI initiative in Viet Nam, before replicating these changes \nin other RCI initiatives. Three outputs will be produced: (i) a national coordination network for \nthe GMS program, (ii) a national GMS investment framework and national GMS investment plan \nfor Viet Nam, and (iii) a capacity building program on GMS investment planning. These outputs \nwill help streamline and institutionalize the coordination mechanism for the GMS program, and \nprovide staff involved in GMS planning with investment directions and practical knowledge, skills, \nand tools to effectively participate in planning and programming GMS activities. This experiment \non the GMS program will provide good lessons for other RCI initiatives, which will contribute to \nstrengthening the capacity for and coordination of overall RCI investment planning in Viet Nam.  \n \n9.  National  coordination  network  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  program.  A \nnational coordination network will be set up to promote information sharing and consultation on \nthe  GMS  program  among  stakeholders.  The  network  will  comprise,  among  others, \nrepresentatives from central agencies involved in the GMS program, provinces participating in \nthe GMS corridors and projects, and the private sector. The network members are expected to \nmeet on a quarterly basis and/or as needed to discuss GMS policy-related issues, review the \nimplementation of the GMS program in Viet Nam, and agree on GMS annual investment plans. \nGMS network meetings will invite network members and other government officials suitable for \nselected meeting topics. Communication among network members will be promoted not only \nthrough network meetings but also via frequent online network exchange, as well as other \ntraditional paper-based communication. \n \n10.  The  current  National  GMS  Secretariat8 will  play  the  lead  role  in  running  the  GMS \ncoordination  network.  For  its  effective  function,  the  secretariat  will  be  strengthened  with \nadditional  resources  provided  by  the TA  and the  MPI,  including  international  and  national \nconsultants, and administrative support staff. Specifically, the secretariat will receive technical \nand administrative support to \n(i)   carry out a comprehensive review of current coordination mechanisms of key \nongoing RCI initiatives in Viet Nam, with a quick study on experience and models \nof other countries applicable to Viet Nam to draw useful lessons for the GMS \nprogram\u2019s coordination mechanism; \n                                                \n8  The MPI\u2019s Foreign Economic Relations Department was officially assigned the secretariat role of the GMS program \nin 2003, and its director general is the GMS national coordinator. The director general is mainly assisted in \nmonitoring and coordinating the GMS program by two departmental staff on a part-time basis.  \n ", "4   \n(ii)   develop a basic database of core RCI activities for information and reference by \nnetwork members;  \n(iii)   produce monthly national GMS e-updates to provide updated information on \nGMS-related policies and activities to network members;  \n(iv)   organize  regular  network  meetings  and  thematic  and/or  sector  meetings  as \nneeded;  \n(v)   draft appropriate and legally binding regulations on information dissemination, \nreporting, and planning of GMS activities based on operational experience of the \nnetwork for the government\u2019s consideration as necessary; and  \n(vi)   assess the applicability of the piloted GMS network to other RCI initiatives.  \n \n11.  These  assignments  will  help  the  network  function  more  effectively,  improving  the \ncoordination among GMS stakeholders. Three surveys (tentatively at the TA inception, midterm \nreview, and completion stages) will be conducted among network members on the performance \nof the secretariat and scope for improvement. The survey results will be used to help design, \nand  adjust  as  necessary,  the  technical  and  administrative  support  to  be  provided  to  the \nsecretariat under the TA. Under the TA a set of recommendations will be prepared on the \nappropriate role and responsibilities performed by the secretariat, the resource requirements \nneeded to ensure the sustainability of the secretariat function and the coordination network, and \npossible replication to other RCI programs after TA completion. \n \n12.  National Greater Mekong Subregion investment framework and national Greater \nMekong Subregion investment plan. The national GMS investment framework and plan will \nbe developed, taking in account relevant agreements made in the Regional GMS Investment \nFramework prepared in light of the GMS Strategic Framework, to make sure the Regional GMS \nInvestment  Framework  is  translated  into  national  and  subnational  plans  for  actual \nimplementation.  This  exercise  will  require  extensive  participation  of  a  wide  range  of \nstakeholders,  including  development  partners  and  the  private  sector,  to  mobilize  essential \nresources  for  the  regional  development  targets  by  the  completion  of  the  GMS  Strategic \nFramework, 2012\u20132022. Advice from major investors in Viet Nam, such as Japan and other \nGMS countries, will be useful. \n \n13.  Capacity  building  program in  regional  cooperation  and  integration  investment \nplanning. The program will be tailored to meet critical needs of government officials, especially \nthose at the provincial level involved in RCI work, particularly investment planning. Specific \ntraining courses will be determined during the TA implementation after a thorough training \nneeds assessment is conducted in close consultation with agencies concerned. The courses will \ncover general coordination skills, e.g., data compilation and analysis, and report writing skills for \njunior officials; and results-based and integrated investment planning for mid-level officials. The \ncapacity building program will also include thematic and/or sector policy training for government \nofficials  and  other  selected  stakeholder  representatives.  This  training  will  address  specific \nissues in prioritized areas of the GMS Strategic Framework. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB, and $50,000 will be \nprovided  by  the  government  to  supplement  TA  administration  and  support  costs.  The \ngovernment will also provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff remuneration, \nprovision of office space and office equipment as needed, and other in-kind contributions. Total \ngovernment counterpart support is estimated to account for 11% of the total TA cost. The cost \n ", "  5 \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. ADB will ensure that TA funding is made clear \nin public communications, meetings, and events funded by the TA and by other appropriate \nmeans. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The MPI will be the executing agency. The National GMS Secretariat established under \nthe MPI\u2019s Department of Foreign Economic Relations will manage day-to-day activities of the \nTA  with  assistance  from  international  and  national  consultants  provided  by  the  TA.  Close \ncoordination will be maintained with the Regional GMS Secretariat based in Manila. \n \n16.  The TA will require 8 person-months of international consulting services in regional \ncooperation institutional development, and 84 person-months of national consulting services in \nregional  cooperation,  economic  planning,  information  and  communication  technology,  and \nproject coordination. The outline terms of references for consultants are in Appendix 3. The \nconsultants will be recruited individually by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Engagement of individual consultants is \ndeemed suitable for this TA as expected outputs require knowledge of and experience in \nhandling a combination of multidimensional RCI matters, intragovernment coordination, and \npublic investment planning, as well as a good understanding of Viet Nam and other countries in \nthe GMS which participate in RCI initiatives. Technical expertise and training support provided \nthrough consulting services may be supplemented by engaging short-term resource persons on \nspecific subjects such as effective use of external development financing or foreign direct \ninvestment promotion, if necessary. Office equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The equipment will be handed \nover to the executing agency upon completion of the TA. Disbursements under the TA will be \nmade  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). The executing agency will administer costs for trainings and \nworkshops. An advance payment facility shall be used to receive deposits from ADB. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented from January 2013 to December 2015. The TA\u2019s expected \noutputs and outcome will be jointly monitored and evaluated by the MPI and ADB during TA \ninception, midterm, and final review missions. TA progress reports will be made on a quarterly \nbasis and discussed semiannually with the MPI and relevant government ministries. Project \nreports will be disseminated in TA workshops and on the MPI website. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to the Government \nof Viet Nam to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for \nCapacity Building and Coordination Improvement for Effective Regional Cooperation Investment \nPlanning, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact       Assumptions \n       \nImproved efficiency of  By 2017, at least 90% of  MPI investment  Timely supporting \npublic investments for  GMS projects will be  performance reports  policies will enable the \nRCI initiatives  processed, approved, and    smooth implementation \nimplemented in a timely  Donor and/or investor  of RCI initiatives. \nand effective manner  portfolio performance   \n(based on the project  reports  No drastic change in \nreadiness criteria and  regional cooperation \n \nportfolio performance  context that delays the \nindicators).  implementation of RCI \n      activities \nBy 2017, at least three RCI  Government decisions   \ninitiatives other than the  on coordination  Risk \nGMS program (e.g., East\u2013 mechanisms for RCI   \nWest Economic Corridor,  initiatives    Network for GMS \nDevelopment Triangle, and  program will not be \n \nTwo Corridors One Belt)  sufficiently maintained \nwill have an appropriate    after the TA completion \nnational coordination  because of limited \nmechanism.  government resources \n \n \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n \nStrengthened  By 2015, GMS investment  Network meeting  MPI will continue \ncapacity and  plan is endorsed by GMS  minutes  leading the coordination \ncoordination for  national coordination    of investment planning \neffective investment  network    and programming of all \nplanning and      RCI activities \nprogramming of RCI  By 2015, at least 90% of  Donor investment   \nactivities in Viet Nam  GMS projects will have  programs   Trained staff under the \nbeen listed in GMS    TA will continue \ninvestment plan  ADB COBP and/or  working in RCI areas \nROBP   \n    Risk \nDelays in adopting \nMPI\u2019s circular on \ninformation \ndissemination, \nreporting, and planning \nof GMS activities for \nimplementation \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 1  7 \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
