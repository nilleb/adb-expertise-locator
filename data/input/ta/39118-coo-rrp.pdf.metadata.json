They are weather systems with strong winds that circulate \nanticlockwise around low-pressure areas in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the \nsouthern hemisphere. They are capable of causing massive destruction in three ways: by \nhigh  winds,  heavy  rainfall  causing  inland  flooding;  and  storm-surge  flooding.  Tropical \ncyclones form near the equator near the open sea where the surface temperature is at least \n26\u00b0 Celsius. They may last with destructive power for 2 weeks or more. The warm sea \nprovides the overlying atmosphere with a continuous supply of energy and moisture, first to \ngenerate a tropical cyclone and then to maintain its destructive violence as it moves forward. \nThe diameter of a tropical storm, called the eye, may have a diameter ranging from 20\u2013150 \nkilometers (km) The source of energy is cut off when the storm crosses a coastline and \nmoves inland, thus reducing its destructive power.  \nThe Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale uses a 1\u20135 rating to measure the cyclone\u2019s intensity and \nis used to give an estimate of the potential property damage and flooding expected along the \ncoast from a cyclone landfall. Wind speed is the determining factor in the scale, as storm-\nsurge values are highly dependent on the slope of the continental shelf in the landfall region. \n \nCategory  Description of Hurricane \nFive  Involving winds greater than 249 km per hour (km/hr) and storm surge generally \ngreater than 6 meters above normal, it is capable of causing complete roof failure \non residential and industrial buildings; complete building failure with small utility \nbuildings blown over or away; blowing away shrubs, trees, and signs; destruction \nof mobile homes; severe and extensive window and door damage; interruption of \nlow-lying escape routes with rising water; major damage to lower floor structures \nlocated  less  than  5  meters  above  sea  level  and  within  450  meters  of  the \nshoreline; and typically requires evacuation of residential areas on low ground \nwithin 8\u201316 km of the shoreline. ", "Four  Involving winds of 210\u2013249 km/hr and storm surge generally at 4\u20136 meters above \nnormal,  it  is  capable  of  causing  extensive  curtain-wall  failure;  complete  roof \nstructure failure on small residences; strewn shrubs, trees, and tearing of signs; \ncomplete destruction of mobile homes; extensive damage to doors and windows, \nand interruption of low-lying escape routes with rising water in 3\u20135 hours before \narrival of the hurricane center; and major damage to lower floors and structures \nnear the shore. Terrain lower than 3 meters above sea level may be flooded \nrequiring massive evacuation of residential areas as far inland as 10 km. \nThree   Involving winds of 178\u2013209 km/hr and storm surge generally of 3\u20134 meters above \nnormal, it is capable of causing structural damage to small residences and utility \nbuildings  with  a  minor  amount  of  curtain-wall  failure,  blowing  down  trees, \ndestruction of mobile homes and poorly constructed signs, interruption of low-\nlying escape routes by rising water 3\u20135 hours before arrival of the hurricane \ncenter, destruction of smaller coastal structures due to flooding, damage to larger \nstructures due to battering of floating debris, and continuous inundation of terrain \nlower than 1.5 meters above mean sea level 13 km or more inland. Evacuation of \nlow-lying residences within several blocks of the shoreline may be required.  \nTwo  Involving winds of 154\u2013176 km/hr and storm surge generally 2\u20133 meters above \nnormal, it is capable of causing damage to roofing material, doors, and windows \nof buildings; considerable damage to shrubbery and trees with some trees blown \ndown; damage to mobile homes, poorly constructed signs, and piers; flooding of \ncoastal and low-lying escape routes for 2\u20134 hours before arrival of the hurricane, \nand small craft in unprotected anchorages break moorings.  \nOne   Involves winds of 119\u2013153 km/hr with storm surge generally 1.5\u20132 meters above \nnormal, it may not cause any real damage  to building structures, but could \ndamage unanchored mobile homes, shrubbery, and trees, and poorly constructed \nsigns; flood coastal roads; and result in minor pier damage. \n \nNOTE \n \nThe fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 30 June. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis report was prepared by a team consisting of S.

An initial environmental examination was undertaken \nAssessment  (summarized in Appendix 8). \nProject  The Cyclone Emergency Assistance Project will mitigate social \nDescription  and economic impacts of the 2005 cyclone damage by providing \nconcessional resources for the Government to meet the costs of \nthe recovery under a burden-shared recovery program and thus \nhelp the Government manage public finances prudently, despite \nadditional and unforeseen recovery expenditures.  \nRationale  The  2005  cyclones  caused  considerable  damage  to  essential \npublic infrastructure, businesses, and private homes. In the outer \nislands, disruption of productive activities has possible long-term \neconomic  implications.  The  Government  has  taken  immediate \naction to implement an emergency assistance program to alleviate \nthe human suffering associated with the cyclone damage, and has \nprepared a comprehensive recovery assessment and program for \nmitigating the social and economic impacts. In addition to the \nrecovery  costs  borne  by  the  business  community,  the \ncomprehensive damage assessment amounts to US$7.9 million, \nan expenditure that would place a considerable burden on the \nGovernment  budget,  redirecting  funds  from  (i)  development \nprograms and productive assets to rebuilding activities, and (ii) the \nreserves built for debt repayment. The Government has requested \nthat  a  cooperative  burden-sharing  arrangement,  involving \nhouseholds, businesses, the Government, the aid community, and \nthe proposed Project, be implemented to meet the unforeseen \nand additional recovery expenditures. \nObjectives and  The Project\u2019s main objective is to contribute to the sustainability of \nScope  economic growth by minimizing the damaging impact of the 2005 \ncyclones. The Project supports (i) the Government\u2019s capacity to \nimplement a comprehensive recovery action plan to mitigate the \nsocioeconomic impact of the cyclones by financing additional and \nunforeseen  recovery  expenditures,  and  (ii)  prudent  financial \nmanagement  of  Government  fiscal  resources  and  continued \nadherence  to  the  performance  ratios  under  the  1998  Manila \nAgreement. Eligible items to be financed under the Project include \nexpenditures in all categories of the recovery program, such as (i) \ncleanup, (ii) reinstatement of public services, (iii) reinstatement of \nessential structures and buildings, and (iv) materials and supplies. ", "ii   \nThese categories will restore the functionality of public utilities \n(such  as  water  and  power),  education,  health,  and  transport \nsector services. Eligible expenditures will be selected based on \nboth general criteria aimed at ensuring that project resources are \nutilized only to respond to the recovery needs; and specific criteria \nidentified under the functional areas. Eligible expenditures include \n(i)  roads: repair and cleanup of roads, bridges, and drainage; \n(ii)  ports: restore functionality or to a condition existing before \nthe cyclone damage; \n(iii)  power  supply:  repair  of  power  poles,  transformers, \ncertain  high  voltage  power  lines,  distribution  lines,  and \ndistribution infrastructure; \n(iv)  water supply: restore facilities to precyclone condition;  \n(v)  waste  management:  restore  facilities  to  precyclone \ncondition; \n(vi)  buildings: repair hospitals, health centers, staff quarters, \nand administrative buildings of government agencies; and \n(vii)  general cleanup: remove fallen trees and related debris \ncaused by the cyclones. \nCost Estimates  The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies, \ninterest  and  other  charges,  is  estimated  at  US$7.9  million \nequivalent, comprising US$1.8 million equivalent (23%) in local \ncurrency and US$6.1 million (77%) in foreign exchange. \n    Source    Amount    % \nFinancing Plan \n  (US$ million) \nADB    2.83    36 \n \nHouseholds    2.52    32 \n \nGovernments of Australia         \n  and New Zealand    1.16    15 \n  Government    1.36    17 \n               Total    7.87    100 \n               ADB = Asian Development Bank. \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) will finance 36% of costs \nunder all eligible cost categories of the recovery program. The \nremainder  of  the  costs  will  be  covered  by  households  (32%), \nGovernment of the Cook Islands (15%), and the governments of \nAustralia and New Zealand (17%). \nLoan Amount and  A  loan  of  SDR1,895,000  (US$2.83  million  equivalent)  will  be \nTerms  provided from the Special Funds resources. The loan will have a \n40-year term including a grace period of 10 years, an interest rate \nof 1% per year, and repayment of principal at 2% a year for the \nfirst 10 years after the grace period and 4% a year thereafter. \nPeriod of  Until November 2007 \nUtilization ", "  iii\nEstimated Project  April 2007 \nCompletion Date \nExecuting  Ministry of Finance and Economic Management (MFEM)  \nAgencies \nImplementation  MFEM will establish a project management unit, comprising a \nArrangements  project  manager  and  an  accountant,  with  a  professional \naccountancy  designation.  The  unit  will  report  to  the  MFEM \nfinancial secretary and operate under the guidance of a steering \ncommittee involving the heads of the implementing agencies: (i) \nMinistry  of  Works;  (ii)  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation, \nincluding the Ports Authority and Te Aponga Uira O Tumu-Te-\nVarovaro  (Te  Aponga  Uira-Power  Authority),  Rarotonga;  (iii) \nOffice  of  the  Minister  for  Island  Administration;  and  (iv) \nrepresentatives  of  development  partner  organizations,  as \nappropriate. The disbursements will be made through an imprest \naccount for payments for eligible expenditures selected, based on \nagreed criteria. The project accounts will be audited annually by \nexternal auditors. \nProcurement  Procurement of goods, services, and works will be carried out \nconsistent with ADB Guidelines for Procurement with the flexible \ninterpretation permitted for emergency assistance loans provided \nin  accordance  with  ADB  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance \nPolicy (2004) to ensure maximum expediency in implementing the \nrecovery program. The proceeds of the ADB loan will finance \nimports of goods and services, local purchases, and civil works \nidentified under the comprehensive damage assessment. Under \nADB Guidelines for Procurement, these may be procured through \ndirect  purchase,  international  shopping,  or  local  competitive \nbidding, as appropriate. ADB has approved the use of advance \nprocurement, retroactive financing, and local cost financing. Both \nlocal and prudent international shopping is recommended with the \nbid period reduced from 30 to 7\u201315 days. In the case of local \ncontractors, a registration system that lists approved contractors \nbased on criteria such as experience, and financial and technical \ncapacity may be used. Unit cost tenders are recommended for \nuse of local contractors, reflecting procurement procedures used \nfor normal commercial practices by the private sector. Community \nparticipation will be encouraged in all recovery activities. \nConsulting  Project management will require approximately 58 person-months \nServices  of consulting services for a project manager; an accountant with a \nprofessional accountancy designation; and technical support for \nspecific assessments, detailed design, contract supervision, and \nquality control. The project manager will engage consultants as \nneeded for specific recovery activities. The Government will select \nthese services in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants.  \nProject Benefits  The burden-shared recovery program will mitigate the otherwise \nand Beneficiaries  extended  negative  impacts  of  the  2005  cyclone  damage, \nparticularly on the poor, and enable the country to recover from ", "iv   \nthe emergency with only a temporary setback. The immediate \nbenefit  of  the  recovery  program  is  the  reinstatement  of  basic \nservices,  including  water  and  power  supply,  transport  sector \nfunctionality,  and  education  and  health  sector  services.  The \nProject  will  support  prudent  financial  management  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  fiscal  resources  enabling  maintenance  of  fiscal \nviability  and  debt  servicing  by  maximizing  the  concessional \nfunding for recovery expenditures.  \nRisks and  The risks related to efficient and prudent management of quick-\nAssumptions  disbursing recovery resources, including corruption and misuse of \nfunds  to  purposes  not  related  to  the  recovery  phase,  are \naddressed  by  (i)  established  and  agreed  detailed  selection \ncriteria;  (ii)  transparent  implementation  and  monitoring \nmechanisms involving a group of implementing agencies in the \ndecision making; (iii) engagement of adequate human resources \nfor  project  management,  including  for  safeguarding  financial \naccounting and control of expenditures under the loan; and (iv) \nexternal audit of accounts. \nThe 24-month implementation period is sufficient, given action \nalready under way under the recovery program, using retroactive \nfunding  available  under  the  Project,  and  streamlined  project \nmanagement procedures.  \nTechnical  ADB will provide a technical assistance grant of $600,000 for \nAssistance  Strengthening Disaster Management and Mitigation aimed at (i) \nestablishing  a  rapid,  effective,  and  robust  response  capability \nthrough efficiently coordinated networks of skilled personnel to \nadminister the current and future recovery response operations; \nand (ii) preparing an integrated and environmentally sustainable \ninfrastructure  master  plan  involving  infrastructure  designs  that \nincorporate  climate  change  adaptation  and  disaster  mitigation \nstrategies.

The report also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening Disaster Management and \nMitigation  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: ANALYSIS, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Natural Disasters in the Cook Islands \n2.  The Cook Islands consists of 15 widely dispersed small islands, comprising two main \ngroups, the southern Cook Islands (Rarotonga, Mangaia, Atiu, Aitutaki, Mauke, Mitiaro, and \nManuae  and  Takukea)  and  the  northern  Cook  Islands  (Nassau,  Palmerston,  Penrhyn, \nManihiki, Rakahanga, Pukapuka, and Suwarrow). Rarotonga, with a land area of 67 square \nkilometers (km2), is the largest; the smallest is Suwarrow (0.4 km2). The total land area of the \ncountry is 240 km2, while its exclusive economic zone covers a maritime area of nearly 2 \nmillion km2. Most of the islands are flat atolls, easily prone to inundation by storm surges. \nOnly Rarotonga is mountainous; its highest peak is 653 meters. \n \n3.  The climate is maritime tropical, dominated by easterly trade winds and a marked \nseasonality in the rainfall regime. The dry season is from May to October and the wet \nseason  from  November  to  April.  The  wet  season  is  also  the  tropical  cyclone  season, \nassociated with an easterly shift of the South Pacific Convergence Zone over the country. \nThe climate can vary significantly, especially in relation to the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation. \n \n4.  Tropical cyclone activity is more frequent during an El Ni\u00f1o event, when warmer than \nnormal sea surface temperatures (+26\u00b0Celsius [C]) coincide with an eastward migration of \nthe South Pacific Convergence Zone. This occurred in the vicinity of the Cook Islands and \nthe French Polynesia in February\u2013March 2005. During an El Ni\u00f1o event, the southern Cook \nIslands experiences a reduction in rainfall, to as little as 60% of normal, while in the northern \nCook Islands rainfall can increase to as much as 300% above normal.  \n \n5.  During the 1997/98 El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation event, tropical cyclones Martin and \nPam caused extensive damage to property and infrastructure and brought human suffering, \nincluding loss of lives. The southern group of islands experienced a prolonged drought. The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) supported the economic restoration of Manihiki, Pukapuka, \nand  Rakahanga  islands  after  a  disaster  caused  by  Cyclone  Martin  with  the  Cyclone \nEmergency Rehabilitation Project in 1997.1 The most damaging single cyclone event in \nrecent history was Cyclone Sally in 1987, with damage estimated to reach 66% of the gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP);  it  devastated  the  airport,  beach  hotels,  tourist  resorts,  and \nbusinesses near the sea. \n  \nB.  2005 Cyclone Impact  \n6.  Between 4 February and 8 March 2005, the Cook Islands experienced five damaging \ncyclones. Their wind speeds exceeded 200 kilometers per hour (kph) with cyclone Meena \npeaking at 280 kph; cyclone Nancy at 241 kph; cyclone Olaf at 259 kph, and cyclone Percy \nat 212 kph. Four of the five cyclones were given the maximum severity rating of category 5. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nGovernment of the Cook Islands for the Cyclone Emergency Rehabilitation Project. Manila. ", "2   \nThe first three cyclones formed close to Samoa and the last two near Tuvalu with sea \nsurface temperatures recorded at a high of 32\u00b0C. The cyclone tracking map and activity is \ndescribed in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Cyclone Damage Assessment \n7.  The Government asked the Cook Islands Investment Corporation (CIIC), responsible \nfor  the  management  of  public  assets,  to  prepare  a  damage  assessment  report  on \ngovernment properties after cyclones Meena, Nancy, and Olaf. In addition, stakeholder \nministries  prepared  separate  damage  reports  on  assets  under  their  responsibility. \nCoordinated by the Office of the Prime Minister, these reports provide a comprehensive \ndamage assessment.  \n \n8.  Component 1: Roads, Bridges, and Drainage. On Rarotonga, Aitutaki, Mauke, and \nMangaia, the cyclones caused considerable road damage. The storm surge deposited debris \non  coastal roads  and downed  trees. The  Ministry  of  Works  engaged  in  an  immediate \ncleanup operation (commencing 6 February), removing debris (mainly coral rocks and sand) \nand trees and repairing roads. These operations continued as subsequent cyclones added \nto the damage. By 9 March, cleanup works and repairs to road pavements were substantially \ncomplete. \n \n9.  Component 2: Ports. Harbors on Rarotonga, Aitutaki, Atiu, Mauke, Mangaia, and \nPukapuka  were  damaged.  In  the  main  port  of  Avatiu  on  Rarotonga,  wharf  facilities \nexperienced general damage as a result of Cyclone Meena, and then incurred extensive \nbreakwater damage as a result of cyclones Nancy and Olaf. Damage to the harbor on \nAitutaki  consisted  of  scour  behind  the  wharf  wall.  On  Mauke  and  Mangaia,  damaged \nslipways require urgent temporary repairs to make them useable. On Pukapuka, the wharf \nwall incurred scour and collapsed, and must be reconstructed. At Avatiu, repairs to wharf \nfacilities are complete, but the harbor basin needs to be cleared of debris. At Aitutaki, repairs \nto the wharf wall are complete. On Mauke and Mangaia, some clearing has been undertaken \nto permit use of slipways by small craft; major clearing work remains. No repairs have yet \nbeen carried out at Pukapuka. \n \n10.  Component 3: Power Supply. Power supplies were affected because underground \nhigh voltage cables were exposed to sea scour, and sea spray and water damaged six \nsubstations. Low voltage feeders were extensively damaged by falling trees. The majority of \nthe low voltage feeders have been temporarily restored but the lines themselves have \nsustained damage and need to be replaced. The underground high voltage cables remain \nisolated; no repairs have yet been undertaken. No repairs have been undertaken thus far to \nthe affected substations. \n \n11.  Component 4: Water Supplies. Water supplies escaped major damage, although \ntanks  and  roof  catchments  on  Pukapuka  and  Nassau  were  affected.  Communal  and \nindividual water tanks were either damaged or contaminated by seawater. Therefore, the \ndelivery of fresh drinking water became a priority in the immediate aftermath of Cyclone \nPercy. However, inhabitants were able to construct temporary water catchments, sufficient \nfor their basic needs. On Rarotonga, access to water treatment facilities was blocked and \ndamaged, and filter media requires replacement due to heavy siltation. \n \n12.  Component  5:  Waste  Management.  The  new  waste  management  landfill  in \nRarotonga suffered damage to its control center and rain cover along with other minor ", "  3\ndamage. The new facility cannot commence operations until this damage is repaired. This \nfacility was financed by the ADB Waste Management Project.2 \n \n13.  Component 6: Buildings and Materials. CIIC assessed damage to Government \nbuildings. Many have severe damage to roofs and consequent damage to internal fixtures \nand fittings. Similar damage was sustained by many private residences. On Pukapuka, \ndamage  to  buildings  was  particularly  severe  following  Cyclone  Percy  with  only  a  few \nescaping intact. Repairs commenced immediately on Rarotonga and are ongoing. On other \nislands, repairs have yet to commence. \n \n14.  Component 7: General Cleanup. On many islands, fallen trees, debris from the \nwater surge, and wind damage closed roads and passageways, filled drains, and prevented \naccess in general. Removal and deposit of all debris is a high priority.  \n \n15.  Agriculture.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  assessed  damage  to  agriculture  on  all \nislands.  The  extent  of  loss  varies  depending  on  the  type  of  crop  and  location,  but \nsubsistence gardens were particularly affected. Availability of local produce in the markets in \nmid March was extremely limited with recovery expected to take up to 12 months. \n \n16.  Telecommunications.  Damage  to  telecommunications  was  slight  and  quickly \nrepaired.  \n \n17.  Airports.  Airports  suffered  only  minor  damage.  The  Mangaia  airstrip  sustained \nerosion damage. The western end of the international airport was protected by bunds and \nthe presence of the main road and seawall. The road did however suffer some scour as did \nthe buried high voltage power cable. The road has been repaired but not the high voltage \ncable. Further work is necessary at Mangaia as repairs to date are only temporary. \n \nD.  Macroeconomic Impact \n18.  In spite of the common labor market and monetary association with New Zealand, \nthe Cook Island\u2019s economy is vulnerable because of its smallness, narrowly based island \neconomy, and political culture that need strong administrative oversight. In response to \nmounting financial crises, in 1996 the Government adopted an economic reform program to \ncorrect  economic  imbalances  and  restore  debt  sustainability  with  the  support  of  ADB-\nfacilitated debt restructuring.3 The Government remains committed to the objectives of the \n1998 Manila Agreement4 and the associated reform program aimed at prudent economic \nmanagement to generate growth and fiscal stability.  \n \n19.  The  country\u2019s  economy  achieved  its  sixth  consecutive  year  of  growth  in  2004. \nPreliminary data indicate that real GDP grew by 3.4%. The primary contributors to GDP of \nNZ$238 million (2003), or NZ$12,965 per capita, are tourism (54%), including the related \nretail, wholesale, and other consumption and financial services; agriculture and fisheries \n(16%); transportation (15%), and public administration (12%).  \n \n20.  The good economic conditions helped strengthen the fiscal position during 2004, \nleading to small increases in both the operating balance and net lending. Inflation was low at \n0.9%, attributable to a combination of an overall sound fiscal position; appreciation of the \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nGovernment of the Cook Islands for the Waste Management Project. Manila. \n3  ADB. 1996. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nGovernment of the Cook Islands for the Economic Restructuring Program. Manila. \n4  In 1998, ADB served as an honest broker in the restructuring of Cook Island\u2019s debt to four countries: France, \nItaly, Nauru, and New Zealand. ", "4   \nNZ$ (the currency used by the Cook Islands); and low inflation in New Zealand, the main \nsource of imports. \n \n21.  The improved fiscal conditions were recognized in October 2004, when Standard and \nPoor\u2019s Rating Services lifted the long-term rating on the Cook Islands to BB\u2013 from B+, \nreflecting the fourth upward revision of the rating since the initial B\u2013/C rating was assigned in \nJanuary 1998. This improvement was achieved with debt restructuring, debt repayments, \nand accumulation of cash debt repayment reserves.  \n \n22.  However, the Cook Islands was put on credit watch in early 2005 in light of economic \nthreat of the cyclones. Weakening of the Government\u2019s credit quality relates to (i) incurred \ncosts  to  the  economy;  (ii)  recovery  expenditures  in  excess  of  fiscal  capacity;  and  (iii) \nweakening fiscal revenues as a result of weaker economic activity after the 2005 cyclones, \nparticularly in the dominant tourism sector.5 External assistance, particularly through the \nProject, is necessary for the Government to meet the recovery expenditures in a manner that \nfosters prudent financial management of public resources and adherence to the performance \nratios  agreed  in  the  1998  Manila  Agreement.  Concessional  funding  to  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s  resource  management,  reinstatement  of  normal  social  and  economic \nactivities, and mitigation of the broader negative impacts on the economy will help to restore \nthe credit quality of the country.  \n \nE.  The Government\u2019s Response \n1.  Emergency Response \n23.  With tropical cyclones part of the maritime environment of the Cook Islands, the \nNational Hurricane Safety Plan consolidates6 procedures and department responsibilities in \naddressing cyclone threats. In accordance with arrangements under the purview of the \nInternational Meteorological Organization, the Cook Islands Meteorological Services (CIMS), \na department of the Police, received the 2005 cyclone warnings from the Fiji Regional \nMeteorological Service Center, in Nadi, Fiji Islands. In addition, CIMS obtained information \nfrom a variety of sources on weather patterns and warnings, including from the Honolulu \nTsunami  Center  and  Fiji  Regional  Meteorological  Service  Center.  CIMS  disseminated \nwarnings  to  the  chief  hurricane  safety  officer,  an  assignment  designated  to  the  police \ncommissioner under the Hurricane Safety Act of 1973 and to the population through special \nweather bulletins using three modes of communications: public radio, telephone, and very \nhigh  frequency  radio  communications.  On  the  outer  islands,  local  police  implemented \ninstructions received and reported back to the chief hurricane safety officer, who in turn \nbriefed the National Emergency Operation Center on the hourly feedback from the islands. \nRadio Cook Islands broadcast information on the cyclone threat 24 hours a day, and the \nGovernment mobilized the Rarotonga Hurricane Center to coordinate disaster preparedness \nactivities in the capital and with other islands. Several evacuation centers were established \nin response to the cyclones.7 Some low-lying areas were evacuated and shelters set up. \nWhile the Government did not declare a state of emergency for the first three cyclones, a \nstate of emergency was declared for Pukapuka and Nassau islands during the fourth, given \nthe  serious  damage  and  loss  of  most  homes  and  food  crops.  Thanks  to  efficient \ndissemination of early warning information, no human casualties were incurred.  \n \n24.  The Government and its agencies managed early warning information dissemination \nand evacuation, provided emergency relief to the affected population with the support of \n                                                 \n5  Melbourne, 18 Feb 2005.

Recovery Response \n25.  While  the  National  Hurricane  Safety  Plan  provides  guidance  for  disaster \nmanagement, operational procedures and agency roles in the immediate aftermath of a \ndisaster are not clearly set out or followed, and disaster management is susceptible to \ninefficiencies. The recovery assessments and response management is spread over several \nagencies and ad hoc committees, including the 5-person Emergency Operations Committee, \nenlarged  National  Disaster  Management  Team  established  on  21  February  2005  and \nchaired  by  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  chief  of  staff,  Cyclone  Aid  Coordination  Committee \nestablished on 24 February 2004, and National Emergency Operation Center convened on \nan ad hoc basis to respond to the emergency caused by the cyclones. Strengthening of \ndisaster and recovery management, including damage assessment, aid management, and \noperational  coordination  is  immediately  required  to  ensure  rapid,  effective,  and  robust \nresponse by an efficient network of skilled personnel and procedures. Strengthening of \nfinancial controls is also needed for management of fast-disbursing recovery funds.  \n ", "6   \n3.  Development and Prevention \n26.  The Government recognizes the deficiencies of the immediate response mounted to \nsupport emergency and humanitarian action. Accordingly, the Government is keen to review \n(i) the prevailing regional, national, and subnational strategies for emergency response; (ii) \nconcepts and instruments for crises prevention and application in economic development \nand development cooperation; (iii) standards for service delivery and essential infrastructure \nto address weather-related vulnerabilities and protection of key infrastructure and climate \nchange  adaptation,  including  reinforcement  of  vulnerable  structures  and  adjustment  of \nbuilding and land-use zones; (iv) construction of breakwater protection for the town center, \nport, other key national assets, and low-lying areas; (v) hazard reduction technology; and (vi) \ninfrastructure management and governance conditions in keeping with the prudent financial \nmanagement framework provided in the 1998 Manila Agreement. To develop a pragmatic \napproach,  the  Government  has  asked  ADB  to  provide  TA  to  strengthen  disaster \nmanagement and mitigation (paras. 70\u201371) to review 20-year infrastructure requirements, in \naccordance  with  international  practices,  and prepare  an  integrated plan  to  support  the \neconomic  and  social  development  of  the  Cook  Islands,  incorporating  climate  change \nadaptation concepts and improvements in infrastructure sector governance.  \n \nF.  Financing Recovery Needs  \n27.  Since  Cyclone  Olaf,  Government  agencies  have  been  occupied  with  preparing \ndamage assessments with the support of the Government interagency teams for the outer \nislands,  Red  Cross,  and  United  Nations  Disaster  Assessment  Group.  The  recovery \nassessment identified damage costs on a replacement basis. Restoration of public assets is \nestimated using selective criteria for reinstating functionality of the service to a safe and \nproductive standard, thus removing facilities that add only limited value to service delivery. \nTotal damage is estimated at NZ$10.5 million (US$7.9 million). In spite of the current budget \nreserves,  the  Government  lacks  resources  to  finance  the  immediate  recovery  and \nreinstatement of basic services. \n \n1.  Funding the Recovery Costs \n28.  Funding of the recovery program will be arranged within provisions of the 1998 \nManila Agreement (footnote 3). The Manila Agreement, supported by ADB, enabled the \nCook Islands to resolve a serious fiscal and economic crisis and resulted in a rescheduling \nof debt to the country\u2019s official bilateral creditors. The associated reform program led to \nimproved country economic performance. The debt restructuring reduced the face value of \nthe Government\u2019s debt by more than 30% and provided concessions on interest rates. The \nGovernment\u2019s borrowing capacity has since improved with net debt reduced to 38% of GDP \n(June 2004), compared with 109% in June 1997.  \n \n29.  By June 2005, debt reserves are expected to amount to NZ$18.4 million against total \nborrowings of NZ$97.8 million. These financial assets are deposited with local commercial \nbanks. Standard & Poor\u2019s considers the country\u2019s investment rating would be at risk if these \nreserves are spent before they can be used for debt repayment. To ensure prudent financial \nmanagement and viability of its public finances, the Government is determined not to spend \nthese  reserves  to  finance  the  additional  and  unforeseen  expenditures  arising  from  the \nrecovery  related  to  the  2005  cyclones.  Moreover,  to  finance  these  expenditures,  the \nGovernment has requested a loan under the ADB Disaster and Emergency Assistance \nPolicy. Due to the high level of concessional resources, the Project will increase the debt \nservice obligation of the Cook Islands by only 0.9% in the first 10 years and by 1.4% in the \nnext 20 years, and will increase the debt to GDP ratio to 41% from the current 38%. \n ", "  7\n30.  The Government revised its forecast for 2004/05 fiscal revenues by a total of NZ$2.0 \nmillion, from NZ$70 million to NZ$68 million; NZ$1.0 million of which is due to the cyclone \nimpact. In response to the damage reports and the related unforeseen demand for fiscal \nresources, the Government has approved appropriations exceeding budget revenues by \nNZ$1.5  million,  referring  to  Section  70(3)(b)  of  the  Constitution,  which  authorizes \nexpenditure of funds in excess of budget resources without prior approval of the Parliament \nand equivalent to 1.5% of the total budget. These funds will be expended in addition to the \nNZ$480,000 budget allocation for the recovery program.8  \n \n2.  Portfolio Management and Restructuring \n31.  The ADB program for the Cook Islands includes one loan of $2.2 million for waste \nmanagement; the project is near completion.9 The project incurred cost overruns due to (i) \nunfavorable movements in the SDR currencies against the New Zealand dollar, in which \nproject costs were denominated; and (ii) technical reasons. Consequently, the loan proceeds \nhave been expended and are not available for reallocation. \n \n32.  The  TA  portfolio  involves  two  ongoing  TAs:  Strengthening  Economic  and \nDevelopment  Planning  and  Management,  and  Legal  and  Institutional  Strengthening  for \nImplementation of Cook Islands Environment Act of 2003. The former will be canceled \nbecause the Government is making its own resources available for the national planning \nprocesses. The latter TA is providing helpful advice on implementation of the Environment \nAct to the Ministry of National Environmental Services and the Crown Law Office (Office of \nthe Solicitor General).  \n \nG.  Response of the Development Partners \n33.  The  governments  of  Australia,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  France,  and  New \nZealand; Pacific Forum, Red Cross; and United Nations agencies, particularly through the \nUnited  Nations  Disaster  Assessment  Group,  provided  assistance  for  immediate \nhumanitarian and emergency relief. The Aid Management Division of the Ministry of Finance \nand Economic Management (MFEM) manages disbursement of the relief and recovery aid. \nThe donors, particularly the governments of New Zealand and Australia, have agreed to  \nreallocate funds from ongoing aid programs to cover additional restoration requirements \nrelated  to  assets  receiving  support  from  these  regular  aid  programs.  These  funds  will \ncontribute to burden-shared financing of the recovery program. \n \nH.  Lesson Learned in Disaster Management \n1.  Development and Prevention \n34.  In  the  Pacific,  including  in  the  Cook  Islands,  population  centers  and  economic \nactivities are concentrated in the coastal zones and are vulnerable to the effects of climate \nchange, particularly an increase in extreme weather events, and sea-level rise. The five \nrecent successive cyclones may relate to a changing climate pattern and increased El Ni\u00f1o \neffect. Concurrently, development and social change have placed pressure on sensitive \necosystems of the Cook Islands. \n \n35.  Given  the  unique  climate  change  vulnerabilities  of  the  Cook  Islands,  closer \nmanagement of development will be essential, particularly to protect sensitive coastal areas \nand foreshores to reduce their vulnerability to the additional stresses arising from climate \n                                                 \n8  Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. 9 March 2005.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nCook Islands for the Waste Management Project. Manila. ", "8   \nchange and sea-level rise. Mainstreaming climate change adaptation and sea-level rise \nissues  into  Government  policy  and  development  programs,  particularly  in  infrastructure \nstandards,  is  essential.  Adaptation  and  mitigation  strategies  need  to  be  based  on  an \nintegrated  and  comprehensive  approach  that  accounts  for  sustainability concerns,  both \nenvironmental and cultural.  \n \n36.  In the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the \nCook Islands highlights the need for a national adaptation strategy that prioritizes measures \nto reduce risks associated with climate change. Climate change manifests through increased \nfrequency of extreme weather events rather than long-term trends in average conditions. \nAdapting to the current climate extremes and variability prevents loss of scarce financial and \nother  resources  on  disaster  recovery  and  rehabilitation,  and  is  an  essential  step  to \nwithstanding  climate  changes.  Most  importantly,  climate  change  adaptation  should  be \nincorporated in the design of social as well as infrastructure projects. The Government asked \nfor TA to strengthen disaster management and mitigation (para. 26). The TA will provide a \nframework for planning infrastructure development to support social and economic welfare \nimprovement in the country through policy and program designs that incorporate climate \nchange adaptation, including climate proofing and mitigation strategies.  \n \n2.  Disaster and Emergency Management \n37.  While the country has experienced several major cyclones in the past, the recent \n2005 cyclones increased awareness of the need for a robust risk management strategy, and \nfor  disaster  and  emergency  management  capacity.  Experience  in addressing the  2005 \ncyclones  reveals  that  disaster  management  requires  strengthening  and  clear  lines  of \ncommunication and accountability need to be established. The current disaster management \nmodality is operating without strong guidance and relies on fiscal overspending.  \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n38.  The  Government  is  implementing  a  countrywide  recovery  action  plan  with  the \nobjective of reinstating basic social services and economic activities. The objectives of the \nProject are to support the Government by providing concessional financing for expenditures \ncrucial for recovery.  \n \n39.  The  Project  will  focus  on  priority  areas  identified  through  consultation  with  the \nGovernment, private sector, civil society, and development partners for reinstatement of \nbasic  services.  The  expenditures  under  all  categories  of  the  comprehensive  recovery \nassessment are eligible for funding under the Project, provided that these relate to (i) \ncleanup; (ii) infrastructure reinstatement (ports, power supply, water supply and sanitation \nincluding waste management, roads, drainage, and bridges); (iii) basic service delivery \nstructures and facilities (schools, hospitals, government service facilities); and (iv) essential \nmaterials and supplies (learning materials, refurbishment inventory). \n \nB.  Main Features  \n40.  The Project is designed to allow for maximum flexibility. It includes quick-disbursing \ncomponents and retroactive financing of up to 30% of the loan proceeds\u2014this is available \nfor eligible expenditures incurred prior to project approval. An imprest account will be set up \nfor the loan funds to facilitate payments to suppliers of goods and services, and thus enable \nthe proceeds to benefit the victims of the disaster in a timely manner. The Project is also \ndesigned to accommodate changes in the recovery costs, which were at best preliminary at ", "  9\nthe time of design, through its flexible design and allotted physical contingencies. At the time \nof design, all aid partners had not yet received requests from the Government for support. \nWith  identification  of  eligible  expenditure  categories  in  the  comprehensive  damage \nassessment, the Project fosters effective partnerships by enabling the Government to apply \ngrant  aid  funding  to  finance  expenditure  items  and  enables  funding  of  the  remaining \nfinancing  gap  by  the  loan  proceeds.  This  design  enables  prudent  public  financial \nmanagement and allows for maximum use of concessional funds in financing the recovery. \n \nC.  Outputs \n1.  Assessment \n \n41.  All  affected  Government  agencies  prepared damage assessments,  including  the \nMinistry of Works (for roads, bridges, drainage, water supplies, and waste management on \nRarotonga), Office of the Minister for Island Administration (for roads, power, harbors, and \nbuildings in the outer islands), CIIC (for government buildings and some private buildings \nand  community  facilities  on  Rarotonga  and  the  outer  islands),  Te  Aponga  (the  power \nauthority covering Rarotonga), Cook Islands Telecommunications (all islands), and the Ports \nAuthority (for Rarotonga and Aitutaki). On the basis of these reports, an overall assessment \nof  damage  was  compiled  into  a  comprehensive  recovery  assessment.  Both  incurred \nexpenditures and planned recovery activities within the scope of the assessment will be \neligible for project funding in accordance with the agreed eligibility criteria (paras. 42\u201351). \n \n2.  Eligibility Criteria \n42.   Using the comprehensive damage assessment, the project steering committee (PSC) \n(para.  56)  will  identify  and  select  recovery  activities  for  funding  under  the  Project  in \naccordance with the following general and specific criteria. The recovery activity will \n \n(i)  rehabilitate or reinstate infrastructure and/or facilities damaged as a result of \nthe 2005 cyclones, as included in the comprehensive recovery assessment; \n(ii)  incorporate  appropriate  cyclone-resistant  design  standards  with  adequate \nprovision for quality control;10 \n(iii)  be technically feasible, cost-effective, financially sustainable, and represent a \nleast-cost alternative with appropriate adjustment for incorporating cyclone-\nresistant design; \n(iv)  include beneficiary consultation in the selection process; \n(v)  be completed within the project implementation period, and \n(vi)  give priority to activities that restore functionality of the waste management \nfacility funded by the Waste Management Project (footnote 2). \n \n3.  Recovery Activities \n \n43.   Component-specific criteria were developed for each of the seven components. \n \n44.   Component  1:  Roads,  Bridges,  and  Drainage.  The  waves  generated  by  the \ncyclones caused roads in coastal areas on Rarotonga and Aitutaki to be blocked by debris. \nThe debris consisted of rocks and sand washed from the foreshore onto the road, as well as \nfallen trees and other debris. As a consequence, all roads were impassable necessitating \n                                                 \n10  Cook Islands Buildings Standards Controls and Act 1991; Building Controls and Standards Regulations. 1991; \nand Building Code 1990. ", "10  \nthe use of machines and labor for their clearance. Similarly, drains and bridge waterways \nwere blocked by debris. Scour of road surfaces necessitates repairs to the bituminous seal. \nEligible expenditures include the cost of repairs and cleanup of roads, bridges, and drainage. \n \n45.   Component 2:  Ports. Harbors were damaged in Rarotonga, Aitutaki, Atiu, and \nPukapuka. All damage to the Aitutaki port will be repaired using the reserves of the Ports \nAuthority. Infrastructure affected includes harbor basins and access channels (requiring \nclearing of rocks and other debris deposited by the waves), concrete ramps, hard standing \nareas,  storage  facilities,  electrical  equipment,  and  lighting.  Pukapuka  wharf  requires \ncomplete reconstruction. Eligible expenditures include the costs of repairs to ports and \nharbors necessary to restore functionality or to a condition existing before the cyclone \ndamage. \n \n46.   Component 3: Power Supply. Power stations did not sustain serious structural \ndamage, however, breakage of overhead power lines, damaged power poles, and damaged \ntransformers and other accessories were incurred both on Aitutaki and Rarotonga. Specific \ndamage was caused on Rarotonga to the high voltage line between Pokioinu and Oasis \nservice station, as well as water damage to 6 substations. Eligible expenditures include \nrepairs to the specific damage on Rarotonga noted here, along with repairs of general \ndamage to the distribution lines and distribution infrastructure on Aitutaki. \n \n47.  Component 4: Water Supply. Damage to water supply systems includes blockage \nof access roads, contamination of filter beds, broken pipes, and other damaged water \ndistribution infrastructure. Eligible expenditures include the cost of reinstating the facilities to \ntheir precyclone condition. The Project does not include provision for guttering and water \ntanks unless associated with the restoration of a public building. \n \n48.  Component 5: Waste Management. Cyclone damage to the newly constructed \nwaste  management  facilities  on  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki  is  to  be  repaired.  Eligible \nexpenditures include those necessary to restore the facilities to their precyclone condition. \n \n49.  Component  6:  Buildings  and  Materials.  Government  buildings  in  Rarotonga, \nAitutaki, Palmerston, Pukapuka, and Nassau were damaged by the cyclones. In particular, \nroofs have been affected to varying degrees from limited loss of tin sheeting to complete \nloss. In many cases, loss may be due to inadequate original construction standard, lack of \nmaintenance, or age. In cases where complete renewal of a roof is considered appropriate, \nthe new roof will be designed, constructed, and certified in accordance with the Building \nControls  and  Standards  of  the  Cook  Islands,11  particularly  as  they  relate  to  cyclone \nresistance.  Eligible  expenditures  will  include  repairs  to  hospitals,  health  centers,  staff \nquarters, and administrative buildings of government agencies; but will exclude schools \nbeing accommodated under other assistance programs. \n \n50.  Component 7: General Cleanup. On many islands, fallen trees, debris from the \nwater surge, and wind damage closed roads and passageways, filled drains, and prevented \naccess in general. Eligible expenditures include general cleanup of fallen trees, debris from \nwater surge, and other debris.  \n \n51.  The recovery activities will be selected in accordance with the general and the \nspecific criteria given in paras. 42\u201350. Relevant Government agencies will submit proposed \nrecovery activities for review of the project management unit (PMU) (para. 57) and for \nconsideration and approval of the PSC. The recovery activity application for project funding \n                                                 \n11  Cook Islands Buildings Standards Controls and Act 1991; Building Controls and Standards Regulations. 1991; \nand Building Code 1990. \n ", "  11\nincludes (i) a description of the recovery activity and design, as warranted; (ii) an account of \nthe use of internal/budget reserves; (iii) a description of efforts made to obtain grant funding; \n(iv) the proposed procurement process; (v) disbursement plan and time frame; (vi) an \nenvironmental assessment and mitigation plan; (vii) a description of beneficiary consultation \nand results; (viii) performance monitoring indicators and targets; and (ix) a date for the \nsubmission  of  compliance/completion  certificate.  A  format  for  the  recovery  activity \napplication is in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n52.  The total estimated cost of the recovery program is NZ$10.5 million or US$7.9 million \nequivalent, including US$1.8 million equivalent in local currency costs and US$6.1 in foreign \nexchange costs. The cost estimates are based on the Government\u2019s interagency damage \nassessment  appraised  by  the  ADB  Damage  Assessment  Mission.  They  incorporate \nappropriate provisions for loan administration and management to ensure application of \ngood governance for project administration, including safeguarding the quality, timeliness, \nand economic efficiency for implementation of the recovery activities; financial controls, and \nadherence  to  eligibility  criteria  for  expenditures  under  the  Project;  interest  during \nimplementation of the Project; and contingencies.

Ongoing verification of the financing plan will be undertaken during \nreview missions. Table 3 summarizes the financing plan. \n \nTable 3: Financing Plan \n(US$ million) \nSource  Amount  Percent \nAsian Development Bank  2.83  36 \nHouseholds  2.52  32 \nGovernments of Australia and New Zealand  1.36  17 \nGovernment  1.16  15 \n  Total  7.87  100 \n     Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Executing and Implementing Agency  \n55.  MFEM, as the Executing Agency, will be responsible for coordinating overall project \nimplementation. To ensure efficient implementation, MFEM may coordinate with one or more \nof the implementing agencies for each project component. The implementing agencies will \nbe (i) the Ministry of Works for components 1, 4, 5, and 7; (ii) the Ports Authority for \ncomponent 2; (iii) CIIC for component 6, as well as component 3 for activities in Aitutaki; (iv); \nTe Aponga Uira O Tumu-Te-Varovaro (Te Aponga Uira-Power Authority) for component 3 \nactivities  in  Rarotonga;  and  (v)  Office  of  the  Minister  for  Island  Administration  for \ncomponents 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. To ensure interagency coordination and integration of project \nimplementation, MFEM will be assisted by a PSC and PMU.  \n \n2.  Steering Committee \n56.  The Government will form a PSC to be chaired by the financial secretary of MFEM \nand  comprising  the  chief  executive  officer  of  CIIC,  president  of  Pukapuka  Rarotonga \nCommunity,  and  the  chief  executive  officers  of  the  project  implementing  agencies,  as \nneeded. Representatives of the New Zealand High Commission will participate in the PSC \nmeetings, as warranted. The PSC secretary will be the project manager. The PSC will meet \nas frequently as required, but no less than quarterly. It will (i) determine the use of funds \nunder  the  Project  within  the  categories  developed  by  the  comprehensive  recovery \nassessment and using the selection criteria; (ii) review quarterly reports, providing a view on \nproject performance in a separate statement; (iii) provide ADB with quarterly reports on \nproject progress; (iv) resolve emerging issues in project implementation, procurement, and \ncommunity  employment,  among  others;  and  (v)  supported  by  the  PMU,  prepare  and \ndisseminate information to the public on project activities, with a particular focus on timing of \nrestoration activities, benefits including social and economic impact of the restoration, and \napplication of cyclone-resistant designs, where appropriate. The PSC will be maintained until \n30 April 2007. \n \n2.  Project Management \n57.  The PMU will be established by loan effectiveness, be headed by a competent \nproject manager, and include an accountant with a professional accountancy designation. \nThe project manager will administer all aspects of the Project, including its contracts, in \naccordance with ADB guidelines, and will be accountable to MFEM and ADB for the quality ", "  13\nand timeliness of recovery activity implementation and contract management. The qualified \naccountant will review proposed expenditures for procurement of goods and services under \nthe Project in accordance with established eligibility criteria. The PMU will be funded under \nthe Project. Terms of reference for the PMU are in Appendix 5. \n \n3.  Implementation Schedule \n58.  The Project will be implemented over 24 months, commencing in May 2005. Every \nquarter, the PMU will prepare a detailed implementation schedule for recovery activities. The \nPMU project manager and certified accountant will be selected no later than when the \nProject is approved and effective. Retroactive financing of eligible expenditures will be made \nimmediately  after  project  approval.  The  recovery  activities  under  the  Project  will  be \ncompleted by April 2007. ADB and the Government will jointly conduct a comprehensive \nmidterm review 1 year after loan approval. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n59.  The  Project  will  require  approximately  48  person-months  of  consulting  input.  In \naddition  to  the  project  manager  and  an  accountant  with  a  professional  accountancy \ndesignation, a consultant with technical expertise in specific assessment, detailed design, \ncontract supervision, and quality control will be engaged for up to 10 person-months. These \nconsultants will comprise the PMU, which will be located at MFEM. All consultants will be \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Given the \ntight implementation schedule of the Project, ADB has agreed with the Government that \ndirect engagement of consultants be undertaken, as provided for under these guidelines.  \n \n5.  Procurement \n60.  Procurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  carried  out  consistent  with  ADB \nGuidelines  for  Procurement,  with  the  flexible  interpretation  permitted  for  emergency \nassistance loans provided in accordance with the ADB Disaster and Emergency Assistance \nPolicy  (2004).  The  loan  proceeds  will  finance  imports  of  goods  and  services,  local \npurchases, and civil works identified under the comprehensive recovery assessment. Under \nADB  Guidelines  for  Procurement,  these  may  be  procured  through  direct  purchase, \ninternational  shopping,  or  local  competitive  bidding,  as  appropriate.  Use  of  advance \nprocurement, retroactive financing, and local cost financing are recommended as are use of \ncompetitive processes with the objective of economic efficiency. Both local and prudent \ninternational shopping is recommended with the bid period reduced from 30 to 7\u201315 days. \nLocal competitive bidding may be applied to civil works contracts; international shopping \nmay be applied for civil works contracts with an estimated cost below US$1,000,000; and \ndirect purchase will be limited to contract amounts of less than US$100,000. In the case of \nlocal contractors, a registration system that lists approved contractors based on criteria such \nas experience, and financial and technical capacity may be used. Unit cost tenders are \nrecommended for use of local contractors, reflecting procurement procedures for normal \nprivate sector commercial practices. ADB procedures for providing reconstruction assistance \nafter disasters allow maximum flexibility, so that project activity can commence promptly.  \n \n6.  Advance Procurement Action \n61.  Given the urgency of the recovery activities, ADB approved advance action for the \nprocurement of goods and services, and recruitment of consultants by direct selection, \nprovided this takes place on or after 4 February 2005, the stated date of the first cyclone. \nThe Government has advised that approval of such advance action does not commit ADB to \nfinance any part of the recovery program. ", "14  \n7.  Disbursement \n62.  The Project is designed to provide quick disbursing resources to finance the recovery \nprogram. Disbursements are allowed for up to 100% of the eligible project costs. Eligible \nexpenditures will be made through an imprest account, and its replenishment, in accordance \nwith ADB Disbursement Guidelines set out in the Loan Disbursement Handbook (2001). The \nproject manager, supported by the certified accountant, will be responsible for transactions, \nreplenishments, and use of the imprest account. \n   \n63.  The imprest account procedure will be used for disbursing funds under all cost \ncategories eligible for financing. The account will be established at a commercial bank \nsituated on Rarotonga. ADB statement of expenditure procedure will be used for reimbursing \nexpenditures and liquidating the imprest account for payments with value equal to or below \nUS$50,000  each.  The  currency  of  the  imprest  account will  be the  US  dollar,  and  the \nmaximum  initial  advance  will  be  US$500,000.  The  project  manager,  supported  by  the \nconsultant accountant, will be responsible for administrative and accounting tasks under the \nProject; and will establish adequate internal control, accounting, and auditing procedures to \nensure efficient use of the imprest account and its operation.  \n \n8.  Retroactive Financing \n64.  For  immediate  emergency  response,  up  to  30%  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be \nconsidered  for  retroactive  financing  for  eligible  categories  of  expenditures  under  the \ncomprehensive recovery assessment. The covered expenditures must have been incurred \nor paid on or after 4 February 2005 in order to finance urgent expenditures necessary to \nrestore essential public services.14 \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n65.  Each  implementing  agency  will  carry  out  project  performance  monitoring  and \nevaluation in accordance with the ADB Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \nHandbook. Baseline indicators and targets for each recovery activity will be developed prior \nto implementation for monitoring purposes as well as for checking against the selection \ncriteria. These will be developed in the recovery activity application and will feed into the \nquarterly project report. \n \n10.  Midterm Review \n66.  In  addition  to  a  schedule  of  regular  reviews  to  monitor  project  progress,  a \ncomprehensive project review will be carried out 1 year after commencement. The focus of \nthe review is to determine the need for any deviations from the design or implementation of \nthe  Project.  The  review  will  also  assess  adequacy  of  funds,  cost  overruns,  need  for \nreallocations,  and  other  factors  including  assumptions  and  risks  that  might  constrain \nsatisfactory project implementation and achievement of development objectives. \n                                                 \n14  The first cyclone occurred on 4 February 2005. The Government focused its resources on relief and recovery \naction and addressed the damage from the next four cyclones by organizing equipment for the cleanup \noperation and restoration of public utilities (water, power). These activities are considered of utmost importance \nas the Cook Islands economy is reliant on tourism; longer-term interruptions would have caused impacts on \nthe  revenues,  fiscal  revenues,  investment,  and  employment,  throughout  the  economy.  Financing  of \nexpenditures incurred are necessary because of the exceptional circumstances in this case, which prevented \nan ADB mission from occurring immediately after the first cyclone. \n ", "  15\n11.  Accounts, Audits, and Reports \na.  Accounts and Audits \n67.  The PMU will establish and maintain separate records and accounts for all project \nexpenditures, including individual contracts and other recovery activities. These accounts will \nbe adequate to identify the goods and services financed by the loan proceeds, the financing \nsource, expenditures incurred, and use of local funds; and will provide detailed records on \nthe costing and expenditures of the recovery activities. The accounts will be set up in \naccordance with sound accounting principles. The financial statements for these accounts \nwill  be  audited  annually  using  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  by  externally \nrecruited  international  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  Government  will  engage \ninternational consulting services for the audit in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants. The audited financial statements together with the auditor\u2019s report will be \nforwarded to ADB within 6 months of the end of each related fiscal year.  \n \n68.  All project activities will be subject to independent performance audits to ensure their \ntransparency and to provide an objective and independent assessment. In addition, ADB will \nconduct project procurement audits during implementation as part of its regular reviews. \nADB also reserves the right to conduct a \u201cspecial audit\u201d focusing on governance, financial \naccountability  (e.g.,  certification  of  accounts),  and  transparency  soon  after  project \ncompletion. The audit costs will be funded under the Project.  \n \nb.  Reports \n69.  With  the  PMU  monitoring  overall  implementation  progress,  each  implementing \nagency will prepare a brief recovery activity application for funding under the Project. The \nPMU will prepare a comprehensive quarterly report on project activities. Within 3 months of \nphysical completion of the recovery activities, the Government will provide ADB, through the \nPMU, with an overall project completion report providing a detailed evaluation of the project \ndesign, costs, contractor and consultant performance, social and economic impact, and \nother details requested by ADB. \n \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n70.  The Government recognizes the need to improve its capacity to manage emergency \nresponse and develop an effective planning framework for mitigating its vulnerability to \nclimate change. It also concludes that social infrastructure is ill-prepared for weather-related \nproblems, as highlighted under the Climate Change Adaptation Project for the Pacific.15 The \nGovernment has accepted the assertions made under this TA that the country\u2019s inherent \ngeographic  vulnerability  to  climate  change  can  be  ameliorated  by  initiating  integrated \ninfrastructure  and  social  development,  including  human  resource  development. \nConsequently,  the  Government  intends  to  implement  the  recommendations  for  climate \nproofing the country, or to enhance the country\u2019s adaptive capacity and resilience to climate \nchange  and  climate  variability,  including  changes  in  extreme  events.  Overall,  the \nGovernment aims to strengthen disaster management and mitigation capacity to ensure that \nfuture social and infrastructure program designs incorporate climate change adaptation and \nmitigation  strategies,  and  are  thus  capable  of  delivering  the  envisaged  benefits  to  the \ncommunity.  \n \n71.  ADB will provide a TA grant of $600,000 for Strengthening Disaster Management and \nMitigation. The total cost of the TA will be US$755,350 equivalent, with $467,640 in foreign \n                                                 \n15 ADB.2005. Technical Assistance for the Climate Change Adaptation Program for the Pacific. Manila.  ", "16  \nexchange and $287,710 equivalent in local currency (Appendix 7). ADB will finance the \nentire foreign exchange cost ($467,640) and $132,360 equivalent of the local currency cost. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis by the ADB TA funding program. The Government \nwill contribute $155,350 equivalent by providing office space and logistical support, office \nsupport  and  counterpart  staff,  workshop  and  training,  report  preparation,  and  local \ntransportation  to  remote  locations.  The  TA  will  support  (i)  strengthening  disaster  and \nemergency management, and (ii) preparation of 20-year integrated and environmentally \nsustainable  infrastructure  planning  that  incorporates  climate  change  adaptation  in  the \nrecommendations for the design of social and infrastructure development planning and \nprogramming. The TA will help the Government establish a rapid, effective, and robust \nresponse  capability  through  efficiently  coordinated  networks  of  skilled  personnel  to \nadminister the current and future recovery response operations. Under the long-term master \nplan,  the  TA  will  help  the  Government  adopt  a  systematic  approach  to  mitigating  the \ncountry\u2019s  vulnerability  to  adverse  weather  conditions  through  design  of  institutions  and \nenvironmentally sustainable infrastructure with capacity to impede the reoccurrence of a \ndisaster with harmful effects on communities and key infrastructure. The master plan is \nexpected to be updated at least every 5 years in line with good practice. ADB will engage \nconsulting services for the TA in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic \nconsultants. Qualified individual consulting services will be selected for component 1 of the \nTA, and the quality and cost-based selection method will be used for selecting international \nconsultant services for component 2 based on simplified technical proposals.  \n \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Benefits \n72.  The burden-shared recovery program will mitigate the otherwise extended negative \nimpacts of the 2005 cyclone damage, particularly on the poor, and enable the country to \nrecover from the emergency with only a temporary setback. The immediate benefit of the \nrecovery program is the reinstatement of basic services, including water and power supply, \ntransport sector functionality\u2014safe road and maritime access, education and health sector \nservices  countrywide\u2013\u2013all  crucial  services  underpinning  the  minimum  socioeconomic \nstandards  in  the  outer  islands  and  economic  welfare  of  Rarotonga  communities.  In \nRarotonga, restoration of roads, bridges, and water supplies is essential to the economic \nwell-being of the country, particularly ensuring immediate restoration of the tourism sector\u2013\u2013\nthe main source of employment and income. In the outer islands, infrastructure is essential \nfor delivering services to poor and disadvantaged groups. Selected recovery activities will be \ntechnically feasible, cost-effective, and represent a least-cost alternative with appropriate \nadjustment for cyclone-resistant design.  \n \n73.  While an economic impact assessment has not been conducted at this stage, the \nimmediate economic impacts are expected to be temporary and relate to the (i) opportunity \ncosts carried by both public and private outlays to finance recovery that redirects funding \nfrom productive assets to the rebuilding activity; (ii) lost revenues in the interim when private \nand public services are not functional with related employment and socioeconomic impacts; \nand (iii) temporary loss of agricultural production, with impact on inflation, productivity, and \neconomic growth. These are offset to some extent by the labor intensity of the recovery \nphase and an estimated additional 60,000 labor-days, or 6% addition to overall employment, \nparticularly in the construction industries. While the country\u2019s inflation has been low, the \nlosses  in  agricultural  production  with  the  corresponding  increase  in  food  imports  are \nexpected to contribute to inflationary pressure. With supply-side shortages characterizing \nlabor and materials markets, the additional demand, particularly on labor and construction \nmaterials, can be expected to result in wage and profit increases leading to further inflation. ", "  17\nRegretfully, the inflationary trend impacts most harshly on the poor. Finally, migration away \nfrom the outer islands and to international destinations, both long and short term, is expected \nto increase. \n \n74.  The Project supports prudent financial management of Government fiscal resources, \nenabling  maintenance of  fiscal  viability  and  debt  servicing  by  maximizing  concessional \nfunding for recovery expenditures. With the Project\u2019s support, the Government will be able to  \nmaintain  macroeconomic  performance  in  accordance  with  the  1998  Manila  Agreement \nfinancial ratios.16 This, in turn, will enable the Government to continue with its objectives of \nattaining the Millennium Development Goals and improving standards of living in the Cook \nIslands. The Project is expected to contribute to a favorable resolution of the credit check by \ncredit-rating agencies and continue attracting repatriated, international, and domestic private \nsector investment, particularly to the tourism sector, and thus fuel growth and employment. \n \n75.  Tourism. Tourism generates 54% of the GDP and is the main export earner with \nmajor  markets  in  Australia  and  New  Zealand.  While  extreme  weather  events  may  not \nsignificantly affect total tourist arrivals, the economy is highly vulnerable to strong cyclones \nthat can inflict damage on tourism infrastructure, such as hotels, mostly located along \ncoastal areas. Cyclone-motivated reservation cancellations and deferment was temporary \nand estimated at 20% of the expected hotel occupancy, with March 2005 reservations \nindicating recovery. Local commercial banks are extending tourism businesses cyclone-\nrelated, debt-rescheduling packages that include working capital, rescheduling of loan terms, \ninterest capitalization, and grace periods for amortization and interest payments. Restoration \ninvestment and the associated revenue losses are estimated to reach NZ$10 million and \nNZ$5  million,  respectively,  with  about  70%  of  these  funded  through  external  cyclone \ninsurance.17 In addition, Rarotonga was not able to receive four planned cruise ship calls at \nAvatiu port, and experienced an associated reduction in total revenues for cruise ship calls \nby a minimum of NZ$240,000.18 While tourism is characterized as resilient, the future cost \nand availability of cyclone and sea surge insurance and the diminished capacity of the Cook \nIslands to attract long-haul tourist markets in Europe and North America are areas of \nconcern.  \n \n76.  Agriculture. About 70% of all households are engaged in agricultural activity, either \nsubsistence and/or commercial. The tourism sector is an important market outlet for locally \ngrown produce. With agriculture currently contributing about 7.1% of the country's GDP, the \nMinistry of Agriculture is researching new varieties of fruit and vegetables, and is initiating \nprojects to revive the citrus, banana, and pineapple-growing industries. Loss of planted \nagriculture production ranges from 100% in Pukapuka and Nassau, to 50% in Aitutaki and \nRarotonga. In Pukapuka, the island population was left totally dependent on imported food \nand water. In Rarotonga, significant increases in food imports have become necessary due \nto a partial loss of hydroponic vegetable production that primarily caters to the hotels. \nAgriculture GDP is expected to be affected with a temporary loss (6\u20134 months) affecting \n78% of arable land with an income loss estimated at 26%, or about NZ$4.4 million.  \n \n77.  Fisheries. Pearl farming, fishing, and agriculture generate the remainder of GDP. \nFisheries,  particularly  offshore  fishing  industries,  grew  fast  from  nearly  nothing  since \n2002/03. However, after some early success, setbacks have related to inconsistency in \nquantity of catch required for commercial viability. The Cook Islands also receives about \nNZ$1 million a year from tuna fishing access fees. The impact of cyclones on marine \nfisheries was mostly due to loss of fishing days.  \n                                                 \n16  See the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \n17  Cyclone, including sea surge coverage, insurance is generally required by commercial creditors.  \n18  Each 600-passenger cruise ship brings a total revenue, including port duties, restaurant, and other retail \nservices ranging from NZ$60,000 to NZ$100,000, totaling an estimated revenue loss of NZ$240,000 for the \nfour calls.  ", "18  \nB.  Poverty and Other Impacts \n78.  Poverty Impact. Natural disasters affect the poor disproportionately in terms of \nhealth, housing, employment, livelihood, and food security. In this case, residents of the \nremote outer islands have damaged housing and food crops. Damage to port facilities has  \nrestricted the delivery of essential supplies, particularly food and fuel. While the Project will \nnot directly address private housing or agriculture, it will assist the poor by restoring port \nservices, rural infrastructure, and community infrastructure facilities. \n \n79.  Social Impacts. In 2001,19 the country had a population of 15,017; 5,560 lived on the \nouter islands. The cyclones affected Atiu with a resident population of 600, Aitutaki 1,743, \nMangaia 739, Mauke 469, Mitiaro 226, Nassau 72, Palmerston 48, Pukapuka 662, and \nRarotonga 9,451. The most serious social impacts are being experienced by Pukapuka and \nNassau, where most of the population lost functionality of their homes and agricultural \nproduction,  particularly  the  food  staple\u2014taro,  which  was  partly  destroyed,  leaving  the \ncommunity dependent on food imports, thus exacerbating hardship and poverty. In the other \nislands, partial damage to homes was common. Countrywide, but particularly in the outer \nislands,  recovery  of  homes  will  absorb  the  limited  savings  and  exacerbate  economic \ndifficulties and hardship. In Rarotonga, commercial banks are funding residential recovery \nwith  softer  than  usual  terms,  thus  reallocating  financing  from  home  purchase  and \nimprovement to refurbishment.  \n \n80.  Employment  Generation.  The  recovery  activities  funded  under  the  Project  are \nestimated  to  generate  about  60,000  person-days  of  employment,  mostly  in  the \nreconstruction and repair of infrastructure. The poverty reduction aspects will be enhanced \nby contractors using local workers in unskilled and semiskilled tasks. \n \nC.  Resettlement \n81.  The Project will not involve land acquisition or resettlement of any kind as recovery \nactivities are concerned only with restoration of existing facilities. The Project is focused on \nreinstatement of services and facilities to their precyclone condition using cyclone-resistant \ndesigns, where technically feasible, particularly for the benefit of indigenous Cook Islanders, \nespecially in the outer islands. The Project involves no negative impacts on indigenous \npeoples. \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n82.  The Project is classified as category B in accordance with ADB Environment Policy \n(2002). The initial environmental examination (IEE), including the environment management \nplan,  was  conducted  to  determine  the  degree  of  likely  impacts  and  describe  possible \nmitigation  measures.  The  Project  involves  only  rehabilitation  of  previously  existing \ninfrastructure previously or currently used for the same purpose. The IEE concluded that the \nProject is unlikely to generate any significant environmental impact either during construction \nor  during  operation.  All  recovery  activities  will  be  required  to  complete  and  satisfy  an \nenvironmental assessment screening checklist during formulation. Recommended mitigation \nmeasures  will  be  incorporated  in  the  design  of  subprojects  and  contractors\u2019  work \nassignments. Positive impacts will arise from the restoration of water supplies and sanitation \nfacilities, clearing of debris in general, and adoption of cyclone-resistant designs, where \npossible. The summary IEE is in Appendix 8. \n \n                                                 \n19 Government of the Cook Islands. 2001. Census of Population and Dwelling. Statistics Office. Ratotonga. Since \n2001, an estimated 2,000 Cook Islanders have migrated from the country.  ", "  19\nE.  Risks \n \n83.  The risks related to efficient and prudent management of quick-disbursing recovery \nresources, including corruption and misuse of funds for purposes not related to the recovery \nphase,  are  addressed  by  (i)  established  and  agreed  detailed  selection  criteria;  (ii) \ntransparent implementation and monitoring mechanisms, involving a group of implementing \nagencies in decision making; (iii) engagement of adequate human resources for project \nmanagement, including for safeguarding financial accounting and control of expenditures \nunder the loan; and (iv) external audit of the accounts. \n  \n84.  A 24-month implementation period is sufficient given action already under way under \nthe recovery program for which retroactive funding is available under the Project and the \nstreamlined project management procedures. \n \n  \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \n85.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Recovery  activity  selection  and  eligibility  criteria.  The  Government  will \nensure that all recovery activities carried out under the Project meet, to the \nsatisfaction  of  ADB,  the  agreed  general  and  specific  eligibility  criteria  and \nimplementation arrangements, and that all such recovery activities are properly \ncontrolled and monitored to the satisfaction of ADB.  \n \n(ii)  The Government will evaluate each activity proposed for financing under the \nProject in accordance with the agreed eligibility criteria and will submit all such \nproposals to ADB for approval. Each financing proposal will include (a) a detailed \ndescription of the proposed design; (b) an account of the Government\u2019s use of its \nbudget reserves and its efforts to obtain external grant financing for such activity, \nif applicable; (c) a description of the proposed procurement methodology; (d) the \nfinancial disbursement plan, including the proposed timing of disbursements; (e) \nan environmental assessment and mitigation plan prepared in accordance with \nGovernment and ADB environmental requirements; (f) a description of the extent \nand nature of beneficiary consultations and the results of such consultations; (g) \nperformance  monitoring  indicators  and  targets  as  integrated  into  the \nGovernment\u2019s recovery activity application or quarterly reports of the PMU, as \napplicable;  and  (h)  intended  date  for  the  submission  of  a  compliance  and \ncompletion certificate for such activity. \n \n(iii)  Operation  and  maintenance.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  facilities \nrestored  under  the  Project  are  operated  and  maintained  by  the  responsible \nimplementing agency in accordance with sound policies and practices. In order to \nfacilitate proper maintenance of project facilities, the Government will devise a \ndetailed and comprehensive maintenance plan for such project facilities and the \nplan will be incorporated into the final project completion report. \n \n(iv)  Counterpart funds. The Government will allocate, on a timely basis, adequate \ncounterpart funds from its budget in accordance with its comprehensive recovery \nassessment and program. \n \n(v)  Environment and resettlement. The Government will ensure that the Project is \ncarried out and all project facilities are operated and maintained in accordance \nwith (a) the Environment Act 2003 and all other existing laws, regulations, and ", "20  \nstandards  of  the  Government  concerning  environmental  protection;  (b)  ADB \nEnvironment Policy (2002); and (c) all environmental mitigation measures set out \nin  the  IEE,  including  the  environment  management  plan,  for  each  project \ncomponent.  The  Government  will  also  ensure  that  the  mitigation  measures \nidentified  by  the  IEEs  are  incorporated  into  the  design,  rehabilitation,  and \noperation of the project facilities, as applicable. \n \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that no land acquisition or involuntary resettlement \nwill be required for the Project. In the event that land acquisition or involuntary \nresettlement is required, the Government will prepare a resettlement plan in \naccordance with applicable Government laws and regulations and ADB Policy on \nInvoluntary Resettlement (1995).20 Any such resettlement plan will be submitted \nto ADB for review and approval before any resettlement activities are initiated. \n \n(vii)  Good  governance.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any possible financial management or perceived impropriety \nin  implementing  the  Project. The Government,  together with MFEM  and  the \nrelevant  implementing  agencies,  will  agree  to  cooperate  with  any  such \ninvestigation and extend all necessary assistance, including access to all relevant \nbooks and records as well as the engagement of independent experts, who may \nbe needed to complete any such investigations in a satisfactory manner. All \nexternal costs related to any such investigation by ADB will be borne by the \nProject. \n \n(viii)  The Government will ensure that the PMU establishes a website for the Project to \nprovide  information  on  how  project  funds  are  being  used  for  the  intended \nbeneficiaries. The project website will include information on project activities, an \nupdate on the timing of project activities, and an analysis of the social and \neconomic impacts of the Project. The project website will also present financial \nstatements;  track  procurement  contract  awards;  and  include  information  on, \namong others, the list of participating bidders, name of the winning bidder, basic \ndetails on bidding procedures adopted, amount of the contract awarded, and list \nof goods and/or services purchased and their intended and actual utilization. The \nGovernment will also ensure that MFEM and the implementing agencies actively \ndisseminate information, through the use of local media and other appropriate \nmeans, on the use of project funds to beneficiaries who do not have access to \nthe project website. \n \n(ix)  Midterm review. The Government and ADB will, 1 year after the effective date \nfor the Project, jointly carry out a comprehensive midterm review of the Project. \nThe  midterm  review  will  assess  the  Project\u2019s  achievements  and  progress in \nimplementing  the  project  objectives  to  identify  any  difficulties  or  constraints \nencountered in project implementation and to make adjustments, if necessary, for \nthe remaining project implementation period. Specifically, the midterm review will \nassess  the  adequacy  of  funds,  any  cost  overruns,  and  any  reallocation \nrequirements.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n20  ADB. 1998.

Meena.  Cyclone  Meena,  with  a  maximum  severity  rating  of  category  5,  began  in \nAmerican Samoa, with the eye of the cyclone moving in an easterly direction. Gaining strength, \nMeena entered the Cook Islands\u2019 territory on 4 February 2005 and passed 145 kilometers (km) \nnortheast of Palmerston, 161 km west of Aitutaki, and 90 km northeast of Rarotonga on 6 \nFebruary. Meena then moved south toward Mangaia. The winds reached 100 km per hour (kph) \non Rarotonga. Wave surges caused substantial damage to the commercial district of Avarua, \ncapital of the Cook Islands. The waves demolished buildings along the waterfront, left rubble \nstrewn on the main road, and damaged the road to the airport, causing road closures. In \nAitutaki, the cyclone caused damage to power supply, the port, and buildings, particularly \nAraura College. In Mauke, the cyclone caused serious damage to the port, whereas in Mangaia, \nhigh winds and rough seas affected the airport, water supply, roads, buildings, and the wharf. \nThe National Emergency Operations Centre reported no casualties throughout the archipelago.  \n2.  Nancy. A second cyclone, Nancy, followed Meena on 13 February and passed 112 km \nsouthwest of Suwarrow, with the center advancing at 148 kph and causing gale-force winds with \nsqually thunderstorms on Palmerston. Aitutaki experienced high seas and strong winds of 95\u2013\n145 kph, with heavy rain. Nancy passed Rarotonga at 50 km on 15 February, with destructive \nwind  gusts  felling  many  trees  and  power  lines,  leaving  more  than  800  customers  without \nelectricity, rendering the main roads impassable owing to debris, and destroying the roofs of a \nnumber  of  buildings  (schools,  churches,  restaurants).  The  cyclone  curled  around  to  the \nsouthwest of Rarotonga, with gusts of up to 140 kph recorded. In Atiu, Nancy reached winds of \nup to 241 kph and brought down power lines, poles, and trees; ripped off roofs; and spread \ndebris on the roads. The strong winds and rain left the majority of houses with water damage. \nThe  country's  southernmost  island,  Mangaia,  experienced  strong  gusts  of  up  to  259  kph, \ninflicting damage on all infrastructure.   \n3.  Olaf.  A  third  cyclone,  Olaf,  merged  with  Nancy,  and  reached  the  west  coast  of \nRarotonga on 17 February, with winds of 259 kph and gusts of 315 kph. Olaf lifted roofs of \nresidences  and  business  establishments,  brought  down  trees,  and  left  households  without \npower or phone connections. Olaf caused storm surges, damaging structures along the coast. \nWhen Olaf\u2019s eye passed 200 km west of Rarotonga, its winds reached 285 kph and it was given \na severity rating of category 4. Reports from outer islands, including Aitutaki and Palmerston, \nrecorded sea surges and wind damage, but no injuries. \n 4.  Percy. A fourth cyclone, Percy, with a maximum severity rating of category 5, severely \naffected the low-lying, fragile, and remote atolls of Pukapuka (population 640) and Nassau \n(population 72) located 1,140 km north of Rarotonga on 27 February 2005. The eye of the \ncyclone passed 40 km south of Pukapuka, with the wind gusts estimated at 230 kph. Percy \ncaused damage to most buildings in Pukapuka, including the hospital, school, and churches, \nand rendered the roads inaccessible owing to strewn debris and fallen trees. No fatalities or \ninjuries were reported. Nassau, located 57 km southwest of Pukapuka, was also severely hit by \nPercy, which damaged all houses and left only the church, with a torn roof, standing. Women \nand young children were evacuated from the island until recovery action was completed. Percy \npassed 200 km southwest of Palmerston, with winds of at least 37 kph and gusts up to 56 kph, \nwith no serious damage reported. \n5.  Rae. A fifth cyclone, Rae, was minimal and passed 320 km southwest of Rarotonga. It \nstayed at tropical storm strength without escalating to hurricane level. However, warnings for \nlocalized flash floods were raised by Fiji Regional Meteological Service Centre on Rarotonga \nand Mangaia islands.

Rationale \n \n1.  Between 4 February and 8 March 2005, the Cook Islands experienced five damaging \ncyclones, four of which were assigned a category 5 severity rating and caused damage to \nhomes  and  essential  public  infrastructure.  The  economy  was  severely  disrupted.  The \nGovernment  and  its  agencies  have  managed  early  warning  information  dissemination  and \nevacuation,  and  provided  emergency  relief  to  the  affected  population  with  the  support  of \ninternational and regional relief agencies. Preliminary assessments of the physical damage \nhave been carried out. However, the Government lacks capacity and resources to finance the \nimmediate recovery and reinstatement of basic services.   \n \n2.  The  emergency  highlights  the  need  for  a  long-term  strategy  and  an  integrated \ninfrastructure development plan that (i) incorporates climate change adaptation concepts; and \n(ii)  prioritizes  the  development  and  implementation  of  policies  and  measures  to  support \neconomic and social development, and ensure maintenance of basic infrastructure against \nweather-related threats.  \n \n3.  The social infrastructure is ill-prepared for weather-related threats; this was highlighted \nby the Climate Change Adaptation Project for the Pacific.1 The inherent geographic vulnerability \nof the Cook Islands to climate change can be ameliorated by integrated infrastructure and social \ndevelopment,  including  human  resource  development.  The  country  needs  to  be  \u201cclimate \nproofed\u201d  by  enhancing  its  adaptive  capacity  and  resilience  to  climate  change  and  climate \nvariability,  including  extreme  events.  Strengthening  disaster  management  and  mitigation \ncapacity will help to (i) ensure that future social and infrastructure program designs incorporate \nclimate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, thus allowing delivery of the envisaged \nbenefits to the community; and (ii) disaster management capacity includes the ability to mobilize \na robust and rapid response to minimize impact on the fragile economy.   \n \nB.  Objectives \n \n4.  The objectives of the technical assistance (TA) are to (i) assist the Government in \nstrengthening  disaster  and  recovery  management,  including  damage  assessment,  aid \nmanagement,  and  operational  coordination;  and  (ii)  establish  financial  controls  required  to \nensure  good  governance  in  managing  rapid  disbursement  of  recovery  funds.  The  TA  will \ndevelop a far-reaching and systematic approach to mitigating the country\u2019s vulnerability to \nadverse  weather  conditions  under  three  phases\u2014emergency  response,  recovery,  and  the \ndevelopment  or  establishment  of  institutions  and  environmentally  sustainable  infrastructure \ncapable of preventing the recurrence of disasters. The TA will establish (i) robust disaster \nmanagement operations and control mechanisms to support not only the efficient and effective \nimplementation of the Cyclone Emergency Assistance Project, but future disasters as well; and \n(ii)  a  preventive  master  plan  that  will  develop  long-term  preparedness  by  minimizing  the \npotential harmful impacts of future emergencies. \n                                                           \n1  ADB. 2002.

Introduction \n \n1.  The initial environmental examination (IEE) provides basic information about the general \nenvironmental  settings  of  the  proposed  interventions,  their  potential  impacts,  magnitude, \ndistribution, and possible affected groups. These are presented according to the different project \nphases, i.e., from site assessment and design to construction, to operation and maintenance. \nMitigation measures are prescribed, together with the proposed environmental monitoring plan, \ninstitutional requirements, and public consultation and information disclosure requirements. The \nIEE procedure follows the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Environment Policy (2002) and \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003).  \n \nB.  Description of Project \n \n2.  The  Cyclone  Emergency  Assistance  Project  intends  to  fast  track  the  recovery  and \nrehabilitation of damaged public services and in the process lessen the adverse social and \neconomic impact of the cyclones. The Project will finance a major part of the cyclone recovery \nprogram to restore the functionality of public utilities (such as water and power), education, \nhealth, and transport sector services. Specifically, the Project will (i) repair and clean up roads, \nbridges, and drainage, particularly in Rarotonga; Aitutaki; Mauke; and Mangaia; (ii) restore the \nfunctionality of harbors in Aitutaki, Mangaia, Mauke, Pukapuka, and  Rarotonga,; (iii) repair the \npower distribution lines and infrastructure in Aitutaki and Rarotonga; (iv) reinstate the water \nsupply facilities to their precyclone condition, particularly in Pukapuka and Nassau; (v) restore \nthe newly constructed waste management landfill in Rarotonga; and (vi) repair hospitals, health \ncenters, staff quarters, and administrative buildings of government agencies. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n  1.  Physical Resources \n \n3.  The Cook Islands has a tropical oceanic climate with two seasons. The drier months, \nfrom April to November, have an average maximum temperature of about 26 degrees Celsius \n(oC) and an average minimum temperature of about 20oC. The wetter, more humid months, \nfrom December to March, have an average maximum temperature of 28oC and an average \nminimum of 22oC. During the wet season, the Cook Islands can experience severe tropical \ncyclones. Water supply in Rarotonga is obtained from the water catchments of the mountainous \ninterior of the island. The main sources of drinking water in the other volcanic southern group \nislands are freshwater lenses and through roof catchments. The main source of drinking water \nin the northern atolls is from rainwater tanks and cisterns because the groundwater resource is \nprone to contamination from human waste and salt intrusion. \n \n2.  Ecological Resources \n \n4.  Biodiversity of the country includes a variety of plants and animal species. Rarotonga \nhas 180 indigenous flowering plants, the Makatea islands have 90 to 100 indigenes, Aitutaki has \n40, and the northern atolls vary from 25 in Pukapuka to 18 on Manihiki. The plants of the Cook \nIslands are widely used by the people. The Natural Heritage Project has documented over \n1,007 flowering plants, of which 163 are used for food, 73 for medicines, 52 for agriculture or \nhorticulture, 20 provide timber, and 406 are ornamental (leaves or flowers). Birds include about \n20 indigenous resident seabirds and 13 indigenous resident land birds. Six Alaskan shorebirds ", "    Appendix 8  43\nregularly spend the southern winter in the country. Two of the uninhabited islands, Takutea in \nthe southern island group and Suwarrow in the northern group, play an important ecological role \nas bird sanctuaries, both supporting species not found elsewhere in the Cook Islands. Twenty-\nfour coral genera and 58 species have been identified in the Cook Islands mainly on Aitutaki \nand Rarotonga. Coral reef resources and lagoons provide a very important food source for Cook \nislanders, particularly in the northern island group and also on some islands of the southern \ngroup. \n \n3.  Economic Development \n \n5.  Despite the Cook Islands\u2019 economic vulnerability, it achieved its sixth consecutive year \nof growth in 2004. Real gross domestic product grew by 3.4% over fiscal year (FY) 2004; its \nprimary  contributors  are  tourism  (54%),  including  the  related  retail,  wholesale,  and  other \nconsumption and financial services; agriculture and fisheries (16%); transportation (15%); and \npublic administration (12%). Tourism, the leading economic sector, has grown massively since \n1971. In 2000, a record of 75,000 people visited the country, bringing huge economic benefits \nand major developments in tourist infrastructure on both Rarotonga and the northern island of \nAitutaki. Fisheries also contribute substantially to the economy: every week, up to 20 tons of fish \nwere exported to markets in Japan and the United States (US). Cook Islands boats caught \nabout 846 tons of tuna worth about US$3.1 million (gross). The Cook Islands also receives \nabout US$1 million a year from a fishing treaty that allows a certain number of US tuna fishing \nboats to operate in the country\u2019s exclusive economic zone each year. Black pearls are the Cook \nIslands\u2019 leading export, ranking second to tourism in their importance to the  economy. The \nlargest market is Japan which buys about 50% of Cook Islands\u2019 production. The remainder is  \nAustralia, Europe, Hawaii, and domestic markets. About 70% of all households in the Cook \nIslands are engaged in some form of agricultural activity for subsistence, commercial, or both. \nSome agricultural produce is exported to New Zealand.  \n \n4.  Social and Cultural Resources \n \n6.  The indigenous population of the Cook Islands is the Cook Islands Maori, Polynesians \nclosely related ethnically to the indigenous populations of Tahiti and nearby islands and to the \nNew  Zealand  Maori.  The  population  of  the  Cook  Islands  in  2003  was  18,027.  Since  the \neconomic reform programs of 1995\u20131996, the population has experienced heavy losses due to \nmigration to Australia and New Zealand. Settlements are mainly concentrated on the coastal \nzone. Broad social indicators place the Cook Islands toward the top in the Pacific in literacy \nrates and school enrolment ratios. Life expectancy, infant mortality rates, and access to safe \nwater and sanitation compare well with Pacific neighbors. Access to and quality of social service \nprovision in Rarotonga differs significantly from that on the outer islands. Of the approximately \n28 primary schools in the Cook Islands, 10 are in Rarotonga, and out of the 23 schools offering \nsecondary level education, 3 are in Rarotonga. Postsecondary education facilities, however, are \nlimited and are based mainly in Rarotonga, such as the extension center of the University of the \nSouth Pacific in Avarua.  \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n7.  The  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  help  the  Cook  Islands  recover  from  the \ndevastation wrought by five cyclones that hit the country between February and March 2005. \nTable A8 presents the potential adverse impact that rehabilitation and construction works may \npose  for  the  environment,  particularly  on  the  quality  of  the  air,  water,  soil,  wildlife,  and \n ", "44  Appendix 8 \nvegetation, as well as the impact on the social and cultural makeup of the local people. Project \ncompletion is expected to bring social and economic benefits to local residents. \n \n8.  Because the project activities are generally repair works, environmental impacts are \npredicted to be limited. The identified potential environmental impacts on the air, water, lands, \nvegetation, wildlife, and the local people, are manageable and could be mitigated as outlined in \nTable A8. The project management unit (PMU) staff will oversee and monitor the progress of \nproject  construction  and  operational  activities.  The  PMU  will  have  full  support  from  the \nGovernment, particularly the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management (MFEM) and the \nNational Environment Service.  \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring \n \n  1.  Institutional Requirements \n \n9.  MFEM will be the Executing Agency for the Project, with the Ministry of Works, Cook \nIsland  Investment  Corporation  including  the  Ports  Authority  and  Te  Aponga  Uira  Power \nAuthority (Rarotonga), and Office of the Minister for Island Administrations as implementing \nagencies. A PMU, guided by a steering committee, will be created to administer and coordinate \ndaily project activities. The PMU, headed by a project manager, will oversee overall project \nimplementation,. The PMU will ensure that project operations are within the environmental \nstandards set by the IEE and other appropriate policies, rules, and regulations set by the \nGovernment. Environmental monitoring and evaluation of project activities will be undertaken by \na multipartite monitoring team comprising representatives from the PMU, MFEM, and technical \nstaff from the National Environment Service. Representative(s) from affected communities will \nbe selected to form part of the monitoring team. ADB may join the monitoring team as a \ntechnical adviser. Other experts from outside organizations may be included as needed. \n \n2.  Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n10.  During the preconstruction phase, the focus of monitoring and evaluation will be the \ndesign and location of various project rehabilitation and repair activities. The monitoring team \nwill ensure that the designs incorporate all the mitigating measures identified, to limit, if not \ntotally  eliminate,  the  possible  negative  impact  of  project  construction  activities.  Mitigating \nmeasures should include the concerns and requirements of the local communities. With the \nmitigating  measures  already  defined  and  parameters  listed,  the  monitoring  team  will  then \nconduct regular inspection activities. Monitoring may be done 6 months immediately after the \ncommencement of construction and other related activities. This will be regularized (either on a \nmonthly or quarterly basis) depending on the need of the Project and requirements of MFEM \nand ADB. The team will conduct an annual evaluation. If the construction activities cause an \nunfavorable environmental condition, the monitoring team, through the PMU, will notify the \nsteering committee, which will advise on appropriate action.  \n \nF.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n \n11.  The ADB Damage Assessment Mission held from 11\u201317 March 2005 identified the \nurgency of undertaking rehabilitation of damaged areas. Consultations with Government officials \nconcerned, affected local communities, and representatives from aid partners have confirmed \nthat delay in the rehabilitation work would result in more harm to the ailing economy. The local \npopulace  is  in  dire  need  of  public  services  such  as  roads,  transport,  safe  water,  power, ", "    Appendix 8  45\ntelecommunication, hospitals, and schools. Reestablishing services would hasten the return of \ncommunities to their normal life and performance of their usual social and economic activities. \n \n12.  In designing the rehabilitation activities and conduct of actual construction works, care \nmust be taken that the concerns of local people are incorporated in the plans and programs of \nactivities. Further consultations will be conducted during construction to ensure that their needs \nand requirements are considered. Representatives from the local communities will be invited to \nform part of the monitoring and evaluation team to examine overall project implementation.  \n \nG.  Findings, Recommendations, and Conclusion \n \n13.  The project activities are mainly clean up and repair and rehabilitation in scope, while \nnew construction activities (if any) will be very minimal. These activities are expected to pose \nnegligible  impact  on  the  environment,  and  are  tolerable  depending  on  adherence  to  the \nmitigating measures defined. Implementation and subsequent completion of project activities \nwould even result in more benefits, both socially and economically, for Cook Islanders.  \n \n14.  No  component  activities  of  the  Project  will  require  a  full  environmental  impact \nassessment, and therefore, the Project may proceed as planned, and the identified mitigating \nmeasures be duly observed during construction and operation and maintenance phases of \nproject implementation. This IEE can therefore be considered as the required environmental \nassessment for the project and no follow-up environmental impact assessment is needed. \n \n ", " \n4\n6\n \nTable A8: Summary of
