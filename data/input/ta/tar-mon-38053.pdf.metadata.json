During  consultations  for  the  country  strategy  and  program  update  in  2003,  the \nGovernment of Mongolia requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide advisory \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  conducting  participatory  poverty  assessment  and  monitoring \n(PPAM) that will help update and monitor the economic growth support and poverty reduction \nstrategy (EGSPRS).1 The proposed project was subsequently included in the 2004 TA program \nduring the May Country Programming Mission. PPAM will complement and update an earlier \nparticipatory living standard assessment conducted in 1999, and assist the Government and \ncivil society to develop qualitative monitoring mechanisms for the EGSPRS. In January 2004, \nthe National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS) Committee endorsed the TA concept for \nfunding  from  the  Cooperation  Fund  in  Support  of  the  Formulation  and  Implementation  of \nNational Poverty Reduction Strategies (NPRS Fund) administered by ADB.  A Fact-Finding \nMission was fielded in June 2004 to obtain an understanding of the objectives, scope, activities, \nfinancing requirements, implementation arrangements, and outcomes for the proposed TA on \nthe PPAM.2 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  most  reliable  data  on  poverty  trends  in  Mongolia  are  derived  from  the  living \nstandards measurement survey (LSMS) first conducted by the National Statistics Office (NSO) \nin 1995 with World Bank support and repeated in 1998 with support from the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP). Over this period, the poverty head count remained more or \nless unchanged at about 36%. The survey also showed that poverty was concentrated in \nprovincial centers, towns, and other urban settlements.  Although the level of poverty has not \nsignificantly risen during 1994\u20132000, the depth of poverty has increased and income inequality \nhas  worsened.3  The  NSO,  with  support  from  the  World  Bank,  conducted  an  expanded \nhousehold income and expenditure/living standard measurement survey (HIES/LSMS) in 2002. \nThe survey results will be published in the third quarter of 2004. The LSMSs conducted in 1995 \nand 1998 remain the most reliable sources of quantitative data on poverty in Mongolia.  \n \n3.  In 1999 NSO, with support from international agencies such as the World Bank, UNDP, \nUnited Nations Children's Fund, and ADB, conducted a participatory living standard assessment \n(PLSA) in selected urban and rural areas. The PLSA provided a better understanding of poverty \nand to some degree improved the link between poverty diagnosis and pro-poor policy making by \nensuring that the voices of poor people themselves are heard and acted upon. The PLSA \nindicated that distinct population segments, the \u201crich\" and the \"poor,\u201d emerged during the 1990s, \nand  the  gap  between  the two groups has continued to widen. The PLSA report provided \nvaluable information for the preparation of the EGSPRS: analysis of livelihood sources and \nstrategies, emergence of multiple sources of insecurity and vulnerability, broader dimensions of \nwell-being besides income and asset holdings, and people\u2019s perceptions of the main factors \naffecting their living standards.4 The EGSPRS recommended that further participation of the \npoor should be sought in the process of improving the EGSPRS and ensuring its sustainable \nimplementation. Participatory processes will be an integral part of the planning, implementation, \nand evaluation of the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy. Hence, there is a need to gather \n                                                 \n1  The Government approved the EGSPRS in 2003. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 10 February 2004. \n3 The Gini coefficient increased from 0.31 to 0.35 in 1998; however, it remains relatively low by international \nstandards. \n4  National Statistical Office of Mongolia and the World Bank. 2001.  Mongolia Participatory Living Standards \nAssessment. Mongolia. ", "2 \nqualitative information on the changes and establish participatory poverty monitoring within the \ncountry.  \n  \n4.  Economic, demographic, and social changes in Mongolia since 1999 suggest that the \nPLSA needs to be revisited. A series of severe winters and droughts from 1999 to 2001 spurred \nrapid migration to cities, particularly to Ulaanbaatar, as households lost their livestock and \nhence their only means of support in the countryside. The population in Ulaanbaatar increased \nby 27.5% between 1999 and 2003, as many families came in search of better education, \nemployment opportunities, and health services. At current rates of internal migration, half the \npopulation of Mongolia will live in Ulaanbaatar by 2010. Mongolia has also experienced rapid \ngrowth in the informal sector, which accounts for the livelihood strategies of most of the poor. In \n2003, the  Parliament adopted  a new Regional Development Strategy  (RDS) and Regional \nDevelopment Law,  to promote economic growth outside Ulaanbaatar.  The RDS divides the \ncountry into five economic regions, each with one or two cities selected as \u201cgrowth pillars\u201d which \nwill receive infrastructure investments in the hope that this will discourage people from moving \nto Ulaanbaatar. An ADB TA evaluated the new strategy and concluded that while the objective \nof geographically balanced growth  is laudable, selection of regional growth pillar cities is an \nadministrative decision that needs to be reexamined in light of the socioeconomic status of the \npopulation.5 Infrastructure investments alone may not be sufficient to encourage growth in an \neconomy now dominated by private entrepreneurs. Understanding the needs and aspirations of \npeople, especially the poor, is crucial in formulating such strategies. In sum,  dramatic changes \nin the economy, demographic shifts, new policies, and the adoption of the EGSPRS argue for a \nnew qualitative poverty assessment. \n \n5.  In light of the rapid economic changes in the past 5 years, livelihoods have become \nmore diverse and complex, often combining opportunities in rural areas with those in urban \ncenters.    Many  other  forms  of  interhousehold  transfer,  together  with  pensions  and  state \nallowances, also emerged as crucial to the survival of poor households in urban centers. PPAM \nwill (i) assess changes in perceived levels of well-being for the period 1999\u20132004, differentiated \nby gender, age, and location; (ii) analyze in detail livelihood sources and strategies; and (iii) \nexamine the interdependence of urban and rural localities, particularly in the context of plans to \npromote regional development.   \n \n6.  PPAM can also serve as a tool for self-assessment, enabling stakeholders, including \nwomen and vulnerable groups, to reflect on past experience, and examine present realities. \nEncouraging stakeholder participation beyond data gathering, PPAM will promote local decision \nmaking and problem solving  \u2013 thereby strengthening people\u2019s capacities to take action and \npromote changes. PPAM will attempt to contribute to new forms of governance, involving \ngreater  transparency  and  more  democratic  involvement  between  citizens  and  the  broader \ninstitutions that affect their lives.6 \n \n7.  The TA will be used to monitor the implementation of the EGSPRS and to provide \nfeedback to policy makers and other key stakeholders on program effectiveness, particularly in \nmeeting the needs of people at the grassroots level.  In addition, it will offer methodological \ncomplementarity to enrich the quantitative poverty data and advance more substantial causal \nexplanations that in turn can generate better monitoring of the poverty reduction strategy.  \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2002.

", "    3 \nFurthermore, PPAM will allow a deeper analysis of issues that LSMS methodology is not well-\nequipped to address, including non-income poverty measures, poverty dynamics over time, and \nspatial dynamics in livelihood strategies (footnote 4). There is a critical need to build better links \nbetween quantitative and qualitative assessment.   \n \n8.  Recognizing the need for in-house poverty monitoring capacity, the Government has \nestablished the Poverty Research Group (PRG), based in the Ministry of Finance and Economy \n(MOFE), to coordinate different data sources on poverty, and monitor the overall progress of the \nEGSPRS. PRG\u2019s success will require strong interinstitutional dialogue and coordination with \nother  ministries  or  agencies,  NSO,  local  governments,  and  civil  society  working  groups \nestablished  during  the  preparation  of  the  EGSPRS.  Implementing  the  EGSPRS,  including \nestablishing links and relationships with other institutions with similar mandates, will also require \ncapacity building and coordination among the relevant agencies and departments, aid agencies, \nand civil society organizations.  \n \n9.  The TA will be implemented in collaboration with the World Bank, particularly in selecting \nproject areas for PPAM. The TA will focus on regional centers  identified  in  the RDS and \nassociated law, and rural areas, while the World Bank will concentrate on the urban and peri-\nurban areas of Ulaanbaatar. In addition, the TA will coordinate closely with the World Bank to \nprepare  questionnaires,  methods  and  tools,  and  training  programs.  The  TA  will  assist \nGovernment to (i) develop qualitative indicators and tools for regular monitoring and evaluation; \n(ii) strengthen the capacity of NSO, PRG and other key stakeholders to monitor and evaluate \nprogress towards economic growth enhancement and poverty reduction; and (iii) strengthen \nlocal capacity to carry out PPAM in the future.   \n \n10.  From ADB\u2019s perspective, the TA will (i) build on previous ADB interventions as indicated \nin the poverty partnership agreement, (ii) provide consistent, updated and complementary \nqualitative poverty assessment for developing the country strategy and program for 2005\u2013\n2008,7 (iii) improve poverty assessment in the longer term, and (iv) help monitor and evaluate \nprogress in reducing poverty.  \n \nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.   Purpose and Output \n \n11.  The purpose of the TA is to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Government to \nmonitor and evaluate national poverty reduction programs and to make its poverty reduction \nmeasures more effective. The TA will help the NSO to set up and implement PPAM framework \nin collaboration with other stakeholders, particularly PRG, key sector agencies and NGOs; \nassist  policymakers  and  civil  society  to  monitor  progress  on  national  poverty  reduction \nprograms; and make actions more effective and efficient.  The TA framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n12.  The  TA  outputs  will  include  (i)  PPAM  mechanism  and  manuals  developed  and \nimplemented; (ii) enhanced capacity of Government staff from NSO, PRG, and line ministries, \nas well as civil society organizations and academia to plan and implement PPAM; and (iii) \npublication and dissemination of PPAM results. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7 ADB will use the result of LSMS 2002/2003 for quantitative poverty assessment. ", "4 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities   \n \n13.  The  TA  comprises  three  interrelated  key  activities  that  allow  for  consultation  and \nparticipation  of  stakeholders  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  implementation  of  the  poverty \nreduction strategy. The TA activities are as follows: \n \n  1.  Develop a Participatory Poverty Assessment and Monitoring (PPAM)  \n    Mechanism and Enhance Human Resources for Conducting PPAM \n \n14.  This component will (i) train government, academic and civil society institutions engaged \nin PPAM to design, collect data, and analyze poverty-related issues with the use of qualitative \nmethods; (ii) train a technical working group (TWG) to establish a consultative mechanism \namong key stakeholders for planning and disseminating the PPAM mechanism; (iii) develop \nguidebooks and manuals on PPAM; and (iv) assist TWG to identify the provinces, districts, and \nsubdistricts in rural and urban areas for the study.    \n \n2.  Implement Participatory Poverty Assessment and Monitoring \n \n15.  This component will (i) set up an effective qualitative data management system for \nmonitoring progress in poverty reduction; (ii) develop methods of PPAM; (iii) train the research \nteam; (iv) select provinces, districts, and subdistricts for the study, based on criteria that will be \nrecommended by the TWG; and (v) conduct PPAM activities by engaging nongovernment \norganizations. \n \n3.  Disseminate and Publish PPAM Results \n \n16.    This  component  will  (i)  analyze  information  needed  to  support  monitoring  of  the \nEGSPRS; (ii) organize stakeholder workshops for designing, implementing and disseminating \nthe PPAM and its results at central and local levels; (iii) conduct periodic seminars to discuss \nthe main TA findings with Government officials, academia, civil society organizations, private \nsector, and development partners; (iv) publish a PPAM report and support the publication of the \nongoing quantitative poverty assessment based on the new HIES/LSMS; and (v) organize a \nmass media campaign on issues related to poverty and living standards in Mongolia.  \n \nC.   Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $360,000 equivalent comprising $120,000 in \nforeign exchange and $240,000 equivalent in local currency.  The NPRS Fund will finance the \nTA for $300,000 equivalent on a grant basis to be administered by ADB.8 The remaining \n$60,000 equivalent will be contributed by the Government in kind and will cover office space, \nadministrative support, and counterpart staff remuneration. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.    Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  NSO will be the Executing Agency and PRG will implement component 3, dissemination \nand publication. A senior officer from NSO will be appointed as project director and will be \nresponsible for day-to-day TA implementation.  The TWG will be established and will be headed \nby the chairman of NSO. The composition of the TWG will be as follows: deputy director, \n                                                 \n8 The TA was endorsed at the 4th Strategy Meeting for the NPRS Fund on 27\u201329 December 2003 in Manila.
