INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Timor-Leste requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to support the commercial transformation of Banco Nacional de \nCom\u00e9rcio de Timor-Leste (BNCTL).1 The TA aims to support economic growth and strengthen \nthe Timorese finance sector. It will assist BNCTL in upgrading its institutional capacity and \ngovernance arrangements by (i) assessing BNCTL\u2019s operations and financial performance, and \nreview its strategic and business plan for 2014\u20132017; and (ii) supporting BNCTL\u2019s management \nand staff to apply commercial banking principles efficiently and effectively. This is consistent \nwith the government\u2019s strategic development plan, 2011\u20132030 and the Master Plan for Financial \nSector  Development,  2014\u20132025.2 It  also  reflects  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  strategy  and  the  country \npartnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 for Timor-Leste, and is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan, 2015\u20132017.3 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  The TA fact-finding mission concluded with a memorandum of understanding outlining \nagreed impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, and outline terms of reference \nfor  consultants.  The  TA  was  discussed  with  BNCTL,  development  partners,  government \nagencies, and the Banco Central de Timor-Leste (Central Bank of Timor-Leste).  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The finance sector with its institutions and processes plays a crucial role in supporting \neconomic development. Improving the provision of financial services is critical to increasing the \nliving standards of all Timorese. Without access to \ufb01nancial services, businesses cannot grow; \nentrepreneurship is stifled; and people on low incomes cannot save securely to invest, pay bills, \nor move beyond subsistence living standards. They have little chance to manage economic \nrisks. The still developing financial system in Timor-Leste constrains rural and urban populations \nin achieving these development objectives. At the end of 2013, the value of private sector credit \nwas $177 million, equivalent to only 11% of gross domestic product. Lending to the agriculture \nsector was only 3% of total outstanding credit at the end of 2013. \n \n4.  The banking industry comprises three foreign-owned banks\u2014ANZ Bank from Australia, \nBank Mandiri from Indonesia, and Banco Nacional Ultramarino (BNU) from Portugal\u2014and one \nlocally owned bank, BNCTL, which the government owns. The foreign banks dominate the \nsector; BNCTL accounted for about 7% of banking system deposits and about 11% of banking \nsystem  credit  at  the  end  of  2013.  Nonbank  credit  providers  include  two  microfinance \ninstitutions\u2014Moris Rasik and Tuba Rai Metin\u2014which offer financial services to the low-income \nand  mainly  rural  population.  Both  institutions  are  financially  weak,  despite  lending  at  high \ninterest rates (around 20% annually). There are also several small and financially weak credit \nunions with a limited customer base. \n \n5.  Despite the presence of foreign banks, provision of credit remains constrained. The \nloan\u2013deposit ratio for the banking system was only about 30% at the end of 2013. Banks have \nbeen  reluctant  to  lend  to  Timorese  businesses  because  they  consider  the  risks  too  high, \nwhether for agricultural or small and medium-sized enterprises. A lack of collateral, incomplete \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 November 2014. \n2  Government of Timor-Leste. 2011.

Manila.  \n ", "2  \nlegal frameworks, weak contract enforcement mechanisms, and poor financial information on \nborrowers due to the absence of a credit bureau have contributed to these unfavorable risk \nassessments. Banks\u2019 nonperforming loan ratios have been persistently high, and stood at 27% \nfor the banking sector as a whole at the end of 2013. Two of the three foreign banks operate \nonly in Dili, while the third, BNU, has moved only recently to increase its presence outside Dili. \nBNCTL,  by  contrast,  is  well  established  outside  Dili  and  is  represented  in  Timor-Leste\u2019s \n13 districts.  BNCTL  also  operates  a  sub-branch  in  Atauro  and  a  mobile  banking  service \nwhereby vans visit selected remote districts. While it has a lower nonperforming loan ratio than \nthe industry as a whole, it has a very narrow product offering\u2014a major share of the total loan \nportfolio consists of low-risk multipurpose loans4\u2014and has not fully shed its microfinance legacy.  \n \n6.  BNCTL was established in July 2011, when the former Institui\u00e7\u00e3o de Micro Finan\u00e7as de \nTimor-Leste,  founded  in  2002,  was  transformed  into  a  commercial  bank  and  granted  an \nunrestricted banking license. BNCTL\u2019s original mandate was to increase access to finance for \nthe poorer sections of the population and small businesses, but on commercial terms. ADB \nprovided technical assistance to the former Institui\u00e7\u00e3o de Micro Finan\u00e7as de Timor-Leste and \nBNCTL to support this objective.5 To date, still a significant portion of BNCTL\u2019s customer base \ncomprises government employees and veterans. At the end of August 2014, BNCTL had 17,100 \nloan accounts and 151,100 savings account customers and a total balance sheet of $48.1 \nmillion. The government, as the sole shareholder, and the central bank have now directed \nBNCTL to play a more active role in the banking sector and hasten its transformation into a \nmainstream commercial bank. The primary objectives are to finance local business activity, \nincluding agriculture, and extend the range and quality of financial services in Timor-Leste. The \ncentral bank also wants to increase the number of banks in Timor-Leste to boost competition, \nbut it is reluctant to do so until BNCTL is strong enough to withstand additional competition.  \n \n7.  To this end, Secret\u00e1ria de Estado para o Apoio e Promo\u00e7\u00e3o do Setor Privado Timor-\nLeste  (State  Secretary  for  Support  and  Promotion  of  the  Private  Sector  Timor-Leste),  the \nshareholder representative, has increased BNCTL\u2019s board to include people with commercial \nbanking experience in Timor-Leste. The new board has overseen the development of the 2014\u2013\n2017  strategic  and  business  plan,  which  requires  support  for  implementation.  The  Pacific \nPrivate Sector Development Initiative (PSDI) has been working with the BNCTL board and \nmanagement to support the implementation of this plan by appointing an internal audit advisor, \nhoping that this support also provides the foundation for longer-term ADB assistance.6 The \nPSDI is also working with the government to implement the secured transactions reform. The \nreform  will  complement  the  transformation  of  BNCTL  by  unlocking  the  collateral  value  of \nmovable  assets  to  reduce  risk  and  increase  lending.  More  recently,  the  PSDI  has  begun \ndiscussions with the central bank, at the request of the governor, on a package of financial \nsector development activities. \n \n8.  The commercial transformation of BNCTL in line with the requirements of its commercial \nbanking license will expand its product portfolio, strengthen its balance sheet, and increase its \nattractiveness  to  strategic  investors.  To  fully  achieve  the  desired  transformation,  BNCTL \nrequires substantial assistance. It will need to expand its customer base and product range, \nincluding  savings  and  fee-based  products,  review  its  pricing  structures,  and  implement \n                                                 \n4  These are provided to formal employees, guaranteed by the payroll. \n5  ADB. 2000.

For this, an adequate core banking system needs to be in place. In \naddition,  BNCTL  will  need  to  develop  staff capability  to  implement  the  business  plan  and \nimprove service levels to match the foreign banks\u2019 offerings. BNU, in particular, is aggressively \nexpanding ATMs and point-of-sale electronic fund transfers. The use of these technologies is \nincreasing quickly, so much so that by June 2014, transaction volumes were higher for BNU \nATMs than for BNU branches. Accordingly, BNCTL has identified priority areas for assistance: \ncredit  and  treasury  operations,  banking  information  technology  infrastructure,  product \ndevelopment, and staff capacity building. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The expected impact will be that a large portion of the population has access to and \nuses a range of financial services. The intended outcome will be an improved BNCTL, growing \nand operating sustainably, consistent with its commercial banking license.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  ADB\u2019s assistance will support BNCTL to upgrade its institutional capacity, covering bank \noperations, human resources, banking technology, and governance arrangements. To ensure \nownership and compatibility with existing capacities, the TA will be implemented in two phases \nand have the following outputs: (i) phase one\u2014road map and action plan for comprehensive \ninstitutional strengthening finalized; and (ii) phase two\u2014BNCTL management and staff apply \ncommercial  banking  principles  efficiently  and  effectively.  Phase  one  will  comprise  an \nassessment  of  BNCTL\u2019s  operations  and  financial  performance,  including  governance \narrangements, and a review of the 2014\u20132017 strategic and business plan.7 A road map and \naction plan for institutional strengthening will be developed and agreed with BNCTL. The road \nmap will prioritize the areas where support is needed, the required input, and the milestones to \nbe  achieved.  A  study  tour  will  be  organized  to  visit  a  potential  role  model,  i.e.,  a  fully \ncommercialized but still government-owned institution. Phase one will be highly participatory, \nwith the BNCTL board, senior management, and staff actively engaged throughout to ensure \ntheir commitment to the commercial transformation of BNCTL. \n \n11.  Based on the findings of phase one and resultant recommendations (documented in the \nroad map and action plan for institutional strengthening), phase two will comprise technical \nsupport to underpin the implementation of BNCTL\u2019s business plan. This will include long-term \ninstitutional capacity building in areas identified as essential to implementing the business plan \nand  the  associated  commercial  transformation.  While  these  areas  can  be  determined \nconclusively only in the phase-one assessment, they are likely to be operational support for \ncredit  and  treasury  operations,  risk  management,  product  development,  and  information \ntechnology  enhancement  and  support.  Substantive  hands-on  training  for  key  staff  will  be \nprovided to ensure that management and staff apply commercial banking principles effectively \nand efficiently. This will be complemented with training courses for staff by an Asian bank \ntraining  institute.8 Support  will  be  provided  responsively  and  according  to  the  institution\u2019s \nabsorptive capacity. This also means that support will need to be able to adjust to changes in \n                                                 \n7  The assessment will be coordinated closely with ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department. \n8  BNCTL is in discussions with an Indonesian bank training institute for standard and tailor-made courses for staff. \n ", "4  \nthe strategic and business plan, which may evolve with changes in BNCTL and the wider \nfinance sector.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $825,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). BNCTL will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of office space for consultants (including furniture and other office equipment, \nas necessary) office supplies, staff time, workshop facilities, domestic transport, and other in-\nkind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  BNCTL will be the executing and the implementing agency for this TA.  \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented over 42 months from 30 December 2014 to 30 June 2018, \nwith phase one estimated to take 7 months and phase two 35 months. It is anticipated that a \ntotal of 22 person-months of intermittent international consulting services will be required to \nimplement the TA. For phase one, an estimated 6 person-months (international, intermittent) of \nconsulting services will be needed. This will be a banking operations advisor (3 person-months) \nand a banking information technology expert (3 person-months). The consulting input for phase \ntwo  is  unallocated  and  will  be  determined  after  phase  one,  once  the  findings  and \nrecommendations for implementation have been discussed and agreed with the BNCTL board. \nThis approach is important to ensure that the design is not based on preconceived ideas but \nsubject to actual assessment and findings. It is envisaged that phase-two services will comprise \ncontinued  inputs  from  the  banking  operations  advisor  and  banking  information  technology \nexpert,9 plus potentially\u2014depending on the findings of phase one\u2014a credit risk management \nexpert, a treasury expert, and/or a banking product and marketing expert. Their required input \nwill be specified after completion of phase one. \n15.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  individually  under  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time).10 Contracts will be intermittent and longer-\nterm. This will be important to ensure flexibility during TA implementation and be responsive to \nBNCTL\u2019s absorption capacity. Consultants may be recruited as resource persons for a specific \nshort-term input, e.g., to help organize a strategic workshop with BNCTL\u2019s board. The outline \nterms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  Consultants  will  arrange  seminars. \nSpecific training courses and study visits for BNCTL staff and senior management, including \nboard members, will be paid through the TA.11 ADB staff can be used as sector, thematic, or \ntechnical experts and resource persons. Their travel-related expenses will be paid through the \nTA.12 The  TA  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n16.  TA progress will be monitored against the activities, outputs, and outcome as described \nin the design and monitoring framework. ADB will assist BNCTL and the government in sharing \n                                                 \n9  Contracts will be phased and conditional, i.e., continuation of services will be subject to meeting certain conditions.  \n10 To reduce administrative burden and improve economy and efficiency, and value for money, consulting services \nunder the TA will be engaged on output-based (lump-sum) contracts, if feasible. \n11  Direct payment via bank transfer to the end users (the training institute or BNCTL, should expenses incurred be \nreimbursed) will be considered after the TA officer has approved the cost estimate or invoice. \n12 ADB. 2013.
