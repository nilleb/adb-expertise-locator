THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Low Carbon Agricultural Support Project.1,2  \n \n2.  The  project  will  reduce  pollution  from  agricultural  waste  by  using  climate-smart \nagricultural waste management practices (CSAWMP).3  It will process agricultural and rural \nhousehold wastes into clean energy and bio-slurry,4 and disseminate, strengthen, and diversify \nthe knowledge base for the application of CSAWMP. This will create a healthier environment \nand improve livelihoods in the 10 target provinces of Bac Giang, Ben Tre, Binh Dinh, Ha Tinh, \nLao Cai, Nam Dinh, Phu Tho, Soc Trang, Son La, and Tien Giang.5   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Viet Nam\u2019s agriculture sector constitutes about 20% of gross domestic product (GDP) \nand 25% of exports (2010), and provides employment for 70% of rural households.6 Livestock\u2019s \nshare of the agriculture sector increased from 19.3% in 2000 to 27.1% in 2009. The number of \nfarmers and medium- to large-scale enterprises raising livestock is steadily increasing. This \ngrowth is contributing to economic prosperity as well as poverty reduction in rural communities. \nHowever, livestock production puts a serious stress on the environment. Discharging untreated \nlivestock waste carries high level of pathogens, which pollutes water resources, endangers \nhuman and animal health, and emits greenhouse gases (GHGs).7 Furthermore, in Viet Nam, \nagriculture is the highest contributor of GHGs (50%), followed by energy (25%), forestry (19%), \nand industry (4%). Among agricultural activities, rice cultivation is the highest source of GHG \nemissions (45%), followed by livestock raising (35%).  \n \n4.  The Government of Viet Nam intends to progressively adopt CSAWMP by promoting the \nuse of biogas plants to treat agricultural and rural household waste. Properly constructed biogas \nplants yield important benefits by (i) reducing human and livestock disease outbreaks; air, \nwater, and soil pollutants; and firewood consumption; (ii) increasing savings of time and money, \nquantity and quality of organic fertilizer use, and access to rural income-enhancing carbon credit \nschemes; and (iii) producing biogas that can be used as renewable clean energy (gas and \nelectricity) as well as bio-slurry, a clean organic fertilizer. Transformation of agricultural and rural \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The project preparation was funded by technical assistance attached to ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation \nof the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Quality and \nSafety Enhancement of Agricultural Products and Biogas Development Project. Manila (Loan 2513-VIE). \n3 CSAWMP are an integral part of climate-smart agriculture practices, defined as \u201cagriculture that sustainably \nincreases  productivity,  resilience,  reduces  or  removes  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emission  and  enhances \nachievement of national food security and development goals.\u201d (Food and Agriculture Organization. 2011. Climate \nSmart Agriculture, Managing Ecosystems for Sustainable Livelihoods.  Rome). \n4  Bio-slurry is the decomposed output of organic materials produced in the reduction process in the presence of \nanaerobic microbes in a biogas digester. (Office of Scientific and Technical Information. United States Department \nof Energy. 2011. Guidebook on Biogas Development. New York).   \n5  The provinces were selected based on (i) prevailing density of livestock (and hence potential demand for biogas \nplants); (ii) existence of and support for safe livestock zones; (iii) willingness of provincial governments to provide \ncounterpart funds; and (iv) complementarities with similar initiatives by other partners. \n6  Sector Assessment; Country Economic Indicators (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  GHGs arising from agri-waste mainly comprise methane (CH , 60%\u201375%) and carbon dioxide (CO 33%\u201319%). \n4 2, \nCH is 21 times more potent than CO , but compared with other hydrocarbon fuels, burning methane produces less \n4  2\nCO for each unit of heat released. (International Fund for Agricultural Development. 2008. Livestock and Climate \n2 \nChange. Rome). ", "2              \n \nhousehold waste into clean energy and fertilizers through the use of biogas plants is referred \nherein as the biogas value chain (BVC). \n \n5.  Viet Nam has about 8.5 million farmers and 21,000 enterprises raising livestock. The \nnumber of farms with SBPs increased from about 2,000 in 1990 to 500,000 in 2010.8 However, \nthis is well below the government\u2019s target of 2 million SBPs and 21,000 MBPs and LBPs by \n2020.  For  the  21,000  livestock  enterprises,  less  than  1,000  MBPs  and  LBPs  have  been \nconstructed. In the 10 project provinces, it is estimated that 162,350 SBPs, and 167 MBPs and \nLBPs have been constructed. This accounts for only 11% of the MBP and 3% of the LBP market \npotential. Also, no MBPs or LBPs have been constructed in Ben Tre and Tien Giang provinces; \nand in Binh Dinh province, 77% of livestock farms are without biogas plants. The progress in \nmeeting  the  government  targets  for  biogas  plants  is  constrained  by  (i)  lack  of  affordable \nmedium- and long-term financing for building livestock waste management infrastructure; (ii) \ninadequate CSAWMP knowledge transfer and development; and (iii) poor CSAWMP uptake.  \n \n6.  The project objectives are fully aligned with the government\u2019s Third Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan, 2011\u20132015, which promotes resource sustainability. The Five-Year Plan for \nAgriculture Development, 2011\u20132015 of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development \n(MARD) prioritizes programs to better control livestock disease and improve natural resource \nmanagement. The project supports MARD\u2019s Action Plan on Climate Change by strengthening \nadaptation and mitigation measures. The relevant policy frameworks followed by the project \ninclude  National  Environment  Strategy  (2001\u20132020)  and  National  Target  Program  on \nEconomical Use of Energy (2006\u20132015). The project is consistent with the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132015, and is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan, 2012\u20132014, which envisage continuing support to conserving and sustainably \nusing natural resources as well as climate change mitigation.9 ADB\u2019s \u2018Energy for All\u2019 initiative \nhas been providing technical inputs to project and implementation design for increased access \nto energy in rural areas.  \n \n7.  Lessons. The project design incorporates lessons from the experiences of ADB and \nother development partners in Viet Nam and other countries.10 Based on these experiences, the \nproject introduces updated biogas technologies and business models suitable to Vietnamese \nconditions. Assessments of credit lines and capacity of financial intermediaries to deliver credit \nfor financing biogas plant construction showed that it will be desirable and feasible to use \nfinancial intermediary networks to deliver predictable and affordable financing to eligible project \nbeneficiaries.11 The project completion report of the Efficient Utilization of Agricultural Wastes \nProject in the People\u2019s Republic of China demonstrated that biogas plant investments are viable \nover the 6 years of project duration, as lower energy costs and greater use of organic fertilizers \nboosted household incomes by about 86% (or about 15% annually).12 In Viet Nam, households \nusing SBPs can save about $168 million annually on fuel. Savings accruing from the use of bio-\nslurry instead of chemical fertilizers are also substantial, but vary with farming systems and \nmanagement practices. The Viet Nam Biogas Survey 2011, conducted by the Biogas Program \nDevelopment funded by the Government of the Netherlands, noted that the biogas plants also \n                                                 \n8  However, of the waste produced from livestock, only 3% is used as organic fertilizer and 15% is used to produce \nbiogas. Biogas plants are commonly categorized by the size of their digesters: (i) small biogas plants (SBPs) are \nup to 50 cubic meters (m3) in size; (ii) medium-sized biogas plants (MBPs) are 51\u20131,000 m3; and (iii) large biogas \nplants (LBPs) are greater than 1,000 m3. \n9  ADB. 2012.

Completion Report: Efficient Utilization of Agricultural Wastes Project in China. Manila.  ", "  3 \nyielded social, environmental, and health benefits for rural communities.  \n \n8.  Key lessons are: (i) SBP construction technology is well established, but improved BVC \nmanagement  is  needed  to  fully  realize  potential  economic  and  environmental  benefits;  (ii) \ntechnical guidelines and procedures should be simplified to enable timely subloan approval and \ndisbursement; (iii) access to credit improves livelihoods of project beneficiaries by significantly \nincreasing income; and (iv) market interest rate does not deter farmers from investing in biogas \nplants\u2014timely access to credit and technical know-how are the main constraints. \n \n9.  The Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (VBARD) and the Central \nPeople\u2019s Credit Fund (CCF) are found to have an acceptable loan portfolio quality, with less \nthan  5%  overdue  outstanding  loans  and  a  demonstrated  ability  to  reach  beneficiaries.  As \npresented in the completion report of the Tea and Fruit Development Project, $26.5 million of \ncredit (about 88% of the ADB loan portfolio) was delivered through VBARD and CCF.13 These \nfinancial intermediaries successfully served 67,314 sub-borrowers, with a 98% repayment rate. \nIn  the  ongoing  Quality  and  Safety  Enhancement  of  Agricultural  Products  and  Biogas \nDevelopment Project, the same financial intermediaries are delivering $12.1 million of credit.14 \nAbout 43% of the credit was disbursed within a 16-month period.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact will be less agriculture-related pollution, as measured by better water quality \ndue to reduced presence of livestock waste effluence. The outcome will be greater CSAWMP \nuptake, as measured by increased use of clean biogas energy and organic bio-slurry fertilizers. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n1.  Expanded Use of Livestock Waste Management Infrastructure \n \n11.  The project will (i) support construction of about 36,000 SBPs, 40 MBPs, and 10 LBPs; \n(ii) empower biogas plant operators, masons, technicians, engineers, contractors, and biogas \nassociations to follow good BVC management practices; (iii) promote the transition of BVC \nmanagement from being led by government to being led by the private sector; and (iv) support \nthe government\u2019s efforts to access existing and future markets for carbon credits.15  \n \n12.  To support national policies, strategies, and programs aimed at compliance with biogas \nplant  technical  and  environmental  standards,  the  project  will  provide  incentives  for  carbon \nmarket development (ICMDs) to BVC owners.16 The provision of ICMDs will accelerate the rate \nof BVC investments and is consistent with good practice by development partners involved in \nsimilar projects. ICMDs will also stimulate public\u2013private partnership, so that public investment \nin pollution control measures can leverage greater private investments.  \n \n13.  The government intends to recover the ICMD outlays from the income earned through \ncarbon markets. The project is expected to reduce carbon dioxide (CO ) equivalent emissions of \n2\n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2009.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Quality and Safety Enhancement of Agricultural Products and Biogas \nDevelopment Project. Manila (Loan 2513-VIE). \n15  A carbon credit is a generic term for any tradable certificate or permit representing the right to emit one metric ton \nof CO , or the mass of another GHG equivalent to one metric ton of CO . \n2 2\n16  ICMDs are divided into technical compliance for biogas plant construction and compliance with environmental \nsafeguards, budgeted at D1.2 million and D1.8 million, respectively, for each SBP; and certain incentives for MBPs \nand LBPs as described in detail in the PAM (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4              \n \n150,000 tons annually. The project will support MARD\u2019s existing coordination and management \nentity to become a viable carbon market coordinator. The entity will work with farmer, biogas, \nand other associations to (i) expand the use of a database, which contains information about \nBVC owners and those trained to deliver services for construction and operation of biogas \nplants;17 (ii)  register  biogas  plant  activities  in  potential  carbon  markets;  (iii)  monitor  BVC-\ngenerated salable and sustainable carbon credits; and (iv) disseminate guidelines on accessing \ncarbon credits and revenue sharing to BVC owners and other stakeholders. The ongoing ADB \nproject (footnote 14), in coordination with the biogas program funded by the Government of the \nNetherlands, has explored revenue from several carbon markets. The proposed project will also \nexplore access to voluntary and other carbon markets.18  \n \n2.  Credit Lines for Biogas Value Chains \n \n14.  Identified financial intermediaries are not short of liquidity, but their mobilized funds are \nmostly short term, and they are only permitted to utilize 30% of these funds to finance medium- \nand long-term loans. The project will provide credit lines through financial intermediaries to \nsmall-scale farmers as well as medium-sized and large livestock enterprises to facilitate access \nto medium- and long-term financing (up to 10 years) to expand and improve BVC infrastructure. \nThe credit lines will enable more rural people to participate in the formal financial system, thus \nproviding opportunities to access credit for additional productive purposes. Linking BVC owners \nand financial intermediaries is expected to accelerate progress toward achieving Viet Nam\u2019s \nnational biogas targets. The proposed credit lines will help familiarize financial intermediaries \nwith this previously untapped market segment, and promote geographic outreach of financial \nintermediaries to rural household enterprises. The project will provide appropriate management \nand technical capacity building to financial intermediary loan officers to serve this market. Credit \nlines for BVC infrastructure will initially flow through VBARD and CCF, which are state-owned. \nParticipation of other financiers, including private financial intermediaries, will be explored and \nencouraged during project implementation. Financial intermediaries will prepare transparent and \nfinancially  sound  criteria  for  the  selection  of sub-borrowers  to  enhance  loan  targeting  and \nrepayment.  \n \n3.  Enhanced Climate-Smart Agricultural Waste Management Practices \nTechnology Transfer  \n \n15.  The project will disseminate established CSAWMP to beneficiaries and research those \nareas where good practice is not well established. Viet Nam has established CSAWMP in \nseveral areas. They are supported by guidelines that are ready for immediate dissemination to \nenterprises, communes, villages, and farmers. The project will improve the skills and knowledge \nof stakeholders for managing agricultural wastes through dissemination campaigns, commune \npilot  demonstrations,  short  training  courses,  study  tours,  e-libraries,  radio  and  television \nprograms, DVDs, and information posters. Additionally, agro-ecological maps will be updated. \n \n16.  Some areas of CSAWMP in Viet Nam still require research for specific environmental \nand  geographic  conditions.  The  project  will  support  research  activities  in  two  stages  by \nelaborating a research strategy to provide coherent direction to project research activities, and \nextending research into practice. The project will prepare a CSAWMP research strategy, which \nwill (i) define the government\u2019s long-term objectives to manage agricultural wastes; (ii) assess \n                                                 \n17 The database was created by the Department of Livestock and is currently used for the biogas development \nprogram funded by the Government of the Netherlands. \n18  Carbon Market Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) provides detailed \nplans for carbon market development in Viet Nam. ", "  5 \ncurrent knowledge and practice, along with relevant institutional issues; (iii) define and prioritize \nresearch, dissemination, and mainstreaming gaps that need to be bridged; and (iv) outline the \nactivities needed to fill the gaps. Accordingly, the project will carry out research, disseminate the \nfindings to practitioners, and mainstream them into standard practice. Research activities may \ninclude use of non-livestock agricultural wastes for producing bioenergy and organic fertilizers, \nand application of low GHG emission practices in agriculture (including aquaculture).   \n \n4.  Effective Project Management \n \n17.  The government will provide skilled central and provincial personnel. The project will \nengage  specialist  consultants  and  contractors  to  supplement  technical  and  management \nknowledge and skills. Coordination with relevant organizations will be a management priority. \nMARD  will  use  a  project  performance  management  system  with  sex-  and  ethnicity-\ndisaggregated data to accurately monitor project progress. \n \nD.

The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will enter into subsidiary loan agreements with financial \nintermediaries that will extend subloans ($35.7 million, about 48% of the ADB loan) to eligible \nbeneficiaries. The relending from MOF to the financial intermediaries will be denominated in \ndong with the foreign exchange risk to be borne by the government. Terms and conditions of the \nrelending from MOF to partner financial intermediaries will be decided by the government and \nagreed by ADB.  \n \n22.  Relending from MOF to financial intermediaries with terms up to 20 years with 6 years \ngrace period will help the financial intermediaries sustain medium- and long-term loan portfolios \nand facilitate fund mismatch risk management. The financial intermediaries agreed that MOF\u2019s \ninterest  rate  for  the  onlending  to  financial  intermediaries  will  be  ADB\u2019s  lending  rate  plus \nexchange  rate  risk  premium  (currently  about  6%)  plus  0.2%  service  cost.  The  financial \nintermediary subloans will be made in local currency and in strict accordance with selection \ncriteria  agreed  between  the  government  and  ADB  (\u201celigibility  criteria,\u201d  including  minimum \nnumber of livestock, technical engineering, construction and environmental compliance for the \nconstruction of biogas plants, and collateral according to prudential requirements by the State \nBank of Viet Nam) and will otherwise carry such terms and conditions as are currently applied \nby the financial intermediaries, with any amendments to be agreed with ADB from time to time. \nThe  interest  rate  for  subloans  to  beneficiaries  will  be  determined  based  on  market  rates \n(currently up to 15%). Technical, environmental, and other criteria related to biogas plants and \nthe criteria for the selection of beneficiaries, each as agreed with ADB, will be added to partner \nfinancial intermediaries\u2019 standard eligibility criteria to ensure the project\u2019s targeted clientele is \nreached. For the credit line provided for the construction of biogas plants, ADB will finance 85% \nand the financial intermediaries will finance 15%. The disbursement of the credit line will be \nsubject to the financial intermediaries\u2019 entry into (i) a project agreement with ADB; and (ii) a \nsubsidiary loan agreement with the government on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  MARD  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  will  delegate  overall  responsibility  to  its \nAgriculture Projects Management Board, which will establish a central project management unit \n(CPMU) responsible for central project coordination and assisted by a technical support unit. \nThe implementing agencies will be the provincial people\u2019s committees of the 10 participating \nprovinces, and the two financial intermediaries, VBARD and CCF, which have been assessed \nas  complying  with  the  criteria  set  out  in  the  Operations  Manual  section  on  financial \nintermediation loans (footnote 11).20 The effectiveness of project agreements for the financial \n                                                 \n20  ADB. 2003. Financial Intermediation Loans. Operations Manual. D6/BP. Manila. ", "  7 \nintermediaries will be processed independently from the loan effectiveness. Each committee will \nact  through  its  Department  of  Agricultural  and  Rural  Development,  which  will  establish  a \nprovincial project management unit (PPMU) responsible for province-specific, day-to-day project \nmanagement. MARD and the implementing agencies have demonstrated adequate financial \nand  management  capacity,  and  experience  to  implement  the  project,  having  implemented \nseveral  significant  externally  funded  projects,  including  ADB  projects.  During  project \nimplementation, the CPMU will establish synergies with the ongoing ADB project for knowledge \ntransfer and capacity sharing (footnote 14).  \n \n24.  The PPMUs will work closely with relevant stakeholders to disseminate technical and \nfinancial  CSAWMP  information  to  communes  and  private  sector  investors.  A  budgetary \nallocation is made for the facilitation and coordination costs in each participating province. Three \nimprest  accounts  will  be  established:  one  each  for  the  CPMU  and  the  two  financial \nintermediaries. Eleven sub-accounts will be established, one each for the 10 PPMUs and the \ntechnical support unit. The government will provide project staff capable of using standard \ngovernment  accounting  and  financial  management  systems.  The  government,  through  the \nCPMU, will allocate financial incentives to eligible households and enterprises as an ICMD. The \nICMD will be credited to BVC owners\u2019 accounts at financial intermediaries once technicians \ncertify that the BVC infrastructure meets relevant construction and environmental standards.  \n \n25.  Consultants and other service providers will be recruited by the CPMU and/or PPMUs in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime) to assist in project implementation. They will provide capacity building, research, studies, \ntraining, and other services to achieve the project\u2019s intended targets and ensure that safeguard \nissues are properly dealt with. The CPMU and PPMUs will procure goods, civil works, and other \ncontracts in accordance with ADB Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). The project will be implemented from 2013 to 2018. Implementation arrangements are \nsummarized in Table 3, and described in detail in the project administration manual.21  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements\nImplementation period  January 2013\u2013December 2018 (6 years) \nEstimated completion date  31 December  2018 \nManagement \n(i)   Executing agency  Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development \n(ii)   Implementing agencies   10 provincial people\u2019s committees and two financial intermediaries  \n(iii)  Implementation units  CPMU in Ha Noi (25 government and contractual staff maximum); PPMUs to be \nlocated in each provincial capital with an average 10 staff each. \nProcurement   National competitive bidding  5 contracts  $1.4 million \nShopping   20 contracts  $1.0 million \nThrough financial intermediaries  36,050 contracts  $42.0 million \nGovernment procedures  None   No procurement  \nConsulting and other services  882 person-months  $4.0 million \nAdvance action  Consultant  selection  procedures  for  loan  implementation  consultants  will  be \nundertaken on noncommittal basis prior to loan effectiveness. \nDisbursement   The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n21  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8              \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n26.  The project's viability has been assessed from various aspects, outlined in this section. It \nis expected to serve about 36,050 households as its direct beneficiaries. Since it will reduce \nagricultural wastes, it will provide positive impacts on the life and livelihood of rural people. \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n27.  SBP construction technology is well-established in Viet Nam. For MBPs and LBPs, \nhowever, technical options vary according to farm-specific parameters. The project will improve \nthe capacity of beneficiaries to select the best technical option. Design and implementation \nquality  will  ensure  that  investments  are  technically  and  environmentally  sound,  meet  CER \nmechanisms, and are financially viable. Technical options are described in the guidelines for \nBVCs and in the detailed economic and financial analysis.22 Research, training, extension, \ninfrastructure, technology and other development support will improve the CSAWMP knowledge \nbase,  productivity,  and  profitability.  The  project  will  recruit  consultants  to  prepare  detailed \nguidelines for BVCs, research, extension, and monitoring systems.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n \n28.  The SBP financial internal rate of return is about 25.3%, higher than the weighted \naverage cost of capital (about 4.0%). The financial internal rates of return for different types and \nsizes and retention periods of the 52 models of MBPs and LBPs vary from \u201311.1% to 21.1%. \nThe project will select only viable biogas plant models.23 The overall economic internal rate of \nreturn is estimated at 23.8%. Sensitivity analysis, including switching values, for the financial \nand economic analysis of most biogas plant types and sizes by retention show that the project is \neconomically viable and sufficiently robust. A demand survey conducted in five of 10 project \nprovinces found that about 80% of target beneficiaries are ready and/or planning to construct \nbiogas plants.24 About 72% of farmers are willing to borrow to finance biogas plant construction. \nUsing the current annual interest rate (currently up to 15%), the repayment capacity of sub-\nborrowers will be up to 5 years for SBPs and 10 years for MBPs and LBPs. Affordability analysis \nbased on similar lending arrangements indicates that farmers can afford loans up to $2,500 \nequivalent for SBPs; $85,000 equivalent for MBPs; and $187,000 equivalent for LBPs.25 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n29.  Procurement funded by the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). MARD will ensure that all \naccounts  administered  by  the  CPMU,  PPMUs,  the  technical  support  unit,  and  financial \nintermediaries are audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB. The project will strengthen \ncapacities of CPMU and PPMU staff in financial management procedures to allow efficient \noperation  of  imprest  and  sub-accounts,  and  reporting  of  financial  performance  to  the \ngovernment and ADB. District and lower-level administrations and communities will participate \nin monitoring project implementation where possible. The project will establish a website to \n                                                 \n22  Project Administration Manual; Detailed Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n23  The viability of each model is given in Detailed  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n24  Respondents who have not yet constructed biogas plants.

Based on ADB\u2019s Public Communications \nPolicy (2011), the government has agreed that ADB shall post on its website the annual audited \nproject accounts. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and MARD. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 21). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n30.  Benefits. Poverty levels among direct beneficiaries in 10 provinces range from 15% to \n25%.  Project  investments  will  generate  indirect  benefits  by  increasing  overall  access  to \nrenewable energy, a healthier environment, and rural employment. Time and cost savings from \nenergy substitution and fewer livestock disease outbreaks will boost beneficiaries\u2019 incomes. \nApplication of bio-slurry fertilizer will improve crop productivity while reducing input costs.26  \n \n31.  Gender impact. The project promotes effective gender mainstreaming and will have the \nfollowing key gender impacts: (i) reduced women\u2019s workload related to collecting fuel wood as \nwell as time savings that can be better spent in leisure and productive activities; (ii) better health \nstatus of women and their families as a result of better sanitation; (iii) women\u2019s empowerment \nthrough access to credit for SBP construction, skills training for, and employment opportunities \nin, biogas plant construction, operation and maintenance; and (iv) more income from greater \nagricultural productivity with CSAWMP technology use. The project\u2019s gender action plan will \nensure that women constitute (i) at least 50% of credit recipients for biogas plant construction, \n(ii) at least 20% of those trained on biogas management and technical issues and certified as \nmasons, (iii) at least 50% of those trained on biogas technology utilization, (iv) at least 40% of \nthose selected as champions in research and dissemination of CSAWMP technology, and (v) \n30% of CPMU and PPMU staff.27 In addition, 30% of research projects will cover gender-related \nissues, and the CPMU and each PPMU will have a gender focal point. A sex-disaggregated \ndatabase will be set up as part of the project performance management system, and gender \nindicators are included in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n32.  Environment (category B). The project will have positive impacts on the environment \nby improving livestock waste management practices, thereby reducing agricultural pollutants \nand GHG emissions. An initial environmental examination and environmental assessment and \nreview framework will guide project implementation at all stages.28 The initial environmental \nexamination has assessed potential adverse environmental impacts for MBPs and LBPs and \nproposed necessary mitigation measures. The CPMU, PPMUs, and the Ministry of Natural \nResources  and  Environment  and  its  provincial  departments  will  manage  and  monitor  all \nenvironmental impacts or risks under the project. \n \n33.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). No action is needed since the project requires \nno  land  acquisition  and  has  no  involuntary  resettlement  impacts.  BVC  management \ninfrastructure will be constructed on land belonging to the BVC owners. The project selection \ncriteria will exclude activities that entail land acquisition and/or involuntary resettlement. MARD \nand the implementing agencies will monitor to ensure that land to be used for the construction \nand operation of BVCs are within that owned by the BVC beneficiaries. \n                                                 \n26  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28  Initial Environmental Examination, Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n \n34.  Indigenous peoples (category B). Among the potential beneficiaries, several ethnic \ngroups29 are considered indigenous peoples under the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \nThese indigenous peoples will potentially benefit from the project through access to credit, \ntechnical support for SBP construction, and access to knowledge and skills on CSAWMP. An \nindigenous peoples plan (ethnic minority development plan in local term) has been prepared to \nhelp them access project activities and resources, and ensure they participate in the project. \nThe plan has been endorsed by the government and approved by ADB.30  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n35.  The integrated benefits and impacts of the project are expected to outweigh the costs. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4.
