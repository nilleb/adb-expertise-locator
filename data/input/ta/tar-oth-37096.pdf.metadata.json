INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided small-scale technical assistance (TA)1 in \nApril 2002 to facilitate consultations on regional issues in the agriculture sector in the Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS) and identify opportunities for  increased cooperation among the \ncountries in the GMS (Cambodia, Yunnan Province of People's Republic of China [PRC], Lao \nPeople's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam) in addressing such issues. \nThe five countries and one province of the PRC actively participated in the activities of the \nsmall-scale TA. Under the TA, ADB also supported the subsequent dialogue and consultations \namong the GMS governments, the private sector, and the regional and international agricultural \nresearch organizations. Using these consultations, the GMS countries established a working \ngroup on agriculture (WGA) and agreed to implement the WGA's work program, which was \nendorsed at the first meeting of WGA in January 2003. At this meeting, the GMS governments \nalso  requested  ADB  to  continue  its  support  for  implementing  the  work  program.  Broad \nunderstanding was reached with the GMS governments on the purpose, expected outputs, and \nimplementation arrangements for the proposed TA.2 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Despite the relatively strong economic performance and improved living conditions in the \nGMS countries over the last decade, 10\u201340% of the people still live below the poverty line. \nThere are pockets of severe poverty and malnutrition, particularly in the rural areas. In view of \nthe importance of the agriculture sector in the GMS, sustainable agricultural growth is crucial to \nreducing rural poverty and achieving the millennium development goals. Among the GMS \ncountries, low and highly variable productivity in the agriculture sector is a particular concern, as \nit contributes directly to continued poverty and poor nutrition, and thus to increased mortality \nespecially among infants. Low productivity also increases food prices in urban areas and \ndepresses the demand for nonagriculture goods and services. In a report to the World Summit \non Sustainable Development, the Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research \n(CGIAR)  estimated  that  every  dollar  earned  by  farmers  in  low-income countries multiplies \nincome in the whole economy by up to $2.60. Moreover, a strong agriculture economy will \nincrease incentives to better protect and utilize agricultural resources in a sustainable manner. \nThus, there are compelling reasons for actions to increase pro-poor agriculture development in \nthe GMS. \n \n3.  However, several agriculture issues exist in the GMS. It is widely recognized that weak \ninstitutions, poorly developed land and factor markets, and regulatory barriers still constrain the \nsound  development  of  agricultural  input  and  output  markets.  Rural  poverty  exacerbates \nenvironmental pressures and leads to degraded forest resources. Limited access to productive \nresources often hampers the growth of potential agro-based industries. The GMS countries are \nseriously  concerned  that  their  abundant  natural  resources  cannot  be  used  effectively  for \nagricultural development and overall economic growth. It is widely recognized that weaknesses \nin information sharing and cooperation to address policy, institutional, regulatory, and technical \nbarriers to agriculture development increasingly constrain progress in sustainable agricultural \ngrowth in the region. The direct costs of such weaknesses include the following: \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.  Technical Assistance for a Study on Subregional Issues in the Agriculture Sector in the Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS). Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet) on 8 February 2003. ", "2 \n(i)  duplication of national efforts and external assistance in developing agricultural \ninstitutions and providing essential training, and in agricultural research and \nextension services; \n(ii)  missed opportunities and suboptimal adoption of improved technology in the \npoorer GMS countries; \n(iii)  suboptimal management and use of transborder resources in agriculture; \n(iv)  weak operational framework to maintain adequate standards for food safety, the \nuse of agrochemicals, biotechnology and genetically modified organisms, and \nagriculture education and research; and \n(v)  missed opportunities in ensuring that the GMS concerns are recognized in the \nregional and international framework for the agriculture sector. \n \n4.  The WGA aims to address those issues and enhance regional cooperation in agriculture \namong the GMS countries. The terms of reference for the WGA are in Appendix 2. In this \ncontext, the WGA's initial work program includes proposals to promote GMS cooperation in (i) \nimproving animal health in the livestock trade; (ii) effective use of agricultural biotechnology; (iii) \nupgrading  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  standards;  (iv)  improving  agricultural  extension  and \ntraining for women farmers; (v) increasing use of information technology in empowering poor \nfarmers;  (vi)  increasing  returns  through  improved  postharvest  management  of  rice;  (vii) \nsustainable soil nutrition management; (viii) study of demand for and supply of key agricultural \nproducts; and (ix) market research and business development. The proposed TA will support \nthese initiatives based on the priority agreed upon by the GMS countries. \n \n5.  ADB will act as a catalyst in facilitating GMS cooperation in implementing the WGA's \nwork program and transferring relevant knowledge and experience to the GMS countries. \nHowever, the responsibility for implementing the subregional activities of the WGA needs to be \ngradually transferred from ADB to sector institutions of the GMS countries. At present, ADB's \nfinancial and secretarial support is required for the WGA, and is requested by the GMS \ncountries. The proposed TA will  provide initial support and strengthen the momentum for \nsubregional cooperation in agriculture so that subregional activities can become self-reliant and \nsustained with increased ownership by the GMS countries. The assistance will also help build \npartnerships, and identify and mobilize additional resources from the private sector and other \nexternal funding agencies to expand the WGA's activities. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n6.  The TA aims to help promote partnerships in accelerating agriculture development and \npoverty reduction in the GMS. It will contribute to increased regional cooperation to reduce \nbarriers to sustainable agricultural growth and expand business opportunities in the agriculture \nsector. \n \n7.  The TA will cover the crop, livestock, fishery, and forestry subsectors. It will ensure that \nthe benefits being generated under other GMS initiatives in the transport and energy sectors will \nenhance opportunities for the rural poor. The TA will (i) establish mechanisms for regular \ndialogue  among  agriculture  experts  in  the  GMS  on  research  priorities  and  innovative \nopportunities for agricultural growth; (ii) establish agricultural information systems on GMS \nagriculture; (iii) provide opportunities to work on technical issues in the GMS cross-border \nmovement of agricultural and agro-industrial products; (iv) support training workshops and \nseminars to share knowledge, information, and experience; (v) conduct high-level dialogue to ", "3 \ndevelop specific subregional strategies for dealing with GMS agriculture and rural development \nissues; (vi) organize subregional activities for joint applied research in agriculture and for \ndissemination  of  research  results;  and  (vii)  help  increase  business  opportunities  in  the \nagriculture and agro-industry sectors. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The methodologies and broad activities of the TA are to help WGA \n \n(i)  identify  areas  where  increased  subregional  cooperation  could  accelerate \nsustainable agricultural growth and poverty reduction; \n(ii)  formulate and implement the WGA's work programs for priority areas; \n(iii)  carry out studies on specific subregional issues that form a common concern \namong the GMS countries; \n(iv)  compile and refine information and data on agriculture and related activities in \nthe GMS; \n(v)  mobilize additional resources for the WGA's activities from the private sector and \nother external funding agencies involved in the agriculture sector in the GMS; \nand \n(vi)  facilitate dialogue and organize meetings, workshops, seminars, and training on \nthe priority issues in agriculture in the GMS. \n \n9.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  2  years  from  June  2003  to  June  2005.  A \ncomprehensive review of the progress and impact of the TA will be carried out during the \nsecond year when the need for further assistance to WGA is assessed. \n \n10.  Ownership of the WGA by the GMS countries is critical to the success of WGA activities. \nClose  consultation  between  the  GMS  countries  and  ADB  will  be  required  to  monitor  the \nprogress  of  TA  implementation  and  resolve  any  operational  issues  that  arise.  The  GMS \ncountries and ADB need to jointly ensure that priority in the work program is established and \nactivities implemented in a participatory manner. To maintain the strong sense of ownership of \nthe WGA by the GMS countries, it is important to ensure that the GMS countries have a \ncommon understanding of the WGA and its activities, and to assure that the WGA activities can \nbring about tangible results. The TA is designed to move quickly in areas where there is broad \nagreement on the need for action, and where tangible results can be expected in a relatively \nshort time. \n \n11.  To respond to the various needs and priorities of the GMS countries, the TA design has \nincorporated adequate flexibility and intensive supervision over the TA activities. Despite the \nneed to mobilize an increasing amount of resources for sustainable agricultural growth, the \navailable  financial  resources  have  been  declining.  Interested  regional  and  international \nagricultural research institutions, and  other external funding agencies will be invited to WGA \nmeetings as appropriate so that active consultations for expanding WGA activities can be \npromoted. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n12.  The total cost of the proposed TA is estimated at $356,000 equivalent, comprising \n$202,000 in foreign exchange and $154,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will finance \n$300,000 equivalent on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The GMS governments \nwill finance the remaining $56,000 in kind by providing counterpart staff, field transport, meeting ", "4 \nand seminar facilities, and other administrative expenses. The details of the cost estimates and \nfinancing arrangements are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will act as the Executing Agency for the TA. In 2002, the GMS countries nominated \ntheir WGA coordinators, who act as national focal points for implementing WGA activities under \nthe  small-scale  TA  (footnote  1).  Under  the  proposed  TA,  the  WGA  coordinators  will,  in \nconsultation with the concerned GMS national coordinators,3 continue to be responsible for \ncoordinating  the  views  and  relevant  activities  in  the  agriculture  sector  in  the  respective \ncountries. Effective partnerships need to be developed with farmers, agribusiness, traders, and \nbuyers, as well as with national, regional and international agriculture policy and research \ninstitutions. For this purpose, the GMS governments have already established working groups \nor committees headed by the WGA coordinators. In this context, active collaboration between \nthe CGIAR institutions and the WGA will be encouraged during the TA. Balanced gender \nrepresentation is crucial in the WGA activities. \n \n14.  The consulting services required for the TA comprise (i) 7 person-months of international \nconsultants4  in  regional  planning  and  team  leadership  (4  person-months),  information \nmanagement systems (2 person-months), and advice on agricultural policy (1 person-month); \nand (ii) 12 person-months of domestic consultants in various fields of agricultural research and \nanalysis  to  carry  out  short-term  studies.  The  consulting  services  will  be  provided  on  an \nindividual basis. The TA consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging \ndomestic consultants. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4.  The \ndetailed work plan and schedule of the consultants will be determined in consultation with the \nrespective countries in the GMS. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis for \nPromoting Partnerships to Accelerate Agriculture Development and Poverty Reduction in the \nGreater Mekong Subregion, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n3  The national coordinators were appointed by all the GMS countries to act as national focal points for the overall \nGMS subregional activities. \n4  International consultants will visit the concerned GMS countries and ADB headquarters as required.

Introduction \n \n1.  During the Tenth Ministerial Conference of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) in \nNovember 2001, the GMS countries reaffirmed the need to establish a working group on \nagriculture (WGA) to improve subregional cooperation in agriculture and to serve as an advisory \nbody to the ministerial-level conferences on priority agriculture issues. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) provided technical assistance to facilitate the establishment of the WGA.  In a \nworkshop held in Vientiane in July 2002, the participants agreed on the establishment of the \nWGA, and on a general framework for initiating WGA activities and formulating a draft work \nprogram. \n \nB.  WGA Goal and Objectives \n \n2.  The  WGA  will  be  a  forum  for  identifying  and  realizing  opportunities  to  increase \ncooperation in agriculture among the GMS countries. Regional cooperation is critical in (i) \nreducing poverty in the GMS, (ii) promoting equitable economic growth, (iii) promoting the \nsustainable use of natural resources for agricultural growth, and (iv) ensuring that the benefits of \nGMS infrastructure development reach rural communities. \n \nC.  Membership \n \n3.  Membership in the WGA is initially limited to the GMS governments. Representatives of \nregional and international institutions can be invited to attend the WGA meetings as appropriate, \ndepending on the issues to be discussed. The private sector and relevant nongovernment \norganizations  will  be  consulted  in  planning  and  implementing  WGA  activities.  The  GMS \ncountries designated their focal points for WGA activities, and established working groups or \ncommittees to coordinate national participation in the WGA. \n \nD.  Chairperson and Venue \n \n4.  The WGA members will determine the venues for WGA meetings. A representative of \nthe host country will serve as the chairperson of the particular WGA meeting. The chairperson \nwill provide the necessary technical and administrative support for the WGA activities. Initially, \nADB will act as the WGA secretariat and help facilitate WGA deliberations. The WGA will meet \nat least once a year to discuss and agree on its annual work program. \n  \nE.  Criteria for Selecting of WGA Proposals for Action \n \n5.  The criteria for selecting proposals to be taken up under the WGA work program follow: \n \n(i)  The WGA initiative addresses policy or technical issues in agriculture that have \nthe potential to increase farmers' income-generating opportunities, and contribute \nto poverty reduction and sustainable economic growth in the GMS. \n(ii)  The  initiative  will  contribute  to  improving  the  sustainability  of  agriculture \nproduction in the GMS. \n(iii)  The WGA initiative needs to benefit, and be requested by, two or more GMS \ncountries. \n(iv)  It  must  be  clear  that  the  issue  and  opportunity  being  addressed  can  be \naddressed more effectively at the regional than at the national level. \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \nF.  Scope of Work and Priorities \n \n6.  The WGA will be responsible for establishing priorities for WGA activities, help mobilize \nresources to implement these studies, and facilitate implementation of the studies. The initial \nsteps in developing concept papers for consideration follow \n \n(i)  Study  options  for  GMS  cooperation  in  training  and  educating  agricultural \ntechnicians and professional staff. \n(ii)  Develop an action plan for increased cooperation in research and development \nwithin the GMS, with focus on cooperation in biotechnology and technology-\ntransfer mechanisms. \n(iii)  Review  options,  and  propose  mechanisms,  for  effective  information \ndissemination and improved coordination of support to agricultural research and \ndevelopment. \n(iv)  Review options for GMS cooperation in developing market institutions to serve \nfarmers and promote commercial investment in agricultural production and agro-\nindustries, with focus on the linkage with the GMS flagship projects. \n(v)  Identify linkages in agricultural production and trade among the GMS countries \nand highlight the opportunities for increased investment in subregional production \nnetworks. \n(vi)  Evaluate and raise awareness of the potential impacts of an increasing demand \nfor higher quality, food safety, and environmental standards and certification in \nfood-importing countries. \n(vii)  Develop strategies for GMS cooperation to address priority issues in agriculture. \n(viii)  Review  current  initiatives  and  develop  strategic  options  for  cooperation  in \nmanaging natural resources and biodiversity to ensure sustainable agriculture \ndevelopment. \n(ix)  Undertake pilot studies on practical commercial opportunities and barriers to \nincreased flows of information and goods and services in the agriculture sector. \n(x)  Study the scope for increased cooperation in sharing research and technology \nrelating to agricultural mechanization. \n(xi)  Help develop a vision for enhancing poverty reduction in the GMS through \nsustainable  agriculture  development  that  reflects  changing  comparative \nadvantages in agriculture and agro-industries in the GMS. \n ", "Appendix 3     11 \n  COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n  ($) \n                                 \n              Foreign          Local       Total \n  Item     Exchange  Currency       Cost \n                         \n  A.
