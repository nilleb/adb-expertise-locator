INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is one of the key development partners in the \neducation sector in Nepal. ADB has been actively supporting the Government of Nepal in the \nongoing School Sector Reform Plan (SSRP) and the recently approved Skills Development \nProject.1 The capacity development technical assistance (TA) for Supporting Education and \nSkills Development is an outcome of a series of discussions with the government and other \nstakeholders.2 The  TA  responds  to  the  government\u2019s  high  priority  of  equitably  accessible, \nrelevant, and quality education to prepare its workforce to achieve sustainable, broad-based, \ninclusive  economic  growth,  as  intended  by  the  Three-Year  Plan  (FY2014\u2013FY2016).  The \ngovernment  concurred  with  the  design  and  monitoring  framework,  implementation \narrangements, costs and financing plan, and terms of reference in October 2013. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Achievements  in  school  education.  Nepal  has  made  substantial  progress  in \nenhancing access and equity, and modest progress in improving the efficiency and quality of \nschool education. The net enrollment rate in primary education (grades 1\u20135) has increased from \n92.0% (FY2009) to 95.3% (FY2013) and in basic education (grades 1\u20138) from 73.0% to 87.5%. \nGender parity in the net enrollment rate has been achieved in both primary and secondary \neducation. The percentage of teachers with the required qualification and training has reached \n91.5% in basic and 90.7% in secondary (grades 9\u201310) education. Dropout and repetition rates \nhave decreased and cycle completion rates have improved at all levels. This has led to more \nchildren  graduating  from  basic  education  and  continuing  to  secondary  education.  On  the \ninstitutional front, too, a decentralized educational management system is in place, under which \nschools are managed by school management committees whose core members are elected \nfrom among the parents. Professional support for and oversight of the schools occur through a \nnetwork  of  central  agencies  under  the  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE),  regional  education \ndirectorates,  district  education  offices,  and  resource  centers.  The  budget  process  is  also \ndecentralized and schools are entitled to central funding based on student enrollments and \nteacher positions, in addition to earmarked funds for various school management functions. \n \n3.  Remaining challenges in school education. Despite the progress, school education is \nstill characterized by low efficiency and weak governance, which are undermining the quality of \neducation. The repetition rates in grade 1 continue to be high at 19.9%, as do the dropout rates \nat 7.7%, and are much higher than the original targets set by the SSRP. Pass rates in the \nannual school-leaving certificate (grade 10 examination) are also below 50%, especially in the \npublic schools, where more than 80% of all students study. While more than 90% of teachers \nhave  required  qualification,  there  is  a  considerable  gap  between  teacher  training  and \nimprovement  in  classroom  pedagogy.  Inadequate  capacity  of  central  and  local  bodies, \ninsufficient internal control and compliance mechanisms, and a weak monitoring and evaluation \nsystem continue to constrain the effective implementation of the SSRP, locally in particular. The \nfinancing shortfall in the SSRP is also looming as one of the major issues that could derail the \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Policy-Based Grant \nand Technical Assistance Grant to Nepal for the School Sector Program. Manila; ADB. 2013. Report and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to Nepal for the Skills Development \nProject. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 October 2013.  \n ", "2 \nprogress in achieving its objective.3 Further, the SSRP envisaged a gradual increase in budget \nallocation to the education sector to 20% of the national budget; however, the government is \nfinding it a challenge to realize this target in the presence of competing needs from other \nsectors.4   \n \n4.  In the remaining period of the SSRP until FY2015, the government aims to (i) achieve \nEducation for All and Millennium Development Goal mission through accelerated interventions, \n(ii) rectify the SSRP course of actions based on its best practices, and (iii) develop the concept \nfor education beyond 2015 through regular and engaged technical discourse nationally and \nsubnationally. Development partners in the sector-wide approach agreed, in principle, to extend \nthe  current  joint  financing  agreement  to  meet  the  full  SSRP  period,  supporting  the  three \nobjectives.   \n  \n5.  Issues in technical and vocational education and training. Technical and vocational \neducation and training (TVET) in Nepal has a strong foundation anchored on the Council for \nTechnical  Education  and  Vocational  Training  (CTEVT),  Training  Institute  for  Technical \nInstruction,  and  National  Skills  Testing  Board.  Formal  TVET  is  provided  through  26 public \ninstitutes, 75 vocational units attached to district secondary schools (annex schools), and over \n450 privately run but publicly affiliated providers. The TVET system urgently needs improvement \nto realize Nepal\u2019s human resource potential and meet the government\u2019s objective of inclusive, \nemployment-oriented growth. Key problems undermining TVET performance are (i) insufficient, \ninequitable access; (ii) poor quality; (iii) low market relevance; and (iv) weak and outdated \ninstitutional capacity. In response, the government approved the TVET Policy, 2012 focusing on \nequitable access, quality, relevance, sustainable financing, and better coordination. \n \n6.  Institutional arrangement of education sector. All education subsectors in Nepal are \nunder the purview of MOE, supported by its suborgans for implementation. MOE is responsible \nfor policy and coordination, while the Department of Education (DOE) (for school education), \nCTEVT  (for  TVET),  University  Grants  Commission  (higher  education),  and  many  other \nspecialized agencies are responsible for implementation of the policies and programs. In school \neducation, the implementation responsibility is further decentralized to regional resource centers \nand regional resource persons, district education offices, and school management committees \nand parent and teacher associations. CTEVT management is largely centralized, although there \nhas been discussion of devolving it to and increasing the autonomy of training institutions. \nRecently, CTEVT established five regional offices for better implementation and monitoring of \ntraining activities.    \n \n7.  Key areas for capacity development needs. Capacity strengthening at all levels is \nrequired  to  successfully  implement  the  priority  reform  agenda  and  manage  effective  and \naccountable delivery of education services. Capacity development needs are vast and cannot \nbe met with available, limited resources, and therefore strategic interventions would be required. \nLessons  from  SSRP  implementation  and  TVET  involvement  indicate  two  priority  areas: \n(i) strengthening  policy  formulation, coordination,  and  the monitoring function  of  MOE;  and \n(ii) strengthening  the  capacity  of  front-line  service  providers  (e.g.,  school  management \ncommittees,  technical  institutions)  and  of  the  support  system  for  them  (regional  education \ndirectorates, resource centers, resource persons, and district education offices). \n                                                \n3  The joint annual review of the SSRP in May 2013 projected that the funding requirement for the plan in FY2014 is \n$747.14 million, of which expected allocation from the government and development partners amounts to $643.33 \nmillion. In this context, the total funding gap for the upcoming fiscal year is $103.81 million. \n4  For FY2012, 16.6% of the national budget was allocated to the education sector, out of which 68.9% was to basic \neducation, 16.7% to secondary education, and 1.45% to CTEVT.    \n ", "  3 \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n8.  The TA is proposed to support MOE and its agencies in (i) enhancing their capacity in \npolicy formulation, coordination, and monitoring of policy implementation led by the Education \nPolicy Committee (EPC); and (ii) implementing the capacity development plan, especially for \nlocal and regional service providers.5 These will contribute not only to the completion of the \ncurrent SSRP (extended until FY2015) but also to education program formulation beyond 2015. \nThe TA will support (i) the TVET Sector Development Unit (TSDU) under EPC of MOE in \nimproving coordination, and (ii) the Research and Planning Division of CTEVT in skills gap \nanalysis and skills forecasting. The TA will enable ADB\u2019s continued and critical engagement in \nthe education sector through (i) strategic policy dialogues by providing timely and high-quality \ntechnical inputs, (ii) multi-stakeholder engagement for broad-based ownership in any proposed \nreform and policy actions by ensuring adequate public consultations in key reform issues, \n(iii) support for implementation capacity development, and (iv) assistance for new program and \nproject design.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact will be greater efficiency and inclusiveness of school education and TVET. \nThe outcome will be stronger government capacity for planning, coordinating, and implementing \nkey reforms; and inclusive, results-oriented school education and skills development programs. \nThe TA will assist MOE and help related agencies carry out key studies and stakeholder \nconsultations, and ensure that the ensuing programs are technically sound in design, results-\noriented, based on stakeholder consensus, and have adequate implementation arrangements, \nincluding plans for sustainable long-term financing and built-in capacity development plans.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The activities of the TA will be carried out in consultation with MOE and other agencies \nconcerned to ensure their ownership and effectiveness of TA input utilization. MOE and the \nagencies will assign counterpart officials to work with TA consultants to ensure knowledge and \nknow-how transfer to the counterpart officials. Inclusiveness has been a central theme to the \ngovernment\u2019s development strategy. The TA will build on previous experience in gender and \nsocially inclusive education initiatives and ensure that any ensuing plans and implementation \nefforts will continuously and consciously incorporate measures to promote equity in access. The \nTA will have the following outputs: \n \n(i)  Output  1:  Policy  formulation,  coordination,  and  monitoring  of \nimplementation improved. It aims at (a) providing substantive policy advisory \nand technical inputs in the areas of school education reform (advanced teaching \nand learning methodologies, teacher development, and decentralized education \nmanagement) as identified by the SSRP extension; and (b) building the key \nagency officials\u2019 capacity, especially EPC\u2019s capacity to develop, coordinate, and \nmonitor implementation of policy actions based on the technical inputs. The latter \nwill contribute to the government\u2019s post-2015 program development. The TSDU \nwithin the EPC will be strengthened to develop a road map and accompanying \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmedium-term expenditure framework for TVET, which will be the basis for better \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                \n5  Includes school management committees, head teachers, school teachers, and other supporting systems at the \ndistrict and regional levels. \n ", "4 \ncoordination between several ministries delivering training programs. A TVET \nfund mechanism will be developed as a single financing window, as envisaged in \nthe TVET Policy, 2012. Together with the road map, the TVET fund will help the \ngovernment  prepare  a  platform  for  a  more  sector-wide  approach  to  TVET. \nMeasures to build an enabling environment for private sector investment and \nparticipation  in  TVET  and  school  education  will  be  explored  in  view  of \ngovernment resource constraint but increasing private spending and investment \nin education. A baseline survey will be conducted to inform policy options in \nprivate sector financing (such as training levy, enterprise-based training, and \npublic\u2013private partnership in school education and skills development).  \n \n(ii)  Output  2:  Capacity  development  plan  supported.  Under  the  SSRP,  a \ncomprehensive capacity development framework was developed, but it was not \noperationalized. An institutional review completed in September 2013 informed \nan action plan to strengthen  the SSRP implementation arrangements. Some \nshort-term actions will be taken up by SSRP and as School Sector Program \n(SSP) third-tranche conditions, but MOE, DOE, and schools will require technical \nsupport to implement medium- and longer-term actions. Most of all, any capacity \ndevelopment efforts should be relevant to improving students\u2019 learning outcomes. \nOutput 2 will support the implementing agencies in introducing reform measures, \nsuch as (a) preparing and piloting a performance-based appraisal mechanism for \nbetter accountability of service providers,6 and (b) strengthening internal control, \ncompliance mechanisms, and monitoring and evaluation systems and improving \nthe  capacity  of  stakeholders,  especially  local  ones,  to  implement  those \nmechanisms  and  systems  on  a  pilot  basis.  Any  new  mechanism  will  be \nthoroughly  discussed  with  stakeholders  to  ensure  ownership  and  effective \nimplementation. Mechanisms developed through the pilot implementation and \nlessons learned will inform the design of proposed follow-on of SSP. For TVET, \nthe TA will develop the capacity of the Research and Planning Division of CTEVT \nin conducting skills gap analysis and skills need forecasting. Output 2 will also \nsupport  the  government  in  meeting  SSP  third-tranche  conditions  and \nimplementing the Skills Development Project, as necessary.  \n \n(iii)  Output 3: Education development interventions defined. With output 1, it is \nexpected that EPC and TSDU will be able to lead education sector dialogue and \nconsultations, and develop plans and programs for the next phase. Output 3 will \nprovide  any  additional  resources  required  for  project  preparation  including  \ndesigning  new  education  and  TVET  initiatives,  feasibility  studies,  and  due \ndiligence  required  for  investment  programs  and  projects  and  TA  for  ADB\u2019s \nfinancing consideration.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,110,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \n                                                \n6  These include teachers, head teachers, district education offices, regional centers, regional education directorates, \nDOE, and other central department level entities. Key performance indicators will be developed for each function, \nfocusing on their roles in ensuring student\u2019s learning outcome. It is hoped that this can highlight the multifaceted \nchallenges in increasing student\u2019s learning outcome and also increase accountability of respective parties involved \nin education service delivery. Further reform actions, resource allocation, capacity development can be also fine-\ntuned in the areas where performance is lagging behind.  \n ", "  5 \ncounterpart support in the form of office accommodation, counterpart officials and other staff \ntime, coordination support, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  MOE  will  be  the  executing  agency.  It  will  form  a  TA  steering  committee  with \nrepresentation  from  the  National  Planning  Commission,  Ministry  of  Finance,  DOE,  TSDU, \nCTEVT, and other agencies concerned. Under the guidance of the steering committee, MOE \nwill also establish a working group in each subsector, responsible for specific deliverables. MOE, \nDOE, TSDU, and CTEVT will assign officials whose functions and roles are most relevant to the \nTA activities to work with the TA consultants to ensure ownership and sustainability of TA inputs \nas well as knowledge and know-how transfer. Counterpart officials will be required to develop \nthe consultant terms of reference and monitor progress of deliverables by consultants. Pre- and \npost-engagement questionnaires will be used to measure the effectiveness of TA inputs from \nthe perspective of the counterpart officials.   \n \n13.  The  TA  will  provide  22 person-months  of  international  consultants  and  50 person-\nmonths of national consultants. ADB will engage the consultants as individuals (48 person-\nmonths) and through a firm (24 person-months) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The firm selection will follow the \nquality- and cost-based selection method (90:10 quality\u2013cost ratio), using bio-data technical \nproposal as the contract would be less than $600,000. All TA-financed goods will be procured in \nline with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). Disbursements \nunder  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will be implemented over 24 months \nwith  expected  commencement  in  January  2014  and  completion  in  December  2015.  The \nconsultant requirements and terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n    \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Nepal for Supporting Education and Skills Development, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact  By 2017 (for all indicators):    Risk \nGreater efficiency and    Political transition \nIncrease in mean years of  DOE annual report \ninclusiveness of school  may distract the \nschooling (15 years old and   \neducation and TVET  government\u2019s \nabove) to 10 years (male and   \n  focus from key \nfemale) (2011 baseline: 8.1   \nreforms \nyears [males: 8.2 years,   \nfemales: 8.0 years])    \n \nDOE annual report \nIncrease in share of Dalit \n \nstudents in secondary grades \n \nto 13% (2011 baseline: 10%) \n \nAt least 15,500 students have  CTEVT annual report \ncompleted TSLCs or   \ndiplomas and 86,200 trainees \nhave completed short-term \ncourses (2012 baseline: \n13,300 students for TSLCs or \ndiplomas and 46,200 trainees \nin short-term courses)  \nOutcome  By 2015 (for all indicators):    Assumption \n \nStronger government    Revenue \nA new school sector program  MOE approval  \ncapacity for planning,  generation \nand medium-term   \ncoordinating, and  improves to \nexpenditure framework   \nimplementing key  support increased \napproved by MOE   \nreforms; and inclusive,    investment in \nTVET road map and TVET  MOE and MOF approval \nresults-oriented school  secondary \nfund mechanism adopted by \neducation and skills  education and \nthe government  \ndevelopment programs   skills development \nOutputs  By 2015 (for all indicators):    Risk \nFavorable rating of SSRP \n1.
