INTRODUCTION \n1.  The 1997 Asian financial crisis underscored the need for the region to develop bond \nmarkets as an alternative funding source to bank loans. A combination of excessive reliance on \nforeign currency loans, inadequate hedging, poor corporate governance, and weak financial \nregulation were the primary causes of the crisis. Since the crisis, policy makers in the region \nhave undertaken structural reforms to improve corporate governance in financial institutions and \ncorporations, and strengthen financial supervision. They also reached a consensus on the need \nto promote the development of a regional bond market to ensure the availability of long-term \ndomestic currency funding, prevent maturity and currency mismatches, mobilize the region\u2019s \nsavings for regional investment, and promote regional financial stability. \n \n2.  Thus, the Forum of Finance Ministers of members of the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations  (ASEAN),  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Japan,  and  the  Republic  of  Korea \n(collectively ASEAN+3) established the Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI) in 2003. The ABMI \npromotes the development of a regional bond market, in particular by facilitating access to this \nmarket by a wide variety of issuers, and removing policy and regulatory impediments.  \n \n3.  Members identified four priority areas essential to building a deep and well-functioning \nbond market: (i) the creation of new securitized debt instruments; (ii) the establishment of a \ncredit  guarantee  and  investment  mechanism  (CGIM);  (iii)  the  establishment  of  a  regional \nsettlement and clearance system; and (iv) the enhancement of credit rating systems. These \nactivities  aim  to  generate  a  larger  volume  of  new  bond  issuances  denominated  in  Asian \ncurrencies,  improve  the  flow  of  credit  information  on  debt  issuers,  and  build  the  market \ninfrastructure to support cross-border issuance and investment. \n \n4.  The ABMI Task Force 1, cochaired by the People\u2019s Republic of China and Thailand, has \nrequested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to administer a technical assistance (TA) project \nthat will make the necessary preparations for the establishment of CGIM. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The concept paper of the TA was approved by the \nmanaging director general on 29 April 2009.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  ADB  has  funded  two  TA  projects  for  the  establishment of  CGIM.  The  first  project, \nASEAN+3 Regional Guarantee Mechanism, established that there was sufficient demand for \nthe facility and a market gap to be filled, and so it was essential for the facility to have a high \ncredit rating. Various organizational options were presented for consideration.2 \n \n6.  The  second  project,  ASEAN+3  Regional  Guarantee  and  Investment  Mechanism \nPhase 2,  undertook a more detailed assessment of the organizational options. Phase 2 fleshed \nout the structure and key elements of CGIM, including financial and operational policies, human \nresource policies, governance structure, demand estimates, and detailed financial projections to \ndetermine capital requirements.3 Based on the results of the TA, ASEAN+3 members agreed on \nthe following key points with regard to CGIM. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 June 2009. \n2  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for ASEAN+3 Regional Guarantee Mechanism. Manila (TA 6127-REG, approved \non 27 October, $500,000). A supplementary budget amounting to $435,000 was approved on 5 January 2005. \n3  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for ASEAN+3 Regional Guarantee and Investment Mechanism Phase 2. Manila \n(TA 6373-REG, approved on 18 December, $500,000). A supplementary budget amounting to $400,000 was \napproved on 9 December 2008. \n ", "2   \n \n7.  First, the rationale for establishing CGIM is to promote the development of domestic and \nregional bond markets by improving companies\u2019 access to bond markets. Its main purpose is to \nprovide credit guarantees to domestic and cross-border issuers seeking to meet their funding \nneeds in local currencies. Its role is to address market failures and fill a gap in the market by \nenhancing investment grade issuers\u2019 access to debt markets. This means that CGIM will offer \nfinancial services not currently available in the market, and complement products currently \noffered by financial institutions. It will not compete with existing financial institutions. To ensure \nits effectiveness, CGIM must have an AAA rating. \n \n8.  Based on the outcome of the demand study completed in 2008 and depending on the \nsize of its operations, CGIM could significantly address current market failures evident in the \nvery restricted access for potential bond issues (rated below AA but above investment grade \nBBB) and the short-term maturity of local currency bonds. The absence of local institutions that \nprovide third party guarantees for local bond issues as a business line is a critical market gap \nthat CGIM would be able to fill. Market analysis shows that two main groups of issuers will \nparticularly benefit from CGIM\u2019s services: corporate bond issuers and companies engaged in \npublic\u2013private partnership projects. CGIM will make it possible for corporate issuers to raise \nfunds for medium- to long-term projects, by providing an alternative source of funds to bank \nloans, and lowering the refinancing risk for investment grade issuers. It should also prove \nattractive to companies engaged in public\u2013private partnership projects by enabling them to (i) \nraise long-term funding to finance capital expenditure against projected cash flows, (ii) match \nliabilities with assets, and (iii) reduce the refinancing risk. CGIM will also make it possible for a \ncompany  in  ASEAN+3  to  issue  bonds  in  any  of  the  13  member  countries  with  its  credit \nguarantee. \n \n9.  Second, CGIM will be established as a trust fund of ADB. Its corporate governance will \nbe guided by international best practice. CGIM\u2019s governance structure aims to ensure that \nCGIM is managed and operated in the best interests of its contributors and stakeholders, and \nthat the purposes and objectives of CGIM are achieved in the most efficient, accountable, \ntransparent, and socially responsible manner. CGIM will have operational independence and \nwill be governed and operated according to its own articles of agreement, which lay down the \ncorporate governance structure of CGIM.  \n \n10.  The highest decision-making organ of CGIM will be the meeting of contributors\u2014the \nprincipal mechanism by which contributors exercise ownership, governance, and control rights \nand responsibilities. It determines the strategic objectives of CGIM, decides on the use and \ndistribution  of  profits,  appoints  the  members  of  its  board  of  directors,  and  reviews  the \noperational and financial performance of CGIM. The board of directors, the second highest \ndecision-making body, will lead, guide, and perform oversight over executive management. It \nwill ensure that management operates in the best interests of the contributors, and that the \nstrategic decisions of the meeting of contributors are fully and efficiently implemented. \n \n11.  Executive decision-making powers are vested in the executive committee, which reports \nand is accountable to the board of directors, and ultimately to the contributors. The executive \ncommittee will be headed by a chief executive officer who is appointed by the trustee upon the \napproval of the meeting of the contributors. CGIM\u2019s main business of providing guarantees of \nbond issues and investments requires a robust and rigorous system of risk assessment and \nmanagement at the operational level in the form of a guarantee and investment committee. The \nboard of directors will determine the committee\u2019s membership and specific mandate. Other \n ", "  3\ncommittees may be created at the executive level where appropriate and as determined by the \nboard of directors and the chief executive officer. \n \n12.  Third, as announced by the ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers\u2019 Meeting on 3 May 2009, CGIM \nwill be established with an initial capital of $500 million on a pilot basis. CGIM\u2019s capital, which \nwill be fully paid-in (not callable), will be increased once the initial amount is fully committed. \nSubsequently, however, ASEAN+3 has agreed to raise the initial capital of CGIM up to $700 \nmillion. CGIM will not borrow from any source and will operate strictly on the basis of its paid-in \ncapital to limit shareholders\u2019 exposure to their contribution to the paid-in capital. To ensure \nfinancial viability and for CGIM to maintain an AAA international rating, it will operate strictly on \ncommercial  principles,  adopt  international  best  practice  in  risk  management,  and  avoid \nproviding guarantees to issuers or borrowers with a high probability of default, even during an \neconomic downturn. It will also comply with all relevant ADB operational policies, including the \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date),  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the \nFinancing of Terrorism Policy (2003), and Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n13.  Fourth, to ensure the effectiveness and integrity of its operations, CGIM will keep core \noperational functions in-house, and will not outsource these operations to a third party. In line \nwith international best practice, human resource policy will be based on market-related criteria \nand remuneration. This will enable CGIM to attract and retain professionals with the skills and \nexpertise necessary to effectively manage and operate CGIM and retain its core operational \nfunctions in-house. Senior executives, including the chief executive officer, chief investment or \nrisk  officer,  the  finance  director, and  other  senior  members  of  management  will  be  highly \nqualified professionals recruited through an international, open, and competitive process. \n \n14.  Fifth, ASEAN+3 member countries have agreed to convene technical meetings over the \nfirst half of 2010 to further discuss and agree on a CGIM business plan, capital subscription \namong member countries and ADB, a leverage ratio, and other key elements. It is expected that \nCGIM will be ready to start operations by the first half of 2011. Lastly, at the Minister of Finance \nand Central Bank Deputies' Meeting held in November 2009, ASEAN+3 member countries have \nagreed to change the name of CGIM to Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility (CGIF) to give \na better indication of CGIM functions. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n15.  The TA will assist ASEAN+3 members finalize CGIF capital structure, its business plan, \nand operational policies. The TA will also prepare for the start-up operations of CGIF, including \nthe recruitment of CGIF management team and senior staff. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  The impact of the TA will be a more integrated and stronger regional financial system by \n(i) helping to reduce borrowers\u2019 dependency on the banking system and minimizing currency \nand maturity mismatches, and (ii) facilitating cross-border bond issuance. The outcome of the \nTA will be the smooth and timely establishment of CGIF and the prompt commencement of \noperations on the basis of the proposed business plan drawn up in phase 2 and subsequent \nagreements reached by the ASEAN+3 members. \n \n \n \n ", "4   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n17.  The following activities will be undertaken under the TA: \n \n(i)  Organization of capital subscriptions and their payment. With the agreement \non an initial $700 million capitalization for CGIF, ASEAN+3 member countries will \nfinalize (i) the arrangements for capital subscription by individual members and \nfor payment of the subscriptions, and (ii) the terms of reference for CGIF board of \ndirectors and its three committees (for remuneration, audit, and internal control \nand risk management).  \n \n(ii)  Development  of  financial  projections  and  related  documents.  Once \ncapitalization  and subscription  issues  are  resolved  and  agreed  upon,  a  final \nreview of financial projections will be undertaken and a business plan will be \nprepared.  \n \n(iii)  Acquiring an international credit rating. Before actual business operations \nstart, CGIF will acquire its own credit rating to enhance the value of guarantees. \nThe TA will help in the preparation of all necessary documents for submission to \nthe credit rating agencies. \n \n(iv)  Recruitment of CGIF staff by a recruitment firm. As CGIF will be operated as \nan internationally AAA rated credit guarantee entity, its management team and \nsenior staff will have to be highly qualified and will be recruited through an \ninternational, open, and competitive process.  \n \n(v)  Road  shows  on  CGIF.  For  CGIF  to  provide  credit  guarantees  to  as  many \npotential  issuers  as  possible,  it  must  become  known  to  both  issuers  and \ninvestors. Road shows on CGIF will be conducted in all major ASEAN+3 cities \nincluding  Bangkok,  Ho  Chi  Minh  City,  Hong  Kong,  Jakarta,  Kuala  Lumpur, \nManila, Phnom Penh, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, and Tokyo. \n \n(vi)  Reinsurance.  Discussions  will  be  held  with  various  financial  institutions \n(including KfW and China Reinsurance Company) to reinsure the contingent \nliabilities of CGIF. \n \n(vii)  Acquisition  of  office  equipment.  This  will  include  procuring  basic  office \nequipment, determining and designing the IT system required to start operations, \nand providing various services including accounting, legal, and personnel. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,370,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  Investment  Climate  Facilitation  Fund  under  the  Regional  Cooperation  and \nIntegration Financing Partnership Facility, and administered by ADB.4 The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n4  Established by the Government of Japan. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The TA will be administered by the Office of Regional Economic Integration (OREI) in \ncoordination with ASEAN+3. The design and monitoring framework presented in Appendix 1 will \nbe used to track and evaluate progress in implementation.  \n \n20.   Six international consultants will be engaged for a total of 21 person-months, while three \nnational consultants will be engaged for a total of 22 person-months and stationed in OREI to \nprovide support to the international consultants. These consultants will be engaged individually \nby ADB in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n21.  The recruitment of CGIF senior staff will be undertaken by a specialist from a recruitment \nfirm, given that the nature of the assignment entails a single and specific task. The firm will be \nselected on the basis of quality and cost using a simplified technical proposal. \n \n22.  The procurement of basic equipment for CGIF office will be carried out in accordance \nwith the ADB Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \n23.  The TA will be implemented over 16 months beginning February 2010 and is expected \nto be completed by June 2011. Consultations and meetings with ASEAN+3 members will be \nconducted to finalize details of the capital subscription and payment, and operational plans. The \nfinancial statements of CGIF will be prepared for submission to credit rating agencies to obtain \nthe  international  credit  rating  of  CGIF.  Discussions  will  be  held  with  financial  institutions \n(including  KfW  and  China  Reinsurance  Company)  that  will  provide  reinsurance for  CGIF\u2019s \npotential  liabilities  net  of  its  paid-in  capital,  and  a  reinsurance  agreement  between  the \nparticipating institutions and ADB will be drafted.  \n \n24.  Road shows will be conducted in all ASEAN+3 member countries to raise awareness \nand promote interest in CGIF\u2019s financial products. All knowledge products from the TA will be \ndisseminated  through  road  shows,  workshops,  and  seminars.  Information  on  CGIF  will  be \nposted on the Asian Bonds Online website. \n \nIV.
