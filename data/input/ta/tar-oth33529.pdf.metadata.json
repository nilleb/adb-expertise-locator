INTRODUCTION\n1.  By  all  definitions  of  poverty,  disabled  people  in  developing  countries  are\noverrepresented among the poor. The majority live in rural areas. Social exclusion and\nisolation are a frequent part of their daily experience.1 Two thirds of disabled people are\nestimated to be without employment. Often, the disabled are deprived of the opportunity\nto participate in productive work, and thus become impoverished more easily than the\nrest of the population. Poverty also causes new disabilities as a result of poor and\ndangerous living and work conditions; malnutrition; and lack of adequate health care,\neducation, and vocational training opportunities. Therefore, poverty is both a cause and\na consequence of disability. Poverty and disability reinforce each other, contributing to\nincreased  vulnerability  and  exclusion.  Eliminating  world  poverty  is  unlikely  to  be\nachieved unless the rights and needs of excluded people and disabled people are taken\ninto account.\n2.  This  regional  technical  assistance  (TA)2  aims  to  raise  awareness  of  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) staff and the developing member countries (DMCs) of the\nimportance of disability as a development issue.  The TA will provide guidance on how to\n(i) improve ADB\u2019s responsiveness to the needs, concerns, and potential of people with\ndisabilities and (ii) include them when operationalizing ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy.\nThe scope, cost estimates, and implementation arrangements of the TA reflect the\nfindings of the July 2000 Fact-Finding Mission to Cambodia, India, and the Philippines.\nII.        BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3.  One of three Asians is poor; about 900 million poor people live in the region.\nAccording to the United Nations, 1 person in 20 has a disability and more than 75\npercent of these live in developing countries.3 More often than not, they are among the\npoorest of the poor. Disabled people are the most marginalized group in the Asian and\nPacific region. In all societies, people with disabilities tend to be more vulnerable to\npoverty and excluded from mainstream society than those who do not have disabilities.\nDisability limits access to education and employment, and leads to economic and social\nexclusion. Poor people with disabilities are caught in a vicious cycle of poverty and\ndisability, each being both a cause and a consequence of the other.  Indicative evidence\non poverty and disability is abundant, but comprehensive studies on the linkages are not\navailable.4   The lack of comprehensive information on the poverty of disabled people is\nanother indicator of their marginalized and invisible status.\n4.  Many disabled people are also disadvantaged by social, economic, physical, and\npolitical  conditions.    Together,  these  conditions  constitute  barriers  to  freedom  of\nmovement in society, thus hampering their full participation. These barriers include the\nstigma of disability, and poor understanding of the abilities and aspirations of disabled\n                                                          \n1 Kauppinen, L. 1995.

Because  of  this,  disabled  people  often  face  a  life  that  is  segregated  and\ndebased; many live in isolation and insecurity.\n5.  Women and girls with disabilities are often excluded from mainstream gender\nequity  programs.  They  suffer  double  discrimination,  on  the  grounds  of  gender  and\nimpairment, and their literacy rates are lower than of their male counterparts. According\nto a Department for International Development (DFID) report, disabled women are two to\nthree times more likely to be victims of physical and sexual abuse than women with no\ndisabilities. Their access to reproductive health care is also minimal; as a result, they\nsuffer greater vulnerability to reproductive health problems.5  Children and young people\nwith disabilities have fewer opportunities to be part of education and skill development\nprograms.  Recent  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization\n(UNESCO) studies suggest that only 1\u20132 percent of disabled children in developing\ncountries receive an education. Girls with disabilities have even less access to school\nthan boys with disabilities.6\n6.  As  countries  within  the  Asian  and  Pacific  region  develop  and  modernize,\nchanges occur in the disability profile.  With the rise in smoking habits and environmental\npollution, disabilities associated with chronic nonspecific lung diseases are expected to\nincrease significantly.  Mental disabilities such as depression and alcohol abuse are also\nbecoming more prominent. Furthermore, with populations aging, disabilities associated\nwith increasing longevity, such as muscular diseases, will also increase. In addition, road\ntraffic accidents in developing countries have received relatively little attention from\npublic health experts.\n7.  In the last two decades, awareness of disability issues has increased and several\nsignificant landmarks were attained at the international and national levels. 1981 was\ndeclared  International  Year  of  Disabled  Persons.  Following  this,  1983-1992  was\nproclaimed  by  the  United  Nations  (UN)  General  Assembly  as  the  UN  Decade  for\nDisabled Persons. The major outcome of the decade was the emergence of a global\nmovement recognizing the importance of integrating people with disabilities into society\nthrough a world program of action.\n8.  The governments of the Asian and Pacific region made a historic decision in the\nconcluding year of The UN Decade of Disabled Persons.  The Economic and Social\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), at its forty-eighth session in April 1992\ndeclared 1993-2002 as the Asian and Pacific Decade of Disabled Persons.  The unique\nregional initiative started at a meeting convened by ESCAP at Beijing in December\n1992.    That  meeting  formulated  and  adopted  two  key  decade  documents:  the\nproclamation on the full participation and equality of people with disabilities in the Asian\nand Pacific region, and the agenda for action for the Asian and Pacific Decade of\nDisabled Persons.\n9.  Following the Asian and Pacific Decade of Disabled Persons, several DMCs\npassed  comprehensive  legislation  to  protect  the  rights  of  disabled  people.7  These\n                                                          \n5 Department of International Development. 2000.

Although the DMCs\nmay make genuine efforts to implement laws and regulation on disability issues, they\noften lack the skills, resources, conceptual understanding, and institutional capacity to\nrespond adequately to the needs of the disabled.\n10.  A recent survey in Cambodia estimated that disabled people comprise about 1.4\nmillion or 15 percent of the total population.8 Apart from congenital reasons and illness,\ndisability in Cambodia has been caused by the long and severe war in the country.\nAlthough the war ended more than 20 years ago, one of its consequences is the high\npercentage of disabled people among the population, especially those with mobility\nhandicap.\n11.  In 1991, the Indian National Sample Survey Organization indicated that in India,\nover 90 million people are disabled, of which 12 million are blind, 28.5 million have low\nvision,  12  million  have  speech  and  hearing  defects,  6  million  are  orthopedically\nhandicapped, 24 million are mentally retarded, 7.5 million are mentally ill, and 1.1. million\npersons have leprosy-related handicaps. In a majority of countries including India, the\nlack of inclusion of rehabilitation services in the regular health care services results in a\nhigher death rate for disabled infants and children.  Disabled children and youths rarely\nreceive a formal education.  It is difficult for disabled adolescents and adults to gain\naccess to vocational training, and persons with disabilities  are rarely entrusted with\nfamily  and  community  responsibilities.  While  India  has  formulated  broad  policies,\nstrategies, and plans to include people with disabilities as stated in the Disability Act\n1995, implementation is often weak.\n12.  In the Philippines, groups and organizations of disabled people play a strong role\nat the national and international levels. State policies relating to the rights of disabled\npeoples are quite well developed. The Magna Carta for Disabled Persons also known as\nRepublic Act No. 7277 of 1957 affirms the full participation and total integration of\npersons with disabilities into the mainstream of Philippine society.  Furthermore, the\nPhilippine National Antipoverty Action Agenda launched in July 2000 and responsible for\npoverty reduction policy and programming, includes persons with disabilities as 1 of the\n10 groups vulnerable to poverty.  The agenda envisions a country where the disabled\ncan expect \u201cenjoyment and full participation in a barrier-free society inclusively in all\nfacets of society, especially education.\u201d  Thus, at the highest level, the Philippines\naddresses the needs of the disabled as part of its overall strategy to reduce poverty.\n13.  ADB recently adopted poverty reduction as its overarching goal.9 This goal is\nhighly relevant from the perspective of the prevention of disabling conditions, generation\nof appropriate support services and structures, and the equalization of opportunities for\ndisabled people to contribute to poverty reduction, as well as to socially sensitive and\npro-poor economic development.\n                                                          \n8  United Nations. 1999.

Objectives\n14.  The objectives of the TA are to (i) familiarize the DMCs with ADB\u2019s overarching\nobjective  of  poverty  reduction  and  other  related  ADB  policies  to  help  address  the\nvulnerability  and  poverty  situation  of  disabled  peoples;  (ii)  identify  and  analyze  the\nDMCs\u2019 national policies, programs, projects, and initiatives concerning disabilities and\npoverty  to  be  used  as  a  basis  for  action  plans;  (iii)  provide  a  forum  for  ADB,\nGovernment, and disabled peoples\u2019 groups and organizations to identify and discuss\ndisabled peoples\u2019 needs and concerns particularly those related to poverty; and (iv)\ndevelop a disability checklist for ADB.  The TA framework is in Appendix 1.\nB.  Scope\n15.  The  TA  will  support  the  following  activities  in  Cambodia,  India,  and  the\nPhilippines. The first phase will consist of developing background and issue papers to\nassess country experiences, and analyze the connection between disability and poverty\nreduction.  The background paper will examine priority issues within each country to\naddress the needs of disabled people. The paper will be developed in consultation and\nliaison with key actors, including governments, international agencies, nongovernment\norganizations, representatives of disabled people, and relevant regional bodies in Asia,\ndrawing  on  their  experience  and  analysis.  The  paper  will  be  discussed  in  national\nworkshops in each DMC involving key stakeholders. The national workshop will build\nawareness about disability issues among stakeholders including government and civil\nsociety.  Based on the findings, potential areas and modalities will be identified for future\nADB operational policy dialogues, macroeconomic and sector work, TAs, and loans in\naddressing disability issues.\n16.  The second phase of the TA will consist of a regional workshop involving key\nstakeholders from 10 DMCs: Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China,  Fiji Islands, India,\nIndonesia,  Kazakhstan,  Sri  Lanka,  Thailand,  Uzbekistan,  and  Viet  Nam.  Broader\nregionwide concerns related to poverty reduction and disabled people will be discussed.\nA synthesis overview report will be prepared.  Representatives of other international\nagencies will be invited to share information during the workshop.\n17.  Drawing from the background paper and consultations with each DMC, during\nthe final phase of the TA, the consultant will review ADB\u2019s existing policies, guidelines,\nand staff instructions, and prepare a regional strategy and checklist on disability and\npoverty in key sectors where ADB is active and that are relevant to disability concerns.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n18.  The total cost of the TA estimated to be $300,000 equivalent will be financed by\nADB on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program.  The detailed cost estimates\nare provided in Appendix 2.", "5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n19.  The TA will be implemented over six months and is expected to commence in the\nfirst quarter of 2001. The TA requires the services of one international consultant for 5\nperson-months and three domestic consultants for a total of 12 person-months. All\nconsultants will have background in social sciences and significant experience with\ndisability and poverty issues. The consultants will be selected on an individual basis and\nengaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and\nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  selection  and  engagement  of\nconsultants. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3.\n20.  During the first month, the international consultant will (i) attend an inception\nmeeting at ADB headquarters; (ii) finalize the checklist outline through discussions with\nthe Social Development Division, the Poverty Reduction Unit, and key counterparts in\nagencies responsible for incorporating disability concerns in each DMC; (iii) assist in\nselecting domestic consultants; and (iv) prepare an inception report setting out the\nproposed work plan for the TA.  The interim report and country work plan are due at the\nend of month two, and month four, respectively.  The national workshops will take place\nin month three, the regional workshop in month four, and the draft final report in month\nfive.\n21.  ADB will execute the TA through its Social Development Division.  In each\nselected country, the participating agencies will include, as appropriate, the ministries or\ndepartments  of  social  welfare  and  local  government,  together  with  civil  society\norganizations.\nIV.        THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved\nthe provision of a technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the\nequivalent of $300,000 for the purpose of Technical Assistance for Identifying Disability\nIssues Related to Poverty Reduction and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "Appendix 1, page 1\n6\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Performance Monitoring Assumptions\nTargets Mechanisms and Risks\nGoal\nInclude and mainstream Develop a framework and Technical assistance Disabled people are\ndisability concerns into the action plan to address the (TA) report,  and recognized as significant\nimplementation of the Asian needs of disabled people to evaluation from the actors in development,\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) reduce poverty. national and regional contributing to the\npolicy framework of poverty workshops development process to\nreduction and social reduce poverty.\ndevelopment.\nPurpose\n\u2022  To engage in \u2022  Develop a theme paper \u2022  Development of \u2022  TA outcomes may not\nconsultation and on disability concerns effective theme be appropriate or\ndialogue with key and poverty reduction papers effective.\nstakeholders through as a foundation for \u2022  Identification of\nwhich ADB can gain the consultation and an appropriate\nknowledge, dialogue. structure for\nexperiences, and views \u2022  Identify an appropriate consultations\nof disability dimensions approach to \u2022  Development of\nto be incorporated as consultation and an appropriate\nappropriate in the dialogue that will serve strategy paper\nimplementation of the interests of all and action plan\nADB\u2019s and the participants.\ndeveloping member \u2022  Develop a strategy\ncountries\u2019 (DMC) paper and action plan to\npoverty reduction and address disability\nsocial development concerns with the\nstrategies poverty reduction\nstrategy.\n\u2022  To increase awareness, \u2022  Prepare three sets of \u2022  Workshop \u2022  Key stakeholders on\ncommitment, and case studies and initial reports and disability concerns\npractice of selected plans of action for outputs and poverty reduction\nDMCs to incorporate Cambodia, India, and programs and\ndisability concerns on Philippines at the projects will\nthe poverty reduction workshops. participate.\nstrategy \u2022  Receive three positive \u2022  Reports and \u2022  Other international\nnational workshop evaluations for agencies will attend\nevaluations. national workshops.\nworkshops\nComponents/Outputs\nCountry analysis and Stakeholder analysis and Country report \u2022  Delay or difficulty in\nworkshop for three selected consultations identifying an\ncountries in incorporating appropriate\ndisability dimensions on consultation\npoverty reduction strategy mechanism\n\u2022  Unsatisfactory\nconsultations\n\u2022  Data are not available\nReview of disability policy Country report for review\nand poverty reduction policy \u2022  Delay in execution of\nand implementation of workshop\nrecommendations\n(Reference in text: page 4, para. 14)", "Appendix 1, page 2\n7\nDesign Summary Performance Monitoring Assumptions\nTargets Mechanisms and Risks\nThree workshop reports and Reports \u2022  Workshop not\nbudgets meeting intended\nobjectives\nTheme papers, strategies Developments of theme Production of \u2022  Delays in identifying\nand checklists papers, strategies, and effective theme appropriate\nchecklists that will be papers, strategies, consultants\nrelevant and effective and checklists \u2022  Delays in production\ninformation resources, as of papers\nwell as an effective and \u2022  Development of\nappropriate foundation on ineffective or\nwhich to base consultation inappropriate theme\nefforts. papers\nActivities\nProduction of theme papers: \u2022  Recruit a consultant in \u2022  Identification and \u2022  Delay in identification\n\u2022  Prepare inception accordance with ADB timely or recruitment of\nreport. requirements. recruitment of consultants\n\u2022  Prepare interim report. consultants in \u2022  Delay in develop-\n\u2022  Prepare country report. accordance with ment of the desired\n\u2022  Prepare summary ADB papers\nsynthesis report. requirements \u2022  Development of\n\u2022  Production of the papers of inadequate\ndesired theme quality\npapers\nConduct workshops.
