INTRODUCTION\n1. The Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG) has requested support from the Asian\nDevelopment  Bank'  (ADB)  for  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  preparing  a  community  water-\ntransport project.1\n2. Fact-finding  for  the  TA  was  conducted  during  ADB's  Appraisal  Mission  for  the\nRehabilitation  of  the  Maritime  Navigation  Aids  in  June  2000.  The  Mission  reached  an\nunderstanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan,\nimplementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the proposed consulting services. The\nTA is included in the 2000 PNG Country Assistance Plan. This report was based on the Mission's\nobservations in the field and discussions with the Government.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. PNG is ADB's largest Pacific developing member country, with a landmass of 480,000\nsquare kilometers (km2) and sea area of 3.1 million km2. PNG has over 17,000 km of coastline and\n17 million hectares of reef-covered coastal waters, making it the largest fishing zone in the Pacific.\nIn 1990, 12 percent of the population of 4.2 million inhabited the island provinces and 44 percent\nthe coastal provinces.2\n4. The transport system of PNG is multimodal. There are 22 public ports, with numerous\nwharves, jetties, and landings, many of which are privately operated; about 20,000 km of roads;\n46 airports; and hundreds of airstrips. Land transport is constrained by the mountainous terrain\nin the north and east of the country, which divides the country. Extensive coastal swamps\ndominate the southwest, with the great delta plain of Daru forming one of the most extensive\nswamps in the world. The PNG islands consist of volcanic mountains and low coral atolls. Of the\n20 provinces, 13 are coastal: National Capital District (NDC) and Bougainville, Central, Milne\nBay, Western, Morobe, East Sepik, West Sepik (Sandaun), Manus, New Ireland, West New\nBritain, and East New Britain. The Fly and Sepik rivers are among the many large rivers. The\nFly River is navigable up to 3 meters (m) draft for 840 km and moves supplies to the mines and\ncommunities upstream and copper concentrate downstream. The Sepik offers considerable\ntourism potential and is navigable at 3 m draft for 500 km.\n5. Coastal populations have poor access to roads, and communities are often far from\nairstrips. Due to the difficult geography, shipping thrives and water transport is the primary mode\nof cargo and passenger transport. Numerous vessels operate on the coastal, interisland, and\ninland river routes. PNG shipping can be categorized as (i) international through traffic, (ii)\ncoastal traffic between the major ports, and (iii) small vessel traffic serving numerous minor\nports. The main ports of Lae, Port Moresby, and Madang handle most of the foreign trade.\nOther important ports are Alotau, Daru, Kavieng, Kimbe, and Rabaul. Many villages on the\nshores of the two major rivers are remote and do not benefit from the Government's social\nservices, and commercial and employment opportunities, and face very high prices for goods\nshipped and transshipped on multiple occasions.\n6. A large number of private and commercial voyages and travel occur by small craft.\nThese  facilitate  transport  of  produce  between  the  commercial  wharves  and  the  remote\ncommunities. In the absence of landing facilities, larger vessels typically off-load cargo over the\n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in July 2000.\n2 A population census is currently being conducted and is expected to yield data in early 2001.", "2\nside of the vessel to small craft in difficult maritime weather conditions. Vessels operating in\nhazardous maritime conditions frequently damage goods and inquire persons. The operating\ncosts of these vessels are far from efficient and the safety of such transshipment low.\n7. Commercial passenger ferry services are provided by two companies operating in the\nislands and along the north coast and which serve the main routes. Remote communities make\nlengthy  and  risky  water-route  travel  that  suffers  from  limited  or  non-existent  landing  sites,\nnavigation infrastructure, and shipping services. Low-traffic-volumes routes are serviced only on\nad hoc basis under substandard safety conditions. Access to these remote communities is\nextremely difficult and ferry services are available only along the main maritime routes, in\ndaylight hours, and during good weather. Subsequently, conditions in the coastal areas are\ncharacterized  by  high  prices,  poor  communications,  poor  social  indicators,  and,  more\nspecifically, extreme and unsafe seafaring practices.\n8. Poverty incidence in the coastal areas of PNG exceeds that of the nation. The World\nBank has defined the poverty line for PNG as an amount of income per person that is sufficient\nto meet a food-energy requirement of 2,200 calories per adult equivalent per day, plus an\nallowance for nonfood expenditure \u201cbased on the spending patterns of households whose food\nexpenditure just reach the food poverty line.\u201d Under this criterion, and based on the 1996\nnational household income and expenditure survey, it is estimated that 37.5 percent of PNG\u2019s\npopulation fall bellow the poverty line nationally. Based on estimated populations of the coastal\nprovinces in 2000, the poor under the World Bank criterion comprise 40.2 percent in the coastal\nprovinces: 33.2 percent in the Papuan south coastal areas, 45.8 percent in the Momase north\ncoastal  area,  and  33.6  percent  in  the  islands.  While  poverty  conditions  of  the  population\ninhabiting riversides are not available, it is estimated that the poor comprise 844,429 or 46\npercent of the coastal population.\n9. About 55 percent of the coastal populations draw their primary income from fishing. Half\nof the coastal residents live more than 5 km away from markets to buy and sell fish and\nproduce, and 32 percent live more than 10 km away. While 33 percent of the residents walk\nthese distances, about a third use maritime transport. For many coastal communities without\nroads, maritime transport and bush tracks (for walking) are the only means of transport.\n10. Thus, a large portion of passenger traffic is carried by small craft less than 10 m long\n(e.g., 42 percent in Milne Bay and 70 percent in Madang Province). Unsafe boating practices\nare common. Accidents are often unrecorded and figures are unavailable, but small craft are\nfrequently lost at sea with accidents and deaths unacceptably common. The importance of\nsaving lives and property at sea is reflected in the international conventions that govern public\nmaritime services provision, e.g., regulations under Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and Search\nand Rescue (SAR) Convention of 1979 under the International Maritime Organization (IMO).\nShore-based SAR arrangements must include highly efficient coordination facilities, full-time\nmonitoring services of radio distress frequencies, and the means to offer help at short notice\nand at high speed. The services need to include constant radio monitoring, operation of high-\nspeed rescue craft, and firefighting equipment, but may extend to rescue helicopters, and\nmedical  and  similar  services.  SAR  services  need  to  be  integrated  with  shipborne  SOLAS\nequipment. IMO introduced the global maritime distress and safety system (GMDSS) in 1997.\n11. In PNG, SAR operations are governed under a National Disaster Plan. Responsibility for\nmaritime SAR operations is divided among a number of agencies, including the Department of\nTransport  and  Civil  Aviation  (DOTCA),  Defense  Forces,  Department  of  Health,  shipping\ncompanies,  the  royal  Papua  Yacht  Club,  Red  Cross,  hospitals,  and  the  Post  and", "3\nTelecommunications Corporation. DOTCA is the operational center coordinating resources from\nthose agencies. This operation, however, suffers from highly constrained resources, including\nfunding. The accident record is made worse by the limited communication to vessel operators\non weather and navigation warnings. Small craft operators do not register departures and\nestimated arrival times and do not possess adequate skills for calculating fuel consumption in\nuncertain  weather  conditions.  DOTCA\u2019s  Maritime  Rescue  Coordination  Center  engages\ncurrently half a person full-time. Navigational support communications such as a ship reporting\nsystem,  navigation  warnings,  weather  forecasts  and  warnings,  radio  racons,  and  harbor\ncommunications  should  also  contribute  to  the  safety  of  ships  and  boats  at  sea.  Rescue\noperations  have  frequently  been  inconclusive.  The  Government  intends  to  implement  the\nGMDSS  recommended  by  IMO.  This  requires  analysis  of  the  required  land-based\ncommunications equipment and other resources and the institutional arrangements and policy\nframework surrounding SAR.\n12. The potential for loss of life at sea could be greatly reduced if all motorized small craft\nwere  registered,  compulsory  safety  equipment  and  seaworthiness  (e.g.  buoyancy)  were\nrequired on small craft, and reporting requirements and safety procedures as well as preferred\nroutes were made mandatory. Provincial administrative units are instrumental in implementing\npreventive safety measures, such as preparing bills to register small craft, monitoring safe\npractices in the use of small craft, and ensuring participation of small craft operators in political\ndecision making. The Government is also committed to an awareness and safety education\ncampaign to educate small boat users on safety.\n13. The Government has a plan to establish an inland waterways transport system. The aim\nis to identify cost-effective means of improving small boat services and infrastructure, inland\nnavigational aids, hydrographic surveys, and key infrastructure to encourage economic growth\nthrough safe and efficient inland waterways transport. The feasibility study will include a review\nof the required infrastructure, shipping and boating services, safety practices, legislation, and\ninstitutional and policy frameworks governing the subsector. Associated microscale and poverty-\nreducing  programs  will  be  reviewed  to  identify  possible  transport-related  bottlenecks  in\nimproving standards of living.\n14. The Government has recognized the need to fully analyze the sector to understand the\nfundamental constraints to establishing remote waterway and maritime transport markets. The\nTA supports the Government\u2019s effort to improve delivery of essential services and food to the\nmaritime communities, reduce poverty, and enhance employment and marketing possibilities\namong the currently remote and often isolated communities. With the support of the TA, the\nGovernment aims to establish acceptable seafaring logistics (e.g., landing sites, safeheavens,\nnavigation aids, and jetties) with adequate safety prevention programs and facilities to induce\ndevelopment of the remote areas.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objectives\n15. The project preparatory TA seeks to improve the low-traffic maritime transport conditions\nand  safety,  and  give  remote  maritime  communities  access  to  employment  and  marketing\nopportunities in the mainstream markets of PNG.  The TA will prepare an investment program\nfor installation of minor port and maritime safety infrastructure to facilitate safer and more\neconomical remote water-route transport and identify a policy and institutional framework to", "4\nensure  sustainability  of  the  priority  investments.  The  TA  will  target  poverty  reduction  and\nmaximum involvement of the private sector. A framework for the TA is in Appendix 1.\nB. Scope\n16. The TA includes preparation of a feasibility study examining (i) small infrastructure\nrequired to facilitate maritime and river transport, (ii) technical, institutional, and policy solutions\nfor improving the safety of small craft operations; and (iii) future shipping services along low-\ntraffic maritime and river transport routes. The feasibility study will assess poverty reduction and\neconomic, technical, institutional, social, environmental, and policy improvements in accordance\nwith relevant ADB guidelines. It will identify a sustainable and effective delivery mechanism for\nmaintaining the proposed facilities and programs, and organizational, institutional, and human\nresource improvements, and cost recovery systems that will enable effective and consistent\noperation and maintenance of the required facilities.\n17. Specifically,  the  TA  will  (i)  identify  the  demand  for  and  beneficiaries  of  improved\ntransport systems in remote maritime and river routes; (ii) prepare a prioritized program of\nremote water-way facilities, services, programs as a feasible investment program for external\nfunding; (iii) establish the economic viability of the proposed programs in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on Economic Analysis of Projects; (iv) prepare annual and regular maintenance\nprograms  for  the  proposed  systems  over  a  10-year  period;  (v)  prepare  a  sustainable\nmanagement mechanism for delivering the proposed services and facilities; (vi) prepare project\nimplementation and collaborative interagency arrangements; and (vii) determine beneficiaries'\nwillingness to pay and establish a cost recovery policy for provision of the proposed services.\nThe TA will conduct a series of workshops, seminars, and consultations with inhabitants of the\nremote  villages  and  the  ensuing  project  stakeholders  to  identify  the  demand  for  transport\nservices,  the  role  transport  services  potentially  play  in  poverty  reduction,  and  small-scale\npoverty reduction projects constrained in the past by lack of transport services.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n18. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $823,600 equivalent, of which the foreign\nexchange component is $487,600 and the local currency component is $336,000 equivalent.\nThe Government has requested ADB to finance $580,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign\nexchange cost and $92,400 equivalent of the local currency costs. The Government will finance\nthe balance of the local currency cost. The Government has been advised that approval of this\nTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The TA  will be financed by ADB on a\ngrant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. Detailed cost\nestimates are in Appendix 2.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n19. The TA will be carried out by a firm of international consultants to be engaged in\naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The TA will require about 16\nperson-months of international consulting services in the fields of civil engineering for small\nmaritime structures (small ports, jetties, ramps, and landing sites) and aids to navigation, low\ntraffic  shipping  services,  small  craft  safety  policies,  SAR  policy  and  execution,  radio  and\ntelecommunications, management of low-traffic port facilities, management of maritime and river\nroutes, poverty analysis, microscale project development, organizational and maritime transport\npolicy analysis, management, and low-traffic maritime transport policy analysis, economic and\nfinancial analyses, social and environmental analyses, human resources management, and a", "5\nprofound knowledge of the legal and administrative framework of PNG. The detailed terms of\nreference for consulting services are in Appendix 3.\n20. DOTCA  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  with  the  affected  provincial\nadministrations as Implementing Agencies. DOTCA will coordinate closely with the Department\nof National Planning and Monitoring to ensure effective liaison, data gathering, and discussion\nduring implementation. The Small Boat Advisory Committee will be the steering committee for\nthe TA. DOTCA will appoint a qualified project manager to work with the consultants and to\nprovide  coordination  between  the  Government,  its  agencies,  the  provincial  administrations,\ncommunities, users, and the consultants.\n21. The TA will be carried out over six months commencing in February 2001 and ending in\nJuly 2001. The consultants will submit an inception report, a draft final report, and a final report.\nThe consultants will organize a minimum of two tripartite meetings including the Government,\nthe consultant, and ADB to consider the reports. The consultants will also convene coordination\nmeetings among external funding agencies and the TA in connection with the scheduled two\ntripartite meetings.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n22. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of Papua New Guinea in\nan  amount  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $580,000  for  the  purpose  of  preparing  the\nCommunity Water-Transport Project, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Performance Targets Monitoring Mechanism Assumptions/Risks\nA.
