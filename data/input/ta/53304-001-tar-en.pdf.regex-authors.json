INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) developing member countries (DMCs) achieve universal health coverage (UHC) by \nsupporting the development and adoption of digital national health insurance (NHI) information \nsystems.1 \n \n2.  The TA will support the implementation of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, particularly operational \npriority 1 (addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities) and its focus area of enhancing \nhuman capital and social protection for all.2 The TA is included in the 2020 management-approved \nresults-based workplan of the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Driven by the need to support economic and human capital development, countries across \nAsia and the Pacific are strengthening national UHC strategies. Achieving UHC means that all \npeople, particularly vulnerable populations such as the poor, the elderly, people with disability, \nwomen, and children, can access quality health services without incurring financial hardship, \nresulting  in  healthier  populations.  However,  many  DMCs  face  major  challenges  in  making \nprogress toward UHC. \n \n4.  Gaps in health service coverage and financial protection. Life expectancy at birth \nincreased dramatically in Asia and the Pacific from 51 years in 1966 to over 71 years in 2014.4 \nDespite this improvement, there are major gaps in both coverage of services and financial \nprotection. Large segments of the population across the region still lack health coverage and \nconsequently pay high out-of-pocket payments. To address these gaps, DMCs are implementing \nnational UHC strategies to increase access to quality health services without incurring financial \nhardship. \n \n5.  In  several  DMCs,  a  critical  aspect  of  their  UHC  strategies  is  the  adoption  and \nimplementation of NHI. DMCs that are planning to implement or are implementing NHI schemes \ninclude Armenia, Azerbaijan, India, Indonesia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Mongolia, \nNepal, the Philippines, Tajikistan, and Viet Nam. DMCs require guidance to implement NHI, \nincluding support on how to incorporate lessons from other settings, such as ensuring quality of \ncare, expanding access, and reducing costs. \n \n6.  Inadequate tools and systems to track, analyze, and monitor drug utilization, health \nservices, and resource allocation. Collection and analysis of health information from various \ncomponents of the health system is a major challenge in the implementation of NHI in DMCs. \nGiven the need to capture and process large amounts of data, implementing NHI also requires \nthe appropriate use of digital health tools and systems. Digital health tools include health \ninformation standards and interoperability systems, electronic claims submission and processing \nsystems, pre-authorization systems, membership and health care provider management systems, \n \n1  NHI refers to a government-administered single-payer health insurance system usually financed by a combination of \nmembers\u2019 premiums and government subsidies, providing financial protection for the entire population. \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. ADB. 2019. Operational Priority 1: Addressing Remaining Poverty and Reducing Inequalities. Manila. \nSecondary operational priority alignments of the TA include operational priority 2: Accelerating progress in gender \nequality, and operational priority 6: Strengthening governance and institutional capacity.  \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 February 2020. \n4  ADB. Life Expectancy at Birth (Number of Years) in Asia and the Pacific (accessed 24 February 2020). \n ", "2 \ndigital clinical and health data analysis and reporting systems, digital drug utilization review and \nhealth services quality control systems, data capture by smartphones, cloud computing, artificial \nintelligence, and cybersecurity. These tools and systems give NHI organizations and health \nworkers timely access to accurate medical records, including hospital records that can indicate \nthe extent of compliance with clinical protocols and evidence-based guidelines, and pharmacy \nrecords to determine drug dispensing and utilization trends. They also facilitate accurate and \nreliable health monitoring, which is essential for designing and implementing interventions to raise \nthe quality of health care services and improve health outcomes.5 \n \n7.  Well-functioning NHI information systems will allow DMCs to correctly assess the health \ncare needs that fit their respective social, economic, cultural, political, and epidemiological \ncontexts. Geographical inequalities in health can also be effectively identified by capturing \naccurate information about utilization of health care services that are sufficiently granular to \ndetermine  disparities  among  marginalized  or  remote  populations  through  NHI  information \nsystems.  The  improved  routine  collection  and  analysis  of  health  information  from  various \ncomponents of the health system (e.g., drug prescriptions, diagnostics, and purchase histories of \nmedical supplies) will allow the efficient planning of future health expenditures, resource allocation, \nand financing required to expand access to needed health services for the poor, and to achieve \nand sustain UHC. \n \n8.  The TA will be implemented in five DMCs: Armenia, Bangladesh, Mongolia, the Philippines, \nand Viet Nam. ADB has conducted two TA projects in Mongolia and Viet Nam to strengthen their \nrespective NHI systems, which included technical support to improve their capacity to better \ndetermine costs of services, strengthen provider payment systems, and promote standardized \ncare  in  hospitals  for  cost  control  and  increased  quality  of  services.6  ADB  has  also  been \nimplementing a regional TA project to analyze knowledge gaps, policy barriers, and challenges in \ndeveloping and implementing NHI.7 In addition, ADB\u2019s Standards and Interoperability Lab - Asia \n(SIL-Asia) is helping DMCs ensure common standards and the interoperability of various health \ninformation systems within their countries. Although ADB has not yet conducted any TA activities \non NHI in Armenia, Bangladesh, and the Philippines, these countries have requested technical \nsupport from ADB in the adoption of digital health tools to improve the management of their NHI \nschemes and to plan projects that include health insurance components. \n \n9.  The TA incorporates lessons from previous TA projects (footnotes 6 and 7). A major lesson \nis that health insurance performance can be substantially improved if the use of digital health tools \nand systems are in place. Thus, the TA will support the development and uptake of digital health \ntools and systems that would improve the management of the NHI of two DMCs selected from \nthe five DMCs that will be assessed by this TA. Similarly, some of the work of the TA could \npotentially benefit future TA projects that assist DMCs that do not have NHI (but that do have \nother health purchasing schemes) to improve their health purchasing information systems. \n \n \n5  A.

Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: access to quality health services in selected \nDMCs improved (footnote 2). The TA will have the following outcome: management of NHI in \nselected DMCs improved.8 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: National health insurance information systems of selected developing \nmember countries assessed. The TA will conduct a region-wide landscape analysis and five \ncountry-specific assessments to review the current policies, strategies, utilization status, and \nlessons in using digital technology to improve the management of NHI of five DMCs: Armenia, \nBangladesh, Mongolia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. The landscape analysis will also draw on \nthe  lessons  from  (i)  the  open  source  health  insurance  management  information  systems \npreviously developed and endorsed by development partners such as German development \ncooperation through Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit and the Asia \neHealth Information Network and (ii) information systems of advanced countries in Asia and the \nPacific, including the Republic of Korea, to inform future development of NHI information systems \nin DMCs. \n \n12.  Output 2: National health insurance information systems of selected developing \nmember countries improved. The TA will support two DMCs to improve NHI information \nsystems as identified in the review conducted under output 1. The DMCs will be selected based \non factors that will be assessed in the review such as country buy-in, demonstrated commitment, \nexisting  policies  and  strategies,  and  readiness  for  change.  Specific  components  of  NHI \ninformation systems that DMCs may improve include (i) a basic digital NHI management system \nto support the collection and analysis of all health insurance-related data, including claims \nprocessing, member management, health care provider management, and pre-authorizations. \nThe digital NHI management system will also help the NHI improve the determination of poor and \nvulnerable  people  and households  and  the  health  insurance coverage  of these  vulnerable \npopulation; (ii) digital clinical and health data analysis and reporting systems to support the \nproduction of reports and statistical analyses to inform the allocation of resources; and (iii) a digital \ndrug utilization review and health services quality control system to support data collection and \nreporting to help NHI organizations regulate the distribution, safety, and quality of all drugs and \nhealth services.  \n \n13.  The improvement of NHI information systems will be informed by lessons from output 1 \nand build on global experiences on open source health information systems, such as openIMIS9 \nand District Health Information Software 210 and ADB\u2019s support for systems interoperability \nthrough SIL-Asia, and the use of open source applications and cloud computing and databases. \n \n8  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n9  openIMIS is an open source system linking patient, health care provider, and health payer data. Anyone can copy, \nmodify, and distribute the source code, which is managed and continuously improved by the open source software \ncommunity; the effort is led by Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit, the German Federal \nMinistry for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation. \n10  District Health Information Software 2 is a free and open source health management data platform developed by the \nUniversity of Oslo\u2019s Health Information Systems Program and supported by the university\u2019s Department of \nInformatics; it is used in more than 60 countries globally. \n ", "4 \nThe SIL-Asia team is expected to support the NHI information system design team to help support \ninteroperability. \n \n14.  Output  3:  Capacity  to  implement  and  maintain  the  national  health  insurance \ninformation systems for universal health coverage strengthened. The TA will increase the \nquantity and skill level of appropriate human resources to operate and maintain these NHI \ninformation systems through (i) two case studies on the change and the improvement of NHI \ninformation systems of two selected DMCs, (ii) policy advice and technical analysis, (iii) the \ndelivery of at least two trainings on mainstreaming digital health tools, (iv) a one-on-one hands-\non training program, and (v) an ADB knowledge product on the use of digital technology to \nimprove NHI in Asia and the Pacific. To promote the sharing of knowledge generated from the \nTA, ADB will hold a seminar to introduce the knowledge product and key lessons from the TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nRepublic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB. The key \neligible expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will administer the TA and will be the executing agency. The Health Sector Group \nSecretariat (HSGS) of ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department will \nimplement the TA and be accountable for the outputs. The HSGS will carry out TA administration, \nsupervision, implementation oversight, and communication with consultants and stakeholders. \nThe HSGS will also coordinate with operations departments, resident missions, the Digital \nTechnology for Development Unit, and the Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership. \n \n17.
