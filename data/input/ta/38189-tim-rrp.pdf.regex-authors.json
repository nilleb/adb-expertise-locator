An initial environmental examination was undertaken; \nAssessment  the summary is provided in Appendix 14. \nProject Description  The  Project  will  (i)  check,  and  refurbish,  replace  and  install  (as \nrequired) up to 35 primary and secondary distribution master meters; \n(ii)  check and replace, as necessary, up to 51 kilometers of tertiary \ndistribution  (reticulation)  water  pipes;  (iii)  check  and  replace,  as \nnecessary, up to 2,950 household meters and 240 commercial and \nbulk meters; (iv) check and normalize, as necessary, up to 5,100 \nhousehold connections and up to 170 commercial connections; (v) \nrelocate up to 1,700 existing water service connections to allow the \ndisconnection of up to 7,000 linear meters of old asbestos cement \nand other water mains; (vi) install up to 88 new stop valves; (vii) \nrefurbish or replace nine chlorination dosing units at deep bores; (viii) \nundertake practical minor repairs to support operational efficiency \nand safety; (ix) train and support a Dili water demand management \ntask force; (x) establish and give in-field mentoring for three leak \ndetection teams; and (xi) train six subzone caretakers. The Project is \nbeing proposed under a sector modality. \nRationale  Timor-Leste is one of the least developed countries in the world. Per \ncapita gross domestic product (non-oil) was estimated at $370 in \n2006 and has fallen in most years since 2001. Timor-Leste\u2019s human \ndevelopment  index  remains  the  lowest  amongst  Southeast  Asian \ncountries. The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target for water \nsupply in Timor-Leste is to increase the proportion of people with \nimproved access to water from 44% to 78%. Coverage of 24-hour \nsafe water supply in Dili city remains low at 25\u201330%. About 50% of \nthe water that is produced and distributed to Dili is lost through leaks \nand pilferage. Nonrevenue water is about 85%. The Government\u2019s \ndraft water supply and sanitation sector investment plan for 2008\u2013\n2012, will guide national budget decisions.  Dili is a priority district in \nthe investment plan. The Dili water supply system has good water \nproduction and good main distribution infrastructure. With reasonable \ninvestments in tertiary distribution and more attention to customer \nservice,  the  system  could  achieve  technical  and  financial  self-\nsustainability. The proposed sector Project is the first step. ", " \n  The proposed Project will use a zonal approach to totally rehabilitate \nthe  tertiary  network  and  connections  in  six  subzones,  each  with \n1,000 connections. The Government will use its own finances to \nimplement the zonal approach in the remainder of the Dili service \narea, and then the second city, Baucau, followed by other district \ntowns.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Dili  Water  Supply \nPerformance  Improvement  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  build \ncapacity in the National Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation \n(DNSAS)  for  demand  management;  unaccounted-for-water \nreduction; and better business planning, management and reporting. \nAnother  ADB  TA,  Infrastructure  Project  Management,  will  build \nproject  management  capacity  in  DNSAS,  including  for  managing \nenvironmental and social risks.  \n \nADB\u2019s country program and strategy update for 2006\u20132008 identifies \ninfrastructure development and management as the primary focus of \nADB support to Timor-Leste. As a post-conflict country, Timor-Leste \nis eligible for grant financing from the Asian Development Fund. \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  is  expected  to  improve  water  supply  services  for \nhouseholds, businesses and institutions in Dili city. The expected \noutcome is improved hydraulic management of the Dili water supply \nsystem and more efficient tertiary distribution. \n \nProject Investment  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $7.5  million,  including \nPlan   contingencies, taxes and duties.  \nFinancing Plan  Source  Total ($ million)  Percent \nAsian Development Bank  6.0       80 \nGovernment  1.5       20 \n Total  7.5      100 \nGrant Amount   A grant of $6,000,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will be \nprovided  to  finance  the  80%  of  the  total  project  cost.  The \nGovernment will provide the remaining $1,500,000 (20%).  \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 May 2011. \nEstimated Project  30 November 2010. \nCompletion Date \nImplementation  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  29  months.  The \nArrangements  preconstruction  activities\u2014detailed  design,  preparation  of  bidding \ndocuments,  tendering,  and  award  of  contracts\u2014will  start  in  July \n2008. Commencement of civil works is targeted for January 2009, \nand completion in November 2010. \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Infrastructure. \n   \n ", "  iii\nProcurement  All  procurement  under  the  Project,  including  both  ADB  and \nGovernment-financed  packages,  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Civil works will be \ndivided into three packages\u2014one to be procured using international \ncompetitive  bidding  and  two  using  national  competitive  bidding. \nSupply of goods contracts will be divided into four contracts\u2014three \nusing  international  competitive  bidding  and  one  using  national \ncompetitive bidding. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting services are provided in two packages. The package for \nproject implementation support will engage international and national \nconsultants for (i) project management; (ii) in-field mentoring of leak \ndetection  teams  and  subzone  caretakers;  (iii)  socioeconomic \nmonitoring and evaluation; and (iv) project financial management, \nreporting,  and  auditing.  The  second  package  will  engage \ninternational  and  national  consultants  to  prepare  detailed \nengineering design and documentation, and construction supervision \nservices.  The  Project  will  fund  a  total  of  36  person-months  of \ninternational and 68 person-months of domestic consulting services. \nConsulting  firms  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time).  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will reduce the cost of water supplies for low-income \nBeneficiaries  families  who  otherwise  spend  time  collecting  water  from  other \nsources and spend money reducing the contamination of drinking \nand  cooking  water.  More  reliable,  safe  water  supplies  will  also \nreduce health costs and improve productivity of beneficiary families.  \nImproved  water  supplies  to  businesses  will  make  them  more \ncompetitive and increase job opportunities for local residents. About \n6,000 families (60% being low-income families) and 400 businesses \nwill directly benefit in the six targeted subzones. And all other Dili \nconsumers will benefit from system-wide operating improvements. \nProject  implementation  will  create  about  450  labor-years  of \nemployment.  \n   \nRisks and  The project design considers potential risks associated with project \nAssumptions  management, construction quality, and utilization of improved water \nsupplies. A team of international and national consultants will help \nDNSAS  with  project  management  and  will  help  the  Corporate \nServices  Directorate  of  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  with \nprocurement  and  project  financial  management.  Environmental \nimpact  will  be  monitored  through  construction  supervision  and \nmitigated  in  accordance  with  the  approved  environmental \nmanagement monitoring plan. Project consultants will work alongside \nDNSAS contracted and regular staff in the field to ensure DNSAS \nhas adequate leak detection skills and subzone caretaker skills to \nexpand and sustain its water loss reduction program in other zones. \nThe Dili Water Supply Performance Improvement TA will also build \nDNSAS  capacity  to  sustainably  operate  and  maintain  the  water \nsupply assets upgraded by the sector Project.   \n ", " \nM\nA\nP\n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the Dili Urban Water Supply Sector Project (the \nProject). The design and monitoring framework is attached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Timor-Leste regained its independence in May 2002 after 24 years as a province of \nIndonesia. Before the Indonesian administration, Timor-Leste was a colony of Portugal for almost \n400 years. Infrastructure investment was scant during the Portuguese era. Likewise, water supply \nand sanitation services were limited, serving only certain parts of a few urban centers, including \nthe capital, Dili.  Under Indonesian administration from 1975 to 1999, East Timor benefited from \nlarge centrally financed infrastructure investments, including rural and urban water supply and \nsanitation (WSS). A semi-autonomous local government water enterprise managed the Dili public \npiped water supply system and was supported by central budget subsidies through to 1999. \nNevertheless, by 1998, only 41% of Dili residents had access to piped water of varying quality \nand reliability, and 44% still used shallow or deep wells.  \n \n3.  The Dili water enterprise and most district WSS facilities were badly damaged during the \nIndonesian withdrawal in 1999. By the time the first Asian Development Bank (ADB) Water \nSupply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project1 was approved in July 2000, emergency repairs had \nenabled parts of the Dili water supply system to be recommissioned. A second phase Water \nSupply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project2 was approved in July 2001. The total budget of both \nphases was $9.0 million, spread across all 13 districts. In addition to physical rehabilitation of \nwater supplies, the WSS Rehabilitation projects rehabilitated, restored, reequipped, and trained \nstaff of the newly constituted United Nations-administered Office of Water and Sanitation, which \nlater became the Government of Timor-Leste\u2019s Water and Sanitation Service, and is now the \nNational  Directorate  for  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  (DNSAS).  The  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), other development \nassistance  agencies,  and  international  nongovernment  organizations,  also  invested  in  WSS \nrehabilitation in rural and urban areas. \n \n4.  Support  for  WSS  rehabilitation  in  Timor-Leste  since  2000,  including  the  two  ADB-\nimplemented WSS rehabilitation projects has generally only been partly successful.3 The main \nshortcoming\u2014as it was during the Indonesian administration\u2014has been lack of sustainability. \nCommunity-managed  systems  in  rural  areas  have  not  proven  sustainable.  And  inadequate \noperations and maintenance (O&M) funding and expertise have reduced returns on urban water \nsupply investments. The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets for access to safe water in \nTimor-Leste are to increase access in rural areas from 51% in 2001 to 75% in 2015; and from \n72% to 86% in urban areas. But many rural water supply systems have failed and urban water \nsupplies are typically intermittent and of varying quality. DNSAS estimates that in 2007, access to \nclean water supply is approximately 43% nationally, 45% in urban and peri-urban areas, and 41% \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000.

", "2   \nin rural areas. Although the statistical disparities partly result from definitional inconsistencies, the \nMDG baseline estimates are likely too high.    \n \n5.  Since 2000, about $30 million has been invested in Dili for water production, primary and \nsecondary  distribution,  and  connections;  $5  million  has  been  spent  on  establishing  and \nstrengthening DNSAS. Despite this, less than 30% of Dili households enjoy a 24-hour safe water \nsupply, compared with the Government\u2019s National Development Plan (NDP) target of 80% of the \nurban population with access to a safe piped water supply by 2020.4 More than 50% of the Dili \nwater supply system experiences high leakage, low or variable pressure, and intermittent supply \nwith water available for between 3 and 16 hours per day. Complaints of no water and low \npressure  make  up  one  third  of  consumer  complaints.  Water  sources,  treatment  plants,  and \ntransmission mains have sufficient capacity to meet Dili city\u2019s water needs for several years. The \nprimary and secondary distribution system is now in generally good condition. The poor service is \nlargely caused by (i) lack of tertiary pipes (reticulation), (ii) poor condition of tertiary pipes and \nservice connections, and (iii) inadequate demand management. In August 2007, with no water \nbills being issued by DNSAS and no payments made by consumers, nonrevenue water (NRW)5 \nwas technically 100%. However, an estimated total of 15% of all water supplied to the Dili city \nwater supply was reticulated through consumers\u2019 meters, and if this water had been billed and \npaid for, NRW would stand at 85%. Meanwhile, unaccounted for water6 is estimated at 70% in \nFY2007. By comparison, average NRW for urban water supplies in Southeast Asian countries is \n29%. This is discussed in the Dili City Water Supply Study (Supplementary Appendix A).  \n \n6.  Improving water supplies in Dili is now an urgent priority: (i) Dili\u2019s water supply operations \nare Timor-Leste\u2019s biggest drain on WSS sector financial, technical and management resources, \nand divert resources away from small towns and rural areas; (ii) returns on investments by JICA \nand others are low but could be greatly increased by relatively modest investments in Dili\u2019s \ntertiary network; (iii) Dili has the most potential in Timor-Leste to be a successful and self-\nsustaining water supply operation; (iv) rural\u2013urban migration in Timor-Leste is rapid and Dili is \ngrowing fast; and (iv) donor attention is almost entirely on rural, not urban WSS.    \n \n7.  The sector Project will complete the vertical integrity of Dili\u2019s water supply system in \nselected zones, and improve system management and customer relations in order to achieve \nefficient delivery to regularized customers, including low-income households.  \n   \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n8.  As  a  recently  independent,  post-conflict  county,  Timor-Leste  faces  uncommon \ndevelopment challenges. The first constitutional Government after independence adopted the \nNDP 2002\u20132020, which incorporates a national poverty reduction strategy. The new Government \nis preparing a 5-year NDP for 2008\u20132012. The previous system of annually updated 5-year rolling \nsector investment plans, and annual action plans is under review. The planning is sound, but the \ndifficulty is translating these plans and programs into tangible benefits for ordinary citizens. For \nthe  WSS  sector,  and  specifically  for  urban  water  supply,  achieving  tangible,  sustainable \ndevelopment results is constrained by (i) inadequate capital investment; (ii) inadequate O&M \nfunding; (iii) limited human resources to plan, implement and manage water supplies; and (iv) \ndifficult customer relations. Finally, the 2006 political crisis and civil unrest severely damaged the \nGovernment\u2019s ability to deliver public services, particularly in Dili and specifically water supplies.  \n \n                                                 \n4  Planning Commission of East Timor. 2002. East Timor National Development Plan. Dili. \n5  Nonrevenue water is measured as the difference between water supplied and water sold (i.e., billed irrespective of \nwhether it is paid for or not) expressed as a percentage of water supplied by the water production facilities. \n6  Unaccounted-for water is water that is lost to the system through leaks and pilferage. \n ", "  3\n  1.  Problems \n9.  Inadequate Capital Investment. Approximately $55 million was spent on urban water \nsupply investments from 2000 to 2007, mostly funded by donors, notably contributors to the Trust \nFund for East Timor, and JICA, German Technical Cooperation, Portugal Cooperation, and other \nofficial  and  nongovernment  agencies  and  organizations.  With  increasing  fiscal  strength,  the \nGovernment has started appropriating budgets for urban water supply capital works, amounting to \nabout $500,000 annually. The funding has been sufficient only to rehabilitate high priority facilities \nsuch as deep wells, water intakes, transmission mains, water treatment plants, and primary \ndistribution mains in Dili and some district centers. Funding has been inadequate to rehabilitate \nsecondary and tertiary distribution. Suboptimal investment strategies have exacerbated the lack \nof funding. First, capital works focused on upstream facilities before rehabilitating downstream \nnetworks, meaning that the additional water produced is mostly lost. Second, investments have \nbeen spread too thinly, resulting in only partial rehabilitation of many systems that still cannot \noperate effectively. These strategies have had a damaging financial impact on DNSAS, as legal \nwater sales decline while water production costs increase.     \n \n10.  Inadequate Operations and Maintenance Funding. Legal water sales cover only 5% of \nDNSAS  operating  costs,  leaving  O&M  funding  almost  completely  reliant  on  Government \nsubsidies.  In  FY2007,  $1.8  million  was  budgeted  for  urban  water  and  sanitation  recurrent \nexpenses across Dili, Baucau and 11 other district centers. About 60% is directly allocated for Dili \nwater  supply  O&M.  This  equates  to  about  $0.11  per  cubic  meter  (m3)  of  water  produced, \ncompared  with  the  Southeast  Asian  average  of  $0.19/m3.  The  net  result  is  accelerated \ndegradation  of  plant,  equipment,  pipes  and  fittings;  and  an  inexorable  decline  in  system \nfunctionality and service quality.  \n \n11.  Limited  Human  Resources.  DNSAS  has  a  staff  cap  of  174  full-time  regular  staff;  \ncurrently 155 positions are filled. It also retains 54 temporary staff. Of these, 77 permanent and \n19 temporary staff members are employed at Dili locations. Nevertheless, with a bias in favor of \nDili operations, DNSAS has a relatively high number of staff per 1,000 connections ratio of 10.5 \nfor  Dili.  But  the  measure  excludes  possibly  thousands  of  unauthorized  water  connections, \nmeaning that the actual ratio is significantly lower. The larger problem is that many staff members \nhave  limited  water  supply  experience  and  qualifications,  especially in  critical  areas  such as \nsystem hydraulic planning and management, and leak detection. DNSAS also has too few field-\nbased caretakers who can intensively monitor water supplies.  \n \n12.  Difficult Customer Relations. DNSAS receives about 180 complaints per month from Dili \ncustomers, about lack of water, no meter, broken meter, leaks, low pressure, and dirty water. \nAccountability to service users is limited: for instance, receipt of customer service requests and \ncomplaints is restricted to business hours and only available in one location. Service quality is not \nroutinely monitored, and no standards have been developed for response times. DNSAS does not \nsurvey or methodically solicit the view of its customers. Invoicing and payment arrangements \nwere  not  \u201cconsumer-friendly\u201d  when  consumers  were  being  billed  for  water  for  a  period  of \napproximately 16 months up to April 2006. DNSAS management is aware of these shortcomings \nbut lacks the resources to address them. \n \n13.  2006 National Crisis. Following the 2006 political crisis and civil disturbances, some Dili \nneighborhoods remain openly hostile to officials and outsiders, they are unwilling to cooperate on \npublic goods issues, and have reduced incomes. The disturbances affected DNSAS staff and \nmanagement  personally  degraded  overall  DNSAS  capability  and  destroyed  and  damaged \nDNSAS valves, meters, and pipes. For several months after May 2006, DNSAS in Dili operated \non an emergency footing as it struggled to keep water production and distribution from collapsing \n ", "4   \ncompletely, and meanwhile worked with aid agencies to deliver water and sanitation services to \n70,000  internally  displaced  persons  in  a  dozen  camps.  DNSAS  is  recovering  and  with  the \npresence of international forces Dili is mostly calm, but the situation is not fully normalized. \n \n14.  Implications for Economic Development and Poverty. Unreliable urban water supply is \none of several constraints slowing economic development in Dili and other urban centers. The \nconstraining effects of water supplies cannot be quantified, suffice that it is probably a lesser \nconstraint than the difficulty of doing business, legal risks, high economic costs, low skills, and \nunreliable electric power. More important is the strong link between urban water supplies and \npoverty in Timor-Leste. Approximately 75% of Dili residents live in low-income informal areas with \nthe lowest water supply service. Unreliable or nonexistent piped water supply increases their \nfinancial costs of obtaining clean water, increases morbidity and health costs, and requires time \nfor water collection and transportation.  \n \n  2.  Opportunities \n15.  National Planning Context. Timor-Leste subscribes to the MDG targets for WSS; has a \nwell-formulated NDP with an embedded national poverty reduction strategy with WSS targets; \nhas an annually updated water supply and sanitation sector program; and has WSS policies \ncovering, for instance, service requirements for different classes of customers and beneficiaries in \ndifferent geographic contexts. An NDP objective is to provide adequate, safe, and sustainable \nwater supplies for Dili communities and major urban centers in the districts, with the aim of full \ncost recovery from the users of the water supply (NDP footnotes, p. 275). The NDP 2020 target \n(recently brought forward to 2015) is for 80% of Timor-Leste\u2019s urban population to have access to \nsafe piped water (NDP page 280). The target implies 24-hour continuous service to household \nconnections. Listed NDP projects include (i) capital works, rehabilitation of Dili headworks and \ndistribution; (ii) O&M and service improvements of new connections in Dili; and (iii) resolution, \nremoval of illegal connections in Dili. The draft water supply and sanitation sector investment \nprogram 2008\u20132012 provides for accelerated WSS investments in six priority districts, including \nDili and Baucau. Appendix 2 provides an analysis of the WSS sector in Timor-Leste, detailing \nespecially the situation in Dili. \n \n16.  Lessons  Learned.  Regional  experience7 clearly  indicates that  good governance  and \nadequate operating revenues are crucial prerequisites for sustaining good urban water supplies, \nespecially for the underserved poor. This applies to DNSAS, but the way forward is complicated \nby the post-crisis social and economic situation in Dili. The ADB project performance audit report \nfor phases I and II of the Water Supply and Sanitation Project (footnote 3) notes that investments \nwere  spread  too  thinly  across  too  many  subprojects,  which  ultimately  reduced  development \nresults.  The  report  notes  the  failure  to  re-impose  charges  for  urban  water  services.  It \nrecommends that ADB support urban WSS investments rather than rural, as well as DNSAS \ncapacity building.   \n \n17.  Options and Asian Development Bank Strategy. Most donor support for WSS in Timor-\nLeste targets rural areas; soon, no major support for urban WSS will be ongoing or planned. ADB \nsupport for urban water supply is needed to help the Government achieve its NDP and MDG \ntargets; this is consistent with the PPAR recommendation.  \n \n18.  Donor support for urban water supply in Timor-Leste has been spread over too many \nsystems and across too much of each system. Only some components of each system have been \n                                                 \n7  McIntosh,  A. 2003. Asian  Water  Supplies:  Reaching  the  Urban  Poor.  Manila.  Asian  Development  Bank  and \nInternational Water Association Publishing. \n ", "  5\nimproved (typically upstream facilities) and these incomplete systems have not been able to \nsustain  improved  water  supplies  to  most  households.  Also,  DNSAS  lacks  the  resources  to \nproperly operate and maintain the Dili and 12 district urban systems. Learning from this and \nglobal experience, the preferred approach is to concentrate efforts in Dili first; and to use a zonal \napproach to solving Dili\u2019s water supply problems. While Dili is presently DNSAS\u2019s biggest drain on \nresources, it could be DNSAS\u2019s largest water sales market, able eventually to cross-subsidize \nsanitation and poorer rural water supply operations. The zonal approach concentrates efforts on \njust a few hydraulically defined zones at a time, getting them operating properly, and then moving \non to the next zone(s) to be upgraded. The process is gradually introduced through a city until the \nentire system is functioning efficiently. The zonal approach suits ADB\u2019s sector grant modality \nsince it takes a geographic slice and a time slice (2008\u20132010) of the Government\u2019s urban water \nsupply development program guided by the draft water supply and sanitation sector investment \nplan 2008\u20132012. Once demonstrated as an effective approach, it will be refined and implemented \nthroughout  the  rest  of  Dili,  in  Baucau,  and  in  other  district  centers  funded  mostly  by  the \nGovernment under an accelerated NDP.  \n \n19.  Wastewater collection and disposal is almost entirely a private responsibility in Timor-\nLeste  cities  and  towns.  No  sewerage  or  government-operated  communal  septic  tanks  are \navailable. Households and businesses provide for their own on-site treatment and disposal, with \nvarying effectiveness and adequacy; only one government-operated septage8 treatment facility \nserves Dili. DNSAS currently lacks the financial and technical capacity to develop and manage \npublic wastewater management systems. This undesirable situation will have to be addressed as \nsettlement densities increase in Dili. But for now, efforts should focus on improving hydraulic \nmanagement and reducing water losses in Dili. This involves no increase in water supplied to the \nurban area and therefore no additional wastewater. \n \n20.  Improving water supplies in Dili will need to reflect post-crisis political, technical, financial \nand social realities. A conventional strategy to mass install meters and bill and collect from all \ncustomers will not be immediately practical. While political will to immediately improve DNSAS is \nstrong, improving revenue performance requires a more gradual and selective strategy. Since \nmetering,  billing  and  collecting  are  important  demand  management  elements,  the  postcrisis \nenvironment in Dili poses special challenges for sustaining water supply improvements. A start \ncan be made with commercial and bulk customers and relatively well-off households in formal \nneighborhoods.  \n \n21.  The Government has a long-term aim to build financial and administrative autonomy in \nDNSAS, possibly as a public corporation utilizing a management contract. A technically and \nfinancially  successful  Dili  water  supply  operation  is  essential  for  achieving  this.  ADB  has \napproved a technical assistance (TA)9 to improve the performance of the Dili water supply, \ncomplementing the Project. The opportunities and recommendations for DNSAS performance \nimprovement are discussed in Appendix 3 and elaborated in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n22.  External Assistance. Since 2003, only the Government of Japan and JICA have financed \nmajor water supply investments in Dili; the Government of Portugal through Aguas de Portugal \nTimor-Leste, and the German Technical Cooperation upgraded components of the water supply \nsystem in the second city, Baucau. JICA\u2019s program in Dili is now complete, having rehabilitated all \nthe city\u2019s smaller water treatment plants and built a new central water treatment plant with a \ncapacity of 6,000 m3 per day. Distribution has been improved to all of Dili\u2019s 10 water supply \nzones,  but  there  was  only  limited  work  on  tertiary  distribution  to  consumers  within  zones. \n                                                 \n8  Septage is the sludge removed from household, commercial, and communal septic tanks. \n9  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to Timor-Leste for Dili Water Supply Performance Improvement. Manila. \n ", "6   \nAustralian  Agency  for  International  Development,  ADB,  Aguas  de  Portugal,  and  JICA  are \nproviding capacity building support for the Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI) and DNSAS (urban), \nincluding  sector  policy  development,  water  catchment  management,  water  supply  system \nmanagement, and water supply technician training. External assistance to the urban water supply \nsector in Timor-Leste is set out in Appendix 4.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n23.  The intended impact of the Project is improved water supply services for households, \nbusinesses and institutions in Dili city. The intended outcome is improved hydraulic management \nof the Dili city water supply system and more efficient tertiary distribution. The project area \ncomprises all 10 water supply zones of the Dili city water supply service area. Within the project \narea, tertiary distribution improvements will be concentrated in six subzones together comprising \napproximately 12% of the total service area, 31% of the total population of the service area, 30% \nof total connections, and 21% of the total water supplied. The six target subzones are all supplied \nby  the  primary  and  secondary  tertiary  distribution  system,  have  a  mix  of  consumer  types, \ncomprise about 60% low income households, are less affected by ongoing civil unrest, and are \ntechnically suited to improved hydraulic control and tertiary distribution.  The sector Project takes \na time slice and a geographic slice of the Government\u2019s draft 2008\u20132012 sector investment \nprogram to improve water supply services across all of Dili city and Baucau. ADB has approved \nTA projects10  which will ensure that the Government has the necessary capacity to implement \nthe sector program.   \n \nB.  Outputs \n24.  The Project\u2019s outputs in six subzones of three target water supply zones will be replicated \nprogressively across Dili\u2019s remaining seven zones, the Baucau city service area, and in other \ndistrict centers. The Project has three components: (component 1) subzone water supplies\u2014\nwater losses reduced and controlled in subzones of three target water supply zones; (component \n2) citywide water supplies\u2014visible leaks reduced and strategic improvements to the pipe network, \nand  commercial  and  bulk  customers  metered  in  all  10  zones;  and  (component  3)  capacity \nbuilding\u2014skill of DNSAS technical and O&M staff upgraded in leak detection, leak reduction, \ndistribution planning, and distribution management. Key activities include the following: \n \n(i)  Subzone water supplies. Plan, design and implement leak detection, reduction, \nand control program, together with the DNSAS demand management (NRW) task \nforce,11 and help DNSAS recruit and train three leak detection teams. Procure and \ninstall pipes, fittings, and other materials, including minor trenching; and inspect, \nrepair or replace faulty distribution valves and bulk meters. Create physical zones \nand subzones by installing valves and other works. Connect un-served households \nand businesses. Inspect, replace or install meters on all authorized connections in \ntarget zones. \n(ii)  City-wide  water  supplies.  Identify  and  repair  visible  leaks  and  open  pipe \ndischarges. Inspect, replace, or install meters on all authorized commercial and \nbulk  connections.  Repair  or  replace  unserviceable  chlorination  equipment  at \n                                                 \n10  Footnote 9 and ADB. 2007.

Relocate existing water service connections to allow the \ndisconnection of old leaking water mains. \n(iii)  Capacity  building  (in  addition  to  the  ADB  TA  4869-TIM:  Dili  Water  Supply \nPerformance Improvement TA [footnote 9]). Provide formal training and on-the-job \ntraining for leak detection teams, and ongoing support and on-the-job training in \ndistribution planning and management. \n \nC.  Asian Development Fund IX Grant Component  \n25.  The entire ADB contribution will be an Asian Development Fund IX grant. As a low- \nincome,  post-conflict  country,  Timor-Leste  is  eligible  for  Asian  Development  Fund  IX  grants \nequivalent to 40% of its overall ADF IX entitlement. The Government has no experience and \nlimited capacity to manage external debt. Because of the post-crisis situation in Dili, the Project\u2019s \nfinancial  rate  of  return  will  be  relatively  low.  Most  direct  beneficiaries  will  be  low-income \nhouseholds.  \n \n26.  The Project justifies Asian Development Fund grant assistance, even for a fiscally strong \ngovernment. First, financing the Project enables ADB to help apply, refine, and demonstrate an \napproach to improving urban water supplies, where there currently is no approach. The sector \nmodality will allow lessons learned from the three core subprojects to be designed into the three \nfollow-on  candidate  subprojects;  and  for  the  approach  to  be  replicated  using  Government \nresources  throughout  the  urban  water  supply  sector.  Second,  the  Project  is  a  vehicle  for \ndelivering on-the-job and classroom capacity building essential for permanently reducing water \nlosses.     \n \nD.  Special Features \n27.  Post Conflict Support. Preparation of the Project was suspended in mid-2006 because \nof civil unrest throughout Dili and the emergency pressures on the implementing agency, DNSAS. \nEighteen months later, the United Nations retains executive policing powers, particularly in Dili, \nand armed foreign troops provide a stabilization force. About 40,000 residents of Dili remain \ndisplaced, and some neighborhoods are hostile to outsiders and officials. The project design \nadapts to these challenges. The project scope and approach is simplified by (i) focusing on \nimproving water supplies to consumers in areas already served, albeit poorly; (ii) not attempting \nto  expand  the  Dili  service  area;  (iii)  not  introducing  new  community-based  management \narrangements or innovations, particularly for informal neighborhoods; and (iv) limiting early billing \nand collection efforts to commercial, institutional, and large customers. Since no extra water is \nprovided to the service area, no sanitation component is included. Zone selection considers \nneighborhood stability and security.     \n \n28.  Complementing JICA Investments. JICA and the Government of Japan have funded \napproximately $25 million equivalent of rehabilitation and improvements to the Dili water supply \nsystem since 2000. These investments ensure that an adequate supply of clean and reliable \nwater can now be distributed to most zones. The Project builds on this by ensuring this water is \ndelivered legally and accountably to customers in three of the zones, and thereafter to customers \nin all zones.  \n \n29.  Zonal Approach, Leak Detection Teams, and Caretakers. The zonal approach will \nmaximize development results by getting the system functioning correctly in subzones in three \ntarget water supply zones. Consumers in other zones will demand the same. The Project will \nprovide  demand  management  specialists  and  leak  detection  technicians  with  water  utility \noperations experience to train and give hands-on support to DNSAS\u2019s three leak detection teams. \n ", "8   \nThe Dili Water Supply Performance Improvement TA (footnote 9) will help DNSAS recruit and \ntrain six subzone caretakers (approximately one caretaker per 1,000 connections) who will work \nalongside project staff in the field. Each subzone caretaker will be responsible for managing \nO&M, NRW control, and customer relations in the concerned subzone. \n \n30.  Sustainability. The Project and the Dili Water Supply Performance Improvement  TA \nincorporate measures to ensure the project outcome is sustained beyond project completion: (i) \nthe  demand  management  task  force  that  the  TA  will  help  establish  within  DNSAS  will  be \nmandated to work to reduce NRW in other zones in Dili, (ii) the Project will plan and prepare work \nplans and targets for NRW reduction in the next target zones, (iii) leak detection teams will have \ntheir contracts extended or will be recruited as DNSAS staff, (iv) MOI and DNSAS will outsource \nmost NRW work, and (v) permanent subzone caretakers will continue NRW monitoring and \ncontrol in the completed sub-zones. Learning from earlier project experiences, sustainability will \nbe enhanced by appropriate targeting of project resources.    \n \n31.  Alignment with Government Procedures and Systems. The Project will not have a \nseparate project management unit. The project team leader will work within the Dili Water and \nSanitation Division, DNSAS; project team technical staff will work in the divisions and units of their \ndirect DNSAS counterparts; and procurement and financial management project staff will work in \nthe Corporate Services Directorate of MOI. This approach will ensure that skills and technology \nare passed on to DNSAS and MOI staff.    \n \n32.  Financing  Arrangements.  Use  of  the  sector  modality  will  give  DNSAS  financing \npredictability  while  ensuring  sufficient  flexibility  to  sequence  tertiary  distribution  upgrading \naccording to prevailing conditions, which can be less predictable. With project experience for \nthree  zones  in  Dili,  DNSAS  will  be  able  to  accurately  define  scope  and  estimate  costs  for \nimplementing the program through the remaining seven zones in Dili, Baucau, and elsewhere. \n \nE.  Project Investment Plan \n33.  The project investment cost is estimated at $7.5 million, including contingencies, and \ntaxes and duties of $0.275 million. The project cost estimates are summarized in Table 1 and \ndetailed in Appendix 5.   \n \nF.  Financing Plan \n34.  The  Government  has  requested  a  grant  of  $6,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources to finance 80% of the total project cost. The Government will finance the remaining \n$1,500,000 (20%).

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n35.  MOI will be the Executing Agency, responsible for overall project management. DNSAS \nwill be the Implementing Agency, responsible for day-to-day project implementation. To the extent \npossible, project management will align with existing MOI and DNSAS structures and use their \nsystems and processes. No separate and distinct project management unit will be set up. The \nproject team will be headed by a long-term international project team leader who will be located \nwithin the Dili Water and Sanitation Division, DNSAS. The project team will comprise (i) two water \nsupply  engineers  (including  the  project  team  leader)  undertaking  planning,  preparing  bid \ndocuments, and managing contracts, and who will be located in the Dili Water and Sanitation \nDivision,  DNSAS;  (ii)  two  financial  management  specialists  will  be  located  within  the  MOI \nCorporate Services Directorate; and (iii) two monitoring and evaluation specialists will be located \nwithin the Development and Planning Division of DNSAS. Project-funded procurement will be \nhandled by the Procurement Division, within MOI, with support from the project team. The project \nteam leader will be responsible for coordinating all project inputs and will oversee and contribute \nto (i) bidding processes, (ii) contract management, (iii) implementation progress monitoring, (iv) \npreparation of withdrawal applications, (v) preparation of project progress reports and project \ncompletion report, (vi) maintenance of project accounts and grant financial records for auditing, \nand (vii) monitoring of the Project\u2019s socioeconomic impacts. The project team leader will report \n ", "10  \ndirectly to DNSAS director and to the MOI director of Corporate Services. Outline terms of \nreference for consulting services are presented in Appendix 6. \n \n36.  The  ADB  Infrastructure  Project  Management  TA  (footnote  10)  will  support  project \nmanagement of the Government-funded infrastructure capital program. This capacity-building TA \nwill place project management engineers, procurement specialists, and other specialists in MOI. \nA  TA-funded  procurement  specialist  will  be  available  to  assist  the  project  team  and  the \nProcurement Division of the MOI Corporate Services Directorate undertake procurement for the \nProject.  TA-funded  safeguard  specialists  will  be  available  to  help  DNSAS  undertake \nenvironmental and social impact assessment and management for the Project.  \n \n37.  The results of the financial management assessment (FMA), which was conducted in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects (2005) during project \npreparation, are summarized in Appendix 3. The sector Project's capacity-building component is \ndesigned to address weaknesses identified by assessment. These initiatives will supplement \nsupport from the Dili Water Supply Performance Improvement TA to strengthen DNSAS corporate \ngovernance and financial management capacity. As a consequence of these initiatives and the \nseparate accounting arrangements recommended, the proposed project financial management \narrangements for the Project are considered satisfactory. \n \n2.  Subproject Preparation and Selection \n38.  Candidate Subproject Preparation. Three core subprojects have been identified, one in \neach of the three target water supply zones. Procedures for the selection of target water supply \nzones and subproject subzones are explained in Supplementary Appendix C. Both the water \nsupply zones within the Dili water supply system and the subproject subzones were selected \npartly for their hydraulic properties within the pipe network. The work within the subzones is \ndetailed in the subproject appraisal reports (Supplementary Appendix D) and involves a technical \nand customer-based approach to implementing a total management package for water supply \nwithin the subzones. Work will include (i) the installation of bulk meters to measure water supplied \nto  the  subzone;  (ii)  repair,  replacement,  or  installation  of  tertiary  water  pipes  servicing  the \nsubzone; (iii) repair, replacement, or installation of metered water service connections to all \nconsumers with immediate access to tertiary mains; (iv) refurbishment or installation of communal \nwater facilities to serve consumers without immediate access to tertiary water mains; and (v) \nsignificant customer and consumer consultation and preparation.  \n \n39.  Three additional candidate subprojects were identified and will be confirmed during project \nimplementation based on technical, social, and other considerations. Sequencing will not be a \nsignificant issue since the entire Project will be completed in 29 months. The project team will \nhelp DNSAS prepare a subproject appraisal report for each candidate subproject. Each appraisal \nreport will provide technical analysis and description, rationale, scope and components, cost \nestimates and financing plan, implementation arrangements, an initial environmental examination, \na resettlement plan, if required, and social and poverty impact assessment. The level of analysis \nand detail will be consistent with the size and characteristics of the subproject and the capacity of \nDNSAS to manage a similar program in other zones after project completion. DNSAS will submit \neach appraisal report for review and approval by ADB on a no-objection basis. Implementation \nmay proceed after endorsement by ADB and the MOI minister.  \n \n40.  A feasibility study (Supplementary Appendix E) was prepared for project activities to \noperate throughout the Dili water supply system. This work will involve the (i) repair of all obvious \nleaks; (ii) repair or replacement of existing stop valves and bulk meters, as necessary, and the \ninstallation  of  additional  stop  valves  and  bulk  meters  to  enhance  system  management;  (iii) \n ", " 11\ntransfer of service connections from old pipes to parallel new pipes to allow the disconnection of \nthe old pipes; and (iv) metering of all commercial premises and bulk water outlets.   \n \n41.  Eligibility Criteria. DNSAS and MOI, in consultation with the project team, will appraise \nsubprojects in accordance with eligibility criteria and procedures outlined in Appendix 7. \n \n42.  Subproject and Safeguard Plan Approvals. Subprojects are not expected to require \nland acquisition or resettlement but a precautionary land acquisition and resettlement framework \n(LARF) was prepared. The environmental assessment and review procedure (EARP) provides \nguidance for preparing initial environmental examinations (IEEs) for candidate subprojects, and \nenvironmental monitoring and institutional responsibilities for environmental management of the \nProject. Prior to the signing of supply and civil works contracts and the commencement of works \nand installation, MOI will submit to ADB for review and no-objection approval, the IEE related to \nthe subprojects. No indigenous peoples reside in Dili city as minority groups and no indigenous \npeoples  will  be  affected  by  project  activities.  Accordingly,  no  indigenous  peoples  plan  was \nprepared. \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n43.  Project implementation is scheduled to commence on 1 July 2008 and to operate over a \nperiod of twenty-nine months until 30 November 2010. Preconstruction activities for the three core \nsubprojects\u2014detailed  design,  preparation  of  bidding  documents,  tendering,  and  awarding  of \ncontracts for the first batch of subprojects\u2014will start around August 2008. Commencement of civil \nworks is targeted for January 2009, with completion in November 2010. The implementation \nschedule is attached as Appendix 8. \n \n4.  Procurement \n44.  The equipment, materials, and works financed by the proceeds of the ADB grant will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  \n \n45.  ADB\u2019s standard bid documents will be used for procuring ADB-financed goods and works. \nBefore commencement of national competitive bidding procurement, ADB and the grant recipient \nwill  review  the  grant  recipient\u2019s  procurement  procedures  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB \nrequirements. Any necessary modifications or clarifications of the grant recipient\u2019s procedure will \nbe documented in the procurement plan. Requirement of any environmental monitoring and \nmanagement plans (EMMPs) will be reflected in all civil works bidding and contract documents. \nProject implementation consultants will be recruited as soon as possible after grant effectiveness. \nThe procurement plan outlines (i) particular contracts for goods and works, (ii) proposed method \nfor procurement of goods and works financed by ADB, and (iii) related ADB review procedures. \nMOI, with ADB approval, will update the procurement plan as needed for the duration of the \nProject. The procurement plan and contract packages are detailed in Appendix 9. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n46.  Consulting  services  are  organized  in  two  packages.  The  package  for  project \nimplementation  support  will  engage  international  and  national  consultants  for  (i)  project \nmanagement;  (ii)  in-field  mentoring  of  leak  detection  teams  and  subzone  caretakers;  (iii) \nsocioeconomic monitoring and evaluation; and (iv) project financial management, reporting and \nauditing.  The  second  package  will  engage  international  and  national  consultants  to  prepare \ndetailed  engineering  design  and  documentation,  and  undertake  construction  supervision. \nConsultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \n ", "12  \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). All consulting services will be provided by \nfirms selected through international competition using quality-and-cost-based selection with a \nquality to cost weighting of 80:20. A total of 104 person-months of consulting services will be \nrequired for project implementation.  \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n47.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith MOI and DNSAS. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the Project.  To  support  these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  Building  customer \nawareness and empowerment can reduce the risk of corruption in water supply projects and \nservice delivery. The Dili Water Supply Performance Improvement TA will help build consumer \nadvocacy among DNSAS customers.    \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n48.  The grant proceeds for the sector Project will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  facilitate  project \nimplementation  and  funds  flow,  a  project  imprest  account  will  be  opened  at  a  domestic \ncommercial bank in Dili, acceptable to ADB. The financial management assessment indicates that \nDNSAS has limited capacity in internal control in financial management and so MOI will manage \nthe imprest account with assistance from the project implementation consultant firm. The imprest \naccount will be exclusively used to finance, as required, ADB\u2019s share of reasonable and eligible \nexpenditures under the (i) leak detection and repair works, (ii) installation of valve covers, marker \nposts, meter chambers, valves and meters; sundry repair and replacement works; and installation \nof chlorination equipment, and (iii) project management and capacity development. The direct \npayment procedures will apply for all other civil works, supplies and consulting contracts under \nthe Project. The initial advance to be deposited in the imprest account will not exceed either 6 \nmonths  of  estimated  expenditures  to  be  financed  from  the  imprest  account  or  $100,000, \nwhichever is lower. If the Government initially funds eligible expenditures from its own resources, \nreimbursement procedures will be used.  \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n49.  MOI, through the project implementation consultant, will maintain a separate account for \nthe Project and prepare separate financial statements, indicating sources and application of \nfunds, and have them audited by the international accountant engaged by the Project. The \naudited project accounts and the auditor\u2019s reports will be provided to ADB within 6 months after \nthe end of each financial year. MOI, through the project implementation consultant, will prepare \nand submit to ADB quarterly project progress reports and a project completion report within 3 \nmonths after the project completion. The ADB\u2019s policy on submission of audited accounts, which \ncovers failure to submit accounts and financial statements by due dates has been explained. If \nsubmission of an audited financial statement is delayed more than 6 months, ADB may not \napprove new contract awards. If the delay is more than 12 months, grant disbursements may be \nsuspended or the grant may be canceled. A separate auditor\u2019s opinion on use of the imprest \naccount procedure will be included in the audit report. \n \n ", " 13\n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n50.  MOI will establish a project performance monitoring system to facilitate the reporting \nrequirements. The system will assess progress and implementation of the Project, including \ncompliance with subproject EMMPs, and compliance with covenants of the grant agreement. In \nconjunction with the Dili Water Supply Performance Improvement TA, the project performance \nmonitoring system will help DNSAS monitor its operational efficiency, financial position, and \nprojections to enable performance benchmarking against other utilities.  \n \n10.  Project Review \n51.  The Project will be reviewed every 6 months. Each review will cover all institutional, \nadministrative, organizational, technical, environmental and social, economic, financial, and other \nrelevant aspects that may have an impact on the performance of the Project and its continuing \nviability. MOI and ADB will undertake a mid-term review 14 months after the start of the project \nimplementation. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n52.  The Project will sustainably improve water supply services for households, businesses, \nand institutions in Dili city. Sector project investments in valves, meters, distribution pipes and \nconnections will enable DNSAS to improve hydraulic efficiencies, reduce operating costs, and \nmanage  demand  including  reducing  water  losses.  Together  with  the  Dili  Water  Supply \nPerformance Improvement TA, DNSAS will halt and reverse the decline in water sales revenues, \nand  improve  its  technical  and  commercial  performance,  preparing  for  an  eventual  possible \nmanagement  contract.  The  Project  comprises  individual  subproject  investments  for  defined \nhydraulic subzones and neighborhoods. The subprojects introduce the Government\u2019s medium-\nterm urban WSS program for improving urban water supplies in all of Dili, Baucau, and in all \ndistrict centers.     \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Analyses \n53.  Households  without  a  piped  connection  (62%  of  project  area)  rely  on  shallow  wells, \nshallow tubewells, springs, neighbors\u2019 taps, and public tanks. In Dili, all zones suffer from water \nstress in the dry season. Consequently, during the dry months obtaining water for basic needs \nbecomes more time consuming as households have to go farther to find a water source. Similarly, \nconnected households with intermittent supply must obtain water from secondary sources once \nstored water is used. Non-domestic water supply customers will benefit financially due to an \nimproved supply without the need to resort to more costly tanker supplies. \n \n54.  Economic benefits arise from increases in improved  water supply to both piped and \nnonpiped domestic users and commercial customers from reduction in time and costs of obtaining \nwater. In addition, a reduction in water losses from an estimated 70%\u201325% in the subzone \nsubproject areas allows more water to be available in other areas of the city and/or a reduction in \npumping, chemical, and O&M costs as less water production is required. Households using clean \npotable water rather than water from polluted shallow wells and streams will experience health \nbenefits. The Project will reduce the high incidence of malaria and dengue fever in Dili since \nreducing leaks will reduce pooling and more reliable piped supplies will reduce household water \nstorage. \n \n55.  An economic analysis of the three core subprojects based on time and cost savings was \ncompleted (Appendix 10). The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 20.2% and the economic \nnet present value (ENPV) at 12% is $1.34 million. An analysis to test the sensitivity of the \n ", "14  \neconomic internal rate of return of the combined subzone subprojects to adverse changes in key \nvariables demonstrates the results are robust to adverse changes. The variables tested are \nincreases (+10%) in capital and O&M costs, reduction in subproject benefits (-10%), and a 2-year \ndelay in project implementation and benefits. In the case of the 2-year delay, with costs spread \nover an extra 2 years and a further 20% to reflect additional costs incurred, the economic internal \nrate of return falls to 13.4%.  \n \n56.  Appendix 10 also presents the financial analysis which considers project-related revenue \nand chemical and electricity savings costs from water-loss reductions. The financial internal rate \nof return (FIRR) is calculated at 2.5% for the subprojects and the financial net present value at the \nweighted average cost of capital (WACC) is computed as $0.56 million. The FIRR compares \nfavorably with the estimated weighted average cost of capital of 1.0%, substantiating the Project\u2019s \nfinancial viability. The average incremental financial cost is $0.25 per m3 compared with the \naverage financial tariff of $0.29 per m3. The sensitivity analyses demonstrates the results are \nrobust to standard sensitivities, but if the Project is delayed 2 years and costs increase by 20%, \nthen the FIRR falls to 1.2%; if the collection efficiency falls to 70% instead of the assumed 90%, \nthe FIRR falls to 1.1%. \n \n57.  Thus  the  Project  is  most  sensitive  to  delays  and  consequent  corresponding  cost \nincreases. Accordingly, efforts have been made in project design to avoid such delays and cost \nincreases. These are detailed in the subproject appraisal report (Supplementary Appendix D). \nThe economic and financial analyses are detailed in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n58.  DNSAS has limited autonomy in decision-making other than for basic operating matters. \nAll financing, fees and charges, staffing, infrastructure development and procurement decisions \nrequire  the  prior  approval  of  MOI,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  or  Ministry  of  State \nAdministration. The annual budget for all Government departments is set out in the General \nBudget  of  the  State.  MOF  regulations  cover  budget  and  financial  management,  and \nappropriations. A Banking and Payments Authority makes all Government payments. Treasury (a \ndepartment within MOF) receives all Government revenues, acts as paymaster and performs the \naccounting function of Government. Accordingly, DNSAS is required to submit all applications for \nongoing day-to-day funding to MOF, all revenues collected are banked and passed directly to \nTreasury.  \n \n59.  For the 12 months ending 30 June 2007, DNSAS\u2019s total budget was $3.1 million, with \n$1.823 million for operations. Dili water supply accounts for $1.104 million (60.6%) to cover water, \nwastewater management, and solid waste services. Cost recovery from users through water \ntariffs has been limited. Since independence, customers have only been billed for a period of 16 \nmonths, November 2004\u2013April 2006. In the 12 months ending 30 June 2006, $58,000 was \ncollected from customers, representing 7% of Dili water supply operating costs. \n \n60.  Financial projections prepared for Dili show that cost recovery of operating costs would be \nachieved by 2017, following full metering of all customers by 2014 and a tariff increase in real \nterms of 29% in 2014. This would ensure financial sustainability of Dili\u2019s operations. The current \nDili tariff has a lifeline block up to 14 m3 at a lower tariff to protect the poor and ensure water \ncharges  are  affordable.  Following  the  tariff  increase,  the  monthly  water  bill  of  low-income \nconsumers for 14 m3 would represent 3.2% of household income compared with 3.0% under the \ncurrent tariff. For an average income household consuming 25 m3 per month, the water bill would \nrepresent 3.7% of household income, a similar level to the tariff in FY2008. (The DNSAS financial \nanalysis and tariffs are detailed in Appendix 11 and Supplementary Appendix F). \n \n ", " 15\n \nB.  Impacts \n61.  The due diligence undertaken for the three subprojects appraised does not indicate land \nacquisition or involuntary resettlement impacts. Due diligence to be undertaken for candidate \nsubprojects should not identify any land acquisition or involuntary resettlement impacts. However, \na LARF was prepared (Appendix 12 and Supplementary Appendix G). It provides a mechanism to \nscreen candidate subprojects and\u2014if the need arises\u2014provide guidance on how to prepare and \nimplement  subsequent  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  procedures.  Dili  city  contains  no \nindigenous peoples at present, thus, no indigenous peoples will be impacted by the Project. With \nsupport from the Dili Infrastructure Project Management TA, MOI and DNSAS will strengthen their \nenvironmental and social impact assessment and management capabilities and TA specialists will \nbe available to support project implementation. In keeping with the Project\u2019s alignment principles, \nenvironmental  and  other  safeguard  considerations  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  DNSAS \nDevelopment and Planning Division, Division of Administration, Dili Water and Sanitation Division \n(for planning and implementation), and the MOI Corporate Services Directorate (for oversight). \nThe Project will finance and help build skills and systems in a new Environment and Social Unit, \nto be located in the DNSAS Development and Planning Division. \n \n  1.  Social and Gender \n62.  A summary poverty reduction and social strategy was developed based on the findings of \nan initial poverty reduction and social assessment, and social surveys. During project preparation, \nparticipatory  approaches  were  undertaken,  including  consultations  with  representatives  of \ncommunities, government agencies, and other stakeholders. Focus group consultations were \nheld with women. Women indicated a high willingness to pay for improved water supplies and \nwomen  are  expected  to  benefit  disproportionately  from  improved  water  supply  services.  All \nreasonable and necessary steps will be taken to encourage women living in the project area to \nparticipate in the final design and implementation of subprojects and in the selection and design \nof candidate subprojects (paragraph 69). A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is \npresented  in  Appendix  13  and  the  findings  of  the  socioeconomic  survey  and  subsequent \nrecommendations are set out in Supplementary Appendix H. Socio economic profiles of each \ncore subproject are also included in subproject appraisal reports (Supplementary Appendix D). In \nthe subzone 1, it is estimated that 23% of households have per capita incomes below the \nNational poverty line of $0.55 per day and 30% have per capita incomes between $0.55 and $1.0 \nper day. In subzones 2 and 3, the equivalent estimates are 36% and 27%, and 24% and 39% \nrespectively.  \n \n  2.  Environmental \n63.  The proposed core subprojects are categorized as environmental category B. IEEs and \nthe EMMPs were prepared for the core subprojects in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003),  and  the  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental requirements as set out in the applicable laws and regulations.12 A summary IEE is \nattached  as  Appendix  14  and  IEEs  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  I.  The  proposed  core \nsubprojects will be located in urban areas and have no sensitive environmental implications. No \nsignificant cumulative impacts are identified. Moreover, the proposed core subprojects are limited \nto rehabilitation of the existing facilities. All potential environmental impacts can be properly \nmitigated and minimized to acceptable levels.  \n                                                 \n12 Timor-Leste is building an environmental legal framework, including an environmental impact assessment  law. Until \nlaws are promulgated, environmental matters are governed by applicable regulations of the United Nations Transition \nAuthority for East Timor. Indonesian laws, which were in force up to 1999 and that have broader coverage than the \nUnited Nations regulations, lack the political legitimacy for them to be enforced in Timor-Leste. \n ", "16  \n  \n64.  The  IEEs  and  EMMPs,  which  will  be  prepared  for  all  candidate  subprojects,  will  be \nincluded  in  the  feasibility  reports  for  submission  to  ADB  and  to  the  secretary  of  state  for \nenvironment  after  Timor-Leste\u2019s  environmental  management  enabling  legislation  is \npromulgated.13 An EMMP will be required for subprojects classified as environmental category B. \nSubproject feasibility reports will identify adequate funding for EMMPs. Subproject EMMPs will be \nreflected in the bid documents, incorporated into project design, and included in contractors\u2019 \ncontracts for subprojects. The project team and contractors will be guided by the EMMPs in \nmanaging  and  monitoring  impacts.  The  EMMP  will  include  requirements  for  reporting \nenvironmental compliance. Civil works and supply contracts may only be signed and works \ncommence after the IEE reports of subprojects are approved by ADB. \n \n65.  An EARP prepared in accordance with the ADB guidelines will guide the preparation and \napproval procedures of environmental assessments of candidate subprojects under DNSAS\u2019s \nurban  water  supply  program,  and  describe  institutional  responsibilities  for  environmental \nmanagement. The EARP is detailed in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \nC.  Assumptions and Risks \n66.  Civil Disorder in Dili. Escalating civil disorder and violence in Dili would disrupt project \nimplementation and make maintaining improved services and improving financial performance \ndifficult for DNSAS. Timor-Leste is now politically stable following successful presidential and \nparliamentary elections earlier in 2007; the new Government is functioning normally. Internally \ndisplaced people are being resettled. Some United Nations policing is likely for several years.   \n \n67.  Retention of Leak Detection Teams and Caretakers. Keeping water losses low and \nextending the leak detection program to other zones requires DNSAS to retain the three leak \ndetection teams after the Project. Likewise, the six subzone caretakers recruited and trained \nunder the Dili Water Supply Performance Improvement TA must be retained permanently by \nDNSAS to sustain the Project approach in the three target zones: reliable supply of clean water to \nthe  houses  or  businesses  in  exchange  for  on-time  payment  of  a  fair  tariff.  The  minister  of \ninfrastructure provided an assurance of both these requirements. If the DNSAS staff ceiling is to \nbe exceeded, the additional personnel will be retained on long-term contracts or the work could \nbe outsourced to a local nongovernment organization. \n \n68.  Revenue  Performance:  Retention  of  Revenues.  Project  sustainability  and  success \ndepends critically on customers in Dili paying for their improved water supply service.  The project \ndesign  mitigates  this  risk  as  follows  (Supplementary  Appendixes  B  and  D):  (i)  households, \nincluding low income women households, confirmed in discussions and surveys their willingness \nto pay for water, provided the service is good and reliable\u2014the subzone approach is designed to \nachieve  good  reliable  water  supplies  to  customers;  (ii)    subzone  caretakers  will  intensively \nmanage  services  and  customer  relations  in  each  subzone,  including  (a)  monitoring  service \nquality, (b) taking and responding to customer needs and complaints, (c) helping with minor \nrepairs, including meters, (d) helping with billing and collections, (e) reporting illegal connections, \nand (f) delivering outreach messages encouraging good water use practices and the need to pay \nwater bills; (iii)  regularize and meter and re-meter all connections in subzones and all commercial \nconnections in Dili; (iv) reinstitute billing and collections in accordance with Ministerial Order \n1/2004 on schedule of fees and charges, initially focusing on high usage customers; and (v) \n                                                 \n13 The environmental impact assessment bill is likely to be promulgated in 2008. Under the bill, the responsible \nauthority for issuing EIAs and approvals will be the secretary of state for environment within the ministry of economic \nand development. Ahead of the EIA law, there remains no clear responsibility for environmental assessments and \napprovals within the Government. \n ", " 17\nstrengthen  DNSAS\u2019s  support  services  section  (meter  management)  and  customer  services \nsection  through  the  Dili  Water  Supply  Performance  Improvement  TA.  DNSAS  management \nconfirmed its willingness to disconnect delinquent accounts, pursuant to Decree Law 4/2004 on \nWater  Supply  for  Public  Consumption.  The  Government  is  committed  to  improving  revenue \nperformance and reducing subsidies for water (and electricity) services, but much depends on \nsecurity conditions in Dili (paragraph 66). As revenues build, DNSAS should be designated a \nrevenue-retaining agency rather than have its revenues go into the state consolidated revenue \naccount. This reform element is included in a draft ministerial order for the \u201creinstitution\u201d of \nDNSAS as an independent public entity prepare in 2004. Water tariffs are discussed in Appendix \n11 and elaborated, together with a discussion on DNSAS finances, in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \n69.  Commitment to Concentrated Investments, Zonal Approach. Dili city water supply \nservices should not be extended into new areas prematurely; doing this would compromise the \nsystem hydraulically and would reduce the efficacy of the zonal approach. Investments should \nconcentrate on rolling out the subzone process until the entire program is completed.   \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n70.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Counterpart financing. The Government will make available on a timely basis a \ntotal of $1.5 million from its ordinary budgetary allocations as counterpart financing \nto ensure timely completion of the Project. \n(ii)  Project management. The Government, through MOI, will arrange the project \nteam to be located in the Corporate Services Directorate of MOI and in DNSAS, \nand will provide office accommodation for all members of the project team, and will \nensure close cooperation between the project team and MOI and DNSAS staff, \nincluding provision of all necessary data and information to the project team in a \ntimely manner. \n(iii)  Environment.  The  Government,  through  DNSAS  will  ensure  that  for  every \nsubproject: (a) an IEE, environmental impact assessment (as necessary), and \nEMMP will be prepared in accordance with the project EARP, consistent with (1) \napplicable national environmental laws, regulations, and guidelines, as and when \nsuch laws, regulations and guidelines are adopted and become effective, and (2) \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002); (b) the EMMP in the IEE is part of the bidding \ndocuments  and  civil  works  contracts;  (c)  any  adverse  environmental  impacts \narising  from  the  Project  are  minimized  by  implementing  the  agreed  mitigation \nmeasures;  and  (d)  environmental  monitoring  is  done  by  the  construction \nsupervision team. Prior to signing of any works contract under the subproject and \nthe commencement of works, MOI shall submit to ADB for review and approval on \na no-objection basis, the IEE related to the subproject. \n(iv)  Subproject approval. All subprojects will be prepared, selected and submitted for \napproval by ADB in accordance with the procedures and eligibility criteria agreed \nbetween the Government and ADB. The Government will ensure that DNSAS will \nsubmit a SPAR for each candidate subproject to ADB for no-objection approval \nbefore  proceeding  with  detailed  engineering  design  and  construction  of  the \nsubproject.  \n(v)  Project performance monitoring and evaluation. The Government, through the \nproject team, assisted by the international and national consultants engaged under \nthe Project, will monitor and evaluate project impacts. The Government will discuss \n ", "18  \nand  agree  with  ADB  on  the  indicators  and  baseline  data  prepared  by  these \nconsultants prior to the commencement of civil works, and will ensure that the \nconsultants monitor and compare the data during project implementation and at \nproject completion. To the extent possible, the indicators and baseline data will \nmake full use of gender-disaggregated data and information. \n(vi)  All works within existing easements. The Government will ensure that (a) all \nsubproject  works  are  undertaken  within  existing  water  supply  facility  sites, \neasements, and public rights-of-way, and that (b) all subprojects are screened in \nview of potential resettlement impacts in accordance with the LARF (Appendix 12 \nand Supplementary Appendix G) to ensure no land acquisition or resettlement is \nrequired.  If  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement  is  unavoidable,  the \nGovernment  will  (a)  prepare  a  resettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and the LARF; (b) submit it to ADB for \napproval  prior  to  civil  works  contract  award;  and  (c)  ensure  that  payment  of \ncompensation or relocation to new sites have been satisfactorily completed prior to \nland acquisition activities and demolition. The Government will ensure that the \nresettlement plan will include detailed measurement surveys, compensation unit \nrates  based  on  replacement  cost  surveys  for  all  categories  of  losses  and \nallowances, and a final database of affected persons. The Government will also \nensure that timely and adequate budgetary support is fully committed and made \navailable to cover the costs of land acquisition, resettlement, and relocation within \nthe project implementation period. \n(vii)  Retention of project staff. The Government will cause MOI to retain as regular or \ncontractual  staff  of  DNSAS,  or  contract  through  a  firm  or  nongovernment \norganization,  all  nine  members  of  the  three  leak  detection  teams  and  all  six \nsubzone  caretakers  (one  subzone  caretaker  for  approximately  every  1,000 \nconnections throughout the project area) recruited and trained under the Dili Water \nSupply  Performance  Improvement  TA,  provided  that  those  retained  will  have \nperformed their duties satisfactorily. \n(viii)  Operation  and  maintenance  budget.  The  Government  will  make  timely \nbudgetary allocations to DNSAS for costs related to subzone O&M, estimated at \naround $17,000 per annum per subzone. \n(ix)  DNSAS institutional development. The Government will, by 30 November 2009, \nhave approved a ministerial order setting out a roadmap for organizing DNSAS \ninto an independent public entity with appropriate management, technical, and \nfinancial autonomy.   \n(x)  DNSAS  revenue  performance.  The  Government  will  ensure  that,  by  31 \nDecember 2009, DNSAS has reinstituted its revenue improvement program, with a \ntarget to increase during FY2010 the number of billed customers by a minimum \n20% and the amount of gross water supply revenue by 30%. The Government will \nensure that the demand management task force, established within DNSAS under \nthe Dili Water Supply Performance Improvement TA, is mandated to carry on \nreducing NRW in other water zones in the project area. \n(xi)  DNSAS performance benchmarking. The Government will ensure that, by 30 \nNovember 2009, DNSAS has instituted a performance benchmarking program, \npreferably  in  association  with  the  World  Bank-supported  IBNet  for  water  and \nsanitation utilities (Supplementary Appendix B). \n(xii)  Public  consultation  and  participation. The Government will ensure that: (a) \nadequate public consultations are conducted with local communities on certain \naspects  of  the  Project  during  implementation,  including  but  not  limited  to  the \narrangements for bill paying and provision of water for houses without direct street \n ", " 19\naccess; (b) all reasonable and necessary steps are taken to encourage women \nliving  in  the  project  area  to  participate  in  the  preparation,  design  and \nimplementation  of  subprojects;  and  (c)  women  are  primary  targets  for  any \ncommunity-based  promotion  activities,  including  but  not  limited  to  activities \ndesigned to promote good water use behavior. \n(xiii)  Labor standards. The Government will ensure that all installation and civil works \ncontracts  under  the  Project  incorporate  provisions  to  ensure  that  contractors \ncomply with the Government\u2019s applicable labor laws and regulations. In particular, \nall installation and civil works contractors engaged for subprojects will be required \nto (a) provide equal employment opportunity to male and female employees, (b) \nprovide equal pay to male and female employees for work of equal value, and (c) \nnot employ child labor in the subprojects work. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n71.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the grant not exceeding \nthe equivalent of $6,000,000 to the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources for the Dili Urban Water Supply Sector Project, on terms and conditions that are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n26 November 2007 \n \n ", " 20  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved water supply  Percentage of Dili  DNSAS customer  \u2022 Dili is peaceful and stable, and \nservices for households,  population receiving 24- registration records,  neighborhoods normalize \nbusinesses, and  hour piped water supply  consumption records and  including the resettlement of \ninstitutions in Dili city   increased from 25% in  field surveys  internally displaced people \n  2007 to 80% by 2015    \u2022 Government replicates new \n  DNSAS customer  water supply infrastructure \nCustomer satisfaction with  complaints records   improvements in all Dili water \nDili piped water supply  Structured customer  supply zones  \nservices improved, with less  surveys, gender  \u2022 MOI and/or DNSAS retain \nthan 180 complaints per  disaggregated   project leak detection team \n1,000 customers per year by  members and retains/engages \n2015  one subzone caretaker for \n  every 1,000 connections \nWomen perceive significant  throughout the Dili service area \nbenefits from improved  \u2022 MOI and/or DNSAS allocate \nwater supply services to  sufficient budget and technical \ntheir households  resources to properly operate \n  and maintain Dili water supply \n  systems \n\u2022 Government implements \nreforms to strengthen the \nfinancial, technical, and \nmanagerial autonomy of \nDNSAS, including retention of \nearned revenues \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved hydraulic  NRW ratio for Dili city water  DNSAS customer, billing,  \u2022 Water production and main \nmanagement of the Dili  supply reduced from 95% to  production, and  distribution infrastructure and \nwater supply system  40\u201350% by month 29  consumption records   facilities recently upgraded \nand more efficient      continue to function properly \ntertiary distribution  NRM ratio for the three  Procurement contracts and  and deliver water to the service \ntarget zones reduced from  monthly demand  area as designed. \n95% to 25\u201330% by month  management task force  \u2022 Residents in neighborhoods \n29  report  cooperate with project teams. \n  \u2022 DNSAS provides efficient and \nPercentage of the population  effective management and \nin the three target zones  administration procedures for \nreceiving 24-hour piped  customer registration, metering \nwater supply increased from  and billing. \n40% in 2006 to 80% by 2009  \u2022 Procurement agencies provide \n  efficient and effective \nProcurement contracts let,  procurement support.    \nNRW targets set and work \nplans in place for ongoing \nleak detection and NRW \nreduction work in future \ntarget zones by month 29 \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

Water Supply and Sanitation Overview \n1.  Background \n1.  Sector Management. Under the fourth constitutional Government sworn into office in \nAugust 2007, the new Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI) has primary responsibility for managing \nwater supply and sanitation (WSS) in Timor-Leste. The secretary of state for electricity, water, \nand urbanization reports to the minister. An MOI organic law is being prepared to clarify \nprecise arrangements, roles, and responsibilities for the various offices that will directly and \nindirectly influence WSS sector development, for instance the previous Corporate Services \nDirectorate of the previous responsible ministry. The National Directorate for Water Supply and \nSanitation (DNSAS) is responsible for developing, managing, operating, and maintaining urban \nand rural WSS systems throughout Timor-Leste. It manages 13 urban water supply systems, \nthe largest being Dili city. DNSAS is a directorate within MOI, with no financial and little \nmanagerial autonomy. Other important stakeholder agencies include (i) Office of the Prime \nMinister and Council of Ministers (COM), for policy, planning, and regulation; (ii) Ministry of \nEconomy and Development for environmental protection and Ministry of Agriculture, Forests, \nand Fisheries for water resources management; (iii) Ministry of Health for public health and \ncommunity education and awareness; and (iv) other MOI directorates for urban drainage and \nother local environmental aspects. \n \n2.  Legislative Framework. In February 2004, COM adopted the Water Services Decree, \nwhich provides for the management of water services delivery, including provisions for the \nidentification of areas to be supplied and application of service user charges. Two subsidiary \nministerial diplomas concurrently set water supply tariffs for Dili and main towns in districts, and \nformalized management arrangements for multivillage piped water systems in rural areas. The \nWater Services Decree allows for the corporatization of DNSAS. Other relevant legislation \nincludes (i) sanitation management decree (drafted but not yet considered by COM); (ii) Public \nSanitation Decree (2005); (iii) national water policy and legislative framework (drafted and \nconsidered, but not yet passed by COM); (iv) law on environmental impact assessment and \nguidelines (drafted but not yet considered by COM); (v) law on pollution control (drafted but not \nyet considered by COM); and (vi) law on protected areas (under discussion). \n \n3.  Access to Water Supply. National estimates of access to water supply in Timor-Leste \nare not reliable because of definitional inconsistencies and data gaps.1 But two things are \nclear: access nationally is low by regional standards, and access overall has improved little \nsince restoration of independence in 2002, and in many areas has worsened. In 2001, access \nto water varied across Timor-Leste. About 42% of the population of the western districts had \naccess to safe water, 48% in central districts, and 50% in eastern districts. The 2003 figures in \nTable A2.1 are derived from interviews with DNSAS staff, adjusted for ongoing projects. But \nrehabilitated and new rural (piped) water supply systems in Timor-Leste have been difficult to \nsustain and the figures are not adjusted for probable system failures. Access to safe water in \nurban  centers  has  probably  declined  since  2001,  again  because  systems  have  been \ninadequately maintained and have lost service efficiency. Earlier estimates for access to safe \nwater could have been too optimistic. An informal survey in December 2004 indicated that \nabout 41% of the urban population and 30% of the rural population had access to safe water. \n                                                 \n1  A thorough discussion of definitional issues and data gaps is available in the draft Water Supply and Sanitation: \nPriorities and Proposed Sector Investment Program, September 2007 (Update 2007). \n ", " 24  Appendix 2 \nOf households with access to safe water supply, the United Nations Development Programme2 \nestimated in 2004 that only 13% had piped house connections and 16% used community taps. \nThe remainder mostly used protected wells and spring sources.   \n \n4.  Access to Sanitation. In 2001, only 42% of the overall population had access to \nadequate sanitation.3 In 2001, almost 45% (and 49% in 2002) indicated they did not use any \nform of toilet facility, instead using ponds, fields, etc., for their sanitary needs. In rural areas, \nanecdotal reports from health and other professionals indicate rural access may still be below \n10%, especially in western districts. In urban areas, the 2002 survey suggests that a significant \n22% of the total urban population did not have access to any toilet facility, with another 21% \nusing open pits without septic tanks. In Dili, 31% did not have a septic tank connected to their \ntoilet facility. The Timor-Leste Millennium Development Goal (MDG) Report 2004 cited access \nto sanitation as 19% total, 44% urban, and 10% rural in 2001. \n \n2.  Dili Water Supply \n5.  Water  Supply  Infrastructure.  Dili  city\u2019s  water  supply  system  comprises  four  river \nintakes, nine functioning deep bores, 31 kilometers (km) of raw water transmission mains, four \nwater  treatment  plants,  seven  service  reservoirs,  and  200  km  of  distribution  mains.  The \ndistribution network is divided into 10 water supply zones. While some are separate zones \ncontrolled by boundary valves, others are theoretical zones only. Over the past 5 years, the \nGovernment  of  Timor-Leste,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB), and other donors have made substantial investments4 in raw water transmission \ncapacity, water treatment plant capacity, and the distribution network in 8 of the service area\u2019s \n10  water  supply  zones.  These  elements  of  Dili\u2019s  water  supply  system  are  in  reasonable \ncondition and have adequate capacity, although raw water intakes and transmission mains are \noccasionally damaged by floods and landslides. But tertiary pipes and service connections are \nin  poor  condition  and  contribute  substantially  to  the  high  leakage  rates.  The  distribution \nnetwork reaches about 80% of the entire Dili water service area (the 10 water supply zones).  \n \n6.  Service. DNSAS estimates (March 2006) that only about 43% of Dili\u2019s households have \nauthorized piped water supply connections, while a further 10% use public taps or tanks (Table \nA2.1). An estimated 22% of households have unauthorized connections. In total, around 87% \nof  households  take  water  directly  from  the  piped  water  supply  system.  In  zone  3  and \nelsewhere, smallholder farmers use DNSAS treated piped water for crop irrigation. Only about \n25%\u201330% of DNSAS authorized customers, mainly in zones 1 and 10, have 24-hour supply \nwith good pressure. The other zones experience high leakage, low or variable pressure, and \nintermittent supply with water available for only about 10\u201316 hours per day. Many urban \nneighborhoods, particularly in low-income areas, rely on contaminated water from shallow \nwells or boreholes and streams. The poor service and low coverage are largely caused by \n                                                 \n2  United Nations Development Programme. 2004. Timor-Leste Human Development Report: Paths Out of Poverty. \nDili. \n3  The definition of adequate sanitation is an adequate excreta disposal facility, such as a connection to a sewer or \nseptic tank system, a pour-flush toilet, or a simple pit or \u201cVIP\u201d latrine. An excreta disposal system is considered \nadequate if it is private or shared (but not public) and it can effectively prevent human, animal, and insect contact \nwith excreta. \n4  Recent and ongoing construction works in April 2006: Japan International Cooperation Agency -funded project \nhas completed distribution system upgrading in zone 4, and continues to upgrade distribution in zones 1, 3, 5, 6, \n7, and 8, which is scheduled for completion by September 2006. ADB had previously upgraded the distribution \nnetwork in zone 10. DNSAS is replacing some tertiary pipes in zones 2 and 4, and is reinstalling meters in zones \n1, 2, 3, and 4. DNSAS also plans to relocate a package water treatment plant from Benamau to treat raw water \nfrom Maloa intake, which currently supplies raw water to a 60 cubic meter service reservoir servicing a small part \nof the system. \n ", "  Appendix 2  25\n(i) lack of tertiary pipes; (ii) poor condition of tertiary pipes and service connections, and; \n(iii) poor demand management. Complaints of no water and low pressure make up almost one \nthird of consumer complaints. \n \nTable A2.1: Conditions in Dili City\u2019s 10 Water Supply Zones \nArea  % of \nCategory  \n(hectares)  Total Area \nGoodPressure 1,411  50 \nMix of Good and Low Pressure  336  12 \nLow Pressure  452  16 \nOwn Supply (Airport) 65  2 \nNo Connection  42  1 \nPublic Taps  21  1 \nMaloa Raw Water System  28  1 \nNo Supply  485  17 \n  Total  2,841  100 \n          Source: National Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n7.  Average  daily  water  demand  is  about  29,000  cubic  meters  per  day,  while  water \ntreatment plant capacity has reached 11,200 cubic meters per day through the Government of \nJapan-funded project to upgrade three water treatment plants plus the program to upgrade the \ncentral  water  treatment  plant.  The  shortfall  in  supply  comes  from  nine  functioning  deep \nboreholes  that  supply  adequate  quality  water  without  treatment  other  than  chlorination. \nGenerally, Dili\u2019s piped water supply is not safe to drink directly from the tap. Many urban \nhouseholds use alternative more reliable supplies. Water quality is acceptable at treatment \nplant outlets, but quickly deteriorates within the distribution system due to low or negative \npressure and lack of adequate watermain maintenance. More than half of Dili households rely \non shallow wells for water supply\u2014solely reliant or to supplement the piped water supply\u2014and \nmost premises have some form of storage to collect water when flowing from the piped system \n(Table A2.2). About 3% of households rely on tanker trucks. A few small-scale entrepreneurs \nprovide water.  \n \nTable A2.2: Registered and Unregistered Connections in Dili City \nDescription  Number of  Persons per  Population  % of Total \n   Connections  Connectiona  Served  Population \nRegistered Household Connections  9,174  7  64,220  41 \nUnregistered Household Connections  8,300  7  58,100  37 \nPublic Taps or Tanks  91  140  12,740  8 \nTotal      135,060  87 \nTotal Population      160,000  100 \na  The 2004 census reported 5.5 persons per household, 6.0 persons per dwelling, and 6.9 persons per occupied \n  dwelling in Dili.

Water Access and Demand in Informal Areas. Household surveys5 by the Dili Slum \nUpgrading Project in 2004 found that informal settlement areas account for about 15,500 (78%) \nof Dili\u2019s estimated 20,000 households, and are characterized by low population density, large \n                                                 \n5  A total of 2,769 dwelling units were surveyed representing nearly 20% of the housing stock of the city. The \nsurveys included housing inventory; assessment; socioeconomic attributes; areas of high, medium, and low \npriority; key issues and neighborhood priorities; infrastructure condition; basic service delivery; and upgrading \nneeds. A further 220 dwelling units were interviewed in greater detail to clarify key issues and conditions. \n ", " 26  Appendix 2 \nhousehold  size  (average  7.9  persons  per  dwelling  unit),  poor  quality  housing,  and  poor \ndrainage.  Improved  water  supply  was  consistently  the  highest  development  priority  of \nrespondents.  The  project  estimated  that  some  98  underserved  areas  with  about  46,000 \nresidents (i.e., 28% of the total urban population) across the city would require upgrading in the \nshort to medium term, and recommended a 4-year upgrading program at an estimated cost of \n$3.59 million,6 including about $0.40 million for water supply and $0.48 million for sanitation. \n \n9.  Water  Meters.  Only  22%  (2,350)  of  9,972  authorized  customers  have  operating \nmetered connections. Many existing meters are broken or faulty; some have been deliberately \ndamaged,  removed,  or  tampered  with  to  produce  faulty  readings.  To  meter  all  currently \nnonmetered Dili connections in the medium term would require around 1,800 meters to be \ninstalled each year over the next 4 years. DNSAS currently has a stock of 9,500 uninstalled \nmeters, sufficient to complete metering of all current authorized customers in Dili (Table 2.3).    \n \nTable A2.3: Reported Connections and Consumption in March 2006 \n   \nConnections  Customers  Consumption \nWater \nClassification \n    Sold \nAuthorized   Metered  Billed   Paying  Authorized   Billed  \n  (number)    (m3/month) \nHouseholds  9,174  2,132    2,132  169    247,698  57,564  4,563 \nOffices  150  56    56  0    450  168  0 \nBusiness     \n249  78  78  9  7,470  2,340  270 \n(large) \nBusiness     \n218  50  50  6  3,270  750  90 \n(small) \nIndustrial     \n22  22  22  11  990  990  495 \n(large) \nIndustrial     \n0  0  0  0  0  0  0 \n(small) \nPublic Taps  91  0    0  0    10,920  0  0 \nSociala  68  12    12  0    204  36  0 \nWater Tankers              894  894  894 \nTotal  9,972  2,350    2,350  195    271,896  62,742  6,312 \n% Production              36%  8%  1% \nm3 = cubic meter. \na Social includes schools, hospitals, churches, and government offices. \nNote: Reported monthly water production in March 2006 was 757,575 m3. \nSource: National Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation records. \n \n10.  Water Balance. Dili\u2019s water supply system is losing massive amounts of water and \nmoney, and relies almost entirely on government subsidies. In September 2007, nonrevenue \nwater7 was 100%, as no consumers were being billed for water used and no payments were \nreceived  (Table  A2.4).  Nevertheless  15%  of  the  water  distributed  from  headworks  was \nreticulated  through  water  meters  and  if  this  water  was  billed  and  paid  for,  a  theoretical \nnonrevenue water of 85% is calculated and used for this exercise. Other water losses are \naround 70%. DNSAS commenced billing and collecting revenue from its Dili water supply \ncustomers in 2005, in line with the Water Services Decree 2004. By then, only 2,350 (24%) of \n                                                 \n6  Direct costs exclude administration, consultants, and contingencies. The project estimated unit upgrading costs of \n$450 per dwelling unit for 5,950 dwelling units (7,970 households) in 98 target communities. The unit costs for \nwater supply were $50 per dwelling unit and for sanitation $60.  \n7  Nonrevenue water is the difference between water supplied and water sold (i.e., billed irrespective of whether it is \npaid for or not) expressed as a percentage of water supplied by the water production facilities. \n ", "  Appendix 2  27\nauthorized customers were metered, and in March 2006 only 9% of metered customers (about \n2%  of  all  authorized  customers)  paid  for  piped  water.  The  number  of  paying  customers \ndecreased inexplicably from about 900 to 195 between January and March 2006. From the \nonset of the national crisis in April 2006 until now, billing and collections ceased. \n \nFigure A24: Water Balance for Dili City in September 2007  \n    Billed  Billed Metered Consumption  0%  Revenue \n  Authorized  Authorized  (paid)  0   Water \n  Consumption  Consumption  m3/month  15% \n  30%  15%  Billed Metered Consumption  15%  137,924 \n  275,848  137,924  (not paid)  137,924  m3/month \nSystem  m3/month  m3/month  m3/month   \nInput    Billed Nonmetered Consumption  0%   \nVolume  0  \n100%  m3/month \n919,494  Unbilled  Unbilled Metered Consumption  0%   \nm3/ month  Authorized    0   \n  Consumption  m3/month   \n  15%  Unbilled Nonmetered Consumption  15%  Non-\n137,924  137,924  revenue \nm3/month  Water \n  Apparent  Unauthorized Consumption  Not Known  15 plus \n  Losses  Metering Inaccuracies  Not Known  70% \nWater Losses  Not Known    unknowns \n70%    Leakage on Transmission and  Not Known  = \n643,646    Distribution Mains  85% \nm3/month  Physical  Leakage and Overflows at Storage  Not Known  781,570 \n  Losses  Tanks  m3/month \nNot Known  Leakage on Service Connections up  Not Known   \nto the Customers\u2019 Meters \nm3 = cubic meters. \nSource: National Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation; and Asian Development Bank. 2005.

Sector Policy and Programming \n1.  Sector Investment Plan Update 2007 \n12.  The draft WSS sector investment program 2008\u20132012 was completed in September \n2007 and by project fact-finding was being considered by the new Government. The 17 sector \ninvestment programs/update reports produced each year have been the Government\u2019s key \nprogram budgeting tool since 2004; they underpin the formulation of annual national budgets \nand  include  a  5-year  rolling  investment  plan.  The  draft  2008\u20132012  plan  comprises  a \ncomprehensive and technically sound national WSS strategy and the Government\u2019s WSS \nsector planning and budgeting. \n \n13.  Since  before  the  2006  national  crisis\u2014and  especially  since\u2014the  Government  and \ndevelopment partners have recognized the urgent need for the Government to execute an \naccelerated program of public works in order to create jobs and improve service delivery. The \nFY2007  national  budget  quadrupled  the  national  capital  development  program.  The  new \nGovernment is likely to continue with this policy and the WSS sector investment program \n2008\u20132012 assumes some kind of a program for accelerated national development. It includes \nDili city among several target districts for accelerated WSS investments. It explicitly programs \n ", " 28  Appendix 2 \nfor the replication of the zonal approach being tested and demonstrated by the ADB-supported \nDili Urban Water Supply Sector Project. The Project will cover only six subzones spread \naround three of Dili\u2019s 10 water supply zones\u2014covering about 26% of Dili customers (in addition \nto the approximately 10% of customers already adequately served). The sector investment \nprogram provides for the zonal approach to be replicated in the remaining Dili city water supply \nzones until the entire network is technically sound and properly managed. The approach would \nthen be replicated in Baucau and other urban centers in the remaining four priority districts.  \n \n2.  Context for the ADB Sector Grant \n14.  The draft WSS sector investment program 2008\u20132012 provides a proper context for an \nADB sector grant. The purpose of a sector loan or grant is to assist in developing a specific \nsector or subsector by financing a part of the investment planned by the Government. This type \nof ADB support takes a time slice or geographic slice of the wider investment program. The \nsector Project\u2019s water supply subzone approach fits with the usual subproject modality that \nunderpins a sectorwide investment program and ADB sector loan or grant.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  29\nPERFORMANCE OF NATIONAL DIRECTORATE FOR WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION \n \nA.  Agencies within the Urban Water Supply Sector \n1.  Ministerial Arrangements \n1.  Responsibilities of ministries and their line agencies in the water and related sectors were \nrestructured  on  8  August  2007.  Until  then,  the  National  Directorate  for  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation (DNSAS) was a line agency of the Ministry of Natural Resources, Minerals and Energy \nPolicy. In a major government reshuffle, the Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI) was created covering \nthe responsibilities of the Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of Transport and Communications, \nand the water supply, sanitation and electricity generation and distribution responsibilities of the \nMinistry of Natural Resources, Minerals and Energy Policy. Secretaries for state were created \nwithin MOI with the head of each secretary for state reporting to the minister. DNSAS reports to \nthe secretary of state responsible for water supply and sanitation, electricity, and urban planning. \n \n2.  Until September 2007, financial management, including procurement, was controlled by \nthe Ministry of Finance (MOF). This responsibility will be devolved to line ministries that have not \nyet been identified. Within MOI, financial, budgeting, and procurement responsibility will probably \nbe retained at the ministerial level, but it may be devolved to the respective secretaries of state. \nThe Ministry of State Administration controls staffing but is still developing its public service \nstaffing procedures for recruitment, motivation, appraisal, training, and discipline. A consolidated \nfund of Timor-Leste has been established. In accordance with government annual budget papers, \na  banking  and  payments  authority  makes  all  government  payments.  Treasury  receives  all \ngovernment revenues, acts as paymaster, and performs the accounting function of government.  \n \n2.  National Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation \n3.  DNSAS manages urban water supply systems in the 13 district capital towns\u2014the largest \nbeing Dili City with a population of approximately 165,000\u2014and a small but expanding number of \nsystems in smaller district centers. Due to resource constraints, its rural water supply activities \nhave relied heavily on the support of development partners and nongovernment organizations. \nThe Project will rely on DNSAS  as the project Implementing Agency, for day-to-day project \nimplementation. Project management will fit within existing DNSAS structures and will use existing \nsystems and processes. \n \n4.  DNSAS  organizational  development  is  discussed  in  greater  detail  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  B.  Although  established  with  a  strategic  plan  and  organization  structure  suited  to \nexpected early corporatization, DNSAS continues to operate as a government department. As \nexpected of a government directorate, DNSAS has limited autonomy in decision making other \nthan for basic operations and exhibits little accountability to service users. All financing, fees and \ncharges,  staffing,  infrastructure  development,  and  procurement  decisions  require  the  prior \napproval of higher level agencies. \n \n5.  DNSAS has 209 allocated staff positions, compared with 174 in 2005, and an urban water \nsupply infrastructure asset base estimated at almost $50 million. Its 2005\u20132006 total operating \nbudget\u2014covering urban water, urban sanitation, rural water, and sanitation\u2014was just under $2 \nmillion (up $0.6 million from 2004/05) with another $1.8 million for capital works (up $0.7 million). \nThe Government heavily subsidizes its operations and fully funds its development expenditures \n(in addition to external support). The 2006/07 staffing allocation for the various functions of \nDNSAS is shown in Table A3.  \n \n \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nTable A3: National Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation Staffing, 2006/07   \n  Permanent  Temporary  Total \nDivision  Staff  Staff  Staff \nAdministration and Human Resources a  8  4  12 \nDevelopment and Planning  23  10  33 \nDili Water and Sanitation Division b  47  21  68 \nDistricts Water and Sanitation Divisions  77  19  96 \n  Total   155  54  209 \na Includes customer services; staff administration, and finance.  \nb Temporary staff includes garbage collectors. \nSource: National Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation. \n \n6.

National Directorate for Water and Electricity Policy \n7.  The  recent  establishment  of  the  National  Directorate  for  Water  and  Electricity  Policy \nprovides an opportunity for the presently fragmented water supply sector policy and service \ndelivery directions to be reviewed, clarified, and comprehensively documented. The directorate\u2019s \nrole is to make policy and legislative recommendations to the Government, and coordinate and \nmonitor water service delivery.  \n  \nB.  Analysis of Organizational Strengths and Weaknesses \n1.  Strengths \n8.  DNSAS senior staff members exhibit a strong sense of organizational loyalty and pride. \nSenior managers meet weekly and organizational challenges are usually openly discussed and \n ", "  Appendix 3  31\ndecisions reached by concensus; although some autocratic and ad-hoc decisions occur at other \ntimes, often as a result of urgent ministerial direction. Senior staff members have a strong belief \nthat ongoing procedural changes will allow both MOI and DNSAS increased autonomy in human \nresource  management  and  more  rapid  ministerial-level  procurement  arrangements,  thus \nimproving organization performance. \n \n9.  Much reliance is placed on the well-documented organization structure and chains of \ncommand  are  well  understood.  Of  particular  significance  is  that  the  organizational  structure \ncurrently in place, was developed by DNSAS itself. While this structure is not completely in line \nwith recommendations,1 the structure is operational and workable. The sense of ownership of the \nstructure in place is strong. Job descriptions are available for most positions, but are not routinely \nreferred to or well-linked to operating procedures. No established system of formal performance \nappraisal is in place. \n \n10.  DNSAS staff members have demonstrated great acceptance of most new systems and \nprocedures imposed provided they have understood the need for change and the processes to be \nfollowed.  DNSAS  is  highly  regarded  as  more  capable  in  budget  preparation  and  quarterly \nreporting than most other agencies.  \n \n11.  With the assistance of the two ADB-managed trust funds for water supply and sanitation \nrehabilitation  projects  in  2001/02,  DNSAS  established  a  system  of  guidelines,  procedures, \nstandard specifications, and drawings for community water supply and sanitation and for urban \nwater supply. The community water supply guidelines have been well utilized and were recently \nupdated by DNSAS. These guidelines have been well promoted and accepted by development \npartners. They are viewed as good practice for similar activities in other countries. Urban technical \nguidelines and standards are discussed in Supplementary Appendix D. \n  \n2.  Weaknesses   \n12.  Organizational weaknesses perceived by staff all relate to lack of autonomy to perform \nprocurement, human resource management, and other functions that would allow them to do a \n\u201cbetter\u201d  job.  Examples  given  include  slow  procurement,  financially  constrained  emergency \nresponses, and inability to recruit budgeted staff. This is reinforced by the very poor DNSAS \nbudget execution,2 and underspending of staffing budgets. However ongoing changes concerning \nthe devolution of responsibility from MOF to MOI, and within MOI, may help, in part, to overcome \nthese weaknesses.  \n \n13.  Many  existing  organizational  deficiencies  are  not  recognized  by  DNSAS  staff  as \nweaknesses that need to be addressed. These include \n \n(i)  limited strategic planning;  \n(ii)  limited monitoring and reporting of performance; \n(iii)  few embedded systems and operating procedures;  \n(iv)  limited means to identify future infrastructure development, rehabilitation, operation \nand maintenance costs; and  \n(v)  lack of accountability to service users. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to Timor-Leste for Integrated Water Resource Management Project. Manila (TA \n3986-TIM).  \n2  The DNSAS 2004\u20132005 annual reports show an operating budget execution of 86%; however, when end of year \ncarryover commitments are removed the figure is 47%. Capital budget execution was similarly shown as 51%; \nhowever, actual capital expenditure at the end of the year was 0%. \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \n14.  DNSAS has experienced enormous organizational change over the past 6 years. Many \nstaff members have been rapidly promoted to positions with responsibilities far in excess of their \nprevious experience. Analytical thinking, planning, and problem-solving abilities have improved, \nbut the room for further improvement is significant.  \n   \n3.  Project Reaction to Strengths and Weaknesses \n15.  The Project will build on the identified DNSAS strengths and provide support in areas \nidentified as weaknesses. The Project will be implemented by DNSAS through its three existing \ndivisions. No special project management unit will be established and all technology transfer \nresulting from project implementation will benefit these three divisions. \n \n16.  The  Government  prefers  DNSAS  to  eventually  become  an  independent  public  entity \nexercising  management,  technical,  and  financial  economy.  To  this  end,  ADB  sought  the \nassurance of the Government and MOI, that by 31 December 2009, a draft ministerial order will \nbe submitted to the Council of Ministers setting out a road map for graduating DNSAS to that \nstatus. \n \n17.  Capacity building is integrated with project activities with all members of the team of \nimplementation consultants working collaboratively with their DNSAS counterpart(s). Further, a \npackage of technical assistance3 specifically aimed at enhancing DNSAS capacity has already \nbeen approved and will be in the field concurrent with the Project. \n \n18.  Exisiting comprehensive technical standards, drawings, specifications, and guidelines, with \nsome minor modifications, have been developed in consultation with DNSAS staff members. \nThese will be adopted as DNSAS documents and be followed by the Project. \n \nC.  Financial Management Assessment \n19.  A financial management assessment questionnaire and interviews were used to review the \npresent standing of financial management of DNSAS. The completed questionnaire and interview \nfindings are set out in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \n1.  Financial Management  \n20.  Supplementary  Appendix  K,  discusses  in  detail  DNSAS  financial  management  issues \nunder these headings: accounting, budgeting, and auditing. \n \n21.  During project implementation, the Project will need to develop accounting and reporting \nsystems4 to enable generation of suitable financial reports including total project expenditure \nincurred,  amount  eligible  for  ADB  financing,  amount  already  claimed  from  ADB,  amount \nreimbursed by ADB, and amount disallowed and/or pending for reimbursement.  \n \n22.  Detailed budgets are prepared by each unit and division of DNSAS and compiled by the \nfinance division. These are forwarded to MOI for approval and then finally to MOF. The overall \nbudget is approved by the Council of Ministers and finally by Parliament. Any changes to the \nbudget must be approved by Treasury, which can only authorize changes of plus or minus 15%.  \n \n23.  DNSAS  has  no  internal  audit  function.  Special  audits  of  DNSAS  projects  may  be \nundertaken by MOI or MOF, but this is not common. DNSAS is not required to have its own \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to Timor-Leste for Dili Water Supply Performance Improvement.

However, an international independent auditor audits the government accounts. The \nProject will need to arrange for an independent audit of project finances and transactions. \n \n2.  Conclusion  \n24.  The financial sustainability of the Dili urban water sector is dependent on (i) developing \nsubzone projects with improved water supply services; (ii) metering and billing households and \nnondomestic customers in the subzone project areas, and payment for improved water services; \n(iii) reducing water losses over the whole Dili water supply system; and (iv) billing all commercial \ncustomers. The physical intervention under the sector Project plus ongoing capacity development \nwill result in improved cost recovery and financial sustainability of the Dili urban water supply \nsystem. \n \n25.  In terms of financial management, DNSAS financial, accounting, and reporting systems \nare part of the overall government accounting system. DNSAS has limited financial autonomy. \nThe government accounting system provides adequate safeguards over the control and reporting \nof government expenditure against annual budget heads.  \n \n26.  However, in terms of project accounting and reporting, the Project will need to maintain \nseparate accounts and prepare separate financial statements. These will then need to be audited \nby an international accountant engaged by the Project.  \n \n ", "34   Appendix 4 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE WATER SUPPLY SECTOR \n \n1.  International donors active in the water supply sector and water resources in Timor-Leste \ninclude the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Australian Agency for International Development \n(AusAID), European Commission, French Cooperation, Japan International Cooperation Agency \n(JICA), New Zealand International Aid & Development Agency, Norwegian Water Resources and \nEnergy Directorate, Portugal Cooperation, United States Agency for International Development,  \nWorld Bank, various United Nations agencies, and World Health Organization. Most of these \npartners are only active in the rural areas of Timor-Leste and unless they have implications for the \nactivities of the Dili Urban Water Supply Sector Project are not discussed in this appendix. The \nGovernment of Portugal, through Aguas de Portugal Timor-Leste (Portugal Water Timor-Leste), \nand the German Technical Cooperation upgraded components of the water supply system in the \nsecond city, Baucau. \n \nA.  External Assistance with Implications for the Project \n1.  United Nations \n2.  The United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) established an \nOffice of Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) in 2001 as the government agency responsible for \ndeveloping,  managing,  operating,  and  maintaining  urban  and  rural  water  supply  systems \nthroughout Timor-Leste. The office also played a key coordination role with the activities of the \nmultidonor Trust Fund for East Timor. UNTAET formulated sector policies and a legal framework \n(Appendix 2). Phases I and II of the Water Supply and Rehabilitation Project were funded by the \ntrust fund and administered by ADB (paras. 4\u20135). \n \n2.  Australian Agency for International Development  \n3.  AusAid recently completed its Community Water Supply and Sanitation Project after 5 \nyears of implementation in Cova Lima, Bobonaro, and Viqueque districts. This project focused on \ninstalling small village and multivillage gravity-flow systems, and establishing community-based \nongoing management arrangements. A successor project, the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation \nProject commenced in September 2007, with AusAID committing $45 million equivalent over 10 \nyears. AusAID support includes capacity building for the National Directorate for Water Supply \nand Sanitation (DNSAS) and the Ministry of Health. The project implementation consultants, as \nwell  as  consultants  engaged  under  the  ADB  Dili  Water  Supply  Performance  Improvement \ntechnical assistance (TA),1 should coordinate closely with the Community Water Supply and \nSanitation Project.  \n \n3.  Asian Development Bank \n4.  The Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project, phase I operated from August \n2000 until December 2001.2 With a budget of $4.5 million, the project objective was to provide \nsustainable water supply and sanitation using appropriate technology. The scope was to restore \ndamaged water supply and sanitation infrastructure, and build institutional capacity to manage \nand operate the system. Among its outputs, the project produced many standards and standard \ndrawings, which DNSAS has adopted. These standards will be adopted and followed by the \nsector Project with some minor improvements to reduce the impact of intentional damage. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

The Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project, phase II operated from July 2001 \nuntil 30 April 2003.3 This project also had a budget of $4.5 million with objectives to improve the \ncapacity of water supply and sanitation services; and help implement priority projects in Dili, \ndistricts, subdistricts, and villages. \n \n6.  The  Integrated  Water  Resources  Management  TA  operated  from  March  2004  until \nFebruary 2006.4 It was to create a national water policy to lead to the adoption and progressive \nimplementation of an integrated approach to water resource management in Timor-Leste. A draft \nnational water resources policy was prepared and endorsed by the project steering committee and \nthe Prime Minister; however, the policy has yet to be formally adopted.  \n \n7.  The ongoing Infrastructure Sectors Capacity Development TA aims to improve the delivery \nof infrastructure services, including water supply, by providing training and logistical support to \nrelevant ministries.5 The Infrastructure Project Management TA supports project management of \nthe  Government\u2019s  own-funded  infrastructure  capital  program. 6  A  TA-funded  procurement \nspecialist will be available to assist the Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI) in undertaking procurement \nfor  the  Project.  TA-funded  safeguard  specialists  will  be  available  to  help  DNSAS  undertake \nenvironmental and social impact assessment and management for the Project. The Dili Water \nSupply Performance Improvement TA (footnote 1) is intended to directly support the Project. The \nTA will provide formal and informal training for (i) reduction of nonrevenue water, (ii) network \nmodeling and drawing office management, (iii) water meter management, (iv) customer service, \nand (v) distribution planning and management.  \n \n4.  Japan International Cooperation Agency \n8.  JICA  has  invested  heavily  in  urban  water  supply  infrastructure  and  has  a  program \ncontinuing in district towns. Total JICA investment in Dili is approximately $25 million equivalent. \nRecent  JICA  support  has  rehabilitated  or  replaced  headworks,  water  treatment  plants,  and \nreservoirs.  A  comprehensive  network  of  primary  and  secondary  water  mains  has  been \nconstructed throughout all 10 zones of the Dili water supply system. In many cases, these new \ngalvanized steel mains have yet to be connected to the existing network of mains, and tertiary \nmains serving neighborhoods do not exist. This JICA program in Dili has concluded.  \n \n9.  JICA also proposes a study on community-based integrated watershed management. The \nobjectives of this study are to develop a community-based watershed management plan for Laclo \nand Comoro river basins, both of which are in the Dili urban water supply catchment; and prepare \ncommunity-based watershed management guidelines for use in other areas. \n \n10.  JICA intends to conduct capacity development work within DNSAS aimed at improving the \nmanagement, operation, and maintenance of new water supply infrastructure. The assistance is \nlikely to target the operations of water treatment plants.    \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2001.

Lessons from Externally Supported Projects \n11.  Lesson from the ADB grant-funded Water Supply and Sanitation Project (phases I and II) \nas set out in the project completion report include \n \n(i)  significant external support to the sector is still needed; restoration of services to \npre-independence  standards  does  little  to  meet  goals  of  public  health,  human \ndignity, and environmental protection; \n(ii)  external assistance should fit within strategies of UNTAET WSS; the emergency \nphase  is  over  (December  2001)  and  long-term  planning  should  be  based  on \nassessment of needs; \n(iii)  sector assistance projects should be designed with sufficient flexibility to respond \nappropriately to evolving needs; \n(iv)  the need for capacity development at all levels is ongoing; however, this must be \nundertaken  at  an  appropriate  pace  and  timing\u2014some  previous  capacity \ndevelopment effort may need to be repeated for the benefit of new staff and for \nreinforcement of existing staff;  \n(v)  service can be improved rapidly and cost-effectively by  reducing water supply \ndistribution  system  leakage  and  customer  wastage;  the  introduction  of  cost \nrecovery based on a tariff structure will rapidly reduce consumer wastage; and \n(vi)  concentrating effort over a smaller area is more effective than spreading operations \ntoo thinly on the ground over a much wider area\u2014in this case, Dili and all district \ntowns. \n \n12.  The project performance audit report, produced by ADB in December 2004, identifies the \nfollowing lessons from the Water Supply and Sanitation Project (phases I and II): \n \n(i)  The community-managed model has not proved sustainable because it did not take \naccount of actual social relations, which are household and kin-based, rather than \ncommunity based. \n(ii)  The emphasis on delivering results to address an emergency situation meant that \naction took precedence over building local capacity, although the achievements in \nterms  of  capacity  development  within  the  Office  of  WSS  (now  DNSAS)  were \nsignificant. \n(iii)  The failure to reimpose charges for water at the time of rehabilitation of urban \nservices meant that doing so later became politically difficult given that the service \ndelivery standards had slipped in many instances.   \n \n13.  The major lessons from the Integrated Water Resources Management Project (footnote 4) \nwas that the capability of a nascent government can easily be overestimated. Project design \nshould ensure stakeholders fully understand the distinction between policy formulation and policy \nimplementation, and implementation support should be fully resourced. Awareness raising should \nbe continuous and appropriately resourced. Project design should capture synergy opportunities \namong  complementary  externally  supported  programs.  Legislation  and  formal  national  policy \nshould be drafted first in the Portuguese language.  \n \n ", " \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \nTable A5.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n($\u2019000) \n \n             \n  Foreign  Local      Total  % of Total \n Item  Exchange  Currency       Cost  Base Cost \nA.

The Dili Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project is consistent with the draft  \n2008-2012  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Investment  Program,  which  proposes  a \ncomprehensive program to turn-around the decline of urban water supply services in Timor-Leste. \nStarting with three zones within the Dili water supply service area, the program will demonstrate a \nzonal approach to progressively upgrading an entire city\u2019s water supply secondary and tertiary \ndistribution (reticulation) operation to sustainably decrease water losses, manage water demand, \nboost  customer  satisfaction,  and  improve  water  supply  business  performance.  Dili  city  was \nselected because it has the largest water and financial losses. If Dili remains such a drain on \nresources, the National Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation (DNSAS) will be unable to \ncommit sufficient resources to improve water supplies in other urban centers and rural areas.  \n \n2.  Dili city is divided into 10 geographic water supply zones. Three zones (2, 4, and 5) are \nselected for candidate subprojects. Subprojects have been selected in subzones within each of \nthese three water supply zones, Subzone boundaries will be determined by the technical location \nof the existing water supply pipe network, as well as the location of control valves. Subzones \nconsist of a discreet section within the water supply network where water flow can be controlled \nand managed. Each subzone, or subproject, will include approximately 1,000 water services. \n \n3.  While the technical reasons for the selection of subzones took precedence, consideration \nwas also given to the social and political implications of subzone sites and boundaries. Hydraulic \nboundaries cannot always be contiguous with suco (neighborhood administration) boundaries; the \nmanagement of water supply in a subzone will increase in difficulty as the number of sucos \nincreases. Similarly, if cost recovery, either in total or in part, is to be an output of the subproject, \nthen the socioeconomic status of the households within the subzone will be a key consideration. \nThe upgrading of subzones throughout the Dili water supply area is the ultimate aim of the sector \nProject. Issues of local political boundaries and socioeconomics affecting affordability and security \nmust be addressed.   \n \nA.    Procedures for Subproject Selection  \n4.  The Development and Planning Division of DNSAS will identify candidate subprojects that \nmeet the established criteria (paras. 6\u20138). The division will obtain DNSAS approval to assess the \nfeasibility of the candidate subprojects. DNSAS will then prepare a subproject appraisal report \n(SPAR) or feasibility study for each candidate subproject. SPAR will provide  \n \n(i)  technical analysis and description,  \n(ii)  subproject rationale,  \n(iii)  scope and components, \n(iv)  cost estimates and financing plan, \n(v)  implementation arrangements, \n(vi)  an initial environmental examination, and \n(vii)  a resettlement plan, as required. \n \n5.  DNSAS will submit each SPAR to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for review and \napproval on a no-objection basis. The SPAR will contain sufficient evidence of the candidate \nsubproject\u2019s eligibility under the agreed criteria and be prepared in accordance with the detail and \nquality required to enable ADB to assess the viability and suitability of the subproject. After ADB \nendorsement of the SPAR, DNSAS will submit the SPAR to the secretary of state of the Ministry \nof Infrastructure for review and approval. Implementation of the candidate subproject may only \n ", "46  Appendix 7 \nproceed following the endorsement of the SPAR by ADB, DNSAS, and Ministry of Infrastructure. \nThe subproject selection process is set out in Figure A7.  \n \nB.    Eligibility Criteria  \n6.  To  be  eligible  for  financing  through  the  Project,  subprojects  must  be  selected  in \naccordance with the following criteria: \n \n(i)  The subproject is consistent with the draft 2008\u20132012 Water Supply and Sanitation \nSector Investment Program and is identified by DNSAS as a high priority. \n(ii)  The  subproject  is  technically  feasible  and  meets  the  Government\u2019s  technical \nstandards and requirements. \n(iii)  The subproject is justified as the most feasible subproject to achieve the stated \nobjectives and is shown to be designed to minimize costs. \n(iv)  The subproject has no land acquisition or involuntary resettlement impacts. In the \nevent  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  is  unavoidable,  DNSAS  will  prepare  a \nresettlement plan in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) \nand the LARF.1 \n(v)  ADB determines that DNSAS has the necessary staff, and implementation and \nfinancial management capacity to implement the subproject, or that DNSAS can \nprovide specific assurances that assessed shortcomings can be rectified by adding \nqualified staff or by providing timely in-service training for existing staff. \n(vi)  The subproject\u2019s implementation time frame is reasonable, surveys and design can \nbe  prepared  and  reviewed,  and  safeguard  procedures  and  other  procedures \nfollowed with implementation to be completed within the project period. \n(vii)  The  financing  plan  clearly  identifies  confirmed  sources  of  financing,  including \ncounterpart  financing,  and  the  provision  of  budgetary  resources  to  meet \ncounterpart funding requirements for capital expenditure during implementation, \nenvironmental management costs, and routine operating costs. \n(viii)  The  subproject  will  not  adversely  impact  on  DNSAS  ability  to  meet  financial \ncovenants required by ADB. \n(ix)  All required government approvals have been obtained. \n \n7.  In  addition,  for  ADB  approval  the  subproject  must  meet  the  following  environmental \ncriteria: \n \n(i)  Subproject is not located in nature reserves. \n(ii)  Subproject does not involve any significant loss of primary forest, mangroves, or \nsensitive wetland. \n(iii)  Subproject  does  not  involve  any  permanent  negative  effect  on  known  rare  or \nendangered species. \n(iv)  Subproject does not involve any significant impacts on air quality and water quality.  \n(v)  Subproject does not involve any permanent damage to irreplaceable cultural relics \nand archaeological sites. \n(vi)  Subproject  does  not  require  a  preparation  of  the  full  environmental  impact \nassessment. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Note, however, that the project land acquisition and resettlement framework provides a mechanism to screen \ncandidate subprojects and\u2014if the need arises\u2014provide guidance on how to prepare and implement subsequent land \nacquisition and resettlement procedures. \n ", "  Appendix 7  47\n \n \nFigure A7: Flow Chart for Subproject Selection Procedures \n \n \n \n \n  Development and Planning \n  Division identifies candidate   \nsubproject and submits outline for   \n \nDNSAS approval   \n \nNo \n \n \nDNSAS endorses \n \npreparation of SPAR \n  for subproject?\n  Yes \n \n  DNSAS prepares SPAR and \n  submits to ADB for review and \napproval \n \n \n \n \n  No  ADB endorses SPAR? \n \n \n \nYes \n \n  DNSAS submits SPAR to MOI for \napproval \n \n \n \n  No \nMOI endorses SPAR? \n \n \n \n \n  Yes \n  DNSAS informs ADB of \n  Government endorsement for the \nsubproject \n \n \n \nDNSAS commences subproject \n  implementation. \n \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DNSAS = National Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation, MOI = Ministry of \nInfrastructure, SPAR = several subproject appraisal report.  \nSource: ADB. 2005.

Its outputs in six water supply subzones will be replicated \nprogressively throughout Dili, the second city, Bacau, and in other district centers. The Project\u2019s \nintended outputs are (i) water losses reduced and controlled in six subzones within Dili; (ii) visible \nleaks reduced and commercial and bulk customers metered in all 10 zones in Dili; and (iii) skills of \nNational Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation (DNSAS) technical and operations and \nmaintenance  staff  upgraded  in  leak  detection,  leak  reduction,  distribution  planning,  and \ndistribution management.

The economic and financial analyses of the proposed Dili Urban Water Supply Sector \nProject was carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects \n(1997) and Financial Management and Analysis of Projects (2005) of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB).  \n \nA.  Economic Analysis  \n1.  Project Rationale  \n2.  Many households with no piped connection rely entirely on water from dug wells or shallow \ntubewells and streams, which are often contaminated and pose serious health risks. Connected \nhouseholds receive an intermittent supply and often need to supplement their supplies with water \nfrom  neighbors  or  from  local  sources  such  as  wells  and  streams.  Overall  technical  and \nnontechnichal water losses are now estimated at 70% of water production. \n \n3.  The Project will complete the vertical integrity of the Dili water supply system in targeted \nzones, where subzone subproject areas have been selected. In these subzone areas, all leaks will \nbe repaired; tertiary reticulation refurbished, replaced, or installed; all households and businesses \nmetered; and 24-hour water supply with good pressure provided. Thus physical improvements \ntogether with improved system management and customer relations will achieve efficient delivery \nto regularized poor and nonpoor customers.   \n \n4.  Economic and health benefits will result from improved services. For this improved service, \ncustomers are expected to be willing to pay a tariff1 and will be billed accordingly. In addition for \nall zones, the Project will repair identified leaks, install valves and master meters, implement \nlogical improvements  to  the  pipe network,  and  meter  all  commercial  customers  who  will  be \nexpected to pay the water tariff.   \n \n2.  Economic Assumptions \n5.  For the present study, the following assumptions are adopted (i) all costs are expressed in \nmid-2007 prices; (ii) tertiary pipes and fittings are assumed to have a useful economic life of 30 \nyears after construction; (iii) the Project is analyzed over 22 years from 2008 to 2029, or 20 years \nafter  construction  with  residual  values  assumed  in  year  20  for  project  assets  of  10  years; \n(iv) meters are assumed to be replaced every 5 years at a cost of $30 every 5 years; (v) the real \nopportunity cost of capital employed in the economic analysis is 12%; (vi) capital costs include \nphysical contingencies, but exclude price contingencies (no financing charges are applicable as \nthe funds are provided as a grant); (vii) a standard conversion factor of 1.0 and a shadow wage \nrate of 0.50 are assumed; (viii) taxes and duties on imported pipes and fittings are 6.0% and sales \ntax 6.0%, a total of 12.0% on materials; (ix) water losses in the subzone subproject areas are \nassumed  at  25%  compared  with  70%  in  the  without-Project  situation;  (x) operation  and \nmaintenance costs for the subzone subprojects are assumed at 2.5% of project capital costs, plus \nadditional maintenance and clerical staff. \n \n3.  Least-Cost Analysis \n6.  The subzone subproject areas were selected using the given criteria with the main feature \nbeing to select areas where water supply was available and the system could be improved in \n                                                 \n1  In 2005, $32,000 revenue was collected for piped water sales from those billed and paying (2% of uses), and \nrepresented 2.6% of operating costs; in 2006, $58,000 collected represented 7.5%. \n \n ", "52  Appendix 10 \norder to demonstrate that customers would be willing to pay for an improved water supply. This \nmodel  is  to  be  progressively  replicated  in  the  Dili  area  and  in  district  towns  in  the  future. \nConsiderable  investment  has  been  made  in  water  sources,  water  treatment,  and  bulk \ntransmission  mains  in  Dili.  However,  unless  investment  in  the  tertiary  network,  customer \nconnections, and metering is undertaken, the benefits of this additional investment and water \nsupply  cannot  be  realized.  Accordingly,  investments  in  leak  reduction,  upgrading  tertiary \nconnections, and metering are necessary throughout the Dili urban area and in the subzone \nsubproject areas selected.  \n \n2.  Water Demand Projections \n7.  Demand projections for 2008\u20132020 in three subproject areas were prepared in line with \nADB guidelines, which relate demand to expected future increases in income and changes in \nwater price. Water demand forecasts are based on the estimated number of potential connections \nin 2007 multiplied by the estimated consumption, which is 70 liters per capita per day (lpcd) for \ndomestic  connections  and  1,000  lpd/connection  for  commercial  connections.  No  additional \ncustomers are assumed over the forecast period.2 The inclusion of both price and income effects \nresults in consumption increases in excess of the lifeline block of 70 lpcd. The conservative \nassumption adopted is that households take advantage of the lifeline block up to 70 lpcd or 14 \ncubic meters (m3) per month, while consumption above this may be met by existing nonpiped \nsources rather than an increase in piped water consumption.  \n \n3.  Economic Costs  \n8.  Capital costs are based on estimates of costs of rehabilitating the tertiary piped network \nand  household  connections,  plus  providing  connections  and  meters  under  the  Project  to  all \nunconnected households in the subproject areas. In addition, project management and detailed \ndesign are allocated to each subzone subproject. Adequate water supply is available in the \nwithout-project situation. Accordingly incremental operating costs for the subzone subprojects are \nassumed to be (i) operation and maintenance costs for maintaining pipes and connections at \n2.5% of project capital costs, (ii) replacement of meters every 5 years at a cost of $30 per meter, \n(iii) chlorination of all water at a cost of $0.0069/m3, and (iv) provision of additional caretaker or \nmaintenance staff and clerical staff.  \n \n4.  Project Benefits \n9.  Benefits are associated with (i) providing household connections (62.4% of households in \nproject zones) using nonpiped sources, (ii) improving water supply treatment and distribution by \nproviding  24-hour  service  in  areas  currently  experiencing  interrupted  service,  (iii)  increasing \nsecurity  of  supply,  (iv)  improving  drinking  water  quality,  (v)  improving  system  pressure,  and  \n(vi) reducing risk of exposure to waterborne pathogens. Decreased water losses will reduce \npumping costs, and chemical and operation and maintenance costs as less water production is \nrequired to meet water sales. Nondomestic water supply customers will benefit financially due to \nan improved supply without the need to resort to more costly tanker supplies. \n \n10.  The valuation of benefits is based on the water supply characteristics of each zone and \ninclude the following: \n                                                 \n2  Housing in Dili is relatively low density, but in the subproject areas chosen new or additional house construction on \nexisting sites is not anticipated. Regarding daily water consumption, surveys indicated that many households may \ncontinue to use wells for clothes washing and the like, so that overall consumption may not increase above levels \nproposed. However, there was a clear indication that such sources were not satisfactory and in case of hand pumps, \nphysically demanding, so that households preferred a piped connection. But some use of non-piped sources may \ncontinue. \n ", "  Appendix 10  53\n(i)  Time savings to collect water. Time taken in collecting a household\u2019s daily water \nrequirements was obtained as part of the socioeconomic survey, with an average \ndaily time of 90 minutes to collect an estimated 200 liters per household per day.  \n(ii)  Cost and maintenance of existing nonpiped facilities. Where households obtain \nwater from wells, both dug wells and tubewells (either with electric pumps or hand \npumps),  the  cost  of  providing  the  well,3 maintenance,  and  electricity  are  be \nincluded as part of the without-project costs. \n(iii)  Costs of storage. The cost of buckets and storage facilities in houses is included \nin the without-project water supply costs at $20 per household.  \n(iv)  Boiling  water.  Most households boil  water for drinking purposes (assumed at  \n5 lpcd) with these costs included in the without-project water supply costs.  \n(v)  Bottled  water.  Use  of  bottled  water  is  widespread  (representing  0.5%  of \nconsumption) with the average at 0.95 liters per household per day. This is valued \nconservatively at $53 per m3.  \n  \n11.  The cost of water consumption in the without-Project situation that is displaced by piped \nwater supply results in resource cost savings. The convenience of a piped water source results in \ngreater use of piped water than that in the without-Project situation. Also improved sanitation \npractices will lead to increased water use. This additional water consumption is incremental \nconsumption  induced by  piped  water  supplies  as  a  result  of  lower  costs  and  other  positive \nexternalities (such as improved hygiene practices and greater convenience) and is valued in \nterms of willingness to pay. The resource costs of water in the without-Project situation is an \nindication of the willingness to pay for the quantity of water consumed.  \n \n12.  The survey indicates the unskilled labor rate for casual labor at around $2.00 per day, with \na shadow wage rate factor of 0.50 assumed). Time savings combined with the cost of alternative \nwater sources results in a cost per m3 ranging from $2.2 to $2.8 per m3 to meet around 20 lpcd or \n$13.14\u2013$16.74 per month for 6 m3. In the project situation, households are assumed to take \nadvantage of the 70 lpcd available within the lifeline block and consume up to 14.0 m3/month; at a \ntariff of $0.20 per m3, this represents a cost of $2.8 per month. \n \n13.  The  present  situation  with  and  without  the  Project  provides  a  basis  for  deriving  a \nhousehold demand curve and estimating economic benefits of incremental consumption. Using \nthe semi-log function,4 the economic benefit to households is estimated as $1.06 to $1.31 per m3. \nIn the case of commercial customers, the cost of tankering water of around $1.00 per m3 is used \nas basis of benefit valuation. This level of benefit is used to value all household consumption \nwithout a piped connection, which represents approximately 60% of all domestic consumers in the \nsubzone. In the case of households with a piped connection, their hours of supply from the survey \nand whether the service was adequate were examined and a proportion of the economic benefit \nallocated to this consumption. Overall, this represents a further 6.9\u201310.3% of consumption valued \nat the  willingness to pay (WTP) value. \n \n14.  Economic benefits also arise from a reduction in water production requirements with the \nreduction in water losses in the subzone subproject areas from 70% to 25%. The reduction in \nwater production will result in savings in direct electricity pumping costs for both groundwater \n                                                 \n3  The capital cost of each water supply option is expressed as an annuity at 12% based on the expected life of the \nasset.  \n4 For derivation of the curve and benefit area under the curve, see Choynowski, Peter. 2002.

Calculation of the Economic Internal Rate of Return \n15.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the three subzone subprojects is 20.2% \n(Table A10.1). The EIRR of the Project exceeds 12%. The economic net present value at 12% is \n$1.336 million. The average incremental economic cost is $0.86 per m3. An analysis to test the \nsensitivity of the EIRR of the combined subzone subprojects to adverse changes in key variables \nwas  undertaken.  The  variables  tested  were  increases  (+10%)  in  capital  and  operation  and \nmaintenance costs,  reduction in subproject benefits (\u201310%), and a 2-year delay.  \n \n16.  The three pilot subprojects are most sensitive to a reduction in benefits, with the EIRR \nfalling to 18.8% (Table A10.1). However, where delays also result in real capital cost increases \n(20%) and a 2-year delay in benefits if the improvements are commissioned later, the EIRR \ndeclines to 13.4%. Accordingly, efforts must be made in subproject design to avoid such delays \nand cost increases. Where water losses in the subproject areas are only reduced to 40%, rather \nthan 25%, then the EIRR falls to 19.8%. \n \n17.  The calculation of benefits was also examined, and where the value of time savings were \nhalved from $2.00 per day to $1.00 per day (or alternatively the shadow wage rate factor SWRF of \n0.50 halved to 0.25), then the EIRR fell to 18.5%. Where the value of time was reduced to zero so \nthat the domestic WTP was based on the cost of nonpiped water sources, wells, pumps, cost of \nboiling water, etc., the EIRR falls to 16.8% suggesting the results are not sensitive to the value of \ntime adopted in the analysis. In the case of commercial customers, if their WTP based on tanker \ndeliveries at $1.00 per m3 was reduced to the current commercial tariff of $0.60 per m3, the EIRR \nfalls to 19.1%. If the last two sensitivities are combined, namely zero value of time used in cost of \ncollecting water in the case of domestic customers and commercial customers WTP based on \ncurrent tariff, then the EIRR falls to 15.7%. This indicates that the analysis is robust to the basis of \nbenefit calculation. \n \nTable A 10.1: Economic and Sensitivity Analyses for Three Subzone Sector Projects \nSensitivity Analyses  ENPV  EIRR  SI  SV \n      $'000  %  %  % \nBase Case  1,336   20.2       \n(i) Capital  +10%  1,135   18.  8.7  46.5 \n(ii) Operating  +10%  1,293   19.9  1.2  343.0 \n(iii) Benefits  \u201310%  958   18.0  10.8  (37.4) \n(iv) All the above  715   16.1       \n(v) Two-year delay  310   13.4       \n(vi) Water losses 40%  1,269   19.8     \n(vii) Reduce value of time by half  1,051   18.5     \n(viii) Reduce value of time to zero  765   16.8     \n(ix) Commercial WTP at tariff  1,144   19.1     \nEOCC        12.0       \n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, ENPV = economic net present value, EOCC = \neconomic opportunity cost of capital, SI = sensitivity indicator, SV = switching value , WTP = willingness to \npay. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.   \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 10  55\nB.  Financial Analysis  \n18.  Financial analysis was undertaken of the three subzone pilot subprojects of the sector \nProject.  Financial  benefits  result from  the  billing  and  payment  of  water  bills in the  subzone \nsubproject  areas  at  the  existing  tariff  (Appendix  11,  Table  A11.3)  for  domestic,  social,  and \ncommercial customers. Following the conflicts in 2006, all metering and billing of water customers \nwas suspended in April 2006 due to little incentive on the part of DNSAS to enforce payment from \na small proportion of the population.   \n \n19.  An optimistic revenue estimate, with the current declining water service, is for DNSAS to \nmaintain revenue at $50,000 per annum, with $20,000 more likely. Therefore, in the case of the \nsubzone subprojects an allowance has been made to reflect the fact that some revenues might \ncontinue to be paid. The initial three subzone subprojects represent about 13% of the population, \nbut possibly 25% of revenue potential as zones 2 and 5 have some commercial customers. \nTherefore, 25% of $50,000 or $12,500 is assumed over the three zones.  \n \n20.  An allowance is made for collection efficiency, that is, the amount of billed water charges \nactually collected, assuming 50% in the first year (2010) increasing to 90% by year 4 (2013). In \naddition, DNSAS would benefit from reduced water losses from 70% to 25%, and from savings in \nelectricity and chemical costs as a result of a reduction in both technical and nontechnical losses.  \n \n1.  Calculation of Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n21.  The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is estimated based on the opportunity cost \nto the Government of providing equity to the Project and adopting the same value for the ADB \ngrant funding. In the absence of any Government domestic bond market, the return on the \nGovernment's investments in the Petroleum Fund of Timor-Leste was taken as a proxy for the \nopportunity cost of capital. The Petroleum Fund will, in the future, be one of  the main sources of \nGovernment development financing. The average return on investments in 2006 in the fund of US \ntreasury bonds is estimated at around 5%. After adjusting for domestic inflation (4%), the WACC \nis 1.0% (Table A10.2). \n \nTable A10.2: Calculation of Weighted Average Cost of Capital  \nItem   ADB Grant  Government Equity  Total \nAmount ($ million)  6.00  1.50  7.50 \nWeighting  80.00  20.00  100.00 \nNominal Cost  5.00  5.00    \nInflation Rate  4.00  4.00    \nReal Cost   0.96  0.96    \nWeighted Component of WACC  0.77  0.19  1.00 \nADB =  Asian Development Bank , WACC =  weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n  3.  Results of Financial Analysis \n22.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the three subprojects is 2.5% for the pilot \nsubprojects, with benefits derived from revenues (at current tariffs) from water sales and savings \nin  chemical  and  electricity  costs  as  a  result  of  reduced  water  losses.  This  rate  compares \nfavourably with the estimated WACC at 1.0%, substantiating the financial viability of the Project. \nThe average incremental financial cost is $0.27 per m3 compared with average financial tariff of \n$0.25 per m3. The financial net present value at the WACC is $ 0.588 million.  \n \n ", "56  Appendix 10 \n23.  Separate analyses were carried out to examine the sensitivity of the FIRR and financial net \npresent value to adverse changes in key variables. The variables considered for the sensitivity \nanalyses are a 10% increase in capital costs, 10% increase in O&M costs,  10% decrease in \nbenefits, and 2-year implementation delay with a 20% increase in costs. The results are robust \nwith the standard sensitivities exceeding the WACC (Table A10.3). However, a project-specific \nsensitivity that reflects cost increases (20%) and a 2-year delay results in the FIRR declining to \n1.2%. Thus the Project is most sensitive to delays associated with corresponding cost increases. \nAccordingly, efforts must be made in project design to avoid delays and cost increases. A key \nobjective of the subzone projects is to reduce water losses. However, where water losses in the \nsubproject areas are only reduced to 40%, rather than 25%, then the EIRR falls to 1.9%. \n \n24.  Another project-specific sensitivity relates to collection efficiency. The analysis assumes \nthat a collection efficiency of 90% is achieved by year 4 of each subproject. This is considered \nachievable with the institutional and technichal support provided under the Project and associated \nprojects, plus expected household wiilingness to pay for the 24-hour provision of good pressure \nand clean water. The senstivity indicates that where collection efficiency falls to an average of \n80%,  then  the  FIRR  is  1.8%;  however  at  70%  collection  efficiency  the  FIRR  falls  to  1.1%. \nConsequently, at collection efficiencies less than 70%, the FIRR will be lower than the WACC. \nThe results are very sensitive to collection efficiency; every effort is needed, including adherence \nto disconnection policies, to ensure that more than 70% and preferably a collection efficiency of \n90% is achieved. \n \nTable A10.3: Financial Analysis and Sensitivity for Subzone Core Subprojects \n  FNPV  FIRR  SI  SV \nSensitivity Analyses      $'000  %  %  % \nBase Case  558   2.5       \n(i) Capital  +10%  370   1.9  23.7  25.7 \n(ii) Operating  +10%  437   2.1  12.9  47.1 \n(iii) Benefits  \u201310%  193   1.5  39.4  (15.5) \n(iv) All the above  (116)   0.7       \n(v) Two-year delay  125   1.2       \n(vi) Water losses 40%  333   1.9     \n(vii) Collection efficiency 80%  319   1.8     \n(viii) Collection efficiency 70%  64   1.1     \nWACC        1.0       \n( ) = negative value, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, FNPV = financial net present value, SI = \nsensitivity indicator, SV = switching value, WACC = weighted average cost of capital.                        . \nSource: ADB. 2005.

As a government department, the National Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation \n(DNSAS) has limited autonomy in decision making other than for basic operating matters. All \nfinancing,  fees  and  charges,  staffing,  infrastructure  development,  and  procurement  decisions \nrequire the prior approval of the Ministry of Infrastructure, Ministry of Finance (MOF), or Ministry of \nState Administration.  \n \n2.  The annual budgets for DNSAS activities for the 3 years, FY2005\u2013FY2007, and actual \nexpenditure are summarized in Table A11.1, with actual annual expenditure and percentage of \nthe  budget  spent.  DNSAS  has  underspent  its  budget,  especially  capital  expenditure,  where \nactivities have been constrained by unrest during recent years. Thus in FY2007 only 75% of the \nbudget was spent, an improvement over the previous year\u2019s 64%. In FY2006, additional capital \nexpenditure  was  provided\u2014Emergency  Response  Facility  of  $0.769  million  and  capital \ndevelopment of $1.00 million, with 43% and 77% of these amounts spent, respectively. \n \nTable A11.1: Budget and Actual Expenditure ($\u2019000) \n   Budgeted  Actual Expenditure  Percentage Spent (%) \nItem   2005  2006  2007  2005  2006  2007  2005  2006  2007 \nSalary and Wages  258.0  263.0  324.4  180.0  222.4  274.7  70  85  85 \nOperating Expenses  934.0  1531.0  1674.4  834.1  1122.4  1409.9  89  73  84 \nMinor Capital a  152.0  200.0  347.3  145.5  178.4  140.9  96  89  41 \nCapital Development  \u2014  560.0  1790.0  \u2014  103.0  1264.8  \u2014  18  71 \nTotal Budget  1344.0  2554.0  4136.0  1159.5  1626.3  3090.3  86  64  75 \n\u2014 =   not available.          . \na Includes minor equipment and treated as material maintenance expense. \nSource: National Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation.  \n \nB.  Dili Water Supply Operating Costs \n3.  Estimates of annual operating costs for Dili water supply operations for the 3 years, 2005, \n2006, and 2007, averaged $1.055 million (Table A11.2). In FY2007, Dili accounted for about 81% \nof the DNSAS operating budget. If sanitation services are added to the total, then Dili represents \nabout 74% of DNSAS\u2019s overall operating budget. Operation and maintenance materials and \nequipment make up the largest item of expenditure at $0.516 million (47%) and include materials \nrequired  for  leak  repairs,  maintenance  of  water  treatment  plants,  contractor  payments,  etc.; \nfollowed by electricity and fuel (22%); other operating expenses (including internally displaced \npersons camps) 15%; and staff costs of 10%. \n \nC.  Water Tariffs and Revenue Generation \n4.  In  February  2004,  the  Council  of  Ministers  approved  the  current  tariff  structure,  with \ncharges levied for each cubic meter consumed on a monthly basis, for Dili urban area and district \ntowns (Table A11.3). The initial block in the domestic tariff allows for a lifeline of around 70 liters \nper capita per day, assuming about 6.9 persons per occupied dwelling.  \n ", "58  Appendix 11 \n \nTable A11.2: Estimate of Costs of Dili Water Supply Operations  \n(Year ended 30 June, $\u2019000) \n(%) \nItem  2005  2006  2007  2007 \nStaff costs   114  112  105  10 \nO&M materials and equipment   573  362  516  47 \nElectricity and fuel   298  208  241  22 \nVehicle operating and fuel  38  51  59  5 \nOther operating expenses  190  99  177  16 \nOffice expenses  8  7  7  1 \n  Subtotal  1,221  838  1,104  100 \nSanitation (solid waste)  308  250  254   \n  Total  1,529  1,088  1,358   \nO&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: National Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable A11.3: Current Urban Water Supply Tariffs \nMonthly Water Tariff  Consumption Band /  Dili  District \nCategory  m3 per month  $/m3  $/m3 \nDomestic (piped)  0\u201314.0   0.20  0.20 \n  >14.0  0.40  0.40 \nPublic taps  All  0.10  0.10 \nSocial ( school, hospital, mosque, church)  All  0.15  0.15 \nCommercial/Industrial  All  0.60  0.60 \nm3 = cubic meters. \nNotes:   Domestic = premises principally used for long-term residential accommodation (Hotels and boarding \nhouses where a fee is paid for use of the accommodation on a commercial basis are categorized as \ncommercial).

Charging for water through tariffs commenced in November 2004, but by March 2006 only \n24% of DNSAS registered customers in Dili were metered and billed for water, and only 2% of \ncustomers actually paid their water bills. With the disturbances in April 2006, all billing of Dili \ncustomers ceased. DNSAS revenue generation is set out in Table A11.4 and shows that in \nFY2005 water billing revenues accounted for $32,400 (39% of revenues) and in FY2006 water \nbilling revenues increased to $58,000 (55% of total revenues). In 2006, revenues of $105,300 \nrepresented about 12.6% of the Dili water supply operating costs, with water tariffs representing \n7.0%.  \n \n6.  The 2004 decree also provided charges for water connections for Dili and districts, with \nthose  for  the  districts  lower  in  recognition  of  lower  incomes  and  the  need  to  encourage \nconnections. Domestic customers may pay 50% upfront and the balance in installments over the \nfollowing  12  months.  All  other  customer  classes,  including  social,  are  required  to  pay  the \nconnection fee upfront. The project estimate is $192.2 for a 15 mm diameter connection, while the \nDNSAS  cost  would  be  $153.30  (where  households  undertake  their  own  excavation  and \nbackfilling) compared with $55 per domestic connection charge. This indicates a considerable \nsubsidy in the cost when providing a water connection at these charges.  \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 11  59\nTable A11.4: Revenue Generation (12 months ended 30 June, $\u2019000) \nItem  2005 a  2006 a  2007 \nWater Billing (Dili)  32.4  58.0  \u2014 \nWater Tankers DNSAS  9.0  5.9   \nWater Tankers Private  22.8  10.7   \nConnections (Dili)  18.8  30.6   \nTotal  83.0  105.3  45.9 \nDNSAS =  National Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation. \na Billing commenced in November 2004 and was discontinued in April 2006.  \nSource: National Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation. \n \nD.  Timor-Leste Tariff Policy and International Best Practice \n7.  The key water supply policy directives for urban water supply prepared between 2000 and \n20031 included in the main legislation2 are (i) the Government will provide a \u201cuniversal water \ndistribution service;\u201d (ii) DNSAS will provide \u201cappropriate, secure and sustainable\u201d urban water \nsupplies in the \u201ccapital city and chief towns of each district and subdistrict;\u201d (iii) in the long term, \nthe \u201ctotality\u201d of water service costs incurred will be recovered from service users; and (iv) an urban \nwater services fees policy will be established to promote sustainable water use and will consider \nthe  overall  economic  situation,  the  needs  of  the  poor,  and  the  coverage  of  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) costs. \n \n8.  In particular, Water Services Tariff Policy (Section 17) of Decree Law 2004/4 requires tariff \npolicy to be developed that takes into account the following factors: (i) sustainable use of the \nwater resources of East Timor, (ii) economic circumstances of East Timor, (iii) need to provide a \nminimum of water to the poor people of East Timor; and (iv) paying for the costs of operating and \nmaintaining  the  water  supply  system.  The  Water  Law  also  provides  for  disconnection  and \nreconnection policies (Section 15) for nonpayment of water tariffs, connection fees, or interfering \nwith and/or damaging a connection. However, to date such regulations have not been enforced \nand enforcement capacity has generally been lacking. \n \n9.  These  may  be  compared  with  tariff  policies  and  objectives  developed  related  to \ninternational best practice. These objectives3 are of particular importance in developing water tariff \nstructures and levels for Dili, namely (i) financial sustainability and cost recovery, (ii) economic \nefficiency, (iii) price equity, (iv) administrative efficiency and good governance, and (v) affordability \nand universal access. The Water Services Decree Law 4/2004 overall tariff policy objectives are in \naccord with international best practice (Supplementary Appendix K). \n \n10.  An estimate of the capital and operating costs for Dili was used to assess tariffs to meet \nO&M4 costs,  O&M  plus  depreciation,5 and  a  5%  return  on  net  fixed  assets.  Assuming  the \npostproject reduction in water losses at 25% (compared with 70% now) and a collection efficiency \nof 90% (compared with less than 10% when billing ceased in April 2006), a tariff of $0.19 per m3 \nwould be required to cover O&M costs, $0.40 per m3  to cover O&M plus depreciation; and $0.56 \nper m3 to achieve a 5% rate of return.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The water supply legislation framework was developed with external assistance in 2001. \n2  Decree-Law 2004/4 was approved in 2004 \n3  ADB. 2006.

This analysis of operating costs suggests that the present tariff structure covers cash O&M \ncosts in the initial domestic block ($0.20 per m3) while the commercial and industrial tariff at $0.60 \nper m3 would recover O&M costs, plus depreciation and a 5% return on assets. In the case of the \nsocial category of customers, the current tariff of $0.15 per m3 would not cover cash O&M costs, \nhowever, social customers are expected to represent 1.25% of customers. The average tariff in \nthe subzone areas is $0.25 per m3 meaning that overall O&M costs are recovered with cross \nsubsidy from commercial and industrial to the domestic and social customer categories. \n \n12.  In view of the current economic situation in Dili, the current tariff structure is recommended \nto be adopted in the subzone subprojects. With a reduction in water losses to 25% (and a \ncollection efficiency of 90%), this tariff structure would recover operating costs, which is the \nfinancial objective of current water tariff policy of the Public Water Supply Decree. In addition, \nwater connections are to be free for households participating in the subprojects as an incentive to \nparticipate. This is seen as equitable where exiting customers with damaged connections and \nmeters would have these replaced under the Project. The project capital costs provide for new \nconnections  as  well  as  replacement  items.  The  objective  is  to  instill  a  payment  for  service \nphilosophy in customers in the subzone areas. Tariffs can be adjusted in the future as economic \ncircumstances improve and household incomes in Dili increase. \n \nE.  Financial Impact of the Project on DNSAS Dili Operations \n13.  The objective is to have Dili water supply providing a 24-hour service by 2014 with good \npressure treated water, with all customers metered and charged a tariff. This would allow water \nproduction to be measured in terms of metered sales. Prior to this, where only those domestic and \nsocial customers within the subzone subprojects were metered, and commercial customers in all \nzones, domestic water use could not be limited so that there would be wastage, with production \nassumed at maximum for the system, rather than that required to meet metered sales (and \nlosses). Consequently by 2014, when all customers are metered and billed, production would be \nrelated to sales and average water losses of 35%.  \n \n14.  As limited information is available on DNSAS district operations, projections of DNSAS \noperations  were  prepared  for  Dili  only.  As  Treasury  operates  on  a  cash  accounting  basis, \ndepreciation was excluded. No balance sheet information is available with all DNSAS accounting \nundertaken by Treasury with DNSAS allocated all operating and capital requirements through the \nstate budget. Projections of revenues and expenditures were prepared (in constant 2007 prices) \nfor 2008\u20132020 with the objective of achieving coverage of operating costs through the tariff by \n2017. Forecasts of water demand are based on population projections for Dili assuming a 5% per \nannum  population  growth  rate,  with  revenue  projections  based  on  metering  and  billing  all \ncustomers in subzone subprojects and all commercial customers throughout Dili. A collection \nefficiency of 50% in the first year rising to 90% after 4 years is assumed for DNSAS revenue \ngeneration. \n \n  1.  Capital Expenditure  \n15.  Table A11.5 summarizes capital expenditure under the Project and ongoing expenditure \nover the forecast period. Projected capital expenditure totals $17.1 million during 2008\u20132020 (in \n2007 prices). The Project will provide $7.5 million during 2008\u20132010 with an estimated $9.60 \nmillion required for the remainder of the period.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 11  61\n16.  In the future, DNSAS is to receive $2.0 million per annum for capital expenditure from the \nstate budget, which would cover some of the balance.6 A second subzone improvement project is \nassumed to commence in 2010, while upgrading the whole network would also continue. This \nmay involve an overall project cost of $5.0 million, which may require external funding assistance \nwhere  DNSAS  has  available  from  the  state  budget  about  $1.0  million  for  Dili  per  annum. \nThereafter, during 2013\u20132020, DNSAS should be able to fund capital expenditure out of its state \nbudget allocation, as it would be less than $1.0 million per annum, and new connections have an \nelement of cost recovery (20%). \n \nTable A11.5: Estimated Capital Expenditure Dili Water Supply  \n(FY ended 30 June, $\u2019000) \nItem  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016  2017  2018  2019  2020 \nSubzone sector  \n   projects                                        \nADB Year 1  \n(3 zones)  1,477.1  369.3                       \nADB Year 1  \n(3 zones)    1,284.0  321.0                     \nNew Year 3  \n(3 zones)      1,284.0  321.0                   \nNew Year 4  \n(3 zones)        1,284.0  321.0                 \nMetering  \n   domestic  55.7  55.7      609.9  602.9  174.5  184.5  456.7  494.1  534.1  576.8   \nAll zones  \n   improvements  1,266.9  316.7  500.0  500.0                   \nDetailed design  540.5  540.5  270.2  100.0  50.0  50.0               \nEquipment and  \n   miscellaneous  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0 \nWater  \n   production                      150.0  100.0   \nTotal Capital   \n   Grants  3,440.1  2,666.1  2,475.2  2,305.0  1,573.9  1,252.9  274.5  284.5  586.7  594.1  784.1  776.8  100.0 \nNote: All figures are calculated in 2007 prices. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n  2.  Results of Financial Projections   \n17.  Over the whole Dili water supply service area (compared with subzones) with increased \noperating costs to provide improved services, the existing tariff revenues would only meet 80% of \noperating costs in 2017 and 90% by 2020. Real tariff7 increases of 29% in 2014 to cover operating \nshortfalls by 2017 are set out in Table A11.6. The largest increase (65%) is proposed in the social \ncategory to bring the tariff into line with the lifeline domestic category, followed by commercial \n(50%), with the domestic lifeline increased by 25% to $0.25 per m3, and then above 14 m3 per \nmonth by 25% to $0.50 per m3.8 The tariff for public taps would remain at the present tariff. The \nprovision of lifeline block and public taps should be adequate protection for the poor. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6  Although this amount is to cover all other DNSAS projects in Timor-Leste district towns etc., if 50% were allocated to \nDili from 2010 to 2020, this would amount to $11.0 million, which would be adequate. \n7  Any actual tariff adjustments would need to take into account any inflationary increases in costs during 2008\u20132014. \n8  Were the tariff structure is also to be revised, then the lifeline block should be reduced from 14 m3 to 10 m3 per \nmonth, a second block of 10 m3 to 20 m3 per month at $0.50 per m3 included, with all consumption above 20.0 m3 per \nmonth charged at the commercial rate of $0.90 per m3. In addition, churches and mosques and other social \nnonrevenue generating activities should be included in a tariff category with the same structure as domestic.

Household Affordability of Water Tariffs \n19.  An affordability analysis reviewed the impact of the proposed tariff changes discussed. \nThis analysis assumes that in 2015, an average household (with an income of $192 per month as \nper the socioeconomic survey) consumes 120 liters per capita per day or 25 m3 per month and a \nlow-income  household  (with  an  average  income  for  the  lowest  quartile  of  $92  per  month) \nconsumes 68 liters per capita per day or 14 m3 per month. The revised water tariff results in a \nmonthly charge for 25 m3 of $8.9 per month in 2015 compared with $7.1 per month with the \ncurrent tariff, representing 3.7% of average household income, which is similar to the current tariff, \nwhere incomes grow at 3.75% per annum.10 In the case of a low-income household, the monthly \ncharge is now $3.5 per month compared with $2.8 per month, which represents 3.2% of income \nfor a low (bottom quartile) income household compared with 3.0% under the current tariff, where \nincomes grow at 2.5% per annum. At these levels, current water tariffs are regarded as affordable, \nand below the 4\u20135% affordability threshold. \n \n                                                 \n9  This assumes any impact on consumption due to real price increases. However, income elasticity of demand effects \nover the period would probably mean that increases in consumption would offset any price elasticity of demand \neffects related to the tariff increase. \n10  Assuming real increase in gross domestic product of 5.0% per annum over the forecast period. \n ", "  Appendix 12  63\nSUMMARY OF LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \n1.  The due diligence undertaken for the three core subprojects appraised show no land \nacquisition or involuntary resettlement impacts. Due diligence to be undertaken for candidate \nsubprojects should show there to be no land acquisition or involuntary resettlement impacts, and \nthe Project\u2019s agreed subproject selection criteria preclude any candidate subproject that would \nrequire land acquisition or involuntary resettlement. However, since the Project uses a sector \nmodality,  a  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Framework  (LARF)  has  been  prepared  in \naccordance with the ADB Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and Operations Manual Section \nF2/IBP on involuntary resettlement (2006). The LARF will be available to guide later Government-\nfunded  urban  water  supply  improvements  in  Dili  and  other  centers.  The  LARF  provides  a \nmechanism to screen candidate subprojects and\u2013if the need arises\u2014provide guidance on how to \nprepare and implement subsequent land acquisition and resettlement procedures (LARP). This \nAppendix summarizes the full LARF contained in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n2.  Land ownership issues in Timor-Leste are clouded by inadequate legal and regulation \nframework resulting in insecure land and property rights.1 The principles and policies on land \nacquisition and compensation under this LARF are therefore based on the ADB policy. \n \n3.  Notwithstanding the ineligibility under the Project of candidate subprojects with possible land \nacquisition or resettlement requirements, subproject implementation will comply with the agreed \npolicy  principles  contained  in  paragraph  9  of  Supplementary  Appendix  G,  and  with  due \nconsideration of the customs and traditions of the people in the subproject site. For any subproject \nwith possible resettlement impacts, DNSAS will carry out (or commission consultants to carry out) \na social impact assessment, based on preliminary technical designs. The LARP will also include \nmeasures to ensure that socioeconomic conditions, needs, and priorities of vulnerable groups are \nidentified, and ensure that land acquisition and resettlement does not disadvantage them.  \n \n4.  Subproject screening is used to identify the types and nature of potential impacts related to \nthe activities proposed under the Project, and to provide adequate measures to address these \nimpacts which ensure that potential affected persons are (i) informed of their options and rights; \n(ii) included in the consultation and participation in the selection of alternatives; and (iii) provided \nwith prompt and effective compensation at full replacement cost for losses of land, assets and \naccess to assets and livelihoods attributable to the subproject(s). The screening process will be \ncompleted by the project implementation team and be reviewed and cleared by ADB.  \n \n5.  The  detailed  measurement  survey  will  be  used  to  identify  eligible  households  and \nindividuals, and the cut-off date associated with it (the end of the survey), is used to discourage \nany party to take advantage of the compensation measures as people moving into the area or \nstarting to use resources after the cut-off date are not eligible for compensation and livelihood \nrestoration.  The  entitlements  of  eligible  households  and  individuals  are  summarized  in  the \nentitlement matrix below. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 World Bank.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nTimor-Leste is one of the poorest nations in the world. The Government has a clearly defined strategy for poverty reduction, \nwhich includes improvement of basic social services to poor households and enhancement of national and local institutional \ncapacities. The Dili Urban Water Supply Sector Project will result in leak reduction and improved pipe networks across the \nwhole of Dili city, and intensive water supply improvement in six subzone subprojects. At the same time, capacity of staff of the \nNational Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation (DNSAS) to manage and sustain the water system will be enhanced, so \nthat gains made during the Project can be sustained and extended in the future. Thus the Project focus reflects two of the key \nareas of the Government\u2019s national poverty reduction strategy.  \n \nThe combination of technical improvements and enhancement of staff capacity will enable DNSAS to provide Dili with an \neconomically more efficient water system and thus release some of the resources that DNSAS is currently forced to commit to \nthe provision of urban water services, enabling these resources to be used to improve services in rural areas, where more than \n40% of people are estimated to live in poverty. The reduction in water-related illnesses anticipated to result from an improved \nwater system in Dili should also result in savings to the national health situation, which currently supplies free medical treatment \nto Dili residents.   \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nUrban water supply can be linked to poverty in Timor-Leste in a number of ways: (i) poor infrastructure is a barrier to local \neconomic development and hence can limit job creation in a situation where unemployment is very high and growing annually; \n(ii) high urban water costs detract from the provision of water to rural areas, further limiting development; (iii) excessive \nleakages can lead to stagnant water that can attract malarial and dengue mosquitoes, thus increasing the risk of mosquito-\nborne illnesses, the occurrence of which can impact on both household productivity and national health costs; (iv) the time taken \nto access water for domestic use can be an added burden on households, especially for women; and (v) limited access to safe \nwater can increase the risk of waterborne diseases and reduce hygiene, potentially reducing household productivity.  \n \nThe Project will directly or indirectly impact on each of these links to poverty. The entire population of Dili city will receive an \nimproved water supply with a major reduction in leakages. This should, in turn, result in a significant reduction in the risk of \nmosquito-transmitted diseases. The consequences of this reduction of leakages will directly affect some 160,000 people in Dili, \nof whom in 2004 more than 14% are estimated to have been living below the national poverty line of $0.55 per day. As a result \nof the lower incidence of disease, income earners will have fewer days lost from work due to illness, a consequence of illness \nthat usually disproportionately affects poorer households.  \n \nThe Project\u2019s subprojects will result in additional improvements in the water supply in the six subproject areas. The subprojects \nare not located in the poorest water zones in Dili; in the September 2007 socioeconomic survey 27% of households interviewed \nhad a per capita income below the national poverty line ($15.44 per month). About 4,000 residents live in each of the subproject \nareas. For many of these residents, these additional improvements in water supply will bring benefits in terms of added \nconvenience and reduced costs. A total of 64% of those interviewed did not have a DNSAS water connection and had primary \nsources of water ranging from private bore wells with electric or hand pumps, to shallow wells with buckets, all of which to a \nvarying extent are subject to contamination. For the 64% of households surveyed that did not have a piped water service at their \nhome, the median time that members as a whole spent on collecting water from their primary source was 90 minutes per day. In \naddition, approximately 25% of the households interviewed, including 31% of those with a DNSAS household connection, had \nto supplement their primary source of water with a secondary source. In some cases this could take up to 2 hours per day. Apart \nfrom the opportunity costs, the direct costs incurred in obtaining water from sources other than a DNSAS connection can include \n(i) cost of drilling a shallow well ($100 or more), (ii) cost of either an electric pump (around $250 and lasting 10 years) or hand \npump ($45 and lasting 6 years), (iii) cost of repairs and maintenance to the pump and well, and (iv) cost of purchasing bottled \nwater (purchased by 42% of households) at a median cost of between $0.50 and $1.00 per day depending on the location.    \n \nThe combined effect of improved quality of water in the pipe network, increased number of DNSAS household connections, and \nelimination of the need to supplement piped water with water from potentially contaminated sources will result in reduced risks \nof both water-washed and waterborne diseases, as well as mosquito-borne diseases, in the subproject areas. This is likely to \ndisproportionately benefit the lower per capita income households. The survey results indicate that members of households with \nper capita incomes below the national poverty line were more likely to have experienced one or more days of illnesses that they \n ", "68  Appendix 13 \nattributed to water-related causes than those whose incomes were $1.00 per day or more (78% compared to 53%). In addition, \ncivil works required to improve the network and to connect households to the system and install meters will provide an \nestimated 300 local residents with income-generating opportunities.  \n \nBecause of the close link between Timor-Leste\u2019s National Development Plan and its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \nthe Project will directly or indirectly assist Timor-Leste meet a number of its MDGs, including the goals of (i) ensuring that 86% \nof the urban population have access to safe drinking water by 2015; (ii) reducing the percentage of people earning less than $1 \nper day from 21% in 2001 to 14% by 2015, and (iii) reducing the mortality rate among children under 5 by two thirds between \n1990 and 2015 (not only does a poor water supply directly contribute to the risk of a number of illnesses, but in situations where \nit results in recurrent bouts of diarrhoea it can lead to malnutrition in children, making them more vulnerable to other illnesses.)  \n2. Design Features.  \nThe Project does not have any features directly targeting poverty reduction. However, to maximize its potential benefits to poor \nhouseholds, the Project will collaborate with other agencies to promote responsible community water-use behavior. Such \nbehavior will contribute to cost savings and the prevention of waterborne and mosquito-carried diseases. These factors will \nmotivate behavioral change.  \n \nContractors carrying out construction work will be required to employ people from the suco (neighborhood) in which they are \nworking for unskilled laboring jobs. This will include a disproportionately large number of people from the lowest income \nhouseholds.  \n \nThe existing tariff structure has a lifeline component to ensure that households with per capita incomes below the national \npoverty line will be able to continue to afford sufficient DNSAS piped water for consumption and personal hygiene when \nhouseholds are required to pay water tariffs. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \nThe Project is funded by an Asian Development Fund Grant and poverty impact analysis for policy-based lending is not required.\nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nA major concern for the Project will be overcoming the current community attitudes to basic social services; attitudes that \nevolved in Dili during conflict and civil unrest. Dili residents have not been regularly paying for water for some years and have \nnot been invoiced since April 2006. When meters were still being read, meter tampering occurred, and now breaking pipes for \nwater or making illegal connections, especially to the connections of houses that have been destroyed by fire, is common. Theft \nof, and damage to, network system components is the norm and rarely are direct penalties imposed for such behavior. This \nsituation is in part a consequence of household problems with the supply of DNSAS water and the consequent difficulties that \nresidents face in accessing water for household use. Connections to a reliable and safe supply of water will facilitate behavioral \nchange, especially if project implementation activities are carefully sequenced to ensure that no one currently obtaining water \nillegally is ever left without a source of safe water while improvements are being made to the network. However, the Project will \nalso have a detailed strategy for promoting behavioral change concurrent with improvements being made to the local network \nsystem (Section E). This strategy will involve collaboration with other agencies such as the United Nations Development Fund \nfor Women; the Alola Foundation (a nongovernment organization); PLAN International; and the women\u2019s organization, the \nOrganizacao Popular Mulher Timor, which is linked to the suco councils. These linkages will mainstream the promotion of \nresponsible water use behavior in the ongoing activities of these agencies and in schools. Such activities will need to involve \nsustained advocacy of appropriate behavior over an extended period. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \nThe consultation process in project preparation included a household socioeconomic survey of 300 households in water supply \nzones in which the subprojects will be implemented, formal and informal meetings with suco chiefs and with women and youth \nmembers  of  the  suco  councils,  and  relevant  government  departments  and  nongovernment  organizations  working  with \ncommunities in Dili. A program of focus group meetings on specific issues of relevance to involving communities in the long-\nterm sustainability of the Dili city water system was also carried out. This is discussed in detail in Supplementary Appendix H. \nDuring this consultation process, some issues essential to project design were discussed, such as (i) role of subzone \ncaretakers; (ii) approaches to promote responsible water use behavior; and (iii) strategies to reduce the incidence of illegal \nbehavior affecting the piped water system. Other issues such as the type of facilities (communal taps, tanks, etc.) to be provided \nfor households with no direct access to streets, did not produce a response, despite probing; specifically affected households \nwill need to be given the opportunity to comment during project implementation, once proposals have been developed. The \nissues on which consultation has taken place and requiring community consultation in the course of project implementation are \nindicated in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 13  69\n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during project implementation and monitoring?  \n (cid:55) Information sharing       (cid:55)  Consultation      (cid:55)  Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \nThree types of community consultation and participation will be required during project implementation: \n(i)  A complaints system and process for regularly assessing consumer satisfaction and accurately monitoring complaints \nwill need to be established. Although critical to the success of project implementation, these processes will need to be \nestablished  as  permanent  ongoing  elements  in  DNSAS  management  of  the  water  system.  Accordingly  these \nprocesses will be developed under the community and customer relations program of the associated Dili Water Supply \nPerformance Improvement technical assistance project, which will support DNSAS improvements in community and \ncustomer relations including feedback mechanisms. \n(ii)  Community consultation will be required in relation to certain aspects of the project design as implementation \nproceeds, such as the arrangements for bill paying and provision of water for houses without direct street access. For \nthe most part, community involvement in such decisions will require information sharing and consultation. These \nissues, and the appropriate consultation and community participation when addressing them, are discussed in \nSupplementary Appendix H.  \n(iii)  Project success will depend on the commitment of local communities to the conservation of treated water and the \nwater infrastructure, and the ultimate willingness of households to pay for the water they consume. Given the existing \ncontext, achieving this commitment will require sustained community-based advocacy of the behavior necessary for \neffective functioning of the system. This will require the active collaboration of the Project with suco (small suburb) and \naldeia (neighborhood) council members and other groups in the community. To achieve this community involvement, \nthe Project will also collaborate with other agencies in Dili (e.g., United Nations, the Alola Foundation, etc) who are \ndoing community mobilization work in Dili aldeias, with a view to these agencies adopting supportive strategies. \nPreliminary discussions with relevant agencies and with the national women\u2019s organization (OPMT) at the aldeia level \nhave led to interest in such collaboration. Similarly women in some aldeia have expressed interest in participating in \nsuch activities. Peer education opportunity, as one option, is discussed in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \nOpportunity for the Project providing schools with extracurricular classroom resource material in the form of a booklet of games \nand other activities relating to the effective use of water as well as the need for conservation is also discussed in Supplementary \nAppendix H. \n \n3.  Was a consultation and participation plan prepared?    No \n  \nCommunity consultation and participation is an important aspect of project design and implementation. The C&P process for \nproject design is elaborated above and C&P arrangements during Project implementation will be detailed in the subproject \nappraisal reports and become an important component of successful subproject implementation. \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \nData from the socioeconomic survey is gender disaggregated and has been analyzed accordingly. Information on the gender \ndivision of labor with respect to relevant household activities such as decisions about utility connections and payment of utility \nbills, collection of water, pumping, and filtering and boiling water, shows that most water-related tasks are shared by both men \nand women. However, because of their disproportionate responsibilities for housekeeping and child-care, women are most \naffected by the convenience of the water source available to them,   \n \nVirtually no difference was noted in the willingness of male and female respondents to pay at least $2.00 a month for piped \nwater (73% and 71% respectively) when willingness to pay was considered in terms of whether or not the respondent was the \nhousehold member solely or equally responsible for managing money for the payment for utilities. In households headed by \nmen, a slightly lower percentage of those responsible for managing money were willing to pay (68%), compared with those not \nresponsible (77%). Women respondents who were responsible solely or partly for managing money for utilities were somewhat \nless willing to pay (65%) than were men in this position (70%). (The number of households headed by women was too small to \ndo a similar comparison for that group). Nonetheless, a clear majority of both men and women are willing to pay.  \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making processes: \n    Gender plan           Other actions/measures      (cid:55)  No action/measure \n \nNo gender action plan will be required for the Project.  \n \nHowever because of the significance of their role as water users, women should be primarily responsible for any program \ndesigned to promote good water use behavior; particular attention should be paid to women\u2019s groups in the community \nfacilitating such promotion. Women will be the primary target for any such community-based promotion activities. Among \nhouseholds using public facilities, girls will also be a target group for such promotion, as they are observed to often be \nresponsible for clothes washing, etc. at the public water facilities.     \n \n \n \n ", "70  Appendix 13 \nIII.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION \nAre social indicators included in the design and monitoring framework to facilitate monitoring of social development activities \nand/or social impacts during project implementation?  Yes  \n \n ", "  Appendix 14  71\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \n1.  This  summary  initial  environmental  examination  outlines  the  findings  of  the  initial \nenvironmental examinations (IEEs) of the three core subprojects of the Dili Urban Water Supply \nSector  Project.  The  IEEs  are  presented  as  Supplementary  Appendix  I.  The  IEEs  of  core \nsubprojects are closely linked to the requirements and procedures of the Government\u2019s draft law \non environmental impact assessment. Government responsibility for urban environmental issues \nlies  with  the  secretary  of  state  for  environment  (SSE)  within  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and \nDevelopment.  The  environmental  assessment  process  followed  the  draft  law  and  is  in \naccordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  the \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  Under  the  ADB  assessment  guidelines,  the \nProject is categorized as an environment category B. IEEs were prepared for core subprojects in \naccordance  with  the  ADB  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  and  comply  with  ADB \nEnvironment Policy.   \n \nA.  Description of the Project \n2.  Starting  with  three  zones  within  the  Dili  water  supply  service  area,  the  Project  will \ndemonstrate a zonal approach to progressively upgrading an entire city\u2019s water supply secondary \nand tertiary distribution (reticulation) operation to sustainably decrease water losses, manage \nwater demand, boost customer satisfaction, and improve water supply business performance. Dili \ncity is divided into 10 geographic water supply zones. Subprojects were selected in subzones \nwithin each of the three target water supply zones in the Dili water supply service area. Subzone \nboundaries were determined by the technical location of the existing water supply pipe network, \nas well as the location of control valves. Each subzone includes approximately 1,000 water \nservices. \n \nB.  Description of the Environment \n3.  Timor-Leste occupies the eastern half of the island of Timor, the most easterly island of \nthe Lesser Sunda Group. It is approximately 300 kilometers (km) long and 50 km wide with a total \nland area of 15,000 square kilometers. It is mountainous with peaks up to 2,920 meters (m) and \nis bordered by coral reefs. The urban area of Dili is located on a flat strip of land between the \ncoast line and the foot of the mountains. The Project and subprojects are all located entirely on \nthis coastal strip of flat land. The climate is monsoonal with distinct rainy and dry periods. Rainfall \nis relatively high (over 1,750 millimeters) on 65% of the island; much of this rain falls in heavy \nstorms during the months from December to March. Average temperature at sea level is 27oC \nand sea level relative humidity is around 80%. Timor-Leste has a combination of Australian and \nAsian flora and fauna, with about 224 species of birds, 23 of which are endemic to the Timor \nisland group. Timor-Leste also has rich marine life. Threatened or endangered species include \nseveral turtle species and estuarine crocodiles.  \n \n4.  Timor-Leste  is  one  of  the  least  developed  countries  in  the  world.  Per  capita  gross \ndomestic product (non-oil) was estimated at $370 in 2006, and has fallen in most years since \n2001. Around 40% of the total population is reported to live under the official income poverty line \nof $0.55 per capita per day. Each year, about 14,000 young people enter the labor force. Youth \nunemployment increased nationally from 15% in 2001 to 23% in 2004; and underemployment \nmay be three times as high. Timor-Leste\u2019s human development index remains the lowest among \nSoutheast Asian countries and Timor-Leste ranks 140th (value of 0.426 in 2004) of 177 countries \nranked worldwide. The Project is wholly within the urban area of Dili city and provides water \nservices  to  industrial,  commercial,  and  residential  premises.  Dili  had  a  2006  population  of \n ", "72   Appendix 14 \n160,000. Each subproject includes approximately 1,000 water connections and has a population \nof about 4,000 permanent residents.  \n \nC.  Forecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n5.  Each subproject will systematically repair, refurbish, or replace tertiary distribution pipe \nnetworks;  and  replace  or  install  water  meters  in  an  effort  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  both \nnonrevenue water and unaccounted-for-water. All work will be undertaken on the same alignment \nof existing water pipes and services. The potential environmental impacts associated with the \nwork in the subproject will occur during implementation, and will typically involve excavation and \nexposure of existing water pipes accompanied by local stockpiling of excavated material prior to \nbackfilling the excavation. Expected negative environmental impacts will be limited to (i) possible \nnoise and dust pollution while work is in progress; (ii) possible broken water pipes; and (iii) \npresence of open excavations while work is in progress. Positive environmental impacts will \ninclude the repair of leaks in water pipes resulting in an expected substantial reduction of pooling \nwater within the urban area. Since the natural terrestrial environment of the subproject area has \nalready been significantly altered and disturbed by urban development with roads, drains, homes, \nand industrial and commercial buildings, the subproject will not cause any significant impact to \nthe existing environment, nor will it affect any environmentally significant area. Implementation \nwork of the subproject will not affect any streams or watercourses within the Dili urban area. No \nmajor sites of archaeological, cultural, or historic significance will be affected by subproject \nimplementation. All excavations will be undertaken in ground that has been subject to previous \nrecent excavation. All asbestos cement pipes to be disconnected by the Project will be left in-\nground and covered. As all subproject activities will be undertaken on the footprint of existing \nwater supply infrastructure, no land acquisition or land for resettlement will be required. The \nenvironmental impacts identified for preimplementation, implementation, and operations phases \nfor the subproject are detailed in this appendix. They are also shown in the environmental \nmanagement and monitoring plan (EMMP) matrix set out in Supplementary Appendix I. The \nEMMP addresses the impacts and mitigation measures identified, and outlines the requirements \nof various people or agencies that need to be addressed during the phases of the subproject. \n \nD.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n6.  The  Government\u2019s  draft  law  on  environmental  impact  assessment  has  yet  to  be \npromulgated by the Council of Ministers. While the requirements of the draft law are clear, they \nare not well enforced. These provide for the preparation of an IEE, and all urban development \nprojects will require SSE approval. SSE may require a full environmental impact assessment for \nsubprojects with significant negative environmental impacts. The National Directorate for Water \nSupply and Sanitation (DNSAS) will need to submit an application for approval to SSE for each \nsubproject. A subproject appraisal report (SPAR) will be prepared for each subproject and will \ninclude an IEE prepared following ADB requirements. Approval applications for subprojects will \nbe supported by a SPAR. \n \n7.  An environmental and social unit (ESU) will be established within the Administration and \nHuman Resources Division of DNSAS. The ESU will comprise two staff who will be responsible \nfor environmental management; and public and customer relations. DNSAS will be responsible \nfor  the  preparation  of  subproject  IEEs  including  an  EMMP.  The  IEE  will  be  reviewed  and \napproved  by  SSE  and  ADB.  SSE  will  determine  if  an environmental  impact  assessment is \nrequired according to the requirements of the draft law (although subproject screening criteria will \nexclude subprojects that may have significant negative environmental impact, according to ADB \ncriteria). Prior to the commencement of implementation activities, and once detailed design \ninformation is available, the EMMP developed for the subproject will be refined by the ESU. The \n ", "  Appendix 14  73\nESU will assist other sections DNSAS in supervising EMMP implementation through regular \nobservation and spot-checks of implementation activities. The ESU will help DNSAS ensure that \nEMMPs are adequately prepared and will ensure that adequate and timely remedial actions are \ntaken when issues arise during implementation. \n \n8.  During all phases of subproject implementation, management of the EMMP will be the \nresponsibility of DNSAS with overall site monitoring of the subproject the responsibility of the \nESU. Monitoring will include regular community meetings to monitor community concerns, thus \nidentifying  and  mitigating  these  concerns  as  early  as  possible  in  the  process  to  ensure \ncommunity actions do not prevent access or incur damage to the subproject site. DNSAS will \nprepare  quarterly  mitigation  progress  and  monitoring  reports.  At  the  end  of  subproject \nimplementation, the ESU will prepare a summary report and verification that mitigation actions \nwere completed and forwarded it to SSE with a copy to ADB.  \n \nE.   Public Consultation and Disclosure \n9.  DNSAS  will  provide  public  notification  of  the  subproject  in  a  widely  circulated  local \nnewspaper in both Tetum and Portuguese languages. Notifications will invite submissions from \nmembers of the public, or organizations within the community within 2 weeks following public \nnotification. Notification will advise that further information may be obtained at the office of SSE \nor DNSAS. Public consultation and information disclosure requirements are detailed in the IEE \n(Supplementary Appendix I). \n \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n10.  The  Project  through  the  implementation  of  subprojects  will  improve  technical  and \ncommercial water losses in three of the city\u2019s water supply zones. Lessons can then be applied to \nsimilar programs in adjacent zones and progressively replicated until all 10 of the city\u2019s water \nsupply zones are covered and overall service delivery is improved. The Project, through the \nimplementation of subprojects, will assist the Government to achieve its Millennium Development \nGoal and National Development Plan targets for urban water supply. The Project will have few \nnegative impacts and all can be satisfactorily managed. The EMMP establishes compliance \nconditions. DNSAS will ensure that mitigation measures are included in subproject design while \nduring implementation the ESU will have monitoring responsibilities. The Project will include \nstrengthening of DNSAS by establishing and supporting the ESU.   \n \nG.  Environmental Assessment Review Procedure \n1.  Environmental Selection Criteria for Subprojects \n11.  In selecting subprojects, the following criteria will be used for the first level of screening. If \nany of these criteria are found applicable to the particular subproject and/or other conditions that \nmay lead to a full environmental impact assessment, the subproject will not be accepted as part \nof the sector Project: \n \n(i)  subprojects located in nature reserves; \n(ii)  any significant loss of primary forest, mangroves, or sensitive wetland; \n(iii)  any permanent negative effect on known rare or endangered species; \n  and significant impacts on air quality and water quality; and \n(iv)  any permanent damage to irreplaceable cultural relics and archaeological sites. \n \n12.  The  IEE  process  to  be  applied  will  confirm  this  or  recommend  necessary  work.  All \nsubprojects will be subject to an IEE to be prepared by the ESU. The IEE of subprojects will \n ", "74   Appendix 14 \ninitially  be  prepared  under  the  supervision  and  guidance  of  the  project  implementation \nconsultants. \n \n2.  Review  Procedure  for  Environmental  Assessment  of  Subprojects  and \nResponsibilities of DNSAS and ADB \n13.  To ensure that all subprojects are prepared in accordance with the ADB Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines  and  the  Government\u2019s  draft  law,  DNSAS  and  ADB  will  divide \nresponsibilities.  \n \na.  DNSAS Responsibilities \n14.  DNSAS through the ESU will be responsible for the following: \n(i)  prepare an IEE for each subproject for approval by the SSE; \n(ii)  undertake adequate consultation with affected people and public disclosure; \n(iii)  undertake the necessary actions to ensure environmental compliance with the \nrequirements of the Government and ADB; \n(iv)  obtain the necessary IEE clearance (development consent approval) from SSE; \n(v)  submit to ADB, IEEs and their summaries, incorporating EMMPs; \n(vi)  submit  to  ADB  the  development  consent  approval  from  the  SSE,  and  its \nconditions, for ADB consideration in approving the subprojects; \n(vii)  ensure that the EMMP required mitigation measures to be incorporated during \npreconstruction activities are addressed by the design section within DNSAS; \n(viii)  ensure that the EMMP implementation stage mitigation measures are included in \nregulatory clearances (particularly the development consent approvals) will be \nobtained before commencing any civil work for the subproject; \n(ix)  ensure that the completed EMMP is submitted to SSE for approval; \n(x)  ensure  that  all  DNSAS  sections  understand  their  responsibilities  to  mitigate \nenvironmental problems associated with implementation activities; \n(xi)  monitor the EMMP and ensure it is properly implemented; and \n(xii)  submit quarterly progress reports of on the implementation of EMMPs to the SSE \nand ADB. \n \nb.  ADB Responsibilities \n15.  ADB will be responsible for the following: \n(i)  review IEE and summary initial environmental examination reports and disclose \nthe reports through the ADB website; \n(ii)  review all statutory environmental clearance granted by the SSE, particularly the \ndevelopment  consent  approval,  and  note  all  conditions  in  approving  the \nsubprojects; \n(iii)  review the quarterly report of EMMP implementation and take necessary actions in \nclose consultation with DNSAS; and \n(iv)  undertake monitoring of EMMP implementation and due diligence as part of the \noverall project review mission. \n \n3.  Environmental  Due  Diligence  to  Ensure  Compliance  with  the  ADB \nEnvironment Policy \n16.  DNSAS  should  ensure  that  ADB  is  given  access  to  undertake  environmental  due \ndiligence  for  all  subprojects,  if  necessary.  However,  DNSAS  has  primary  responsibility  for \nundertaking  environmental  due  diligence  for  monitoring  implementation  of  environmental \n ", "  Appendix 14  75\nmitigation for subprojects. The due diligence report and monitoring report of the implementation \nof the EMMP need to be systematically documented. \n \n4.  Public Disclosure \n17.  For any subproject subject to the environmental assessment and review procedure and \nwhere an IEE is required, formal and documented public consultation and information disclosure \nwill be required. This will be done once during IEE preparation, i.e., to inform stakeholders of \nproject components and to encourage input to identify overlooked environmental issues. The \ninformation disclosed and feedback provided at the consultation sessions will be summarized, \nattendance recorded, and the document attached as an annex to the IEE. Invited attendees at \nIEE  consultations  will  include  Government  agencies  and  local  authorities,  community \nrepresentatives, as well as nongovernment organizations. At least 2 weeks notice of consultative \nmeetings will be given. DNSAS is responsible for ensuring that all documentation including the \nenvironmental due diligence and monitoring reports are properly and systematically kept as part \nof the DNSAS project record. Environmental documents such as IEEs are subject to public \ndisclosure and therefore should be made available to the public on request. \n \nH.  Conclusions \n18.  The Project is classified as category B. All impacts can be satisfactorily mitigated and an \nEMMP  was  prepared  that  contains  practical  and  realizable  mitigation  measures.  The  IEE \nconcludes that the subproject will not have a significant impact on the environment. The IEE \nconcludes that adverse environmental impacts arising from the location, design, implementation, \nand operation and maintenance of the proposed water supply and delivery infrastructure can be \nminimized  to  insignificant  levels.  Therefore  a  full  environmental  impact  assessment  is  not \nconsidered to be warranted. An EMMP is provided in Supplementary Appendix I and will be \nstrictly adhered to. \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20080114111643+08'00'", "Author": "Administrator", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word", "Keywords": "rrp: tim 38189, president reports recommendations, dili urban water supply, dili water sector", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20080114155622+08'00'", "Company": "Licenced User", "Title": "Dili Urban Water Supply Sector Project"}, "author_page": " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \nThe unit of currency in Timor-Leste is in US dollar. \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  AusAID  \u2013  Australian Agency for International Development \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  BME  \u2013  benefit monitoring and evaluation \n  COM  \u2013  Council of Ministers \n  DNSAS  \u2013  National Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation \n  EARP  \u2013  environmental assessment and review procedure \n  EIRR  \u2013  economic internal rate of return \n  EMMP  \u2013  environmental management and monitoring plan \n  ESU  \u2013  environmental and social unit \n  FIRR  \u2013  financial internal rate of return \n  IBNet  --  International Benchmarking Network (water supply utilities) \n  IEE  \u2013  initial environmental examination \n  JICA  \u2013  Japan International Cooperation Agency \n  LARF  \u2013  land acquisition and resettlement framework \n  m3  \u2013  cubic meter \n  MDG  \u2013  Millennium Development Goal \n  MOF  \u2013  Ministry of Finance \n  MOI  --  Ministry of Infrastructure \n  NDP  \u2013  national development plan \n  NGO  \u2013  nongovernment organization \n  NRW  \u2013  nonrevenue water \n  O&M  \u2013  operation and maintenance \n  SPAR  \u2013  several subproject appraisal report \n  SSE  \u2013  secretary of state for environment \n  WACC  \u2013  weighted average cost of capital \n  WSS  \u2013  water supply and sanitation \n \nNOTES \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government starts 1 January and ends 31 December. \n(ii)  In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n \nVice President  C.
