The Government \nconfirmed its interest in obtaining TA to prepare a comprehensive database on poverty of the six \nprovinces around Tonle Sap Lake (the project area). The TA was subsequently proposed to the \nPoverty Reduction Cooperation Fund (PRF) at the donors\u2019 meeting in December 2002, during \nwhich funding was endorsed.1 The Fact-Finding Mission2 visited Cambodia from 12 September \nto 1 October 2003. Understandings were reached with Government on the TA goals, purpose, \nscope, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for \nconsultant services (Appendix 1).  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.   Tonle Sap is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia, covering 250,000 to 300,000 \nhectares (ha) during the dry season. Owing to a unique hydrological phenomenon, the Tonle \nSap River, which drains the lake, reverses its flow during the wet season, when the Mekong \nRiver flows into the lake, inundating 1.0 million\u20131.6 million ha for several months of the year. \nThe extensive wetlands born of this cycle are home to an enormous biodiversity of fish, reptile, \nbird, mammal, and plant species. The lake supports one of the richest capture fisheries in the \nworld. Tonle Sap directly and indirectly meets the livelihood needs of at least 15% of the total \npopulation, and nutrition-related needs of about 80%, particularly the poor. The richness of its \nresources makes the Tonle Sap a site of growing conflict, often violent. Growing population \npressure, inequality of access to resources and confusion of rights, severe poverty, and ethnic \ndiscrimination place the lake, and the people it supports, at risk.  \n \n3.  In  1993  a  royal  decree  designated  Tonle  Sap  as  a  multiple-use  protected  area. \nInternational attention paid to the lake has been growing. In 2001 United Nations Educational, \nScientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) declared it a biosphere reserve in recognition of \nits international and national significance.3 The Government recognized the need to manage the \nlake\u2019s environment in a sustainable way. The poverty reduction partnership agreement between \nthe Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) identifies the lake as the focus of \nADB\u2019s poverty reduction efforts on account of its environmental significance as well as critical \nrole in environmental conservation and management, and poverty reduction.4 Despite their rich \nresource base, the six provinces around the lake have fairly high poverty levels5 and are home \nto most of those who depend on the lake for survival. The project area is bounded by Highways \n5 and 6. The Country Strategy and Program Update (CSPU) (2004-2006) lays down a basic \napproach to poverty reduction around the lake. ADB has launched the Tonle Sap strategy, \n                                                 \n1  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities on 15 October 2003.  \n2  The Mission was composed of M. Mitra, mission leader; and V. Pen, local consultant. P. van Im,  senior program \nofficer,  Cambodia  Resident  Mission  (CARM),  assisted  the  Mission.  It  held  participatory  national  and  local \nworkshops, with wide stakeholder participation. Discussions were held with communities living on and around \nTonle Sap. \n3  Under UNESCO\u2019s Man and the Biosphere Program. \n4  The provinces around Tonle Sap are among the poorest, with 40-60% (in some areas, around 80%) of the \npopulation living on less than a dollar a day. Female-headed households, which make up 11-30% of all households \nin these provinces, are particularly vulnerable to poverty. Children\u2019s enrollment rates are well below the national \naverage. Adult literacy rates are low. \n5  Population figures as follows: Siem Reap, 694,485; Battambong, 795,958; Pursat, 360,291; Kompong Chhnang, \n416,999; Kompong Thom, 568,454; and Banteay Meanchay, 577,300. The most vulnerable people are those living \non Tonle Sap in floating communities and in its lowland areas, making up 25% of the 1.2 million people living in the \narea bounded by Highways 5 and 6. Fishers and farmers cannot be distinguished, and most people are both. ", "2  \nwhich sets out a plan for ADB\u2019s partnering with the Government, nongovernment organization \n(NGOs),  and  communities,  to  support  pro-poor  economic  growth,  access  to  assets,  and \nmanagement of natural resources and the environment. The strategy\u2019s first step is to develop a \nreliable knowledge base on sustainable use and preservation of natural resources, the nature of \npoverty, and ways to reduce poverty in a sustainable manner.  \n \n4.  Gender inequality and social exclusion based on ethnicity are major challenges for \npoverty reduction and social development,6 and around Tonle Sap in particular. Women head \nup to 25% of all households and tend to be vulnerable on account of lack of adult labor, high \nrates of dependency, lack of education, lack of livelihood options, dual workloads, and limited \ndecision-making  opportunities.  Ethnic  minorities,  including  Vietnamese  born  and  living  in \nCambodia and, to a lesser extent, the Khmer Islam or Cham, lack equal access to resources, \nstructures, and processes, as well as opportunities to improve their livelihoods. Ethnicity is \nimportant to understanding poverty and its multiple causes and dimensions.  \n \n5.  The strategy should remedy the serious dearth of knowledge on specific aspects of \npoverty and vulnerability around Tonle Sap. Participatory poverty research allows people to be \nheard on urgent issues and, thus, influence policymakers.  \n \n6.  While quantitative estimations of poverty are being carried out through economic and \nsocial surveys (and work by the poverty monitoring analysis technical unit [PMATU]),7 the \nquality and comparability of data collected have been questioned. The National Institute of \nStatistics (NIS) is implementing the household socioeconomic survey (2003-2004), which will \nprovide much-needed statistical information about living standards and the extent of poverty. A \nrange of demographic and socioeconomic information will be collected, including household \ncharacteristics and composition, income and expenditure, education and literacy, health and \nnutrition, crime and safety, labor force, and consumer prices. An intercensal survey will be \nconducted in 2004, and a national health survey is planned for 2005.  \n \n7.  Besides  quantitative  data,  the  Government  and  external  funding  agencies  have \nemphasized  the  need  for  qualitative  data  gathering  and  analysis.  In  Cambodia,  the  first \nparticipatory poverty assessment (PPA) was undertaken in 2000 with ADB assistance to inform \nthe poverty reduction policies emanating from the Second Socio-Economic Plan (SEDP II). The \nGovernment  and  donors  as  well  as  civil  society  emphasize  the  need  to  further  deepen \nparticipatory research of poverty. ADB and other donors, including the World Bank, have thus \ncome together to work with the Government to undertake the next generation of PPAs, which \nare likely to be region specific. The consensus among the Government and all its development \npartners is that a common methodological framework be developed for this PPA. The Tonle Sap \nPPA will be closely linked with the work of National Institute of Statistics (NIS) and the PMATU. \nEnd users of TA outputs include the Government; donors, particularly the World Bank; NGOs; \n                                                 \n6  Cambodia\u2019s population in 2001 was 13.1 million: 52% were women, 80% of whom lived in rural areas. Households \nheaded by women constitute approximately 25% of all households and are poorer and more vulnerable to \neconomic shocks and loss of resources than others. Men are increasingly migrating to other employment, leaving \nagriculture to women. Women provide most of the labor for agriculture and rural economic activities. Despite high \nlevels of economic participation, women work largely as unpaid family labor on farms and in enterprises. Poor \neducational levels of women limit their paid work opportunities. Women are losing out in access to land on account \nof  land  allocation  practices.  Female-headed  households  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  indebtedness  and \nimpoverishment. Domestic violence is emerging as a symptom and a cause of women\u2019s vulnerability and poverty \n7  Multipurpose socioeconomic surveys have been conducted in Cambodia since 1993. While these are useful to \nconstruct a national poverty line and monitor poverty, lack of comparability between the different surveys creates \nproblems for consistency of poverty monitoring over time (Knowles, J.C. 1998. An Updated Poverty Profile of \nCambodia. Cambodia.) ", "  3\nprovincial and local governments; and local communities. Opportunities and spaces for local \ncommunities must be created so they can be heard. The TA is a step in that direction. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n8.  This is an advisory technical assistance (ADTA). The goal of the TA is to help build an \nauthoritative knowledge base on poverty in the project area. The objective is to develop a micro-\nlevel perspective of poor peoples\u2019 experiences with poverty, and responses to it, illuminating the \nnature of poverty and vulnerability, impacts of macro policies, local institutions, and processes \nthat either include or exclude the poor\u2014men, women, children, and ethnic minorities\u2014from \ndevelopment. The study is expected to help develop sustainable poverty reduction strategies \nbased on policymakers\u2019 improved understanding of what the poor need. The outputs will consist \nof (i) a synthesis of all studies of poverty in the region as well as reports and documents that \nhave used participatory and qualitative methods to assess the perceptions of the poor; (ii) a \ncomprehensive participatory and qualitative report on perspectives of the poor on poverty in the \nTonle  Sap  basin;  (iii) a  handbook  on  methodology;  (iv)  commune  reports  and  audiovisual \nmaterials in Khmer for easy access and use by commune councils in local planning; (v) reports \nof workshops; (vi) TA outputs for the Tonle Sap web site; and (vii) a published report. The TA \nwill also help prioritize and design future ADB projects. The framework summarizing the TA \ngoal, purpose, outputs, activities, and inputs is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology8 and Key Activities \n9.  The TA aims to examine, from the viewpoint of the poor, dimensions and causes of \npoverty and vulnerability; the nature of livelihoods and assets; connectivity between different \nsets of livelihoods; access to common property resources; the role of markets for goods and \nservices,  including  fisheries,  agricultural  commodities,  and  labor;  and  production  support, \nincluding  credit,  information,  food,  and  other  consumables.  The  TA  will  be  based  on \nparticipatory and qualitative fieldwork methods that have been developed to enable poor people, \nwomen, and other vulnerable groups to define, describe, analyze, and express their perceptions \nregarding the study topics, including local dynamics and the development paradigm developed \nby Robert Chambers, among others.9 Within this paradigm, the poor come first and know more \nabout  their  environments  than  outsiders.  Livelihood  improvement  has  to  start  with \nunderstanding the multiple aspects of livelihood assets, structures, and processes that underpin \nsuch assets; and determining poor peoples\u2019 access, terms of exchange, returns, and livelihood \nstrategies and their outcomes for the poor.  \n \n10.  The TA will disaggregate different segments among the poor and women, who may have \nvaried needs and constraints that need to be identified. The research methods are based on \nopen-ended participatory and qualitative research tools.10 This approach will encourage the \nstudy teams to explore key issues that emerge in the region, by social group, culture, gender, \nage, occupation, or other dimensions of difference, which are of local importance. New and old \n                                                 \n8  The TA methodology was developed through national and provincial participatory workshops. \n9 Chambers, R. 1983.

", "4  \nstudy tools will be used to uncover and understand the perspectives and insights of the poor, \nenabling them to express and analyze their reality, with outsiders playing a facilitating role. Links \nwill be established between fieldwork and ongoing development activities and policy analysis. A \nsampling framework will be used for site selection, with geographic representation and diversity. \nSix  to  ten  sites  will  be  selected  per  province,  reflecting  different  ecological  zones  and \nsocioeconomic conditions, based on poverty criteria, and taking into account PMATU\u2019s selection \nof sites for the poverty monitoring survey. In this way a database of quantitative and qualitative \ninformation on poverty will be built for the region.  \n \n11.  TA teams will be oriented and trained in the study issues, methods, and reporting \nrequirements. Training will include methodology for gender assessment and analysis. Research \nmethods  will  be  tested  in  the  field.  Primary  data  gathering  will  be  done  by  participating \ncommunities and groups, with team members facilitating it. Gender-sensitive approaches will be \nused at all stages. Research findings from specific sites will be developed into site reports by \nthe TA teams with guidance from the national team. All reports will be translated into Khmer and \nmade widely available. Provincial and national workshops will disseminate research findings to \npolicymakers. All TA findings will be put on the Tonle Sap web site. ADB will publish the final TA \nreport. \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $300,000 equivalent, of which $145,000 will be \nforeign currency costs, and $155,000 will be local currency costs. ADB will provide $250,000 \nequivalent, on a grant basis, to finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $105,000 of local \ncurrency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by PRF and administered by ADB. The \nGovernment will finance approximately $50,000 in local currency costs to cover counterpart staff \nsupport,  office  accommodation,  and  facilities  for  workshops  and  meetings.  Details  of  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The Ministry of Planning (MOP), which is responsible for all data collection and analysis, \nwill be the TA Executing Agency.11 MOP will thus facilitate cooperation between NIS and \nPMATU, and among ADB consultants. An independent domestic research organization,12 the \nimplementing agency (IA), will implement the TA in cooperation with MOP. ADB will select the \nIA  using  the  quality  and  cost-based  selection  (QCBS)  procedure  in  accordance  with  the \nGuidelines on the Recruitment of Consultants to implement the PPA. The IA will house the \nnational consultant team as well as the TA teams. The IA will provide space; support services, \nincluding support staff; and research analysts to undertake fieldwork in selected sites in the \nproject area, site report preparation, and other work as required. The IA will appoint a project \ndirector from among its own staff to liaise with the national consultant team. The project director \nwill facilitate all TA workshops, seminars, etc. The TA will finance equipment, including two \n                                                 \n11 MOP has been selected for its central role in data collection and analysis, and monitoring of the National Poverty  \nReduction Strategy. MOP houses the General Secretariat for the Council for Social Development and includes NIS, \nwhich, under the Statistics Law, has overall responsibility for data collection and analysis of country statistics. MOP \nalso houses PMATU. \n12 There are a few well-established domestic institutes. The Cambodian Development Resource Institute (CDRI) is \namong the premier organizations engaged in research on political economy, poverty, labor and employment, \ngender,  natural  resource  management,  and  the  environment.  The  institute  is  well  reputed,  with  excellent \nprofessional capacity. The Cambodian Institute for Development and Peace (CIDP) is another well-established \ndomestic institute capable of conducting research and analysis on social and economic issues in Cambodia \ndevelopment.

MOP  will  set  up  the  project  advisory  committee  (PAC)  chaired  by  the  MOP \nundersecretary of state in charge of General Secretariat for the Council for Social Development \n(GSCSD).  PAC  members  will  consist  of  three  experts  on  poverty  and  participation,13  the \nPMATU head, director of NIS, members of GSCSD and ADB. The PAC will meet at least three \ntimes during the TA to take stock of implementation, ensure quality, discuss any outstanding \nissues, and ensure that reporting to the Government and ADB is done satisfactorily. The PAC \nwill ensure alignment between the TA and PMATU and NIS activities. At the provincial level, the \nProvincial  Rural  Development  Committee  (PRDC)  under  the  leadership  of  the  provincial \ngovernor or his nominee will constitute the steering committee for all provincial TA activities. \nThe provincial steering committee will meet thrice at least in the course of PPA implementation \nto take stock of progress and outcomes.  \n \n15.  A national multidisciplinary consultant team composed of an international consultant, \nteam  leader,  and  two  domestic  consultants  associated  with  international  consultants  will \nimplement the PPA and be responsible for final outputs. The TA will commence in January 2004 \nand be completed in March 2005. TA implementation will require approximately 4 person-\nmonths of international consultant inputs in PPA, and 15 person-months of domestic consultants \nin sociology, economics, and gender and development, among others. All consultants will be \nselected on an individual basis by ADB. All consultants will be selected in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. The terms of reference for the research institute and \nconsulting services are in Appendix 3.  \n \n16.  The consultants will submit the following reports at the end of periods indicated: (i) \ninception (3rd month), (ii) interim (8th month), (iii) draft final (13th month), and (iv) final (15th \nmonth).  Each  will  incorporate  comments  made  by  ADB,  the  Government,  and  other \nstakeholders. Brief monthly progress reports highlighting key issues and findings will also be \nrequired when other reports are not due. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 to the Government \nof Cambodia to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund for  \nthe Participatory Poverty Assessment of the Tonle Sap, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n                                                 \n13  MOP and ADB will invite these experts\u2014two international and one Cambodian\u2014to join the PAC.

Development  intervention  impacts,  and \npolicies  that  are  important  for  the  poor  need  to  be  discussed  with \ncommunities to know their perspectives on such activities as well as \npolicy impacts, and required changes. Macro policies to be addressed \ninclude, among others, those related to land, fisheries, forestry, allocation \nof productive resources and management of resources, especially the \nrole of poor communities in resource allocation and management. Other \npolicies include those related to human development, gender, and ethnic \nminorities.  Policies  related  to  rural  finance  and  development  of \ninfrastructure and markets determine the access of the poor to, among \nother things, credit, markets, and information. Policies on the labor market \nand on production of, and trade in, fisheries and agricultural commodities \ndetermine  the  terms  of  exchange  between  the  poor  and  interlocking \nservices and commodities and food markets. Gender policies and laws \ndetermine  women\u2019s  entitlements  to  resources,  opportunities,  and \noutcomes. Policies and practices related to ethnic minorities impact on \ntheir capacity to participate in local processes and structures. Social \nexclusion could be buttressed by exclusionary policies and may lead to \nissues of governance. The team leader will ensure that all such policies \nwill be discussed with the participating communities to elicit their views, \nincluding on what should be changed or improved. \n \n2.
