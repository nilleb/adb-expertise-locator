The  additional  financing  is  needed  to  support  critical  water  supply  and  sanitation \ninvestments for the ongoing project which were part of the original feasibility study and investment \nplan conducted by the Cities Development Initiative for Asia (CDIA) but not included due to limited \nfunds1. In particular, the project will finance: (i) the rehabilitation of water supply network in the \nremaining 12 district metered areas  established in the Shomansur district under the ongoing \nproject and construct additional facilities at water source locations (wells, pumping stations) as \nwell as rehabilitation of existing reservoir, and (ii) replacement of further portions of the main \nsewerage pipeline (Ayni and Muhammad collectors) and expansion of the network to unserved \nareas such as the Karotegin and Zebunisso areas. Climate and disaster-proofing measures \nidentified during project design will increase the resilience of water supply services and sanitation \nsystems.  \n \n2.  The project will provide additional support to the ongoing institutional strengthening \nactivities to improve the operations and maintenance (O&M) and financial management, billing, \nand commercial practices. It will continue supporting the establishment of a performance-oriented \nmanagement information system with the use of supervisory control and data acquisition  system \nfor operational efficiency and geographic information system for asset management and for \nefficient monitoring of district metered areas  and improved operational and business efficient \nservice delivery by the State Unitary Enterprise Dushanbevodokanal (DVK). \n \n3.

It will also \nbuild the capacity of DVK on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emergency response and \nimmediate  actions,  and  on  water,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  (WASH)  awareness  and WASH \ntargeted programs and measures for vulnerable people and women. The establishment of a \nwomen\u2019s training and empowerment center is proposed as a specific project gender-focused \noutput. The center will provide vocational, leadership, and business skills trainings to create the \nnecessary opportunities to help women realize their full potential and improve employment \nopportunities for women working in DVK, the Dushanbe City Administration, and other groups. It \nwill also encourage the education and skills training of young women. Moreover, the center will \nprovide counseling, rehabilitation, and shelter services for victims of gender-based violence.  \n \n4.  The total project cost is estimated at $38.00 million, of which $35 million will be financed \nfrom the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund \n[ADF]), $3.0 million will be financed by the ADF 13 Thematic Pool, and $3.80 million will be \nfinanced by the Government of Tajikistan toward financing of taxes and duties, land acquisition \nand resettlement costs, if required.
