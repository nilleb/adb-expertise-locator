During the Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) to the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  in  2002,  the  Government  requested  ADB  technical \nassistance (TA) for preparing the Jiangsu Urban Environment Improvement Project.1 The ADB \nTA Fact-Finding Mission visited the PRC in February 2003. An understanding was reached with \nthe Government on the scope, approach, and implementation and financing arrangements of \nthe TA in July 2003. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The PRC\u2019s energy requirements for economic growth are to a large extent met from \ndomestically produced coal. The PRC\u2019s primary commercial energy supply consists of coal \n(68%), followed by oil (21%),  hydropower (8%), and natural gas (3%). Total installed power \ngeneration capacity was about 353 gigawatts (GW) at the end of 2002, and is estimated to \nreach 540 GW by 2010. The PRC\u2019s power generation is predominantly coal-based (about 75%), \nfollowed by hydropower (about 24%), and by oil, natural gas, and nuclear power (about 1%). In \n2002 total coal production in the PRC was about 1.39 billion tons, which represented an \nincrease of about 26% over that in 2001. Domestic coal consumption in 2002 was estimated at \n1.3 billion tons. \n \n3.  The PRC\u2019s heavy dependence on coal as energy source has resulted in substantial \nenvironmental damage due to pollution from particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO ), \n2\nnitrogen oxides (NO ), and other harmful elements occurring in coal. SO  and NO  are the main \nx 2 x\nprecursor gases that cause acid rain, one of the largest environmental problems of the PRC and \nEast Asia. Approximately 80% of SO  emissions in the PRC originate from coal combustion in \n2\nthe power and industry sectors and result in estimated annual damages of $14 billion.2 A recent \nreport3 estimated that environmental costs of urban air pollution, indoor air pollution, and acid \nrain are 5%, 2%, and more than 1% of the gross domestic product, respectively. Carbon dioxide \n(CO ) is also a by-product of often inefficient coal combustion, while coal mining in the PRC is \n2\nassociated with the release of substantial quantities of methane (CH) into the atmosphere. Both \n4\nCO  and CH are harmful greenhouse gases. The PRC is the second largest CO  producing \n2 4 2\ncountry in the world and, if current trends continue, is expected to become the largest CO  \n2\nemitter by 2020. It is estimated that in 2002, about 6 billion cubic meters (m3) of CH, which was \n4\nproduced by coal mines in the PRC, was vented into the atmosphere. With the increasing depth \nof underground coal mining operations in the PRC, this volume is expected to increase in the \nfuture. The total CH reserves that could be produced from coal mines in the PRC up to a depth \n4\nof 2,000 meters are estimated at 30\u201335 trillion m3. \n \n4.  It is acknowledged that environmental pollution associated with the use of coal in the \nPRC has disproportionately affected the poor. Poorer households usually rely on raw coal and \nbiomass (for example wood and animal dung) for cooking and heating, and suffer accordingly \nfrom indoor air pollution. Also, coal is often used to produce town gas for distribution to urban \nhouseholds for cooking and heating; however, the production of town gas is associated with \nconsiderable pollution while town gas itself carries harmful substances and is relatively unsafe \nto use. The poor are the most vulnerable to diseases caused by environmental pollution and are \nthe least financially capable to seek medical care. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 5 May 2003. \n2  Based on 1995 data. \n3  ADB. 1998.  Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Promotion of Clean Technology \n(Cluster), Subproject 1, Final Report, 15 October 2001. Manila. ", "2 \n5.  In its Tenth Five-Year Plan, 2001\u20132005, the Government assigned high priority to \nincreasing the share of natural gas, which is a clean fuel, in the primary commercial energy \nsupply mix. For this purpose it has begun developing major gas infrastructure projects, including \na natural gas transmission pipeline from the Tarim Basin in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous \nRegion with estimated gas reserves of about 8.4 trillion m3 to the Shanghai area (the west-east \ngas pipeline) and three receiving terminals and related facilities in the provinces of Guangdong, \nFujian, and Jiangsu4 for the importation of liquefied natural gas (LNG). It is envisaged that the \nwest-east gas pipeline will supply 12 billion m3 of natural gas a year to the eastern part of the \nPRC by 2010 while at the same time, the two LNG projects in the provinces of Guangdong and \nFujian would be completed and would supply about 5.6 million tons of LNG a year, which, \nfollowing gasification of the LNG, would be equivalent to about 7.6 billion m3 of natural gas a \nyear. Initially, the main consumers of natural gas will be power plants. It is envisaged that over \nthe next 3 years, about 10 gas-fired power plants with a total capacity of 8,600 megawatts (MW) \nwill be constructed in the Shanghai area and near the locations of the LNG terminals. It is also \nenvisaged that, at the same time along the west-east gas pipeline, additional gas-based power \nplants with a total capacity of up to 3,000 MW will be built in the provinces of Henan, Jiangsu, \nand Zhenjiang. It is further estimated that there are about 17 million households in Shanghai \nand the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang alone, which would use natural gas; this number of \nhouseholds is expected to increase to 34 million in about 10 years. Natural gas from the East \nChina  Sea  has  already  been  successfully  introduced  in  Shanghai  and  is  being  used  by \ncommercial establishments and households throughout the city, with support from ADB.5 \n \n6.  The west-east gas pipeline is about 4,200 kilometers (km) long. It will traverse the \nXinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Henan, \nAnhui, and Jiangsu and will end in the Shanghai area. The cost of the west-east gas pipeline is \nestimated at $5.6 billion. It is to be constructed by a consortium of international oil and gas \ncompanies  comprising  PetroChina  (PRC,  50%),  Sinopec  (PRC,  5%),  ExxonMobil  (United \nStates,  15%),  Shell  (United  Kingdom,  15%),  and  Gazprom  (Russia,  15%).6  At  present, \nPetroChina has completed about 60% of the western section of the pipeline between the Tarim \nBasin in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the city of Jingbian in Shaanxi Province. It \nis expected that the eastern section of the pipeline from Shaanxi Province to the Shanghai area \nwill be completed by early January 2004. Subsequently, some natural gas from fields in Shaanxi \nProvince7 will be delivered in the Shanghai area, which will be followed by natural gas deliveries \nfrom the Tarim Basin by early 2005 when the entire pipeline will be completed. \n \n7.  Jiangsu is one of the PRC\u2019s fastest growing provinces with the private sector as the \nmajor source of growth. The provincial government of Jiangsu is planning to use as much \nnatural gas as possible from the west-east gas pipeline to reduce the use of coal, coal-based \ntown gas, and petroleum products (including liquefied petroleum gas [LPG]). At present, about \n80% of the commercial primary energy demand of Jiangsu is met by coal, with the remaining \n20% being met by hydropower, petroleum products, and nuclear power. The total installed \npower generation capacity in Jiangsu is about 21,300 MW, of which 97% consists of coal-fired \npower  generation  units.  In  2002,  power  consumption  increased  by  about  15.5%  and \nconstruction of additional power plants was required. Jiangsu consumes about 100 million tons \nof coal a year and imports about 75% from other provinces. Its extensive dependence on coal \n                                                 \n4  Its likely location would be Xitaiyangshadao Island in Rudong County in Jiangsu Province. \n5  ADB. 1995. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors for the Ping Hu Oil and Gas \nDevelopment Project. Manila. \n6  The five parties signed a framework agreement in July 2002 and the establishment of an official joint venture is \nexpected before the end of 2003. \n7  Originally, it was estimated that Shaanxi Province had proven gas reserves of about 200 billion m3. Following the \ndiscovery of the Sulige field in the Ordos Basin in 2001, its total proven gas reserves are now estimated at about \n735 billion m3; however, it is still uncertain how much of the additional gas reserves can be produced. ", "    3 \nfor meeting its energy requirements requires increasing investments in coal handling and \ntransportation infrastructure and has  led to serious environmental problems as a result of \nemissions of SO , PM, and NO . In particular, SO  emissions of about 1.1 million tons a year8 \n2 x 2\nare increasing occurrences of acid rain with detrimental impacts on human health, agricultural \nand  forestry  production,  water  quality,  biologically  important  ecosystems,  and  damage  to \ncultural and historical structures. The provincial government has been successful in reducing to \nsome extent the direct use of coal by commercial and residential consumers. Most cities have \ntown gas or LPG distribution pipeline systems that supply gas to such consumers for cooking \nand heating; however, due to the relatively high cost of producing town gas and purchasing \nLPG, most systems are not economical. Also, the provincial government has successfully \nadopted  an  environmental  information  disclosure  program,  which  rates  the  environmental \nperformance of industrial firms. Public disclosure of these ratings has been effective in moving \npoorly rated firms to improve their environmental performance. The information has enabled the \npublic to take action to monitor the environmental behavior of industrial firms.9 \n \n8.  When  construction  of  the  west-east  gas  pipeline  started,  the  Jiangsu  provincial \ngovernment prepared a master plan for introducing and using natural gas in Jiangsu with the \naim of consuming about 2.3 billion m3 in 2005. This amount is to increase further to about \n5.1 billion m3 after 2010 when the proposed LNG terminal in Jiangsu becomes operational. \nLikewise, the share of natural gas in the primary commercial energy mix is to increase to 3% \nand 6% in 2005 and 2010, respectively. Initially new power plants will be the main consumers of \nnatural gas, and four gas-fired power plants with a combined capacity of 3,000 MW are to be \nconstructed by 2010. At the same time, the Jiangsu provincial government would also like to \nincrease  the  use  of  natural  gas  by  other  consumers,  such  as  industries,  commercial \nestablishments, households in urban and rural areas, and vehicles. In particular, the provincial \ngovernment is planning to develop a demonstration project for the efficient use of natural gas \nusing advanced technologies that could serve as a model for other areas in the province. \nHowever, Jiangsu lacks the required policy and regulatory framework and technical expertise for \ndeveloping such a demonstration project and has requested ADB assistance.  \n \n9.  The Project is consistent with ADB's strategic objective to help the PRC improve the \nenvironment. Specifically, the proposed Project will support the PRC in meeting the challenges \nof  urbanization,  including  the  need  to  improve  the  urban  environmental  quality,  as  cities \ncontinue to grow rapidly with the influx of rural migrants. For this purpose, a proposed loan of \n$100 million has been included in the country program for 2004. The Project can serve as a \nmodel not only for other areas in the province but also for other energy-deficit and coal-\ndependent provinces in the PRC. This should pave the way for further ADB interventions for \nimproving the urban environment in the coastal region. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n10.  The project preparatory TA will assist the provincial government of Jiangsu in developing \na natural gas demonstration project to maximize the efficient use of natural gas in both urban \nand rural areas of the province and reduce present pollution levels. The main output will be a \ncomprehensive feasibility study that will address the proposed optimization of the configuration \nof the high-, medium-, and low-pressure pipelines, which are to be constructed or modified \n                                                 \n8  Mainly related to coal use in power plants, of which less than 5% has flue gas desulfurization equipment, and in \nindustries. \n9  ADB is funding a study to support the development of similar environmental disclosure programs elsewhere in the \nPRC. ", "4 \n(existing  ones  for  the  distribution  of  coke  oven  gas  for  commercial  and  residential  use); \nconstruction  of  additionally  required  modern  gas  infrastructure;  production  and  use  of \ncompressed natural gas (CNG) for transportation, and distribution of CNG to rural areas for \nresidential consumption; use of natural gas for heating and cooling of buildings; closure of \npolluting coke oven gas production plants; conversion of coal-fired boilers in industries to gas-\nfired ones; development of appropriate gas tariffs for urban and rural consumers; investment \nrequirements  and  possible  mechanisms  for  private  and  public  sector  participation;  and \nstrengthening and capacity building for companies that would operate the natural gas and CNG \ndistribution systems. The TA will review the policy and regulatory framework of the natural gas \nsector in Jiangsu and identify relevant issues. The TA will also screen the probable impact of \nthe proposed investment on minority ethnic groups. The social and environmental assessments \nare presented in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will be implemented in close consultation with all stakeholders and interested \nparties, including targeted consumers and potential private sector investors. For this purpose, \ntwo workshops will be held at the midterm stage and the end of TA implementation to explain \nand discuss the consultants\u2019 findings and recommendations of the TA. At the midterm stage, the \nprovincial  government,  the  consultants,  and  ADB  will  decide  which  proposed  project \ncomponents  appear  to  be  sufficiently  technically  feasible  for  inclusion  in  a  natural  gas \ndemonstration project. During TA implementation, the consultants will work closely with  staff \nfrom the concerned technical design institutes and the Jiangsu Natural Gas Investment and \nDevelopment Co., Ltd. (JNGIDCL), which was established by the Jiangsu provincial government \nto develop gas infrastructure in Jiangsu Province. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $700,000 equivalent comprising $307,000 as \nforeign exchange and $393,000 equivalent as local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $500,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $193,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding  program.  The  Government  will  finance  the  balance  of  the  local  currency  costs, \nequivalent to $200,000, by providing of counterpart staff, office and communication facilities \nrequired  for  the  consulting  services,  secretarial  support,  seminars,  and  relevant  studies, \nsurveys, and reports. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The provincial government of Jiangsu will be the executing agency for the TA and will \nassign the JNGIDCL as implementing agency to work with the consultants. A working group, \ncomprising representatives from the Development Planning Commission of Jiangsu Province; \nJNGIDCL; the Development Planning Committee of Zhenjiang Municipality; Zhenjiang Natural \nGas Co., Ltd.; and representatives of envisaged major gas consumers, such as industries and \ncommercial enterprises, will be established. The working group will regularly meet with the \nconsultants to discuss the progress of TA implementation. The provincial government will make \nall relevant studies, reports, and surveys available to the consultants. \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented by an internationally recognized consulting firm or institute \nin association with domestic consultants over a period of about 7 months starting in January \n2004 and is expected to be completed in July 2004. The team of consultants will comprise six \ninternational  experts  with  experience  in  (i) planning  natural  gas  transmission  and  storage ", "    5 \nsystems; (ii) natural gas distribution (including CNG applications) and conversion (including \ntown gas and LPG distribution systems and coal-fired industrial boilers); (iii) financial and \ninstitutional  aspects  of  natural  gas  transmission,  distribution,  and  utilization;  (iv)  economic \nanalysis of energy projects (including the development of indicators for monitoring the economic \nand environmental impacts of energy projects); (v) environmental impact assessment of energy \nprojects; and (vi) analysis of social and poverty reduction aspects of energy projects. The expert \nwith experience in planning gas transmission and storage systems or natural gas distribution \nand conversion will act as the team leader. The international consultants will be assisted by six \ndomestic experts with experience in (i) natural gas transmission and distribution; (ii) conversion \nof coal-fired boilers to natural gas; (iii) CNG applications; (iv) energy economics; (v) financial \nand institutional analyses, and (vi) environmental impact assessment of energy projects. It is \nestimated that the input of the international consultants will be about 8 person-months\u20146 in the \nfield  and  about  2  in  their  home  office.  The  input  of  the  domestic  consultants  will  be  an \naggregated 23\u201412 in the field and 11 in the home office. The outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants are in Appendix 4.  \n \n15.  The consultants will prepare an inception report 2-4 weeks after the consulting services \nbegin. Formal tripartite review meetings to discuss the consultants\u2019 midterm and final reports will \nbe held within 3 and 5 months, respectively, after commencement of the consulting services. \nADB will recruit the international and domestic consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants using the quality, and cost-based selection procedure and simplified \ntechnical  proposals,  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants.  ADB  will  finance  the  attendance  of  a  Government  observer  at  the  contract \nnegotiations, which will be held at ADB headquarters in Manila. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for preparing the Jiangsu Urban Environment \nImprovement Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoals       \n       \nReduced environmental  Reduced the share of coal  National reports and statistics  Insufficient mobilization of \npollution associated with  and increase the share of    required financing for \nenergy consumption in the  natural gas in national  Country and sector  infrastructure development \nPeople\u2019s Republic of  commercial energy  consultation missions   \nChina  consumption    Adoption of appropriate national \n    policies \nReduced environmental   \npollution in areas where  Economic slowdown \nnatural gas has been \nintroduced \n \nPurpose       \n       \nDevelop a comprehensive  Adopt new natural gas  Annual reports and statistics  Delay in completing the west-\nnatural gas utilization  technologies and increase  by the Development Planning  east gas pipeline \ndemonstration project  consumption of natural  Commission of Jiangsu   \nbased on advanced  gas equivalent to 6% of  Province  Inability to mobilize required \nnatural gas technologies  primary commercial    investments for developing gas \n  energy consumption  Provincial and local indicators  infrastructure in Jiangsu \nImprove the environment    for emissions of sulfur oxides  Province \nin Jiangsu Province  Improve air quality  (SO) and particulate matter   \n2\n      Development of appropriate \n  Reduce occurrence of  Annual reports and statistics  regulatory framework and tariffs \nacid rain  by producers and distributors  for consumption of natural gas \n  of commercial energy   \nInvestments in new natural \ngas technologies \n \n       \nOutputs       \nComprehensive feasibility  General agreement to and  Tripartite review meetings and  Delay in obtaining relevant data \nstudy for establishing a  adoption of the findings  reports submitted by  and information \nnatural gas demonstration  and recommendations of  consultants  \nproject  the feasibility study by all \n  concerned parties \nRecommended gas tariffs   \nfor urban and rural \nconsumers \n \nIdentification of possible \nmechanisms for private \nand public sector \nparticipation and \nrequirements for \ninstitutional strengthening \nand capacity building \n       \nInputs       \n       \nReview the proposed  International consulting  Tripartite review meetings,  Satisfactory coordination and \noptimization of the  services for 8 person- and reports submitted by  cooperation among the various \nconfiguration of the high-,  months  consultants  government organizations \nmedium-, and low-    involved  \npressure pipelines, which  Domestic consulting   \nare to be constructed or  services for 23 person- Successful cooperation \nmodified  months  between consultants and \n    counterpart agencies ", "  Appendix 1  7 \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \n   \nIdentify additionally  ADB financing of $500,000 \nrequired modern gas  including $193,000 \ninfrastructure  equivalent in local \n  currency \nDetermine the feasibility of   \nproducing and using com- Government contribution \npressed natural gas  in kind of $200,000 \n(CNG) for transportation  equivalent for financing \nand distribution of CNG to  counter-part staff; office \nrural areas for residential  and communication \nconsumption; use of  facilities; secretarial \nnatural gas for heating  support; provision of \nand cooling of buildings;  relevant studies, surveys, \nclosure of polluting coke  and reports; and local \noven gas production  workshops \nplants; and conversion of \ncoal-fired boilers in \nindustries to gas-fired \nones \n \nSet appropriate gas tariffs \nfor urban and rural \nconsumers \n \nIdentify investment \nrequirements and possible \nmechanisms for private \nand public sector \nparticipation \n \nIdentification of required \ninstitutional strengthening \nand capacity building \n \nWorkshops  \n \n \n \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \nSOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.
