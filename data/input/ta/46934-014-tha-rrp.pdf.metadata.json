I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan of B1,650 million (or its equivalent in US dollars if baht are not available), and (ii) proposed \nadministration of a loan not exceeding $35 million or 15% of project costs (whichever is less), to \nbe provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Clean Technology Fund (CTF),1 both to \nSolarco Company Limited for the Central Thailand Solar Power Project in Thailand.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n2.  The 57 megawatt (MW) Central Thailand Solar Power Project is part of the long-term \ngrowth  strategy  of  Electricity  Generating  Public  Company  (EGCO),  which  emphasizes \nexpanding investments into renewable energy to strengthen its business in independent power \ngeneration in Thailand. With its recent acquisitions and projects currently under development, \nEGCO plans to increase its installed renewable energy capacity to more than 300 MW by \n2015.3 EGCO\u2019s strategy aligns with the Renewable and Alternative Energy Development Plan, \n2012\u20132021 approved by the Government of Thailand in December 2011, which sets a target of  \n2,000 MW of solar power capacity by 2021. The plan also sets a target of generating 25% of \nprimary energy from renewable sources by 2021, thereby avoiding 76 million tons of carbon \nemissions annually.  \n \n3.  The project is eligible for cofinancing from the ADB CTF.4 The Clean Technology Fund \nprovides concessional financing to support the rapid deployment of low-carbon technologies \nwith significant potential to reduce and avoid greenhouse gas emissions over the long term. It is \nadministered through multilateral development banks, including ADB, and is one of the largest \nfunds helping developing countries fill gaps in financing projects to mitigate climate change. The \nCTF trust fund committee approved the allocation of $99.5 million for the CTF Thailand Private \nSector Renewable Energy Program on 24 May 2012, to be utilized and administered by ADB.5 \nThe proposed project is the third private sector project in Thailand6 under the ADB CTF7 \n(approved and under due diligence), for a total allocation of $54 million to date. \n \n4.  As of September 2012, Thailand had 32,000 MW of installed power generation capacity. \nThe country\u2019s electricity production depends heavily on conventional fuels, with 66% produced \nusing natural gas and 20% using coal and lignite. Natural gas has traditionally provided a \nreliable and low-cost source of energy, but growing demand and dwindling natural gas reserves \nfrom the Gulf of Thailand mean the country must diversify and secure alternative fuel sources \nfor power generation. Fortunately, Thailand has abundant renewable energy sources\u2014biomass, \n                                                \n1  Financed by the Clean Technology Fund. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  EGCO\u2019s current operating installed capacity for renewable energy includes 9.9 MW of biomass and 63 MW of \nsolar.   \n4  Climate Investment Funds. http://www.climateinvestmentfunds.org. \n5  ADB Thailand Private Sector Renewable Energy Program approved by the CTF Trust Fund Committee on 24 May \n2012 pursuant to the Financial Procedures Agreement entered into between ADB and the International Bank for \nReconstruction and Development as trustee of the Trust Fund for the Clean Technology Fund, 18 March 2010. \n6  The first two private sector projects identified under the ADB CTF are the Provincial Solar Power Project and the \nTheppana Wind Power Project.    \n7  ADB. 2009.

Using these domestic sources of renewable energy can \nboost Thailand\u2019s energy security, save foreign exchange, and protect the country from global \nprice fluctuations in energy markets.  \n \n5.  To  complement  its  renewable  energy  strategy,  the  Ministry  of  Energy  advocates \ndecentralized power generation mainly by supporting the country\u2019s small power producer (SPP) \nand very small power producer (VSPP) programs. The SPP program allows private developers \nto  build,  own,  and  operate  10\u201390  MW  power  projects  and  enter  into  power  purchase \nagreements (PPAs) with the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT). Under the \nVSPP  program,  producers  of  up to  10  MW may  sell  power to the Metropolitan  Electricity \nAuthority or the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA). Renewable energy SPPs and VSPPs are \neligible for a feed-in tariff (or \u201cadder\u201d) in addition to the wholesale electricity price.    \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n2.  The Borrower and Sponsors \n6.  Solarco,  a special-purpose  company  incorporated  in Thailand  and  100%  owned  by \nYanhee EGCO Holding (YEH), will develop the project. EGCO owns all the common shares of \nYEH  and  has  exclusive  rights  to  manage  YEH  and  Solarco.  EGCO  is  Thailand\u2019s  first \nindependent power producer and is currently the second largest private power producer in the \ncountry. EGAT privatized EGCO in 1992; it was listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand in \n1995.  EGCO  is  25.4%  owned  by  EGAT  and  23.9%  by  TEPDIA  Generating.8 EGCO  has \ninvested in power projects in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, the Philippines, and Thailand \nwith a total installed capacity of 6,194 MW.9 Yanhee Solar Power owns the YEH preferred \nshares. The founder of Yanhee International Hospital owns Yanhee Solar Power.10  \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n7.  The project will diversify Thailand's energy mix by adding renewable energy capacity, \nthus helping the country progress toward its clean energy targets.11 To achieve sustainable \nlong-term economic growth, Thailand is promoting alternative sources of energy such as solar \nfor power generation, and is beginning its transition to a low-carbon economy. Solar energy is a \nclean  and  sustainable  source  of  electricity  that  diversifies  the  country\u2019s  energy  mix, \nstrengthening energy security and reducing reliance on fossil fuel. \n \n8.  The project contributes to accelerating and expanding private investment in clean energy \ninfrastructure in Thailand. Successful project implementation and viable returns are expected to \nattract other private investors to solar energy projects. \n \n                                                \n8  TEPDIA Generating is jointly owned 50% each by Mitsubishi and Tokyo Electric Power. \n9  This figure includes projects under development. \n10 Dr. Supot Sumritvanitcha is the founder of Yanhee International Hospital. Yanhee is a multiservice general hospital \nin Bangkok that specializes in a range of medical and cosmetic services. Yanhee comprises a hospital with a 400-\nbed capacity, 95 outpatient rooms, 12 major and 30 minor operating rooms, an intensive care department, \nemergency rooms, delivery rooms, and a nursery. The founder of Yanhee has some experience in renewable \nenergy through a prior solar power project in 2011.   \n11 The government has established clean energy targets of 2,000 MW of solar power by 2021 and 25% of primary \ncommercial energy from renewable sources by 2021. ", "  3 \n2.  Outcome \n9.  The outcome will be the demonstrated viability and sustainability of a utility-scale solar \nproject in the private sector. Avoided carbon dioxide emissions are considered an outcome \nindicator in addition to the usual financial and operating indicators. \n \n3.  Output \n10.  The output will be a 57 MW solar power project constructed and commissioned. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n11.  Consistency with Strategy 2020. ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 supports development that is \nenvironmentally sustainable and enlists the private sector to meet growing energy demand in \nthe region, capitalizing on ADB\u2019s operating strengths in infrastructure development, finance, and \nother areas.12 The strategy supports expanding environment-friendly technologies for clean and \nefficient energy generation and use, as well as a larger role for private sector financing of \ninfrastructure through public\u2013private partnerships. \n \n12.  Consistency with the country strategy. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2007\u2013\n2011 for Thailand has three core strategic areas: infrastructure, environmental sustainability, \nand capital markets.13 The government\u2019s Alternative Energy Development Plan, 2012\u20132021 \nnotes the immense potential for solar power in Thailand and that energy imports can be avoided \nthrough  its  use  with  private  investment.  The  project  supports  the  government\u2019s  long-term \nobjective for the Thailand Clean Technology Fund Investment Plan to use ADB CTF resources \nto support renewable energy projects in the private sector.14 \n \n13.  Consistency with the Energy Policy. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Energy \nPolicy, which emphasizes investments in energy efficiency, renewable energy projects, and \nwider access to energy.15 It advances ADB\u2019s target of investing $2 billion per year in clean \nenergy  by  2013  to  accelerate  low-carbon  growth  and  reduce  regional  greenhouse  gas \nemissions, as well as the target of the Private Sector Operations Department to attain 25% of its \nannual approvals for clean energy projects. Further, under the Asia Solar Energy Initiative, ADB \nis committed to identifying, developing, and assisting implementation of  3,000 MW of new solar \npower projects by 2013, providing up to $2.25 billion in financing and leveraging an additional \n$6.75 billion.  \n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2008.

EGCO owns all the \ncommon shares of YEH and has exclusive rights to manage YEH. EGCO is \nThailand\u2019s first independent power producer and is currently the second largest \nprivate power producer in the country.  \n \nImplementation period  First quarter 2013\u2013fourth quarter 2013 \nConstruction period of 8\u201310 months \n \nConstruction arrangements  The  project  will  be  developed  under  two  fixed-price,  date-certain,  EPC \narrangements. \n \nSupplier, contractor  Both  EPC  arrangements  will  supply  multi-crystalline  PV  modules  from  REC \nModules, a subsidiary of REC, which was established in 1996 and is a leading \nvertically integrated solar firm. It is based in Norway and listed on the Oslo Stock \nExchange.  The  modules  are  manufactured  in  Singapore  at  an  integrated \nproduction facility with an annual capacity of 800 MW for 2012. The REC solar \nmodule was announced as the best performer in the independent Photon Field \nPerformance Test, which demonstrated a 6% greater electricity yield on average \ncompared with other leading solar PV firm modules.a  \n \nThe first EPC arrangement (EPC I) includes Phoenix Solar (Singapore), which will \nbe responsible for the design and supply of PV modules and inverters, and \nPESCO, which will be responsible for the construction and supply of the balance of \nplant equipment. Phoenix Solar (Singapore) and PESCO are jointly and severally \nresponsible for all liabilities under the EPC I.  \n \nPhoenix Solar (Singapore) is a subsidiary of Phoenix Solar, a leading international \nPV system integrator. Phoenix Solar develops, constructs, and operates large-\nscale PV plants and is a specialist in turnkey arrangements. The company has sold \nsolar modules with a peak power of more than 1 gigawatt since it was first founded. \nPhoenix Solar is based in Germany and is listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. \nPESCO,  established  in  1986,  is  a  Thai  mechanical  and  electrical  contractor. \nPESCO provides a full scope of services in the design, supply, and installation of \nturnkey  projects.  Phoenix  Solar  (Singapore)  and  PESCO  have  experience  in \nThailand as contractors for a 16 MW solar power project.  \n \nThe second EPC arrangement (EPC II) includes Italthai, which will be responsible \nfor the design and construction, as well as the supply of inverters and the balance \nof plant equipment. REC Modules will be responsible for the supply of PV modules. \nThe EPC II arrangement has two points of responsibility and division of obligations \nunder two parallel contracts. REC Modules will guarantee module defects and the \n25-year efficiency warranty of the modules. Italthai will provide delay damages and \nguarantee the plant performance ratio for 2 years.   \n \nItalthai is a related company of Italian-Thai Development Public Company, which is \none of the largest construction contractors in Thailand and is listed on the Stock \nExchange of Thailand. It has more than 50 years of experience in construction and \n                                                \n16  Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).
