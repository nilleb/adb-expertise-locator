INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During  the  2006  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide a project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA) for the Silk Road Ecosystem Restoration Project.1 The TA \nwill help prepare an investment project to meet the PRC\u2019s goals of promoting environmental \nsustainability through ecosystem restoration. At the request of the Government, ADB fielded a \nFact-Finding Mission in July 2007. The Mission visited the project area and held discussions \nwith representatives of the national and provincial governments and other key stakeholders to \nreach  an  understanding  on  the  detailed  TA  design,  implementation  arrangements,  cost \nestimates, and consultants\u2019 terms of reference. The TA design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. The concept paper was approved on 23 May 2007.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The drylands of western PRC cover about 40% of the country and contain some of the \nmost severely degraded land in the country and in the world. The proposed project area covers \ndistricts and counties selected from some of the worst affected, poorer parts of Gansu and  \nShaanxi provinces, and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (UAR).3 The connections between \ndryland degradation, poverty, and rapid population growth in the project area have been well \ndocumented.4  Between  1980  and  2006,  the  combined  population  of  Gansu,  Shaanxi,  and \nXinjiang UAR increased from 59.8 million to 83.9 million, or by 40.2%. The population of their \nethnic  minorities  grew  from  9.2  to  15.2  million,  or  by  65%,  over  the  same  period.  Land \ndegradation  is  a  critical  environmental  problem  in  all  three  project  jurisdictions,  seriously \naffecting 274,600 square kilometers (km2) of land in Gansu (65% of its total area), 30,000 km2 in \nShaanxi (14.5% of the province), and 1.1 million km2,or 64% of the total area of Xinjiang. The \neconomic cost of land degradation is estimated at CNY3.1 billion in Gansu, and CNY11.6 billion \nin Shaanxi, or 15.9% and 3.6%, respectively, of provincial gross domestic product. \n \n3.  The project area includes three distinct ecological zones: the loess plateau, the central \nmountain region, and the oasis in Xinjiang UAR. The ancient Silk Road route ran through this \narea, starting in the west near Xian and running eastward through Gansu and Xinjiang. The \nloess plateau in the PRC is characterized by fine, wind-blown soil that is very deep\u2014up to 200 \nmeters, in places\u2014and highly prone to erosion. This soil is the source of most of the sediment \nthat gives the Yellow River its distinctive coloring downstream from the plateau to the sea and \ncreates problems of sedimentation. Much of the area of eastern Gansu and Shaanxi provinces \nlies on the loess plateau. Agriculture is predominantly rainfed, producing relatively low-value \nand  low-yielding  annual  crops.  The  region\u2019s  natural  environment  is  being  improved  by \ninvestment by the people of the area, with support from the local and central governments. The \ncentral  mountain  region  includes  the  Qinling  Mountains  in  Shaanxi  province,  the  Qilian \nMountains in Gansu province, and the Qianshan Mountains in Xinjiang UAR. It contains several \nnational nature and forest reserve areas that provide important habitats for endangered and \n                                                 \n1  Formerly the Ecosystem Restoration in Three Northwest Provinces Project. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 27 July 2007. \n3  The project area covers 301,700 square kilometers (km2), including 18 districts and 57 counties across Gansu, \nShaanxi, and Xinjiang UAR. The area\u2019s population totals about 83.9 million, of whom 63.7% live in rural areas. In \n2006, average annual urban income in the project area was CNY9,103 (equivalent to $1,097), while the average \nannual per capita rural income was only CNY2,377 ($286)\u2014which is about equal to the poverty line, defined as $1 \nper day.  \n4  ADB. 2004. Financial Arrangement for a Proposed Global Environment Facility Grant and Asian Development Bank \nTechnical Assistance to the People's Republic of China for Capacity Building to Combat Land Degradation Project. \nManila. ", "2   \nprotected species. The third zone\u2014the desert oasis areas in Xinjiang UAR\u2014is home to virtually \nall of the UAR\u2019s people and agricultural activities, but makes up only 4% of its territory. The \noases require irrigation for agriculture, and their desert climate features harsh winters and \nsummers of extreme heat and high winds. To improve economic prospects and living conditions \nin this region, the establishment of shelter-belt green areas to prevent the shifting of the desert \nsands,  and  the  construction  of  water  management  infrastructure\u2014e.g.,  canals,  wells,  high \nefficiency irrigation\u2014are vital. Oasis farming of grapes, melons, and such traditional crops as \ncotton and wheat, forms the core of the local residents\u2019 agricultural activities.  \n \n4.  The  TA  fits  within  the  framework  of  the  PRC-Global  Environmental  Facility  (GEF)5 \npartnership  for  land  degradation  in  dryland  ecosystems,  which  seeks  to  combat  land \ndegradation, reduce poverty, and conserve biodiversity through capacity-building investments \nand demonstration investment projects (footnote 4). ADB\u2019s first project under the partnership, \nthe Capacity Building to Combat Land Degradation Project (CBCLDP), has been underway in \nsix western provinces and autonomous regions since July 2004, including Gansu, Shaanxi, and \nXinjiang UAR.6 \n \n5.  Experiences from the implementation of CBCLDP emphasize the need for (i) a multi-\nsectoral approach to the land degradation problem, (ii) policies at the central and provincial \nlevels to support integrated ecosystem management, (iii) the continual building of provincial and \nlocal implementation and coordination capacities to address land degradation problems, (iv) the \nadoption  of  environmental  laws  and  policy  frameworks  by  the  Government,  and  (v) \nstrengthening the capacity of local stakeholders to manage their resources. \n  \n6.  Promoting environmental improvement by reversing natural resource degradation and \npreserving farmland is one of the strategic priorities in the country strategy and program update \n(2006\u20132008) of ADB\u2019s operations in the PRC,7 and is also consistent with the PRC\u2019s 11th Five-\nYear Plan.  \n \nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n  \n7.  The  proposed  Project  is  expected  to  have  a  positive  impact  on  poverty  and  land \ndegradation through targeted interventions that will contribute to restoring the productive and \nprotective functions of the ecosystem along the old Silk Road covering three provinces in  the \nwestern PRC. To achieve this impact, the TA will produce a feasibility study to design an \ninvestment project for sustainable use of natural resources in the project area. The targeted \ninterventions  may  include  (i)  sustainable  livelihood  development,  (ii)  protection  and \n                                                 \n5  The Global Environment Facility (GEF) provides grants to developing countries for projects that benefit the global \nenvironment and promote sustainable livelihoods in local communities. The GEF is the world's largest provider of \ngrants and concessionary in the focal areas of climate change, biodiversity, land degradation, international waters, \nozone depletion, and persistent organic pollutants. ADB has been working closely with GEF since the mid 1990s. \nWith the approval of ADB's direct access to full project resources in 2002, the partnership has been further \nstrengthened. Direct access to GEF resources enables ADB to (i) identify, prepare, appraise, and implement GEF \nprojects on behalf of GEF and ADB's developing member countries; (ii) submit full project proposals for GEF \nfinancing directly; and (iii) receive project grants directly from GEF and be directly accountable for their use. The \nADB-GEF partnership provides substantial opportunities to blend ADB resources for sustainable development with \nGEF resources for the global environment. \n6  The partnership also covers Inner Mongolia, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and Qinghai province. \n7  ADB. 2006.

The TA will use a participatory approach and will be implemented in two phases over 8 \nmonths. There will be a 1-month break after the end of phase 1. During phase 1, the consulting \nteam, conferring with the provincial and local authorities, will (i) conduct assessments of sectors, \ninstitutions, strategies, policies, and plans;8 (ii) appraise the project proposals prepared by the \nprovincial governments; (iii) assess a range of problems constraining economic and ecosystem \ndevelopment, including ecosystem protection, rehabilitation, and sustainable land and farm \nmanagement; (iv) undertake wide stakeholder consultations and workshops, and, during the \ninception  and  midterm  phases,  conduct  social,  poverty,  institutional,  and  environmental \nassessments and surveys, as well as any others that are necessary; (v) conduct ecosystem \nsurveys  and    comprehensive  assessments  to  determine  the  existing  baseline  situations, \nincluding  those  of  habitat,  land degradation,  and  biodiversity,  in  the  project  area;  and  (vi) \nevaluate  the  impact  of  the  ongoing  progress  on  land  degradation  mitigation  in  dryland \necosystems, including lessons learned. The initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n9.  Phase 2 will build on the outputs of phase 1. Based on the phase 1 outcome and \nconsultations with the stakeholders, the consulting team will prepare a comprehensive, detailed \nfeasibility  report  covering  (i)  project  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  and  activities;  (ii)  financial, \neconomic, social, and environmental safeguards; (iii) relevant sector analysis; (iv) the roles and \ninstitutional  capacities  of  participating  agencies;  (v)  implementation  arrangements;  and  (vi) \ninterrelated  issues  of  poverty  reduction,  gender,  good  governance,  and  private  sector \ndevelopment. To create a stronger sense of ownership, it will be important to ensure that the \ninvestment plans are (i) consistent with the government strategies and plans; and (ii) endorsed \nby the stakeholders, including beneficiaries, participating institutions, and other development \npartners.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $1.2 million. ADB will finance $800,000 on \na  grant  basis  through  its  TA  funding  program.  The  Government  will  contribute  $400,000 \nequivalent  for  office  space,  counterpart  staff,  site  transportation,  and  other  services.  The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. \n \n11.  The proposed GEF-financed components will be prepared in coordination with this TA \nwhen the project preparatory grant funds become available from GEF. These will focus on \naspects of the Project that will generate environmental benefits of global significance, including \nbiodiversity conservation through management of protected areas along the Silk Road Corridor, \ncarbon sequestration, promotion of sustainable land management practices, and institutional \ncapacity building for effective implementation of the GEF-financed components. \n  \n \n \n                                                 \n8  Production of reports suitable for public dissemination based on this analysis will be encouraged, and the \npreparation of such reports will be coordinated with the ongoing technical assistance to combat land degradation \n(footnote 4). ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The State Forestry Administration will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the TA, and the \nforestry departments of Gansu, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang UAR will be the implementing agencies \n(IAs). The EA will (i) facilitate coordination among the three provinces, TA consultants, local \nexperts, and ADB; and (ii) provide access to data and other information that will be required in \nthe formulation of the Project. A national leading group at the State Forestry Administration and \nthree provincial leading groups (PLGs) will be established to coordinate the overall project \npreparation. The PLGs will be chaired by the vice-governor, and represented by the relevant \nprovincial  government  departments  and  other  stakeholders  to  ensure  provincial  level \ncoordination for project preparation. The PLGs will be supported by the technical management \noffice (TMO) to oversee the overall TA implementation and provide guidance. The PLGs will (i) \nprovide support to the TA consultants and be responsible for assisting the TA team in gathering \nand compiling data; (ii) assist in liaising with local authorities, and in securing timely government \napprovals related to land acquisition, environment, resettlement plans, and subproject designs; \n(iii) help the TA team organize meetings and workshops with stakeholders to help prepare a \nless complex project design for project sustainability; and (iv) provide technical support to the \nTA team in finalizing the feasibility study. The TMO will be supported by full-time staff to assist \nthe TA team.  \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented over 8 months from March to October 2008. It will require \n16.5 person-months of international and 62 person-months of national consulting services. A \nconsulting firm will be engaged, according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). ADB will select and engage the consulting firm on the \nbasis of the quality of their proposals and cost of the services to be provided\u2014with a quality-\ncost ratio of 80:20\u2014following simplified technical proposal procedures. The consulting firm will \nsubmit (i) an inception report 4 weeks from the start of its services; (ii) an interim report, within \n20 weeks; (iii) a draft final report, within 30 weeks; and (iv) a final report, within 32 weeks, after \nincorporating the comments of the EA and ADB. The consultants will submit six copies of each \nreport in both English and Chinese to the Government, and three copies of the English version \nto ADB, including one electronic copy on a compact disc. The draft final report will be structured \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s format for the report and recommendation of the President (RRP), \nand will cover each topic by chapter sufficiently for ADB to prepare the RRP. Three stakeholder \nconsultations workshops will be held, one each before the finalization of the inception, the \ninterim, and the draft final reports. The proposed workshops, training, and surveys will be \nadministered by the consultants, in consultation with the EA. Equipment for the TA will be \nprocured  by  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time), and will be handed over to the EA upon completion of the TA. The \noutline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Silk Road Ecosystem \nRestoration Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "Appendix 1  5\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nRestored productive and  (cid:131) By 2014, the incomes of  (cid:131) Comparison of survey  (cid:131) Project design is \nprotective functions of the  farm families increased  results at project  implemented effectively. \necosystem along the old  by 30%  completion with the   \nSilk Road in western PRC     baseline survey  Risks \n  (cid:131) By 2014, the protected  collected at project   \nforest and buffer zones  inception  (cid:131) The Government\u2019s priorities \nincreased by 90,000    change or it is reluctant to \nhectares  (cid:131) Employment statistics,  accept the recommended \n  forestry statistics,  measures. \n(cid:131) By 2014, natural  measures of land use   \nvegetative cover to  and land degradation,  (cid:131) Macroeconomic environment \nprotect vulnerable assets and household income  in the PRC suffers a major \nincreased by 160,000  surveys  downturn. \nhectares   \n(cid:131) Land use surveys \ncarried out by the Project\nand project \nimplementation \nmonitoring (use of \nremote sensing and GIS \nto track expansion of \nforest cover in project \nareas) \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nProject design and  Agreement reached  MOU signed by the  (cid:131) Government priorities for the \nfeasibility study  between the Government  Government and ADB  environment and western \nacceptable to the  and ADB on the final loan  development do not change.\nGovernment and ADB  project design by 2008  (cid:131) The Government obtains \n  necessary counterpart \nfunding. \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \nFeasibility report suitable  The report accepted by  (cid:131) The EA has adequate \nfor ADB processing  ADB and the Government  capacity and support from \ncompleted, including:    provincial authorities. \n  (cid:131) Consulting team is given \naccess to required data. \n \n1.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nThe country strategy and program for the People's Republic of China (PRC) (2004\u25002006) outlines the Asian Development \nBank's (ADB) strategy in supporting the Government\u2019s ongoing poverty reduction efforts. The majority of the poor live in \nthe western provinces that lag well behind the eastern provinces in progress towards achievement of the PRC\u2019s Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Poverty is strongly correlated in the western region with land and environmental degradation because \nthe lack of alternative livelihoods has led to unsustainable land-use practices. The Project is aimed at creating pro-poor \neconomic growth in these provinces. Ongoing ADB-supported policy work is addressing poverty-related issues, including \nland degradation. The Project will support the Government\u2019s fight against poverty by addressing environmental problems \nrelated to land degradation and promoting rural development in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces and the Xinjiang Uygur \nAutonomous Region (UAR) in the western PRC. \n \nThe poverty partnership agreement, signed between the Government and ADB in September 2003, sets out strategies and \ninterventions for poverty reduction. The PRC and ADB will continue to cooperate on a broad range of activities related to \npolicy and regulatory reform, and capacity building, in the environment sector, and to support projects to address \nenvironment  problems.  To  sharpen  the  poverty  focus,  ADB  is  supporting  the  implementation  of  the  PRC-Global \nEnvironmental  Facility  partnership  for  degradation  in  dryland  ecosystems.  It  aims  to  reduce  poverty,  arrest  land \ndegradation, and restore dryland ecosystems in the western region. \n \nThe project area has a population of about 83.9 million, of whom 63.7% reside in the rural areas. In 2006, the average \nannual income of the urban residents was CNY9,103 ($1,097 equivalent) while the average annual per capita income of \nthe rural population in the project area was CNY2,377\u2014the equivalent of  $286, which is about equal to the poverty line at \nthe equivalent of $1 per day. The area includes 123 national poverty counties. In recent years, most of the Hexi Corridor in \nGansu\u2014part of the old Silk Road\u2014has been designated as natural reserve zone, or an enclosure zone, for ecological \nprotection, with stringent land use regulations being put in place. A grazing ban has been imposed by the Government and \nsome highly sloped farmland is designated for conversion back to forest and grassland; it is suitable for the establishment \nof economical fruit orchards and ecological forest. The Government considers increasing urbanization an important way to \nreduce poverty. Urban population growth is increasing rapidly, but urban employment opportunities can be scarce for \nunskilled laborers from the countryside, many of whom have minimal elementary education and are ill-equipped for the \ndemands of migration and urban living. The Project promises to create significant new job opportunities through fruit \norchard development and increased growth in service industries that derive business from tourism and other traffic along \nthe old Silk Road.  \n \nThe Project will build capacity for participatory and community-oriented ecological system restoration, and for sustainable \nland use that protects biodiversity while improving rural livelihoods.  \n \nB.

Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n \n1. Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? \n \n  The primary beneficiaries have been affected by environmental externalities associated with land degradation in western \nPRC, and include small farm households, agricultural laborers, and people who use forests for a living. The poor and the \nsocially  excluded  will  benefit  from  the  Project  through  developing  fruit  orchards  and  forest  plantations,  thereby \nenhancing their income generation prospects and improving the environmental sustainability of the area. \n \n2. What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \n  The potential needs of the beneficiaries include technical assistance and capacity building in the selection of sites and \ncultivation practices for orchard and other tree crops, financial assistance for establishing tree crops, and alternative \nincome-generating activities before orchard production begins. \n \n3. What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem? \n \n  Potential constraints include financial and credit limitations, lack of technical know-how, and land scarcity. The Project \nwill provide support to address these constraints.  \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 2  9\n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \n \nThe main stakeholders include small farm households, agricultural laborers, and forest users affected by ecosystem \ndegradation. Other stakeholders include the provincial, municipal, county, and village agencies that will be responsible for \nplanning, implementing, and evaluating the project activities. Both formal and informal consultations will be held with key \nproject stakeholders during project preparation. \n \n2.  What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, \ncommunity mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)?  \n \nWorkshops will be conducted, communities mobilized, and community-based organizations will be extensively consulted \nduring the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA.) National and local steering committees will also be actively \nconsulted during the PPTA.  \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n    Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n4.   Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program?  \n \nThere are two key gender issues: (i) women's welfare, and (ii) a lack of women participating in the community decision-\nmaking process. These gender issues are influenced by cultural factors, environmental conditions, education, and \nemployment opportunities. Traditional religious practices are common among indigenous and ethnic minority groups in \nGansu and Xinjiang UAR, and need to be taken into account. During PPTA implementation, there will be an assessment of \nwomen\u2019s roles in the proposed project activities. The need to support gender-specific community groups and other \nmeasures will be assessed. \n \n2.  Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision making?\n    Yes          No    Please explain \n \n3.  Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality?  \n    Yes          No    Please explain  \n \nThe Project is not expected to have significant negative impacts on women, but a gender plan will be developed, given that \ntraditional religious practices may adversely influence women\u2019s participation in the opportunities generated by the Project. \n \nIII.
