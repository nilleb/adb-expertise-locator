INTRODUCTION \n1.  The proposed knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will enhance the capacity \nof three developing member countries (DMCs)\u2014Fiji, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR), and Mongolia\u2014to strengthen women\u2019s resilience to climate change and disaster risks. This \nwill be done by demonstrating (i) the potential for \u201cgreen jobs\u201d for women, (ii) developing and \nadvancing gender-responsive national and sector policies and actions on climate change and \ndisaster  risk  management  (CCDRM),  and  (iii)  integrating  women\u2019s  rights  into  relevant \nenvironment law.1 The TA is included in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Management-\napproved Gender Equity Thematic Group\u2019s 2017 annual work program.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Women, and particularly poor women, suffer disproportionately from the impact of climate \nchange and disasters triggered by natural hazards. Their recovery from post-disaster shocks is \ntypically less rapid than that of men as a result of their lack of resource ownership and human \ncapital endowments, disadvantaged socioeconomic position, lack of voice in decision-making \nprocesses,  and  disproportionate  care  responsibilities.  The  same  factors  hamper  women\u2019s \nadaptive capacity and access to \u201cclimate smart\u201d technology and production inputs in agriculture, \nas well as their capacity to capture economic opportunities provided by growing \u201cgreen economy\u201d \nvalue chains. When poor households suffer from multiple climate-related hazards, they may adopt \nextreme coping actions that can lead to long-term and intergenerational vulnerability, such as \nearly marriage for girls, selling land and other assets for less than their value, withdrawing children \nfrom school, and reducing their food consumption. \n \n3.  Women play a critical role in managing climate and disaster risks through their coping \nknowledge  and  experience  in  effectively  mobilizing  resources.  However,  their roles  remain \nundervalued in climate policies and finance.  Empowering women and recognizing them as agents \nof change, rather than simply victims, and supporting their participation in CCDRM policy and \nprogram development are fundamental requirements of sustainable development. \n \n4.  The growing recognition of the centrality of gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment \nin CCDRM has resulted in a number of global initiatives, including (i) the Paris Agreement; (ii) the \nLima Programme on Gender, adopted by the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change; (iii) gender policies and action plans adopted by global climate financing \nmechanisms such as the Global Environment Facility, the Climate Investment Funds, and the \nGreen Climate Fund; (iv) Sustainable Development Goal 13.b; and (v) gender actions under the \nSendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015\u20132030). Nonetheless, there are significant \ngaps in the capacity and commitment of countries to integrate gender equality in CCDRM work. \nEven those countries that have explicitly acknowledged the vulnerability of women to climate \nchange and the impact of disasters have yet to define specific actions, work programs, and \nfinancing and implementation arrangements. Most countries find it challenging to design gender-\nresponsive  CCDRM  projects.  Key  stakeholders\u2014such  as  women\u2019s  groups  and  national \nmachinery responsible for gender equality\u2014are largely excluded from important policy and \nprogram decision making. \n                                                \n1  Green jobs are defined by the International Labour Organization as \u201cdecent jobs that contribute to preserve or restore \nthe environment, be they in traditional sectors such as manufacturing and construction, or in new, emerging green \nsectors such as renewable energy and energy efficiency.\u201d International Labour Organization. What is a Green Job? \nhttp://www.ilo.org/global/topics/green-jobs/news/WCMS_220248/lang--en/index.htm \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 29 June 2017. \n ", "2 \n5.  Although  national  environmental  laws  will  play  an  important  role  in  effectively \nimplementing national commitments to gender equality in CCDRM, little work has been done to \ncritically assess the need for and means to implement legal reforms. \n \n6.  There  is  an  unprecedented  opportunity  for  women  to  benefit  from  growing  green \neconomies, but prospects for advancement from low-skill, entry-level positions to high-skill, \nhigher-paying green jobs are hindered by existing gender inequalities. These include limited \naccess to skills training and technical and vocational education and training (TVET), lack of \nfinance, care responsibilities, limited access to assets such as land, and gender stereotypes in \nthe existing labor market that reproduce the same gender gaps in the green economy.3 Reforms \nand  demonstration  of  effective  initiatives  that  are  likely  to  accelerate  green  jobs  and \nentrepreneurship for women are urgently needed to make the green economy value chain gender-\ninclusive. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: DMC demand for investments in gender-\nresponsive CCDRM programs to achieve Sustainable Development Goals 5 and 13 increased. \nThe  TA  will  have  the  following  outcome:  capacity  of  selected  DMCs  in  developing  and \nimplementing gender-responsive CCDRM policies and programs increased.4 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n8.  Output 1: Green jobs potential for women demonstrated. This output will demonstrate \nthe importance of women\u2019s participation in the growing green economy through TVET and \nemployment opportunities, and raise awareness among governments, the private sector, and key \nstakeholders regarding this issue. It will include (i) gender analysis (supply and demand) of the \ngreen  job  sectors  (e.g.,  renewable  energy  industries,  green  construction,  environmental \nprotection, and climate-smart commercial agriculture value chain) to identify options with respect \nto skills development, leadership, entrepreneurship (including financial instruments in support of \nwomen green entrepreneurs), and policy reforms; (ii) in-country and regional roundtable forums \non green jobs to prioritize recommendations; (iii) demonstration of two prioritized small-scale \nprojects  on green jobs for  women;  (iv)  an  impact  evaluation  and final  report;  and  (v) the \ndissemination  of  findings  and  key  messages.  In  Mongolia,  the  green  jobs  demonstration \nsubproject will provide associated skills training for women through a proposed grant\u2014the \nCommunity Vegetable Farming for Livelihoods Improvement Project\u2014to improve the livelihoods \nof smallholders involved in vegetable production. This will be achieved through capacity building \ntraining on vegetable food processing in Orkhon soum (district) to create women\u2019s livelihood \nopportunities; training in food processing, packaging, labeling, and marketing; and selling into \ninclusive agriculture value chains.5 In Fiji, the green jobs demonstration subproject will teach \nwomen to build climate-friendly and disaster-resilient homes for the poor, as a form of adaptation, \nand to develop construction skills into livelihoods. There will be no green jobs demonstration \nsubproject in Lao PDR. \n                                                \n3  This TA uses the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) definition of a green economy as one \u201cthat results \nin improved human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological \nscarcities.  It  is  low  carbon,  resource  efficient  and  socially-inclusive.\u201d \nhttps://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1446 \n4  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n5  ADB. 2017.

Manila (project number: 50278-001, June). \n ", "  3 \n \n9.  Output 2: Policy advice for gender mainstreaming in climate change and disaster \nrisk management policies, strategies, and financing strengthened. This output will build the \ncapacity of the selected DMCs to make their CCDRM policies, strategies, or financing more \ngender-responsive, including through (i) institutional gender assessments of policies, strategies, \nfinance-related decision-making, and institutional structures to identify gaps, and recommend \nchanges; (ii) in-country roundtable discussions; (iii) regional exchanges among multidisciplinary \ncountry teams (e.g., CCDRM agencies, national gender machineries, and women\u2019s organizations) \nfor lateral and good-practice learning; (iv) training and capacity building of in-country climate \ndecision-makers, sector line ministry and local government staff, and other stakeholders as \nidentified  in  national  assessments  and/or  plans  (using  training  tools  developed  under  the \nHarnessing Climate Change Mitigation Initiatives to Benefit Women TA); (v) knowledge tools for \nintegrating gender-inclusive CCDRM designs in future ADB investments and accessing green \nfinance; and (vi) linking country stakeholders with key regional and global gender-climate change \nnetworks.6 The effectiveness of institutional arrangements for implementing gender-responsive \nsector policies and programs\u2014including the roles and functions of sector officials and staff\u2014will \nbe assessed to improve sector-level integration of gender issues. \n \n10.  Output 3: Legal frameworks for gender-inclusive climate change and disaster risk \nmanagement strengthened. This output will identify (i) gaps and best practices in law and legal \nframeworks to implement national policy frameworks and country commitments on gender-\nresponsive  CCDRM  in  selected  DMCs,  and  global  good  practices.  It  will  include  (i)  the \nidentification of key environmental law or legal mechanisms related to gender and CCDRM (global \nand regional); (ii) gender analysis of laws or institutional frameworks, including good practices \nand recommendations; (iii) regional stakeholder consultation, awareness raising, and preparation \nof a legal report; and (iv) the preparation of a knowledge product on legal frameworks for gender-\ninclusive CCDRM. This TA will link to the TA being implemented by the ADB Office of the General \nCounsel.7 Under this output, sector-specific good practices law will also be considered, as well as \noverall CCDRM law. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,400,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund, with $700,000 from TASF 6 and $700,000 from TASF-other \nsources. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. The TA will also support the \nproduction of five digital knowledge products. A limited number of hard copies will be printed for \nDMCs that lack widespread access to the internet (e.g., Pacific island countries). \n \n12.  The government of selected DMCs will provide counterpart support in the form of office \nspace,  access  by  national  gender  consultants  to  information  and  data,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will be the executing agency, and will administer the TA. The Gender Equity Thematic \nGroup under ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department will lead the \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2011.

The TA will be \ncompleted in the selected DMCs, although there will be no green jobs demonstration subproject \nin the Lao PDR owing to insufficient funds. The implementing agencies will be (i) in Fiji, the \nMinistry of Women and Poverty Alleviation; (ii) in the Lao PDR, the Ministry of Natural Resources \nand Environment in partnership with Lao Women\u2019s Union; and (iii) in Mongolia, the Secretariat of \nthe National Committee on Gender Equality under the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection. \n \n14.  In each country, the implementing agencies will chair the TA steering committee and will \nmeet twice per year. The TA steering committee will consist of members of government agencies \nresponsible for the environment, CCDRM, labor and employment, and law. \n \n15.  The TA activities will be implemented in coordination with other sector and thematic \ngroups including CCDRM, environment, agriculture, and finance. The TA will collaborate with \nADB\u2019s Pacific Department to publish a Pacific Islands Gender Review of Climate Change Policies. \nThe TA will be evaluated and will involve community-based organizations and women's groups. \n \n16.  In Mongolia, a demonstration green jobs subproject supporting a proposed grant project \n(Community Vegetable Farming for Livelihood Improvement) will be administered by ADB\u2019s East \nAsia Department and implemented by the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Light Industry \n(footnote 5).
