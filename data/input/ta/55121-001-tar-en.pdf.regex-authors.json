INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will initiate the implementation of \nthe Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Gender Strategy 20301 and promote \ngender equality measures and people-to-people contacts (linked to objective 3 of the CAREC \nGender Strategy 2030) under the CAREC Program. 2 The TA will apply lessons from other gender \nmainstreaming efforts by the Central and West Asia Department (CWRD).3 \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  CAREC countries face common challenges to improving the quality of life for women. In \nmost CAREC countries, women and men have equal rights under the law, including equal access \nto social services. However, gender-based disparities persist across multiple indexes4 in all \nCAREC countries, particularly in economic empowerment and political representation. These \ndisparities include (i) limited access to quality employment, as women tend to be employed in \nlower-paid and informal economic activities; (ii) challenges in implementing national policies that \npromote decent work and fair labor standards for women; and (iii) difficult access to finance for \nwomen  entrepreneurs.  Moreover,  the  digital  divide  in  and  between  member  countries \ndisproportionately affects women, and women tend to have less access to technology and the \ninternet than men. Many CAREC countries fare poorly in terms of the proportion of women in \nmanagerial positions\u2014for example, less than 10% of firms in Pakistan and Tajikistan have a \nfemale top manager.5 Women\u2019s political participation at the national level in CAREC countries \nfalls below the 33.3% advocated by the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.6 \n \n3.  In the CAREC region, women often have been disproportionally affected by external \nshocks. Not only are they expected to undertake primary care responsibility, but pre-existing \nstructural disadvantages also lead to inequality, discrimination, and the exclusion of women from \ndecision-making. This affects their ability to withstand shocks and stresses and leads to much \npoorer outcomes than for men. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had a greater \nimpact on women than men in the CAREC region. Women often work in insecure labor markets \nor the informal economy, increasing their vulnerability to economic shocks. Meanwhile, women's \nunpaid care and domestic work have increased significantly during the pandemic.  \n \n4.  CAREC countries are committed to meeting the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) on \ngender equality (SDG 5)7 and key international gender equality agreements while implementing \nthe CAREC Gender Strategy 2030. They can learn from each other to strengthen their national \napproaches to gender mainstreaming and adopt a transformative gender agenda. In addition, \n \n1  ADB. 2021.

Analysis \nindicates scarce regional networking among female entrepreneurs. Few mechanisms adequately \nsupport mainstreaming national and regional gender equality measures and dialogue or regional \ninvestment projects to uplift women. The CAREC cross-border community collaboration scoping \nstudy also identified opportunities to address problems faced by women, especially in the border \nregions, through enhanced people-to-people cooperation.8  \n \n5.  A regional approach to gender mainstreaming taken through the CAREC Gender Strategy \n2030, approved at the 19th Ministerial Conference in 2020, can complement national actions and \nexisting programs to support women\u2019s empowerment in the region. The CAREC Gender Strategy \n2030 identifies key gender issues, potential strategic directions, and entry points for gender \nmainstreaming throughout CAREC\u2019s five operational clusters. The strategy has four objectives: \n(i)  promote  women\u2019s  access  to  economic  opportunities,  (ii)  contribute  to  women\u2019s  social \nempowerment, (iii) support women\u2019s regional networks and policy reform for women\u2019s economic \nempowerment, and (iv) enhance women\u2019s access to information and communication technology. \nThis TA will primarily contribute to promoting women\u2019s access to economic opportunities and \nsupporting women\u2019s regional networks.    \n \n6.   In addition to the SDGs, the TA is aligned with three of the operational priorities of \nStrategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).9 For Operational Priority 7 (Fostering \nRegional Cooperation and Integration), this TA will strengthen the CAREC Program\u2019s role as a \nregional platform to better align gender activities through enhanced women\u2019s regional networks \nby promoting people-to-people contacts and policy coordination. It will also address Operational \nPriority 2 (Accelerating Progress in Gender Equality) by enhancing gender equality in decision-\nmaking and promoting women\u2019s economic empowerment. For Operational Priority 1 (Addressing \nRemaining Poverty and Reducing Inequalities), this TA will contribute to creating a more inclusive \nbusiness environment for women business groups and female entrepreneurs.   \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: inclusive regional economic growth in the \nCAREC  region  enhanced.10 The  TA  will  have  the  following  outcome:  gender  equality  and \nwomen\u2019s economic empowerment improved in the CAREC region.11 The outcome indicators are \n(i) two new regional mechanisms made operational for knowledge and experience sharing among \nCAREC countries on mainstreaming gender and enhancing women\u2019s economic empowerment by \n2025; (ii) 90% of CAREC countries committed to implementing the newly developed regional \ngender  action  plan  on  women\u2019s  empowerment  and  participation  in  the  selected  CAREC \noperational clusters by 2025; and (iii)  50% of newly committed CAREC projects categorized as \ngender equity theme, effective gender mainstreaming, or some gender elements by 2025. \n \n8  ADB. 2020.

Output 1: Operational mechanisms for CAREC Gender Strategy 2030 developed.   \nThe TA will support the establishment of the following four operational mechanisms: (i) a  regional \ngender expert group12 to provide strategic guidance on the CAREC Gender Strategy 2030\u2019s \neffective  implementation  and  inputs  for  gender  mainstreaming  in  the  development  and \nimplementation of CAREC-related projects; (ii) one or more regional gender action plans to \nenhance women\u2019s empowerment and participation in the selected CAREC operational clusters; \n(iii) enhanced collaboration on advancing gender equality between the CAREC Secretariat, \nmember countries, development partners, and the CAREC Institute by promoting knowledge \nsharing and mutual learning; and (iv)  a monitoring and evaluation mechanism, which will facilitate \ntracking  and  communication  of  the  strategy\u2019s  implementation  across  the  region.  A  gender \ndatabase\u2014one of the monitoring and evaluation tools\u2014will be developed and used to track and \nmonitor the results of the CAREC Gender Strategy 2030, inform the gender-sensitive and gender-\nresponsive  design  of  CAREC  investments,  and  help  countries  improve  their  policies  and \nstrategies for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. The database will be managed and \nmaintained  by  the  CAREC  Secretariat.  These  mechanisms  will  be  supported  by  improved \nnetworking and collaboration among government agencies, development partners, the private \nsector, country-level women\u2019s business groups, nongovernment organizations, and civil society \norganizations through a series of workshops, policy dialogues, and knowledge events.  \n \n9.  Output 2: Regional cooperation and integration projects for women\u2019s economic \nempowerment  in  the  CAREC  region  developed.  The  TA  aims  to  generate  investment \nopportunities  for  women  and  women-led  businesses  by  identifying  economic  opportunities, \ngenerating  innovative  ideas,  piloting  activities,  and  developing  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration projects focusing on women\u2019s economic empowerment. The projects can include (i) \nsupport for regulatory reforms13 by setting harmonized employment standards for increased \naccess to decent work14 for women and men in the selected CAREC sector such as transport, \nenergy,15 agriculture and water, human capital development, and trade or tourism; (ii) promoting \nwomen\u2019s participation in regional and cross-border projects and activities; (iii) increasing women \nentrepreneurs\u2019 access to relevant business training and trade finance; and (iv) improving women\u2019s \naccess  to  digital  technologies  and  e-commerce  platforms.  The  TA  will  conduct  several \nconsultations with gender experts, women and men engaged in the relevant businesses, and \npolicymakers. The TA will also conduct a study on selected operational clusters of the CAREC \nProgram, which will help design concrete and targeted regional cooperation and integration \nprojects for women\u2019s economic empowerment. This output will contribute to increasing women\u2019s \naccess to jobs and business opportunities in CAREC sectors. A free electronic version of the TA \nknowledge outputs will be available to the public and will only be printed if requested by key \nstakeholders. \n \n \n12 The regional gender expert group will comprise representatives from all CAREC member countries, interested \ndevelopment partners, representatives from national and international civil society and international nongovernment \norganizations.  \n13  Regional and/or country-level policies, institutional arrangements can be reviewed and considered.  \n14  The International Labor Organization defines decent work as \u201cproductive work for women and men in conditions of \nfreedom, equity, security and human dignity\u201d (International Labor Organization. 2012. Gender Equality and Decent \nWork. Geneva.). Decent work is also linked with SDG 8: \u201cPromote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic \ngrowth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.\u201d \n15  The CAREC Energy Strategy 2030 has a strong focus on gender and foresees the establishment of a dedicated \nWomen in Energy Program to make women more employable and improve their career opportunities in the sector. \nADB. 2019. CAREC Energy Strategy 2030: Common Borders. Common Solutions. Common Energy Future. Manila. \n \n ", "4 \n10.  Output 3: CAREC People\u2019s Forum conducted. The TA will support the establishment \nof a CAREC People\u2019s Forum\u2014virtual and physical, when possible\u2014to foster regional networks \nfor women\u2019s economic empowerment and to enhance business-to-business contacts, support \nentrepreneurship, and harness business opportunities. The aim is for the forum to become an \neffective  mechanism  to  engage  various  actors  and  strengthen  their  role  in  economic \nempowerment of women in CAREC countries. These actors may include national chambers of \ncommerce; other civil society organizations; micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises; startups \nled by women; and country-level women\u2019s machineries16. Moreover, it will provide an open space \nfor the participants, particularly women entrepreneurs and women-led businesses, to network with \npeers, development partners, governments, and other stakeholders in various formats such as \njob fairs and regional expos\u2014providing participants with the opportunity for education, business \nopportunities, and mentorship. This forum will kickstart the implementation of the CAREC Gender \nStrategy 2030 by supporting its objectives 1 and 3, and will thereafter include other issues of \nrelevance. After the TA completion, the CAREC Secretariat will maintain and continue operating \nthis platform.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which (i) $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7), and (ii) $700,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund.17 The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB will administer the TA. The Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination \nDivision  of CWRD  will  implement  the  TA  in  close  coordination  with  the  Portfolio,  Results, \nSafeguards and Gender Unit and its country network will provide expertise on gender issues for \nthe effective delivery of the outputs of this TA, as well as sector divisions and resident missions \nof CWRD and the East Asia Department, the Sustainable Development and Climate Change \nDepartment\u2019s Gender Thematic Group, and government counterparts. The CAREC Secretariat in \nthe Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination Division will provide operational and \nprogrammatic coordination for TA implementation and create synergies with other relevant TA \nprojects and activities.18  \n   \n \n16 National Women\u2019s Machineries are key institutional mechanisms for the advancement of women and play a critical \nrole in promoting and ensuring implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination \nagainst Women and the Beijing Platform for Action at the national level.
