I submit to the Board of Directors, for its consideration and\ndecision, the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan from\nthe ordinary capital resources (OCR) of the Bank in an amount in various\ncurrencies equivalent to $267 million applied for by India for the Gandhar\nField Development Project. The loan will have a term of 20 years,\nincluding a grace period of 4 years, an interest rate determined in\naccordance with the Bank's pool-based variable lending rate system, and\na commitment charge of 0.75 per cent per annum. This report also\ndescribes two technical assistance (TA) grants in a total amount of $1.07\nmillion, applied for by the Government.\n2. In September 1990 the Government requested Bank assistance for\nthe proposed Project. TA was approved in November 1990 V for the purpose\nof undertaking a review of the policies, operations and institutions\nassociated with the hydrocarbon sector. A Fact-Finding Mission visited\nIndia in January 1991. The Appraisal Mission visited India from 8 to 28\nMay 1991 and confirmed the Project's priority and suitability for Bank\nfinancing. Loan negotiations were held in Manila from 16 to 19 October\n1991 with the authorized representatives of the Borrower and the\nGuarantor. If approved, the proposed loan will be the Bank's seventeenth\nloan to India and the second in the oil and gas sector.\nI. THE ECONOMY\n3. A Board Information Paper, \"Economic Review and Bank\nOperations\" (EBO:IND 91014), was circulated in August 1991 (IN. 163-91).\nA.\t Energy Sector\n4. Commercial energy sources comprising coal, oil, natural gas,\nhydropower and nuclear power provide about 60 per cent of the total energy\nconsumed in India, while noncommercial sources such as firewood, other\nplant materials and biomass meet the rest of the energy demand. Between\nFY1986 and FY1990, the pattern of commercial energy consumption changed,\nwith a small shift to natural gas and a small reduction in the percentage\nshare of coal in the energy mix. Coal, however, continued to be the main\nfuel source in FY199O, providing about 51 per cent of primary commercial\nenergy consumption, followed by oil (31 per cent), natural gas (5 per\ncent), hydropower (12 per cent) and nuclear power (1 per cent). Over 60\nper cent of the commercial energy supply is consumed by the industry,\ntransport and agriculture sectors, In FY1990 the industry sector consumed\nabout 47 per cent; transport, 25 per cent; agriculture, 3 per cent; and\n1 TA No 1416: Review of Hydrocarbon Sector Operations, for $100,000, approved\n8 November 1990.", "the household sector, about 14 per cent. The balance of 11 per cent was\nconsumed by other sectors of the economy.\n5. In terms of energy resource endowment, India has substantial\nreserves of coal, oil, natural gas and hydropower. Current known reserves\nof coal and lignite are estimated at about 48.6 billion tons; oil, 558\nmillion tons; and natural gas 500 billion cubic meters (BCM). Hydro-\nelectric potential is estimated at 90,000 megawatts (MW). In FY1990 India\nproduced 201 million tons of coal, 34 million tons of oil, 9 BCM of gas11\nand 62 million kilowatt-hours of hydroelectricity. Despite these\nsignificant increases in indigenous energy- production, the pace of\nexploitation of India's domestic energy resources remains relatively low.\nIt is estimated that coal reserves could last over 200 years, oil reserves\nabout 16 years and gas about 30 years at the current rates of extraction.\nThe potential for proving additional reserves of oil and for increasing\ngas production appears to be promising.\n6. The scarcity of electric power, coal and natural gas supplies\nremains a key constraint to accelerating the rate of industrialization in\nIndia and continues to prevent the full utilization of installed\nindustrial production capacity. To cover oil supply shortfalls, oil and\noil products have had to be imported in increasing quantities and at\nincreasing costs. Between FY1986 and FY1990, India's oil and oil product\nimports increased by 17.5 per cent a year to reach 23.9 million tons,\nwhile the cost of such imports increased annually by 3 per cent to $3.3\nbillion. The gap between energy demand and supply is projected by the\nGovernment to widen to about 47 million tons of oil equivalent by the year\n2000. Such shortfalls will have to be met by costly imports which will\ncontinue to place a heavy burden on the economy. Continued efforts need\nto be made by the Government to strengthen its energy strategy, to manage\ndemand more effectively and to augment domestic supply through appropriate\npolicy initiatives and investments.\nB.\t Sector Policies and Strategies\n7. In designing its energy strategy, the Government has emphasized\nthe development of indigenous energy resources and the overcoming of\nenergy supply and distribution constraints. This has involved the\nallocation of a large share of investible resources for the development\nof hydrocarbons, the expansion of coal-based and gas-based thermal power\nplants, the establishment of domestic refining capacity and the\nmechanization of open cast coal mines. Budget allocations for the energy\nsector in the Seventh Five-Year Plan (FY1986-FY1990) reached about $25\nbillion equivalent or about 29 per cent of the total Plan outlay. The\nEighth Plan which has been delayed but which is expected to cover the\nperiod FY1993-FY1998, will likely continue energy allocations above this\nlevel. Of the total energy allocation under the Seventh Plan, about $5.5\nbillion was expended on oil and gas activities (exploration, production,\ninfrastructure), while indications are that the Eighth Plan will provide\nfor an allocation of about $7.7 billion.\nInclusive of flared gas, total gas production was 17 BCM.", "8. tn the context of the urgent need to reduce energy shortages and\nrelieve the pressure on the budget, the Government has been moving\nincreasingly over the past three to four years toward (i) ensuring full\ncost recovery in the setting of prices for the energy sector;\n(ii) enhanced private sector involvement in the development of the energy\nsector; and (iii) increasing emphasis on energy conservation and energy\nefficiency.\n9. These strategies certainly have applicability to the oil and gas\nsector as well. Since the early 1970s, with the discoveries in the Bombay\nHigh offshore field, India has been able substantially to reduce its\nreliance on oil imports. However, production from this field levelled\noff around 1985. The achievement of even current levels of petroleum\nself-sufficiency through the l990s implies heavy investments in enhanced\noil recovery and in new exploration, accelerated development of hitherto\nunexploited fields and substitution of natural gas for oil products within\nthe domestic energy demand mix. While Government strategies appear to\nassume large additional discoveries in the next few years as well as\nfaster development of existing reserves, the likely investment resource\nconstraints suggest that efforts to provide for more efficient use of\nenergy and substitution of oil products with other indigenous energy\nresources may provide a more likely avenue for maximizing the availability\nof hydrocarbon resources in the energy sector.\nC.\t External Assistance to the Oil and Gas Sector\n10. The World Bank has provided the largest amount of external\nassistance to the oil and gas sector in India, with approval of 11 loans\ntotalling about $2.8 billion since the first loan was provided in 1977.\nThe most recent loan of $150 million for the Oil and Gas Sector\nDevelopment Project was made in July 1991. The World Bank has been\nencouraging rapid development of the sector to replace imported petroleum\nproducts, promoting economically based pricing policies and encouraging\nthe use of gas for power and industrial applications. The Bank is a more\nrecent participant in the sector and has been closely coordinating its\nactivities with those of the World Bank to achieve complementarity of\ntheir assistance programs and a uniformity of approach on policy issues,\ndialogue and conditionalities. Further aid has been provided by Canada,\nJapan and France. Canada has provided lines of credit totalling about\nCan$340 million; Japan has assisted with V 72 billion while France has\nprovided F 624 million (for details see the Appendix). The Bank provided\nits first assistance to the sector in the form of a Special Assistance\nloan in l99lV to increase the availability of diesel fuel for industry and\ntransportation in the face of shortages arising from the Gulf crisis.\nLoan No. 1081: Special Assistance, for $150 million, approved 4 April 1991.", "4\nII BANK OPERATIONS IN INDIA\nA.\t Past Operations\n11. A Board Information Paper on the Bank's operations in India\n(EBO:IND 91014) was circulated to the Board of Directors in August 1991\n(IN. 163-91).\nB.\t Oterational Strategy\n12. Since beginning India operations in 1986, the Bank's operational\nstrategy has focused on the industrialization of the economy, one of the\nGovernment's most important objectives. Bank assistance is targeted at\nimproving the structure of industry and making more efficient use of\nproductive capacity, and at easing infrastructure bottlenecks to the\ngrowth of industry. A detailed review of the Bank's operational strategy\nundertaken in 1989/1990 reconfirmed this strategy.\n13. As a result of various developments that have taken place in the\nindustry and transport sectors (as well as in the modernization of\nagriculture), the pattern of energy consumption has changed over time\ntowards reliance on commercial sources. In fact, the kind of development\npath chosen by India - - with its emphasis on heavy and basic industries\nand on self-reliance - - has been relatively energy-intensive with respect\nto commercial sources, partly in response to the inherently energy-\nintensive characteristics of most heavy industries, and partly as a result\nof widespread inefficiencies in energy use. Economic progress in India,\ntherefore, is heavily dependent on commercial energy developments. Since\nthe mid-l97Os the production of oil and natural gas has trebled. However,\ndespite increases in energy output (including electric power and coal as\nwell as oil and gas), shortages and variable quality of energy supply\nremain widespread and this has constrained both industrial growth and\ngenerally economic growth. If the pace of economic growth is to be\nstepped up in the coming years, and if the industry sector is expected to\nremain the main engine of that growth, ways have to be found to reduce\nshortages and poor quality by increasing energy capacity and/or improving\nefficiency in energy use. Natural gas constitutes more than 50 per cent\nof India's hydrocarbon resources. However, gas development is in its\nearly stages, and gas resources are still very much underutilized. As a\ngenerator of power, it is more efficient and much cleaner than coal. It\nhas wide applicability as an industrial feedstock (for example, in\nfertilizer production). For oil, the situation is less certain; oil\nproduction in recent years has outstripped new discoveries but has\nstabilized. Hence, domestic oil supply increases in the future will\ndepend on the success of new exploration.\n14. In the context of formulating the Special Assistance Proj ectV\nin early 1991, the Bank identified a number of oil and gas sector issues,\nincluding pricing, private sector involvement, conservation, and\nenvironmental protection, and began an intensive dialogue with the\n' Loan No. 1081-IND:\t Special Assistance Loan, $150 million, approved on\n4 April 1991.", "5\nGovernment on these issues. There was general agreement between the\nGovernment and the Bank on the nature and scope of these issues, on\nobjectives and strategies for dealing with them and on the usefulness of\ncontinuing the dialogue in support of the Bank's planned and growing\ninvolvement in the oil and gas sector. Necessary sector reforms will\ncontinue to be addressed in the context of an expected expansion of Bank\ninvolvement in the oil and gas sector.\nC.\t Bank Assistance to the Energy Sector\n15. The Bank's program of assistance for the energy sector has, to\ndate, involved the provision of four loans for electricity projects,11 and\none Special Assistance Loan to finance diesel inputs in response to the\nurgent needs of the 1990/1991 Gulf crisis. The Bank also sanctioned TA\nto undertake a review of hydrocarbon sector operations to prepare the\ngroundwork for further Bank operations in the sector, including the\nproposed loan, and to help support policy dialogue.\nIII. THE PROJECT\n16. A Report entitled \"Appraisal of the Gandhar Field Development\nProject in India\" (Report No. LAP:IND 25020) is circulated herewith.\nA.\t Objectives\n17. The main objective of the Project is to carry out the second\nphase of a two-phase program for development of the Gandhar field so as\nto increase domestic oil and gas production and to substitute equivalent\nimports. The Project will thereby assist India's industrial development\nby freeing up scarce foreign exchange for imports of other needed\nindustrial inputs. It will provide additional petroleum-based industrial\nfeedstocks and fuels that are more efficient and environmentally safer\nthan coal. The Project is fully in conformity with the Bank's operational\nstrategy for India.\n\t\nB Scope\n18. The proposed Project comprises:\n(i) drilling of oil, gas, and water and gas injection wells;\n(ii) workover of wells;\n, Loan No. 798-IND: North Madras Thermal Power Project, $150 million, approved\n18 November 1986.\nLoan No. 907-IND: Unchahar Thermal Power Extension Project, $160 million,\napproved 29 September 1988.\nLoan No. 988-IND: Rayalaseema Thermal Power Project, $230 million, approved\n21 November 1989\nLoan No. 1029-IND: Second North Madras Thermal Power Project, $200 million,\napproved 30 August 1990.", "6\n(iii) installation of surface facilities for oil and gas\nproduction;\n(iv) construction of facilities for formation water treatment,\nand for water and gas injection, as well as utility and\noffsite facilities;\n(v) safety and environmental control facilities for the\nProject;\n(vi) consulting services for Project implementation; and\n(vii) training for personnel of the Executing Agency.\nThe project involves the drilling of 216 oil, gas, and water and\ngas injection wells and the workover of 125 wells. In terms of well\ncompletions, the Project will involve 137 oil producers, 37 gas producers,\n120 water injectors and 12 gas injectors.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n19. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $710 million\nequivalent (inclusive of taxes and duties). The foreign currency cost is\n$321 million (45 per cent), including $37.6 million for interest and other\ncharges during construction; the local currency cost is $389 million\nequivalent (55 per cent). The cost estimates include provisions for\nphysical contingencies and price escalation and have been estimated using\n1991 market prices.\n20. It is proposed that the Bank provide from its ordinary capital\nresources a loan of $267 million equivalent (37.6 per cent of total\nProject cost) to finance a part of the foreign exchange cost of the\nProject. Interest on the loan will be determined in accordance with the\nBank's pool-based variable lending rate system, with a commitment charge\nof 0.75 per cent per annum. The loan will be repaid over a period of 20\nyears, including a grace period of 4 years. These terms take into account\nthe economic life of the Project facilities and equipment and the Project\nimplementation period. The Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONCC) will be\nthe borrower of the proposed loan and India will be the Guarantor. ONGC\nwill bear the foreign exchange and interest rate risks. ONGC has provided\n$6.4 million for foreign costs and will provide $389.0 million equivalent\nfor local costs. The Government and 014CC have requested the Bank to\nassist in arranging commercial co-financing of $33.2 million for foreign\ncurrency costs under the Bank's Complementary Financing Scheme. In the\nevent that commercial co-financing is unavailable, ONGC has given\nassurance that it will provide funds from its own resources. The World\nBank has already financed initial equipment and material costs under the\nProject costing $14.4 million out of the loan savings under its ongoing\nWestern Gas Development Project (see Appendix).", "D.\t Executing Agency\n(1) History and Organization\n21. The ONGC will be the Executing Agency for the Project. ONGC,\nwhich comes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Petroleum and\nNatural Gas (MPNG), is a wholly Government-owned statutory body. It was\nestablished under the Oil and atura1 Gas Commission Act of 1959 to plan,\npromote, organize and implement programs for the development of oil and\nnatural gas resources and the production and sale of oil and natural gas\nproducts. It began commercial operations in 1960. With a total staff of\n48,000 including 12,000 engineers, geoscientists and technical officers,\nit has gained substantial experience and expertise since its inception,\nincluding the management of four World Bank-financed projects. ONCC is\nmanaged by a Commission made up ofa Chairman, six full-time Members from\nwithin the organization and two part-time Members from outside the\norganization to represent the interests of other Government agencies. The\nCommission sets its own policies, carries out its own operations and\nprepares its own capital investments. It has the authority to sanction\nprojects up to a value of Rs 500 million (about $19 million equivalent).\nIt has six regional centers, all of which are managed as profit centers\nof their own. In addition, it has eight management and research\ninstitutes, which carry out work in such fields as reservoir studies, oil\nand gas production technology, safety and environment management,\ngeotechnics, drilling technology and management development.\n22. The ONGC recognizes the need to assess its corporate strategy\nto ensure that it can sustain rapid growth without suffering the\ndiseconomies of size, and continue to improve its efficiency. ONGC has\nagreed to prepare by March 1992 a plan for commercial operations for\ndiscussion with the Bank. The plan will provide for, inter alia, greater\nautonomy for the regional centers, disengaging ONGC from activities that\nare more suitable for the private sector and setting up a cell within ONGC\nto promote private sector involvement in the development of oil and gas\nfields belonging tp ONGC. The Government has also recently reached a\ndecision to allow national companies such as ONGC to enter into joint\nventures for development of their existing oil fields. ONGC has already\nsuccessfully completed four substantial projects financed by the World\nBank, and has.done so with minimum delay. ONGC is a mature organization\nand has become one of the larger, more profitable public enterprises in\nIndia. It is accordingly deemed to be a suitable executing agency for\nthis Project.\n(2) Financial Performance\n23. The ONGC enjoys sound financial health and shows a continuing\nstrong financial performance. ONGC benefits in this regard from\nGovernment pricing and taxation policies, which provide adequate operating\nmargins for oil and gas producers. In FY1991 ONCC earned a net income of\nRs 8,7 billion (about $335 million). In recent years the price at the\nwellhead, which is set by the Government in rupee terms, has declined in\ndollar terms from a high of $19 per barrel in FY1987 to $12 per barrel\ncurrently; mainly because of the recent substantial devaluation of the\nrupee. Despite the devaluation and increasing taxes on wellhead prices,", "3\nONGC has been consistently able to finance all of its Local capital.\nrequirements from internal. cash generation. However, Or'GC's rate of\nreturn declined from 68.1 per cent in FY1987 to 29.5 per cent in FY1991\nbecause of rising operating expenses in the face of fixed prices for oil\nand gas (in rupee terms). Also, ONGC has substantially increased Long-\nterm foreign borrowings over the past few years, and by the end of VY1991\nwill bear the foreign exchange risk on about 80 per cent of its long-term\ndebt of Rs 67 billion (about $2.6 billion).\n24. During the period FY1987-FYl99l ONCC's annual returns on net\nfixed assets ranged from 29.5 to 68.1 per cent, self-financing ratios were\n65-122 per cent, and debt-service ratios were 1.5-5.4 (times). Similarly,\nprojections for FY1992-F'Y1995 indicate returns on net fixed assets ranging\nfrom 19.8-25.8 per cent, self-financing ratios from 35 to 65 per cent and\ndebt-service ratios from 1.9 to 2.8 (times). These projections have been\nprepared based on the following assumptions: (i) ONGC's annual oil and\ngas production will increase to 43.5 million tons and 20.5 BCM,\nrespectively by FY1995; (ii) the gas price will increase by Rs 100 per\n1,000 cubic meters for FY1993 and FY1994; and (iii) ONGC will incur\ncapital expenditures of Rs 240 billion (about $9.2 billion) over the next\nfour years, of which 50 per cent is envisaged to be in foreign currency.\nThese projections indicate that ONGC's financial position will remain\nfinancially sound. Over the next five years, ONGC's foreign currency\nrequirements will be substantial, estimated at $8.4 billion. In the\nimmediate future, the biggest challenge facing ONCC is to secure the\nnecessary foreign exchange financing for its high priority projects.\nGiven India's present balance-of-payments and debt-service situation, ONOC\nwill have to increasingly devote its efforts toward securing assistance\nfrom multilateral and bilateral sources as well as suppliers and export\ncredit agencies to raise the required foreign exchange to finance its\nprojects. For the next several years, it may be difficult for ONGC to\nraise the required foreign exchange from the international commercial\nmarkets on its own.\n25. To ensure its continued sound financial performance, ONCC has\nagreed to maintain at all times a debt-service ratio of not less than\n1.5:1, a debt/equity ratio of not higher than 60:40 and self-financing\nratio of not less than 35 per cent for FY1992-FY1994 inclusive and not\nless than 40 per cent from FY1995 onward.\nE.\t Implementation\n26.\t The Project is expected to be implemented over a four-year\nperiod with scheduled completion by 31 March 1995. ONGC has already\nestablished a Project Office headed by a Project Manager. Other senior\nofficials of the Project Office include a financial manager, a materials\nmanager and two project engineers. The Project Office will be responsible\nfor the financial, technical and administrative control of the Project and\nits proper execution.\nF.\t Procurement\n27.\t Procurement of equipment and materials financed by the Bank will\nbe undertaken in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement and", "9\nwill be on the basis of either international competitive bidding (ICB) or\ninternational shopping, depending on contract size. Contract services\nfor drilling and workover to be financed under the Bank Loan will be\nprocured through ICB among firms providing such specialized services.\nThe surface utility and offsite facilities will he procured on a turnkey\nbasis in accordance with LCB procedures. Each bidder for such contracts\nwill be asked to provide detailed design and equipment to carry our\nconstruction .mnd commissioning of the facilities and to furnish a\nguarantee of performance. The items being financed through Local currency\nfunds under the Project will be procured through ONGC's local competitive\nbidding procedures. Advance procurement and retroactive financing have\npreviously been approved in relation to drilling and production equipment\nand for hiring of rigs for drilling and workover.\nC.\t Consultants and Training\n(1) Consultants\n28. International consultants with expertise in corrosion\nengineering, horizontal well drilling, production engineering, and water\nand gas injection operation will be required to assist ONGC to ensure that\nthe Gandhar field is developed and managed in an optimal manner. These\nconsultants will be recruited by QNGC in accordance with the Bank's\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. The Danish Government is\nconsidering grant financing of about $1.0 million to finance these\nconsulting services. In the event such financing materializes, then the\nappropriate portion of the Bank loan will be cancelled at the request of\nIndia. ONGC has engaged domestic engineering consultants to carry out\ndetailed engineering design and preparation of the bidding documents for\nthe formation water treatment plant and the surface, utility and offsite\nfacilities, and to assist it in the evaluation of bids and supervision of\nthe construction and commissioning of these facilities. The cost of such\nservices will be borne by ONGC. The Mission has examined the engineering\narrangements and is satisfied that the selected domestic consultant has\nthe experience and.capability to perform such services.\n(2) Training\n29. The ONGC proposes to train its personnel for the Project in\noverseas facilities employing similar technologies for oil and gas\nproduction, and in India by engaging trainers to conduct relevant courses\nand seminars. The overseas training will be for engineers, middle\nmanagers and higher level staff and will cover a number of areas including\nmanagement, technical, procurement, environmental and safety activities.\nONGC will make suitable arrangements for return of staff to work at ONGC\nafter training abroad. The Danish Government may be prepared to provide\ngrant financing of about $1.5 million for this training program. In the\nevent that such financing materializes, the appropriate portion of the\nBank loan will be cancelled at the request of India.\nH.\t Reports. Accounts and Audit\n30.\t The ONGC will prepare and submit to the Bank quarterly progress\nreports on Project execution.\t ONCC will maintain separate Project", "10\naccounts, and related financial statements, and will have these audited\nannually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. Unaudited\naccounts and related financial statements will be furnished to the Bank\nwithin six months, and audited accounts within nine months of the end of\neach fiscal year. A Project completion report will be submitted within\nsix months of Project completion.\nI.\t Maintenance of Project Facilities\n31. The ONGC will be responsible for the operation and maintenance\nof Project facilities. Given its long experience in this regard, no\nparticular difficulties are foreseen.\nJ.\t Environment and Energy\n32. An environment impact assessment (EIA) for the Project was\ncompleted by the National Environment Engineering Research Institute of\nIndia, which has examined all the proposed arrangements for treatment and\ndisposal of solid wastes, liquid effluents and gaseous emissions. Based\non this EIA, the Project was approved by the Gujarat Pollution Control\nCommission in August 1990 and by the Department of Environment and Forests\nat the federal level in January 1991. The arrangement for handling solid\nwastes, liquid effluents and gaseous emissions from the Project has been\nfound satisfactory by the Bank. Solid wastes will be used for land\nfilling and erection of flood control bunds to protect the wells.\nFormation water effluents will be reinjected into the wells to maintain\nwell pressure in accordance with international petroleum industry\nstandards in this regard. Gaseous emissions will be flared and, since\ngases produced from the Gandhar field contain less than 3 per cent carbon\ndioxide and only trace amounts of sulfur, there will be no significant\nenvironmental impact from this procedure. To continually improve the\nenvironmental and safety management of its activities, ONGC has requested\nTA for this purpose (para. 43(1)).\n33. As regards energy issues, the Project facilities will utilize\nup-to-date techniques and will be designed to operate with high energy\nefficiency and produce substantial energy savings. The energy from the\nhigh-pressure oil and gas in the wells will be used to deliver the oil and\ngas through the processing facilities and then to storage or to end-\nconsumers without the use of process pumps for oil and with relatively low\ncompression for gas.\nK.\t Specific Assurances\n34.\t In addition to the standard provisions and loan covenants, the\nfollowing specific assurances have been obtained:\n(i) The Government will periodically review the existing oil pricing\nsystem and adjust the overall prices of oil products from time\nto time to achieve full cost recovery from the end-consumers and\nto reflect international prices at the consumer level, to allow\nthe operating entities to operate on a sound financial basis and\nto mobilize adequate resources from the oil and gas sector.", "11\n(ii) The Government will continue to aim for full fuel oil parity\nand to provide an adequate return for producers, in setting gas\nprices.\n(iii) The Government will undertake its program of regular exploration\nofferings in the future.\n(iv) ONGC will prepare by March 1992 a plan for commercialization and\nefficiency improvements and discuss with the Bank its subsequent\naction (see paragraph 22).\n(v) ONGC will maintain satisfactory debt/equity and debt-service and\nself-financing ratios and an adequate return.\n(vi) ONGC will ensure that (a) that all Project facilities will be\ndesigned and installed in accordance with industry safety\nstandards and (b) environmental controls and safety devices will\nbe included in the design of all Project facilities and that\nsuch controls will thereafter be maintained in good condition\nand effectively utilized.\nL.\t Policy Aspects\n35. The main issue relating to the energy sector is the widening gap\nbetween energy supply and demand. Until recent years, the Government's\nstrategy for dealing with this fundamental problem was to encourage the\nincreasing development of indigenous supply. This involved the allocation\nof a large share of investible resources to the development of\nhydrocarbons, the expansion of oil-based and gas-based thermal power\nplants, the establishment of a domestic refining capacity and the\nmechanization of open-cast coal mines. Faced with energy demand shortages\nand budgetary constraints, the Government has increasingly pursued other\noptions, including (i) adoption of suitable pricing policies for the\nenergy sector, (ii) enhanced private sector involvement in the energy\nsector, and (iii) increasing emphasis on energy conservation and energy\nefficiency.\n(i) Pricing\n36. Oil prices are set by the Government with a view to recovery of\nsupply costs from consumers, providing an adequate return to producers to\nenable them to maintain financial viability, and mobilizing resources for\nthe economy. Domestic prices of oil products have therefore been kept\nsubstantially above world prices. Increased costs have been quickly\npassed along to end-consumers; this was particularly evident in 1990 and\n1991 when oil product prices were subject to major increases mainly in\nresponse to the Gulf crisis and to the substantial devaluation of the\nrupee in July 1991. As far as producer prices are concerned, the two main\nproducers, ONGC and Oil India Limited (OIL), have recently seen an erosion\nof their margins. These entities are paid at fixed prices in rupee terms\n(currently set at Rs 2,235 per ton). The price in dollar terms has\ndeclined from $19 per barrel equivalent in FY1986 to $12 per barrel\ncurrently because of the fall of rupee over the past several years and its\nrecent sharp depreciation. The net price retained by the producers is now", "12\nabout $5.3 per barrel as against production costs of about $2 (Gandhar\nField). This is still deemed to he reasonable and does not yet adversely\naffect the financial position of ONGC or OIL. However, the Government has\nset up an Oil Pricing Review Committee to review the net margins of oil\nproducers, refiners and marketers and will submit recommendations by March\n1992. The Bank will he allowed to provide prior views on these\nrecommendations and will continue a dialogue with the Indian authorities\non these issues. As regards gas, it was historically provided to\nconsumers on a cost-plus basis, but in response to large finds in recent\nyears, the Government has sought to apply replacement pricing. To assist\nin implementing new pricing regimes the Government created a Gas Pricing\nCommittee (Kelkar Committee) in 1988 to recommend appropriate pricing\npolicies, and the committee made its recommendations, which were adopted\nby the Government, in May 1991 for implementation by July 1991.\nBasically, the recommendations provide for producer prices to be based on\nlong-run average production costs from certain domestic fields sufficient\nto enable producers to earn a 15 per cent rate of return on investment\nafter recommended price increases are implemented. Consumer prices are\nto be based on the economic supply cost of marginal replacement fuel. The\ndifference between consumer and producer prices is to be credited to a gas\npool account maintained by MPNG and used to assist the development of gas\nsupply infrastructure. The Bank will continue dialogue with the\nGovernment on gas pricing to encourage movement towards a mechanism\nwhereby prices would be differentiated by category of consumer in relation\nto alternative fuels displaced (such as kerosene for households and diesel\nfor commercial users).\n(ii) Private Sector Involvement\n37. As regards the role of the private sector, the Government\nrecognizes that the public sector alone cannot undertake and finance all\nthe investments needed for the accelerated development of the energy\nsector. The Government has therefore begun to systematically encourage\nadditional private sector involvement in the oil and gas industry (and in\nthe power sector as well) not only to bridge the resource gap but also to\nobtain appropriate technology for the accelerated development of the\nsector. Over the past few years, private sector companies have become\nincreasingly involved in providing goods and services to the oil and gas\nindustry and in participating in joint ventures to supply technical oil\nfield services and equipment. There has also been an emphasis by the\nGovernment on reducing its formerly exclusive role in financing capital\ninvestments in the oil and gas industry. For example, ONGC has reduced\nrig acquisition programs by about 50 per cent in favor of hiring drilling\nrigs from the private sector. At present about 70 per cent of well\nservices in offshore areas and 30 per cent in onshore areas are performed\nby private sector companies. The value of private sector services\ncontracted by ONGC rose from $48.8 million in F'Y1981 to over $380 million\nin FY199O. Recently the Government has decided to allow ONGC to enter\ninto joint-ventures for the development of its existing fields and\nmodalities are currently being worked out by ONGC.\n38. With regard to oil and gas exploration and production, the\nGovernment had through May 1991 made three rounds of exploration offerings\nto the private sector with increasingly improved terms and conditions to", "13\nensure a favorable response. By the third round the terms and conditions\nwere found to be competitive with those offered by other countries with\nsimilar prospects for oil and gas discovery. The Government announced in\nJuly 1991 a fourth round of exploration offerings with incentives\nsufficient to attract substantial interest from the private sector. The\nGovernment has also assured that (i) it intends to continue its program\nof regular exploration offerings in the future, (ii) oil produced by\nprivate companies will be purchased at prevailing international prices,\n(iii) gas produced by the private sector will be purchased at prices that\nensure full cost recovery plus an adequate return to the producers and\nwill be equal to but not exceeding that available to public sector\ncompanies. In another area, the Government has indicated that it will\nextend the use of open competitive bidding procedures to enable private\nsector companies to acquire urban gas distribution franchises. In the\ncase of refineries, the Government has decided, whenever feasible, not to\ncommit public funds for the full financing of new refineries, but rather\nto seek joint-venture private partners to develop new refinery projects.\n(iii) Energy Conservation\n39. As part of the Government's strategy to minimize the energy\nsupply/demand gap, increasing emphasis has been placed on energy\nconservation. The most important recent initiative in this regard was the\npreparation in 1991 of an Action Plan on Energy Conservation (APENCON)\ndesigned to accomplish the following: (i) prepare energy audits,\nthroughout the country, of heat-generating equipment (boilers, furnaces,\nkilns) for the private sector and public sector and for thermal power\nplants with capacities exceeding 20 MW; (ii) strengthen local institutes\nand private sector consulting firms engaged in energy conservation work;\n(iii) introduce appropriate regulations for mandatory energy audits and\nenergy-use reporting; (iv) prepare a plan to support marketing of energy-\nefficient heating equipment and electrical appliances; and (v) set up\nenergy conservation funds or other financing facilities in various\ndevelopment finance institutions. APENCON specifies targets and\nobjectives, firms up appropriate implementation arrangements and provides\nan estimate of the resource requirements for the completion of all covered\nactivities. The Government provided APENCON to the Bank in July 1991.\nThis is now being examined by the Bank to assess the areas where the Bank\ncould assist the Government in implementing appropriate energy\nconservation programs. In addition to APENCON, the Government plans to\nimplement (1) industrial energy efficiency and modernization projects to\nconserve energy and improve efficiency in the highly energy-intensive\nindustry sector, (ii) refinery energy conservation projects to improve\nthe efficient use of energy in the refineries, and (iii) gas flaring\nreduction projects to eliminate flaring of gas from existing fields. The\nBank is already considering proposals for assistance under its future\nprogram in all three areas.\n40. All of the above strategies and policies have been included in\na statement on Government Policies and Strategies (GPS) in the energy\nsector, which was provided by the Government to the Bank in February 1991\nin the course of processing the Special Assistance Project (see footnote,\npage 4). This comprehensive policy framework demonstrates the\nGovernment's commitment to achieve full cost recovery in the pricing of", "14\nenergy and to enhance private sector involvement in the energy sector,\nand highlights the priority attached by the Government to pursuing an\nenergy conservation program. it has helped to consolidate initiatives\ntaken from time to time in recent years in the energy sector.\nFormalization of these initiatives in a policy framework outlined in the\nGPS has reconfirmed their direction, strengthened their content and\nminimized the risk of reversal. These developments will provide a more\nsatisfactory and assured environment for rapid growth and efficient\noperation of the energy sector. The Government has agreed under the\nSpecial Assistance Loan to implement the measures outlined in the GPS and\nto keep the Bank informed from time to time concerning the progress it has\nmade toward implementing those measures. To date the Government has\nimplemented the three time-bound measures provided in that GPS, including\nthe recommendations of the Gas Pricing Committee, announcing the fourth\nround of exploration offerings and preparing the APENCON.\nM.\t Project Justification and Benefits\n41. Amajor constraint on industrial development in India has been\nthe persistent supply/demand gap for commercial energy (including power).\nThe Project will help to ease this critical supply/demand gap for\ncommercial energy and thereby help to promote further industrial and\noverall economic growth and development. It supports the Government's\nstrategy of increasing the indigenous energy supply. It will help to\nreduce the nation's dependence on oil imports and will save, on average,\nabout $148 million annually in foreign exchange during its 16-year\neconomic life. The Project will also create about 2,000 jobs during\nimplementation and around 500 permanent jobs when in full operation. The\nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) (after tax) is estimated at 14.0\nper cent, which is considered satisfactory for projects of this type. The\neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 51.6 per cent.\nSensitivity analysis indicates that the Project will remain viable under\nadverse conditions. Under the most adverse scenario, i.e., 20 per cent\ndecrease in production, 20 per cent decrease in prices, 20 per cent\nincrease in capital and operation and maintenance costs, two year delay\nin Project implementation and 10 per cent increase in the depletion\npremium, the EIRR remains at 32 per cent. Similarly, under the most\nadverse situation, sensitivity tests show that the FIRR remains\nfinancially sound at 6 per cent in real terms.\nN.\t Project Risks\n42. In the drilling and production of oil and gas, there is always\na technical risk. The Project is aimed at developing proven reserves from\na field that already contains a large number of wells, which helps to\nconfirm the extent of the reserves and to increase the accuracy of\nestimating them. The field has already had a relatively good, although\nbrief, history of production, with no substantial differences between\nactual and forecast rates of production. However, because of the\ncomplexity of the reservoir, since the field is an oil, condensate and gas\nfield, recovery and production of hydrocarbons could fall below\nexpectations if the reservoir is not developed and managed efficiently.\nSuch risks will be minimized, however, through the provision of\nconsultancy inputs and staff training to help ONCC continually optimize", "15\nthe development and operation of the field. As regards safety risks, the\nProject could be subject to fire and explosion hazards during drilling\nand production of oil and gas from the field. However, such risks are\nconsidered relatively small, because the Project facilities are designed\nto meet industry safety standards, and staff of the Executing Agency will\nbe trained under the Project to operate and maintain the facilities safely\nand efficiently. Implementation delays could result from inadequate\nproject management. However, the Project team has already acquired a\nsubstantial amount of experience in implementing Phase 1 of the Gandhar\nfield under the World Bank-financed Western Gas Development Project (see\nAnnex). The training to be provided to the staff of the Executing Agency,\nthe planned effort on the part of Bank staff in Project monitoring and\nsupervision, and the hiring of additional private sector rigs by ONGC if\nneed be to speed up drilling will all contribute toward minimizing delays\nin Project implementation. Further, the Project will be reviewed monthly\nby the Regional Director of the Western Region. In addition, the existing\nExecutive Committee Production Monitoring Team headed by the Chairman of\nONGC will review monthly, among other things, the progress of the Project.\nMarketing risks are also minimal since users of oil have been identified\nand are readily available. Either gas-users already exist or new gas-\nuser facilities are planned or under construction. Delays in completing\nnew facilities can be minimized, since free gas production can be cut back\nand more gas allocated to existing consumers.\n0.\t Technical Assistance\n43.\t The Government has requested Bank financing for two TA projects:\n(i) Safety and Environmental Management of ONGC's Activities - This\ninvolves consulting services for\n(a) preparation of appropriate safety and maintenance\nprocedures and manuals for inspection and maintenance of\nONGC's submarine pipelines and production platforms in the\nwestern offshore areas;\n(b) advanced training of ONGC personnel in safety and disaster\nmanagement\n(c) hazard and risk analyses of ONGC operations at two\nlocations\n(d) recycling of treated waste-water from the Gandhar field for\nagricultural use, and\n(e) mobile monitoring of air quality in different areas.\n(ii) Evaluation of Petroleum Exploration and Development Risk\nContracts: This involves\n(a) consultant services for preparing a comparative study of\nthe different types of exploration contracting arrangements\nin current use, and", "16\n(b) a regional workshop to exchange information and experiences\ngained by other countries in attracting private sector\ncompanies to explore for and produce oil and gas.\n44. The total costs of the proposed TAs are $1,160,000 and $200,000,\nrespectively. It is proposed to provide grants to meet the entire foreign\nexchange costs ($890,000) of the Safety and Environmental Management TA\nand ($180,000) of the Evaluation of Petroleum Exploration and Development\nRisk Contracts TA. ONGC and the MPNG will meet the local currency costs.\nONGC will be the Executing Agency for the TA on Safety and Environmental\nManagement of ONGC's Activities above while MPNG will execute the TA on\nEvaluation of Petroleum Exploration and Development Risk Contracts. The\nBank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants will apply to both TAs.\n45. If the proposed loan is approved by the Board of Directors, I,\nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, shall approve the\nprovision of technical assistance to the Government in an amount not\nexceeding the equivalent of $180,000 to be financed as a grant from the\nTechnical Assistance Special Fund for the Evaluation of Petroleum\nExploration and Development Risk Contracts. The proposed financing for\nthe technical assistance for the Safety and Environmental Management of\nONGC's Activities Project is hereby submitted to the Board for its\napproval. The Danish government has expressed interest in the financing\nof this TA. In the event that the Danish financing materializes, then the\nrelevant amount of Bank funds will be cancelled.\nIV. LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY\n46. Drafts of the Loan Agreement (Ordinary Operations) between the\nBank and ONGC and the Guarantee Agreement between India and the Bank are\ncirculated herewith. The provisions of the Bank's Ordinary Loan\nRegulations dated 1 July 1986 are incorporated in the draft Loan\nAgreement, subject, to the modifications set forth in Section 1.01 of the\ndraft Loan Agreement.\n47. The ONCC is authorized to borrow for and implement the Project.\nIndia, acting by its President, is empowered under its constitution and\nlaws to guarantee the loan.\n48. I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the\nArticles of Agreement of the Bank.", "17\n49. Acting, in the absence of the President, under the provisions\nof the last sentence of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of the\nBank, I recommend that the Board approve the proposed loan to ONCC for the\nGandhar Field Development Project in an amount of $267 million equivalent\nwith interest determined in accordance with the Bank's pool-based variable\nlending rate system and carrying such other terms and conditions as are\nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and\nGuarantee Agreements presented to the Board.\n50. I also recommend that the Board approve the proposed technical\nassistance grant to the Government of India for the Safety and\nEnvironmental Management of ONGC's activities in an amount of $890,000\nequivalent to be financed from the Technical Assistance Special Fund,\nsubject to availability of funds.\nGUNTHER G.
