Following the March 2005 revolution, a new President was elected in July, and the new \nGovernment had been largely formed by the end of September 2005. The new leadership has \nexpressed  its  commitment  to  address  three  main  challenges:  low  living  standards, \nunemployment, and widespread corruption. The Government has started to prepare its vision \nfor  the  political  and  economic  development.  As  the  mandate  of  the  first  national  poverty \nreduction strategy (NPRS) will end in 2005, the Government intends to complete NPRS-II by \nApril 2006. Following the Government\u2019s request for assistance in formulating NPRS-II, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), the Department for International Development (DFID) of the United \nKingdom, the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC), and the World Bank\u2014all of whom had \nearlier agreed on a joint country strategy and program (CSP)\u2014agreed to provide assistance in \nthe  areas  of  their  comparative  advantage.  The  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)1  was \nincluded in the 2005 program to assist the Government in preparing the following areas of  \nNPRS-II: monitoring and evaluation, technical support in selected areas, and public awareness \nand project management. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  New Challenges and Opportunities. In May 2001, the Kyrgyz Republic adopted a \nlong-term development strategy, the comprehensive development framework (CDF) covering \n2001\u20132010.2 The NPRS for 2003\u20132005 (NPRS-I) was the first phase in CDF implementation \nand was used as a medium-term action program for economic, social, and political reforms \naimed at poverty reduction, pro-poor growth, and sustainable human development. While some \neconomic progress was achieved, implementation of some strategies fell short of the target. \nAlthough the income poverty rate declined from 55.3% in 1999 to about 39.0% in 2004,3 and the \nhuman development index improved from 0.719 in 2000 to 0.728 in 2003, poverty remains \nwidespread and extreme in rural areas, which are home to about 65% of the population.4 \nFollowing the fall of President Akaev\u2019s regime in March 2005 in the wake of public upheaval \nfollowing allegations of fraudulent practices during the February\u2013March parliamentary elections, \ntwo  opposition  leaders  became  the  country\u2019s  President  and  the  Prime  Minister.  The  new \nGovernment has declared poverty reduction and the fight against corruption to be its main policy \nobjectives. NPRS-II, planned for the period 2006\u20132010, will be the second phase of the CDF.  \n \n3.  The preparation of NPRS-II is being undertaken in conjunction with an on-going review \nof the country\u2019s political system, which involves discussions within the Government and the \nParliament,  and  a  public  debate  on  whether  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  should  move  toward  a \npredominantly presidential or a parliamentary system. Although the situation seems stable, the \ndifferences within the coalition Government, the risk of political instability, and its potential \nimpact on economic growth, remain.5 Nevertheless, this is a unique opportunity for the new \nGovernment to critically review the experience of the 15-year transition period, identify policies \nthat worked and those that failed, analyze the underlying reasons, and develop a sound and \nfeasible economic strategy and corresponding policies for the Kyrgyz Republic. The decision by \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 10 November 2005. \n2  The Kyrgyz Republic is one of the 13 CDF pilot countries. \n3  This significant reduction in poverty was brought about by good progress towards market economy together with \nimplementation of policy reforms. \n4  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update, Kyrgyz Republic 2006\u20132008 (CSPU). Manila. \n5  Because of the political turmoil and a fall in gold production at the Kumtor mine (a major contributor to gross \ndomestic product [GDP]), the economic performance has deteriorated, with most optimistic growth projection for \n2005 being 3%, compared with 7.1% in 2004.  \n ", "2   \nmajor international financing institutions (IFIs) to develop a joint country support strategy is \nanother welcoming development. \n \n4.  Joint Country Strategy and Program Process. Of the many IFIs operating in the \nKyrgyz Republic, the largest in terms of their assistance portfolio are ADB and the World Bank. \nADB\u2019s current country strategy expires in 2005 and the World Bank\u2019s in 2006. In response to the \nGovernment\u2019s request, the key IFIs agreed to develop a joint support strategy for the period \n2007 and beyond. The preparation of the joint assessment and joint results-based CSP (RB-\nCSP) started with a brainstorming retreat in September 2005, which discussed the development \npriorities, and the principles for developing the joint RB-CSP.6 The Government and the key IFIs \nagreed that the preparation of NPRS-II and of the joint RB-CSP should take place in parallel. \nThe  Government  asked  the  IFIs  to  coordinate  their  support  for  NPRS-II  preparation  to \nharmonize their assistance programs among themselves and with the country\u2019s development \npriorities. \n \n5.  Lessons Learned from NPRS-I. The preparation of NPRS-I was a joint effort of the \nGovernment and civil society. It benefited from discussions with IFIs and their support.7 The \nNPRS-I was based on three principal components: (i) sustainable economic growth, (ii) an \neffective state, and (iii) building a fair society. Partnerships built under NPRS-I became an \nimportant  tool  in  coordinating  development  aid  and  mobilizing  domestic  resources  for \ndevelopment. Good progress has been made towards achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) and the achievement of four MDGs is on track: primary school enrolment, gender \nequality in primary education, reduction of child mortality, and access to safe drinking water. \nHowever,  progress  towards  two  MDGs  has  not  been  satisfactory:  reducing  the  maternal \nmortality ratio and controlling tuberculosis. \n \n6.  The stakeholders involved in the preparation of NPRS-II appreciate the importance of \nidentifying  the  lessons  learned  from  NPRS-I  implementation.  Currently,  the  Government  is \npreparing an assessment report on NPRS-I, which will be completed by the end of 2005. During \nan initial assessment, two key lessons learned from NPRS-I implementation became apparent: \n(i) the need for sound resource planning and mobilization, and (ii) the need for an effective \nmonitoring mechanism. NPRS-I and the policies to implement it were not linked strongly enough \nwith the state budget and resource planning and debates about how to overcome this problem \nhave been at the center of discussions while the TA was being formulated and designed. It is, \ntherefore, imperative to link the preparation and implementation of NPRS-II with the budgetary \nprocess, the medium-term budget framework (MTBF) and other fiscal initiatives by the Ministry \nof Economy and Finance (MoEF). The system of monitoring and evaluation developed during \nNPRS-I needs to be restored8 and refined, to focus on a few key performance indicators, and to \ntake into account expenditure efficiency and improved statistics. Other lessons identified so far \npoint  toward  the  need  for:  (i)  better  participatory  process,  more  transparency,  and  public \ndiscussions on feedback mechanisms, and a public information campaign; (ii) setting high and \nlow level objectives; (iii) attributing specific responsibilities to line agencies; (iv) appreciating the \n                                                 \n6  The  participants  at  the  brainstorming  retreat  included  representatives  of  the  Government,  ADB,  DFID,  the \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), European Union (EU), International Monetary Fund \n(IMF), Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) and Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), \nSwiss  Cooperation  Office,  various  United  Nations  (UN)  agencies,  the  the  World  Bank  Group,  as  well  as \nrepresentatives of Soros Foundation, International Business Council, and Organization for Security and Co-\noperation in Europe (OSCE).\n7  ADB provided TA to support the preparation of NPRS-I (ADB. 2000.

Preparation Efforts to Date. The Government has undertaken following initial steps in \nthe preparation of NPRS-II: (i) the assessment report on NPRS-I is underway; (ii) extensive \ndiscussions  have  taken  place  on  the  \u2018ownership\u2019  of  NPRS-II  and  the  most  appropriate  \nGovernment body to take the lead; (iii) discussions have also taken place on the role and ways \nof MoEF involvement in the preparation and implementation of NPRS-II; (iv) a draft outline of \nthe NPRS-II document has been prepared and working groups are being formed; and (v) a \nstocktaking of existing documents, assessments, fiscal activities and capacity building initiatives \nis being undertaken.9 A working group consisting of Government officials and representatives of \nkey  IFIs  has  identified  the  following  components  as  necessary  for  the  preparation  and \nimplementation  of  the  NPRS-II:  (i)  methodology  and  institutional  support,  (ii)  resource \nmobilization  and  linkage  to  MTBF,  (iii)  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  (M&ES), \n(iv) technical expert support; and (v) public awareness activities. Based on its comparative \nadvantages and experiences in the Kyrgyz Republic, ADB agreed to support monitoring and \nevaluation activities and selected areas of technical expertise, while DFID, SDC, and the World \nBank will provide support for the remaining components and technical expertise areas. The \nprinciples for providing the TA and the financing plan were discussed and agreed with the \nGovernment and among the IFIs. \n \n8.  Harmonization Efforts. Coordination of IFIs has been institutionalized in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic.10 The World Bank is planning to cofinance preparation and implementation of NPRS-II \nthrough $500,000 support from its Poverty Reduction Strategy Trust Fund. DFID has agreed to \nallocate $50,000 to support NPRS-II preparation, while SDC will provide technical support in \nselected areas.  \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA will contribute to the Government\u2019s efforts to reduce poverty and fight corruption. \nThe main TA outcomes will be the required analytical and institutional framework for preparing \nand implementing the NPRS-II for the period 2006\u20132010, covering some sectors and thematic \nareas. The main outputs of the TA are: (i) sector and thematic studies; (ii) revival of the \nmonitoring and evaluation system; (iii) better public awareness; and (iv) stronger capacity to \nplan, monitor and evaluate NPRS-II. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA is based on the following principles: (i) it will build on the lessons learned from \npreparation and implementation of NPRS-I; (ii) the Government will take explicit ownership and \nleadership of NPRS-II preparation and implementation; and (iii) the TA will be implemented in a \nflexible way, with the possibility of refining and fine-tuning its activities as it progresses. The TA \nwill provide support during the NPRS-II preparation, and early stages of its implementation and \n                                                 \n9  These include the abovementioned MTBF initiative, Institutional Capacity Enhancement for the Public Expenditure \nManagement in the MTBF (funded by the World Bank grant), and Public Expenditure Financial Accountability \n(PEFA). \n10  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  participated  in  the  Rome  High-Level  Forum  as  one  of  the  partner  countries  for  the \nharmonization efforts to streamline the policies and procedures that guide aid delivery worldwide. (High-Level \nForum. 2003. Rome Declaration on Harmonization. Rome.) \n ", "4   \nwill,  in  the  process,  build  capacity  of  the  relevant  Government  agencies.  The  TA\u2019s  three \ninterrelated components are described below.  \n \n(i)  Restoration  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  system. Based on the lessons \nlearned  from  NPRS-I  and  international  best  practices  for  monitoring  and \nevaluating poverty programs, this component will develop: (i) key monitorable \nindicators to measure poverty trends and track progress; (ii) mechanisms to track \nkey  indicators,  and  a  data  collection  strategy  using  simple  and  effective \ninstruments; and (iii) mechanisms for monitoring links between the NPRS-II and \nthe MTBF.  \n(ii)  Technical expert support. Resources will be provided for studies in poverty, \ngender,  and  human  development;  sustainable  economic  growth  and \ninfrastructure  development;  governance  and  public  expenditure  management; \nrisk  assessment;  and  private  and  financial  sector  development.  Specific \nrequirements will be confirmed during the TA inception stage. This component \nwill be financed, where appropriate, in parallel with DFID, SDC, and the World \nBank. \n(iii)  Public  awareness  and  project  management  support.  Public  awareness \nactivities will be carried out and project management support to the President\u2019s \nAdministration  (PA),  which  will  be  responsible  for  overall  coordination  of  all \nNPRS-II activities both during preparation and early stages of implementation, \nwill be provided.  \n \n11.  The ADB TA-financed activities will be closely coordinated with the following other three \ncomponents to be financed by DFID, SDC, and the World Bank. \n \n(i)  Methodology and institutional support. This will facilitate the launch of NPRS-\nII preparation. It is envisaged that an expert will provide methodological advice \non the design and structuring of a well-costed NPRS, including the procedures \nfor effective involvement of line ministries, Parliament and other stakeholders. \n(ii)  Resource  mobilization  and  linkage  with  MTBF. This will improve the link \nbetween  the  poverty  reduction  strategy  and  the  MTBF,  to  ensure  that  the \nresource needs identified by NPRS-II are prioritized and met on an ongoing basis. \n(iii)  Public awareness enhancement activities. This will include (i) developing and \nimplementing efficient mechanisms for involving all stakeholders in the process \nof  preparation  and  implementation  of  the  NPRS-II;  and  (ii)  developing  the \nGovernment\u2019s capacity to undertake participatory consultation processes. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The TA11 is \nestimated  to  cost  $470,000,  comprising  $270,000  in  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $200,000 \nequivalent in local currency cost. ADB will provide $400,000 equivalent, covering the entire \nforeign exchange cost and $130,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government will finance \nthe remaining $70,000 equivalent of the local currency cost in-kind for office facilities, transport, \nand the remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff. Appendix 2 shows the cost estimates \nand financing plan. \n \n                                                 \n11 In parallel to ADB\u2019s support for preparation of the NPRS-II, the World Bank will provide $500,000 and DFID \n$50,000. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  To  oversee  the  general  process  of  NPRS-II  preparation  and  implementation,  the \nGovernment will revive the national council on the NPRS, with high-level representatives from \nthe President\u2019s Administration, Parliament, line ministries, civil society, the private sector, and \nthe IFIs. The strategic development unit (SDU) within the President\u2019s Administration will be the \nExecuting Agency for the TA. A steering committee,12 consisting of representatives from the \nPresident\u2019s  Administration,  MoEF,  regional  authorities,  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  and  other \nagencies, will oversee the overall implementation of the TA, consider the need for adjustments \nin  the  scope  as  appropriate,  and  recommend  or  endorse  the  use  of  TA  resources.  The \nimplementation arrangements will be further reviewed and confirmed at TA inception. \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented over a 24-month period, from January 2006 to December \n2007, covering the preparation of NPRS-II and more than 1 year of its implementation. A total of \n88 person-months of consulting services will be provided: 12 international and 76 domestic. \nConsultants may be hired on individual basis. The outline of terms of reference of international \nand domestic consultants is given in Appendix 3. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by ADB and Its Borrowers and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The consultants \nwill work closely with, and under the supervision of, the SDU. Equipment provided under the TA \nwill be procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement and will be retained by \nthe EA.  \n \n15.  The outputs for the monitoring and evaluation component will be an operational, cost-\neffective, and robust M&ES. The technical experts working on various sectors and thematic \nareas will produce sector studies, reports and assessments (outlined in the Appendix 3). The TA \nresults and the NPRS-II goals will be disseminated during the preparation period and the early \nstages  of  its  implementation,  in  cooperation  with  other  IFIs  through  workshops,  national \nconferences, consultations with civil society, and reports. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Kyrgyz Republic for Support to the Development and Implementation of \nNational Poverty Reduction Strategy II, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n12  Composition, leadership, frequency of meetings, and TOR of the two bodies will be worked out during the inception \nstage in close consultation with all stakeholders. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \nSignificant contribution to  Second national poverty  1.
