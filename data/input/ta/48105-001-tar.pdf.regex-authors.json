INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested policy and \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to enhance the \nPRC\u2019s policies and practices related to the management and recycling of construction and \ndemolition  waste  (CDW).1 A  TA  fact-finding  mission  on  17\u201319  March  2015  reached  an \nagreement with the government on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, \ncosts, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for the consulting services of the TA. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n   \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The continuous economic growth of the PRC since the start of its economic reforms in \n1978  has  been  accompanied  by  rapid  urbanization.  Increased  urbanization  will  remain  an \nessential pillar supporting future growth and development in the PRC, but it also poses a variety \nof  environmental  challenges.  One  of  the  problems  is  the  large  quantities  of  CDW  being \ngenerated as a by-product of the construction boom.3 The Ministry of Housing and Urban\u2013Rural \nDevelopment (MOHURD, formerly known as the Ministry of Construction) estimates that about \n350 million tons of CDW is generated in the PRC per year, or 10 times the amount of domestic \nsolid waste. CDW quantities are projected to increase significantly over the next 2 decades with \nthe lifetime of buildings expiring. Most of this waste is delivered unsegregated (i.e., mixed with \nother waste streams) to suburban or rural areas for disposal in open storage or landfill. This \npractice, often illegal, incurs high transportation costs, occupies valuable land, reduces recycling \npotential and wastes natural resources, and represents an environment concern.4          \n \n3.  While  CDW is  unavoidable  and  zero  waste  is  not  practical,  it  should  be  managed \nfollowing the internationally accepted waste management method hierarchy comprising four \nstrategies: waste reduction, reuse, recycling, and disposal.5 The CDW reduction performance of \nconstruction contractors in the PRC is still poor, as it is mainly driven by short-sighted economic \nand practical considerations rather than environmental and resource efficiency concerns. A \nsmall-scale private sector business  is thriving for the direct reuse of valuable construction \nmaterials such as copper, aluminum, reinforcing steel, wood, and others. Market potential for \nCDW recycling in the PRC is significant; in residential real estate alone, the PRC is building \nabout 1.8 billion square meters per year, or more than one-third of all the buildings in the world, \nproducing and consuming 55% of the cement globally, and consuming 45% of the national \nenergy in doing so.6 Forecasts for the short to midterm future remain positive, with construction \nexceeding 5.2% of gross domestic product.7 CDW recycling may prove to be a significant \nopportunity  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  the  construction  sector.  The  emission \nreduction benefit of using recycled concrete, for example, results from the avoided emissions \nassociated  with  mining  and  processing  aggregate  that  recycled  concrete  is  substituting. \n                                                \n1  The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan. ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, 2015\u20132017. Manila.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 May 2015.  \n3  CDW includes materials produced during the construction, alteration, extension, and demolition of buildings, \nstructures, and pipelines (MOHURD. 2006. PRC Regulations on Management of Urban Construction Waste. \nBeijing). \n4  Typical emissions from landfilling CDWs are chemicals leaching from wood, drywall, and concrete, such as \nchromium, copper, lead, arsenate, and potentially asbestos or asbestos containing materials. \n5  H. Yuan and L. Shen. 2011. Trend of the Research on Construction and Demolition Waste Management. Waste \nManagement. 31. pp. 670\u2013679. \n6  The PRC builds the equivalent in square meters of living space of a city like Rome in about 2 weeks. \n7  European Union Small and Medium Enterprises Centre. 2013. The Construction Sector in China. Beijing. \n ", "2   \nGreenhouse gas savings for using recycled concrete in place of virgin aggregate (crushed stone, \ngravel, and sand) is estimated at 0.01\u20130.03 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per ton. \nFigures are similar for asphalt, and significantly higher for metals such as aluminum.  \n \n4.  National  and  municipal  governments  around  the  world  are  enacting  legislation  that \nencourages recycling of CDW. In Europe, the Waste Framework Directive has been revised by \nthe European Union to include a requirement that 70% of each member state\u2019s CDW be reused \nor recycled by 2020. Countries such as Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the \nUnited Kingdom have already surpassed the 70% benchmark. Asian economies that have \nachieved very high CDW recycling rates include Hong Kong, China; Japan; Singapore; and \nTaipei,China. \n \n5.  Experience from these economies suggests that while much of CDW is recycled for \npurely economic reasons, avoidance of landfill disposal of materials such as concrete, wood, \ngypsum drywall, and asphalt shingles has benefits well beyond financial ones.8 Avoidance of \nlandfilling also provides for a greater degree of environmental protection, a smarter use of \nnatural resources, energy savings, and a net decrease in greenhouse gas emissions.  \n \n6.  For a stable and competitive CDW recycling market to be established, experience shows \nthat  various  instruments  must  be  established,  including  (i)  technical  regulations  (i.e., \nguaranteeing steady supply of CDW of high quality through establishment of standards and \nnorms for deconstruction works and CDW products); (ii) waste treatment regulations controlling \nor banning CDW landfilling, creation of mono landfill for CDW as reservoirs for future recovery \nof inert materials, and enforcement of regulations related to illegal dumping; and (iii) market-\nbased instruments enabling the creation of a robust CDW recycling market that can withstand \nvarious risks in the waste market (such as a tax on landfills or raw construction materials, a \nsubsidy for recycling center establishment and operation, or tax incentives for the utilization of \nrecycled materials). Advanced concepts that promote the polluter pays principle have been \nsuccessfully introduced in the construction industry of some of these economies, including \nextended  producer  responsibility  or  stewardship  programs,  which  encourage  construction \nmaterial manufacturers to redesign products and systems to reduce wastage, facilitate recovery \nand recyclability after usage, and ensure compatibility with post-recovery applications. \n   \n7.  The government has demonstrated continuous commitment to tackling the problem of \nCDW  management  and  promoting  a  circular  economy  and  resource  efficiency.  In  2006, \nMOHURD issued the Regulations on Management of Urban Construction Waste to standardize \nthe methods for handling construction wastes. Technical regulations for CDW management and \nrecycling followed, mainly through the Ministry of Science and Technology, including standards \nand norms for recycled materials and treatment regulations (i.e., landfill ban for unsorted CDW). \nCDW recycling targets are also (implicitly) defined in the Twelfth Five-Year Plan for the Building \nMaterial Industry,  which established strict goals for emission reduction, requiring construction \nand building materials producers to cut their annual energy consumption and carbon dioxide \nemissions per unit of industrial value added9 by 18%\u201320% during the 5-year period.10  \n                                                \n8  The United States CDW recycling industry, for example, was responsible for the direct support of 19,000 jobs in the \nUnited States in 2012. Facility owners have invested over $4.5 billion in the development and construction of CDW \nrecycling infrastructure. The direct annual output (revenue) of the CDW recycling industry was estimated to be \nabout $7.4 billion, and when considering indirect and induced economic output, the industry represented a \ncontribution of over $17 billion. \n9  Value added is the net output of a sector after adding up all outputs and subtracting intermediate inputs. It is \ncalculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or depletion and degradation of natural \nresources. \n ", "  3 \n8.  Despite its great potential and the government\u2019s effort to promote it, CDW recycling rates \ndo not exceed 5%\u201310%. Actual demand for recycled materials is relatively low in the absence of \nincentives to buy recycled materials (as compared to natural aggregates), and concerns over \nthe quality assurance of recycled materials. CDW recycling centers have been established in \nseveral cities in the PRC, but these often struggle to make a profit. The low quality of raw CDW \n(resulting from the absence of clear technical regulations on CDW segregation at source), low \ncosts of natural aggregates, low CDW disposal fees (often fully subsidized) at municipal solid \nwaste and CDW landfills, and illegal CDW disposal are understood to be key limitations to the \npromotion of CDW recycling in the PRC.  \n \n9.  The TA is a timely response to the government\u2019s request for ADB assistance to identify \nsuitable policies and mechanisms to regulate CDW management and promote CDW recycling in \nthe PRC. The TA is closely aligned with ADB\u2019s strategic priorities of the Midterm Review of \nStrategy 202011 and the strategic pillar of environmentally sustainable growth in the country \npartnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC.12 By supporting the PRC\u2019s efforts to promote \nresource conservation, emission reduction, and environmental protection, this TA is fully aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s Environment Operational Directions, 2013\u20132020,13 and the Urban Operational Plan, \n2012\u20132020.14 The TA is also consistent with the priorities of the government\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year \nPlan,  2011\u20132015;  the  PRC\u2019s  emphasis  on  the  realization  of  ecological  civilization  and \ncommitment to curb costs associated with resource depletion and environmental damage (as \nannounced at the Third Plenum);15 and the recently proclaimed concept of \u201cgreenization\u201d of \nproduction, economy, and lifestyle.16  \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be improved CDW management policies and practices in the PRC. The \noutcome  of  the  TA  will  be  an  agreed  set  of  policy  recommendations  to  regulate  CDW \nmanagement and promote CDW recycling. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The  TA  will  have  four  major  outputs  to  contribute  toward  the  achievement  of  the \noutcome and impact: (i) an assessment report on CDW management in the PRC, (ii) a review of \ninternational  good  practice  in  CDW  management  and  recycling,  (iii)  policy  lessons  and \nrecommendations, and (iv) a TA synthesis report.  \n \n12.  Output 1 will investigate, through literature review, questionnaire surveys, and case \nstudies of CDW recycling success stories in PRC cities, the policies and current practices of \nCDW  management  at  construction  and/or  demolition  sites,  the  perceptions  in  relation  to \n                                                                                                                                                       \n10 Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. 2011.

The assessment will include an economic analysis to identify the probability \nof a CDW market failure in the PRC.  \n \n13.  Output  2  will  identify  international  good  practices  in  CDW  recycling  policies  and \ntechnologies. This will include in-depth case studies to be conducted in selected advanced \neconomies with high CDW recycling rates, as well as a study tour to one of these countries. The \ninternational good practice report will document hindering and enabling factors for sustainable \nCDW management and recycling. \n \n14.  Output 3 will draft policy recommendations to regulate CDW management and promote \nCDW recycling. It will consist of (i) policy recommendations to regulate CDW supply, including \ntechnical  guidelines  for  CDW  segregation  and  processing,  and  capacity-building  needs  to \nimprove  CDW  management  at  construction  or  demolition  sites;  and  (ii)  a  set  of  policy \ninstruments to promote demand for, and increase uptake of, recycled CDW in the construction \nindustry. The policy recommendations will be identified and formulated in consultation with \nrelevant ministries and professional associations. A cost\u2013benefit analysis will quantify how much \nthe  implementation  of  these  recommendations  could  benefit  the  PRC.  The  policy \nrecommendations will be published in a synthesis report (output 4).  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $485,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of remuneration and per diem for counterpart staff \n(including time and travel expenses), logistical support in the arrangement of workshops and \nconferences, a fully functional office space for consultants with secretarial assistance, and other \nin-kind contributions (Appendix 2).  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 15 months, from 25 June 2015 to 30 September 2016. \nMOHURD  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA.  MOHURD  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordination and providing information and other conditions necessary for the consultants to \ncomplete  their  tasks  successfully.  The  director  of  MOHURD\u2019s  Urban  Environmental \nManagement  Division  will  serve  as  the  executive  director  of  the  TA  management  office \nresponsible  for  coordinating  day-to-day  operational  matters  among  ADB,  consultants,  and \nrelated government agencies.  \n \n17.  The TA will require consulting services with substantial expertise in waste management \npolicy design and evaluation, CDW management and recycling, and construction materials \nengineering, for a total of 22 person-months (5 international and 17 national). The consultants \nwill be engaged through a firm according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas amended from time to time) using quality- and cost-based selection criteria (with a quality\u2013\ncost weighing rate of 90:10) and simplified technical proposal procedures.17 The draft outline \nterms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. The TA will cover remuneration, travel, \nand per diem of consultants, as well as the costs of workshops, seminars, equipment, surveys, \nand miscellaneous expenses. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).
