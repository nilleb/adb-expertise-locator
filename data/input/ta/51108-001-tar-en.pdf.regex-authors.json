INTRODUCTION \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) will support the preparation of the master plan for the \ndevelopment of Sri Lanka\u2019s railway sector, 2020\u20132040 through policy and advisory work to be \nprovided in Colombo. The Government of Sri Lanka asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfor assistance in preparing the master plan on 14 February 2017. ADB approved the TA concept \npaper on 4 April 2017. In July 2017, an ADB fact-finding mission held discussions with the Ministry \nof Transport and Civil Aviation (MOTCA), the Department of Sri Lanka Railways, and the Ministry \nof National Policies and Economic Development. The mission reached an understanding with the \ngovernment on the TA project's impact, outcome, scope, implementation arrangements, and \nterms of reference.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Country context. Sri Lanka has been successful in promoting inclusive and sustainable \ngrowth. Gross domestic product growth averaged 6% per year over the past decade. The \nincidence  of  poverty  has  declined,  and  the  country  has  achieved  most  of  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. With Sri Lanka on the path to becoming an upper middle-income country, \nthe main challenges to consolidate and advance this status are to (i) promote rapid, inclusive, and \nsustainable growth to reduce poverty and inequality; (ii) shift from a development model driven \nby  debt-financed  public  spending  to  greater  reliance  on  private  investment,  foreign  direct \ninvestment, and exports; (iii) develop export capacity for future growth as the limited size of the \ndomestic  market  (and  demand)  is  a  constraint;  and  (iv)  diversify  production  and  increase \nproductivity across sectors to expand exports, participate in global value chains, and create \nproductive jobs. Infrastructure development, especially in the Western Province and along the \nSouth-Western and North-Eastern development corridors, is essential to tackle these challenges. \n \n3.  Transport sector. Transport in Sri Lanka is mainly on the road network, which is centered \non the capital and commercial hub, Colombo. Road transport accounts for about 93% of land \ntransport in Sri Lanka. The country has 12,000 kilometers (km) of national highways and 152 km \nof expressways. The state-run Sri Lanka Transport Board and private companies provide bus \nservices, the principal mode of public transport. The Sri Lanka Transport Board serves both urban \nand rural routes, which are often unprofitable. The railway network consists of a heavy-rail intercity \nnetwork connecting the main cities of all nine provinces in the country with Colombo, and \ncommuter rail services in Colombo and the Western Province. Sri Lanka has four deep-sea ports \nincluding Colombo Port, a major transshipment port in South Asia. It also has two international \nairports, one in Colombo and the other in Hambantota in the south. \n \n4.  Railway subsector. The Sri Lanka Railway Department under MOTCA, which is branded \nSri Lanka Railways (SLR), is the owner and primary operator. It began in 1858, and at its peak in \nthe first half of the 20th century shouldered more than 80% of total freight transport and more than \n35% of the passenger market. Successive governments focused mainly on running the rail \nnetwork at the existing service level with limited investments in modernization, expansion of the \ncapacity and network. The widespread expansion of the road network, gradual advancement of \nroad-based motorized transportation, policy neglect of the railway system, and bureaucratic and \nnoncommercial nature of the management system contributed to the stagnation. This weakened \nSLR\u2019s performance and eroded its market share. SLR now handles less than 1% of freight and \nonly about 5% of passengers.  \n \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 March 2017.  \n ", "2 \n5.  The railway network covers 1,508 km with 1,676 millimeter broad gauge. SLR operates \nabout 396 trains, including 67 long-distance and 16 intercity trains. Almost 90% of the railway \nnetwork of the country is single track, with 126 km of double tracks, 14 km with three tracks, and \n3 km with four tracks. All multiple lines are in the Western Province. The railway network is \ncentered in Colombo and the Western Province, which has a population of 5.8 million (29% of the \ncountry) and produces about 43% of the national gross domestic product. It has the highest per \ncapita income at $2,922 (2012). The suburban network in the Western Province totals about 230 \nkm and carries more than 80% of SLR\u2019s passengers. The railway network includes a link to \nColombo Port, the country\u2019s main seaport. \n \n6.  Government strategy. The government\u2019s strategy for public transport and the railway \nsystem, as outlined in the Public Investment Program, 2017\u20132020, is to meet the current and \nfuture passenger and goods transport demand by ensuring quality, safety, and affordability with \nthe widest possible modal mix and technological innovations to provide for mobility requirements.2 \nBy 2020, the program intends to (i) double the share of railway passenger transport to 10% from \n5% in 2015, (ii) increase the share of railway freight transport to 5% from 1%, and (iii) increase \nthe share of public transport passenger movement to 65% from the present level of 58% in 2015. \nThe government intends to achieve these targets by improving the railway system\u2019s institutions \nand management, harmonizing land use planning with infrastructure development, and enhancing \nmultimodal integration. The railway system would have a competitive advantage in three strategic \nmarket segments: (i) suburban passenger service (in Colombo and Kandy, in particular); (ii) long \ndistance express service, where the railway could be faster and more comfortable than road \ntransportation and more economical than air transportation; and (iii) redevelopment of freight \ntransportation,  which  could  generate  significant  socioeconomic  benefits,  while  bringing  in \nrevenues to improve the overall institutional economics. \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s strategy. ADB is supporting the government\u2019s inclusive and sustainable growth \nstrategy to consolidate and advance its upper middle-income country status by (i) strengthening \nthe drivers of growth to promote diversification of economic activities and increase productivity; \nand (ii) improving the quality of growth to reduce poverty and inequality in priority areas, such as \nupgrading  and  expanding  infrastructure  in  key  sectors  (e.g.,  transport,  energy,  and  urban \ndevelopment). The TA is in line with the government\u2019s priority investment areas for projects and \nprograms identified in the forthcoming country partnership strategy for Sri Lanka. These include \nupgrading and expanding infrastructure by supporting strategic investments and policy reforms in \nkey sectors such as transport, energy, and urban development. \n \n8.  The TA will prepare a strategy for the development of the railway transport subsector and \nthe integration of railways with other modes of transport. Institutional reforms to improve efficiency \nwithin the subsector will be studied, and recommendations for improvements provided. This TA \nwill therefore complement ongoing support by a project preparatory TA for a feasibility study and \nand a TA-loan for detailed design of improvements in the suburban railway network in Colombo.3,4 \nThe TA will help develop a pipeline with priorities for strategic interventions in the railway \nsubsector for infrastructure development and capacity building. The TA will pave the way for a \ncoordinated approach into subsector development by ADB and development partners. This will \nsupplement prior and ongoing investments in the road subsector in rural roads, national roads, \nand expressways, as well as investments in the maritime subsector, i.e., the Colombo Port project. \n                                                \n2  Government of Sri Lanka, Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs. 2017.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: mobility through a safe and affordable \nintegrated public land transport system with wide multimodal mix and technological innovation \nprovided (footnote 2). The TA will have the following outcome: strategy for the development of \nthe railway sector established.5 \n \nB.  Output, Methods, and Activities  \n10.  Output: Railway master plan prepared. The TA will support the preparation of a railway \nmaster plan (2020\u20132040) through a study to (i) assess the expected future railway demand based \non the targeted market share, (ii) forecast the expected number of passengers traveling by rail, \nand (iii) suggest the means to achieve the targeted role of the railway in the transport sector. The \nTA will assess the characteristics of existing railway operations, as well as of existing and planned \ninfrastructure and other assets such as rolling stock and equipment. It will prepare the overall \nrailway development framework. The TA will also study the institutional setup of the railway \nsubsector in Sri Lanka and prepare an institutional development plan. The TA will also prioritize \ninvestments in key elements such as infrastructure, rolling stock, and equipment. It will identify \npotential future projects for public and private sector funding, including projects for possible ADB \nfinancing. The master plan will be made available to the public on the ADB and MOTCA websites.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.8 million, of which $1.5 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 2. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, office \naccommodation, existing reports and studies, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.
