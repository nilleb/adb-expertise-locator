THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nNepal for the Rural Enterprise Financing Project. The report also describes proposed technical \nassistance (TA) for Capacity Development for Rural Enterprise Financing, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe TA. \n \n2.  The project will increase incomes of subsistence small farmers by helping them engage \nin rural enterprises. The project will finance rural enterprises comprising (i) collective enterprises \nthat are jointly owned and operated by small farmers, and (ii) individual enterprises. The project \nwill also improve the financial intermediary\u2019s rural enterprise financing capacity as well as provide \nvalue chain development and business facilitation support for small farmers, especially women. \nThe project comprises (i) a loan of $50 million from the concessional ordinary capital resources \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and (ii) a TA grant of $750,000 to be financed from ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF  6)  for  $500,000  and  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Sector \nDevelopment Partnership Special Fund for $250,000.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Rural poverty in Nepal. Nepal has made notable socioeconomic progress as indicated \nin the decline of the population living below poverty line from 41.8% in 1995 to 25.2% in 2011.2 \nHowever, as of 2018, 28.6% of the total population is still multidimensionally poor.3 Nepal\u2019s \npoverty is predominantly a rural phenomenon, with 7% of the urban population and 33% of the \nrural population being multidimensionally poor. Nepal\u2019s rural poverty is closely associated with \nlimited gainful employment opportunities in rural areas where the agriculture sector dominates \nemployment. The agriculture sector contributes 27.0% to the country\u2019s gross domestic product \nbut employs 70.1% of the total population.4 However, the sector is largely subsistence in nature \nand  confined  to  primary  production  of  crops  and  livestock  with  little  value  addition  and \ncommercialization.5 The earnings from subsistence agriculture activities are hardly enough for \nrural households to move out of poverty.6 \n \n4.  To reduce rural poverty, it is necessary to shift from current subsistence production to \nvalue-adding rural enterprises. A value chain in agriculture is a set of activities that adds value to \ncommodities  and  links  primary  producers  to  processers,  traders,  merchants  with  storage, \n                                                \n1  Established by ADB.

Rural enterprises are micro, small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in rural areas and include on-farm and off-farm enterprises. \nOn-farm enterprises produce crops and livestock for commercial sale. Off-farm enterprises \nencompass  all  types  of  economic  activities  excluding  subsistence  production  and  on-farm \nenterprises.  In  general,  rural  enterprises  can  generate  at  least  30%  more  income  than \nsubsistence production.7 However, rural enterprise development in Nepal is hampered because \nof  insufficient  business  facilitation  and  limited  rural  enterprise  financing.  Developing  rural \nenterprises in Nepal requires various support, including business facilitation, capacity building, \nand financing. \n \n5.  Rural  enterprise  financing  in  Nepal.  In  Nepal,  formal  financial  institutions  are \ncategorized into commercial banks (class A), development banks (class B), finance companies \n(class C), and microfinance institutions (MFIs) (class D). Class D MFIs include (i) microfinance \ndevelopment banks; (ii) microfinance nongovernment organizations; and (iii) savings and credit \ncooperatives, which are licensed and supervised by Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the central bank. \nIn addition to those financial institutions, there are semiformal microfinance nongovernment \norganizations and savings and credit cooperatives that provide financial services without NRB \nlicenses. \n \n6.  Among the formal financial institutions, commercial banks dominate the sector. As of \nMarch 2019, commercial banks\u2019 share of the total financial sector loan portfolio was 80.47%, \ndevelopment banks\u2019 share was 10.56%, finance companies\u2019 share was 2.15%, and MFIs\u2019 share \nwas  6.82%.8  Finance  companies\u2019  rural  outreach  is  insignificant.  Commercial  banks  and \ndevelopment banks have rural branches; however, despite the government\u2019s various policy \nmeasures to increase rural lending, their loan portfolios are mainly concentrated in urban areas \nand the corporate sector.9 Further, banks\u2019 loans to MSMEs are estimated at about 25% of their \ntotal loan portfolio.10 \n \n7.  Banks  have  limited  appetite  to  finance  rural  enterprises  because  of  the  high  cost \nassociated with making small loans in rural areas. In addition, banks\u2019 rural financing is limited \nbecause of (i) banks\u2019 limited rural outreach, (ii) banks\u2019 limited knowledge and risk assessment \ncapacity in rural enterprise financing, and (iii) rural enterprises\u2019 difficulty in securing valid loan \ncollateral. \n \n8.  In Nepal, formal and semiformal MFIs serve over 5 million poor and low-income clients in \nrural areas. MFIs mainly provide short-term microcredit for subsistence agriculture activities and \ncottage-sized income-generating activities. MFIs can provide loans up to NRs700,000 without \ncollateral but based on group guarantee, and above NRs700,000 to NRs1 million with collateral. \nMFIs are unable to scale up their operations to finance rural enterprise because of (i) a regulatory \nceiling on MFIs\u2019 loans of NRs1 million, (ii) MFIs\u2019 limited sources of funding, and (iii) MFIs\u2019 limited \n                                                \n7  ADB.

Commercial banks\u2019 limited lending to rural \nMSMEs and MFIs\u2019 inability to scale up their operations create a vacuum of access to finance for \nrural enterprises. \n \n9.  Small Farmers Development Bank. Small Farmers Development Bank (SFDB) was \nestablished in July 2001 and licensed by NRB as a class D MFI.11 It is an apex microfinance bank \nthat promotes access to finance to small farmers. SFDB provides wholesale loans to small \nfarmers agriculture cooperatives (SFACs) and technical and training support for SFAC members\u2019 \nincome-generating activities. \n \n10.  As of March 2019, SFDB had 680 affiliated member SFACs in 68 districts.12 SFDB offers \nwholesale loans to SFACs for (i) general microcredit, (ii) livestock credit, (iii) renewable energy \ncredit,  and  (iv)  livelihood  restoration  microcredit  for  households  that  were  affected  by  the \nearthquake in 2015. Of SFDB\u2019s total loan portfolio, 95.79% are general microcredit and livestock \nloans. However, because of the growing demand for enterprise loans from SFACs, in 2016, SFDB \nstarted a pilot loan to a tea processing factory jointly owned by SFAC-member small farmers in \nJhapa District in eastern Nepal. In 2019, there are five such collective enterprises in operation.13 \n \n11.  In fiscal year (FY) 2018, SFDB\u2019s total loans outstanding with SFACs amounted to NRs17 \nbillion, up from NRs8 billion in FY2015. The on-time recovery rate is 99.95%. SFDB\u2019s capital \nadequacy ratio is 10.38%, which is above the statutory required capital of 8.00% for class D MFIs. \nSFDB\u2019s return on equity of 21.97% and return on assets of 3.21% are adequate. SFDB\u2019s net \nincome increased to NRs393 million in FY2018 from NRs154 million in FY2015. SFDB does not \ncollect public deposits but relies mostly on short-term loans from the government, banks, and \nother financial institutions. Heavy reliance on short-term borrowing puts pressure on SFDB\u2019s cost \nof fund. Its weighted average cost of capital was 5.73% in FY2018 as compared to 2.99% in \nFY2015, which made its interest rate structure unpredictable and volatile. Access to long-term \nfunding will allow SFDB to strengthen its liquidity and reduce its cost of fund volatility. \n \n12.  Small farmers agriculture cooperatives. SFACs are member-owned and member-\nmanaged community-based organizations that provide savings and credit services to members. \nSFACs are registered cooperatives with the Department of Cooperatives under the Cooperative \nAct of 1992. There are 670,866 SFAC members, of which 75% are women in 2018. The SFAC \nmembers are small and marginal farmers with landholding of less than 0.75 hectares.14 In 2018, \nthe total number of SFAC member borrowers was 326,767, of which 75.23% (245,825) were \nwomen. The average loan size for all borrowers was NRs140,485, while that for women borrowers \nwas NRs95,300. In FY2018, SFACs\u2019 total loans outstanding to members stood at NRs435 billion, \nup from NRs207 billion in FY2015. SFACs\u2019 aggregate recovery rate was 97.63%. SFACs show \nstrong credit demand, as their members are increasingly seeking loans for their MSME ventures. \n                                                \n11 Sana Kisan Bikas Laghubitta Bittiyasanstha Ltd or commonly called SFDB. \n12 SFAC eligibility criteria to be affiliated with SFDB include the following: (i) registered as a cooperative; (ii) at least 2 \nyears of experience in providing savings and credit services after registration; (iii) potentiality to increase outreach \nand business; (iv) have developed a 3-year business plan; (v) proper record keeping in a double-entry bookkeeping \nsystem; (vi) regularity in general assembly and board meetings; and (vii) no delinquent loans with the board of \ndirectors, staff and their family members in the cooperative, and other financial institutions. \n13 The existing SFAC collective enterprises are a milk collection center and two rice mills in Rupandehi District, and a \ntea processing factory and a seed processing factory in Jhapa District. \n14 SFAC member criteria include the following: (i) a family with land area up to 0.76 hectares in the hills and up to 0.67 \nhectares in the Terai (a lowland area in southern Nepal); (ii) an individual or household with livelihood difficulties and \nno regular income; and (iii) an individual or household with no overdue loans with banks, financial institutions, or the \ngovernment. \n ", "4 \nAlthough SFACs are actively seeking other funding sources, their funding source is limited mainly \nto loans from SFDB and SFACs\u2019 member deposits. \n \n13.  Proposed solution. The project will promote rural enterprises to generate employment \nand improve incomes of subsistence small farmers. Under the project, rural enterprises are \ncategorized as (i) collective enterprises that engage in the production, processing, and marketing \nof agriculture produce and are jointly owned by SFACs and their members; and (ii) individual \nenterprises that are owned and operated by individual SFAC members. SFDB is an anchor \nfacilitator and investor for rural enterprises and uses its SFAC networks across Nepal for \nenterprise facilitation and financial intermediation. The project has an innovative feature of \ntransforming subsistence small farmers into micro, small, and medium-sized entrepreneurs with \nthe combined support of value chain development, business facilitation, and financing. The \nfinancial intermediary modality was chosen because it is the most effective channel to facilitate \nrural enterprise development. By adopting the financial intermediary modality, the project can \nexercise prudent client selection and due diligence to ensure the project\u2019s rural enterprise \ninvestments are sustainable and yield effective social and economic returns for eligible small \nfarmers. \n \n14.   Government policy. The government\u2019s 14th Three-Year Development Plan, FY2017\u2013\nFY2019 has the goals of (i) improving the living standards of the Nepalese people through various \npolicies of high economic growth, (ii) reducing the poverty rate by 21% through employment \ngeneration,  (iii)  reducing  economic  inequalities,  and  (iv)  generating  dignified  and  gainful \nemployment opportunities.15 Further, the government\u2019s Agriculture Development Strategy, 2015\u2013\n2035 promotes the agriculture sector\u2019s profitable commercialization to transform the sector from \nsubsistence farming to agribusiness enterprises.16 \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s sector experience. The project is based on ADB\u2019s successful rural finance project \nexperiences in Nepal. ADB financed the Rural Finance Sector Development Cluster Program \n(RFSDCP) (subprograms 1 and 2) and the Disaster Risk Reduction and Livelihood Restoration \nProject (DRRLRP).17 The RFSDCP reformed key rural finance institutions, including SFDB. The \nRFSDCP\u2019s project completion reports rated both subprogram 1 and 2 successful and recognized \nthe project\u2019s impact on expanded rural finance outreach, while recommending close impact \nmonitoring on women\u2019s access to finance.18 The DRRLRP was an emergency assistance grant \nresponding to the earthquake in Nepal in 2015; it has provided livelihood restoration microcredit \nto  over  15,700  affected  households.  Under  the  RFSDCP  and  DRRLRP,  SFDB  was  the \nimplementing agency, and it has successfully implemented the institutional reform and financial \nintermediary components. \n \n                                                \n15 Government of Nepal, National Planning Commission. 2017. 14th Three-Year Development Plan, FY2017\u2013FY2019. \nKathmandu. \n16 Government of Nepal, Ministry of Agricultural Development. 2015.

The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030\u2019s \noperational  priorities  of  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  (ii) \naccelerating  progress  in  gender  equality,  and  (iii)  promoting  rural  development  and  food \nsecurity.19 The project will contribute to developing rural areas and generating quality jobs by \npromoting  rural  enterprises,  and  support  women\u2019s  economic  empowerment  by  creating \nentrepreneurship opportunities for women. The project is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Review of \n2011 Financial Sector Operational Plan, which recommended retaining a focus on inclusive \nfinance to deliver affordable financial services to small businesses.20 \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n17.  The project is aligned with the following impact: employment-oriented economic activities \nincreased (footnote 15). The project will have the following outcome: small farmers\u2019 engagement \nin rural enterprises increased.21 \n \n18.  Output 1: Collective enterprises developed and financed. The project will develop and \nfinance at least 50 collective enterprises with value chain development and business facilitation \nsupport.  Typical  collective  enterprises  include  commercial  farming,  milk  collection  centers, \nmustard oil mills, rice mills, seed processing factories, and tea processing factories. For each \ncollective enterprise, a group of SFAC members will be the owner and shareholders, of which at \nleast  40%  are  women.  SFDB  will  make  a  wholesale  loan  to  SFACs  to  finance  collective \nenterprises. The maximum loan size to a collective enterprise will be NRs20 million.22 The \nrepayment obligation of an SFAC\u2019s loan for a collective enterprise will be shared among the \nshareholders proportional to each member\u2019s shareholding. SFDB will finance only those collective \nenterprises with strong financial viability and marketing potential, and which meet the eligibility \ncriteria. \n \n19.  Output 2: Individual enterprises promoted and financed. The project will also support \nSFAC members who are willing to start or expand their individual enterprises. Typical individual \nenterprises  include  commercial  farming  and  livestock  production,  and  agriculture  produce \ncollection, processing and marketing. The project will finance about 500 individual entrepreneurs, \nincluding start-ups; at least 30% of the entrepreneurs will be women. The maximum loan size to \nan  individual  enterprise  will  be  NRs5  million  (footnote  22).  SFDB  will  provide  value  chain \ndevelopment and business facilitation support for individual enterprises, especially for women. \n \n20.  Output 3: Rural enterprise financing capacity enhanced. The project will support \nSFDB\u2019s and SFACs\u2019 enterprise financing skills, especially in business appraisal, due diligence, \nrisk assessment, financial management, and safeguards. Specifically, the project will support \nSFDB to develop the collective and individual enterprises by financing operational policies and \nguidelines as well as assisting in business identification, appraisal and monitoring of the collective, \nand individual enterprise loan portfolio. The project will also support establishing a detailed \nmanagement  information  system  to  capture  the  information  on  rural  enterprise  business \nperformance, and gender-disaggregated impacts on employment generation and incomes. \n \n                                                \n19 ADB. 2018.

Value Added by ADB \n \n21.  The project aims to build on the RFSDCP\u2019s successful outcome, especially SFDB\u2019s \nexpanded rural finance outreach (para. 15), and to scale up SFDB\u2019s operation from microcredit \nto rural enterprise financing. Currently, three development partners implement inclusive finance \nand  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise  finance  projects  in  Nepal  focusing  on  capacity \ndevelopment for commercial banks.23 The project\u2019s financial intermediation to rural enterprises \nwill complement other development partners\u2019 interventions. Further, the project has an innovative \napproach by promoting collective rural enterprises. Unlike regular  small and medium-sized \nenterprise projects in which the loans are provided to sole proprietorship enterprises, the project \nwill organize subsistence small farmers into enterprise shareholders and transform them into rural \nentrepreneurs. The project\u2019s focus on capacity building of SFDB and its partner SFACs will have \na lasting impact on financial inclusion for rural MSMEs by scaling up MFIs\u2019 enterprise financing \noperations.  The  project  will  have  a  strong  synergy  with  the  Food  Safety  and  Agriculture \nCommercialization Program for Nepal by extending the business facilitation and financing support \nto agribusinesses to be developed under the program.24 \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n22.  The project is estimated to cost $50 million (Table 1). The sub-borrowers are expected to \ncontribute at least 18% of the total rural enterprise subproject investments from their own \nsources.25 The summary financing plan is in Table 2.  \n  \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amount \nCredit linea  50 \nTotal  50 \na  The sub-borrowers are expected to contribute to at least 18% of the total rural enterprise subproject \ninvestments from their own sources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \n   Amount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \n   \nAsian Development Bank  \nOrdinary capital resources (concessional loan)a  50  100 \nTotal  50  100 \na  The sub-borrowers are expected to contribute at least 18% of the total rural enterprise subproject \ninvestments from their own sources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n                                                \n23 These are (i) the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom\u2019s Sakchyam Access to Finance \nfor the Poor Programme, (ii) German development cooperation through KfW\u2019s Sustainable Economic Development \nProgram, and (iii) the International Fund for Agricultural Development\u2019s Samriddhi Rural Enterprises and Remittances \nProject. \n24 ADB.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Policy-Based \nLoan and Technical Assistance Grant to Nepal for the Food Safety and Agriculture Commercialization Program. \nManila.    \n25 The sub-borrowers will contribute to the fixed capital investments for the collective and individual enterprise loans, \nwith contributions comprising cash, in-kind, or labor. As such, it is difficult to accurately quantify the sub-borrower \ncontributions in monetary terms. Accordingly, the sub-borrower contributions are not expressed in United States \ndollars.  \n ", "7 \n23.  The government has requested a concessional loan of $50 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year \nthereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \nThe final relending, onlending, and sub-lending terms and conditions are determined during the \nsubsidiary loan agreement negotiation between the government and SFDB. \n \n24.  ADB will disburse the loan proceeds following its Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as \namended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed between the government and \nADB. The advance fund procedure will be used based on the estimate of the eligible expenditures \nfor the forthcoming 6 months. SFDB and the SFACs funded under the project will submit an \nannual audited statement of utilization of funds. \n \n25.  Relending. The government will relend the ADB loan proceeds to SFDB in local currency. \nThe provisional relending interest rate and terms are 5% per year with up to a 32-year term, \nincluding a grace period of up to 8 years, and other conditions to be defined in the subsidiary \nagreement between the government and SFDB. The government will bear the foreign exchange \nrisks. \n \n26.  Onlending. SFDB will onlend to eligible SFACs for financing rural enterprises. The \nprovisional onlending interest rate and terms are 7% per year with up to a 8-year term including \na grace period of up to 2 years for the fixed capital loans and no grace period for the working \ncapital loans, and other conditions to be defined in the financing agreement between SFDB and \nSFACs. \n \n27.  Sub-lending. SFACs will sub-lend to eligible members for their collective and individual \nenterprise investments. The provisional sub-lending interest rates and terms are as follows: (i) for \ncollective enterprises, 10% per year with up to a 7-year term, including a grace period of up to 2 \nyears for the fixed capital loans and no grace period for the working capital loans; (ii) for individual \nenterprises, 10% per year with up to a 5-year term, including a grace period of up to 1 year for \nthe fixed capital loans and no grace period for the working capital loans, and other conditions to \nbe defined in the loan agreement between SFAC and sub-borrowers. \n \n28.  Revolving fund (at Small Farmers Development Bank). The loans repaid by SFACs \nwill be maintained at the rural enterprise fund account established at SFDB. SFDB will onlend to \nSFACs with the project\u2019s same onlending terms and conditions for rural enterprises financing by \nSFDB. The same SFAC and sub-borrower eligibility criteria for rural enterprise financing will be \napplied. SFDB will maintain a separate account for the revolving fund. \n \n29.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n32.  The  Ministry  of  Finance,  represented  by  the  Financial  Sector  Management  and \nCorporation Coordination Division (FSMCCD), will be the executing agency. SFDB will be the \nimplementing agency and financial intermediary. A project steering committee will be formed \nchaired by the secretary of the Ministry of Finance and comprising members from the FSMCCD, \nNRB, and SFDB. The project implementation unit will be established at SFDB and led by a project \ncoordinator with at least two full-time staff whose qualifications are satisfactory to ADB. The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project \nadministration manual (PAM).27 \n                                                \nsavings, and internal reserves.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n33.  The project will have an attached TA to support SFDB and SFACs to enhance their \ncapacity in rural enterprise financing and extend rural enterprise business facilitation and value \nchain development support.28 The TA outputs include (i) at least 50 collective enterprise received \nvalue chain development and business facilitation support; (ii) at least 500 individual enterprises \nreceived value chain development and business facilitation support; (iii) SFDB\u2019s rural enterprise \nfinancing unit established; (iv) SFDBs\u2019 collective and individual enterprise financing operational \npolicies and guidelines developed; (v) at least 100 SFACs developed skills on collective enterprise \nfinancing and portfolio management; and (vi) at least 300 SFACs developed skills on individual \nenterprise financing and portfolio management.  \n \n34.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6); and (ii) $250,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund (footnote 1). \nDisbursement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). SFDB will provide counterpart support equivalent to $30,000 in the \nform of office space, counterpart staff, logistical support, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n35.  SFDB  is  highly  skilled  in  developing  saving  and  credit  cooperatives  and  providing \nwholesale loans for microcredit. It has established operational procedures and skilled staff for \nloan appraisal, loan sanction, and portfolio monitoring and reporting. The project will develop \nSFDB\u2019s rural enterprise financing skills through the attached TA. SFACs to be financed under the \n                                                \n28 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nproject will be registered cooperatives and will meet the project eligibility criteria. SFDB will assist \ncapacity development for SFACs\u2019 rural enterprise financing. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n36.  The unmet rural enterprise financing demand was estimated at NRs106 billion in 2018.29 \nRegarding financial viability, SFDB is financially sound as indicated by its satisfactory capital \nadequacy ratio, low nonperforming asset ratio, and high return on equity and assets. SFDB\u2019s \ninterest rate risk is appropriately managed but could be strengthened. Based on the financial \nanalysis of 20 sample SFACs, their financial performance is acceptable; however, SFACs are \nsusceptible to credit risk, operational risk, and interest rate risk, which will be mitigated through \nperiodical and structured monitoring. SFACs\u2019 credit demand is robust as evidenced by the growth \nof SFDB\u2019s loans outstanding with SFACs, which increased from NRs3.6 billion in FY2013 to \nNRs16.9 billion in FY2018.30 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n37.  Currently, SFDB and SFACs have limited capacity in enterprise financing. The project, \nthrough the attached TA, will develop SFDB\u2019s and SFACs\u2019 enterprise financing capacity especially \nin business appraisal, due diligence, risk assessment, financial management, and safeguards to \nensure the sustainability of the rural enterprise subprojects. SFDB will finance only those SFACs \nand  sub-borrowers  that  meet  the  eligibility  criteria  and  have  strong  financial  viability  and \nsustainability. SFDB will ensure that the interest rates to be charged for SFACs and the sub-\nborrowers  cover  all  costs  and  risks  and  have  adequate  margin  to  ensure  operational \nsustainability. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n38.  ADB requirements and policies on financial management and procurement measures, and \nenvironmental and social safeguards, were discussed and agreed with the government and SFDB \nand incorporated in the project design. The specific requirements are described in the PAM. \nProcurement of goods, works, and non-consultancy services will follow the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n(2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Procurement  will  be  undertaken  by  the  individual \nbeneficiary;  fitness  for  purpose  can  be  achieved  by  using  established  private  sector  and \ncommercial practices. \n \n39.  SFDB\u2019s governance is found adequate. SFDB\u2019s board of directors comprises seven \nrepresentatives: four from the promotor group, two from the general public, and one independent \nprofessional director. SFDB selects and lends only to SFACs whose operational and financial \nindicators are sound. As a licensed class D institution, SFDB is required to comply with NRB\u2019s \nregulations and directives, and is subject to regular on-site and off-site supervision. \n \n40.  The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is moderate. SFDB\u2019s financial \nmanagement assessment indicated that SFDB has sufficient experience in managing similar \nprojects for ADB and other international development partners and has the necessary financial \nmanagement  arrangements.31  However,  some  weaknesses  were  identified,  including  the \n                                                \n29 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "11 \nfollowing:  (i)  outdated  management  information  systems;  (ii)  heavy  reliance  on  short-term \nborrowing; (iii) weak financial management capacity; (iv) limited human resources in internal audit; \n(v) limited capacity for rural enterprise financing; (vi) inadequate internal control mechanism; and \n(vii) a lack of policies on know-your-customer, risk management, and information technology. \n41.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and SFDB. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 26). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n42.  The project will generate employment or provide income earning opportunities to at least \n30,000 small farmers, including at least 12,000 women. By involving subsistence small farmers \nin rural enterprises, these farmers can gain better prices from their produce. Currently, 75% of \nSFAC members are women. However, majority of women members have limited credit history \nand  entrepreneurship  skills.  The  project  will  develop  women\u2019s  entrepreneurship  skills  with \nappropriate client protection. The project is classified gender equity as a theme.32 \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n43.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and relevant Operations \nManual definitions, the project\u2019s safeguard categories are as follows.33 \n \n44.  Environment (category FI). The project\u2019s environmental due diligence found the existing \nSFDB financed collective enterprises as category C. However, so as not to exclude the potential \ncategory B subprojects, implementation of an environmental and social management system \n(ESMS) is made mandatory. \n \n45.  Involuntary resettlement (category FI-C); Indigenous peoples (category FI). Only \nsubprojects not requiring any involuntary resettlement will be financed. The project can have \npositive impacts for indigenous peoples by providing them access to finance. If indigenous \npeoples safeguards are triggered, SFDB will follow the ESMS and ADB\u2019s requirements for \nindigenous peoples. \n \n46.  SFDB developed an ESMS, which was agreed by ADB. Subproject screening will be \nmandatory for all subprojects to be financed under the project, and SFDB will report on the status \nof the screening checklist to ADB. SFDB will do the following: \n \n(i)  Its regional offices will screen all subprojects to be financed under the project to \nensure compliance with government regulations, project legal agreements, the \nPAM, and environmental and social screening guidelines. \n \n(ii)  It  will  exclude  all  subprojects  categorized  A for  environment and  indigenous \npeoples, and A and B for involuntary resettlement. For category B subprojects, \nSFDB  will  prepare  an  initial  environmental  examination  and  environmental \nmanagement plan, or an indigenous peoples plan, and submit the appropriate plan \nfor ADB\u2019s approval, before the subproject is financed. \n                                                \n32 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n33 ADB.

ASSURANCES \n \n48.  The government and SFDB have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB requirements, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n49.  The government and SFDB have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the draft loan agreement and project agreement. The government has also \nagreed with ADB on the following conditions to the effectiveness of the loan agreement: (i) the \nsubsidiary  loan  agreement  between  the  government  and  SFDB,  in  form  and  substance \nsatisfactory to ADB, shall have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the government \nand SFDB, and shall have become fully effective and binding on the parties thereto in accordance \nwith its terms; and (ii) SFDB shall have provided evidence, in form and substance satisfactory to \nADB, that SFDB has obtained from NRB all necessary regulatory approvals to undertake its \nobligations under the Loan Agreement and the Project Agreement. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n50.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $50,000,000 \nto Nepal for the Rural Enterprise Financing Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in \nconcessional terms, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period \nand 1.5% per year thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such \nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nand project agreements presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n10 October 2019\n                                                \n34 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  13 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  \nImpact of the Project is Aligned with \nEmployment-oriented  economic  activities  increased  (14th  Three-Year  Development  Plan,  FY2017\u2013\nFY2019)a \nPerformance  Data Sources and \nIndicators with  Reporting \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks  \nOutcome  By December 2025     \nSmall farmers\u2019  a.
