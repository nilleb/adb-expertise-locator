The  Boao  Forum  for  Asia  (BFA)  was  established  in  2001  to  help  promote  the \ndevelopment  goals  of  and  encourage  closer  ties  among  Asian  countries  through  regional \ncooperation and integration. It provides a high-level forum for government officials, business \nleaders, and academics in Asia to discuss important policy issues and views pertaining to \nregional cooperation and integration in Asia and the Pacific.   \n \n2.  Since the beginning of the BFA, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported \nregional  policy  dialogue  and  training  programs,  including those  that  facilitate  public-private \npartnerships and training programs for export credit agency (ECA) officials to enhance their \nportfolio management. The partnership between ADB and the BFA was strengthened with the \nsigning of a memorandum of understanding on 22 April 2006. The proposed regional technical \nassistance (RETA)1 will help finance the activities of the BFA for 2008 and 2009 to carry out its \nprograms in support of regional cooperation and integration in Asia and the Pacific. The RETA \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Market-led  integration  in  Asia  has  fueled  policy  interest  in  establishing  new  cross-\nregional organizations in Asia and the Pacific. However, building political consensus on the \nstructure and functions of regional institutions is difficult in Asia and the Pacific, given its diverse \neconomics, politics, culture, geographic and demographic conditions. Consequently, building \nregional institutions in Asia and the Pacific is a long-term process that continues to rely on \nintergovernmental relations rather than on supranational institutions.  \n \n4.  The  BFA  continues  to  play  a  crucial  role  in  building  trust  and  confidence  among \ngovernments.  This  requires  strengthening  regional  policy  dialogue  and  disseminating \ninformation  effectively  among  the  countries  involved.  ADB  has  been  supporting  and  will \ncontinue to support the BFA in these two areas. In 2007, ADB sponsored a session entitled \n\u201cAccelerating Asian Growth: Evolution of the Asian Economic Community\u201d at the BFA annual \nconference. ADB Vice President Lawrence C. Greenwood moderated the session, which was \nattended by high-level business people and government officials. The session was well-received \nby the participants, and the BFA secretariat subsequently received positive feedback. ADB and \nthe BFA also jointly prepared the BFA Annual Report 20072. The report provides comprehensive \nanalysis on emerging trends in regional cooperation and integration. It was widely distributed to \nthe private sector, media, academia, and policy makers. The report is posted on the websites of \nADB and the BFA. \n \n5.  ADB will continue to support the BFA in promoting public-private partnerships in the \nregion. The BFA has started the critical process of building these relationships by providing \nvenues for interaction between governments and businesses at its annual conferences and \nother meetings. As part of their support for public-private partnerships, ADB and the BFA have \nestablished a partnership in strengthening the institutional capability of developing member \ncountries (DMC) in delivering official export credit at competitive rates and managing their \nportfolios. ADB's objective in helping the Asian export-import  banks, particularly those from \nDMCs,  is  to  enable  them  to  have  the  same  opportunities  as  their  export-import  bank \n                                                 \n1 The RETA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 4 January 2008. \n2 Boao Forum for Asia, 2007. Progress of Regional Cooperation and Integration in Asia and the Pacific. Annual \nReport 2007. Manila: ADB. \n ", "  2\ncounterparts  in  the  developed  world.  The  training  is  also  consistent  with  ADB's  regional \ncooperation and integration strategy to facilitate trade and investment among member countries \nthrough capacity building. ADB will continue the level of support it has provided to the Asian \nexport-import banks and will broaden its scope to cover more staff in those banks, as well as in \nthe ECAs in the DMCs that have not benefited from the ADB assistance. \n \n6.  The RETA will continue to support the BFA in strengthening regional policy dialogue and \nbuilding public-private partnerships to enable the DMCs in the region to maximize regional \ncooperation  and  integration  opportunities,  as  well  as  respond  adequately  to  the  related \nchallenges.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n7.  This RETA is consistent with ADB\u2019s regional cooperation and integration strategy in \nbuilding stronger partnerships with regional institutions that support cooperative activities in Asia \nand the Pacific.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The expected impact of the RETA will be (i) strengthened regional policy dialogue on  \nregional  cooperation  and  integration  issues  such  as  infrastructure,  trade,  and  investment; \nmoney and finance; and regional public goods; and (ii) improved public-private partnerships on \nregional cooperation and integration issues. \n \n9.  The  expected  outcomes  are  (i)  increased  awareness  of  the  involved  countries  on \nregional  cooperation  and  integration  issues;  and  (ii)  enhanced  capacity  of  selected  Asian \nexport-import banks and ECAs on topical issues, including public and private environmental risk \nmanagement,  infrastructure  financing  in  emerging  markets,  new  risk  mitigation  products, \ngovernments\u2019 management of contingent liabilities, and compliance with financial standards in \nAsia.  \n \n10.  The  expected  results  and  outputs  include  (i)  two  sponsored  sessions  on  regional \neconomic integration at the BFA annual conferences in April 2008 and April 2009; (ii) a BFA \nannual report (in April 2009); and (iii) training programs on the topics chosen by the export-\nimport banks and ECAs, with one training session to be held, as recommended, in Boao City, \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, back-to-back with the BFA annual conference, or in the ADB \nheadquarters in Manila, Philippines. The other training programs will be held in Manila or the \nmost  convenient  country  venue  for  the  participants,  which  will  be  identified  during  project \nimplementation. Expected trainees are from export-import banks and ECAs of DMCs.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The RETA will consist of two major activities: (i) support for the BFA conferences and \nannual report preparation, and (ii) training programs to support capacity development. \n \n12.  Support for the BFA Conferences and Annual Report Preparation. The targeted \naudience of the BFA annual conferences includes government, private sector (business and \nothers), and academic organizations. ADB and the BFA secretariat will coordinate closely on the \nmain themes of the BFA annual conferences for 2008 and 2009.   \n \n ", "3   \n13.  For the BFA annual conferences, the RETA will allocate funds (for honoraria, travel \ncosts, and other related expenses) to engage the services of resource persons and to cover \nother operating costs (venue rental, translator fees, etc). The BFA, in consultation with ADB, will \nregularly review the conference themes, which will be the basis for determining the expertise of \nthe resource persons who will be tapped for the training programs. \n \n14.  The BFA Annual Report 2009 will be published jointly by ADB and the BFA. International \nconsultants with expertise on the selected themes will be engaged to prepare the report The \nBFA Annual Report 2009 will be posted on the BFA and ADB websites.  \n \n15.  Training Programs and Workshops on Export-Import Banks and ECAs. The training \nwill  be  held  in  Boao  City,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  at  ADB  headquarters,  or  at  other \nconvenient venues. For 2008, two training programs will be conducted under the RETA. Based \non earlier consultations with the Asian export-import banks, the priority topics for training in \n2007 and 2008, based on the needs of the Asian export-import banks and ECAs, are: (i) legal \nframework  of  each  member  country,  (ii)  internal  controls  of  Asian  ECAs,  (iii)  Asian  ECA \nbusiness reengineering processes, (iv) management of failed projects in Asian ECAs, and (v) \nhuman resource development in Asian ECAs. This list of priority topics will be updated after the \nmeeting of Asian export-import banks in 2009. From the priority topics, a training syllabus will be \ndeveloped. \n \n16.  The training materials will be compiled in a compact disc and disseminated to all DMCs. \nThe compilation will also be posted on the Asia Regional Integration Center website. ADB's \nOffice of Regional Economic Integration (OREI) and Office of Cofinancing Operations (OCO) \nwill implement the RETA. If the training is held in Boao City, ADB will coordinate with the BFA \nsecretariat on the arrangements and proceedings for the training. The training programs will be \nassessed after each training course through evaluation and feedback from the participants, \nresource persons, and relevant institutions. This feedback will allow revisions and adjustments \nto the program to reflect the needs of the participants.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The RETA is estimated to cost $500,000. The RETA will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe  Poverty  Reduction  and  Regional  Cooperation  Fund  funded  by  the  Government  of  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, and will be administered by ADB. It will cover remuneration, travel, \nand per diem for international and national consultants, resource persons, conference-related \nexpenditures, travel costs of participants, other training expenditures, publication of the annual \nreport and reference materials, equipment rentals, and miscellaneous expenses. A detailed cost \nbreakdown and proposed financing plan are in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The RETA will be executed by ADB and implemented by OREI and OCO, in close \ncollaboration with the BFA secretariat. OREI will lead the implementation of the support for the \nBFA annual conferences and annual report, while OCO will lead the implementation of the \ntraining for the export-import banks and ECAs. The BFA secretariat is expected to be involved, \nparticularly in deciding the overall conference themes and logistics and the protocol for the \ntraining courses.  \n \n19.  The RETA is expected to start in February 2008 and be completed in January 2010. \nInternational consultants will be chosen through a single-sourced selection method and will be \n ", "  4\nengaged intermittently for a cumulative maximum of 4 person-months to draft the BFA annual \nreport. Resource persons will be engaged cumulatively for 4 person-months to conduct the \ntraining programs. One national consultant, who will be engaged intermittently for a maximum of \n8 person-months, will mainly coordinate the training and assist the international consultants in \nthe preparation of the BFA annual report. The national consultant will be based in OREI. An \noutline of the terms of reference for the consultants and resource persons is in Appendix 3. ADB \nwill engage the consultants on an individual basis and in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (April  2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging consultants.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by
