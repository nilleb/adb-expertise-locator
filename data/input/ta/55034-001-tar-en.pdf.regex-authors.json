INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) to strengthen its capacity for the so-called Safe System approach to road safety \n(para. 5) and develop a plan to implement it.1 One area of particular concern for the PRC is the \nsafety of commercial vehicles. When commercial vehicles such as tour buses, trucks, and carriers \nof hazardous goods are involved in crashes, the casualty rates and severity tend to be high. In \n2019, 27.4% of fatalities and 13.5% of serious injuries from road crashes involved commercial \nvehicles.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  In 2018, the PRC registered 63,194 deaths related to road traffic.3 The 2018 World Health \nOrganization\u2019s Global Status Report on Road Safety estimated traffic deaths in the PRC at \n256,180 in 2016,4 for a traffic death rate of 18.2 per 100,000 people, compared to 58,022 country \nreported road traffic fatalities.5 It also reported that the average traffic fatality rate per 100,000 \npeople was 27.5 in low-income countries, 19.2 in middle-income countries, and 8.3 in high-income \ncountries. The PRC strives to achieve a fatality rate comparable to that of high-income countries. \nMany factors contribute to the high traffic fatality rate in the PRC, including rapid urbanization and \nmotorization;  unforgiving 6  and  car-centric  road  infrastructure;  inadequate  standards  and \nenforcement; and unsafe user behavior such as distracted driving, speeding, and failure to use \nseatbelts, helmets, or child-restraints. \n \n3.  Road safety in the PRC is governed by multiple regulatory agencies. Road policies for \ncommercial vehicles are set and enforced by the Ministry of Transport (MOT), vehicle standards \nare the responsibility of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and the enforcement \nof law against behaviors such as speeding is under the jurisdiction of the Traffic Administration \nBureau of the Ministry of Public Security. Driver well-being and qualification checks are the \nresponsibility of operating companies. Poor collaboration between these different stakeholders \nand the lack of unified road safety targets limit the effectiveness of measures to improve road \nsafety. MOT is seeking ways to improve the road safety management of commercial vehicles by \napplying Safe System practices.7 \n \n4.  MOT estimates that 85%\u201390% of serious traffic crashes involving commercial vehicles are \ncaused by driver behavior\u2014e.g., fatigue, distracted driving, speeding, overloading, using rural \nroads not designed for commercial traffic, and driving despite poor mental health and well-being. \nHowever, many factors contribute to fatal crashes and serious injuries, and MOT is aware that \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) website on \n21 September 2021. \n2  Information provided by MOT during the ADB reconnaissance mission. 2021. Beijing.  \n3  National Bureau of Statistics of China. 2018. China Statistical Yearbook. Beijing. \n4  World Health Organization. 2018. Global Status Report on Road Safety. Geneva.  \n5  The World Health Organization estimates are based on the number of reported deaths, with adjustments made to \naccount for differences in definitions of road traffic deaths across multiple countries. The Global Status Report on \nRoad Safety is published every 5 years. The 2018 report published data from 2016. \n6 Unforgiving infrastructure plays a major role in the frequency and severity of run-off-road crashes. According to \nMonash University, this is often due to the position and rigid nature of roadside hazards (fixed objects such as trees, \nsigns, light polls) and shoulders which are unsealed, uneven or too steep. These conditions increase the risk of \nserious injury or death. \n7  The Safe System approach accepts that human beings make mistakes that lead to road crashes but also stipulates \nthe (i) shared responsibility of those who design, build, manage, and use roads and vehicles; (ii) shared duty of \nproviding post-crash care to prevent crashes resulting in serious injury or death; and (iii) need to strengthen all parts \nof the system simultaneously to multiply their effects, so that if one part fails, road users are still protected. \n \n ", "2 \nmerely blaming driver behavior means overlooking the importance of adequate road infrastructure \nand the setting and enforcement of speed limits and vehicle safety standards. It accepts the \nchallenge of moving beyond traditional thinking to a comprehensive approach. \n \n5.  The countries that were most successful in reducing road fatalities, such as Sweden, the \nUnited Kingdom and the Netherlands, have recognized that humans will always make mistakes \nand that there are physical limits to the forces the human body can withstand before sustaining \nserious injury or death. These countries focused their efforts on implementing a road transport \nsystem that accommodates and minimizes the impact of road user mistakes.8 Road safety \nmanagement  requires  shared  responsibility,  especially  among  road  system  designers  and \noperators; recognition of human fallibility and frailty; and holistic thinking on how to improve the \nsafety of all parts of the system\u2014vehicles, roads, and users\u2014to reduce the likelihood of death \nand serious injury. This approach, known as Safe System, is considered best practice. \n \n6.  The PRC took steps in this direction by adopting the ISO39001:2012 standard\u2014Road \nTraffic Safety Management Systems: Requirements with Guidance for Use\u2014in 2019, which calls \nfor risk-based thinking and the achievement of road safety results through the Safe System.9 \nHowever, the country needs an institutional framework, action plan, and capacity strengthening \nto shift the notion of road safety management away from a mere focus on user behavior. MOT \nrequested assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on how to implement the Safe \nSystem in the PRC and use it to improve the safety of commercial vehicles. \n \n7.  The TA will include practical guidance on the implementation of Safe System practices \nand will equip the PRC with the necessary skills to respond to road safety challenges and fulfill \nits commitments to the Sustainable Development Goals.10 The TA activities are aligned with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 203011 and its country partnership strategy, 2021\u20132025 for the PRC, which stress \nthe importance of reducing carbon emissions from transport and improving infrastructure for \nvulnerable groups.12 Road safety improvements are crucial to encouraging active mobility and \naugmenting safety of vulnerable road users, particularly children and the elderly.13 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: significant improvement in smart, intelligent, \nsafe, green, and shared transportation development achieved.14 The TA will have the following \noutcome: Safe System-based road safety management improved in the PRC, which will be \nevidenced by the adoption of a practical recommendation to improve road safety management \n \n8  World Health Organization. 2017.

Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Plan to implement the Safe System approach to road safety in the PRC \ndeveloped. An implementation plan will be developed based on the fundamental principles of the \nSafe System. First, the plan will detail the steps required to shift the road safety approach in the \nPRC to the Safe System. This includes specific direction on how to address the seven institutional \nmanagement functions for road safety.15 Second, the plan will provide guidance on how to \ndevelop  policies  and  action  plans  so  that  Safe  System  principles  such  as  forgiving  road \ninfrastructure,16 safer vehicles, and effective enforcement are put into practice for the benefit of \nall road user groups. Specific attention will be given to the safety requirements of vulnerable road \nusers such as pedestrians, cyclists, and other human-powered transport means. Finally, the plan \nwill (i) recommend mechanisms for cross-department and cross-jurisdiction collaboration; (ii) \npresent case studies that illustrate international best practice  in applying the Safe System \napproach;  and  (iii)  include  a  multisector  action  plan,  agreed  with  key  stakeholders,  with \nsequenced activities to develop, implement, and monitor an effective national road safety strategy. \nThe recommendations and action plan, prepared in the form of a handbook, will help achieve the \noutcome of strong, Safe System-based road safety management. Innovative technologies and \ntechniques for safety management, crash analysis, and other road traffic control measures will be \nexplored. \n \n10.  Output  2:  Capacity  for  the  road  safety  management  of  commercial  vehicles \nenhanced. This will involve the development of a framework to improve the road safety of specific \nclasses of commercial motor vehicles in the PRC based on the Safe System approach, and an \naccompanying capacity strengthening program. The framework will include (i) the benchmarking \nof  current  commercial  vehicle  management  practices  against  international  best  practice, \n(ii) recommended actions for MOT to improve the control of commercial vehicles from a proactive \nsafety management angle, and (iii) case studies and examples of international best practice that \nunderpin better commercial vehicle safety. This will be complemented by a training program to \nimprove road safety management capacity, covering topics such as (i) Safe System thinking with \na focus on shared responsibility, the failing human being, the system perspective, and effective \ncommunication and collaboration; (ii) fatigue management on the part of commercial vehicle drivers; \n(iii) action against high-risk behavior and enforcement of traffic rules; (iv) commercial vehicle \nstandards and effective vehicle inspection; and (v) effective training, licensing, and management of \ncommercial  vehicle  drivers.  This  output  will  require  consultations  with  multiple  stakeholders, \nincluding the private sector. Their experiences and the output's findings and recommendations will \nassist MOT in achieving better road safety in the PRC. \n \n11.  Output 3: Regional knowledge of the Safe System approach to commercial vehicle \nsafety enhanced. The research carried out under outputs 1 and 2, as well as the insights gained \nfrom implementing the Safe System in the PRC and improving the road safety of commercial \nvehicles will be shared through the Regional Knowledge Sharing Initiative, launched by ADB and \nthe government,17 and international forums such as the Asia Pacific Road Safety Observatory. \n \n15 The seven World Bank institution management functions are: (i) results focus; (ii) coordination; (iii) legislation; (iv) \nfunding and resource allocation; (v) promotion; (vi) monitoring and evaluation; and (vii) research and development, \nand knowledge transfer. \n16 Forgiving road infrastructure aims to protect vehicle occupants from serious injury in the event they leave the \nroad/carriageway. \n17 ADB\u2013PRC Regional Knowledge Sharing Initiative. https://rksi.adb.org/. \n \n ", "4 \n12.
