INTRODUCTION \n1.  As one of the main drivers of competitiveness, knowledge is profoundly shaping patterns \nof economic growth and development. Developing countries that fail to transform effectively into \nknowledge-based economies (KBEs) will fall further behind more advanced countries, widening \nthe disparities between developed and developing economies. The critical role of knowledge \nand innovation in enhancing productivity and growth was underscored in the flagship publication \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Asia 2050: Realizing the Asian Century.1 The report \nconcludes that pursuing a development process driven by effective creation, dissemination, and \napplication of knowledge will be essential for countries in Asia to avoid the middle-income trap. \n2.  In  the  past,  robust  growth  rates  of  Asian  economies  were  largely  attributable  to \nincreases in physical capital and labor inputs; knowledge, innovations, and entrepreneurship \nplayed a smaller role. However, policy makers and academics increasingly agree that sustaining \nAsia\u2019s  growth  and  dynamism  will  require  knowledge-based  development.  The  proposed \nresearch and development technical assistance (TA)2 will focus on what developing Asian \ncountries must do\u2014in terms of policy reforms and investments in knowledge infrastructure\u2014to \nbecome KBEs. The TA will analyze key attributes of KBEs in the context of developing Asia for \npromoting inclusive and sustainable growth, avoiding the middle-income trap3, and rising further \nup the value chain of manufacturing and global trade. The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.   The term KBE usually refers to an economy that produces, disseminates, and applies \nknowledge to drive competitiveness and achieve environmentally sustainable and inclusive \ngrowth.  The  KBE  measure  used  by  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment (OECD) covers three elements: information and communication technology (ICT); \nscience, technology, and innovation; and skills, education, and knowledge-based employment.4 \nThe World Bank\u2019s Knowledge Economy Index (KEI) has four pillars: economic incentives and \ninstitutional  regime,  education  and  human  resources,  the  innovation  system,  and  ICT \ninfrastructure. Evidence indicates that countries that score higher on the KEI have higher levels \nof economic development and vice versa.5 Higher KEI values are also associated with higher \nrates of future economic growth. Taipei,China; Hong Kong, China; Japan; the Republic of Korea; \nand Singapore score high on the KEI. However, a large number of countries in developing Asia \nare yet to embark on a full-scale knowledge-driven development process and have lost ground \nin the KEI. Given the region\u2019s high growth rates, this could imply that knowledge has not kept \npace with advances in manufacturing in developing Asia.  \n \n4.  Driven by rapid growth, many developing countries in Asia are at or are approaching \nmiddle-income levels. If developing Asia is to maintain its high growth rates, its knowledge \neconomies need to advance, diversify, and lead to the commercially successful application of \nscience,  technology,  and  innovation.  Productivity-driven  growth  based  on  more  and  better \nknowledge will enable middle-income countries to avoid the middle-income trap and low-income \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2011. Asia 2050: Realizing the Asian Century. Delhi: Sage. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 July 2012. \n3  The middle-income trap occurs when countries are unable to compete with low-income, low-wage economies in \nmanufactured exports and with advanced economies in high-skill innovations. Such countries cannot make a timely \ntransition from resource-driven growth with low-cost labor and capital to productivity-driven growth. \n4  OECD. 1996. The Knowledge-Based Economy. Paris. \n5  World Bank. 2007. Building Knowledge Economies: Advanced Strategies for Development. Washington, DC. \n ", "2  \ncountries to climb faster to middle-income levels. Knowledge needs to be put to work in Asia as \n(i)  a  driver  of  competitiveness  and  productivity  growth,  (ii)  a  facilitator  of  welfare  and \ndevelopment, and (iii) an enabler of better institutions and good governance.     \n \n5.  To transition to KBEs, developing Asia must have advanced ICT infrastructure, a highly \neducated workforce, dynamic research and innovation programs, and a supportive regulatory \nenvironment.6  The following key issues need answering: \n(i)   What do middle-income countries need to do to upgrade their industries based \non knowledge-intensive sectors, and thus avoid the middle-income trap?  \n(ii)   What  do  low-income  countries  need  to  do  to  leverage  knowledge-based \ndevelopment in order to leapfrog onto a faster growth path?  \n(iii)   What  kind of  investments  in knowledge  assets  are  required  for  countries  at \ndifferent stages of development to augment production, dissemination, and use \nof knowledge?  \n(iv)   What are the most promising avenues for using knowledge as a tool to promote \ninclusive growth?  \n \n6.  While the issue of what constitutes a KBE has been sufficiently analyzed, it would be \nuseful for developing Asia to know more about the policies and interventions needed to advance \nsystematically  on  the  knowledge  frontier.  The  heterogeneity  of  those  countries  requires  a \ndifferentiated  analysis  of  knowledge-based  development  in  low-income  and  middle-income \neconomies. An analysis is also needed of how investments in knowledge assets and policy \nreforms  can  be  successfully  sequenced  by  developing  countries  with  different  contexts, \nendowments, and competitive strengths. The TA will enable a systematic analysis of the most \npromising avenues for developing Asian countries to advance knowledge-based development to \navoid the middle-income trap, rise faster up in the global value chain, and facilitate inclusive and \nsustainable growth.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.   The impact will be the adoption of effective policies and investments by developing \nmember  countries  (DMCs)  toward  advancing  as  KBEs.  The  outcome  will  be  improved \nknowledge of DMCs on policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms, and financing requirements \nand options for KBEs.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The  TA  will  help  DMCs  to  put  in  place  policies,  regulatory  regimes,  and  incentive \nstructures  that  will  accelerate  knowledge-based  development.  The  TA  will  facilitate  the \nevaluation of new paradigms for knowledge economies that can advance economic growth and \ninclusive and environmentally sustainable development in Asia. The study will shed light on the \nright  combination  of  policy,  strategy,  and  investment  choices  appropriate  for  countries  at \ndifferent stages of development. The study will analyze the pillars of KBE: (i) education and \ntraining, (ii) information infrastructure, (iii) regulatory regimes, and (iv) innovation. \n \n9.  Education  and  training.  A  society  of  skilled,  flexible,  and  creative  people  with \nopportunities for quality education is essential to advance knowledge economies. Of the top 50 \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2007. Moving Towards Knowledge-Based Economies: Asian Experiences.

Information  infrastructure. The penetration of mobile and wireless technologies is \nenabling Asian economies to leapfrog on the technology frontier. Mobile data traffic is projected \nto grow at a cumulative average growth rate of 78% from 2011 to 2016. Asia and the Pacific and \nWestern Europe will account for more than half of global mobile traffic by 2016.9 The next \nfrontiers of ICT need to be analyzed for affordable and dispersed applications, along with an e-\ninclusion strategy to mitigate the digital divide.  \n  \n11.  Regulatory regime. Policies and regulatory regimes related to industry, competition, \nand intellectual property rights can encourage or impede knowledge economies. Predictable \npolicies allow firms to generate, adapt, and adopt new know-how and technologies.10 The study \nwill  examine  how  governments  can  encourage  firms  to  invest  more  in  research  and \ndevelopment, or act as an angel investor (an investor who provides financial backing for small \nstartups or entrepreneurs). The study will also explore how Asia\u2019s fast-growing economies can \nstrike the right balance between public and private sector roles in industry, financing, and \nresearch and development.   \n \n12.  Innovation. Future economic growth must increasingly be sustainable and inclusive, \nand be derived from innovation-induced productivity growth.11 A robust science and technology \nbase is crucial for innovations to flourish. From serving the elite few, innovations now need to be \ndirected at products and services that can reach underserved mass markets. The study will \ntherefore explore opportunities for inclusive innovation. \n \n13.  Key  activities  will  include  the  collection  of  primary  and  secondary  data,  empirical \nanalysis of the data, and the development of policy recommendations based on the analysis. \nCase studies of advanced countries that have successfully become KBEs will be documented \nand disseminated for developing Asia. While drawing on relevant international experience, the \nstudy  will  focus  on  solutions specific  to  developing  Asian  economies  at  different  levels  of \ndevelopment by providing practical policy and investment recommendations. Workshops will be \nheld to discuss the main findings that emerge as the research project proceeds to better \narticulate policy recommendations for DMCs.    \n \n14.  The  TA  will  improve  DMCs\u2019  knowledge  of  the  options  for  policy,  regulatory,  and \ninstitutional reforms and financing solutions for advancing KBEs in Asia. Ministries of finance, \nplanning, education, and labor, as well as educational institutions and science and technology \nbodies, will become aware of best practices to strengthen KBE development processes.   \n                                                 \n7 Times  Higher  Education  World  University  Rankings  2011\u20132012.  http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-\nuniversity-rankings/2011-2012/engineering-and-IT.html \n8  World Bank.

The primary output of the TA will be a strategic report comprising (i) thematic chapters \non enabling conditions and success factors for KBEs, and specific policy recommendations to \nDMCs on advancing KBEs; (ii) country chapters for a few selected developing countries and \ncase studies of successful applications of policy and practice for KBEs in developed countries; \nand (iii) policy recommendations on the way forward for developing Asia.  \n \n16.  The  secondary  outputs  of  the  TA  will  be  a  high-level  strategic  seminar  for  the \ndissemination of the findings and recommendations to policy makers of DMCs and other key \nstakeholders in the region, and a communication plan for taking forward the findings of the study. \nAn international seminar is planned at the 46th Annual Meeting of the ADB Board of Governors \nin 2013 to discuss the preliminary findings and recommendations of the study. Thereafter, the \nstudy report will be finalized, with a communication package to be presented at a final workshop. \n \n17.  The  primary  assumptions  include  (i)  accurate  and  up-to-date  data  and  information \navailable for analysis, (ii) effective communication of key findings and recommendations, and (iii) \nsufficient  commitment  from  governments  and  stakeholders.  The  main  risks  include  (i) \ninsufficient engagement of key stakeholders in government, business, and academia with the \nstudy; (ii) insufficient sharing of data and information; and (iii) exogenous shocks that shift the \nfocus and priority on knowledge economies. \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $1,000,000, and will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The financing will cover the \nremuneration  and  travel  expenses  of  international  and  national  consultants  and  resource \npersons, workshops and conferences, publications and knowledge products, and miscellaneous \nadministration expenses. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB will be the executing agency of the TA. The TA will be implemented jointly by \nADB\u2019s  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  (RSDD)  and  Economics  and \nResearch Department in coordination with other key departments. An ADB interdepartmental \nworking  group  co-chaired  by  the  director  general,  RSDD  and  the  chief  economist  will  be \nestablished to provide a forum for discussion on the implementation of the project and to review \ninterim and final outputs. The working group will include participants from the ADB\u2019s regional \ndepartments,  the Office of Regional Economic Integration, and Strategy and Policy Department. \nA team of ADB staff from RSDD and the Economics and Research Department will oversee the \nresearch and analysis to be conducted by international and national consultants, and will lead \nthe preparation of the report. ADB staff will also contribute to the writing of sections or chapters \nof the report. RSDD will lead overall project coordination and management. \n \n20.  A high-level panel will be established under the TA, comprising eight internationally \nrecognized experts, to provide strategic guidance to the research study and to develop a set of \ncritical policy recommendations appropriate to DMCs at different levels of development. Drawn \npredominantly from Asia, the members will bring expertise in economics, finance, trade, industry, \nthe corporate sector, and regulatory frameworks. External members of the high-level panel will \nbe engaged as resource persons for 10 person-days each.  \n \n ", "  5\n21.   International and national consultants will be recruited. The individual consultants will \ninclude (i) an international innovation policy and technology expert and team leader (4 person-\nmonths);  (ii)  an  international  knowledge  economy  specialist  (5  person-months);  (iii)  an \ninternational  ICT  expert  (3  person-months);  (iv)  an  international  education,  science  and \ntechnology, and industry expert (3 person-months); (v) national thematic experts in specific \ndisciplines (11 person-months) and national research assistants (11 person-months); and (vi) \nlocal consultants for administrative support (15 person-months). Local consultants will provide \nadministrative support. Individual consultant recruitment is proposed for all positions to select \nthe best combination of thematic experts in the shortest time. The outline terms of reference are \nin Appendix 4.  \n \n22.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time).   \n \n23.  Disbursements under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n24.  The TA will be implemented in two stages. During the first stage in September\u2013October \n2012, ADB and the international consultants, with guidance from the high-level panel, will \nprepare a detailed design for the study\u2014finalizing the scope, thematic areas, country coverage, \nmethodology,  and  implementation  plan.  Based  on  the  detailed  study  design,  the  terms  of \nreference and areas of expertise of the national experts will be finalized. The second stage of \nthe study will be from October 2012 to September 2013, with dissemination activities until \nDecember  2013.  Fieldwork  will  not  start  in  a  DMC  unless  a  no-objection  letter  has  been \nobtained from the government. The outline of the draft report in Appendix 3 is indicative.  \n \n25.  In addition, strategic partnerships with relevant institutions, such as the Republic of \nKorea\u2019s Knowledge Sharing Program, will be pursued during implementation. The objective of \nthese partnerships will be to learn firsthand from successful cases in the region.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n26.
