INTRODUCTION \n1.  The proposed regional technical assistance (TA) responds to the recommendations \nmade by the leaders of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) countries1 at their 3rd summit \nheld in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) in March 2008, which called for the \nintegration of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the GMS into regional value chains \n(RVCs) and global value chains (GVCs).2 These value chains would take advantage of the \nopportunities presented by the GMS transport routes and help expand the economic activities \nbeyond the confines of these routes. The 15th GMS Ministerial Conference, held in Thailand in \nJune 2009, endorsed the East\u2013West Economic Corridor (EWEC) strategy and action plan, \nwhich articulated two activities along the EWEC\u2014mapping of RVC and GVC opportunities for \nSMEs, and strengthening the capacity of local chambers of commerce and industry\u2014to respond \nto such opportunities. The proposed TA supports these activities, and is included in the program \nof nonlending products and services for 2009 in the indicative regional cooperation operations \nbusiness plan (2010\u20132012).3 GMS governments have indicated their concurrence with the TA \nimpact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference. The design and monitoring framework of the TA is in Appendix 1.4 \n \n2.  The  TA  is  in  line  with  a  strategic  priority  of  the  regional  cooperation  strategy  and \nprogram of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the GMS,5 in terms of integrating national \nmarkets to promote economic efficiency and private sector development. The TA is also one of \na  series  of  interventions  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners  that  seek  to  transform \ntransport corridors into economic corridors through transport and trade facilitation, logistics and \nurban  development,  and  value  chain  development.  ADB  has  undertaken  several  initiatives \nrelating to transport and trade facilitation, which have focused on implementation of a cross-\nborder transport agreement, development of sanitary and phyto-sanitary and national logistics \naction plans, coordinated border management, and a proposed corridor town development TA. \nThe proposed TA will build on the results of the regional TA for Facilitating Cross-Border Trade \nand Investment in the Greater Mekong Subregion,6 which assessed the capacity development \nneeds of local GMS chambers of commerce and industry (CCIs). 7 The TA will also build on and \n                                                 \n1  Comprising Cambodia, the People's Republic of China (Yunnan and Guangxi provinces), the Lao People's \nDemocratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n2  Value chains are a sequence of related and dependent value-added activities that begin with conception of a \nproduct or service and include the different phases of production, delivery to final consumers, after-sales services, \nand finally disposal and recycling. Value chains become regional or global when their component activities are \ngeographically dispersed across borders to locations in multiple countries, and they become functionally integrated \ninto new border-spanning business arrangements (O. Memedovic. 2007. Links between Local Clusters and Global \nValue Chains. Geneva: United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). \n3  ADB. 2009. Regional Cooperation Operations Business Plan: Greater Mekong Subregion, 2010\u20132012. Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 December 2009. \n5  The  GMS  strategic  framework  identified  five  strategic  thrusts:  (i)  strengthen  infrastructure  links  through  a \nmultisector approach, (ii) facilitate cross-border trade and investment, (iii) enhance private sector participation and \nimprove  its  competitiveness,  (iv)  develop  human  resources  and  skills  competencies,  and  (v)  protect  the \nenvironment and promote sustainable use of shared natural resources. \n6   ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance for Facilitating Cross-Border Trade and Investment in the Greater Mekong \nSubregion. Manila (TA 6228-REG). \n7   These are CCIs of provinces situated along the EWEC, and have a mandate to promote trade, investment, and \ntourism in their respective provinces. They advocate the rights of and seek to develop business opportunities for \ntheir  members,  most  of  which  are  SMEs.  Local  CCIs  can  facilitate  business-to-business  networking,  GVC \nawareness-raising for SMEs, and information dissemination to SMEs. They can link GVC participants, local \nproducers and local authorities. Local CCIs will participate in TA training courses, workshops, and trade forums. \nThey will act as trainers for SME capacity development training to be provided under future initiatives. \n ", "2  \ncomplement ongoing activities of the regional TA for Enhancing Transport and Trade Facilitation \nin the Greater Mekong Subregion.8 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.    GMS markets are fragmented, with cross-border flows of trade and investment taking \nplace only between major urban centers, or limited to certain nodal points. SMEs account for \nmore than 90% of enterprises in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam and around 65%\u201375% \nof enterprises in the PRC and Thailand. The majority of SMEs in the GMS are in the agricultural \nsector,  agro-industry  and  agribusiness.  Globalization  provides  an  important  opportunity  to \nintegrate SMEs and local producers into RVCs or GVCs. Most SMEs are unaware of (and lack \naccess  to)  RVCs  or  GVCs  and  related  international  production  networks.  Local  CCIs  and \nagencies responsible for SME promotion and development can play a critical role in advocating \nfor and promoting trade, investment, and SME development and integration into RVCs or GVCs, \nbut the capacity of local CCIs is limited and needs to be strengthened. GVC integration is also \nlimited by the weak industrial linkage between SMEs and multinational companies in GVCs.  \n \n4.    The  completion  of  the  EWEC  transport  infrastructure  provides  a  solid  basis  for \nincreased SME business opportunities and cooperation within the GMS with respect to RVCs or  \nGVCs and the development of subregional production clusters to increase productivity and \ncompetitiveness.9 To increase trade flows and integrate SMEs along the corridor into RVCs or \nGVCs, it is important that market-related product linkages among SMEs in relation to RVCs or \nGVCs be established. Strengthened and expanded linkages among key players in the selected \nvalue chains will increase the trade of goods and services among SMEs along the EWEC, and \ncontribute to its transformation into an economic corridor. \n \n5.  Integrating SMEs into value chains can be complicated by the difficulty small, isolated \nSMEs have in becoming part of value chains due their limited (i) internal capacity, (ii) accounting \nstructures, and (iii) ability to move upward in and meet the expectations and requirements of the \nvalue chain. Trade promotion and value chain integration are therefore best pursued through \nSME clusters. In the EWEC, local CCIs and SME promotion and development offices would \nwork  with  SME  clusters  to  provide  needed  information  services,  training,  and  other  trade \npromotion measures.  \n \n6.  By strengthening the capacity of local CCIs along the EWEC to promote inter-SME trade \nand RVC or GVC-related trade promotion, the TA will add value to ongoing ADB-assisted \nprivate sector and SME development programs in the Lao PDR and Viet Nam that aim to \nimprove the business and investment climate, undertake SME policy and legislative reforms, \nimprove the enabling environment for SME development, and expand SME access to finance. \nThe  TA  will  complement  value-chain-related  activities  undertaken  by  other  development \npartners in the GMS.10 The TA, in combination with other efforts undertaken by ADB and its \ndevelopment partners, will also address key factors limiting SME participation in value chains.  \n                                                 \n8  ADB.  2008.  Technical  Assistance  for  Enhancing  Transport  and  Trade  Facilitation  in  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion. Manila (TA 6450-REG). \n9  Clusters are groups of companies and institutions colocated in a specific geographic region and linked by \ninterdependences in providing a related group of products and/or services. \n10 For instance, the Japan International Cooperation Agency assisted Thailand in the One-Tambon-One-Product \nproject, which had a number of successes. Netherlands Development Organization carried out market-oriented and \nvalue-chain-related activities in eco-tourism, non-timber forestry products, rattan and handicrafts, and traditional \npaper in the Lao PDR. German development cooperation through GTZ carried out capacity development for the \nSME development and promotion office in the Lao PDR, and value chain activities in longan fruit and catfish in Viet \nNam. The World Bank undertook value chain studies in rice, coffee, maize, cattle, and potential for fruits, \n ", "  3\n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.   The impact of the TA will be an increase in the market-related product linkages between \nSMEs along the EWEC in relation to regional or global value chains.  \n \n8.  The expected outcome of the TA will be increased capacity of local CCIs to promote \ninter-SME and RVC or GVC-related trade.  \n \n9.   Increasing the capacity of local CCIs will enable them to help SMEs find markets \nthrough linkages with SMEs located within or outside the EWEC, or other enterprises linked to \nvalue chains; over time SME inputs would complement each other, resulting in the expansion of \nmarket-related product linkages among SMEs in relation to RVCs or GVCs. Market-related \nproduct linkages include those (i) among SMEs; (ii) between SMEs and larger organizations \n(e.g., international buyers); and (iii) between businesses (SMEs and/or larger enterprises) and \nexternal  institutions  (e.g.,  governments  and  educational  institutions,  but  in  particular  value \nchains).  Market-related  product  linkages  will  lead  to  increased  awareness  of  market \nopportunities, better appreciation of what is required to respond to such opportunities, initiatives \naimed at directly and/or indirectly improving the capacity of producers and SMEs to respond to \nmarkets, and increased awareness of regional and international buyers.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA aims to achieve the following key outputs: (i) a training program developed and \ndelivered for nine local CCIs11 along the EWEC in promoting inter-SME trade and value-chain- \nrelated  trade  promotion;  (ii)  action  plans  mapping  value  chain  integration  for  at  least  two \nproducts; (iii) an action plan on establishing EWEC production clusters; (iv) value-chain-related \ninformation disseminated to EWEC SMEs; and (v) a value-chain-related trade forum.  The TA \nwill therefore undertake the following activities: \n \n11.  Training program for local chambers of commerce and industry. This component \nwill (i) analyze a capacity development need assessment for local CCIs, which was conducted \nin 2008 under ADB TA (footnote 6), and design a relevant, efficient and effective training \nprogram for local CCIs; (ii) undertake consultations with the GMS Business Forum (GMS-BF), \nlocal CCIs, agencies responsible for SME development and promotion and other stakeholders \non  the  relevance,  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  training  program  developed;  and  (iii) \nconduct training workshops for nine local EWEC CCIs in (a) promoting inter-SME trade and \nRVC  or  GVC-related  trade  promotion;  (b)  CCI\u2014SME  interaction  in  promoting  cluster \ndevelopment; (c) facilitating the establishment of market-related product linkages among SMEs \nalong  the  EWEC;  and  (d)  information  management.  A  GMS  institute,  with  close  technical \n                                                                                                                                                          \nvegetables, and coffee in the Boloven Plateau, southern Lao PDR. Swiss Import Promotion Program had a number \nof small projects for organic fruit and vegetables, honey and bamboo shoots for Vientiane markets in the Lao PDR \nand activities relating to organic shrimp in Viet Nam. The United Nations Industrial Development Organization \ncarried out a project on wood processing and agro-business in central Lao PDR, and assists Cambodia, the Lao \nPDR, and Viet Nam with furniture and wood products standards. \n11 Local  CCIs  are  located  in  selected  provinces  along  the  EWEC: Tak,  Phitsanulok,  Khonkaen,  Kalasin  and \nMukdahan provinces in Thailand, Savannakhet province in the Lao PDR, and Quang Tri, Hue, and Da Nang \nprovinces in Viet Nam. \n ", "4  \nguidance  and  oversight  from  an  international  CCI  development  specialist,  will  develop  the \ntraining program.  \n \n12.   Action plans mapping value chain integration. This component will (i) build on the \nvalue chain scoping exercise conducted in 2009 with ADB TA (footnote 8) to carry out a detailed \nvalue chain feasibility study of agricultural produce, agribusiness and /or agro-processing sector \nin the GMS with high value-chain potential; (ii) undertake consultations with local CCIs, selected \nenterprises, relevant government departments, GVC firms, exporters, suppliers of different tiers \nand  producers  for  the  identified  agricultural  produce,  agribusiness  and/or  agro-processing \nsector; (iii) prepare action plans mapping value chain participation for at least two selected \nproducts; and (iv) produce 1,000 copies of value-chain-related brochures outlining the ways, \nsteps, requirements, and risks in value chain participation.  \n \n13.   Action  plan  on  establishing  production  clusters.  This  component  will  (i) collect \ninformation  on  the  spatial  distribution  of  production  along  the  EWEC,  and  examine  the \nprobability  of  organizing  production  clusters  according  to  the  comparative  advantages  and \nstrengths of geographic locations; (ii) review studies by other development partners and assess \nthe possibility of linking production clusters with the GMS free trade zone, and other special \neconomic zones and export-oriented zones; and (iii) prepare an action plan with a detailed \nfeasibility study on the establishment of production clusters. \n \n14.  Workshops for small and medium-sized enterprises. This component will (i) design \nthe value-chain awareness training workshops based on the value chain analysis, and action \nplans for value chain mapping and cluster development; (ii) undertake consultations with GMS-\nBF,  local  CCIs  and  agencies  responsible  for  SME  development  and  promotion  to  identify \nworkshop participants and venues, and plan the conduct of the workshops; and (iii) conduct \nworkshops  and  prepare  workshop  evaluation  reports.  SMEs  would  be  selected  through \nextensive consultations with CCIs, SME promotion and development offices in the project area, \nGMS-BF,  and  various  stakeholders,  with  a  focus  on  those  generating  value-chain  effects, \nincluding producers, different tiers of suppliers and higher-end distributors.  \n \n15.  Value-chain-related trade forum. This component will (i) prepare a shortlist of SMEs \nbased on their comparative advantages and potential to participate in RVCs or GVCs; (ii) \nidentify potential value chain retailers, distributors and/or exporters and suppliers to be invited; \nand (iii) organize a value-chain-related trade and investment forum. Invitations to participate in \nthe value chain forum will be extended to SMEs that have the potential to (i) transfer value-\nadded activities to large numbers of small farmer groups, and (ii) be successful models for \nothers. The selection will be carried out by CCIs in consultation with the project consultant and \nother stakeholders. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $660,000, of which $600,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  Investment  Climate  Facilitation  Fund12 under  the  Regional  Cooperation  and \nIntegration Financing Partnership Facility, and administered by ADB. The participating GMS \ngovernments will provide the remaining $60,000 equivalent in kind, in the form of counterpart \nstaff, logistical support, and other costs as they may arise. The detailed cost estimates are in \nAppendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n12  Established by the Government of Japan. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.   ADB's Southeast Asia Department will be the executing agency for the TA, and will \nreport its outcome to the GMS senior officials' meeting and the GMS ministerial conference. \nADB will closely work with (i) the GMS National Coordinator's Office; (ii) agencies responsible \nfor SME development and promotion in the GMS countries; (iii) GMS-BF; and (iv) central and \nlocal CCIs. The GMS-BF and local CCIs will be involved in TA activities such as local CCI \ntraining program development and delivery, value chain awareness workshops for SMEs and \nthe value-chain-related trade forum, including extensive consultations during preparation of the \naction plans for value chain integration mapping and development of the EWEC SME clusters.  \n \n18.    The TA will finance 7 person-months (international) and 23 person-months (national) of \nconsulting services, for a total of about 30 person-months. International consulting services will \ninclude 4.5 person-months for an international business development specialist, 1.5 person-\nmonths  for  an  international  CCI  capacity  development  specialist,  1  person-month  for  an \ninternational trade forum specialist; national consulting services include 8 person-months for a \nnational  business  development  consultant,  10 person-months  for  a  national  project \nimplementation  support  specialist,  and  5  person-months  for  a  national  event  organizing \nspecialist. Due to the variety of expertise required under different components, the consultants \nwill be selected on an individual basis. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 3. The consultants will be hired as individuals and engaged by ADB in accordance \nwith  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nDisbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook.13 \n \n19.   ADB will work closely with international and bilateral agencies in implementing the TA, \nincluding the European Union Regional Office, German development cooperation through GTZ, \nJapan  External  Trade  Organization,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  Netherlands \nDevelopment Assistance, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the \nPacific, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, and the World Bank.  ADB will \nalso cooperate with regional institutions involved in various aspects of capacity development for \nlocal CCIs, and facilitation of trade and value chain integration. ADB's TA implementation team \nwill work in close collaboration with GMS-BF in organizing the training workshops, seminars, \nand trade forum. The TA will be implemented over 20 months from April 2010 to November \n2011. \n \n20.   The expected outputs and outcome evaluation will be disseminated internally through an \nannouncement in ADB Today, a brown bag seminar, and workshop; and externally via the ADB \nwebsite and presentations to the GMS investment working group meeting. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n21.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund under the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Financing Partnership Facility for Strengthening Local Chambers of Commerce and \nIndustry along the East\u2013West Economic Corridor to Promote Trade, Investment and Value \nChains, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2008.
