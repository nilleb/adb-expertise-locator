Each \nsucceeding  subprogram  is to  be  processed  sequentially  upon \ncompletion of the preceding subprogram. \n   \nClassification  Targeting classification: General intervention \nSector (subsector): Finance (finance sector development) \nThemes (subthemes): Economic growth (promoting economic \nefficiency and enabling business environment), governance \n(economic and financial governance) \nLocation impact: National (high impact) \n   \nEnvironment  Category C \nAssessment \n   \nSocial Sector  Involuntary resettlement: Category C \nAssessment  Impact on indigenous people: Category C \nNo  involuntary  resettlement  or  impact  on  indigenous  people  is \nexpected from program implementation. \n   \nThe Program   With a rapidly growing commercial economy that requires a sound \nRationale    financial system to sustain its rate of growth, the Government needs \nto develop the financial sector by mobilizing financial resources\u2014\nchanneling  them  to  productive  investments,  and  managing  the \ninherent risks\u2014if it is to achieve long-term sustainable economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction. The Asian financial crisis of 1997\u2013\n1998  and  the  global  financial  crisis  that  began  in  2008  have \nprovided many examples of the devastating impact that financial \ncrises can have on countries, wiping out several years of growth \nwithin  a  very  short  time.  To  promote  economic  growth,  reduce \npoverty, and help countries prepare to mitigate shocks emanating \nfrom external financial crises, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nplays an important role in supporting financial sector development in \nits developing member countries, including Cambodia.  \n \nThe program loan cluster is supporting the Government\u2019s continued \nefforts  to  strengthen  the  financial  sector  by  supporting  a \ncombination  of  legal  and  regulatory  reforms,  targeted  capacity \nbuilding, improved disclosure standards and financial transparency, \nand establishment of key financial infrastructure. A sound, efficient, \nand integrated financial system is crucial for achieving broad-based \nsustainable  economic  growth.  It  helps  to  reduce  poverty  by \nincreasing job opportunities, lowering transaction costs of economic \nactivities, and extending the outreach of the formal financial sector \nto poor and rural areas. An efficient financial system will promote \nprivate sector development and foreign direct investment. A robust ", "ii   \n \nfinancial  sector  will  protect  the  economy  from  unfavorable \nexogenous  shocks,  which  are  becoming  more  common  in \nincreasingly global financial markets.     \n   \nObjective and Scope  The FSP II aims to promote the development of a sound, market-\nbased  financial  system  to  support  resource  mobilization  and \nsustainable economic growth. With a growing, resilient, and more \nefficient financial system as the expected outcome, subprogram 3 \nwill continue the following reform activities: \n \n(i)  Improve financial intermediation by upgrading the payments, \nclearance, and settlement system to support growing financial \nservices;  enhance  market  confidence  by  improving  public \nfinancial  disclosure  and  establishing  a  credit  information \nbureau;  support  market  development  by  establishing  an \ninterbank  market  and  tradable  government  securities;  and \nimproving the outreach of microfinance institutions (MFIs) in a \nsustainable manner.  \n(ii)  Enhance  resilience  of  the  financial  sector  by  revising  and \nupdating the law on banking and financial institutions, and by \nintroducing  supportive  regulations  to  strengthen  financial \nactivities;  tighten  prudential  supervision  and  regulations  of \nbanks and microfinance institutions; and build on the legal and \nregulatory foundation by adopting a new law on commercial \ncontracts  that  includes  specific  sections  on  agencies  and \nfranchising. \n(iii)  Promote  good  governance  by  implementing  international \ninitiatives on combating money laundering and the financing of \nterrorism,  by  enhancing  corporate  governance  and \ntransparency  in  the  insurance  industry,  by  establishing \ncommercial dispute resolution mechanisms, and by improving \nthe capability and increasing the number of qualified national \naccountants and auditors. \n(iv)  Enhance  efficiency  by  computerizing  the  management \ninformation system of the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC), \nas well as by upgrading the skills and capacity of microfinance \nagencies\u2019 staff.   \n   \nLoan Amount   A  loan  of  $10,000,000  equivalent  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s\nand Terms  Special Funds resources for subprogram 3. The loan will have a \n  24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years. The interest rate \n  will be 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter.  \n   \nProgram Period   The implementation period for subprogram 3 is January\u2013December \nand Tranching  2009. The loan will be released in a single tranche upon completion \nof specific tranche conditions and following loan effectiveness. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The  Government  will  use  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds \ngenerated by the loan proceeds to meet program expenditures and \nassociated costs of reform and additional budgetary allocation to \nhelp ease the effects of the global economic downturn. ", "iii \nExecuting and  NBC will be the Executing Agency, and the Ministry of Economy and \nImplementing Agencies  Finance  (MEF)  and  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC)  will  be  the \nImplementing  Agencies.  The  financial  sector  steering  committee, \nchaired by the governor of NBC and comprising senior officers from \nMEF, MOC, and NBC, will meet as required to review progress \nreports from the technical working group, consider pending issues, \nand  propose  concrete  actions  to  resolve  issues.  A  senior  NBC \nofficer has been appointed as program director to assist NBC, MEF, \nand MOC in coordinating day-to-day program implementation. The \nprogram director will submit quarterly progress reports to ADB on \nprogram implementation. \n   \nProcurement  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and \nprocured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and \nimports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  All \nprocurement of goods and services produced in, and originating \nfrom, ADB member countries will be made with due consideration to \neconomy  and  efficiency,  in  accordance  with  standard  public \nprocedures  in  Cambodia  and  normal  private  sector  commercial \npractices acceptable to ADB. In accordance with the provisions of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans (1998), the loan proceeds will be \ndisbursed to the Kingdom of Cambodia as the Borrower.  \n   \nRisks and   Program implementation could face a number of risks, for which \nSafeguards  mitigation measures have been put in place, as appropriate.  \n \n(i)  External  challenges  to  sustaining  economic  growth. \nCambodia\u2019s economic prospects must be viewed against a \nnumber of adverse developments in the external environment. \nThe unexpected surge in international energy and food prices \ntoward the end of 2007 fueled higher domestic inflation in the \nearly  part  of  2008  with  knock-on  effects  on  consumption, \ngrowth,  and  poverty.  The  Government  introduced  a \ncombination  of  fiscal  and  monetary  measures  to  moderate \ninflation, resulting in a slowdown in lending since late 2008. \nFalling  energy  and  commodity  prices  helped  to  ease  the \ninflation  rate,  which  reached  a  single  digit  in  early  2009. \nAlthough inflation was contained, other economic conditions \nwere affected in the fourth quarter of 2008 because of the \nspillover effects of the financial crisis that originated in the \nUnited  States  and  Europe,  causing  the  global  economic \nslowdown.  The  global  economic  downturn  has  negatively \naffected Cambodia\u2019s growth rate, as demand for Cambodia\u2019s \ngarments has reduced, tourist arrivals have fallen, and foreign \ninvestments  for  large-scale  construction  projects  have \ndeclined. As the garment, tourism, and construction industries \nare three of the four main drivers of growth, the economy is \nprojected to slow down to \u20131.5% (from 2.5%) in 2009 from an \nestimated 6.7% in 2008. The Government has further eased \n ", "iv   \n \nmonetary  policy  since  February  2009.  The  fiscal  deficit  is \nforecast  to  be  above  the  2009  approved  budget  to  create \nspace for fiscal stimulus. Because of uncertainty about the \nduration  of,  and  depth  of  impact  of  this  global  economic \ndownturn, the Government and ADB will continue to undertake \nperiodic  reviews  of  macroeconomic  and  financial \ndevelopments to assess potential risks to the financial sector \nthroughout subprogram 3. These reviews will continue through \nthe  program  period  for  subprogram  4.  Budget  assistance \nthrough  program  loans  in  2009,  including  through  this \nprogram, is being provided to bolster the economy\u2019s resilience. \n \n(ii)   Corruption and weak governance. Weak governance and \nincidents of corruption could erode investor confidence and \nprevent  the  attainment  of  expected  sector  outcomes.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  2006\u2013\n2010 views corruption as a threat to sustained growth and \ndevelopment of the country in general. Backed by an active \ndevelopment  community,  the  Government  is  increasingly \ntaking a tougher stance against corruption. The consensus is \nthat good governance and measures to address corruption are \nneeded for a successful partnership between the Government \nand the development community. This was considered during \ndesign of the program cluster, and there will be continuous \npursuit  of  improvements  to  the  institutional  governance \nstructure,  accounting  disclosure  standards,  financial \ntransparency,  complementary  legislation,  regulatory  updates \nand enforcement, supervision, and surveillance of the financial \nsector.  \n \n(iii)  Weak  institutional  and  human  capacity.  Some  of  the \nfinancial sector risks are associated with weak institutional and \nhuman capacity. The same applies to the implementation and \nenforcement of new laws and regulations. To mitigate those \nrisks, training programs have been initiated at various training \ninstitutions  established  during  the  first  Financial  Sector \nProgram.  Subprogram  3  provides  financial  support  to  the \ninstitutions to help update their curricula. The proposed TA \nthat is being processed separately will help reduce the risks \narising from weak capacity, especially in the implementation of \nall prudential regulations and in addressing new challenges \nemerging from the lower domestic growth caused by the global \neconomic  downturn.  With  these  design  safeguards,  the \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to far outweigh \nany costs.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance   In  connection  with  the  implementation  of  the  fourth  and  final \nsubprogram  of  the  Financial  Sector  Program  II  Cluster,  the \nGovernment has asked ADB for a capacity development technical \nassistance (CDTA) grant. The proposed CDTA is being processed \nseparately.  ", "     \nI.  THE PROPOSAL  \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for subprogram 3 of the Financial Sector Program II (FSP II).  \n \nII.  BACKGROUND \n \n2.  ADB has supported reforms in Cambodia\u2019s financial sector since 1999, beginning with a \ndiagnostic  assessment  of  the  financial  sector  and  formulation  of  the  Financial  Sector \nDevelopment  Blueprint  2001\u20132010.  The  blueprint,  updated  as  the  Financial  Sector \nDevelopment Strategy (FSDS) 2006\u20132015, was adopted by the Government in February 2007. \nThe FSDS provides the long-term objectives and development framework to guide and shape \nmedium-term policy design and implementation. The Government has, since 2001, been able to \nimplement important reforms in the financial sector with ADB assistance under the first Financial \nSector Program1 (FSP I) that concluded in August 2007 and with complementary assistance \nfrom the International Monetary Fund (IMF) poverty reduction and growth facility that ended in \n2003. Since implementation of the blueprint, there have been some notable achievements as \nwell as lessons from both domestic and international experience. Those experiences, coupled \nwith  the  need  to  support  continuing  development  of  the  financial  sector  to  meet  the  new \nchallenges, prompted the Government to request further support from ADB to enable continuing \nreforms in the sector. This led to design and approval of the FSP II cluster2 on 6 December \n2007. \n \n3.  The FSP II comprises a series of four single-tranche subprograms, to be implemented \nfrom  September  2006  to  December  2010,  within  a  well-defined  medium-term  framework \ninvolving  fundamental  reforms  to  be  completed  prior  to  consideration  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of \nDirectors  of  each  subprogram.  Subprograms  are  linked  by  key  actions  (triggers)  deemed \nessential for the success of the medium-term program. The overall goal of the FSP II is to \npromote the development of a sound, market-based financial system to enhance resource \nmobilization and support sustainable economic growth. The expected outcome is a growing, \nresilient, and efficient financial system. (The design and monitoring framework for the Program \nis in Appendix 1, including the achievements of subprograms 1 and 2 with TA support from \nADB. The policy matrix and medium-term program are in Appendix 2.)  \n \n4.  Subprogram 1 with 14 key reform actions was approved together with the FSP II cluster \nconcept on 6 December 2007. The loan agreement for subprogram 1 (footnote 2) was signed \non 18 February 2008 and the single tranche equivalent of SDR6,381,000 was fully disbursed in \nApril 2008. Subprogram 2 with 14 key reform actions (triggers) was approved on 5 December \n2008 after all policy triggers were completed.3 The loan agreement was signed on 8 December, \ndeclared effective on 22 December, and the single tranche equivalent to SDR6,618,000 was \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

Manila (Loan 2479-CAM). \n ", "2   \n \n \nreleased  on  23  December  2008.  ADB  provided  a  TA  grant  of  $300,000  to  support  the \nimplementation of key policy triggers of subprogram 3. With 11 policy triggers and 11 expected \nmilestones, implementation of subprogram 3 began in January 2009.  \n \nIII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT  \n \n5.  Global  economic  crisis  impact  economic  growth.  Cambodia  has  recorded  real \neconomic growth of over 9% throughout 2001 to 2008 (country economic indicators for 2004\u2013\n2009 in Table 1). With this continuous high economic growth, indications are that the incidence \nof overall poverty declined from 35% in 2004 to an estimated 30% in 2007. However, this gain \nmay be reversed if the effect of the global economic slowdown on Cambodia\u2019s economy is \nprolonged and the country\u2019s garment exports, tourism receipts, and foreign funding for large-\nscale construction projects continue to fall, as these are three of the four key engines for \nCambodia\u2019s economic growth. Exports of garments to the US and Europe, tourist arrivals, and \nforeign direct investment have fallen off sharply since the last quarter of 2008, contributing to \nthe slowdown in gross domestic product (GDP) growth to 6.7% in 2008. Garment export, which \naccounts for 16% of GDP, declined by 27% in the first 5 months of 2009; receipts from tourism, \nrepresenting 15% of GDP, declined by around 3%; and construction, which accounts for 7% of \nGDP, has slowed down because of the decline in foreign direct investment. Only agricultural \noutput (27% of GDP) is expected to show relatively strong growth (estimated at 4.3%) in 2009. \nADB has revised down economic growth for 2009 to \u20131.5% (from 2.5%) and projected economic \ngrowth to pick up moderately to around 3.5% (from 4%) in 2010. As a result, state revenues are \nexpected  to  shrink  by  about  1 percentage  point  of  GDP  in  2009,  from  11.9%  in  2008, \ncontributing to a larger budget deficit. On a positive note, the inflation rate, which peaked at \n25.1% in June 2008, declined into the single digits early this year (7.5 at the end of August \n2009) in line with lower fuel and food prices and easing domestic demand pressures (Figure 1). \nThis provides room for macroeconomic stimulus measures. \n \n6.  Strong but vulnerable external sector. With the projected slowdown in exports and \nservices, the external current account deficit widened to 16.5% of GDP in 2008 and is projected \nto narrow to 11.8% of GDP in 2009. The current account deficit will narrow as declining exports \nare expected to be partially offset by lower imports from the reduction in related inputs (fabrics, \nfood items, construction materials) and by lower fuel prices, resulting in an estimated overall \ntrade balance of \u201313%. Gross foreign reserves that reached a high of $2.2 billion at the end of \n2008  (4 months  of  import  cover)  have  remained  at  the  same  level  in  June  2009.  In  the \nmeantime, the authorities will continue to monitor the situation closely. \n \n7.  Pro-growth fiscal policy. The Government has maintained a prudent fiscal stance over \nrecent years and built up its deposits in the banking system to around 6% of GDP. The overall \nbudget deficit for 2008 was 2.7% of GDP compared to 2.8% in 2007, mainly financed by \noverseas sources. The 2009 budget, prepared before the onset of the global financial crisis, \nprojects an overall deficit of 3%\u20134% of GDP to be financed from foreign sources combined with \na drawdown of the accumulated fiscal reserve within the banking system. The Government \npositively considered the IMF\u2019s recommendation to allow the deficit to increase to 4.8% of GDP \nto provide added fiscal stimulus, especially in the wake of lower government revenues in 2009. \nGiven the projected economic contraction for Cambodia in 2009, an expansionary budget is \nappropriate to maintain social expenditures, and to stimulate economic growth including through \nhigher levels of capital spending. No new fiscal measures were introduced in 2009, and since \nAugust the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) started receiving proposals from ministries \nfor the 2010 budget. \n ", "      3   \n \nTable 1: Country Economic Indicators, 2004\u20132009 \nItem  2004    2005     2006    2007    2008    2009 \n           \nA.

Monetary conditions deteriorate and inflation contained. Fueled by rising foreign \ncapital inflows and bank deposits, broad money growth accelerated sharply, peaking at 63% in \nDecember 2007. This contributed to an unsustainable rate of growth in bank credit, which \nreached 102% year-on-year in May 2008. It also stoked inflation, which had been subdued until \n2007. Inflation was also sparked by supply-side shocks and surged from an annual rate of \n10.8% in December 2007 to peak at 25.1% in June 2008. The monetary authorities responded \nby imposing a 15% limit on bank credit to the real sector in June 2008 (subsequently removed in \nJanuary 2009), by doubling the minimum reserve requirement on foreign currency deposits to \n16% in July of the same year (subsequently reduced to 12% in January 2009), and by easing \nrestrictions on placement of excess reserves offshore. Later in the year, food and fuel prices \n ", "4   \n \n \ndeclined, and combined with the above monetary policy measures, helped bring down the \ninflation rate to 12.5% in December 2008 and 7.5%4 in August 2009.

Impact of the global financial crisis on the financial sector and policy responses. \nCambodia\u2019s financial sector is not directly affected by the global financial crisis, given that there \nis no capital market and the local financial market remains underdeveloped and is not integrated \ninto  the  world  or  regional  markets.  However,  Cambodia\u2019s  financial  sector  is  moderately \nvulnerable because of its exposure to the real sectors, which are being affected by the global \neconomic downturn, and also through the decline in foreign direct investments. The National \nBank of Cambodia (NBC), early in the year, took substantive actions in response to emerging \nstrains  on  the  banking  system  caused  by  tighter  liquidity  conditions  and  the  slowdown  in \neconomic growth. In particular, the removal of the 15% limit on banking credit to the real sector, \nreduction of the minimum reserve requirement from 16% to 12%, the creation of an overdraft \nfacility  to  manage  temporary  liquidity  risk  from  individual  banks,  improvements  to  the \nmanagement  of  the  reserve  requirement  system,  adoption  of  the  revised  regulation  to \nstrengthen asset classification and provisioning, and the strong commitment to improving the \nregulatory regime, bank surveillance, and enforcement of prudential regulations. Total liquidity is \ngradually improving and in August 2009 broad money supply recovered to 31% growth (year-\non-year) while growth of credit to the private sector is still declining. NBC is monitoring the \nliquidity position of banks and financial institutions on a daily basis and nonperforming loans \n(NPLs) on a monthly basis.   \n \n                                                 \n4  A new consumer price index methodology was adopted in April 2009 using 2006 as the base year. As a result, the \nconsumer price index data since 2006 have been revised. ", "      5   \n \n10.  Macroeconomic stability is crucial. Cambodia\u2019s economy is vulnerable to a number of \nadverse developments in the external environment. The sharp slowdown in the US, European, \nand major Asian economies together with recent turbulence in international financial markets \nhas indirectly affected growth conditions in Cambodia. Maintaining macroeconomic stability, \nincluding a low rate of inflation, is a necessary condition for the economy\u2019s diversification and \ngrowth recovery. Equally important is to limit the adverse impact of the economic slowdown on \nvulnerable segments of society. Cambodia has reserves sufficient for 4 months of imports, and, \nwhile these are normally adequate against external shocks, close monitoring of macroeconomic \nand financial developments is needed. Beyond the near-term, complementary structural reforms \nwill  be  required  to  address  Cambodia\u2019s  longer-term  development  challenges,  especially  in \nreducing poverty (particularly in rural areas) and narrowing urban\u2013rural income disparities. As a \ncontribution  to  the  financial  sector,  NBC  and  MEF  are  considering  ways  to  fast-track  the \nadoption of market-based instruments to help absorb excess liquidity whenever required and to \nbegin the development of interbank and capital markets. This is consistent with FSDS 2006\u2013\n2015 objectives. \n \nIV.  LINK BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND ADB STRATEGIES \n11.  Cambodia\u2019s 5-year National Strategic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 was prepared in \nthe context of a falling, but still high, incidence of overall poverty and a growing urban\u2013rural \ndivide. The plan aims to give effect to the Government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy (phase 2), \nadopted in October 2008, that sets out the Government\u2019s reform agenda as a series of four \ninterlocking strategies with enhanced governance at its core. One of the four strategies focuses \non the preconditions required to promote economic growth through agriculture, infrastructure, \nand  private  sector  development  while  enhancing  employment  and  human  resource \ndevelopment. \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s overarching goal in Cambodia is sustainable poverty reduction. In line with the \npriorities and strategies identified in the Government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy (phase 2), ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy and program5 focuses on three strategic pillars: (i) broad-based economic \ngrowth  through  investments  in  physical  infrastructure,  development  of  the  financial  sector, \nsupport for greater regional integration, sustainable development of small and medium-sized \nenterprises  (SMEs),  and  investments  in  agriculture  and  irrigation;  (ii)  inclusive  social \ndevelopment through basic education, empowerment of vulnerable groups such as women and \nethnic  minorities,  control  of  communicable  diseases,  provision  of  rural  water  supply  and \nsanitation facilities, and community-based sustainable management and conservation of natural \nresources in the Tonle Sap basin; and (iii) good governance through improvements in public \nfinancial management to enhance the development effectiveness of public expenditures and \ndecentralization initiatives to strengthen local participation in government and improve public \nservice delivery.   \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program specifically states that ADB will continue its leading \nrole  in  supporting  financial  sector  development  and  that  ADB\u2019s  future  involvement  in  the \nfinancial sector would depend on the successful update of the FSDS. The updated FSDS 2006\u2013\n2015 states that financial sector development is not an end in itself; rather, it is one aspect \nsupporting the development and reduction of poverty in Cambodia (Figure 2). While much work \nis  needed  to  achieve  this  difficult  goal,  accelerating  and  diversifying  growth  is  generally \naccepted as the key. Financial sector development must support this objective. Reform and \nchange are essential for growth. At the same time, expanding finance brings risks. Hence, the \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program (2005\u20132009): Cambodia.

Following the political instability and institutional destruction of the late 1970s and early \n1980s, Cambodia\u2019s financial system has been undergoing rapid development based on private \nsector participation. At the end of July 2009, the formal financial system comprised NBC, \n27 private commercial banks, 6 specialized financial institutions, 2 representative offices of \nforeign-based  banks,  20  licensed  and  25  registered  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs),  and \n7 insurance companies. Cambodia also has the objective of developing bond and securities \nmarkets in the near future. The predominantly rural nature of the economy, high transaction \ncosts,  and  low  creditor  confidence  have  been  the  main  factors  resulting  in  low  formal \nintermediation  and  outreach  within  the  financial  sector.  There  has  also  been  a  slow \ndevelopment of nonbank financial institutions, with a limited range of products and services \nbeing offered. A sector analysis is in Appendix 3.  \n \n15.  The  performance  of  Cambodia\u2019s  financial  sector  has  been  satisfactory,  though \nchallenging (refer to key financial data in Table 2). With a relatively strong banking subsector, \nfinancial deepening has accelerated with increased financial services promoted through the \nprogressive reforms implemented under the FSP I and II. The broad money supply (M2) to GDP \nhas risen from 20.5% of GDP in 2006 (before the FSP II) to 29.3% of GDP in 2008 (Figure 3). \nCredit to the private sector has correspondingly risen from 12.2% of GDP in 2006 to 23.6% of \nGDP in 2008. Total deposits to GDP was around 22.8% of GDP in 2008 compared to 17.9% of \nGDP in 2006. Despite these positive developments, policy gaps, implementation challenges, \nand capacity constraints still need to be addressed in each of the subsectors. Further, the sector \nis beginning to experience the stress of the indirect effects of the global economic downturn on \nCambodia\u2019s economy.  \n \n \n \nFigure 3:  Financial Interm  ediation, 2001\u20132008 \nFigure 3:  Financial Intermediation, 2001\u20132008\n \n \n35  \n \n \n30\n \n \n25\n \n \n20\n \n%   M2/GDP\n15  \n \n10  \n \n5  \n \n \n0\n \n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008\n \nYear\n \nM2 = broad money supply, GDP = gross domestic product.  \n \nSource: National Bank of Cambodia. \n \n \n \n ", "8   \n \n \nTable 2: Key Financial Data\n \n \n2009 \nIndicators    2001      2002     2003      2004     2005    2006     2007   2008  June \nM2 to GDP (%)  13.0  15.6  16.3  18.4  18.4  20.5  25.8  29.3  26.2 \nNumber of licensed \n33.0  32.0  17.0  17.0  18.0  20.0  24.0  30.0  32.0 \nbanks \nAverage CAR (%)  58.5  49.3  40.6  34.5  32.0  26.0  24.0  27.6  33.0 \nPrivate sector credit to \n6.0  6.3  7.2  8.5  9.3  12.2  18.3  23.6  20.8 \nGDP (%) \nNumber of loan \n68.2  86.8  105.3  123.9  145.2  164.9  197.3  230.1  246.8 \naccounts ('000) \nTotal deposits to GDP \n10.4  12.7  13.1  15.1  14.6  17.9  26.6  22.8  23.1 \n(%) \nNPLs/total loans (%)  8.1  14.6  12.7  9.6  7.3  9.8  3.4  3.7  5.2 \nAverage return on \n0.6  1.1  0.9  1.2  1.8  2.8  2.8  2.8  0.6 \nassets (%) \nAverage interest spread \n12.5  14.0  13.3  15.3  12.2  11.8  11.1  9.5  9.8 \n(%) \nTotal assets of five \nlargest banks/total  62.7  70.3  68.6  66.6  63.3  66.3  70.0  71.0  70.7 \nassets (%)        \nTotal deposits of five \nlargest banks/total  80.8  83.6  80.9  78.3  71.0  70.0  73.0  73.0  74.4 \ndeposits (%) \nNumber of licensed and   \n0.0  30.0  34.0  38.0  39.0  40.0  42.0  44.0  45.0 \nregistered MFIs \nTotal number of MFI \n410.0  328.0  265.0  322.0  368.0  471.0  624.1  852.1  825.1 \nborrowers (\u2018000) \nTotal amount of MFI \n35.9  51.3  32.6  40.9  49.2  92.2  160.1  284.7  262.5 \nloans ($ million) \nTotal amount of MFI \n3.8  7.1  2.5  2.0  1.9  2.9  6.1  6.4  6.1 \ndeposits ($ million) \nTotal number of MFI \n158.6  107.2  88.5  123.0  137.6  113.3  148.0  155.3  106.6 \ndepositors ('000)  \nNumber of insurance \n1.0  1.0  4.0  3.0  3.0  3.0  5.0  5.0  5.0 \nfirms \nTotal insurance \n3.6  5.5  8.8  10.1  10.8  13.0  17.5  20.7  8.4 \npremium ($ million)   \nCAR = capital adequacy ratio, GDP = gross domestic product, M2 = broad money supply, MFI = microfinance \ninstitution, NPL = nonperforming loan. \n    Sources: National Bank of Cambodia and Ministry of Economy and Finance. \n  \n16.

At  the  end  of  July  2009,  there  were  27  private  commercial  banks, \n6 specialized  banks  (including  one  state-owned  bank\u2014the  Rural  Development  Bank),  and \n2 representative offices of foreign-based banks in Cambodia. Most of the recent performance \nindicators suggest that the banking system is reasonably profitable, efficient, has adequate \nliquidity, and is well capitalized. On average, banks have maintained overall solvency at above \n25% since 2001 (33% in June 2009) compared to the minimum prudential requirement of 15% \n(Figures 4 and 5). Furthermore, the capital requirement for banks that are owned by nonbank \nentities was recently tripled from $13 million equivalent as a precaution against potential shocks. \nThe reported NPL ratio of banks has increased from 3.7% in December 2008 to 5.2% in June \n2009.

Microfinance. Microfinance has come a long way since licensing commenced in 2002, \nwith 20 licensed MFIs and 25 registered nongovernment-operated MFIs at the end of July 2009. \nThe microfinance industry is expanding rapidly, providing the link between the formal financial \nsector and rural households and microenterprises (Figure 6). The number of active borrowers \navailing of rural household credits, credit for agriculture, and small-business loans increased \nfrom 624,000 clients in 2007 to more than 807,335 clients (6% of the total population) in June \n2009, with potential for further growth. Microfinance lending also grew from $160.1 million in \n2007 to $262.5 million in June 2009, with reported NPLs rising from below 1% in December \n2008 to 3% in June 2009. Voluntary savings remain very small and access to local finance by \nMFIs has been very limited. With TA6 from ADB, NBC issued a prakas7 in December 2007 \nsetting out the criteria for MFIs that are eligible to mobilize voluntary public savings. Two MFIs \nhave been granted license to mobilize savings from the public and two other applications are \nbeing processed. Through NBC\u2019s encouragement, five commercial banks are now providing \ncredit facilities to MFIs and other commercial banks are being encouraged to provide this facility \nto help MFIs at a time when the global financial crisis is affecting offshore funding sources. \n \n \n  Figure 6: Development of Microfinance Institutions\n \n  0) 1,000\n0\n  0\n(' 900\n  rs  800\no\n  sit 700\no\n  p\ne 600\nD\n  d  500\nn\n  a\ns  400\n  er\nw 300\n  orro 200\n  B\n  o. of  1000\n  N\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009\n  Year\n \nNo. of Licensed and Registered MFIs No. of MFI Borrowers\n \nNo. of MFI Depositors \n \n  MFI = microfinance institution. \na The figures for 2009 are as of end June 2009.    \n \nSource: National Bank of Cambodia. \n   \n18.

Divesting government shares continues to be an important \nreform agenda item to allow MEF to perform its regulatory functions equitably. In November \n2008, the Government successfully sold 75% of its shares in Cambodian National Insurance \nCompany (Caminco). The insurance industry is very small, with a total premium income of $20.7 \nmillion in 2008 compared to $17.5 million in 2007 (Figure 7).

In 2005, only \n10 locally  qualified  accountants  were  working  in  the  country.  To  improve  accounting  and \nauditing capacity, the Government has been funding a scholarship scheme to assist at least \n70 candidates annually to meet the required certified public accountant (CPA) accreditation. In \nJanuary 2009, MEF issued a prakas on the promulgation of Cambodian Financial Reporting \nStandards based on the International Financial Reporting Standards. In addition, the National \nAccounting  Council  is  working  on  developing  accounting  standards  for  SMEs  based  on \ninternational standards and best practice. The World Bank is providing TA to the National \nAccounting Council to help revise and update the accounting law, and review the accounting \nframework to help improve the enforcement of the accounting and auditing standards.  \n \nB.  Emerging Challenges and Opportunities  \n \n21.  Global financial and economic crisis. The turmoil in international financial markets \nintensified in September 2008 following the failure of important financial institutions in the US \nand Europe, which froze interbank and credit markets around the world and pushed the price of \nrisk upward\u2014triggering a global liquidity shortage worldwide. Cambodia\u2019s banks have limited \ndirect exposure and the domestic capital and money markets have not been fully developed. \nThe  indirect  impact  of  the  global  economic  slowdown  on  Cambodia\u2019s  financial  sector  has \nmanifested in two ways: (i) on the liquidity of the banking system, as a result of declining foreign \ndirect investments and export receipts; and (ii) on the quality of credit exposure to the real \nsector, which are being affected by declining international and domestic demands. Banks that \nhave substantially increased their lending since 2007 are affected. The authorities have eased \nmonetary policy by reducing the minimum reserve requirement from 16% to 12%, and made \navailable  an  overdraft  facility  to  individual  banks  since  January  2009.  The  reported  NPLs \nincreased  from  3.7%  in  December  2008  to  5.2%  in  June  2009  and  are  expected  to  rise \ngradually during the year. The banking system has been resilient, with a strong overall solvency \nposition  of  33%  in  June  2009  compared  to  the  minimum  prudential  requirement  of  15%. \nFurthermore, the capital requirement for banks that are owned by nonbank entities was recently \ntripled from $13 million equivalent as a precaution against potential shocks. The authorities and \nADB  will  continue  to  monitor  financial  and  macroeconomic  developments  closely  during \nsubprogram 3.  \n \n22.     Underdeveloped commercial and institutional framework. As in other developing \neconomies, the fundamental weaknesses that stifle financial sector development in Cambodia \nstem mainly from its underdeveloped commercial and institutional framework, low formalized \nenterprise development, and limited human capacity and technical expertise. Previous decades \nof conflict that destroyed institutional structures and drained or in some instances wiped out \nqualified human resources, followed by a period of international isolation, resulted in weak \ngovernance and very low public confidence. The transition from a centrally controlled to a \nmarket-led economy and the speedy implementation of changes creates new forms of risk and \naccompanying opportunities for corruption. The commercial court system is being developed by \nother development partners to help enforce contracts and resolve commercial disputes. This \nshould increase public and investor confidence in the sector. Enterprises that have enjoyed \nmany years of operating without an established rule of law prefer to remain informal. The \nmajority of participants in the real sector are reluctant to enter into any form of formal financial \ntransactions for fear of being exposed to the tax authorities. To help mitigate these issues, \nefforts are under way to get the National Assembly to adopt the remaining commercial laws, \nhave  the  Government  establish  a  commercial  court  with  supporting  dispute  resolution \nmechanisms, and enhance institutional and technical capacity. \n ", "      13   \n \n23.  Rapid expansion of bank lending. Starting from a relatively small base, credit to the \nprivate sector has been expanding very rapidly, from a total stock of 12.2% of GDP in 2006 to \n23.6% in 2008. The year-on-year growth rate reached 102% at the end of June 2008 but \ndeclined to 54% at the end of December 2008. Credit, which is concentrated in a few banks, is \nalmost  entirely  collateralized  against  the  real  estate  market.  Some  banks\u2019  assets  are \nincreasingly  vulnerable  to  real  estate  risks.  In  early  2008,  NBC  issued  guidelines  to  help \nimprove banks\u2019 classification and reporting of exposure to housing, construction, and real estate \nloans. While reported system-wide NPLs remain below 10%, there are concerns about the \nquality of asset classification and reporting. NBC issued in February 2009 a revised regulation \non loan grading and provisioning by banks, based on the Basel 1 requirements, to help improve \nloan classification and reporting. The rapid credit expansion reinforces the critical importance of \nstrong banking supervision and enforcing compliance with prudential regulations while giving \npriority to assessing asset quality. ADB provided TA (footnote 8) to help introduce procedures \nfor on-site supervision and provide on-the-job guidance to NBC staff during the comprehensive \nreview of the six largest banks under subprogram 3.  \n \n24.  Bank  supervision  capacity  to  sustain  bank  soundness.  The  progressive \ndevelopment of bank supervision capacity through knowledge transfer is an ongoing process. \nThis is expected, given that the financial sector has had to be rebuilt over the past 10 years \nfollowing the internal conflict that destroyed institutional structures and either drained or wiped \nout  human  resources  in  most  sectors.  NBC  continues  to  strengthen  the  supervisory  and \nregulatory framework as it strives to maintain its primary objective of ensuring a safe, sound, \nand stable financial system. Specialized technical support is an ongoing requirement as the \nfinancial sector takes on new products, services, and adopts new international standards and \npractices.  Regulatory  standards  have  been  gradually  improved  and  relevant  prudential \nregulations added since the establishment of the Bank Supervision Department under FSP I. All \nbanks adopted a uniform chart of accounts in 2004 and commenced publishing their annual \naudited financial reports since 2005. An early warning system (Cambodia Off-Site Bank Report \nfor Prompt Corrective Action) was introduced in 2007. Additional regulations were added in \n2008 and early 2009 to (i) promote the proper identification of NPLs; (ii) allocate sufficient \nprovisions for NPLs, internal governance, and fit and proper tests relating to the competencies \nof bank management and board members; and (iii) combat money laundering and financing of \nterrorism. NBC has requested external auditors of each bank to undertake, in addition to the \nannual external audits, a comprehensive review of loan portfolios to June 2008 and provide their \nopinions on the quality of those portfolios and the application of prudential regulations by the \nend  of  September.  These  developments  are  evidence  that  NBC  is  serious  about  bank \nsoundness and has made significant progress to promote market transparency and establish a \nsound  regulatory  and  supervisory  regime  to  enhance  the  integrity  of  the  banking  system. \nAlthough enforcement of prudential regulations is improving, compliance with those regulations \nremains uneven. In June 2009, the Bank Supervision Department had 61 staff with a minimum \nqualification of a bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting, commerce, economics, or law\u201425 have been \nassigned to bank off-site and 15 to bank on-site supervision. NBC intends to increase the \nnumber of supervision staff and enforce compliance during FSP II implementation with TA from \nADB and the IMF.  \n \nC.  Lessons \n25.  Key lessons from the FSP I, subprograms 1 and 2 of the FSP II, and the associated TA \nprojects to the sector include the following: \n \n ", "14   \n \n \n(i)  Long-term perspective. Adoption of the medium-term blueprint for the financial \nsector meant that the Government had a set of long-term objectives to guide and \nshape  medium-term  policy  design  and  implementation.  Changes  in  the \nunderlying  policy  environment  necessitated  an  update  of  the  blueprint.  In \nFebruary 2007, the updated blueprint, known as the FSDS for 2006\u20132015, was \nadopted. The close consultative process involving the Government, ADB, and \nother  development  partners  strengthened  the  Government\u2019s  ownership  and \nincreased the potential for funding agency buy-in.  \n(ii)  Flexibility in design. Financial sector reforms are complex and involve major \nchanges  to  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  institutional  arrangements, \nfinancial  infrastructure,  and  human  capacity.  Hence,  sufficient  time  must  be \nallocated  to  program  implementation.  Design  flexibility  is  also  a  key \nconsideration. The use of the program cluster approach under the FSP I provided \nthe opportunity to refine the proposed policy actions for succeeding subprograms \nto reflect the Government\u2019s achievements, changes in the policy environment, \nand lessons from the previous subprograms. The FSP II has also adopted the \ncluster approach, with each of the four subprograms to be processed annually. \nThis provides the flexibility to address new macroeconomic developments and \nemerging risks to the financial sector.  \n(iii)  Time lag between adoption of reforms and effective enforcement. The 2009 \nindependent program performance evaluation review covering the FSP I noted \nthe time lag between the implementation of reforms and actual enforcement or \ncomprehensive compliance. The delays in enforcement of commercial laws and \ncomprehensive  application  of  compulsory  insurance,  the  credit  information \nsystem,  interbank  market,  and  accounting  and  auditing  standards  were \nspecifically mentioned as these could weaken the effectiveness of the overall \nFSP I program. The enforcement of commercial laws, however, relates to the \ndevelopment of the judicial system as a whole and involves projects funded and \nimplemented by other multilateral and bilateral development partners. The design \nof  the  FSP  II  has  taken  into  account  the  progressive  enforcement  of  the \nremaining reforms toward wider compliance within the sector and has identified a \nprogram of TA projects to support their implementation.  \n(iv)  TA resources. Under the FSP I, the Government adopted legal, policy, and \ninstitutional measures, many of which were relatively new concepts and therefore \nrequired  extensive  coordination  and  consultation  to  ascertain  stakeholders\u2019 \nunderstanding, acceptance, and adoption of the new measures. Substantial TA \nsupport was necessary to ensure that best practices were incorporated and then \nconsolidated throughout implementation to achieve the intended results. The \nFSP  II  has  also  identified  a  program  of  TA  projects  to  help  implement  the \nmedium-term  program  and  enhance  compliance  with  completed  activities. \nIndividual consultants have been selected not only on merit but also on their \nperceived ability to work well with local counterpart staff and sensitivity to the \nlocal culture. These criteria are considered essential for successful transfer of \nknowledge. \n(v)  Emerging  risks.  The  transition  from  a  centrally  controlled  to  a  market-led \neconomy creates new forms of risk. The presence of international banks, the \noffer of more sophisticated services to depositors (credit and debit cards for \nautomatic  teller  machines  and  electronic  funds  transfer  systems),  and  the \nincrease in lending demonstrate increasing investor confidence in Cambodia\u2019s \nfinancial system. With these encouraging developments, however, come new \nrisks and challenges\u2014such as lack of discipline over the use of credit cards, lax ", "      15   \n \napplication  of  credit  underwriting  and  portfolio  management  policies,  and \ninappropriate safety nets for users of electronic cards. Strengthening awareness \nof potential risks within both the public and the financial sectors is therefore \nimportant. Similarly, new ways of mitigating risks must be pursued.  \n   \nVI.  THE PROPOSED SUBPROGRAM \n26.  Links between subprograms. Following approval of the FSP II cluster in December \n2007,  the  momentum  of  implementing  the  policy  reforms  within  the  FSP  II  medium-term \nframework has been maintained. As a continuation of reforms initiated under subprograms 1 \nand  2,  subprogram  3  has  11  key  reform  actions  (triggers)  that  the  Government  began \nimplementing  in  January  2009.  All  have  been  completed  prior  to  Board  circulation. \nDisbursement will follow loan effectiveness. Subprogram 4 has been designed with nine triggers \nand six milestones to continue the policy reforms initiated under subprograms 1, 2, and 3 within \nthe  four  broad  objectives  of  the  medium-term  framework  that  are  intended  to  (i)  improve \nconfidence  and  financial  intermediation,  (ii)  maintain  financial  stability,  (iii)  promote  good \ngovernance,  and  (iv)  enhance  the  efficiency  of  the  financial  sector.  Implementation  of \nsubprogram 4 will commence in January 2010 and will be processed for Board approval and \ndisbursement  in  December  2010.  Reform  measures  may  be  added  to  subprogram  4  as \nnecessary within the medium-term framework after duly considering the Government\u2019s social \nand economic achievements and changes in the macro policy environment.   \n \n27.  Refined subprogram 3 policy triggers. With changing domestic circumstances and \ndevelopmental  priorities,  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  requested  minor \nmodifications to three of the triggers. These minor changes are within the medium-term program \nframework and were endorsed by ADB Management (Table 3).  \n \nTable 3: Refined Subprogram 3 Triggers \nOriginal Trigger  Revised Trigger  Reasons for the Proposed Change \ni.

Progress in the Implementation of Policy Actions under Subprograms 1, 2, and 3 \n1.  Improve Confidence and Financial Intermediation \na.  1.1: Improve Financial Services and the Payments, Clearance, and     \nSettlement System \n28.  A  modernized  payment,  clearance,  and  settlement  system  (PCSS)  is  necessary  to \nimprove and expand service outreach, develop money and interbank markets, and support \nmacroeconomic  policy  implementation.  The  vast  majority  of  transactions  in  Cambodia  are \nconducted in cash rather than by check, and cash transactions are mainly in US dollars. Checks \nare mainly used by companies and a few individuals who maintain bank accounts and are \nmanually  cleared  and  settled  through  clearinghouses  operated  by  NBC  (in  Phnom  Penh, \nSiem Reap, and Sihanoukville, with no electronic link between them). Checks are presented \neach morning at 9:30 a.m. and dishonored checks flow back through the system at 3:00 p.m. \nSettlement from clearing operations is recorded in the NBC books at each branch office. In view \nof the archaic and inefficient way that the current manual system operates, NBC places high \npriority on upgrading the payment and settlement system because it will help build confidence, \nenhance growth in financial intermediation and outreach, and encourage product and service \ninnovation. Further, the rapidly growing economy is straining the current manual system; an \nupgraded system is required to support the larger, more complex financial transactions in the \neconomy; and moving from the cash-based to a check-based treasury accounts system would \nenhance public financial management capacities throughout government.  \n \n29.  In  2005,  Cambodia  enacted  the  Law  on  Negotiable  Instruments  and  Payment \nTransactions, which provides a legal basis for negotiable instruments such as checks, bills of \nexchange,  and  promissory  notes,  plus  regulation  of  payment  systems.  The  process  for \nmodernizing the national PCSS started in 2006 when NBC established the Payments Policy \nUnit (PPU). With technical support from ADB, NBC developed a road map for modernizing the \nnational  PCSS.  Staff  of  the  PPU  consulted  with  banks  to  obtain  their  input  on  the  unit\u2019s \ninitiatives and to garner support for implementing the proposed road map. Under subprogram 1, \nNBC signed a memorandum of understanding with each commercial bank endorsing the road \nmap to modernize the national PCSS. NBC implemented key actions of phase I of the road map \nto  modernize  the  national  PCSS  under  subprogram  2  in  2008.  A  prakas  on  check \nstandardization was issued by NBC in September 2008 after it was reviewed by all banks. An \ninterbank switch was launched in August 2008 between four banks and the shared visa switch \nwas considered a positive beginning and may develop into a more inclusive and beneficial \nsystem in the future. \n \n30.  With a long-term payment expert funded by ADB, the road map to modernize the PCSS \nwas updated and adopted under subprogram 3. In addition, NBC has submitted a proposal to \nMEF for funds (about $3.6 million) under FSP II loan proceeds to upgrade the PCSS. An interim \nsoftware  solution  for  check  clearance  was developed  by  the  NBC  IT  Division.  Following \npreliminary tests with banks, the software went live in May 2009, accompanied by a set of rules \nand procedures to regulate clearance and settlement of checks. Since Cambodia presently \noperates a decentralized system, with every bank maintaining both riel and US dollar settlement \naccounts at each provincial NBC, this interim solution is considered pragmatic. The PPU staff \nwill continue discussions with commercial banks on ways to improve the efficiency of check \nclearance and settlement, on issues regarding retail mobile phone payments, on an interbank \nswitch to handle retail electronic payments, and to identify practical solutions to enhance funds \ntransfer and faster bank settlement during subprogram 4. To enhance funds transfer and early ", "      17   \n \nsettlement,  the  PPU  is  developing  a  credit  remittance  payment  instrument  designed  with \nsuitable flexibility to be used as a direct funds transfer instrument; as a direct credit; and as a \ndirect debit instrument for government salary payment, utility payments, and settlement between \nbanks. The project preparatory TA consultants\u2019 advice on the importance of establishing a real-\ntime gross settlement (RTGS) system has been deferred because a core requirement of any \nRTGS is that bank settlement accounts are centralized so that the central RTGS has a total \nview, and total management, of the respective commercial bank\u2019s credit and liquidity exposure \non a real-time basis. Centralization of commercial bank settlement accounts is being planned for \nimplementation when the new core banking system is successfully implemented and rolled out \nto all branches near the end of 2010.  \n \nb.  1.2: Enhance Consumer Access to Credit and Market Confidence \n31.  To improve the quality of credit underwriting and portfolio management, and to boost \nconfidence  in  the  banking  system,  a  credible  credit  information  system  and  supporting \nregulations are needed. With close cooperation between NBC and the Bankers Association, a \npilot online credit information sharing system (CIS), using negative data, was established in \nAugust 2006 to support the credit appraisal processes of participating banks. Rules, regulations, \nprocedures,  and  a  governing  structure  are  in  place,  but  implementation  has  not  met \nexpectations. Participating banks have reported that since introduction of the CIS they have had \ndifficulty uploading data and accessing the information online. A number of actions have been \ntaken under the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Program9 to improve the software \nsystem and build steering committee capacity to understand how the system operates. Several \nadditions have been made to the system to allow \u201cno cases to report\u201d as a quick option for \nparticipating  banks,  which  can  then  trigger  a  more  focused  follow-up  by  the  CIS  steering \ncommittee.  Subprogram  1  helped  familiarize  stakeholders  with  the  system  and  addressed \nimportant changes to the CIS and its management structure to enhance effectiveness. During \nsubprogram 2, NBC continued to help resolve systematic issues related to the CIS and at the \nsame time strengthen bank compliance which is a key factor in the effectiveness of the CIS. \nUnder subprogram 3, NBC added MFIs into the negative CIS system and plans to upgrade the \nsoftware to include other sources of credit data and explore the possibility of corporatizing the \nCIS during subprogram 4.  \n \n32.  The orderly development and expansion of the financial market requires knowledgeable \ncustomers as well as competent providers of financial services. It requires customers to be able \nto make informed decisions about the services they require and the type of financial institutions \nbest suited to oversee their financial transactions. Since 2005, all banks have been required to \npublish their audited financial statements to enable the public to make informed judgments \nregarding where to place their deposits and with which banks to transact. Several banks have \npublished these annual audited financial reports on their own websites. Following recent high \ncredit  growth  in  the  banking  system,  NBC  requested  all  bank  auditors  to  undertake  a \ncomprehensive portfolio review as of the end of December 2007 and June 2008. These audit \nreports  were  completed  by  the  end  of  June  and  September  2008.  Subprograms  2  and 3 \nsupported NBC in its efforts to promote bank transparency by requiring all audited financial \nstatements of banks as well as new prudential regulations to be published on the NBC website.   \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2004.

Manila (Loan 2129-CAM). \n ", "18   \n \n \nc.  1.3: Develop Interbank Market and Tradable Government Securities \n33.  The  Law  on  Government  Securities  was enacted  in  January  2007  and  provides  a \nframework for the efficient issuance and management of government securities. This market will \nin turn ensure that the Government\u2019s financing requirements and payment obligations are met at \nthe lowest possible cost, and it will provide key information to financial sector participants \nthrough the development of a yield curve. NBC has been assigned the role of maintaining the \nregistry  for  the  issuance  of  government  securities.  Once  the  registry  was \nestablished, with TA under  subprogram  2,  NBC  was  able  to  train  the  relevant  staff  in  the \nfunctions and operation of the registry. NBC and MEF jointly discussed ways to develop a short-\nterm money market during subprogram 3. As an initial step and for liquidity support, NBC is \ndeveloping  regulations  covering  an  interbank  repurchase  master  agreement  that  will  use \ngovernment  securities,  to  be  issued  to  all  commercial  banks  for  implementation  during \nsubprogram 4.  \n \nd.  1.4: Promote Outreach in the Formal Sector  \n34.  Banking activities in rural areas, although not fully developed, are improving\u2014with MFIs \nproviding most of the formal financial services. The formal microfinance industry has undergone \na transition from the development model to a fully commercial model, although some funding is \nstill channeled from aid organizations and their affiliates. Nevertheless, by some estimates, the \ninformal sector still has a greater share by value and number of transactions undertaken within \nthe economy (especially among the poor and remote rural population) than the formal sector, \nwhich  comprises  registered  banks  and  both  licensed  and  registered  MFIs.  To  help  obtain \nreliable data on the actual size and scale of the informal financial sector and an understanding \nof the size and depth of the informal sector outside of the formal financial sector, a national \nsurvey was jointly undertaken by NBC and MEF during subprogram 2. The survey, which \nconcluded in October 2008, provided useful information on nonlicensed MFIs and moneylenders \noutside the formal sector and their impact on the economy. It concluded that, while the informal \nsector  was  much  smaller  in  aggregate  size  than  the  formal  sector,  the  informal  financial \ninstitutions have the advantage of engaging in small-scale financial transactions on account of \nlower  transaction  costs  and  effective  recovery.  The  survey  results  have  helped  MEF  in \nformulating policies to encourage growth in MFI services and products while NBC improves \npolicies covering licensing and supervision.  \n \n35.  The microfinance industry is growing rapidly, with assets expanding at more than 75% \nover the last 3 years. Rapid expansion of assets has put pressure on the source of funding for \nMFIs, as most of their capital and debts are generated from overseas sources. A recent review \nundertaken by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor also identified that the development of \ndeposit services by MFIs has lagged behind credit services and with declining liquidity from \ninternational sources caused by the global financial crisis, NBC has decided to make domestic \nfinance  more  accessible  to MFIs  during  subprogram  3.  Firstly,  a  regulation  was  adopted \ncovering the minimum financial, institutional, and managerial requirements for MFIs wishing to \ncollect,  and  intermediate,  voluntary  public  deposits.  The  regulation  has,  among  others, \nincreased the minimum capital requirement from $62,000 to $2.5 million. Two qualified MFIs \nhave been granted licenses and two applications are being processed. MFIs without this license \ncan only raise compulsory deposits from members up to 5% of total loans. NBC has also \nencouraged  individual  commercial  banks  to  lend  directly  to  MFIs  and  five  banks  have \ncommenced lending (one in local currency and the other four in US dollars) to MFIs since early \n2009. NBC will continue to enhance growth in the number of deposit taking MFIs and encourage \nmore commercial banks to lend in riels to MFIs during subprogram 4. ", "      19   \n \n \n2.  Maintain Stability in the Financial Sector \na.  2.1: Update the Legal and Regulatory Framework for Banks \n36.  As part of Cambodia\u2019s efforts to strengthen prudential supervision, update regulations, \nand ensure stability, NBC issued regulations (i) on large exposures of banks and financial \ninstitutions, and (ii) to amend the prakas on licensing of commercial and specialized banks \nunder  subprogram  1.  Under  subprogram  2,  NBC  continued  to  review  and  update  existing \nregulations  and  introduced  new  prudential  regulations  to  ensure  banks  comply  with  the \napplicable Basel 1 core principles for effective bank supervision. Under subprogram 3, NBC has \nissued regulations on (i) corporate governance for banks and financial institutions, (ii) updated \nasset classification and provisioning for banks and financial institutions, and (iii) commenced \nwork on the internal control regulation that will include conflict of interest rules for banks and \nfinancial  institutions.  Further,  because  the  Law  on  Banking  and  Financial  Institutions  was \nenacted in 1999, a comprehensive review of this law is needed to effectively address the \nfeatures of a changing domestic market and the reality of increasing international economic \nintegration.  The  review,  with  TA  from  ADB  (footnote  8)  under  subprogram  2,  took  into \nconsideration consumer protection in connection with the use of debit and credit cards, bank \nsecrecy provisions to support development of the CIS, procedures for administering distressed \nand insolvent banks, and protection or immunity of bank regulators. Based on the findings of \nthis  review,  a  revised  and  updated  law  was  submitted  to  the  Council  of  Ministers  during \nsubprogram 3 and then to the National Assembly during subprogram 4.  \n \nb.  2.2: Strengthen Bank Supervision Capacity and Adopt Measures to \nSustain Financial Stability \n37.  Updating and upgrading skills is a priority area that must be an ongoing feature of \ndevelopment and the deepening of the financial system. New risks will emerge, requiring that \nskills  development  and  training  be  pursued  in  tandem  with  these  developments.  NBC  will \ncontinue to strengthen and upgrade the capacity of its own supervision staff to be able to \nmanage these developments effectively. At the same time, NBC recognizes that the financial \nsector  is  still  in  an  early  stage  of  development  and  thus  will  strengthen  its  surveillance \nmechanisms.  The  IMF  has  been  providing  a  resident  adviser  to  help  develop  the  off-site \ncapability of the bank supervision staff and will continue to provide support until 2010. With TA \nof $1.7 million (footnote 8) that was approved together with subprogram 1, ADB has been \nproviding technical support to help improve bank on-site examination procedures and skills of \nthe  NBC  staff  concerned.  During  subprogram  2,  NBC  evaluated  staff  capacity  for  bank \nsupervision and underscored the need for extended ADB support for bank on-site supervision. \nThis is very important in view of the rapid increase in the number and size of loans, and concern \nwith the quality of information reported by these banks. To continue supporting NBC\u2019s work in \nthis very important area, ADB approved TA10 together with subprogram 2 in 2008 that provided \non-the-job guidance to bank on-site supervision teams to undertake a detailed review of the six \nlargest commercial banks during subprogram 3. The results of the on-site inspections have \nbeen very useful in recent analysis of the impact of the global economic crisis on Cambodia\u2019s \nbanking system and have provided important data to the off-site supervision team for follow-up.  \n \n                                                 \n10 Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Implementation of Key Policy Triggers of Subprogram 3 \n(TA 7185-CAM) attached to ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on \na Proposed Loan for Subprogram 2 to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Financial Sector Program II Cluster. \nManila (Loan 2479-CAM). \n ", "20   \n \n \n38.  NBC has formulated remedial measures, broadly anchored on the policy matrix and \nprogram policy framework, covering stronger sanctions to address potential vulnerabilities in the \nbanking  system.  NBC  will  closely  monitor  progress  with  implementation  of  the  remedial \nmeasures, and ADB will regularly review progress reports. Under subprogram 1, NBC has \n(i) assessed  and  identified  capacity  building  needs  for  banking  supervision,  and \n(ii) strengthened surveillance and undertaken prompt corrective measures for banks that are not \nconforming to the laws and prudential regulations. NBC continues to require nonconforming \nbanks to provide progress reports and promptly undertake corrective measures, and these \nreports have been discussed with ADB missions. Further, NBC has reviewed its regulations to \nstrengthen good corporate governance, including the requirement for fit and proper testing of \nkey  bank management  positions  in  terms  of technical  qualifications  and  experience  under \nsubprogram 2. The regulation on corporate governance, including the requirements for fit and \nproper  test  of  key  bank  management  personnel,  was  formally  issued  as  a  prakas  in \nOctober 2008. NBC continues to monitor the implementation of the above regulations as well as \nthe prompt corrective measures that need to be taken following an on-site inspection. NBC has \nassessed the feasibility of introducing rating agencies for the major banks under subprogram 3, \nand  concluded  that  it  is  too  early  to  introduce  rating  agencies  as  there  are  a  number  of \nprudential and disclosure standards yet to be adopted and implemented.  \n \n39.  As a reflection of rapid economic growth up to 2007, domestic liquidity has been rising \nrapidly, from a very small base, partly fueled by the surge in capital inflows from foreign direct \ninvestments and by the rapid growth of credit to the private sector. The inflation rate, sparked by \nsupply-side shocks, surged from an annual rate of 10.8% in December 2007 to 25.1% in June \n2008. To mop up excess liquidity and avoid an inflationary spiral, NBC doubled the minimum \nreserve requirement from 8% to 16% in July 2008, and favorably considered applications from \ncommercial banks to place excess reserves abroad with prudentially approved counterparties \nduring subprogram 2. Prior to introducing the above measures, NBC consulted the IMF in March \n2008 and the Bankers Association in April 2008, neither of which had any objection to the \nmeasures. The above measures helped return bank lending growth to sustainable levels. With \nfood and fuel prices coming down in the later part of 2008, combined with the above policy \nmeasures, the inflation rate has been reduced to single digit in early 2009. Since the beginning \nof 2009, NBC has taken substantive actions in response to emerging challenges on the banking \nsystem from the indirect effects of the global economic slowdown. They include the easing of \nmonetary policy by reducing the minimum reserve requirement from 16% to 12%, availing of an \noverdraft facility for individual banks to meet temporary liquidity needs, and encouraging the \nBankers Association to support the development of an interbank market under subprogram 3. \nNBC will continue to provide periodic macroeconomic and financial data for ADB to monitor the \nperformance of the financial sector during subprogram 4.  \n \nc.  2.3: Strengthen Prudential Supervision and Regulations for \nMicrofinance Institutions \n40.  Appropriate financial regulation and supervision are essential to build resilience against \nfinancial crisis. Similarly, providing incentives and guidance to financial institutions could further \nenhance their operations. NBC made significant progress in building the regulatory framework \nfor licensing and supervising registered MFIs. It established a division for prudential supervision \nof MFIs within the Banking Supervision Department and issued several prudential regulations in \nthe form of prakas. Division staff has had some training through technical support11 from ADB to \n                                                 \n11 Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Financial Sector Program Implementation (TA 4656-CAM) \nattached to ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed ", "      21   \n \nundertake off-site and, to a limited extent, on-site supervision. Under subprogram 1, NBC has \nissued  regulations  to  amend  the  prakas  on  the  licensing  of  microfinance  institutions.  The \naccompanying  TA  (footnote  8)  for  subprogram  1  also  provided  technical  support  to  help \nstrengthen NBC\u2019s supervision of MFIs. NBC issued additional regulations covering MFIs that \ncan mobilize voluntary savings (December 2007) and management of foreign exchange risks \n(early 2008). The accompanying TA for subprogram 2 (footnote 10) continued ADB\u2019s support to \nstrengthen off-site and on-site supervision of the growing MFI subsector. With the growing \nnumber  and  overall  size  of  activities  generated  by  registered  money  changers,  NBC  is \ndeveloping a code of conduct for adoption during subprogram 3 and to be implemented during \nsubprogram 4.  \n    \nd.  2.4: Enhance Legal Foundation to Support Financial and \nCommercial Transactions \n41.  For financial transactions to develop beyond basic, short-term, and mainly cash-based \ntransactions, a legal framework for commerce and finance must be developed, updated, and \nimplemented.  Progress  in  preparing  and  enacting  a  number  of  components  of  the  legal \nframework for financial and commercial transactions has been significant. This includes laws \non insurance,  accounting  and  auditing,  commercial  enterprises,  negotiable  instruments  and \npayment transactions, commercial arbitration, secured transactions, nongovernment securities, \ncombating money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and insolvency. Under subprogram \n1,  MEF successfully  facilitated  the  adoption  of  the  Law  on  Government  Securities by  the \nNational Assembly in September 2007. Most of the enacted laws have been implemented, and \ntraining curricula have been introduced at selected legal faculties to train legal practitioners and \njudges on these new principles. The Ministry of Commerce (MOC) continues to promote public \nawareness of new commercial laws at the provincial level and has been monitoring the progress \nof training provided by selected legal faculties for judges, lawyers, and legal clerks during \nsubprogram 3.  \n \n42.  Laws that were recently enacted require the adoption of implementing sub-decrees. The \nGovernment has developed the sub-decree for the secured transactions law. ADB has also \nprovided technical support to assist MOC with the drafting of a new law on commercial contracts \nunder subprogram 2. The new law would supplement the Civil Code provisions, include general \nprovisions relating to agencies and franchising, and increase public confidence in the use of \nwritten  commercial  contracts  in  Cambodia  for  a  variety  of  business  transactions.  ADB  TA \n(footnote  8)  continued  supporting  the  Government  in  its  efforts  to  review  Cambodia\u2019s \nrequirements  for  a  detailed  set  of  rules  for  commercial  transactions,  review  relevant \ninternational models and approaches, and draft a new harmonized law on commercial contracts \nfor submission to the Council of Ministers during subprogram 3. Submission of the draft law to \nthe National Assembly is expected during subprogram 4.  \n \n3.  Promote Good Governance \na.  3.1: Promote International Initiatives on Combating Money \nLaundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n43.  Work toward combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism in Cambodia is \nsupporting international deterrence efforts and standard governance principles. This will help \n                                                                                                                                                          \nLoan and Technical Assistance Grant to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Subprogram III of the Financial Sector \nProgram. Manila (Loan 2185-CAM). \n ", "22   \n \n \nbuild market confidence and discipline. Throughout 2005 and 2006, NBC and the Australian \nTransaction Reports and Analysis Centre conducted joint training workshops on combating \nmoney laundering and the financing of terrorism in general, including procedures to assess \nsuspicious transactions reports and the roles of compliance officers at banks and financial \ninstitutions. They also conducted an assessment on combating money laundering and the \nfinancing of terrorism. Subprogram 1 supported the Government in its successful efforts to \nadopt the Law on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism in 2007. This \nwas followed by adoption of sub-decrees covering the appointment of the board of directors, the \nsecretary general to head the Cambodian Financial Intelligence Unit (CAFIU), and the authority \nto  establish  the  CAFIU  during  subprogram  2.  NBC  formally  established  the  Cambodian \nFinancial  Intelligence  Unit  (CAFIU)  with  five  staff  and  adequate  budget  allocation  during \nsubprogram 3. ADB, Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering, the Australian Transaction \nReports  and  Analysis  Centre,  the  Bank  Negara  Malaysia,  the  World  Bank,    and  other \ndevelopment partners continue to provide TA that has helped CAFIU prepare the following \nregulations: (i) internal rules and code of conduct for CAFIU; (ii) CAFIU\u2019s business plan for \n2009\u20132011; (iii) strategy and implementation plan for initiatives on combating money laundering \nand the financing of terrorism; and (iv) sub-decree on combating money laundering and the \nfinancing of terrorism, covering all other reporting entities not regulated by NBC. NBC will assist \nin adopting the above regulations to help enhance the role of the CAFIU and coordination \namong supervisory authorities during subprogram 4. \n \nb.  3.2: Enhance Corporate Governance and Transparency in the \nInsurance Industry \n44.  Building  consumer  confidence  in  insurance  as  a  service  will  first  require  public \nunderstanding of the insurance business and the services it can provide. Business must be \nconducted  as  transparently  as  possible  to  protect  consumers  and  ensure  that  information \nprovided to the public and the regulator is accurate. The goal for all participants in the industry is \nto  raise  their  operations  to  international  standards,  which  the  reinsurer  and  regulator  are \nresponsible for reinforcing. The Government and the insurance association can contribute to the \ninsurance  industry\u2019s  development  by  increasing  public  awareness  about  how  the  industry \noperates. The regulator can take a leadership role by ensuring transparency within the industry, \nas well as among the public and other government ministries. Under subprogram 1, MEF issued \nregulations on (i) premium rates for fire insurance, and (ii) licensing of general and life insurance \ncompanies. MEF also issued prakas covering corporate governance and solvency for insurance \ncompanies  in  early  2008.  A  prakas  on  accounting  guidelines  for  general  insurance  was \ndiscussed  with  international  accounting  firms,  the  National  Accounting  Council,  and  the \ninsurance firms, and this has been adopted under subprogram 2. With technical support from \nADB, MEF worked closely with the association of insurance companies to ensure smooth \nimplementation of the reporting standards, and revised the insurance law for submission to the \nCouncil of Ministers during subprogram 3. MEF will assist with the clearance of the revised law \nby the Council of Ministers, following which it will be submitted to the National Assembly. MEF \nwill also require the publication of audited financial statements of insurance companies during \nsubprogram 4. \n \nc.  3.3: Establish Commercial Dispute Resolution Mechanism \n45.  To promote good governance and boost public confidence in the financial system, the \nGovernment enacted the law on commercial arbitration in 2006. The draft sub-decree is being \nreviewed by the Council of Ministers and once adopted, a national arbitration center (NAC) will \nbe  established.  The  arbitration  center  will  improve  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the ", "      23   \n \ncommercial and financial systems, as well as provide the commercial community with a cost-\neffective non-judicial process for dispute resolution. With greater public awareness of the NAC\u2019s \nfunctioning, confidence in the financial sector should increase. Before the center can commence \noperation, however, members of the judiciary, legal profession, and management personnel will \nneed to be trained. The TA under subprogram 2 supported MOC\u2019s efforts to establish a national \narbitration center by developing and adopting the implementing sub-decree for commercial \narbitration. ADB TA support continued to help MOC in selecting and training the founding \nmembers,  establishing  the  Board  and  Management  structure,  formulating  the  rules  and \nadministrative procedures, and adopting a code of conduct and operating budget for the NAC \nduring subprogram 3. MOC will continue to provide the necessary support during subprogram 4 \nto ensure the NAC functions effectively, and will also ensure that programs to promote public \nawareness of NAC\u2019s roles and responsibilities are implemented. \n \nd.  3.4: Strengthen the Accounting Institutions and Professional \nCapacity of Members \n46.  For  efficient  financial  intermediation,  financial  market  infrastructure  needs  to  be \ndeveloped\u2014particularly accounting and auditing systems, with qualified personnel to implement \nthem. In 2005, only 10 locally qualified accountants were working in Cambodia. In a move to \nstrengthen and increase accounting and auditing capacity and standards, MEF introduced a \ngovernment-funded scholarship scheme to assist at least 70 recipients annually to acquire the \nqualification  needed  to  become  members  of  the  Kampuchea  Institute  of  Certified  Public \nAccountants  and  Auditors.  These  scholarships  were  initially  awarded  to  government  civil \nservants only, but poor performance and a high dropout rate in the initial phase caused ADB to \npersuade the Government to open the scholarships to the public in the second half of 2006, with \nselection strictly on merit. Results have greatly improved since then, and MEF continued to \nsupport this public scholarship scheme under subprograms 2 and 3. The last batch of 70 CPA \nscholarship awardees was recruited in 2009, so there will be sufficient program funds to ensure \nthat  current  awardees  successfully  complete  the  CPA  program.  MEF  will  introduce \n35 scholarships for the 2-year certified accounting technician program during subprogram 4. \n \n4.  Enhance Efficiency in the Financial Sector \na.  4.1: Computerize and Integrate Key Operating Functions of NBC  \n47.  NBC\u2019s current IT system is not well integrated across the bank, resulting in duplication \nand inefficiency. NBC would gain considerable benefits in terms of its ability to provide a more \nefficient service to the banking sector by implementing an integrated system that initially links \nthe accounting department to the cash management functions in the issues department, the \ncustomer  account  management  in  the  banking  operations  department,  and  the  foreign \nexchange transactions in the exchange management department. Under subprogram 1, NBC \nreviewed and adopted the information technology architecture model for a total estimated cost \nof $4.0 million. MEF has allocated a $4.0 million grant to NBC to finance the new system, \nincluding the required hardware, and ADB provided two international consultants to assist NBC \nin procuring, designing, and installing the system. Under subprogram 2, NBC reviewed its \nmanagement information system and commenced the procurement process to acquire the \nsoftware and hardware for an integrated accounting system. The procurement process using \ninternational  bidding  was  concluded  in  February  2009  following  the  successful  conclusion \nof contract negotiations.  \n \n ", "24   \n \n \n48.  Implementation under subprogram 3 commenced with a kick-off meeting on 23 March \n2009 for NBC, the representatives of the three contracted suppliers, and the IT consultants to \nfinalize the implementation schedule. Installation of the hardware commenced in late April 2009 \nfollowed by the core software system upon completion of the gap analysis, product walkthrough, \nand the initial functional and technical training. Final testing of the hardware and sign-off was \ncompleted in July 2009. The operating system, Oracle software, and database were installed \nand signed off for acceptance in July 2009. The product walkthrough and functional training \nhave been completed. The go-live target has been set for February 2010, followed by branch \nrollout during subprogram 4. Expected benefits from an integrated accounting system include \nimproved application software for other parts of the bank, in particular departments that do not \nneed to link to the core banking system in real time, such as banking supervision, personnel, \nand economic research and statistics. Eventually, the system should also link the accounting \ndepartment to the NBC branches, thus promoting financial deepening and operating efficiency. \nWide area network infrastructure will be established at NBC to facilitate real-time clearing and \nsettlement operations.  \n \nb.  4.2: Upgrade the Capacity of Microfinance Institution Staff \n49.  Finding  adequately  trained  and  skilled  people  to  meet  the  needs  of  a  growing \nmicrofinance  industry  is  an  ongoing  challenge.  Growth  puts  pressure  on  the  delivery  and \ncustomer sides of the business. Capacity development structures are needed within MFIs. In \nconsultation with the association of MFIs, the Center for Banking Studies will undertake a review \nof its curriculum with the objective of expanding the scope of training to include all aspects of \nMFI  business  and  to  increase  management  awareness  of  liquidity  risk,  interest  rate  risk, \nconcentration of credit risk, and foreign exchange risk. TA under subprogram 2 has helped \nreview and upgrade the Center for Banking Studies curriculum, and added two specialized \ntraining curricula for MFIs. Under subprogram 3, NBC evaluated the progress on capacity \nbuilding for MFIs, including supervision, and this will determine the nature of additional capacity \nsupport that is required for implementation during subprogram 4.  \n \nB.  Financing Plan \n50.  The Government has requested a loan of $10 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources  for  subprogram  3.  The  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  a  single  tranche  upon \nsatisfactory compliance with specific conditions indicated in the policy matrix. The loan will have \na 24-year term, including an 8-year grace period. The interest rate will be 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The ADB funds are to help defray the costs \nincurred by the Government to implement the reforms outlined in the development policy letter \nof 26 October 2007 and the policy matrix as updated.  \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management  \n51.  NBC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  and  MEF  and  MOC  will  be  the  Implementing \nAgencies for subprogram 3 and the TA. The financial sector steering committee will continue to \ncoordinate program implementation among government ministries, agencies and development \npartners  concerned  (Development  Coordination  Matrix  in  Appendix  4).  To  ensure  timely \nprogram implementation, the committee, comprising senior officers from MEF, MOC, and NBC, \nwill meet as required to review progress reports from the technical working group and consider \npending issues. The committee will propose concrete actions to resolve those issues. A senior ", "      25   \n \nNBC  officer  has  been  appointed  as  program  director  to  assist  MEF,  MOC,  and  NBC  in \ncoordinating  day-to-day  program  implementation.  The  program  director  will  be  required  to \nsubmit quarterly progress reports on subprogram 3 implementation. \n \n2.  Period of Implementation  \n52.  The implementation period for subprogram 3 is from January to December 2009. The \nGovernment  aims  to  complete  implementation  of  all  policy  actions  before  approval  of  the \nsubprogram 3 loan. \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement  \n53.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local \nduties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding a \nnegative  list  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  5)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources. All procurement of goods and services produced in, and originating from, \nADB member countries will be made with due consideration to economy and efficiency, as well \nas in accordance with standard public sector procedures in Cambodia and normal private sector \ncommercial practices acceptable to ADB. In accordance with provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification \nof Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans (1998), the loan \nproceeds will be disbursed to the Government as the Borrower. The Government will certify that \n(i) the value of the country\u2019s eligible imports is equal to, or exceeds, the amount of ADB\u2019s \nprojected disbursements under the loan in a given period; and (ii) the loan proceeds will be \nutilized in a manner satisfactory to ADB. The loan proceeds will be disbursed based on the \ncertification provided by the Government, which confirms that the requirements for the loan \nhave been met. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the \naccuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. Subprogram 3 will provide for retroactive financing for \nexpenditures incurred by the Government up to 180 days prior to loan effectiveness.  \n \n4.  Anticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n54.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and the Policy on Combating \nMoney Laundering (2003) were explained to the Government. All relevant ADB guidelines and \nthe loan regulations were specifically brought to the attention and notice of the Government. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire the Government to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls \nfollowing international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. All contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Program shall \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nthe Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, and service providers as they relate to the \nProgram. \n \n55.  An assessment of the country\u2019s public financial management systems was carried out to \nbetter understand the fiduciary risks and determine appropriate arrangements for the fiduciary \narrangements  of  subprogram  3.  Discussions  were  held  with  the  Government  during \nimplementation of subprogram 3 on the funds flow from NBC to MEF and the contribution of the \n ", "26   \n \n \nongoing public financial management reform program12 to the administration of loan proceeds.13 \nVery satisfactory progress has been noted in revenue collections, with greater use of the \nbanking system to streamline revenue collection and payment processes. The redesign of an \nintegrated chart of accounts and budget classification has been substantially completed to \nimprove  expenditure  tracking  and  reporting. As  part  of efforts  to  improve  governance  and \nreduce corruption, the Government continues to place significant emphasis on strengthening the \noverall  public  financial  management  system,  internal  systems  (including  internal  audit \nfunctions),  and  the  functions  of  the  National  Audit  Authority.  The  ongoing  public  financial \nmanagement program, which started in 2004 and is supported by 10 development partners \nincluding ADB,14 has helped lower the fiduciary risk of the system. \n \n56.  A core component of the FSP II focuses on promoting good governance, deterring \nmoney laundering and financing of terrorism, and implementing measures that will help deter \ncorruption  in  the  overall  economy  (a  good  governance  framework  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A). Subprogram 3 includes measures to improve the management information system \nand reporting standards within NBC, banks, insurance firms, and MFIs; promote transparency of \ninformation released by banks and MFIs; improve compliance with and usefulness of the credit \ninformation sharing system; support implementation of anti-money-laundering regulations; and \ndeter  activities  that  could  support  the  financing  of  terrorism.  Increasing  use  of  payment \ninstruments other than cash will particularly help discourage corruption at central, provincial, \nand district treasuries. These reforms will help keep savers and investors informed, empower \ncivil society to monitor the weaknesses in these financial institutions, and deter those who are \nvulnerable to corrupt activities. \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n57.  The  Government  will  open  or  nominate  an  account  with  NBC  to  receive  the  loan \nproceeds for subprogram 3. It will manage, operate, and liquidate the account in accordance \nwith terms satisfactory to ADB. ADB will retain the right to audit any account and records \nrelating to utilization of the loan proceeds.  \n \n6.  Counterpart Funds \n58.    The Government will use the local currency counterpart funds generated by the loan \nproceeds  to  meet  program  expenditures  and  associated  costs  of  reform  and  additional \nbudgetary allocation to help ease the effects of the global economic downturn. \n \n7.  Program Performance Monitoring and Review \n59.  The program director (para. 51) will coordinate and submit quarterly progress reports on \npolicy and institutional reform implementation to the financial sector steering committee and \nADB. The reports will be submitted in such form and detail as ADB may request, and include \n(i) progress  made  and  problems  encountered  during  the  review  period,  (ii)  steps  taken  or \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2008.

The Government will inform ADB of outcomes of policy discussions with the \nIMF, World Bank Group, and bilateral funding agencies having implications for subprogram 3 \nand TA implementation. \n \n60.  ADB, in cooperation with NBC, MEF, and MOC, will conduct semiannual reviews of \nprogram implementation progress and assess macroeconomic developments and their impacts \non the financial and related sectors of the economy. The Government and ADB will continue to \nengage in active policy dialogue throughout subprogram 3 implementation on macroeconomic \nissues that may affect financial sector development and on additional reforms that may be \nnecessary  or  desirable  for  sustainable  development  of  the  financial  sector.  Not  later  than \n4 months after completion of subprogram 3, the Government will prepare and submit to ADB a \nprogram completion report. \n \nVII.  SUBPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.   Benefits \n61.  With a rapidly growing commercial economy that requires a sound financial system to \nsustain economic growth, the Government needs to develop the financial sector by mobilizing \nfinancial resources, channeling them to productive investments, and managing inherent risks if it \nis to achieve long-term sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. The Asian financial \ncrisis  of  1997  and  the  2008  global  financial  crisis  have  provided  many  examples  of  the \ndevastating impact that financial crises can have on countries, wiping out several years of \ngrowth within a very short time. Thus, to promote economic growth, reduce poverty, and help \nCambodia avoid financial crises, subprogram 3 of the FSP II will support the Government in its \ndevelopment agenda. \n \n62.  The policies supported by subprogram 3 of the FSP II will help reduce information \nasymmetry,  improve  governance,  enhance  financial  stability,  and  improve  efficiency  in  the \nfinancial sector. These factors will contribute to a more conducive environment for continued \nfinancial market development. Subprogram 3 of the FSP II is expected to help boost confidence \namong market participants and, with improvements to the payments, clearance, and settlement \nsystem, financial intermediation will grow. That will result in a wider offering of products and \nservices in urban and rural areas. A sound, more efficient, and diversified financial sector will \nsupport  higher  investments  and  productivity  in  the  private  sector.  Together  with  broader \neconomic reforms, reforms in the financial sector will contribute to higher economic growth. \n \nB.        Social and Environmental Safeguards \n63.  Subprogram  3  of  the  FSP  II  will  not  entail  any  involuntary  resettlement  or  have  a \nnegative  impact  on  indigenous  people  or  the  environment.  It  is  classified  category  C  for \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  impact  on  indigenous  people,  and  impact  on  the  environment. \nSubprogram 3 of the FSP II is a general intervention aimed at supporting sustainable economic \ngrowth. In that respect, it is expected to have an indirect positive effect on poverty reduction. A \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 6. \n \nC.    Assumptions and Risks \n64.  Subprogram 3 of the FSP II  assumes political stability in Cambodia and sustained \nimplementation  of  sound  macroeconomic  policies  by  the  Government.  Given  Cambodia\u2019s \n ", "28   \n \n \nencouraging results in the past decade, both these assumptions are valid and defensible. \nImplementation of subprogram 3 could face a number of risks, however, for which mitigation \nmeasures have been put in place.  \n \n(i)  External challenges to sustaining economic growth. Cambodia\u2019s economic \nprospects must be viewed against a number of adverse developments in the \nexternal environment. The unexpected surge in international energy and food \nprices toward the end of 2007 fueled higher domestic inflation in the early part of \n2008,  with  potential  knock-on  effects  on  consumption,  growth,  and  poverty. \nThrough a combination of fiscal and monetary measures that were introduced by \nthe Government, inflation has been moderated and lending has slowed down \nsince late 2008. Falling energy and commodity prices have helped ease the \ninflation rate to a single digit in early 2009. Conditions changed in the third \nquarter  of  2008  because  of  the  spillover  effects  of  the  financial  crisis  that \noriginated in the US and Europe causing the global economic slowdown. The \neffects of the global economic downturn have negatively affected Cambodia\u2019s \ngrowth  rate  since  the  last  quarter  of  2008,  through  reduced  demand  for \nCambodia\u2019s garments, falling tourist arrivals, and decline in foreign investments \nfor large-scale construction projects. As the garment, tourism, and construction \nindustries are three of the four main drivers of growth, the economy is projected \nto slow down to \u20131.5% (from 2.5%) in 2009 from an estimated 6.7% in 2008. The \nGovernment has further eased monetary policy since February 2009. The fiscal \ndeficit is forecast to be above the 2009 approved budget to create space for \nfiscal stimulus. Because of the uncertainty about the length and depth of impact \nof this global economic downturn, the Government and ADB will continue to \nundertake periodic reviews of macroeconomic and financial developments to \nassess potential risks to the financial sector throughout subprogram 3. These \nreviews  will  continue  through  the  program  period  for  subprogram  4.  Budget \nassistance through other program loans in 2009, including through this program, \nis being provided to bolster the economy\u2019s resilience.  \n \n(ii)    Weak  governance  and  corruption  in  the  sector.  Weak  governance  and \nincidents  of  corruption  could  erode  investor  confidence  and  prevent  the \nattainment of expected sector outcomes. The Government\u2019s National Strategic \nDevelopment Plan 2006\u20132010 views corruption as a threat to sustained growth \nand development of the country in general. Backed by an active development \ncommunity,  the  Government  is  increasingly  taking  a  tougher  stance  against \ncorruption. The consensus is that good governance and measures to address \ncorruption are needed for a successful partnership between the Government and \nthe development community. This was considered during design of the program \ncluster, and there will be continuous pursuit of improvements to the institutional \ngovernance structure, accounting disclosure standards, financial transparency, \ncomplementary  legislation,  regulatory  updates  and  enforcement,  supervision, \nand surveillance of the financial sector.  \n \n(iii)  Weak institutional and human capacity. Some of the financial sector risks are \nassociated with weak institutional and human capacity. The same applies to the \nimplementation and enforcement of new laws  and prudential regulations. To \nmitigate those risks, training programs have been initiated at various training \ninstitutions established during the FSP I. Subprograms 2 and 3 provide financial \nsupport to the institutions to help update their curricula. The proposed capacity ", "      29   \n \ndevelopment TA that is being processed separately will help reduce the risks \narising from weak capacity, especially in the implementation of all prudential \nregulations and in addressing new challenges emerging from the lower domestic \ngrowth caused by the global economic downturn. With these design safeguards, \nthe integrated benefits and impacts are expected to far outweigh any costs.  \n \nVIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n65.  A program of annual TA projects was identified to help implement the FSP II medium-\nterm program. TA for $1.7 million was approved with subprogram 1 (footnote 8) to support NBC, \nMEF, and MOC in implementing the policy and institutional reforms under subprogram 2 and \nsome of the reform triggers and milestones for subprogram 3. A TA (footnote 10) for $300,000 \nwas also approved together with subprogram 2 (i) to further strengthen on-site supervision and \nsurveillance of the banking system, (ii) to help strengthen off-site and on-site supervision of \nMFIs, and (iii) to strengthen the supervision and surveillance of the insurance industry. In \nresponse to the Government\u2019s request, ADB is processing a separate TA project to support \nNBC,  MEF,  and  MOC  in  implementing  key  reform  triggers  for  subprogram  4  and  thereby \ncomplete most of the FSP II outputs initiated under subprograms 1 and 2.  \n \nIX.  ASSURANCES \n66.  In addition to complying with and implementing the actions specified in the subprogram 3 \npolicy  matrix  and  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following  specific \nassurances, which are incorporated in the Loan Agreement: \n \n(i)  The  Government  will  (a)  implement  the  policy  triggers  and  milestones  in \naccordance with the schedule of policy reforms contained in the medium-term \npolicy framework and as described in the development policy letter, and ensure \nsustainability of the reforms beyond the subprogram 3 period; and (b) carry out \nall of its obligations as stipulated under the Loan Agreement in a timely manner.  \n(ii)  The  Government  will  undertake  all  reasonable  measures  to  implement  the \ntriggers (reform actions) set out in the medium-term policy framework, which is \nthe prerequisite for processing subprogram 4. \n(iii)  The Government will keep ADB informed of, and will at least semiannually, and \nmore  frequently  as  requested,  exchange  views  on  the  progress  made  in \nimplementing subprogram 3. Furthermore, the Government will continue timely \npolicy dialogue on this same frequency with ADB on macroeconomic policies and \nconstraints, will keep ADB informed of policy discussions with other multilateral \nand  bilateral  agencies  that  have  implications  for  the  implementation  of \nsubprogram 3 and the overall program cluster, and will provide ADB with an \nopportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals. The Government will \ntake ADB\u2019s views into consideration before finalizing and implementing any such \nproposals. \n \nX.  RECOMMENDATION \n67.

The development path in the 1990s reflected the period of liberal entry of financial \ninstitutions at a time when regulation and supervisory capacity were weak. The era was marked \nby  a  rapid  rise  in  the  number  of  joint  ventures,  locally  incorporated  family-owned  banks, \nbranches of foreign banks, and state-owned financial institutions. This resulted in most financial \ninstitutions  being  poorly  managed  and  almost  half  being  considered  technically  insolvent. \nSupported by an International Monetary Fund poverty reduction and growth facility that was \nphased out in 2003, the banking system relicensing program (i) introduced a legal framework for \nbanks and financial institutions, (ii) successfully closed all nonviable banks, (iii) relicensed the \nremaining  banks  under  strengthened  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  (NBC)  supervision \nrequirements, and (iv) initiated restructuring and privatization of the major state-owned foreign \ntrade  bank.  Cambodia\u2019s  financial  sector  remains  shallow  and  fragile,  with  limited  financial \nintermediation and outreach. \n \n2.  At the end of July 2009, the formal financial system comprised NBC, 27 commercial \nbanks, 6 specialized banks, and 2 representative offices of foreign-based banks; 20 licensed \nand 25 registered microfinance institutions (MFIs); and 7 insurance companies. Cambodia also \nhas  the  objective  of  developing  bond  and  securities  markets  in  the  near  future.  The \npredominantly rural nature of the economy, high transaction costs, and low creditor confidence \nhave been the main factors resulting in low formal intermediation and outreach within the \nfinancial sector. There has also been a slow development of nonbank financial institutions, with \na limited range of products and services being offered. \n \n3.  The Government\u2019s vision for the financial sector is for a sound, market-based system \nthat will enhance resource mobilization, ensure the effective allocation of financial resources, \nand  contribute  to  broad-based  sustainable  economic  growth  as  embodied  in  the  Financial \nSector Development Strategy (FSDS) 2006\u20132015. The FSDS recognizes that, for equitable \ngrowth to occur, a diversified, competitive, but prudentially sound financial system would play an \nimportant  role  in  national  development  by  ensuring  efficient  accumulation  and  effective \nallocation of financial resources. At the same time, expanding finance brings risks. Hence, when \npursuing financial development, a focus on prudential risk management, transparency, and \nuniform application of rules and regulations is needed. \n \n4.  Dominated  by  the  banking  system,  the  financial  sector  has  gone  through  major \nrestructuring and reforms since the mid-1990s. In 1996, NBC was established as the central \nbank following promulgation of the Law on the Organization and Conduct of the National Bank \nof Cambodia. In 1999, the Government enacted the Law on Banking and Financial Institutions, \nenabling NBC to undertake a relicensing program that brought about the closure of 16 nonviable \nbanks in 2002, raised capital requirements for the remaining banks to $13 million equivalent, \nand set the minimum capital adequacy requirement at 20% of risk-weighted assets (which was \nthen appropriately reduced to 15% in 2004). In an effort to further strengthen and consolidate \nthe banking system, NBC issued a directive in September 2008 requiring commercial banks that \nare owned by nonbank entities or individuals to increase their minimum capital to the equivalent \nof $36.5 million by 2010. The Financial Sector Development Blueprint,1 formulated and adopted \nin 2001, provided a clear set of objectives and a sequenced program of reforms in the financial \nsector.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  the  lead  development  partner  in \nsupporting the Government\u2019s efforts to implement the blueprint to improve financial soundness \nand efficiency, restore confidence, attract a broader base of high-quality financial institutions, \nand broaden the sector\u2019s outreach within the blueprint framework. \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2001. Cambodia Financial Sector Blueprint for 2001\u20132010. Manila ", "    Appendix 3  45\n \n5.  The  economy  is  largely  cash-based  and  highly  dollarized.  Dollarization  emerged  in \nCambodia because public confidence in the local currency eroded following a series of shocks \nduring the conflict and financial mismanagement prior to 1989. In some instances, dollarization \nhas assisted development of the financial sector, but, in other respects, dollarization limits the \ntools  the  Government  can  use  in  its  monetary  policies.  With  recent  improvements  in \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  measures  taken  by  the  authorities  to  restore  confidence  in \ninstitutions and in the banking system, public confidence is growing but slowly, and dollarization \nremains high. In the absence of reliable data, the amount of US dollars and other foreign \ncurrencies  circulating  in  Cambodia  cannot  be  verified.  Thai  baht  and  Vietnamese  dong \nbanknotes are also widely used in some of the provinces bordering Thailand and Viet Nam. The \ncash nature of the economy means that even major transactions are settled in cash outside of \nthe banking system and paper trails are minimal.  \n \n6.  The private sector is characterized by a high degree of informality, and it is dominated by \nthe informal sector. Enterprises that have enjoyed years of operating without established rule of \nlaw prefer to remain informal. The tax regime is still very open to negotiation and the majority of \nparticipants in the real sector, especially in rural areas, are reluctant to enter into any form of \nformal financial transactions for fear of being exposed to the tax authorities. Private enterprises \nare generally family-owned with no separation between management and owners who usually \ndo not maintain proper records, including financial reports that can be considered reliable.  \n \n7.  Banking system. No legal barriers are in place for the entry of foreign banks. At the end \nof December 2008, 17 commercial banks had majority foreign ownership. The commercial \nbanking subsector at the end of July 2009 consists of 27 commercial banks, 6 specialized banks, \nand 2 representative offices of foreign-based banks. With the increased number of banks, \ncompetition is starting to pick up and there is some evidence of market segmentation emerging. \nWith the exception of the Rural Development Bank, the banking system is almost entirely owned \nby the private sector. Most banks have established branches in other urban centers and are \nplanning to open additional offices in those areas.  \n \n8.  At the end of March 2009, bank branches reached a total of 355 throughout Cambodia \nand are mostly concentrated in large urban centers, but are gradually changing. ACLEDA Bank, \na former MFI, currently has branches in every province and a total of 226 sites provide banking \nservices. Canadia Bank has 17 branches outside Phnom Penh. Five other banks have more \nthan  three  branches  outside  Phnom  Penh,  including  ANZ  Royal  Bank  (12  branches)  with \nautomated teller machines at each of its branches. At the end of March 2009, bank staff totaled \nmore than 10,012\u2014an increase of almost 45% from the end of 2007, with one bank (ACLEDA) \nemploying 65% and other banks employing the balance. Technical capacity is still weak and \nmost banks provide their own in-house training to complement the training programs offered by \nthe Bankers Association.  \n \n9.  Commercial banking is relatively small but growing quickly. The more aggressive and \nprogressive banks attained average year-on-year growth rates of 57% for credit and 4% for \ndeposits at the end of 2008. The number of commercial bank loans increased by 127% from \n2002 to total 243,835 at the end of May 2009. If these loans were all to individual borrowers, \nthen it would be the equivalent of providing loans to 1.8% of Cambodia\u2019s population. Total \nbanking assets represented about 40% of the estimated gross domestic product (GDP) in May \n2009. The banking system is fairly concentrated, with about 74% of deposits held by the six \nlargest commercial banks. These six also accounted for about 84.6% of total loans at the end of \n2007.   \n \n ", "46  Appendix 3 \n10.  Commercial banks mainly offer simple services to retail and corporate customers in \nurban areas (time and term deposits, savings accounts, basic loans, domestic and cross-border \nwire transfers, foreign exchange, letters of credit, etc.). Specialized banks are not allowed by \nlaw to accept deposits, and commercial banks had about 765,569 depositors (about 6% of the \ntotal population) at the end of May 2009. Most deposit products are short-term in nature and, as \na consequence, loan terms are also short (average 3 years) with high interest rates. Banks \ncontinue to rely on physical collateral and personal guarantee as loan security. More advanced \nbanking services are being introduced, such as electronic banking and private banking. By \nMarch 2009, the number of automated teller machines increased to 345 and will continue to \ngrow as the number of debit cards issued reaches 377,871 (53% increase from the same period \nin 2008) since its introduction to Cambodia in 2006. As of March 2009, 3,383 point-of-sale \nterminals (21% increase from the same period in 2008), which accepted international credit \ncards, have also been installed at various commercial centers\u2014improving direct access to \nfunds.  \n \n11.  The  noncash  payment  system  is  very  small  and  of  limited  sophistication.  It  is \npredominantly paper-based and manual. NBC runs the clearinghouse, which operates in both \nriels and dollars. The riel clearinghouse as of June 2009 has 25 members (NBC, and 24 banks) \nand the US dollar clearinghouse has 29 members (NBC and 28 banks). Daily amounts passing \nthrough the clearinghouses average about $36 million, of which riel clearances represent only \naround  3%.  The  number  of  US  dollar-denominated  checks  cleared  per  day  has  steadily \nincreased from 1,640 in the first quarter of 2008 to more than 1,880 during the first quarter of \n2009. The first clearance is at 9:30 a.m., with a second clearance at 3:00 p.m. to handle returns. \nUnder ADB technical assistance (footnote 8), NBC has modernized its clearinghouse. Banks \ncan send their balances to the clearinghouse electronically through a web-based network. \nInterbank settlement is by check drawn on the banks\u2019 accounts with NBC. The enactment of the \nnegotiable instruments and payment transactions law in late 2005 and the issuance of key \nregulations  in  December  2006  provided  the  legal  framework  for  developing  the  payments \nsystem, introducing new negotiable instruments, and promoting the development of money and \ninterbank markets.  \n \n12.  NBC\u2019s  principal  mission  is  to  formulate  and  implement  monetary  policy  aimed  at \nmaintaining price stability and economic development. Its main functions are to (i) act as the \nmonetary authority and conduct monetary policy (NBC has intervened in the foreign exchange \nmarket to deliver a stable exchange rate and ensure price stability in riels), (ii) act as the sole \nissuer  of  the  national  currency  (as  such  NBC  has  increased  the  number  of  currency \ndenominations and replaced worn and dirty bank notes), (iii) act as the supervisory authority of \nthe  banking  and  financial  system,  (iv)  oversee  the  payments  system  in  Cambodia,  and  \n(v) manage the international reserves of the country.    \n \n13.  The banking supervision program and standards have greatly improved since 2001 and \nhave been extended to cover all banks\u2014a move made possible with the addition of skilled staff. \nPrudential supervision was enhanced with the adoption of the uniform chart of accounts by all \nbanks in 2004, and by the same banks making their annual audited financial statements publicly \navailable since 2005. Most banks have published these annual audited financial statements on \ntheir  own  websites.  In  2006,  NBC  enhanced  its  regulatory  and  supervisory  system  by \nimplementing an off-site supervision system known as Cambodian Bank Reporting for Prompt \nCorrective Action. The system enables staff to perform a regular analysis of off-site reports, to \nidentify  risks  faced  by  banks  and  infringements  caused  by  banks,  and  then  for  the  staff \nconcerned  to  recommend  immediate  actions  to  NBC  management.  The  development  and \nimplementation of the system has been supported by a resident adviser from the International \nMonetary Fund. NBC continues to undertake on-site inspection of each bank once a year. ", "    Appendix 3  47\n \n14.  Banking, along with other financial and commercial subsectors, continues to face high \ntransaction costs attributable to the high costs of funds and absence of reliable information to \nassess risks. The establishment of the credit information sharing system in 2006 should improve \nthe situation, but some time will be required to build a sufficient database. Dispute settlement \nremains a concern and, if unresolved, will continue to affect the degree of certainty associated \nwith financial and commercial transactions. Financial sector stakeholders would undoubtedly \nwelcome the operations of a commercial court that is being developed by the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme and other bilateral development partners and a commercial arbitration \ncenter being established by ADB, to provide a greater degree of certainty. \n \n15.  Microfinance  subsector.  Microfinance  is  growing  rapidly,  with  assets  expanding \ngenerally at around 87% in 2008 and some institutions expanding at 143% per annum. The \nexpansion is allowing microfinance to support and grow the economy, especially in its target \nmarket of the poor and remote rural population. The microfinance subsector at the end of July \n2009  comprises  20  licensed  MFIs,  25  registered  rural  credit  operations,  and  around \n60 nongovernment organizations operating unrestricted across the whole country. Registration \nand  licensing  commenced  in  2002.  A  number  have  transitioned  from  aid-focused \nnongovernment organizations to commercial MFIs, and some were set up as commercial, profit-\noriented MFIs from the outset. Most MFIs have plans to continue rapid expansion, with the \nestablishment of additional branches and increased lending activities at existing branches. \n \n16.  As of the end of May 2009, MFIs had around 807,335 clients (about 6% of the total \npopulation) and loans outstanding with an average size of $305. The expansion in the net \nnumber of loans is currently around 23% per annum. Voluntary savings of MFIs are very small. \nLicensed MFIs have adopted a wide range of business models with good corporate governance \nand orderly market development to deliver their services and products. This was highlighted in \n2007, when Cambodian MFIs won 4 of 20 financial transparency awards presented by the \nConsultative Group to Assist the Poor.    \n \n17.  MFIs  face  major  challenges  to  expanding  their  services,  such  as  competition  from \ninformal operators in their markets. The scale of this competition is anecdotally said to exceed \nthe size of the formal financial sector. However, a survey that was jointly undertaken by the \nMinistry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and NBC in October 2008 concluded that the informal \nsector was much smaller in aggregate size than the formal sector. Further, the informal financial \ninstitutions have the advantage of engaging in small-scale financial transactions on account of \nlower transaction costs and effective loan recovery. A number of costs and challenges are \nimposed on the MFI industry, such as nonresident withholding tax, lack of a reliable method to \ntrack the use of certificates of title for collateral between institutions, and extremely limited \naccess to domestic funding sources. Other challenges include the ability to control business \nprocesses when the scale of operations begins to outstrip the capabilities of current systems \nand processes. Foreign borrowing brings growth and benefits in terms of improved governance \nand transparency, but foreign borrowing brings growing foreign exchange risk as institutions \nincrease their lending in the riel-based rural areas. \n \n18.  Money changers. In addition to banks, the Law on Foreign Exchange, 1997, allows \nindividuals and legal entities to undertake currency exchange if they register with NBC. They are \nnot allowed to undertake any other financial activity. As of the end of May 2009, the country had \n650 registered money changers. Statistics on the transactions undertaken by money changers \nare not available. \n \n ", "48  Appendix 3 \n19.  Insurance subsector. The Department of Financial Industry within MEF is responsible \nfor prudential regulation and supervision of the insurance industry, which consists of one state-\nowned (Caminco) and four private nonlife insurance companies plus a reinsurance company \nthat is 80% state-owned. The sale of 75% of Caminco\u2019s shares to a joint venture comprising an \ninsurance firm from Thailand and a Cambodian investor was concluded in November 2008. The \ninsurance industry is young and small. It has gone through a turbulent period, but with the \nintroduction of regulations and the enforcement of those regulations, stability and growth have \nreturned. The regulator requires the capital of each company to be distributed as follows: 10% \ndeposited with NBC, 50% deposited in commercial banks, with the decision on how to invest the \n40% balance left to the insurance company concerned. Insurance companies have indicated \nthat they would like these ratios to be changed, and the 40% increased. A revision of the \ninsurance law has been initiated by MEF with technical support from ADB. The draft revised \ninsurance law will be submitted to the Council of Ministers in 2009. \n \n20.  Growth has been steady (averaging 11%\u201315% in the last 3 years) from a limited range \nof insurance products. The total gross premiums increased from $17.5 million at the end of 2007 \nto  $20.6  million  at  the  end  of  2008.  The  three  nonlife  categories  of  insurance  products \n(commercial vehicles, construction sites, and passenger vehicle liabilities) underwritten in this \nmarket are compulsory by regulation. Growth has been steady since 2003, with commercial fire \nand miscellaneous policies making up 63% of the market and motor vehicle insurance 19%. \nOther products sold include hospital and surgical, personal and accident, marine cargo, and \ntravelers  insurance.  The  insurance  companies  operating  in  Cambodia  are  conservatively \nmanaged.   \n \n21.  The insurance industry requires a number of specialist skills that are not required in \nother industries. As insurance is a fairly new concept in Cambodia, these specialist skills are not \navailable and need to be acquired (e.g., the skills of underwriters, actuaries, loss adjustors, and \nfund managers). The framework for insurance supervision has been developed, but some \ndeficiencies in terms of capacity for supervision remain and ADB TA during the FSP II has been \nprogressively building staff capacity.  \n \n22.  Capital  market.  Cambodia  has  no  bond  and  securities  markets.  The  Law  on \nGovernment Securities was promulgated by the King on 10 January 2007 and the Law on \nIssuance  and  Trading  of  nongovernment  securities  was  subsequently  promulgated  on \n19 October 2007. Two sub-decrees have been adopted to help implement the latter law: the \nSubdecree on Organization and Functioning of the Securities and Exchange Commission of \nCambodia (SECC) dated 23 July 2008, and the Subdecree on Implementation of the Law on \nTrading  of  nongovernment  securities  dated  8  April  2009.  The  most  recent  short-term \ngovernment securities were issued in 2005. The placement of government securities is jointly \norganized by NBC and the commercial banks. MEF in April 2007 signed a memorandum of \nunderstanding with the Korea International Cooperation Agency for $1.8 million worth of TA to \nhelp  with  the  initial  training  and  preparation  for  establishing  a  securities  market.  The \nGovernment has established the SECC on 29 April 2009 to oversee the preparations for the \neventual establishment of the securities market in the near future. SECC signed a memorandum \nof understanding on 31 July 2009 with the Australian Business Volunteers to provide TA to staff \nof SECC. \n \n23.  Accounting  and  auditing  infrastructure. The continuing growth of the commercial \nsector and the plan for a Cambodia stock market in the near future are creating significant \nchallenges to improving the quality of accounting and auditing, as well as to producing sufficient \nnumbers of qualified accountants. Cambodia has established a legal and regulatory framework \nfor accounting and auditing, but there are implementing weakness still to be overcome such as ", "    Appendix 3  49\nthe enforcement of the accounting and auditing standards. As of May 2008, 20 Cambodian \naccounting standards and 10 Cambodian auditing standards have been introduced based on \ninternational standards. A standards advisory body and a local institute of accountants have \nbeen established to oversee the implementation of these standards. In January 2009, MEF \nissued a prakas (footnote 7) on the promulgation of Cambodian Financial Reporting Standards \nbased on the International Financial Reporting Standards. In addition, the National Accounting \nCouncil is working on developing accounting standards for small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs) based on international standards and best practice. The World Bank is providing TA to \nthe National Accounting Council to help revise and update the accounting law, and review the \naccounting framework with the intention to improve the enforcement of the accounting and \nauditing standards. \n \n24.  The accounting profession is in its infancy. As of June 2009, the 27 public accounting \nand auditing firms employed 82 resident qualified accountants\u201425 of whom are locally qualified. \nCurrently, more than 20,000 companies are registered and the number is growing. The public \naccounting firms have few, if any, local clients. To date, more than 1,300 students have enrolled \nin the international certified public accountant (CPA) qualification course and almost 400 in the \ncertified accounting technician course, but about 30% of the total CPA intake and 20% of the \ntotal certified accounting technician intake have dropped out for various reasons. The World \nBank is providing the Kampuchea Institute of Certified Public Accountants and Auditors with TA \nto help develop an accounting degree curriculum benchmarked on international standards for \nlocal universities, and review the current method of assessing accounting and auditing firms \nwith the intention of formulating a quality assurance framework for assessing accounting and \nauditing firms. \n \n25.  Legal  infrastructure.  An  enabling  legal  framework  for  financial  and  commercial \ntransactions could be achieved by continuing support for Cambodia\u2019s process of law reform, \nincluding for the adoption and implementation of core financial and commercial laws that are \nharmonized  and  aligned  with  the  legal  system.  The  law  reform  process  in  financial  and \ncommercial areas aims to create an enabling environment for the financial sector and for \neconomic growth in general. The Government has taken important steps to prepare, adopt, and \nimplement  certain  major  laws.  The  second  stage  of  development  is  for  additions  and \nrefinements to be made to the legal framework. \n \n26.  The  process  for  enacting  a  new  law  is  subject  to  several  documented  steps.  In  a \ncommon situation, where an international legal expert has provided assistance and produced a \ndraft document in English, the translation into Khmer would take a minimum of 2\u20133 weeks. Then \nthe  process  of  internal  debate  and  consultation  is  held  within  the  ministry  responsible  for \nintroducing the new law. Following these steps, the procedures pertaining to passage of the law \nthrough the Council of Ministers and National Assembly are usually lengthy: approval by the \nCouncil of Ministers typically takes at least 6 months (but usually longer), and the process for \nsubmission to the National Assembly and the approval process within the assembly itself are \nestimated to take about 1 year. Consequently, delay is always a risk at any given stage of the \nlegislative process. \n \n27.  The current court process for the enforcement of collateral is seen as lengthy, uncertain, \nand subject to delays (including for the appeals process). The current situation calls for urgent \nstrengthening of Cambodia\u2019s dispute resolution system, as this is a critical element of the \nemerging financial and commercial legal framework. The introduction of commercial arbitration \nunder the new Law on Commercial Arbitration will be a key mechanism to enforce contracts \nconsistently and resolve commercial disputes fairly. A new commercial court law sponsored by \n ", "50  Appendix 3 \nthe United Nations and other bilateral development partners, still in the planning stages, has the \npotential to improve transparency and finality under clearly established court procedures. \n ", "    Appendix 4  51\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \n \nBanking and Formal Credit  Capital Markets, Corporate \nPrivate Sector, Rural, and \n(including SME and dispute  Governance, and Public Financial \nMicrofinance \nresolution reforms)  Management \nAsian Development Bank  Asian Development Bank  Asian Development Bank \n     \nFSP I   Preparing the FSP I  Rural Credit and Savings Project  \nBudget: $30 million program loan  Budget: $800,000 project  Budget: $20 million project loan \nTime frame: 2001\u20132007  preparatory TA grant  Time frame: 2000\u20132006 \n  Time frame: 2000\u20132007   \nLegal and regulatory foundation for    Credit Facility to Promote Rural and \nbanking, insurance, and commercial  Improving Insurance Supervision  Microfinance Services \ndevelopment;

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Financial Sector Program (FSP) II will support the Government\u2019s continued efforts to strengthen the financial sector via a \ncombination  of  legal  and  regulatory  reforms,  targeted  capacity  building,  improved  disclosure  standards  and  financial \ntransparency, and establishment of key financial infrastructure. By promoting the development of a sound, market-based \nfinancial system to enhance economic growth and the creation of employment opportunities, the FSP II will be pivotal in \nimproving financial intermediation in Cambodia. A sound, efficient, and integrated financial system is crucial for achieving \nbroad-based sustainable economic growth; it will help reduce poverty by increasing job opportunities, lowering the transaction \ncosts of economic activities, and extending the outreach of the formal financial sector to poor and rural areas. An efficient \nfinancial system will promote private sector development and foreign direct investment. Beneficiaries are expected to include \nthe poor and near-poor. A robust financial sector will protect the economy from unfavorable exogenous shocks that are \nbecoming more common in increasingly global financial markets and which have serious implications for the poor. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nThe reform measures proposed under subprogram 3 of the FSP II have no direct impact on the poor or the vulnerable. No \nspecific element requiring poverty analysis was identified in the Program.  \nDesign Features. The policies supported by the FSP II will help increase financial intermediation, improve governance, \nenhance financial stability, and improve efficiency in the financial sector. These factors will contribute to a more conducive \nenvironment for continued financial market development. Subprogram 3 of the FSP II is expected to boost confidence among \nmarket participants and, with improvements to the payments, clearance, and settlement system, financial intermediation will \ngrow. That will result in a wider offering of products and services in urban and rural areas. A sound, more efficient, and \ndiversified financial sector will support higher investments and productivity in the private sector. Together with broader \neconomic reforms, the reforms in the financial sector will contribute to higher economic growth and poverty reduction. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \nA sound, efficient, and integrated financial system is crucial for achieving broad-based sustainable economic growth; it will help \nreduce poverty by increasing job opportunities, lowering transaction costs of economic activities, and extending the outreach of \nthe formal financial sector to poor and rural areas. An efficient financial system will promote private sector development and \nforeign direct investment. Beneficiaries are expected to include the poor and borderline poor. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nSubprogram 3 of the FSP II has no specific component that requires direct social analysis. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nAll reform measures have undergone substantive stakeholder consultations before implementation and the Government will \ncontinue to host the biannual government-private sector forum, which provides an opportunity for the private sector to raise \npolicy issues and for the Government to respond and address them. Regular policy dialogue with stakeholders is to be \nconducted during Asian Development Bank (ADB) review missions. \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.
