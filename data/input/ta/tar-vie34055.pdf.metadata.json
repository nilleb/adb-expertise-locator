INTRODUCTION\n1.  In February 2000, Viet Nam\u2019s Ministry of Finance (MOF) requested Asian Development\nBank (ADB) assistance to enhance the resettlement legal framework and build institutional\ncapacity for involuntary resettlement planning and management. The technical assistance (TA)\nis included in the 2001 country program Viet Nam. Following the TA reconnaissance missions in\nMarch and December 2000, MOF confirmed on 2 May 2001 that the TA would focus on the\npreparation of a new decree for land acquisition, compensation, and resettlement to replace\nDecree 22/CP of 1998, and associated capacity building. The TA Fact-Finding Mission visited\nViet Nam from 17-22 May 2001 and reached an understanding with the Government on the\nobjectives, scope, cost estimates and financing plan, implementation arrangements, and outline\nterms of reference for consulting services for the TA. The TA framework is included in Appendix\n1.1\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2.  The policy and legal framework for land acquisition in Viet Nam has been evolving\nrapidly  over  the  past  decade.  MOF\u2019s  request  to  ADB  is  timed  to  build  on  several  recent\ninitiatives, and bring them to completion. Since 1992 the Viet Nam Constitution has provided a\nlegal basis for compensation to individuals for loss of certain assets. The Land Law of 1993\ninstitutionalized regulations of land allocation, lease, management, time limits, land acquisition\nfor  development  purposes,  land  users\u2019  rights,  and  changes  of  land  value  under  market\nmechanisms. The state assigns land to organizations, households, and individuals for stable\nand permanent use. Under this law, land users utilize and can transfer real property and assets,\nbased on certificates issued by the local government. Users can exchange land, transfer use\nrights to others, rent land to others, bequeath land, or use it as collateral. Article 27 of the Land\nLaw provides for the state to recover land, including for development purposes, upon payment\nof compensation.\n3.  Other relevant documents include the Civil Law of 1995, which became effective on 1\nJuly  1996  and  provides  resident  rights,  and  protection  for  asset  ownership  rights  for\norganizations,  households,  and  individuals.  Decree  52/CP  on  Construction  and  Investment\nManagement requires preparation of a resettlement plan, where necessary, as an integral part\nof the feasibility study, and subsequent project implementation.\n4.  In  1998,  the  Government  approved  Decree  22/CP  and  its  complementary\nImplementation Circular (prepared by MOF), which represents a significant development from\nthe earlier Decree 90/CP of 1994, as it provides consistency in regulation of compensation, and\nassigns specific responsibilities to local authorities. It gives households with legal or legalizable\nland use rights compensation for land and properties attached to land. Other households using\nland but whose land use rights are not legalizable may be assisted.2 While Decree 22/CP\n                  \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 13 June 2001.\n2 Decree 22/CP does not recognize nontitled squatters.  Article 7 states \u201c\u2026.. persons who illegally occupy land shall\nnot receive compensation\u2026\u201d.  \u201cLegalizable\u201d is a term that has been used for World Bank projects in Viet Nam and\nin all resettlement plans in Viet Nam since 1996 when it was agreed that affected persons occupying the right-of-\nway before it was declared a right-of-way, usually on a temporary or lease arrangement with the local government,\nwould be considered as \u201clegalizable\u201d and entitled to compensation and rehabilitation as persons with full legal land\nuse rights, instead of receiving a lower level of entitlement. They are neither squatters nor encroachers. This also\nrefers to the remaining land that these affected persons are occupying beyond the corridor of impact of the project.", "2\nsignificantly strengthens the basis for compensation and rehabilitation when land is acquired for\ndevelopment  purposes,  several  important  gaps  remain  with  ADB\u2019s  policy on  involuntary\nresettlement.\n5.  Since early 2000, MOF has undertaken extensive investigative and consultative work\ntogether with other interested departments, provinces, and municipalities as a basis, initially, for\npreparing an amendment to Decree 22/CP. MOF identified several issues requiring resolution,\nreflecting a need to enhance both the formulation of principles and the application of the\nprinciples in practice. Areas for special focus include land compensation, asset valuation and\npricing, resettlement procedures, and supervision of implementation. These cover the treatment\nof  land  used  before  issuance  of  the  1993  Land  Law,  but  now  recovered;  provisions  to\ncompensate and rehabilitate those without legal or legalizable rights3; the ambiguity in critieria\nfor land compensation; absence of methods to calculate replacement or market rates for land\nacquired; absence of specific regulations to achieve livelihood restoration for those affected;\nless than effective coordination between central and local agencies; inadequate capacity of\nresettlement staff; absence of regulations on internal monitoring, external supervision, and\ninspection  by  MOF;  and  absence  of  specific  guidance  on  resettlement  plan  preparation,\nappraisal, and approval.\n6.  In December 2000 the deputy prime minister confirmed the importance of these issues\nby asking MOF to address them by formulating a new decree to replace Decree 22/CP entirely,\nrather than through a Decree 22/CP amendment. The new decree is intended to set good\nnational standards for land acquisition and resettlement, while taking account of local conditions\nspecific to Viet Nam. Complementary plans are also required to build capacity to implement the\nnew decree consistently, especially at provincial, district, and commune levels.\n7.  ADB\u2019s lending portfolio for 2001-2002 in Viet Nam includes loans in sectors that may\nnecessitate land acquisition. These include transport, urban development, agriculture, and water\nresources. Any resulting displacement of people from land, income sources, housing, or other\nassets  requires  involuntary  resettlement  planning  and  management,  supplemented  by\nindependent  monitoring  and  evaluation,  under  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement.  A\nrecent ADB evaluation study4 found that, in field case study assessment, about one third of\nthose  affected  by  ADB  projects  did  not  restore  their  income  following  resettlement\nimplementation. Resettlement supervision in Viet Nam in 19985 and 2001 found deficiencies in\n   \nIf they can be legalized on that remaining land, they can then move back from the corridor of impact onto that land\nand will be given legal title to that remaining land. Under World Bank- and ADB-assisted projects in Viet Nam,\naffected persons without title are assisted to restore or improve living standards and income levels with improved\nhousing, a plot of land if they are landless, relocation expenses, etc. No legal provision exists for compensation for\nland that is occupied without legal title or other permit, but such people can be \"assisted\u201d on a humanitarian basis.\nArticle 9, Clause 3 of Decree 22/CP stipulates that for a landless \u201cnonlegal\u201d user of land, \u201cthe local administration\nshall consider and assign him new land if possible.\u201d Such persons will also be entitled to special assistance (Article\n18, Clause 2). This makes rehabilitation assistance possible to those without title.\n3 ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement states that absence of formal legal title to land is not a bar to\ncompensation.

The Ministry of\nAgriculture and Rural Development (MARD) subsequently requested ADB assistance in March 1998, for TA to\nbuild capacity for resettlement planning and management for MARD projects, resulting in small-scale TA 3064-VIE:\nStrengthening of Resettlement Management Capacity in MARD, for $150,000 approved on 4 September 1998.", "3\nresettlement planning and implementation, in application of consistent compensation standards\nat the provincial level, and in livelihood restoration.\n8.  In view of the need for streamlined procedures for land acquisition and involuntary\nresettlement in investments, to avoid delays, and to mitigate any risks of displacement-related\nimpoverishment, ADB approved a regional TA to enhance the national macro frameworks for\ninvoluntary resettlement.  The TA,6 which was foreshadowed by ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement\npolicy, resulted in the preparation of national resettlement action plans (NRAPs) to enhance the\npolicy,  legal,  and  administrative  frameworks  in  seven  key  developing  member  countries,\nincluding Viet Nam. The regional TA focal agency for Viet Nam, the Ministry of Planning and\nInvestment, established a regional TA coordinating committee, which included MOF and other\nkey agencies. In May 1999 a national workshop, comprising key departments including MOF\nand civil society stakeholders, reviewed a draft Viet Nam NRAP, the final version of which was\npresented at the TA regional workshop held in Manila in August 1999.  The NRAP for Viet Nam\nincluded a request for ADB TA with the preparation of a new legal instrument on land acquisition\nand resettlement.\n9.  Broadly, the Viet Nam NRAP contains recommendations to (i) formulate a new legal\ninstrument on land acquisition and resettlement to address income restoration and rehabilitation\nof those affected, including households without title and those who are otherwise vulnerable, in\nfull consultation with them; (ii) formulate guidelines for the preparation and management of\nresettlement plans; (iii) establish review, approval, and financing procedures for resettlement\nplans  under  relevant  organizations  responsible  for  the  management  of  investment  and\nconstruction  projects;  (iv)  set  up  resettlement  departments  in  national  organizations  and\nprovinces with significant resettlement activity; and (v) build capacity to implement involuntary\nresettlement plans, including preparation and dissemination of training materials at all levels.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n10. The overall objective of the TA is to improve the living standards and reduce poverty\nrisks of displacement among people affected by land acquisition by establishing principles in\naccordance with good international standards, supported by sound planning and consistent\npolicy implementation. The TA aims to help (i) prepare a new decree on compensation and\nrehabilitation for use when the state recovers land from its citizens; (ii) formulate complementary\nimplementation  guidelines;  and,  upon  approval  of  the  new  decree,  (iii)  build  capacity  to\nimplement  these  legal  instruments.  The  decree  and  guidelines  are  intended  both  for\ninternationally  and  domestically-  financed  investments,  and  will  reflect  ADB\u2019s  involuntary\nresettlement policy; lessons learned from past projects; and requirements of the 1995 Civil Law,\nthe 1993 Land Law, and Decree 52/CP.  This includes compensation at replacement rates for\nboth titled and nontitled persons.\n                  \n6 TA 5781-REG: Review of National Resettlement Policies and Experience with Involuntary Resettlement Projects,\nfor $831,000, approved 10 March 1998. The seven participating countries were Bangladesh, Peoples\u2019 Republic of\nChina, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan,  Philippines, and Viet Nam.", "4\nB.  Scope\n11. The  major  outputs  will  be  a  new  decree  on  land  acquisition  in  the  public  interest,\ncompensation, and rehabilitation, together with complementary implementation guidelines; and\nrelated capacity building. The TA will be conducted in three parts. Phase 1 (8 months) covers\nthe preparation of the new decree and implementation guidelines. Phase 2 (4 months) provides\nfor submission of the new decree to the Office of Government, and Government approval.\nPhase 3 (6 months) comprises the capacity building activities, and is dependent upon approval\nof the new decree during phase 2.\n12.  Several documents will be used to prepare the new decree: MOF\u2019s draft Decree 22/CP\nand supporting implementation circular, dated December 2000; MOF\u2019s first draft of the new\ndecree dated April 2001; and a model compensation and resettlement decree prepared by the\nWorld Bank in 1998.7  The TA will supplement this material with research on specific topics of\nconcern. MOF staff and TA team members will also be invited to attend the ADB regional\nseminar on resettlement policy and legal frameworks, planned for late 2001, to exchange ideas\non good practice. Once a working draft of the new decree is prepared, MOF will arrange a\nnational resettlement policy workshop early in 2002 to consider the draft, with participants drawn\nfrom a range of government and civil society stakeholder groups. Following this, MOF will\nsubmit the new decree for approval.\n13.  Once the decree is approved, phase 3 will conduct a training needs assessment, and\ndevelop a dissemination and training program for implementation during the TA and beyond.\nThe program will be considered at a national resettlement policy implementation workshop and\nrelated consultations. This workshop provides an important opportunity for disseminating the\ncontents of the new legal instruments. The training program will be initiated under the TA,\nincluding trials and tests of new materials and training approaches, especially for line agencies,\nand provincial, district, and local staff undertaking resettlement planning and implementation.\nMOF, or a national training institute nominated by MOF, will conduct subsequent training.\n14.  The new decree will basically conform to good international practice and ADB policy,\nwhile recognizing the specific features of Viet Nam\u2019s legal, land, and social systems.  Issues to\nbe  addressed  are  as  follows:  the  need  to  (i)  specify  procedures  and  requirements  for\nresettlement  planning  as  preconditions  for  project  approval;  and  for  reviewing,  approving,\nimplementing,  monitoring,  and  evaluating  resettlement  plans;  (ii)  confirm  the  overarching\nprinciple of restoring the incomes and improving the living standards of the people affected; (iii)\nincrease the responsibility of the Compensation and Land Clearance Council to encompass\nrehabilitation and income restoration, in addition to asset compensation, with special attention to\npoor and vulnerable groups, and specify the role of the project owners in this council; (iv)\ndevelop procedures for relocation site development, including procedures for mobilizing the\nnecessary finances; (v) provide for consultation with people affected and for grievance redress\nmechanisms;  (vi)  include  procedures  to  mobilize  the  necessary  budgets;  and  (vii)  resolve\nseveral  outstanding  issues,  including  compensation  for  land  losses  for  households  and\nindividuals,  for  legal,  legalizable,  and  nonlegal  people  affected,  at  replacement  rates;  the\nmethod for calculating compensation for temporary losses at replacement rates, etc; and the\nidentification of legal status of houses and structures in protected areas.\n                  \n7 The General Department of Land Administration has also recently issued a land valuation training manual.", "5\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n15.   The TA is estimated to cost $387,500 equivalent, of which $204,000 is the foreign\nexchange cost and $183,500 equivalent the local currency cost. ADB will provide $310,000 to\ncover all the foreign exchange cost and $106,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA\nwill be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program. The Government\nwill  provide  $77,500  equivalent  in  the  form  of  counterpart  and  support  staff,  office\naccommodation, and other related services and facilities. The detailed cost estimates and\nfinancing plan are presented in Appendix 2.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n16.  MOF will be the Executing Agency for the TA.  MOF will assemble a steering committee\ncomposed  of  other  agencies,  including  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment,  Office  of  the\nGovernment, Ministry of Justice, and General Department of Land Administration. The vice-\nminister of finance will chair the steering committee, with technical direction from the MOF\nDepartment for the Management of Public Assets. MOF will provide office space, support staff,\nand administrative support for the TA. MOF will assign two technical specialists to work closely\nwith  the  international  and  domestic  consultants,  and  arrange  the  services  of  a\ntranslator/interpreter as required.\n17.   The TA will finance one international consultant with expertise in resettlement policy\ndevelopment and legal procedures, preferably with Viet Nam country experience. Domestic\nconsultants  will  also  be  required.  The  consultants  will,  between  them,  have  expertise  in\nresettlement policy and legal frameworks, asset valuation, land management assessments,\npoverty assessments, applied social research, participative approaches, and gender analysis.\nOutline terms of reference are presented in Appendix 3. The consultants will be engaged by\nADB  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants on an individual basis. Office\nequipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\n18.   The TA will commence in October 2001 and finish by April 2003. Within one month of TA\ncommencement, the TA team will prepare an inception report including a work plan and work\nschedule with specific target dates and outputs. Following this, the TA team will report quarterly\non plans for the next quarter, and progress achieved during the previous quarter. The output\nfrom phase 1 will be the complete draft of the new decree, together with the implementation\nguidelines.  An  English  translation  is  also  required.  The  output  of  phase  2,  which  is  the\nresponsibility  of  MOF,  is  the  approved  decree  and  guidelines  in  Vietnamese  and  English\nlanguages. The outputs from phase 3 are the training needs assessment and training program,\ntogether with training materials and evaluation reports from the trial application of the training\nprogram. The final TA output will be a revised training program and materials. In addition, the\nTA team will prepare a workshop report for each of the national workshops.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n19. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of Viet Nam in an amount\nnot exceeding the equivalent of $310,000 for the purpose of Enhancing the Resettlement Legal\nFramework and Institutional Capacity, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "6\nAppendix 1, page 1\n                          TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  FRAMEWORK\nMonitoring Risks and\n Design Summary Targets\nMechanisms Assumptions\n1.
