INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  regional  cooperation  and  integration  (RCI)  strategy 1   adopted  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in 2006 identified trade and investment cooperation and integration \nas the second of four pillars. Trade and investment facilitation is furthermore included in pillar 1 \nof the RCI strategy as cross-border trade infrastructure and related software, an element of \nregional trade integration. ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020)2 \nemphasizes that RCI has vast potential for accelerating economic growth, reducing poverty and \neconomic disparity in Asia, raising productivity and employment, and strengthening institutions. \nHence, RCI is one of the three pillars of ADB\u2019s vision and strategic agenda 2020. In line with the \nstrategic priority, ADB has committed to scaling up its support for RCI. ADB will do this by \nexpanding the creation of knowledge and information on RCI and disseminating this knowledge \nand  information  to  developing  member  countries  (DMCs).  ADB  will  do  this  by  increasing \nactivities that promote RCI, especially in the South Asia subregion, where trade and investment \nintegration  in  intraregional  supply  chains,  logistical  systems,  and  service  and  production \nnetworks has been trailing and the benefits are most needed. \n \n2.  The  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  defines  Aid  for  Trade  (AfT)  as  donor  funds \nchanneled to finance trade-related technical assistance (TA) and infrastructure, plus aid used to \ndevelop new productive, supply-side capacity. In 2006, a 13-member task force was established \nunder the leadership of WTO to produce a series of recommendations on how to put AfT into \noperation and how it should contribute to the development dimension of the Doha Development \nAgenda.  The  same  year,  regional  development  bank  presidents,  including  ADB  President \nHaruhiko Kuroda, strongly endorsed AfT, acknowledging WTO\u2019s call for them to play key roles. \nOn 19 and 20 September 2007, ADB held the Asia regional review meeting in Manila to foster \ndialogue among senior government officials, private sector representatives, and donors about \nwhat is working in the region and what is not. The result of the discussions was a series of \nproposals and recommendations on how AfT should proceed in Asia and, more specifically, in \nSouth Asia. In the review meeting, South Asian participants encouraged recipient countries or \nsubregions to formulate business plans for AfT and create a road map and secure political \ncommitment to follow through on the AfT agenda in the region.3 At the global AfT review \nmeeting in Geneva in 2008, ADB committed to implementing an AfT road map for the Asia \nPacific. This commitment has gained prominence in the adverse world trade climate, which \naffects least developed countries\u2019 business most because of their low capacity to trade. The \nclimate leads to further long-term exclusions from production networks. This TA helps to fulfill \nthis commitment as detailed in the TA design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The  Need  to  Address  the  Underdevelopment  of  South  Asian  Service  and \nProduction Network Integration in Asia. International and regional economic integration has \nbeen a driving force in helping shape economic development in South Asia. International and \nregional  economic  integration  is  a  process  associated  with  falling  tariff  and nontariff  trade \nbarriers, rapid technological progress and productivity growth, and declining communications \nand logistics costs. The growth of regional service and production networks in Asia has allowed \nenterprises to tap far larger markets in a much more cost effective manner, leading to greater \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 12 December 2008. \n ", "2   \nregional economic integration. However, South Asia is still the least-integrated region in Asia. Its \nsmaller  and  landlocked  economies  have  been  only  marginally  integrated  into  the  dynamic \nprocess  of  economic  integration.  Most  noteworthy  is  that  the  underperformance  of  these \ncountries  directly  correlates  with  high  trade  and  business  costs.  This  huge  gap  in  trade \nefficiency is also evident in logistics, production technology, marketing and market access, and \nother export-related capabilities. \n \n4.  The Kali and Reyes (2006) calculation4 of a \u201ctrade centrality index,\u201d done for most \ncountries in the world, reflects each economy\u2019s number of trading partners and influence on the \nservice and production networks that connect inputs to products and services via vertically \nintegrated trade networks across many countries to the customers for the final product or \nservice. A high relative value of centrality, on a scale of 0 to 100, reflects a central position of \ninfluence in key global service and production networks. For South Asia, this measure provides \nimportant insights into global trade positioning. South Asia is still relatively marginal to global \nservice and production networks for outsourcing and integration, in comparison with the key \nplayers Europe, Japan, United States, and increasingly the People's Republic of China. Of all \nthe economies in South Asia, India has the most centrally connected trade economy and Nepal \nthe least. \n \n5.  It is clear that South Asia\u2019s competitive advantage in regional and international trade \nrests on how effectively it can improve and invest in its logistics infrastructure, service, and \nproduction supply chains that link suppliers via vertically integrated trade networks to customer \ndemand. Traditional competitive advantage from proximity to raw materials or cheap labor has \nincreasingly been replaced in recent decades by proximity to markets. The business capacity, \nespecially of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to produce time- and quality-sensitive \nconsumer goods and services has to be raised. Here, AfT can be put to work with great benefit \nto the subregion. \n \n6.  The Need to Scale Up a New Type of AfT Operation. ADB\u2019s South Asia Department \n(SARD) has not so far given priority to trade-oriented capacity building, service and production \nnetwork integration, or logistics. However, trade and logistics are important pillars in the RCI \nstrategy and in Strategy 2020. AfT requires mainstreaming in DMC development investment \nprograms to explicitly recognize the priority of AfT-type coordinated and interlinked activities in \ncountry operations. This means that ADB generally, and SARD specifically, needs to strengthen \ntrade-related impact analysis and capacity in its operations.  \n \n7.  To mainstream and scale up AfT operations in the context of the new Asian AfT initiative \nassociated with WTO\u2019s global initiative, a new set of interlinked AfT-type operations needs \ndetailed preparation. In response to the South Asian need for greater integration into global \nservice and production networks, the TA will outline a strategic investment framework. One \ngeneral strategy for South Asian DMCs is to diversify trade in terms of sectors and markets. \nThis is especially important for Bangladesh, Maldives, and Nepal, as their export markets are \nfew and therefore vulnerable, and access to them can become increasingly precarious. Another \nstrategy for smaller or landlocked economies is to move into niche markets, possibly with higher \nvalue added, and to use subcontracting networks in larger, closer markets such as India. All of \nthese options require a road map for investment in complete service and production chains and \nnetworks, together with the necessary logistics and infrastructure investment. \n \n                                                 \n4  Kali, R. and J. Reyes. 2006. The Architecture of Globalization: A Network Approach to International Economic \nIntegration. Journal of International Business Statistics 38: 595\u2013620.  \n ", "  3\n8.  The Need to Increase Cooperation Capacity of Trade Officials, Especially in Small \nand Low-Income South Asian Economies. The September 2007 regional review meeting for \nAfT in Asia brought together in a working group all the key trade officials representing nodal \npoints for AfT, especially in the smaller and lower-income economies. There was a strong \nexpression of the need for ADB support in building knowledge and technical capacity in those \nnodal points and agencies. This TA will involve those nodal points in developing a subregional \nAfT strategy and road map, and it will do so through training and workshops. Building upon \nADB\u2019s experience and partnership with global and regional development institutions, this TA \naims to sustain and deepen the integration and trade facilitation efforts of the South Asia \nsubregion. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  Lowering trade and transaction costs in South Asian economies by 5% of traded value, \nthrough  trade  policy  reform,  trade-related  infrastructure  investment,  and  supply  capacity \nexpansion, can generate a real income gain of about 2.5% of gross domestic project.5 The \nincome gains and, in turn, poverty reduction gains emanate from the increased trade creation \nand the shift to more productive and better-paid employment.  \n \n10.  As the TA produces an AfT business plan and helps create national road maps, the \ngreater political commitment increases the trade focus in the subregion and globally in line with \nthe economic size and potential of South Asian economies. The aim is to identify and prepare \nfor  South  Asian  economies  (excluding  for  now  Pakistan)  a  set  of  AfT  interventions  that \nimplement the general strategies. It is important for this assistance to structure an applied \nframework for prioritizing potential trade-related interventions and investments according to the \nexpected  strength  of  their  economic  impacts.  Also  important  is  to  evaluate  the \ncomplementarities  and  positive  economic  spillovers  that  a  set  of  interventions  offers  in \ncomparison with one-off interventions. The object of such calculation is to work out the effective \nbalance between trade-related investments, as substantial economies come out of investing in \ncomponents in correct proportions. What is important is to look at all the service and production \nnetworks that can be developed in a network of investments across the subregion.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The regional policy and advisory TA output will be national road maps for AfT and \nrelated investment. One priority will be to map service and production networks across the \nsubregion, thereby linking into Asia and the role of SMEs in key sectors, which is expected to \nproduce high economic impact in terms of export growth, employment generation, and poverty \nreduction. A very high priority will be to focus on key SME export sectors and service and \nproduction  networks,  which  will  help  diversify  low-income  and  small  economy  exports  into \npotentially  competitive  products  and  services  with  good  market  access.  For  instance, \nBangladesh now relies almost exclusively on garment exports to maintain its trade account,  \nand the Maldives on tourism, so both need to develop second and third legs to support export \neconomies and employment.  \n \n12.  A succinct country-based subregional proposal for investments will be crafted to provide \na practical framework for operationalizing AfT in the South Asia subregion. It is envisaged that \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2006. Asian Development Outlook. Manila (page 294). \n ", "4   \nthe proposal will synthesize specific AfT needs, objectives, activities, and actors across the \nsubregion. The proposal will include an implementation schedule, define financing needs, and \nstructure a monitoring framework based on the Paris Principles.6 The draft proposal will be \nvetted by an eminent expert panel and presented at national, subregional, and international \nforums, as well as at scoping and stock-taking meetings. Such meetings and workshops will \nserve to train trade officials in nodal points and agencies of DMCs, strengthening institutional \ncapacity for cooperation. \n \n13.  The road map proposal will come up with an applied framework for prioritizing potential \ntrade-related  interventions  and  investments  according  to  the  expected  strength  of  their \neconomic impacts. Also important is to evaluate the complementarities and positive economic \nspillovers that a set of interventions offers in comparison with one-off interventions. The object \nof such calculation is to work out the effective balance between trade-related investments, as \nsubstantial economies come out of investing in components in correct proportions. For each \nsuggested operation, the work will state what additional economic and/or financial value is \ncreated under a new additional type of AfT operation and how it will complement operations in \nthe subregion that are already planned in sectors such as in SMEs; trade finance; transport; \nconnectivity and logistics; trade policy reform; and industrial, agribusiness, and service export. \n \n14.  The regional policy and advisory TA will develop an implementation plan to build up \ninstitutional capacity for developing, regionally coordinating, and implementing road maps. This \nwill result in a rigorous sector framework for investment with suitable indicators that link into the \nADB results framework.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000. It will be financed as a grant from the Investment \nClimate Facilitation Fund under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership \nFacility,7  to be  administered  by  ADB.  It  will  cover  remuneration,  travel,  and  per  diem  for \ninternational  and  national  experts,  as  well  as  for  eminent  resource  persons;  training  and \nworkshop-related  expenditures;  publications;  and  report  and  knowledge  dissemination.  A \ndetailed cost breakdown and proposed financing plan are in Appendix 2. No activity will be \nfinanced in any member country under this TA unless and until a letter of no objection in respect \nof it has been received from its government. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA,  and  the  Financial  Sector,  Public \nManagement, and Trade Division of SARD will administer and implement it. ADB will coordinate \nwith subregional organizations and WTO. The TA will require 13 person-months of international \nexpert inputs, inclusive of resource persons, and 15 person-months of national expert inputs. \nThe  national  consultant(s)  will  be  based  at  ADB  headquarters  and  assist  in  the  overall \nimplementation  of  the  TA.  ADB  will  engage  the  consultant  experts  in  accordance  with  its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The outline terms \nof reference for consultants and eminent resource persons are in Appendix 3. Disbursements \n                                                 \n6  The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, agreed by both donor and beneficiary countries in 2005, includes \nprinciples to guide aid delivery. \n7  Established by the Government of Japan. \n ", "  5\nunder the TA will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook.8 \n \n17.  The quality- and cost-based selection method will be used in selecting the firm to field \nthe international experts in evaluation, results monitoring, trade modeling, value chains, and \nmarket  access.  The  eminent  resource  persons  will  be  selected  directly  and  individually \naccording to their special expertise using quality-based selection. The national consultant(s) will \nbe selected individually.  \n \n18.  The  team  leader  will  submit  an  inception  report  to  the  eminent  resource  persons \nsufficiently in advance of the scoping workshops. One workshop will involve the countries\u2019 nodal \nagencies. After this, the consultant team, under the team leader, will finalize the inception \nreport, inclusive of the work program for interim, midterm and draft final reports. At the AfT \nstock-taking meetings and presentation, the consultants will receive comments that they will \ntake  into  account  in  the  draft  final  report  before  delivering  a  final  report  in hardcopy  and \nelectronic form that includes data and model descriptions and relevant software source codes. \n \n19.  The TA is expected to run for 15 months from April 2009 until July 2010. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund under the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Financing Partnership Facility for the South Asia Strategic Framework for Aid for \nTrade Road Map, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2008.

The principal objective of the integrated value chain analysis is to compile indicative data \nfor priority products to achieve the following six goals: \n(i)  Quantify the effects of the inefficiencies of logistics, current infrastructure network, \nsupporting services, and regulatory impediments on the firm\u2019s competitiveness \nand productivity in the strategic products as identified above.  \n(ii)  Prioritize policy, procedural, and physical constraints along the value chains.  \n(iii)  Compare with internationally recognized benchmarks and standards.  \n(iv)  Recommend policies and interventions to reduce inefficiencies and improve the \ncompetitiveness of the firm. \n(v)  Complete a business proposal and financing plan for four or five key product \nvalue chains.  \n(vi)  Determine investment prefeasibility along key trade networks in the subregion \nand develop a road map for initiating investment.  \n \n2.  The data compiled will reflect cost, time, and reliability factors in obtaining inputs, where \napplicable,  and  delivering  products  to  the  final  markets  identified.  The  analysis  needs  to \nconsider the time taken for the various activities along the chain, for instance from the point \nwhere the goods are picked up from a factory or field until they are delivered to the final market. \nIn the case of transport nodes and sea movement, specific information needs to be gathered, \nwhile the cost of container movement needs to be quantified. Specifically, the consultant will \nprovide a cost and time estimate of the major steps in the value chain of each product and \nservice.  As  such,  the  consultants  must  be  familiar  with  related  donor  work,  specifically \nGovernment of Japan diagnostic studies of trade integration and the work by the Japanese \noverseas development assistance task force in Bangladesh. \n3.  Prefeasibility analysis will include, but not be limited to, the following:  \n(i)  Measure cost and time along the entire supply chain of a product\u2014including \nlogistics costs and time in moving the products on selected routes within the \ncountry, in the region, and in international markets\u2014and quantify the impact of \nthese costs on firm competitiveness in responding to markets, demand, and \ncompetition.   \n(ii)  This exercise will be undertaken for both informal and formal producers in the \nvalue chain to understand such implications of operating a formal business as \nlicensing, taxes, the time required to comply with existing laws and regulations, \nand other public sector costs, as well as the implications of running an informal \nbusiness, in which an operator may be required to pay bribes and other informal \npayments to participate in markets.  \n(iii)  Benchmark costs against a similar value chain in a similar market regionally and \ninternationally to identify specific areas where producers in the subregion are \nmost inefficient and how they can become the most efficient in their market \nsegment.  \n(iv)  Establish investment costs with subproject details to mitigate such inefficiencies. \n \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n \n2.

The evaluation and results monitoring expert will devise an applied framework for \nprioritizing  potential  trade-related  interventions  and  investments  according  to  the  expected \nstrength of their economic impacts. Also important is to evaluate the complementarities and \npositive  economic  spillovers  that  a  set  of  interventions  offers  in  comparison  with  one-off \ninterventions. The object of such calculation is to work out the effective balance between trade-\nrelated investments, as substantial economies come out of investing in components in correct \nproportions. Using the model, the consultant will undertake analysis based on trade benefit \ncreation,  including  producer,  productivity,  and  employment  benefits  and  related  to  the \ngeographic location of investment and the geographic location of potential benefits.1 For each \nsuggested operation, the consultant\u2019s work will state what additional economic and/or financial \nvalue is created under an additional type of Aid for Trade (AfT) operation and how it will \ncomplement operations in the subregion that are already planned in sectors such as small and \nmedium-sized  enterprises;  transport;  connectivity  and  logistics;  trade  policy  reform;  and \nindustrial, agribusiness, and service export.
