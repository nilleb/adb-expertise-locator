INTRODUCTION \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) will summarize expected climate change phenomena and \nimpacts in the various climate zones of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), assess climate \nchange risks, review and assess relevant knowledge resources, and prepare international and \ndomestic good practice cases on urban climate change adaptation (UCCA). It will align, and as \nmuch as possible, link to global and regional climate change adaptation initiatives.1 It will be \ncoordinated and create synergies with other ongoing TA projects both in the PRC and throughout \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB). UCCA tool kits will be compiled using readily available best \npractice examples.  \n \n2.  The TA will prepare technical guidelines aimed at providing options to improve and \nmainstream UCCA in the PRC. The guidelines will consider the PRC\u2019s various geographical \nclimate risks on urban areas, infrastructure, and assets for various types of cities; and risks to \npublic safety and human health. The UCCA guidelines will include recommendations for planning \nand actions for existing and new urban areas. They will also consider integrated land use and \nadaptation planning, and options for ecosystem-based adaptation\u2014especially for planning new \nurban areas\u2014using green infrastructure in the form of green space and various synergies that \necosystem services provide.  \n \n3.  The TA will develop and improve policies, institutional arrangements, and governance to \n(i) observe climate change; (ii) plan climate-proof and resilient adaptation for existing urban areas; \n(iii) plan climate-resilient new urban areas integrating land use, transport, and green open space, \napplying an ecosystem-based adaptation approach; and (iv) review and improve the city-level \nearly warning system and mechanisms. The executing agency will select pilot cities from a pool \nof pre-selected cities. The TA will provide training and support to apply the technical guidelines \nand  institutional  arrangements,  and  test  smart  city  and  geographic  information  system \napplications to improve UCCA. It will include capacity building in the form of disseminated reports, \nconsultations with line agencies, workshops, and training events as well as on-the-job training for \nthe executing agency and pilot cities. The TA is included in the country operations and business \nplan, 2017\u20132019 for the PRC.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Climate change has led to an increase in extreme weather in recent years, resulting in \ndisasters that claimed numerous lives, damaged assets, and adversely impacted livelihoods \nglobally, especially in Asia, including the PRC. Disasters have been exacerbated by unsuitable \nland use planning and urban development in flood-prone areas; and unintegrated, isolated flood \nprotection structures as opposed to watershed-wide flood risk management. The future impacts \nof climate change are expected to be even more frequent and severe.3 Mitigating more severe \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2015.

At the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties in Paris in December 2015, all \nparticipating countries agreed to limit global warming to below 2.0 degrees Celsius (\u00b0C).4 However, \nfor the PRC, a significant temperature increase by up to 4.5\u00b0C in the north and west, and by up \nto 3.0\u00b0C in the southeast, is projected by 2100 compared with 1960\u20131990 averages; and a \nprecipitation increase of up to 20% is expected in the PRC\u2019s northeast.5  \n \n5.  Climate change-related impacts include heat stress, droughts, more evaporation, food and \nwater insecurity, water pollution, sea level rise and storm surges, inland flooding, extreme weather \nevents, heavy rainfall and strong winds, ocean acidification, and accelerated environmental \ndegradation. Urban areas are particularly exposed to the adverse impacts of climate change since \nmany cities are in low-lying river and coastal areas, and have high concentrations of residents, \ninfrastructure, and fixed assets. Continuing rapid urbanization, and the expected increase in the \nfrequency and severity of climate change-related disasters, increase risk exposure.6 The need for \ncomprehensive  UCCA  is  urgent:  (i)  climate-proofing  existing  cities  and  infrastructures, \n(ii) planning new urban areas to be climate change resilient, and (iii) establishing early warning \nsystems for disaster preparedness and response. Successful UCCA through structural and \nnonstructural measures, as demonstrated in selected water, food, energy, and transport projects, \nwill lead to more resilient cities and communities, and contribute to the achievement of the \nSustainable Development Goals. Cities and their energy, transport, industry, and building systems \nas well as residents\u2019 lifestyle choices have the greatest potential for reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions, especially in rapidly growing and industrializing economies. Green infrastructure and \necosystem-based adaptation, low-carbon buildings, energy, transport, and industries have the \npotential to reduce emissions while contributing to increasing climate change resilience. However, \nmany rapidly developing cities lack adequate policies, as well as the financial, technological, \ninstitutional, and governance capacity required for effective mitigation and adaptation, and the \nsynergies created by integrating them. \n \n6.  The PRC released a National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy in 2013, indicating the \ntypes of adaptation measures that should be adopted, including enhancing risk management and \nimproving disaster response systems affecting human health, infrastructure, and other private \nand public investments.7 To implement the strategy, the National Development and Reform \nCommission, the Ministry of Housing and Urban\u2013Rural Development, and other relevant line \nministries released the UCCA Action Plan (UCCAAP).8  \n \n7.  Current technical  standards for  land  use,  urban  master  planning,  infrastructure  and \nbuilding construction, operation, and maintenance do not adequately incorporate climate change \nprojections or their potential risks. Critical urban and urban\u2013rural infrastructure and public and \nprivate fixed assets are not designed to withstand climate change-related shocks and stresses, \nand are not designed as systems to mitigate the impacts  of disasters. The UCCAAP is a policy \ndocument  that  needs  to  be  complemented  by  technical  guidelines,  a  framework  defining \ninstitutional coordination and responsibilities, and implementation arrangements to enable city \n                                                \n4  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 2015.

The TA is urgently needed to support the development and pilot \ntesting of technical guidelines, policies, and administrative regulations to implement the UCCAAP, \nto enable mainstreaming of UCCA in the PRC.  \n \n8.  The TA builds on significant experience and links to ongoing ADB projects, which include \nthe following loans, TA projects, and knowledge products: (i) Jiangxi Pingxiang Integrated Rural\u2013\nUrban Infrastructure Development, (ii) Institutionalization of Urban\u2013Rural Environmental Master \nPlanning to Guide Environmentally Sustainable Urbanization, (iii) Modeling Urban Low-Carbon \nDevelopment in Xiangtan, (iv) Building Climate Change Resilience in Asia\u2019s Critical Infrastructure; \n(v) Enhancing Urban Climate Change Resilience: Seven Entry Points for Action, and (vi) Nature-\nBased Solutions for Building Resilience in Towns and Cities: Case Studies from the Greater \nMekong Subregion.9 The TA will also align with international adaptation knowledge and initiatives, \nand it will consider gender and vulnerable people\u2019s aspects of climate risk and resilience. The \ntechnical guidelines will include risks and action categories, and methods for assessing risks and \nvulnerabilities of cities and urban\u2013rural areas, peoples\u2019 lives, health and livelihoods, and public \nand private assets.  \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the strategic priorities of the ADB Midterm Review of Strategy \n2020 and the country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for the PRC (footnote 6) to support the \npriority of managing climate change and the environment.10 By supporting the PRC\u2019s efforts to \nimprove and mainstream UCCA, this TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan, 2012\u2013\n2020. It is also in line with the key policies of the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020; \nthe National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (2013); the National UCCAAP (2016); and key \nstrategies of the PRC\u2019s National New-Type Urbanization Plan, 2014\u20132020, as well as related \npolicies and programs by the Ministry of Housing and Urban\u2013Rural Development, including Low-\nCarbon Eco-Cities and Sponge Cities.11   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: urban and urban\u2013rural climate change \nadaptation systems and capacities in the PRC improved and mainstreamed. This is aligned with \ndirections identified in the ADB Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 (footnote 10) and the PRC\u2019s \nThirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 (footnote 11); and the PRC\u2019s UCCAAP (footnote 8).  The \nTA will have the following outcome: technical guidelines, policies, and institutional arrangements \nfor  urban  and  urban\u2013rural  climate  change  adaptation,  and  mechanisms  for  mainstreaming \nresilience to extreme weather events in the PRC enhanced.12  \n                                                \n9  ADB.  2014.

This \noutput will include documentation of international and national good practices, technical solutions, \npolicies, institutional arrangements, and theoretical literature on UCCA; and assess applicability \nin the PRC for planning and implementation. Lessons will also be drawn from institutional \narrangements and responsibilities, and cross-department cooperation within local and provincial \ngovernments  for  UCCA  planning,  investment  prioritization,  plan  implementation,  and  for \nnonstructural measures like early warning and disaster response. The technical guidelines and \npolicy recommendations will include a list of action categories and methods for assessing risks \nand vulnerabilities of climate change to cities and urban\u2013rural areas, peoples\u2019 lives, health and \nlivelihoods, and public and private assets. The technical manual will include options for structural \nand nonstructural interventions for UCCA for both existing and newly planned urban areas. \nStructural measures will include green infrastructure to benefit from various ecosystem services, \nintegrated climate-resilient infrastructure and private assets planning, climate-proofing of existing \ninfrastructure  systems,  and  retrofitting  of  existing  assets  and  infrastructure.  The  technical \nguidelines will also include dimensions of UCCA improving resilience, public health, and making \nresilience socially and gender inclusive. Nonstructural measures include general awareness of \nclimate change related exposure to risks, and awareness of early warning systems and disaster \nresponse mechanisms developed. \n \n12.  Output 2: Support to pilot cities in urban climate change adaptation action planning \nof structural and nonstructural measures; and testing and refining of technical guidelines, \npolicies,  and  implementation  arrangements  completed.

Activities will \ninclude (i) on-the-job training and workshops in pilot cities, (ii) workshops for concerned agencies, \nand (iii) dissemination of TA outputs and recommendations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).13 The government will \nprovide counterpart support equivalent to $50,000 in the form of counterpart staff, secretarial \nassistance, and other in-kind contributions. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n15.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff, \nsecretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will administer the TA. The East Asia Department will select, supervise, and evaluate \nconsultants, organize workshops, and provide staff to act as resource persons in the workshops. \n                                                \n13 Application for additional funding of TA activities contributing to output 2 from the Cities Development Initiative for \nAsia may be explored at a later time. \n ", "5 \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  August 2017\u2013September 2018 \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Housing and Urban\u2013Rural Development \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  QCBS (90:10)  25 person-months  $400,000 \n  ICS  7 person-months  $80,000 \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICS = Individual Consultant Selection, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, TA \n= technical assistance.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n17.
