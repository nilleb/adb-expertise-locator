Introduction \n \n1.  In May 2020, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved the Knowledge and \nSupport Technical Assistance (KSTA) Kingdom of Cambodia: Supporting Digital Cambodia for \nInclusive Development Project (https://). The KSTA is designed to support the Royal Government \nof Cambodia (RGC) to support its vision of digital Cambodia by mainstreaming digital technology \nin public administration and service. The TA includes two outputs:(i) output 1 is an integrated ICT \nplatform for social protection programs developed and applied in two districts and the capacity of \nthe stakeholder agencies enhanced; and (ii) output 2 is a feasibility study on a scalable e- \ngovernment  model  at  sub-national  level  conducted  and  capacity  of  the  target  subnational \nadministrations (SNAs) enhanced. The draft terms of reference include detailed activities for the \ntechnical team to undertake as part of the assignment under output 1. \n \nII. Assignment Background \n \n2.  The RGC introduced a new Social Protection Policy Framework in 2017. ID Poor, a central \ntargeting mechanism for poor households, is the main tool for registering the poor and is managed \nby the Ministry of Planning (MOP). The RGC is implementing various social protection programs \nand plans to expand these programs in term of coverage and type of services. However, there \nare many challenges in the delivery of social benefits, including limited coverage, inaccurate \ntarget beneficiaries, and inefficient management of the various social protection programs. There \nis no universal and easily verifiable identification mechanism that every resident can leverage for \navailing public and social services in Cambodia. To address these challenges, the National Social \nProtection Council (NSPC), the national agency in charge of the social protection programs, plans \nto develop an integrated IT-based service delivery system supporting various social protection \nprograms. \n \n3.  The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), which chairs the NSPC, is spearheading \nthe social protection reform and requests ADB technical assistance to support development of \nthe social protection registration system. Responding to the request, a diagnostic study on ICT \nfor social protection in Cambodia was carried out in 2019 under the ADB-funded Inclusive Finance \nSector Development Program, Subprogram 2.1 The study found that social protection programs \nare largely fragmented causing inefficiencies in administration  and delivery of services and \nrecommended to establish an IT-enabled service delivery platform which can be used not only for \nsocial protection programs but also for other social services across the country. \n \nIII. Assignment Objectives and Scopes \n \n4.  Output  1  aims  to  develop  an  integrated  ICT  platform  to  provide  end-to-end  social \nprotection programs in  Cambodia. The TA  will analyze and  re-engineer the key business \nprocesses  of  the  social  protection  programs  including  registration,  identification  of  eligible \nindividuals  or  households,  enrolment  of  participants,  delivery  of  social  services  after \nauthentication, and monitoring of social protection schemes. To adequately demonstrate the utility \nof the integrated digital platform for social protection service delivery, initially two social protection \nschemes, namely the health insurance program under the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the \n \n1  ADB. 2019. Inclusive Financial Sector Development Program, Subprogram 2. Manila. \n \n ", " \nSupporting Digital Cambodia for Inclusive Development Project KSTA 6681-CAM (53308-001)  \n \nconditional cash transfer program under the Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans, and  Youth \nRehabilitation (MOSAVY), will be targeted in a limited geographic scale. Subsequently, the digital \nplatform will be integrated with the national ID system for more efficient and effective service \ndelivery. The digital platform is expected to be further expanded to include other social protection \nprograms and scaled up after the lifespan of the TA. The targeted beneficiary population will be \napproximately  10,000  in  two  districts  that  will  be  identified  at  an  early  stage  of  the  TA \nimplementation. Under this output, a brief cost and benefit analysis will be conducted, technical \nadvisory service will be provided, and capacity development programs will be provided for the \nstakeholder agencies. The TA team will collaborate with ADB\u2019s Social Development Thematic \nGroup with respect to social and gender analysis, monitoring, communication, and public outreach. \n \n5.  The  two  outputs  will  result  in  the  following  outcome:  efficiency,  effectiveness,  and \naccountability in delivery of selected public and social services in target districts improved. The \nimpact of the TA\u2019s aligned with livelihoods of disadvantaged groups including women and children \nimproved. The TA will enable the RGC to benefit from ADB technical expertise, accessing to \nregional experiences, and will link to ADB\u2019s ongoing projects. \n \nIV.

Feasibility Study on the Standardized e-Government System for Subnational \nAdministrations in Cambodia \n \n \nI. Introduction \n \n1.  In May 2020, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved the Knowledge and \nSupport Technical Assistance (KSTA) Kingdom of Cambodia: Supporting Digital Cambodia for \nInclusive Development Project (https://). The KSTA is designed to support the Royal Government \nof Cambodia (RGC) to support its vision of digital Cambodia by mainstreaming digital technology \nin public administration and service. The TA includes two outputs: (i) output 1 is an integrated ICT \nplatform for social protection programs developed and applied in two districts and the capacity of \nthe stakeholder agencies enhanced; and (ii) output 2 is a feasibility study on a scalable e- \ngovernment  model  at  sub-national  level  conducted  and  capacity  of  the  target  subnational \nadministrations (SNAs) enhanced. The draft terms of reference include detailed activities for the \ntechnical team to undertake as part of the assignment under output 2. \n \nII. Assignment Background \n \n2.  E-government for SNAs. The RGC is implementing a comprehensive decentralization \nde-concentralization (D&D) reform, which aims to empower SNAs, particularly for the district \nmunicipality and khan (DMK) administration, which is being empowered to improve public service \ndelivery.  However,  institutional  capacity  remains  challenging  including  the  delivery  of  e- \ngovernment  services.  To  address  this  issue,  the  RGC  plans  to  introduce  e-government \napplications to improve work efficiency and delivery of services at subnational level. This attempt, \nhowever, faces many challenges including: (i) the lack of strategies for digital government; (ii) \nlimited human and institutional capacity; (iii) lack of impactful e-government applications and \nservices;  (iv) limited broadband internet connectivity with only half of provinces connected to the \nbroadband  fiber-optic  cables;  and  (v)  lack  of  standardized  business  processes  for  digital \ngovernment. \n \n3.  The TA will complement the ongoing and planned ADB funded projects at SNA level. The \nDecentralized Public Service and Financial Management Sector Development Program has been \nimplemented  since  2012  1  and  the  Second  Decentralized  Public  Service  and  Financial \nManagement Sector Development Program, Subprogram 1, is scheduled for approval in 2020,2 to \nimprove public service delivery. ADB is also implementing the Fourth Greater Mekong Subregion \nCorridor Towns Development Project (the 4th GMS CTDP), which also includes the e-government \ncomponent for implementation in 2020.3\n \n \nIII. Assignment Objectives and Scopes \n \n4.  Output 2 is aims to improve the delivery of public and social services using digital \ntechnology in Cambodia. It is critical to strengthen the e-government system at sub-national level \nparticularly the DMKs. This output will specifically (i) conduct a diagnostic study for SNAs in the \n \n \n1  ADB. 2012.
