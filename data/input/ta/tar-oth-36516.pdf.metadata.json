Central Asian  republics (CARs) share natural resources\u2014particularly water that flows \nthrough river basins that stretch over the national boundaries. The largest is the Aral Sea Basin, \nwhich drains 64% of the combined geographical area of five CARs1 through two rivers, the Syr \nDarya and Amu Darya. Over the last 50 years, water that flows into the Aral Sea has been \ndrastically reduced by irrigation and poor water management, causing serious environmental \nand  social  damage.  Water  scarcity,  water-related  conflicts,  and  pollution  pose  serious \nchallenges for the national governments and communities in achieving sustained economic \ngrowth and improved living standards.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  A large part of Central Asia, particularly in the southern steppes, is arid. With average \nannual rainfall ranging between 100 and 200 millimeters per annum, river waters play a crucial \nrole in the economic activity, health, and well being of the people and environment. However, \nunsustainable exploitation of land and water resources during the former Soviet  period, and \npolitical and economic turmoil that followed the independence of CARs, have shattered the \ndelicate balance between the supply of and demand for water in the subregion. In just about 35 \nyears, the Aral Sea\u2014previously the  fourth largest lake in the world\u2014has shrunk by 50%, \naffecting the livelihoods and health of four million people who live around the sea and in the \ndelta areas. Since independence, conflicts have grown between the upper watershed countries \nand the lower riparian countries, especially over the use of the Syr Darya waters (the former \ndesiring hydropower generation in the winter and the latter irrigation of crops in the summer), \nfurther constraining economic cooperation and integration, and creating considerable waste of \nprecious water.2  \n \n3.  In response to the ecological and human health problems of the Aral Sea, the five basin \nstates signed a water treaty  in 1992  and established the Interstate Commission for Water \nCoordination (ICWC). The First Aral Sea Basin Program (ASBP\u20131) was agreed by five CARs in \n1994, and the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS) was established as the highest \nregional governing body,  chaired by the five heads of state in rotation, with its executive \ncommittee as secretariat.3 The ASBP\u20131 was finalized in 1997, and included regional water \nmanagement strategies, information systems, water quality management, wetland restoration, \nwater  and  sanitation,  integrated  land  and  water  management,  operational  water  resource \nmanagement, and capacity building. The Program helped to mobilize loans of over $280 million \n(including $200 million investment projects for water supply and sanitation in the 3 countries in \nthe vicinity of the sea) and nearly $50 million of grant-funded technical assistance (TA). In 2003, \nthe basin countries collectively prepared the Program on Concrete Actions on Improvement of \nEnvironmental and Socio-economic Situation in the Aral Sea Basin for a Period of 2003\u20132010, \nor the Second Aral Basin Program (ASBP\u20132) which composed investment projects and studies \ntotaling $2.5 billion.  \n \n4.  Despite  the  significant  resources  provided  to  the  region  through  the  ASBP\u20131, little \nprogress was achieved in restoring the overall ecosystem and improving livelihood and social \n                                                 \n1  Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. \n2  Continued winter release from the Toktogul reservoir results in 2-3 kilometers of water wasted in the Arnasay \ndepression every year, depriving the Aral Sea of these vital flows. \n3  The brief descriptions of regional water and environment organizations, which fall under the overall umbrella of \nIFAS, are provided in the Supplementary Appendix. ", "2  \nconditions.4 Among  the  key  reasons  for  the  less-than-satisfactory  results  were  the  weak \ninstitutional and legal frameworks for regional cooperation, the lack of political and financial \ncommitments, and ownership by riparian states to regional causes.  \n \n5.  However, some positive developments have occurred. In March 1998, the landmark \nFramework Agreement between the Governments of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic and \nUzbekistan on Syr Darya Basin Water and Energy Resources Use was concluded, allowing \nenergy transfers from and electricity purchases by the downstream states\u2014Kazakhstan and \nUzbekistan\u2014in exchange for the storage of irrigation water by the Kyrgyz Republic. Tajikistan \njointed the agreement later in 1999 allowing similar arrangements for management of the \nKairakkum Reservoir.  This 5-year renewable agreement has served as the basis for annual \nbilateral negotiations for working agreements that establish the timing and amounts of water \nreleases from Toktogul Reservoir as well as compensation for foregone winter hydropower \ngeneration.5 Notable progress has also been made in the management of other transboundary \nriver basins outside the Aral Sea Basin. For example, Kazakhstan and the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina recently reached an agreement on sharing the waters of the Ili River, which terminates in \nKazakhstan\u2019s Lake Balkash, and Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic concluded an agreement \nin 2000 covering the Chui and Talas rivers.6  \n \n6.  In addition, various projects and studies implemented under  the  ASBP\u20131 improved \nunderstanding of the complex water management issues facing the region. Among them, the \nWater and Environment Management Project (WEMP) funded by the Global Environmental \nFacility (GEF) and implemented by the World Bank,  aimed to develop national plans and \nregional strategies for rational use of water resources and salt control. The WEMP provided a \nnumber of useful insights that were meant to lead to a next phase of development and resource \nmanagement actions. These include: (i) there is no urgent need to define new water sharing \nagreements; (ii) he low standard of water management is the main water related problem in the \nBasin; (iii)  rational water use could arrest the worsening problems of land degradation and \naccelerate the recovery of the Aral Sea ecosystem; (iv) most water losses take place on the \nfarm, as there are little incentives to improve on-farm water management, and knowledge and \nresources are lacking;  and (v) interstate cooperation in water management should continue \nthrough strengthening existing organizations, including formal representation of other sectors \nand higher authorities.  The World Bank\u2019s current subregional strategy is based on the findings \nof the WEMP, and consists of 3 closely interrelated pillars of (i) improved irrigation and drainage \nmanagement, (ii) improved management at the level of the individual river basins, and (iii) focus \non particular \"hotspots\" where improved management and consensus on solutions has both \nnational and transboundary benefits. \n \n7.  The activities in the region of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) are relatively recent \n(since 1994) and its assistance in the water resources sector has been focused on individual \ncountries. ADB\u2019s loans and TAs in the water sector typically include promotion of national water \nsector reforms, strengthening of the institutional aspects of water management organizations, \nand rehabilitation of key irrigation infrastructures. Since all ADB-supported water management \nprojects receive their water from the two large rivers of Aral Sea basin, it is recognized that the \n                                                 \n4  Kazakhstan-United Nations Development Programme. 2003. Aral Sea Assessment Report. Almaty. \n5  The agreement\u2019s initial 5-year term is over and the annual bilateral working agreements process has recently \nbroken down. Thus, there is a very urgent need to review and revise the framework agreement. \n6  These agreements are important stepping stones to strengthen the interstate cooperation, but they remain tentative \nand still require considerable additional effort to formalize technical and economic content and accompanying legal \nand institutional arrangements.  ", "  3\nlong-term viability of these projects depends directly on improved management of shared water, \nparticularly on the use of water in a more equitable, efficient, and sustainable manner. \n \n8.  The  long-term  economic,  political,  and  social  stability  is  directly  dependent  on  the \nsustainable management of the subregion\u2019s shared water resources, and reducing tensions \namong riparian states originating from transboundary water disputes, will improve mutual trust \nand create an atmosphere conducive to greater economic and political cooperation among the \nstates. During the Regional Consultative Meeting of Senior Officials of CARs in August 2001 in \nManila, the CAR governments formally requested  ADB\u2019s assistance for subregional water \nmanagement issues. ADB responded to this and other specific requests made by CARs by \nsupporting  high-level  policy  dialogues,  forums,  and  consultations  on  regional  water \nmanagement  issues.7 With  its  emphasis  on  the  country  ownership  and  consensus-based \napproach,  ADB\u2019s  supports  to  promote  regional  cooperation  among  CARs  have  gained \nincreasingly strong support and appreciation in the subregion.  \n \n9.  Clearly, promotion of interstate cooperation for improved management of shared water is \na challenging task. Despite continuing difficulties, CARs invariably recognize the need, and \nrequested ADB\u2019s assistance. The proposed regional technical assistance (TA)8 focuses on \nspecific,  and  practical  targets  where  substantially  positive  progress  has  been  made.  The \nproposed TA has been designed through extensive consultation with governments, civil society, \nand donor agencies that are active the region, including the World Bank, United Nations \nDevelopment Programme, United States Agency for International Development  (USAID) and \nSwiss Development Corporation.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  Goal and Purpose. The overall goal of the TA is to achieve sustainable and efficient \nwater management in the region. The purpose of the TA is to help the CARs strengthen their \ncooperation in the management of shared water resources in the Aral Sea Basin and other \ntransboundary basins. \n \n11.  Outputs. The TA will produce three key outputs (Appendix 1). First, the TA will develop \na working interstate water management mechanism on a selected small river basin to reduce \nthe current barriers to the implementation of collaborative and integrated water management of \ncross-border  rivers.  Specific  criteria  have  been  developed  to  measure  the  progress  and \nperformance of the pilot interstate river basin management body to be supported. Second, the \nTA will  help the CARs to  jointly move forward with concrete steps on selected  high priority \nregional  water  policy  issues,  according  to  specific  performance  indicators,  including  the \nrelevance,  immediate  impacts,  and  extent  of  ownership/participation.  Third,  the  TA  will \nstrengthen  the  capacity  of  key  regional  water  management  institutions  and  their  national \n                                                 \n7  Under RETA 6001 (ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance for the Regional Consultations for the Third World Water \nForum. Manila) and RETA 6031 (ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance for Promoting Effective Water Management \nPolicies and Practices. Manila.), ADB organized several regional workshops and coordination meetings among \nstakeholders, where the key policy, institutional, and technical issues of subregional water management were \ndiscussed. Also, ADB under its TA 6099 (ADB. 2003. Assessment of Subregional Water Resources Management \nIssues in Central Asia. Manila.) conducted a critical assessment of past and ongoing subregional activities and \nidentified ADB\u2019s short- and medium-term operational priorities in regional water management area.  \n8 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 13 June 2003. ", "4  \naffiliates on clearly  defined and agreed mandates, according to the key result areas to be \nachieved through the TA.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  Improving Transboundary Water Management on a Pilot Basis. The TA centers on \ndemonstrating good transboundary basin management practices on a pilot basis. The sites \nchosen  are  the  Chui  and  Talas  river  basins,  located  across  Kazakhstan  and  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic.  The  riparian  countries  intend  to  establish  a  Chui-Talas  joint  rivers  commission \n(CTJRC) during the first quarter of 2004 to manage interstate relations in these matters. Once \nthe CTJRC has been formally established, TA activities will commence to assist the CTJRC to \nbecome fully operational\u2014by helping to develop operational guidelines, a financing plan, and a \nwater rights analysis as a basis for a water allocation policy\u2014as well as other capacity-building \nefforts.  The TA activities will be complemented by parallel planned assistance by the European \nUnion (EU) Technical Assistance for the Commonwealth of Independent States (TACIS). The \nEU TACIS project is expected to be operational before the end of 2003, and will provide  a \nbasinwide water management plan and help  to develop a decision support system for the \nbasins. The framework of coordination with EU TACIS has been developed and agreed upon \n(Appendix 2). During the TA implementation, a steering committee of funding agencies will be \nestablished to coordinate the agencies\u2019 activities. \n \n13.   Facilitating Regional Water Policy Discussions. The TA will also facilitate discussions \namong regional stakeholders and develop (i) consensus on the extension and revision of the \n1998 framework agreement on water and energy use in the Syr Darya basin;9 (ii) shared vision \nabout the need and opportunities for the agriculture and water sector reform policies, particularly \nthose relating to policy options and economic incentives to slow the worsening land degradation, \nincluding  crop  diversification  for  conserving  water  and  reducing  drainage  effluent,  and \nintroduction of low-cost land leveling, irrigation and drainage system rehabilitation; and  (iii) \ncommon understanding about the options available for improved water management, including \ndevelopment of water users\u2019 associations, irrigation cost recovery, and other related legal and \ninstitutional issues.  \n \n14.   TA activities dealing with the review and improvement of the 1998 Syr Darya framework \nagreement will largely be implemented through the Scientific and Information Center (SIC) of \nICWC  (SIC-ICWC)  and  the  Executive  Committee  (EC)  of  IFAS  (EC-IFAS), 10  in  close \ncoordination with other development partners, particularly USAID, whose assistance had led to \nthe initial brokering of the 1998 framework agreement. For the broader sector issues to be \ncovered under (ii) and (iii), the TA will produce a series of technical papers, and conduct \nparticipatory workshops with a wide range of stakeholders(cid:190) including policy makers, water and \nenvironment  ministries,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  farming  communities.  The \nworkshops will clarify the understanding of the alignment between relevant national-level policy \nthrusts  that  are  necessary  to  improve  shared  water  management  in  the  subregion.  In \nundertaking these activities, ADB will mainly play a facilitating role in regional water policy \ndiscussions, with clear understanding that the participating CARs will drive the whole process \nand will also be responsible for the delivery of final output.  \n                                                 \n9 The initial support to revision of 1998 Framework Agreement is being provided by ADB through its TA: 6001: \nRegional Consultations for 3rd World Water Forum, which has been limited to financing of initial preparations, and \nregional consultations to organize regional working group\u2019s meetings. \n10 This will be based on the submission of a proposal to ADB by SIC-ICWC and the EC-IFAS and, if approved, the \nissuance of a letter of agreement covering all terms of the grant and including a detailed terms of reference for the \nactivities of SIC-ICWC and EC-IFAS. ", "  5\n15.  Building Regional Water Management Capacity.  The TA will also strengthen the \ncapacity of regional water management organizations and their national-level affiliates in such \npriority areas as international water rights, negotiation and conflict resolution mechanisms, and \nintegrated water resources management. Special attention will be also given to their capacity for \ncollecting and sharing data and disseminating the relevant information and findings under the \nTA. The corresponding  national bodies in Afghanistan11 will be encouraged  to participate in \nrelevant workshops and meetings held under the TA.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The estimated cost or the TA is $850,000 equivalent. Of this, ADB will provide $700,000 \non a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The governments of participating CARs will \nprovide  counterpart  staff  time  and  resources,  data,  and  documents  to  support  the  TA \nimplementation. These are valued at $150,000 and will be equally shared by participating \nCARs. The detailed cost estimates and a financing plan are given in Appendix 3.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA, with the Agriculture, Environment, and \nNatural  Resources  Division  of  East  and  Central  Asia  Department  responsible  for  all  TA \nactivities. In each participating country, national agriculture and water ministries or agencies, as \nthe case may be, will be implementing agencies, with the heads or deputy heads of the \nministries or agencies in charge of water resources as the focal points. The implementation will \nbe undertaken in close coordination with EC-IFAS, ICWC, and various development partners, in \nparticular, EU TACIS, USAID, and the World Bank. TA activities will be implemented during a \n12-month period, beginning in February 2004.  \n18.  The  TA  will  finance  13  person-months  of  international  and  36  person-months  of \ndomestic consultancy, covering  river  basin  and  water  resources management,  policy  and \ninstitutions, economics, and others.  The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. Given the \nsmall number of international experts and specialized nature of services required, including the \nneed for prior CARs experience and Russian language capability, individual consultants will be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Individual \ndomestic consultants will be engaged by ADB in consultation with the team leader. Special \nshort-term  studies  will  be  commissioned  by  the  team  leader  to  augment  assessments \nconducted under the TA. Equipment and materials to be financed by the TA will be procured by \nthe  consultants  or  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  or  other \nprocedures acceptable to ADB.12 \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis for \nImproved Management of Shared Water Resources in Central Asia, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n                                                 \n11 Including the Ministry of Irrigation, Water Resources and Environment. \n12 Equipment may include computers, software, photocopier, facsimile machine, and multimedia instruments.
