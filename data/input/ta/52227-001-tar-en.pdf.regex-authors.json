INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will facilitate the deployment of solar \nenergy at scale and is a fundamental tool for pursuing the cooperation arrangement under the \ncooperation agreement between the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the International Solar \nAlliance (ISA). This is a regional TA for South Asia and will help ADB\u2019s developing member \ncountries (DMC) in the region achieve Sustainable Development Goal 7.1  \n \n2.  This TA is not listed in the current country operations business plans (COBP) for the \ncountries in South Asia. However, it is consistent with the country partnership strategies and \nresults frameworks for all ADB South Asia DMCs.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The solar radiation received on earth exceeds the total annual global energy consumption \nby a factor of more than 5,000.3 In the context of sustainable development and climate change, \nscaling up solar energy investments is one of the best options when it comes to distributing the \nresource in countries that are energy poor4 in terms of conventional energy. Solar energy is also \nthe most widely distributed resource and is readily available for a broad spectrum of energy      \nend-uses in addition to electricity generation. Solar technologies are mostly modular in nature and \nare well suited to rapid deployment at scale because of their inherent economies of manufacturing \nscale: as manufacturing capacity increases, unit costs decline and affordability to end-users is \nimproved, creating a virtuous cycle of deployment and development. However, many barriers to \nsolar energy development exist, especially in the case of utility-scale solar projects, for instance, \nthe lack of a good pipeline of projects, limited financing and financial instruments, and limited \nsharing of knowledge and best practices. The DMCs also face regulatory and capacity constraints \nin promoting large-scale solar projects.  \n \n4.  ISA\u2019s own capacity strengthening is critical to supporting its member countries.5 The ISA \nmission has multiple objectives consistent with ADB operations and includes the creation of new \nfinancing instruments and facilities to mobilize a $1 trillion investment globally. This investment \nwill deploy 1 terawatt of solar energy systems for a variety of end-uses such as electricity \ngeneration,  water  pumping  and  irrigation,  lighting,  heating  and  cooling,  and  agricultural \nprocessing. ADB is providing technical and financial assistance to solar project development with \na  primary  focus  on  electricity  generation  and  minimal  emphasis  on  other  end-uses.  The \ncooperation with ISA will help expand ADB\u2019s clean energy financing and contribute to meeting \nclimate change financing targets while assisting DMCs in meeting their nationally determined \ncontributions under the Paris climate accord.6 \n \n5.  Pursuant to the cooperation agreement signed in March 2018, ADB and ISA defined three \npillars of support: (i) development of a project pipeline; (ii) identification of financing instruments \n                                                \n1  Sustainable Development Goal 7 refers to access to clean and affordable energy. Sustainable Development Goals.   \n2  The ADB South Asia DMCs are Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. \n3  D. Abbott. 2010. Keeping the Energy Debate Clean: How Do We Supply the World\u2019s Energy Needs? Proceedings \nof the IEEE. 22 December 2009. \n4  Energy poor refers to unavailability and inadequate supply of reliable energy supply.  \n5  ISA is a treaty-based international organization. The Parties to the Framework Agreement on the Establishment of \nthe International Solar Alliance (Framework Agreement) have established the ISA to mobilize more than $1 trillion \ninto solar power by 2030; and accelerate the development and deployment of over 1,000GW of solar generation \ncapacity in member countries to meet energy demands and to bring prosperity, energy security and sustainable \ndevelopment through solar. More information: International Solar Alliance.    \n6  United Nations. The Paris Agreement. \n ", "2 \nto support the scale-up of solar energy investments; and (iii) building of knowledge management \nand capacity. The TA project will initially focus on the South Asia region: Bangladesh, Bhutan, \nIndia, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. ADB and ISA will share experiences and lessons with other \nregions through the Energy Sector Group in the Sustainable Development and Climate Change \nDepartment of ADB. Potential projects will be those using solar energy for electricity generation, \nirrigation, mini-grids, electric vehicle charging, street lighting, refrigeration for health clinics, \namong other applications. All require similar viability assessments covering technical, financial, \neconomic, safeguards, governance, and procurement aspects. ADB and ISA will tailor capacity \nbuilding and policy advice to support the identification of investment opportunities (\u201clearning by \ndoing\u201d) and other activities covered by the cooperation agreement between ADB and ISA. Given \nISA\u2019s limited financial resources, the TA as a whole represents ADB\u2019s value addition. \n \n6.  The envisioned solar applications will contribute to three operational priorities of ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030:7 \n(i)  addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities\u2014solar mini-grids and \nrooftop solar installations;   \n(ii)  tackling climate change and building disaster resilience\u2014large-scale solar parks \nand solar microgrids; and  \n(iii)  making cities more livable: integrated solar photovoltaic for multiple purposes such \nas lighting, cooking, cooling or heating. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: share of solar power in the energy mix \nimproved (linked with nationally determined contributions to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change).8 The TA will have the following outcome: number of potential \nsolar energy projects increased.9 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Solar project pipeline identified and developed. Consistent with the ISA \nobjective of mobilizing a $1 trillion investment in solar energy, the TA will support the identification \nand development of a pipeline of solar energy projects, including electricity generation, irrigation, \nmini-grids, and other end-use applications such as solar thermal for heating and cooling systems \nand solar-powered water production systems. The TA will support solar experts and country \ncoordinators to work with ISA\u2019s national focal points. The TA team will consider developing \ngeographic  information  systems  (GIS)  for  multisector  assessment  and  application  of  solar \ntechnologies in DMCs.10 This output may include grid impact assessments to determine the need \nfor  transmission  capacity  upgrades,  substation  augmentation,  and  other  grid  infrastructure \nupgrades; and similar assessments for other large-scale solar end-use investments. For selected \nprojects that meet country readiness checklists or are at an advanced stage of preparation, the \nTA will support initial technical, economic, financial, procurement, governance, and environmental \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n8  Nationally determined contributions are the efforts of countries to meet the objectives of the Paris climate accord of 2015.  \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n10  ADB created this type of GIS for Central and West Asia DMCs under the regional TA for Enabling Climate Change \nInterventions in Central and West Asia. The GIS system enables rapid assessment of candidate areas for solar \napplications. ADB. Technical Assistance for Enabling Climate Change Interventions in Central and West Asia. \n \n ", "3 \nand  social  safeguard  due  diligence.11 TA  experts  will  incorporate  opportunities  for gender \nmainstreaming into projects to the extent practical, especially those that include solar energy end-\nuse applications (i.e., at the \u201cretail\u201d end of energy supply chains).12  \n \n9.  A key area for ADB\u2212ISA collaboration is improving the bankability of solar projects so that \npublic sector funds leverage commercial investment. An example of bankability improvement is \nthe  national  solar  program  in  Cambodia,  where  ADB  is  supporting  the  development  of  a \n100 megawatt (MW) solar park using a business model pioneered in India. The Government of \nCambodia is taking the lead in securing the land and in paving the way for the necessary grid \nconnection and power offtake arrangements; and will tender the generation assets to the private \nsector for development in two phases, with 30\u221250 MW in phase one. If requested, ADB\u2019s Office \nof Public\u2013Private Partnership may be able to provide support for transaction structuring or provide \ntransaction advisory services to public sector agencies, to support the tendering of the generation \nassets. ADB will help finance the park infrastructure and grid connection through its public \nfinancing window, and ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department may support successful \nbidders in financing the solar photovoltaic assets. The deployment of floating solar power plants \nin existing hydropower reservoirs, which can be developed using the solar parks model, is a \npromising opportunity for the rapid implementation of large-scale projects.    \n \n10.  Output 2: Financing instruments for solar deployment identified and scaled up.  Mobilizing \n$1 trillion for solar energy applications is an unprecedented endeavor. Prior to ISA, no other \ninternational organization ever announced such a target. ISA understands that abundant financial \nresources around the world are potentially available for investment but that the perceived risks of \nsolar projects remain a barrier. In parallel with output 1, this output will explore options for \ninnovative financing at scale, e.g., a common risk mitigation mechanism (CRMM), a global fund \nfor achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7, and a corpus fund for ISA operations.13 Pursuant \nto a feasibility study for CRMM, the World Bank is expected to approve an investment operation \nto mobilize the CRMM in 2019. ADB will identify entry points to the CRMM, and will evaluate \noptions such as direct equity investments, green bonds,14 and cofinancing from specialized funds, \nother  development  partners,  and  commercial  sources  for  investment  in  the  CRMM  and  a \nSustainable Development Goal 7 fund.15  \n \n11.  The TA will also support ISA in facilitating countries\u2019 access to cofinancing options, such \nas the Green Climate Fund country readiness program; climate change insurance mechanisms; \nthe Climate Investment Funds; and institutional investors, including sovereign wealth funds. ADB \nwill support ISA\u2019s interest in using innovative financial technology such as blockchain-based \nsystems, which assist next-generation crowdsourcing as well as the creation of digital funds and \nvirtual banking to facilitate solar investments. Pending demand from ISA member countries, it \nmay be possible for ADB to provide a regional financing facility for multiple countries with similar \n                                                \n11 The ensuing projects will make use of these initial assessments and undertake further due diligence as per the \nrequirements of ADB for technical, financial and economic, and safeguards and climate change, and categorize the \nrisks and impacts of the projects accordingly.  \n12  TA experts will use the ADB Gender Tool Kit: Energy Going Beyond the Meter to serve as guide in identifying the entry points.  \n13 The CRMM is a global financing instrument for macroeconomic risks associated with solar energy development. \n14 A green bond, also referred to as climate bond, is a bond specifically earmarked to be used for climate and \nenvironmental projects. These bonds are typically asset-linked and backed by the issuer's balance sheet.  \n15  ISA has also requested assistance for creating a global solar bank using 21st century financial technology. \n \n ", "4 \nsolar energy projects along the lines of the Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility, which \nADB approved in 2017.16  \n \n12.  Output 3: Knowledge management improved. ADB will support South Asia Regional \nDepartment (SARD) member countries\u2019 participation in knowledge-sharing platforms such as the \nAsia Clean Energy Forum and similar events in and outside the Asia and Pacific regions, with \nemphasis  on  learning  by  doing  integrated  with  outputs  1  and  2.  Output  3  will  support \ndocumentation of best practices for gender mainstreaming in solar energy deployment. Social \nmedia and websites will be the primary mode of knowledge sharing. The TA will also promote \nregional cooperation and integration through knowledge sharing. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nClean Energy Fund17 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and administered by \nADB. The key expenditure items are presented in Appendix 2.  \n \n14.  The governments will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA through the South Asia Energy Division for SARD DMCs in \nclose cooperation with the Energy Sector Group Secretariat in the Sustainable Development and \nClimate Change Department. ADB will select the consultants, organize workshops, and provide \nstaff to act as resource persons in workshops. SARD DMCs have shown interest in participating \nin the TA during the initial consultation; however, no-objection assurance from the respective \nDMC governments will have to be obtained prior to implementing the activities in the country. The \nTA will support the preparation of country-specific work plans in close consultation with ISA and \nits country focal agency after the inception workshop to be held at the start of TA implementation.     \n \n16.
