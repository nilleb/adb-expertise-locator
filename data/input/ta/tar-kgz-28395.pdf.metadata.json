INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of  the Kyrgyz Republic has requested technical assistance (TA) to \nstrengthen the capacity of the  National Bank of the Kygryz Republic (NBKR) to regulate and \nsupervise microfinance institutions (MFIs) and savings and credit unions (SCUs).  The TA aims \nto develop a sound and viable financial system that can provide a range of financial services on \na sustainable basis, particularly in rural areas of the Kyrgyz Republic.   The TA1 will (i) assist the \nnonbank financial institutions (NBFI) supervisory division of NBKR to strengthen its capacity to \neffectively supervise MFIs, and (ii) further develop the capacity of the Financial Company for the \nSupport  and  Development  of  Savings  and  Credit  Unions  (FCCU)  to  carry  out  day-to-day \noversight of SCUs. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Overview of the Microfinance Sector.  The Kyrgyz Republic has made significant \nstrides to promote the development of the microfinance sector to help meet the requirements of \nmicro and small enterprises (MSEs), households, and individuals who have not been well- \nserved by the formal financial system.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has actively \nsupported  this  sector.    In  1996,  through  a  project  preparatory  TA,  the  first  SCUs  were \nsuccessfully piloted in the country.  This led directly to the Rural Finance Institution Project,2 \nwhich began its activities in 1998 and whose purpose is to create a sustainable rural financial \nsystem based on SCUs that can both mobilize savings and increase the supply of credit to \npeople living in rural areas.   \n \n3.  The SCU system has grown dramatically since the inception of the Rural Finance \nProject.  By the end of 1998, 83 SCUs were in operation.  The number grew to 166 by end- \n1999, increasing to 192 in 2000.  By the end of 2001 there were 275 SCUs, and it is estimated \nthat by the end of 2002, the number will be 355.  In the latest annual period alone, the system \ngrew by 29%.  The assets of the SCUs system now represent 4% of total financial sector \nassets.  Approximately 29,000 people are members of SCUs.  The Rural Finance Project set \ntargets for number of SCUs (280) and number of members (28,000) to be achieved by 2005, \nand both have been surpassed. \n \n4.  In the past few years, other microcredit programs have also enjoyed substantial growth.  \nCurrently, 18 MFIs are operating in the Kyrgyz Republic.  Overall, MFIs reach 33,000 customers \n(apart from the SCU's 29,000), generally with average loan sizes less than $2,000 equivalent. \nTwo institutions are worth mentioning:  the Kyrgyz Agricultural Finance Company (KAFC), \nestablished in 1996 with funding from the World Bank; and FINCA Kyrgyzstan, in operation \nsince 1995, and funded by  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development (USAID). \nKAFC's assets alone account for 14% of total financial sector assets, most of which are \nprovided by the Ministry of Finance through various rediscount facilities made available by \nInternational Development Association, International Fund for Agricultural Development, United \nNations Development Programme, and ADB. KAFC is the dominant  agricultural lender, but it \nshould be noted that only a relatively small portion of its loans are micro loans.  FINCA started \nas a nongovernment organization (NGO) credit program but has grown to be the major urban \nMFI in the Kyrgyz Republic.  SCUs and MFIs, which together comprise the microfinance sector, \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in October 2002.   \n2  ADB. 1997. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nKyrgyz Republic for Rural Financial Institutions. Manila.   ", "2 \nplay  a  vital  role  as  virtually  the  only  providers  of  credit  to  MSEs  and  rural  borrowers.  \nSignificantly, not one of these institutions has yet been allowed to accept deposits.   \n \n5.  Legal and Regulatory Framework for the Microfinance Sector. The Government \nenacted the Law on Micro-Finance Organizations in August 2002, which identified three types of \nMFIs:  a microfinance company, similar to a commercial bank, which takes deposits and makes \nloans; a microcredit company, which is a commercial entity that makes loans but may not take \ndeposits; and a microcredit agency, which is noncommercial and makes loans from its own \nfunds. NBKR is responsible for regulating and supervising MFIs under the new law, and it has \ndrafted regulations to govern the first two types of MFIs.3 A separate law covers SCUs in the \nKyrgyz Republic, and NBKR is responsible for regulating SCUs.  At present, the operations of \nSCUs are governed by a set of temporary regulations approved by NBKR prior to the inception \nof the Project. These regulations need to be updated in light of the project experience and \napplied more effectively.   \n \n6.  Supervisory Framework for MFIs. NBKR established a Division for Supervision of \nNBFIs within the Banking Supervision Department in 1997, with authority to supervise SCUs, \nMFIs,  and  also  pawnbrokers  and  foreign  exchange  bureaus.  This  division  has  drafted \nregulations to govern the activities of MFIs (excluding SCUs).  NBKR has determined that only \nmicrofinance companies will be subjected to on-site supervision; microcredit companies and \nagencies will be required to provide periodic reports only. The NBFI division plans to build up \nthe present staff of five to eight in 2003. The division urgently requires assistance to develop its \ncall  report  formats,  software  systems,  procedures  for  on-site  and  off-site  supervisory \nexaminations, as well as staff training in all these areas.   \n \n7.  To support the development of a sustainable SCU system, the Government in 1997 \nestablished FCCU as a special-purpose apex financial institution responsible for financing SCUs \nwith funds provided by the Project. FCCU is wholly owned by NBKR. In addition to acting as a \nfinancial intermediary, FCCU was delegated the responsibility for day-to-day supervision of \nSCUs. Credit union apex institutions are often given such a dual role of financial service \nprovider and supervisor. SCUs are generally small institutions, and the failure of one SCU, or \neven a great number of SCUs, is not likely to put the financial system at risk.  That being the \ncase, financial regulators are not advised to spend scarce resources to closely supervise small \nindividual SCUs. It is considered best practice to establish a strong apex that can provide a \nvariety of services to SCUs and can also carry out the supervision function on behalf of the \nfinancial regulators.  NBKR, however, directly supervises FCCU.   \n \n8.  Under ADB\u2019s Rural Finance Institutions loan (footnote 2), the Government has managed \nto  effectively  promote  SCUs.    The  rapid  growth  in  the  number  of  SCUs,  however,  has \nchallenged FCCU and NBKR to establish an effective oversight regime.  During the period \nJune-October 2002, FCCU found that at least 12 credit unions had engaged in fraudulent \nfinancial activity and malpractices.  FCCU and NBKR submitted an inspection report to the \nGovernment and ADB about these activities. The incidents demonstrate that the rapid growth of \nSCUs has outpaced the capacity of FCCU to monitor and supervise them effectively. The small \nsize of the total SCU system poses no real risk to the financial system.  In any event, the \nfinancial sector remains fragile, and the SCU system itself is in its infancy; widespread failures \nof\u2014or continued incidences of fraud in\u2014SCUs could dampen public enthusiasm for this type of \nfinancial  institution,  and  would  deal  a  further  blow  to  an  already  battered  public  trust  in \n                                                 \n3  Microcredit agencies are not considered to pose a material risk to the financial system and will be left outside the \nNBKR's supervision regime.  This is consistent with best practice in \"risk-based\" banking supervision. ", "    3 \ndepository  financial  institutions.  In  consideration  of  these  issues,  NBKR  and  FCCU  have \nlaunched efforts to consolidate, restructure, and strengthen the system.  \n \n9.  To date the SCUs have not begun deposit mobilization.  So far, ADB under the Project \nhas provided funding to get the system running, plus operational support for FCCU.  SCU \nmember  contributions  or  \u201cshare  capital\u201d  aggregates  to  Som295.2  million  (equivalent  to \napproximately  $3.4  million),  which  represents  50.2%  of  total  SCU  lending.    Most  of  the \nremainder of SCU funding is provided by ADB, $3,765,038.43 to date.  Five years into the \nproject, ADB loan funds remain the sole external source of funding for SCUs.   New regulations \nare needed to promote deposit taking, steer the SCUs away from dependence on external \nsources of funds, and to provide for sufficient capital adequacy.   \n \n10.  FCCU's  Supervision  Capacity.    The  capacity  of  FCCU  to  supervise  SCUs  is \ninadequate.    FCCU  has  neither  adequate  off-site  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems  and \ncapacity, nor on-site auditing systems and capacity.  In the area of off-site supervision, the \nWorld Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU) attempted to introduce the PEARLS4 system of credit \nunion financial analysis, which results in a risk rating system for individual SCUs.  WOCCU\u2019s \nPEARLS system is used widely in the United States and has been adopted by SCUs in many \nother countries. FCCU has not adopted PEARLS due to a combination of lack of capacity and \nlack of a sense of urgency.  There is therefore no financial early warning system in place to flag \npoorly performing SCUs, an absolutely necessary component of off-site supervision.  The \nDeutsche  Gesellschaft  fur  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ)  GmbH/Deutscher \nGenossenschafts-und  Raiffeisenverband  e.V.  (DGRV-German  Cooperative  Bankers \nAssociation) project team supporting FCCU is in the process of developing a modified version of \nPEARLS that can be adopted by SCUs.   Assistance is needed to introduce this risk rating \nsystem and make it fully operational throughout the SCU system; these tasks are to be directed \nby an SCU supervision specialist.   \n \n11.  FCCU's on-site supervision efforts to date have been mainly ad hoc and lack any clear \nmethodology.  FCCU staffing levels in the area of supervision (5 people) are low, and the skills \nand background of the staff are inappropriate to the task of supervising of financial institutions.  \nA major effort needs to be undertaken to hire and to train a sufficient number of qualified \nsupervisors, preferably with auditing backgrounds, so that all SCUs are brought under an \neffective regime of audit and supervision as quickly as possible. FCCU will hire local auditors \nwho, with the proper training, direction, and support systems, can implement an effective \nsupervision regime over the entire SCU system. There is an urgent need at the moment to \nlaunch a kind of rapid assessment effort to ensure that the kinds of fraud that were detected \nearlier this year (2002) in 12 SCUs are not widespread.   \n \n12.  ADB  has  taken  a  leadership  role  in  microfinance  and  rural  finance  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic, but coordinates closely with other aid agencies supporting the sector. The World \nBank, International Finance Corporation, and USAID supported the effort to write a microfinance \nlaw  and  assisted  NBKR  in  preparing  MFI  regulations.  USAID  has  provided  substantial \nassistance to the MFI sector through its support of FINCA Kyrgyzstan and Mercy Corps, both of \nwhich have created substantial microfinance lending organizations. USAID also supports the \nactivities of NBKR's banking division, which regulates commercial banks.  The World Bank, for \nits part, provides substantial support to KAFC, which is engaged mainly in SME lending. \n \n                                                 \n4  PEARLS is the terminology used to represent key classes of ratios related to protection, effective financial \nstructure, asset quality, rates of return and costs, liquidity, and signs of growth. ", "4 \n13.  In the area of assistance to the SCU sector, ADB coordinates all assistance closely with \nGTZ, which has an on-site advisory team5 supporting FCCU.  Originally, consulting services \nunder the ADB project were to be loan-funded, and a TA program was included in the original \nloan proposal.  In 1998, the Government asked GTZ to carry out a TA program with grant funds.  \nSoon after the inception of the project, the promotion of SCUs proceeded more as a political or \nsocial, rather than a financial sector program.  The number of SCUs, therefore, has grown at an \noverly rapid rate, and the resources in GTZ's TA program have proven insufficient to build the \ncapacity needed to ensure that the system grows in a controlled and manageable way.  Some \ndeficiencies, particularly in the area of supervision, are now clearly evident.  The present TA \ndeals  directly  with  these  deficiencies  in  the  SCU  system,  namely  capacity  building  for \nsupervision at FCCU.  Coordination with GTZ on all key TA-related issues is managed by \nfrequent contact between ADB and GTZ. The capacity building agenda that this TA addresses \nwas most recently agreed upon in the November 2002 Project Steering Committee meeting, in \nwhich  both  parties  participated  fully.    GTZ/DGRV  provides  direct  advisory  support  to  the \nmanagement of FCCU.  Soros Foundation Kyrgyzstan provides support for SCU training.   \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n14.  The TA aims to improve the regulatory and supervisory capacity of NBKR and FCCU to \nensure that both SCUs and MFIs are brought under an effective regime of supervision.  The TA \nwill prepare new regulations and develop the institutional capacity of the supervision authorities:  \nFCCU in the case of SCUs, and the NBFI division of NBKR for MFIs. \n \n15.  The TA will \n(i)  review MFI regulations; \n(ii)  create policies, procedures, and systems to support NBKR supervision of MFIs; \n(iii)  implement the new policies, procedures, and systems for MFIs; \n(iv)  provide on-the-job (OTJ) training at NBKR in off- and on-site supervision of MFIs; \n(v)  review, revise, and update the temporary regulations governing SCU operations; \n(vi)  develop policies, procedures, and systems for off- and on-site supervision of SCUs; \n(vii) implement the new policies, procedures, and systems; and \n(viii) provide OTJ training to FCCU staff in off-site and on-site supervision of SCUs.       \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  The expertise required to update the regulations related to SCUs and build capacity to \nsupervise SCUs and MFIs will be delivered by consulting services. Working closely with NBKR, \none consultant will revise and update the SCU regulations. Two consultants will also work with \nNBKR to develop off-site and on-site supervision systems and staff capacity within the NBFI \ndivision.  In the case of FCCU, one consultant will be integrated into FCCU's management team \n                                                 \n5  GTZ has a contract with DGRV to carry out the TA program. Two full-time experts\u2014a project manager, and a \nsenior advisor\u2014provide the bulk of the assistance. The project manager has a small local staff and an office \nadjacent to FCCU.  The senior advisor recently joined the project for a period of 1 year and has an office within \nFCCU.  He works directly with FCCU senior managers. The two individuals, plus local staff, comprise the GTZ \nRural Finance Project Team. GTZ has made a provision for approximately 7 months' additional consulting level of \neffort for short-term technical assistance, which is programmed by the project manager.  At present, they plan to \nuse this assistance to strengthen information technology systems (and have some small amount of additional funds \navailable for equipment) in support of the supervision function at FCCU. ", "    5 \nto develop the supervision function and provide OTJ training and ongoing supervision to the \nnew team of supervisors at FCCU. Each of the international consultants will have different \nreporting requirements. The TA will provide funding for a team of supervisors who will be \nengaged by FCCU and be integrated into FCCU's supervision department, under the direction \nof the international consultant who will oversee the development of the supervision function.  \nThe detailed consultants' terms of reference are in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The estimated cost of the TA is $654,000, comprising $482,000 in foreign exchange and \n$172,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested ADB to finance the \nentire foreign exchange and $68,000 equivalent of the local currency costs. The TA will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB's  TA  funding  program.  Detailed  cost  estimates  and  a \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  NBKR will be the Executing Agency for the TA.  NBKR's NBFI division and FCCU will be \nthe Implementing Agencies. Each Implementing Agency will provide the consultants with the \nnecessary office support, counterpart staff, and transportation. ADB will review and monitor the \nimplementation of the TA through missions and consultant\u2019s reports.  TA activities carried out at \nFCCU will be coordinated with the GTZ Rural Finance Project Team.   \n \n19.  To  implement  the  TA,  ADB  will  select  and  engage  consultants  individually.  Four \ninternational consultants, will serve for a total of 16 person-months. They (16 person-months) \nwill include a savings and credit union regulatory specialist (1), a financial institutions (off-site) \nsupervision specialist (3), a financial institutions supervision (on-site) specialist (3), and a \nsavings and credit union supervision specialist (9). Ten domestic consultants with auditing \nexperience will be engaged for 10 person-months each as SCU supervisor (totaling 100 person \nmonths of domestic consulting services). The consultants will be selected and recruited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The TA is expected to begin in \nJanuary 2003 and to be completed in December 2003.  Relevant reporting requirements for the \nconsultants are outlined in detail in Appendix 2. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance, not exceeding the equivalent of $550,000 on a grant basis, to \nthe Government of the Kyrgyz Republic for Capacity Building in Savings and Credit Unions and \nMicrofinancial Systems, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
