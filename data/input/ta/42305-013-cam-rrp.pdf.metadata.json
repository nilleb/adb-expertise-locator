I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Third Financial Sector Program and (ii) a proposed policy-based \nloan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for subprogram 1 of the Third Financial Sector Program. The \nreport describes proposed Implementing subprogram 2 of the Third Financial Sector Program \ntechnical assistance (TA), and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The development framework for Cambodia\u2019s finance sector is based on a 10-year rolling \nfinance sector development strategy (FSDS) of the government. The 10-year strategy was \nrecently updated  as the FSDS, 2011\u20132020.2  It is aligned with Cambodia\u2019s updated National \nStrategy and Development Plan, 2009\u20132013 and Rectangular Strategy, as well as with the \ncountry  strategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  Cambodia,  2011\u20132013.  It  has \nincorporated the recommendations of the Financial Sector Assessment Program, 2010 of the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  and  the  World  Bank.  Bilateral  meetings  were  held  with  key \nstakeholders and were followed by several workshops with government agencies. Development \npartner coordination was further strengthened during the update of the FSDS. ADB meets \nregularly with all development partners in the finance sector to discuss current issues and \ncoordinate activities. This informal group of development partners periodically discusses finance \nissues with relevant business associations and Cambodia\u2019s Private Sector Forum. As per the \nGovernment  of  Cambodia\u2019s  request,  the  proposed  third  program  is  a  cluster  of  three \nsubprograms to implement the first phase of the FSDS, 2011\u20132020. These reforms have been \ndiscussed  with  all  relevant  government  agencies,  industry  associations,  and  development \npartners. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  A robust finance sector is essential for sustainable economic growth. Cambodia\u2019s real \ngross domestic product (GDP) grew strongly at 9.1% per year on average from 1998 to 2008. \nThis slowed in 2009 and 2010 because of indirect effects of the recent global economic crisis. \nThe authorities nevertheless aim to pursue economic reform that will return the economy to pre-\ncrisis growth rates. The period of robust economic performance was led by the private sector, in \nparticular  garments,  tourist-related  services,  construction,  and  agriculture.  A  substantial \nproportion of these activities  were financed by foreign direct investment and the domestic \nfinance system. With a rapidly growing commercial economy that requires a sound finance \nsystem to sustain growth, the government is committed to the long-term development of the \nfinance sector, channeling financial resources to productive investments, and managing the \ninherent risks to achieve sustainable economic growth over the long term and contribute to \npoverty  reduction.  To  promote  sustainable  economic  growth,  reduce  poverty,  and  mitigate \nshocks emanating from external financial crises, ADB supports finance sector development in \nits developing member countries, including Cambodia. Since 2001, ADB has become the lead \ndevelopment partner supporting Cambodia\u2019s finance sector. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory TA: ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Preparing \nthe Third Financial Sector Program Cluster. Manila ( TA 7520-CAM). ", "2 \n4.  ADB and the government began in 1999 their partnership to develop Cambodia\u2019s then-\nnascent finance sector. External assistance was sorely needed both to lay the groundwork for \nfinance sector development and to rebuild capacity largely decimated during the conflict years. \nFully cognizant of the pivotal role the sector would play in achieving economic transformation, \nand faced with a rapidly growing commercial economy potentially undermined by scarce capital, \nthe government embarked on a long-term development strategy and plan for developing the \ncountry\u2019s  finance  sector.  As  a  first  step,  and  with  ADB  assistance,  the  government \ncommissioned the preparation of the FSDS, 2001\u20132010, which was to guide finance sector \ndevelopment during that period. To help implement the first phase of the FSDS, 2001\u20132010, \nADB approved the $30 million first Financial Sector Program in November 2001.3 Implemented \nfrom 2001 to 2007, the first program enabled the government to begin establishing legal and \nregulatory  foundations,  consolidate  the  banking  system,  establish  key  regulatory  agencies, \nprivatize state-owned banks and finance institutions, and commence the licensing of informal \nmicrofinance institutions (MFIs). \n \n5.  The FSDS, 2001\u20132010 was updated by the FSDS, 2006\u20132015 to take into account new \nchallenges,  both  domestic  and  international,  as  well  as  market  developments.  The  FSDS, \n2006\u20132015 noted encouraging progress in sector development. Encouraging achievements \nunder the first program prompted the government to request further support from ADB to \ncontinue its reform of the finance sector, and ADB approved the $45.3 million Second Financial \nSector Program Cluster in December 2007.4 Implemented from 2007 to 2010, the second \nprogram completed reforms that helped boost confidence in the formal finance sector, advanced \nthe legal and regulatory foundation, strengthened the capacity of regulatory agencies, and \nintroduced part of the supporting infrastructure for financial activities. While Cambodia still has \none of the lowest rates of financial intermediation in the world, it has improved since 2001 with \nthe money supply growing from 13% of GDP in 2001 to 21% in 2006 and 40% in 2010. \n \n6.  As of the end of June 2011, the formal finance sector comprises the National Bank of \nCambodia  (NBC),  29  commercial  banks,  6  specialized  financial  institutions,  and  2 \nrepresentative offices of foreign based banks; 26 licensed MFIs and 29 registered MFIs; 7 \ninsurance companies, 1 insurance broker, and 2 insurance agents; and the Securities and \nExchange Commission of Cambodia (SECC) with 7 securities underwriters, 2 securities dealers, \n4 securities brokers, 2 investment advisers, and 3 cash settlement agents. On 11 July 2011, the \ngovernment launched the Cambodian Securities Exchange, jointly owned by the Ministry of \nEconomy and Finance (MEF) with 55% and the Korea Exchange with 45%, but trading has yet \nto commence. As in most developing countries, the banking system in Cambodia dominates the \nfinance sector. Banking activities are not fully developed but are improving in rural areas, with \nMFIs providing most formal financial services. Microfinance is expanding rapidly, with total credit \nincreasing  from  $35.0  million  in  2001  to  $514.4  million  in  June  2011  and  the  number  of \nborrowers increasing from 410,000 to 1.08 million over the same period. The Financial Industry \nDepartment in the MEF regulates and supervises the insurance subsector, which comprises six \ninsurance companies and one re-insurer, the latter majority owned by the government. Growth \nhas been steady with the premium total reaching $24.9 million in 2010, nearly seven times the \n$3.6 million in 2001. \n \n                                                \n3 ADB. 2001.

Progress has been made on several fronts as positive and progressive \nreforms have been successfully implemented since 2001.5  Major highlights are6 \n(i)  the enactment of key financial and commercial laws to support a sound and \nmarket-driven finance sector, \n(ii)  the rebuilding and strengthening of key financial institutions under the auspices \nof the NBC and the MEF, \n(iii)  the introduction of supporting financial infrastructure to enhance finance market \nactivities and improve outreach to the rural poor, \n(iv)  the rebuilding of human capacity and technical know-how, and \n(v)  the finance sector\u2019s growing role in mobilizing domestic financial resources to \nmeet the demands of a growing economy. \n8.     Sector Challenges. Challenges to further developing the finance sector include low \nfinancial intermediation due to the rural and informal nature of the economy, vulnerability to \nexternal shocks due to a narrow economic base that is heavily dependent on international \nmarkets, governance issues as accounting and auditing practices are being further developed, \nand  inefficiencies due to a financial infrastructure that is not fully developed and corresponding \ntechnical capacity that is weak and needs to be further developed in line with the human \ncapacity requirements of the sector. The third program will continue to address these challenges \nas outlined in the Outputs Section (paras 12-25 below). \n9.  Lessons. In moving to implement the FSDS, 2011\u20132020, past lessons clearly illustrate \nthe following: (i) A set of long-term objectives is required to guide and shape medium-term \npolicy design and implementation. (ii) Flexibility in design is important to accommodate changes \nin economic, social, and political circumstances. (iii) The time lag between the adoption of \nreforms and their effective enforcement needs to be shortened. (iv) Substantial TA resources \nare required to build technical capacity. (v) Maintaining monetary and financial stability are \ncrucial to economic growth. (vi) Promoting good governance, under which financial growth and \ndevelopment is to be pursued, would anchor the FSDS. (vii) Enhancing the sector\u2019s operational \nefficiency  would  facilitate  FSDS  implementation.  The  design  of  the  third  program  has \nincorporated these lessons. \n \n10.  Rebuilding Cambodia\u2019s finance sector. This is a protracted process. While positive \nprogress has been achieved, a large part of the country remains untapped by formal finance, \nas, at the end of 2010, less than 10% of the population had access to credit through the formal \nsector.  The  government  recognizes  that  attaining  inclusive  economic  growth  requires  a \ndiversified,  competitive,  and  prudentially  sound  financial  system  to  ensure  that  financial \nresources are efficiently accumulated and effectively allocated. To implement the FSDS, 2011\u2013\n2020, the government requested ADB\u2019s further support for its finance sector reforms under the \nthird  program.  To  maintain  monetary  and  financial  stability,  the  third  program  will  actively \npromote the use of the local currency (the riel), update the core legal framework for banking and \nfinance, enact additional commercial laws, and strengthen coordination among finance sector \nregulators. Support will be extended toward developing the recently launched securities market \nand operationalizing the money and interbank markets. Capacity building will continue in order \nto meet the increased demand for qualified staff for the growing number of financial institutions \nand their branch networks, as well as to enable existing regulators to shift from compliance- to \nrisk-based  supervision.  Upgrading  supporting  infrastructure,  which  includes  accounting  and \n                                                \n5  Contribution to the ADB Results Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  Summary of Achievements under the first Financial Sector Program and the Second Financial Sector Program \nCluster (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \nauditing, anti-money laundering measures, and a payments system, is a long-term initiative that \nwill continue under the third program (additional details are in section II C). \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The expected impact of the third program is a sound, market-based finance sector able \nto enhance resource mobilization and support sustainable economic growth. The expected \noutcome is a growing, resilient, and efficient financial system. The third program comprises a \nseries  of  three  single-tranche  subprograms  to  be  implemented  from  December  2010  to \nDecember 2013. Subprogram 1 has 20 reform actions, which the government implemented \nbetween December 2010 and October 2011. \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  Third program policy measures include a set of sector reforms to improve the legal and \nregulatory framework and its application, strengthen institutional coordination among national \nregulatory agencies, promote confidence and growth in outreach, strengthen the application of \nsupporting  infrastructure  and  international  standards,  develop  new  markets,  and  support \ncapacity  development  more  sustainably.  The  program  has  four  outputs:  (i)  finance  sector \nstability maintained, (ii) confidence and financial intermediation improved, (iii) good governance \npromoted,  and  (iv)  finance  sector  efficiency  enhanced.  Key  activities  for  each  output  are \ndescribed below. \n \n1.  Finance Sector Stability Maintained \n13.  Legal and regulatory framework for banks and microfinance institutions. As part of \nefforts to maintain financial stability, address the features of a fast-changing domestic market, \nand align it with the reality of closer international economic integration, the NBC is committed to \nupdating the Law on the Organization and Conduct of the NBC, 1996 and the Law on Banking \nand  Financial  Institutions,  1999.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  NBC  organized  workshops  in \ncoordination with the MEF, Ministry of Commerce (MOC), SECC, and stakeholders to identify \nwhich existing laws have overlapping or conflicting provisions. Under subprogram 2, the NBC \nwill update these two laws in consultation with the MEF, MOC, and SECC and incorporate the \nrecommendations of the Financial Sector Assessment Program, 2010. \n \n14.  Bank supervision capacity and financial stability. As part of efforts to strengthen \nprudential supervision under subprogram 1, the NBC has developed a framework for assessing \nfinance sector risks and issued supervisory guidelines to banks, adopted a road map toward \nimproving compliance with core Basel principles for effective bank supervision, and reinforced \ncoordination  between  the  NBC\u2019s  Supervision  Department  and  the  Cambodian  Financial \nIntelligence Unit (CAFIU) to enforce reporting by banks. Subprogram 2 will support (i) the NBC\u2019s \nefforts to strengthen cooperation among local finance sector regulators and with supervision \nauthorities in countries that have subsidiary banks licensed in Cambodia, (ii) its requirement that \nbanks  involved  in  nonbank  activities  provide  consolidated financial  statements,  and (iii)  its \nimplementation of key actions toward full compliance with core Basel principles for effective \nbank supervision. \n \n15.  Prudential supervision and regulations for microfinance institutions. The NBC has \nmade significant progress in building the regulatory framework for licensing and supervising \nregistered MFIs. To improve financial reporting by MFIs, the NBC recently required them to pilot \ntest a microfinance information system that electronically transmits MFIs\u2019 financial reports to the \n ", "5 \nNBC. Under subprogram 1, the NBC fully implemented the microfinance information system and \nensured that all licensed MFIs complied with reporting requirements, to enhance the quality of \noff-site supervision reports. During subprogram 2, the NBC will continue to develop on-site \nsupervision methodologies for effectively supervising microfinance. \n \n16.  Strong  legal  foundation  to  support  financial  and  commercial  transactions.             \nA comprehensive legal framework for commerce and finance must be developed, updated, and \nimplemented to support Cambodia\u2019s financial and commercial activities. Under subprogram 1, \nthe MEF, MOC, Ministry of Justice, and NBC jointly reviewed potential conflicts or overlaps \nbetween existing laws and agreed on necessary revisions. Further, the MOC reviewed the \nutilization of the on-line secured transactions registry. Under subprogram 2, the MEF will submit \nthe draft financial trust law to the Council of Ministers, and the new insurance law to the National \nAssembly. Further, the MOC will obtain guidance from the Council of Ministers on the approach \nfor setting up commercial courts and organize workshops to help increase the utilization of the \nonline secured transactions registry. Activities toward the adoption and implementation of these \nlaws will continue under subprogram 3. \n \n2.  Confidence and Financial Intermediation Improved \n17.  Modern payments, clearance, and settlement system. Modernizing the payments, \nclearance,  and  settlement  system  will  continue.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  NBC  held \ncomprehensive consultations toward preparing a draft law on the national payments system, \nwhich  has  been  reviewed  by  its  management.  Further,  to  ensure  that  the  settlement  and \ntransfer of securities are carried out simultaneously, the SECC has accredited three commercial \nbanks as cash settlement agents for securities transactions. During subprogram 2, the NBC will \nsubmit the draft law on the national payments system to the Council of Ministers; commission \nthe \u201cfull solution\u201d phase of the national payments, clearance, and settlement system to facilitate \nthe timely clearance and settlement of checks nationwide; and procure the shared switch for \nelectronic payments and settlement. Further, the MOC will update the draft e-commerce law in \nclose consultation with NBC. \n \n18.  Consumer  access  to  credit,  customer  protection,  and  market  confidence.            \nThe orderly development and growth of the finance sector to provide wider, more affordable and \nefficient consumer access requires knowledgeable customers and reliable information from \nproviders of financial services. Under subprogram 1, the NBC issued regulations covering the \noperations of the credit bureau of Cambodia to enhance banks\u2019 and MFIs\u2019 compliance with \nreporting  requirements.  During  subprogram  2,  the  NBC  will  assist  the  incorporation  and \nregistration of the privately owned credit bureau. Further, the NBC will, in coordination with the \nCambodian Microfinance Association, organize a study of over-indebtedness and disseminate \nthe results to stakeholders. \n \n19.  Interbank and government securities markets. The development of the interbank and \nmoney markets to facilitate the short-term liquidity needs of commercial banks will continue.       \nIn the absence of traded government securities, the NBC has launched negotiable certificates of \ndeposit,  which  will  be  used  as  collateral  for  short-term  interbank  borrowing.  Under \nsubprogram 1, the NBC encouraged the operation of the interbank market using negotiable \ncertificates of deposit.  During subprogram 2, the MEF will develop capacity, consider the timing \nfor issuance of Treasury bills in riel based on a predetermined borrowing program, and establish \na system for accrediting primary market dealers of government securities, in cooperation with \nthe NBC. \n \n ", "6 \n20.  Domestic securities market. The development of primary and secondary markets for \nequity  securities  will  help  domestic  corporations  to  access  funds  directly  from  investors.          \nThe legal framework for developing a securities market was established during the second \nprogram. Under subprogram 1, the SECC approved the listing rules and established the support \ninfrastructure for a securities market, registered and officially launched the Cambodia Securities \nExchange, designed educational materials, and undertook a campaign to educate investors and \nbuild public awareness across the country. During subprogram 2, the SECC will draft a sub-\ndecree on bankruptcy matters related to the securities market; conduct self-assessment to \nconfirm that securities market operations conform with International Organization of Securities \nCommission core principles; examine the licensing and accreditation of all securities market \nparticipants, including fit and proper tests; establish a customer complaints center in the SECC; \nand develop and implement a capacity-building plan for its staff. \n \n3.  Good Governance Promoted \n21.  International initiatives on anti-money laundering and combating the financing of \nterrorism. The second program commenced activities to implement anti-money laundering and \ncombating  the  financing  of  terrorism  (AML/CFT)  in  Cambodia,  to  support  international \ndeterrence efforts and standard governance principles and build market confidence. Under \nsubprogram 1, the CAFIU addressed the Financial Action Task Force 40+9 recommendations \nfollowing the Mutual Evaluation Report of 2011 and strengthened cooperation with the financial \nintelligence  units  of  neighboring  countries  and  related  international  organizations.  During \nsubprogram 2, the CAFIU will assess the risk facing NBC-supervised institutions and other \nmarket institutions regarding AML/CFT, in coordination with the SECC; develop a national risk-\nassessment framework and strategic implementation plan; and conduct workshops to raise \nawareness of AML/CFT among casinos, nonprofit organizations, and realtors. \n \n22.  Corporate governance and transparency in the finance sector. To build consumer \nconfidence in the sector, formal finance institutions have to be more transparent in how they \nconduct business and consistently implement good governance practices. Under subprogram 1, \nthe SECC developed a framework for implementing a code of corporate governance practices \nfor listed companies. During subprogram 2, the NBC will require banks and MFIs to disclose \nloan terms and conditions according to a uniform framework that will help inform and protect \nclients,  as  well  as  develop  a  program  to  align  accounting  and  prudential  standards  with \ninternational financial reporting standards. Further, the SECC will implement a code of corporate \ngovernance practices for listed companies. \n \n23.  Commercial  dispute  resolution  mechanism.  Work  toward  establishing  a  national \narbitration  center  commenced  during  the  second  program.  In  2011,  two  sets  of  qualifying \nexaminations were held in March and August for the 54 selected arbitrators who, upon passing \nthe examinations, will be registered as qualified arbitrators. Under subprogram 1, the MOC \narranged for the registration of qualified arbitrators and organized the first meeting of members. \nDuring subprogram 2, the MOC will arrange the election of the first board of directors to run the \nnational arbitration center and officially establish and help operationalize the national arbitration \ncenter. \n \n24.  Development of the accounting and auditing profession.  To strengthen and expand \naccounting  and  auditing  capacity,  the  MEF  introduced,  during  the  second  program,  a \ngovernment-funded  scholarship  to  enable  70 recipients  annually to  study  toward  becoming \nmembers of the Kampuchea Institute of Certified Public Accountants and Auditors. Although \nresults have improved since the first 3 years, some challenges remained for the MEF to attend \n ", "7 \nto, including the formulation of course materials covering Cambodian taxation laws, instead of \nUnited Kingdom laws. Under subprogram 1, the MEF provided 35 certified public accountants \nand 35 certified accounting technician scholarships. Selection was on merit, and the MEF will \ncontinue to financially support scholarship holders. During subprogram 2, the MEF will update \nthe Accounting and Auditing Law to reflect international developments and submit it to the \nCouncil of Ministers. The MEF will continue providing financial support to the train-the-trainers \nproject, as these trainers will implement a standardized curriculum at 10 selected universities \nbased on international financial reporting standards. \n \n4.  Finance Sector Efficiency Enhanced \n25.  Updated and modernized business registration system. The MOC corporate registry \nneeds to be reevaluated and expanded to improve the national database of corporate entities \nand make corporate information more accessible to investors, lenders, and the general public. \nUnder subprogram 1, the MOC reviewed current systems to ensure all commercial enterprises \nare registered and will identify areas for improvement. During subprogram 2, the MOC will \nconsolidate the systems of company registration and company data storage for regulatory \npurposes and to improve public access to this information. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n26.  A  total  of  $45  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Fund  resources  has  been \nprogrammed for the third program, which will comprise three subprograms. The size of the \nbudget support program is based on development financing needs for the sector as identified \nduring country programming and strategy formulation, the importance the government attaches \nto the reform program, and the estimated costs of designing and implementing the medium-term \nreform program minus estimated financial support provided by other development partners.7 \nEach successive subprogram will be processed following the successful completion of the \nsubprogram preceding it. The subprogram loan will be disbursed in a single tranche upon \nsatisfactory  completion  of  all  subprogram  triggers  and  following  loan  effectiveness.  The \nproceeds of the program loan will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of ADB's \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.8 \n \n27.  The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to $15 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance subprogram 1 of the third program. The \nloan will have a 24-year term including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Loan proceeds will be used to finance the full \nforeign exchange cost of items produced and procured in ADB member countries.9 ADB will \nretain the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of withdrawal \napplication certification. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n28.  The NBC will be the executing agency, and the MEF, MOC, and SECC will be the \nimplementing agencies for the third program. The finance sector steering committee and the \nTWG, as updated under regulation 393 of 21 June 2011, will oversee the implementation of the \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2011.

The TWG will \nreport to the steering committee, chaired by the governor of the NBC, and will propose concrete \nactions to resolve any issues that arise. A senior officer of the NBC has been appointed as \nprogram director for the third program and will assist ADB in coordinating day-to-day program \nimplementation with the MEF, MOC, NBC, SECC, and other relevant agencies. The program \ndirector will be required to submit quarterly progress reports and an annual report on the \nprogress of subprogram implementation and, in particular, on progress in implementing policy \nactions adopted for the third program. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n29.  In response to the government\u2019s request, ADB has prepared TA to support MEF, MOC, \nNBC, and SECC implementation of key policy triggers of subprogram 2, as well as provide the \ngovernment with timely policy advice on demand. The TA is estimated to cost $1.25 million \nequivalent, of which ADB will provide $1.1 million as a grant ($0.8 million from the Technical \nAssistance Special Fund and $0.3 million from the Cooperation Fund for Regional Trade and \nFinancial Security Initiative), and the MEF, MOC, NBC, and SECC will provide the remaining \n$0.15  million  equivalent  in  the  form  of  office  space,  counterpart  staff,  and  other  support \nfacilities.10 A total of 46 person-months of consulting inputs are required, 38 international and 8 \nnational.  Experience  in  Cambodia  has  shown  firms  to  be  more  expensive  than  individual \nconsultants and unsuccessful in recruiting the right mix of consultants, especially when the \nproject requires a diverse mix of expertise. The diverse nature of expertise required, with each \nindividual consultant reporting to a designated implementing agency to deliver specific and \nindependent  outputs,  calls  for  recruiting  individual  consultants.  ADB  will  engage  individual \nconsultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time), using competitive selection. The NBC will be the executing agency of the TA, \nand the MEF, MOC, and SECC will be the implementing agencies. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n30.  The third program will generate economic gains through the successful implementation \nof medium-term policy actions. The estimated benefits of the program far exceed the loan \namount. ADB estimates the potential annual economic benefits of the cluster program at $125 \nmillion, or 1.0% of GDP, highlighting the importance of finance sector reforms to the economy.11 \nThe estimated costs of policy implementation to the government, statutory agencies, banks, and \nfinancial institutions are conservatively estimated at $59.0 million (compared with $45.0 million \nequivalent for the third program, of which $15.0 million is for subprogram 1). These include \ninvestment,  administrative,  enforcement,  and  fiscal  costs  to  the  government  toward \nimplementing  and  enforcing  the  reforms,  estimated  at  a  minimum  of  $31.5  million.  The \nestimated  policy  implementation  costs  include  investment,  administrative,  and  increased \nbusiness  costs  borne  by  banks  and  financial  institutions  in  complying  with  the  reforms, \nestimated at a minimum of $27.5 million. \n                                                \n10  Implementing Subprogram 2 of the Third Financial Sector Program Technical Assistance (accessible from the list    \n     of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 Summary Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n \nB.  Governance \n31.  The country\u2019s public financial management systems were assessed to better understand \nfiduciary risks and determine appropriate fiduciary arrangements for the third program. The \ngovernment continues to emphasize strengthening the public financial management system, \ninternal  control  systems,  and  the  functions  of  the  National  Audit  Authority,12 which  have \nmitigated the fiduciary risk of the public financial management system as a whole.13 Satisfactory \nprogress has been noted in fiscal revenue collection, with greater use of the banking system to \nstreamline revenue collection and payment processes. Subprogram 1 includes measures to (i) \nimprove the management information system and reporting standards within the NBC, banks, \ninsurance firms, and MFIs; (ii) promote transparency in the information released by banks, \nMFIs, insurance firms, and listed companies; (iii) support the operation of the credit bureau of \nCambodia; and (iv) strengthen the enforcement of AML/CFT regulations.  \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  NBC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  the  government  will  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with \ninternal  procedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practices  for  the  purpose  of \npreventing corruption, money laundering, or the financing of terrorism and covenant with ADB to \nrefrain from engaging in such activities. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n33.  The third program is a general intervention to support sustainable economic growth and \nis expected to reduce poverty indirectly.14 Further, finance sector development extends the \nreach of affordable formal financial services for the poor and rural microenterprises and so \ndirectly  reduces  poverty. While  implementing  finance  sector  reforms  based  on  competitive \nmarket principles has been gender neutral, improvements to the finance sector climate have \nencouraged banks and microfinance institutions to open branches in rural areas and introduce \nproducts and services that are more accessible to women. The NBC reported that lending by \nmicrofinance institutions to women increased from 21% of loans in 2002 to 76% in 2006 and \n81% in June 2011. Females held 68% of deposits in June 2011, and 27% of employees in the \nMFI subsector were female. These results show that subprogram 1 has had gender benefits. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n34.  As the third program will not entail any involuntary resettlement or negatively affect \nindigenous people or the environment, it is category C for involuntary resettlement, impact on \nindigenous people, and impact on the environment. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n35.  The third program assumes continuing political stability and macroeconomic recovery \nfrom the global economic downturn over the medium term. Major risks and mitigating measures \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2008.

With the design safeguards, the \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to far outweigh any costs. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n36.  The  government  and  the  NBC  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  third \nprogram shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the loan document. In addition, the government has given the following \nspecific assurances, which will be incorporated into the loan agreement. The government will      \n(i) implement the policy triggers in accordance with the schedule of policy reforms as described \nin the development policy letter (Appendix 3) and contained in the policy matrix (Appendix 4), as \nwell as ensure the sustainability of the reforms beyond the subprogram 1 period; (ii) continue \nregular  and  timely  policy  dialogue  with  ADB  on  macroeconomic  policies  and  constraints;          \n(iii) keep ADB informed of policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral agencies that \nhave implications for the implementation of subprogram 1, the third program, and the post-\nprogram partnership framework; and (iv) provide ADB with opportunities to comment on any \npolicy proposals. The government will take ADB\u2019s views into consideration before finalizing and \nimplementing any such proposals. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based loan would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n \n(i)  the programmatic approach for the Third Financial Sector Program; and \n \n(ii)  the loan of SDR9,571,000 to the Kingdom of Cambodia for subprogram 1 of the \nThird Financial Sector Program, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds Resources with an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter; a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n4 November 2011 \n                                                \n15  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and   \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nA sound, market-oriented  Total private sector credit of  Annual reports, including  Continuing political \nfinance sector to  banks at 35% of GDP or  audited financial reports of  stability \nenhance the mobilization  above by 2017, up from 29%  banks, insurance firms, and \nMacroeconomic recovery \nof financial resources  in 2010  licensed MFIs \nfrom global economic \n   \nTotal bank deposits at 45% of   Progress reports from NBC  shock \nGDP or above by 2017, up     \nfrom 35% in 2010    Risk \n    Slow recovery from global \nAccess to credit for 15% or  Key financial data from NBC financial and economic \n \nmore of the population by  shocks \n2017, of which at least 60% \nare women (9% of total \npopulation in 2010, of which \nwomen are 59%) \nOutcome      Assumptions \nA growing, resilient, and  Increased of M2 to 45% of  National accounts and  The government remains \nefficient financial system  GDP or above by 2014, up  economic reports and official  committed to reforms and \nfrom 38% in 2010  statistics of the Government  implementing the FSDS, \n  of Cambodia and other  2011\u20132020. \n  international development \nComplementary support \n  agencies \nfrom other development \n   \npartners continues. \nSolvency ratio of banks and  Published audited reports of \nMFIs maintained at above  banks, MFIs, and insurance   \n15% throughout the program  firms Risk \n \nperiod  Systemic risks in the \n  financial system are not \nRatio of nonperforming loans  contained or managed in \nto total loans of banks  a coordinated manner \nmaintained below 10% \n(3% in 2010) \nOutputs \n \n1.
