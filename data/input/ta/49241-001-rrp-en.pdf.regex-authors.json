THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nof up to $175 million (or Indian rupee equivalent) to six special purpose vehicles owned and \ncontrolled  by  Mytrah  Energy  (India)  Limited (MEIL) for  the  Mytrah  Wind  and  Solar  Power \nDevelopment Project in India. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n2.  MEIL  is  one  of  India\u2019s  fastest-growing  independent  power  producers  (IPPs)  from \nrenewable sources, with 580 megawatts (MW) of wind power capacity under operations across \nsix  states  and  an  additional  476  MW  of  wind  power  capacity  under  advanced  stages  of \ndevelopment. In 2015, MEIL ventured into solar power development, and has won bids to \ncollectively install 377 MW of solar photovoltaic capacity. MEIL aims to achieve sustainable \ncompetitiveness  and  de-risking  through (i) grid  parity  tariffs, (ii)  non-reliance  on  subsidies, \n(iii) scalability  to  achieve  utility-scale  operations,  and  (iv)  diversification  by  geography, \nequipment supplier, and technology. \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been supporting the development of renewable \nenergy in India since 2007, when it financed the first set of wind projects under the IPP model \nby Tata Power and China Light and Power. ADB has financed solar IPPs by assisting projects \nunder the National Solar Mission1 and various state policies. In addition, ADB has invested \nequity in renewable energy companies (e.g., ReNew Power Limited, Welspun Renewables \nEnergy  Limited,  and  NSL  Renewable  Power  Private  Limited).  As  part  of  its  commitment \nannounced by ADB in September 20152 to scale up clean energy financing, ADB will seek to \nsustain its private sector activities, particularly in major renewable energy markets such as \nIndia.  ADB\u2019s  initiative  will  actively  support  the  Government  of  India\u2019s  intended  nationally \ndetermined contributions submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange. A key factor of the intended nationally determined contributions is renewable energy \ncapacity addition of 175 gigawatts (GW) by 2022. \n \n2.  Project Design \n \n4.  ADB is proposing a direct loan facility of up to $175 million to a portfolio of special \npurpose vehicles (SPVs or \u201cBorrowers\u201d or \u201cborrowers\u201d) owned by MEIL. ADB\u2019s facility will be \nstructured as a separate loan to each SPV on a project finance (limited recourse) basis. ADB\u2019s \nfacility is being proposed for a tenor of up to 17 years for four SPVs, and 18 years for two SPVs. \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n1  Government  of  India.

The Borrowers and Sponsor \n \n5.  Mytrah  Energy  Limited  (MEL)  is  the  holding  company  of  the  Mytrah  Group.  It  is \nincorporated in Guernsey and was listed on the AIM, the London Stock Exchange\u2019s international \nmarket for emerging companies, in 2010. MEL set up MEIL to be its India holding company. \nMEIL now has 10 operating sites (7 turnkey and 3 self-developed) spread over six states. It \nstarted with turnkey projects as it built itself up by investing in its own wind resource assessment \n(WRA) and project execution teams. It attained the capability of identifying potential wind sites \nsupported by in-house WRA, going through the approval and permitting process, acquiring land, \nand executing the projects. It now has a self-developed pipeline of over 6,000 MW, backed by \nwind data collected through 195 wind masts installed across 11 states. MEIL is the sponsor for \nthe six borrowers. The company\u2019s medium-term business plan is to achieve a renewable energy \ncapacity of 2 GW (1.7 GW from wind and 300 MW from solar) by the end of FY2017.  \n \n6.  Mytrah  Group  was  founded  by  Ravi  Kailas,  who  has  25  years  of  entrepreneurial \nexperience in telecommunications, software, real estate, and infrastructure. Before MEL\u2019s initial \npublic  offering,  Kailas  collaborated  with  British  steel  conglomerate  Caparo  Group,  giving \nchairman and founder Lord Swaraj Paul and his son Angad MEL minority shares in exchange \nfor using the Caparo brand under a licensing agreement. The company was called Caparo \nEnergy  Limited.  After  the  initial  public  offering,  the  name  was  changed  to  Mytrah  Energy \nLimited. At present, the Raksha Trust3 has 57.9% ownership of MEL, followed by  Esrano \nOverseas Ltd, an investment trust belonging to Angad Paul\u2019s family, (14.7%); Capital Research \nGlobal Investments (7.4%); Henderson Global Investors (5.5%); and Moab Capital Partners LLC \n(3.8%).  MEL\u2019s  market capitalization  as  of  22 January  2016  is  approximately  $105  million. \nMEIL\u2019s annual revenue increased from $46.7 million in FY2014 to $66.9 million in FY2015. \nSimilarly, MEIL\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) was \n$59.7 million (EBITDA margin of 89%) in FY2015, up from $40.6 million (EBITDA margin of \n87%) reported in FY2014. \n \n                                                \n3  Jersey-based discretionary trust settled by Ravi Kailas, the chairman and chief executive officer of MEL. \n ", "  3 \n7.  MEL,  through  its  Mauritius-based  subsidiary  Bindu  Vayu  (Mauritius)  Ltd.,  holds  a \nmajority in MEIL. MEIL has raised external funds in the form of nondilutive mezzanine finance, \nincluding convertible preference shares subscribed by the India Infrastructure Fund (managed \nby IDFC Alternatives, a leading infrastructure-focused financial institution in India) in 2011. \nAnother fundraising round involved a nonconvertible debenture of $130 million subscribed by \nAION Capital Partners (an Apollo-managed fund), Goldman Sachs, and Merrill Lynch in 2015. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n1.  Impact \n \n8.  The project's impact will be the diversification of India\u2019s energy mix through the addition \nof renewable energy capacity, helping the country progress toward its clean energy targets.4 To \nachieve  sustainable  long-term  economic  growth,  India  is  promoting  alternative  sources  of \nenergy, such as wind and solar, for power generation. Renewable energy is a secure, reliable, \nand sustainable source of electricity that helps diversify the country\u2019s energy mix, strengthen \nenergy security, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. \n \n9.  The  project  also  contributes  to  the  acceleration  and  expansion  of  private  sector \ninvestment, including foreign direct investment in clean energy infrastructure in India. MEIL sees \nADB\u2019s potential assistance as a key success factor in expanding the company\u2019s renewable \nenergy portfolio. In particular, it is expected that ADB\u2019s assistance will help attract further \ninvestments in India\u2019s renewable energy sector from both within and outside India. \n \n2.  Outcome \n \n10.  The project's outcome is increased renewable energy capacity operated by the private \nsector. The project will generate 1,200 gigawatt-hours of clean energy per annum and will \ncontribute to avoiding 1,185,165 tons of carbon dioxide emissions5 annually from 2018 onward. \n \n3.  Outputs \n \n11.  The project outputs are (i) the development and commissioning of 476 MW of wind \npower and 100 MW of solar power generation capacity by April 2017, and (ii) the creation of \n2,500 contractual jobs during construction and 95 full-time jobs during operations. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n \n12.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.6 It relates to two \nof the five core specializations of the bank: infrastructure and environment. The midterm review \ncalls for investing $2 billion annually in clean energy (including renewable energy). It highlights \nthe key role of the private sector in climate change mitigation and confirms that ADB should \ncontinue to prioritize private sector operations in clean and renewable energy to meet growing \nenergy  demand  in  a  sustainable  manner.  The  project  will  also  contribute  to  the  bank\u2019s \n                                                \n4  The Government of India has revised its renewable targets and now plans to achieve 175 GW of renewable \ncapacity by 2022. \n5  ADB. 2011.

The \nproject is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 for India, which calls for \n\u201cinvestments in renewable energy development.\u201d7 \n \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n \n13.  The project is fully aligned with ADB's Energy Policy.8 The policy states that support for \nrenewable energy projects will be prioritized and broadened. In 2013, ADB doubled its clean \nenergy investment target to $2 billion a year. As part of its stronger commitment to financing \nrenewable energy projects, ADB will increase its assistance to such projects to $6 billion a year \nby 2020. As part of the policy implementation, ADB emphasizes private sector participation as a \ntool to boost energy sector efficiency by introducing competition and more investable resources. \n \n3.  Lessons from Previous Operations \n \n14.  The extended annual reviews of wind and solar projects previously financed by ADB\u2019s \nPrivate Sector Operations Department in India highlighted three key lessons: (i) the importance \nof resource assessment, (ii) the risks associated with land acquisition, and (iii) the need for \nadequate  power  evacuation  facilities.  These  lessons  will  be  taken  into  account  in  the \nimplementation and are part of MEIL\u2019s project-selection process. \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n \n15.  The project is estimated to cost $669.5 million.  \n \nConfidential information deleted. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  Table 5 summarizes the implementation arrangements.9 \n \nTable 5: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  The energy sector in India is regulated. CERC is the central regulator. Individual \nstates have a state ministry of power as well as SERCs. Renewable energy \npolicies are embedded in the framework of the Electricity Act, 2003; the National \nElectricity Policy, 2005 (and as amended thereafter); and the National Tariff Policy, \n2006 (and as amended in December 2010 and thereafter).  \nManagement  Management has demonstrated the ability to execute and efficiently operate wind \npower projects totaling 580 MW. The team is led by chairman Ravi Kailas, who is \nsupported by an experienced team. The company has 223 full-time employees. \nImplementation period  January 2016\u2013April 2017 \nConstruction arrangements    \nType of arrangement  The company executes self-development, turnkey, and hybrid projects. Nipaniya \n  will be implemented on a turnkey basis, while the rest of the projects will be \nimplemented under a self-development model. MEIL will enter into a turbine-\nsupply-and-erection contract with WTG suppliers and into other subcontracts for \nBOP. For the solar projects, MEIL will be the EPC contractor and will execute solar \npanel contracts and enter into various subcontracts for BOP. \nPower generation  Selection of turbines for wind projects depends on the WRA and site characteristics \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2013.

ADB will provide six separate nonrecourse loans totaling $175 million (or Indian rupee \nequivalent) to six SPVs to partly finance about 476 MW of wind and 100 MW of solar projects \nduring 2016\u20132017. The loan tenor will be up to 17 years for four SPVs, and 18 years for two \nSPVs, including a principal grace period of up to 1 year. ADB loans will carry an interest rate as \nwell as other fees as approved by ADB\u2019s Investment Committee. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n25.  The proposed project merits ADB assistance for the following reasons: \n \n(i)  Clean energy development support. ADB assistance will support the Government \nof India\u2019s efforts to develop renewable energy, where the private sector is expected \nto play a major role. Supporting a renewable energy developer with a portfolio of \nprojects through a debt package, as opposed to single-project financing, is a way to \nachieve greater leverage of ADB\u2019s funding and hence greater development impact. \n(ii)  Foreign direct investment support. ADB assistance will support the growth of a \nprofessionally managed renewable energy platform. ADB assistance will facilitate \n$175 million as foreign direct investments in these six SPVs, incorporated in India. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n26.  Confidential information deleted. \n ", "6   \n \n27.

In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory B for environment, B for involuntary resettlement, and B for indigenous peoples. The \nidentified sites are not considered to be along a major fly route for migratory birds and no known \nbat populations exist in their vicinities. Environmental impacts during construction are generally \nsite-specific and reversible. Potential noise and shadow flicker impacts during operations are \nexpected to be within acceptable limits. An environmental and social audit was completed and \nadequate measures to solve outstanding compliance issues were put in place. The potential \nenvironmental and social impacts of the project were identified and effective measures to avoid, \nminimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts are incorporated in the safeguard \nreports and plans. MEIL\u2019s institutional capacity and commitment to manage the project\u2019s social \nand environmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n36.  MEIL will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \nstandards. 10 The borrower will report regularly to ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 compliance \nwith  such  laws  and  (ii)  the  measures  taken.  Information  disclosure  and  consultation  with \naffected people will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.11 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n37.  MEIL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \n38.  During project preparation the integrity due diligence was conducted and significant \nintegrity issues were addressed or disclosed herewith.
