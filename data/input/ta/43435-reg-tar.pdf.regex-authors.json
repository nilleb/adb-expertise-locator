INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  2009  technical  assistance  (TA)  program  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department (RSDD) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) includes a regional \ncapacity development TA project to undertake analytical work on issues related to the facilitation \nof infrastructure investment in Asia. The large need for the efficient formulation and financing of \nurban infrastructure is to be addressed under ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 \n(Strategy 2020)1 and is an important issue for developing member countries (DMCs). Thus, this \nTA project2 responds to both the demands of DMCs and the operational needs of ADB. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Urban economies play a central role in Asia\u2019s economic growth and development. Well-\nmanaged cities act as engines of economic growth, bind national economies with the world \neconomy, and become symbols of national pride. However, such a role depends on the efficient \nprovision  of  infrastructure.  When  infrastructure  conditions  in  urban  areas  are  poor,  cities \nbecome  bottlenecks  to  growth,  hindering  regional  and  global  economic  integration  and \nfrustrating efforts to reduce poverty. Many urban areas also play key service center roles in the \nnational economy, and infrastructure linking them to rural areas plays a vital role in rural poverty \nreduction. \n3.  Financing of this infrastructure is a key constraint to Asia\u2019s economic development and \nprogress in poverty reduction. The scale of funding is beyond governments and development \nassistance. Improved systems for infrastructure finance are required to provide the levels of \ninfrastructure\u2014crucially providing a platform for private sector participation. ADB has identified \ninfrastructure as a key focus of its Strategy 2020. ADB\u2019s urban community of practice has \nidentified financing of urban infrastructure as a key area in its new business development efforts \nsupporting the implementation of Strategy 2020. In support of this area, improved DMC systems \nare needed for providing information on, and attractive finance for, infrastructure projects. An \nimportant tool to enable the DMCs to increase investments for the development of infrastructure \nwill be systems for bringing project sponsors together with investors, both public and private. \nNotable  progress  has  been  achieved  in  developing  such  systems,  financing  infrastructure \nthrough a variety of mechanisms in countries like India and the Republic of Korea, including \nsignificant  use  of  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP).  However,  it  is  important  that  the \ndevelopment of PPP projects is supported by a structured and transparent financing framework \nthat clearly describes the basis for investment in PPP projects. The Republic of Korea has \nsignificant experience in implementing PPP systems for urban infrastructure finance over almost \na decade. This experience, together with other developed country experience, will provide the \nbasis for improved systems in DMCs. \n \n4.  The  main  objective  of  this  project  is  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  DMCs  to  find \nappropriate  financing  for  infrastructure  projects  and  to  strengthen  ADB\u2019s  support  for  such \nactivities  and  its  capacity  to  link  into  such  financing.  The  study  will  assess  existing  PPP \nprocurement frameworks and their applicability to develop and implement an infrastructure \nfinancing platform. The TA will also provide the resources to undertake platform development \nand to roll out the platform to selected DMCs. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 September 2009. \n ", "2  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  ADB\u2019s response to these needs has been to institute a number of activities, including \nthis TA project. The impact of the project will be to enhance private sector investments in \ninfrastructure  projects  through  PPP  approaches,  and  to  provide  a  platform  providing \ninternational visibility to investors in public infrastructure projects at all phases. \n6.  Thus,  in  the  context  of  Strategy  2020,  this  TA  will  contribute  to  the  improved \nmanagement of cities of all sizes in DMCs by developing new mechanisms to finance urban \ninfrastructure including private sector participation, supporting operations departments\u2019 urban \nsector  operations.  By  providing  platform  systems  to  bring  projects  to  ADB  subsovereign \noperations and to link projects to other public and private cofinancing, the project will support \nthe development of ADB\u2019s pipeline. The TA will also improve ADB\u2019s partnership with related \nexperts and institutions in the region, and will demonstrate ADB\u2019s character as a regional \norganization supporting innovation in the sector.  \n7.  The outcomes of the TA will be to enhance the financing possibilities for subsovereign \nand/or PPP infrastructure projects in Asia, particularly in sectors of urban infrastructure projects \nidentified  as  a  priority  under  Strategy  2020  such  as  urban  transport,  solid  waste,  energy \nefficiency, and sustainable wastewater treatment. It will also result in improved knowledge on \nimplementation of PPP investments for DMC urban managers. In addition, the TA will support \nADB\u2019s urban community of practice in strengthening the knowledge of ADB staff in sustainable \nPPP infrastructure provision. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The project uses three components to meet this objective \n \n(i)  Component 1: Review. Conduct a brief review of the salient features of the \nKorean framework for listing and marketing of infrastructure investment and for \ntrading investments in infrastructure projects in selected ADB DMCs, specifically \nIndia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Document the \nframework and experience across case study countries with a view to providing \nthe basis for the design of a model web-based platform to support infrastructure \ninvestment.  \n \n(ii)  Component  2:  Platform  development.  Design  and  construct  web-based \ndatabases  and  applications  for  project  structuring  and  listing,  together  with \nsystems for ADB initiation of subsovereign/PPP projects, incorporating the ability \nto list the various types of greenfield and brownfield projects for use by project \nsponsors and investors collaborating in project structuring. This component will \nalso test the platform framework for India, Pakistan, Thailand, and Viet Nam.3 \n \n(iii)  Component  3:  Workshop(s). Organize one or more workshop(s) for policy-\nmakers from DMCs that (a) disseminates the findings of the study, (b) provides \nthem the platform, and (c) provides the initial listings for selected infrastructure \nprojects. \n                                                 \n3  As yet, country specific activities have not been detailed, but ADB will obtain government \u201cno-objection\u201d prior to \nundertaking activities in a country. \n ", "  3\n9.  The consultants will undertake the required detailed tasks, not limited to, but broadly \noutlined hereunder, to address the scope of work. \n \n(i)  Review investment sourcing and structures under the Republic of Korea\u2019s Private \nParticipation Initiative Act (1999), rules, regulations, annual plans, guidelines, \nand amendments and other relevant experience. Determine information required \nfor  setting  out  procurement  options;  provisions  for  financial/nonfinancial \ngovernment support; and institutional and contractual frameworks for investment, \nconstruction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  project.  Document  this  in  a \nworking paper in a form suitable for translation to system design notes for a web-\nbased trading platform. Hold discussions in the Republic of Korea and other \nAsian countries as appropriate with the representative industry institutions and \nassociations,  beneficiaries,  and  other  industry/citizen  groups  regarding  their \nneeds from the platform. The focal countries were chosen because they have (a) \na framework for PPP in infrastructure projects and some experience therein, (b) \ndedicated PPP agencies to facilitate exchange, and (c) significant potential for \nADB PPP engagement with the country. \n \n(ii)  Design  and  develop  a  web-based  platform  providing  the  project  information \nrequired by potential investors in infrastructure projects, encompassing \n(a)  need for the project and demand for services; \n(b)  various levels of preliminary feasibility assessment\u2014technical feasibility, \nbroad sizing and costing, environmental and social acceptability, financial \nfeasibility, legal and institutional issues, identification of risks; \n(c)  detailed feasibility analysis (value for money test)\u2014analysis of options; \ndetailing of preferred project option; analysis of various issues related to \ntechnical, environmental, social, financial, legal, and institutional aspects; \n(d)  project  structuring  for  private  sector  participation  modality\u2014\nbundling/unbundling project components, project construction, operation \nand  management,  examining  what  is  permissible  within  the \nlegal/administrative context, examining what will be acceptable politically \nand socially, and indicating how the project can be brought to a bankable \nstage; \n(e)  financial modeling and identification and prioritization of financing options; \n(f)  criteria for potential private investors and systems to obtain their feedback \non concerns and to incorporate these before the project is bid out; \n(g)  functions  to  support  systematic  project  risk  assessment\u2014covering \nenvironmental,  social  and  governance,  anti-money  laundering,  climate \nrisk, equator principles, and United Nations Environmental Programme \n(UNDP) responsible investment compliance, etc.;  \n(h)  procedures  adopted  for  bidding  and  procurement  and  awarding  the \nproject; and \n(i)  monitoring and evaluation instruments embedded in the project design to \nensure adequate feedback that can be used to make course corrections \nand mitigation measures. \n10.  The consultants will also assess the information requirements for, and design systems to \nenable, ADB subsovereign lending and other ADB financing modalities, as appropriate, to feed \ninto the platform. They will also assess requirements for the platform to inform ADB operations \ndepartments as to opportunities for funding. \n ", "4  \n11.  The long-term outcome will be to increase ADB finance in the urban sector and improve \nknowledge of best practices both for ADB staff and for our DMC clients. The TA will also \ncomplement ongoing initiatives, such as the Water Financing Program and Energy Efficiency \nInitiative. This will lead to greater efficiency of urban service delivery. RSDD assessments \nbased on Operations Evaluation Department (now the Independent Evaluation Department) \nstudies4 indicate that there is scope to at least double ADB urban sector lending by 2015. It is \nprojected that such an increase in investment would lead to improved services for 200 million \npeople\u2014over half of whom are poor. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000. The TA project will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered \nby ADB. The TA cost estimate and financing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The executing agency for the project will be ADB Sustainable Infrastructure Division \n(RSID), which will directly guide and monitor the project. The Korea Development Institute (KDI) \nis proposed as the partner agency for the systems review component of the TA for the following \nreasons: \n(i)  KDI is an autonomous policy-oriented research organization established by the \nGovernment of the Republic of Korea as an economic think tank on economic \npolicy issues. Through its Public Private Infrastructure Investment Management \nCentre,  KDI  operates  Asia\u2019s  only  web-based  infrastructure  investment  portal \nwhich is the base model platform for this TA. KDI\u2019s hands-on involvement in the \ncontext of sharing the experience of the Republic of Korea will therefore bring the \ninstitutional  learning  that  may  be  difficult  for  other  international  consulting \norganizations to provide. \n(ii)  KDI has significant experience in developing and structuring PPPs. In particular, \nKDI has been providing support to the Korean Government on the system and \nmethodology  related  to  the  review  and  assessment  of  the  adequacy  of  the \nconcession agreements for private investment projects in PPP projects. KDI\u2019s \nwork  also  includes  the  development  of  project-related  guidelines  and  legal \ndocuments on for private investment projects. KDI has developed a significant \ndatabase that can be useful for this project.   \n(iii)  KDI  has  also  been  the  nodal  agency  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  engaged  in \ncapacity development and dissemination of knowledge related to PPPs. It has \norganized many workshops, conferences, and seminars and has networks with \nmany organizations and professionals in other DMCs. It has also implemented an \nADB-funded knowledge development TA.5 \n(iv)  KDI also has indicated it will cofinance the project, contributing its staff inputs.  \n14.  Considering the nature of the project and the funding being sought under the Korea      \ne-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, KDI is considered knowledgeable and well placed to \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2006.

RSDD will engage national consultants required by KDI to \nimplement  this  component,  reimburse  expenses  related  to  activities,  and  oversee \nimplementation. Chosen countries have an agency fostering PPP that will be the principal \ncounterpart and the home of such an infrastructure platform. \u201cOwnership\u201d of the platform by \nthese agencies and the capacity to use will be built under the TA. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months from November 2009 and will require about \n10 person-months of international individual consultants, including an infrastructure finance \nexpert and a securities and exchange platform developer. Implementation will also require about \n15 person-months  of  individual  national  consultants  to  support  review  of  current  practice, \nworkshop(s), and knowledge dissemination. Consultancy assignments will be divided into two \ngroups: one for systems review and one for platform development. Outline terms of reference \nare in Appendix 3. Consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  for  the \nEstablishment of e-Systems in Support of Infrastructure Finance in Asia, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.  \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions  \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nEnhanced private  Significant improvement  Infrastructure investment  Appropriate PPP policy and \nsector investments in  in leveraging public  reports from the DMCs  guidelines are instituted in \ninfrastructure projects  funds to attract private  the DMCs \nthrough PPP  sector investments in \napproaches  infrastructure projects \nthrough PPP \napproaches \nOutcome  Assumptions \nEnhanced institutional  Significant  Baseline data for  Resources to develop and \nand professional  improvement in  infrastructure investment  implement infrastructure \ncapacity of DMCs to  DMCs\u2019 effectiveness  from consultants\u2019 reports  projects are available \nfund subsovereign  in designing   \nand/or PPP  appropriate enabling  Reports from DMCs on  Sustained environment for \ninfrastructure projects  PPP frameworks and  number of PPP projects  PPP projects is created, \ndeveloping  and related investment  requiring cooperation and \ninfrastructure  data  collaboration among \nprojects through PPP  government organizations \napproach  and private companies \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
