Interventions  involve  road  rehabilitation  to  existing \nAssessment  alignments, coastal protection works, water supply schemes, and small-\nscale civil and shelter reconstruction at locations and sites previously or \ncurrently used for the same or similar purposes and unlikely to generate \nany significant environmental impact. All road, coastal, and water supply \nsubprojects will require an initial environmental examination (IEE); all \nother  subprojects  will  be  required  to  complete  and  satisfy  an \nenvironmental checklist during formulation. Category A subprojects will \nnot be financed. \n   \nProject Description  Two  projects  are  presented  together  for  Board  consideration.  The \nTsunami-affected Areas Rebuilding Project (TAARP) contributes to the \nGovernment\u2019s  overall  rebuilding  efforts  following  the  tsunami  in \nDecember 2004. Post-tsunami efforts will focus on rebuilding roads and \nother  coastal-belt  community  infrastructure  and  shelter,  restoring \nlivelihoods, providing coastline protection damaged by the tsunami; and \nfacilitating law and governance measures and safeguards.  \n \nThe  North  East  Community  Restoration  and  Development  Project  II \n(NECORD-II),  programmed  for  2005,  continues  the  Government\u2019s \nrehabilitation program for the conflict-affected areas of the Northern and \nEastern provinces. Post-conflict rehabilitation will address basic needs in \nthe  conflict-affected  areas  through  health,  education,  irrigation, \nagriculture,  community  development,  institutional  infrastructure,  and \nincome-generation subprojects.  \n   \nRationale  On 26 December 2004, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake near Sumatra sent \nseveral  tsunami  waves  that  struck  over  two  thirds  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s \ncoastline and caused catastrophic destruction; more than 31,000 people \nin Sri Lanka died and thousands more are still missing. Another 440,000 \npeople are displaced, with the tsunami-affected population estimated at \nbetween 1 and 2 million, out of a total population of about 19 million.  \n ", "ii \n  Nearly 100,000 houses were destroyed during the tsunami and another \n46,000 were damaged. Infrastructure and fishing industry assets such as \nboats were damaged or lost. About 60% of the damage occurred on the \neast and northeast coasts.  \n \n  A joint tsunami needs assessment, in cooperation with the Government \nand the Task Force for Rebuilding the Nation, was undertaken by ADB, \nthe World Bank, and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, in \nconcert with United Nations agencies. Tsunami-related financing needs \nfor rebuilding are estimated to be approximately $1.5 billion. In the short \nterm, the majority of resources are required for housing, transportation, \ninstitutional  and  community  infrastructure,  livelihood  restoration  for \nfishermen  and  small-scale  farmers,  and  small  and  micro-enterprise \nassistance.  \n \n  The coastal areas of the Northern and Eastern provinces have only \nrecently begun to emerge from the devastating effects of nearly 20 years \nof civil conflict when the tsunami hit. The conflict left over 65,000 dead, \nseveral  times  as  many  people  disabled,  and  nearly  800,000  people \ndisplaced  from  their  homes.  A  large  percentage  of  people  directly \naffected by the conflict still suffer from a lack of basic infrastructure and \nsocial services. A cease-fire agreement signed by the Government and \nthe Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 3 years before the tsunami hit had \nenabled a period of reconciliation and restoration in the North East. \nHowever, many villages and much of the coastal infrastructure that had \nbeen rebuilt after the cease-fire were destroyed by the tsunami. Many \nother assets that had withstood the conflict were lost in the tsunami.  \n \n  After the cease-fire, a comprehensive conflict needs assessment was \npresented  to  the  international  community  at  the  Sri  Lanka \nReconstruction  and  Development  Conference  held  in  Tokyo  in  June \n2003. The needs assessment estimated that about $3 billion would be \nrequired for relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction. Of this $2 billion, \nabout $780 million was identified for immediate needs, and about $1.2 \nbillion was identified for medium-term needs. To date, the international \ncommunity  has  committed  about  $700 million\u2013\u2013to  address  both \nimmediate and medium-term needs. This leaves at least $80 million of \nthe immediate needs unmet.  \n \n  ", "  iii\n  The pre-tsunami conditions and the situation in the North East make it \ndifficult to demarcate tsunami- and conflict-related rebuilding efforts. The \ntsunami needs assessment emphasized the importance of key guiding \nprinciples\u2014such  as  conflict  sensitivity,  subsidiarity,  community \nempowerment,  transparency,  multi-hazard  risk  management,  and \ncoordination  between  stakeholders\u2014during  the  development  of  a \ncomprehensive  recovery  strategy.  The  international  community  has \nresponded generously with pledges of tsunami assistance. However, \nprovision  of  significant  assistance  to  tsunami-affected  people  may \nproduce tensions if it is perceived that different parts of the country or \nethnic groups are receiving more than their fair share of reconstruction \nfunds, or if other people who are in poverty, or internally displaced from \nthe conflict, feel they are being forgotten. By providing assistance at the \nsame time and with a similar delivery framework and policies to both \ntsunami- and conflict-affected areas, the risk of creating a perception of \nunequal  treatment  of  people  affected  by  either  calamity  will  be \nminimized.  \n \n  Recognizing the urgent needs and the social services and infrastructure \nlost as a result of the tsunami and the 20-year conflict, both projects \nhave been processed under ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance \nPolicy.  TAARP  will  complement  and  augment  other  projects  in  the \ntsunami-affected  areas,  benefiting  from  the  current  extensive \ncoordination  mechanisms  established  among  external  parties. \nNECORD-II also coordinates well with other projects planned or ongoing \nin the North East and will reinforce the perception that the international \ncommunity remains involved with and supports the peace process.  The \nProject will also confirm ADB\u2019s leading role in rehabilitation and peace \nbuilding operations in the North East, the country\u2019s most impoverished \nand vulnerable region, which was also hit particularly hard by the effects \nof the tsunami.  \n   \nTAARP   The objective of TAARP is to rapidly improve the living conditions and \nObjectives and  well-being  of  a  significant  number  of  people  in  the  tsunami-affected \nScope  areas  by  restoring  basic  social  infrastructure,  community  and  public \nservices, and livelihoods. TAARP will address the needs of tsunami-\naffected people through numerous subprojects in a variety of sectors \nselected and formulated in response to requests from tsunami-affected \npeople and the Government. Other subprojects will be designed as part \nof the restoration and expansion of ongoing ADB interventions in order \nto  address  tsunami  damage  and  provide  further  environmental \nprotection. Governance, anti-corruption and legal empowerment are also \naddressed.  \n ", "iv \n  TAARP focuses on the highest priority sectors in the tsunami-affected \nareas  for  which  ADB  assistance  is  most  appropriate,  based  on  the \ntsunami  needs  assessments  and  reflecting  consultations  with  the \nGovernment and other stakeholders. TAARP components include road \nrebuilding  and  rehabilitation,  North  East  coastal  community \ndevelopment,  livelihood  restoration,  water  supply  and  sanitation, \nSouthern  Province  reconstruction,  coastal  resources  protection,  and \nNorth East community restoration and development. A legal assistance, \ngovernance,  and  anticorruption  component  will  help  the  Government \nand tsunami-affected people to resolve legal and documentary issues, \nsuch as replacing lost identification cards, titles, and certificates. This \ncomponent will also help the Government to confront the risk of an \nincrease in corruption that may follow the influx of foreign assistance \nfollowing the tsunami and will support decentralized dispute resolution \nfor tsunami victims.  \n   \nTAARP   The estimated total cost is $249.3 million equivalent, inclusive of taxes, \nCost Estimates  duties, and interest during implementation.  \n   \nTAARP   ($ million) \nFinancing Plan    Foreign  Local     \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Total a  % \nAsian Tsunami Fund Grant      150.0  60.2 \nAsian Development Fund Loan \u2013  \n         Portfolio Reallocation   0.3  6.7  7.0  2.8 \nAsian Development Bank      157.0  63.0 \nGovernment of Sri Lanka  0.0  40.9  39.1  15.7 \nEuropean Commission      53.2  21.3 \nTotal      249.3  100.0 \na Grant financing does not distinguish between foreign exchange and local \ncurrency.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n   \nNECORD-II   The  main  objective  of  NECORD-II  is  rapidly  to  improve  the  living \nObjectives and  conditions  and  well-being  of  a  significant  number  of  people  in  the \nScope  conflict-affected  areas  of  the  North  East  by  restoring  basic  social \ninfrastructure,  community  and  public  services,  and  livelihoods. \nNECORD-II will also support and augment Sri Lanka\u2019s rehabilitation and \nrelief efforts underway in the conflict-affected areas.  \n \n  NECORD-II  rehabilitation  subprojects  will  further  community \ndevelopment,  rehabilitate  access  roads,  develop  institutional \ninfrastructure and restore basic infrastructure. Given the recent increase \nin North East construction activity, an HIV/AIDS awareness campaign \nwill be carried out among construction workers and internally displaced \npeople.  \n   \nNECORD-II   The estimated total cost is $55.0 million equivalent, inclusive of taxes, \nCost Estimates  duties, and interest during implementation.  \n  ", "  v\nNECORD-II   ($ million) \nFinancing Plan    Foreign  Local     \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Total  % \n     Asian Development Fund Grant      14.0  25.4 \n     Asian Development Fund Loan  10.6  15.4  26.0  47.3 \nAsian Development Bank      40.0  72.7 \nGovernment of Sri Lanka    9.1  9.1  16.6 \nGovernment of Sweden      5.9  10.7 \nTotal      55.0  100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nNECORD-II   The Government has requested a loan of $26 million and a grant of $14 \nLoan and Grant  million from the ADB Asian Development Fund for the unmet needs of \nAmounts and  the conflict-affected North East. The loans will have a 40-year term, \nTerms  including a grace period of 10 years, with repayment of principal at 2% \nper year for the first 10 years after the grace period and 4% a year \nthereafter. The terms and conditions of the grants will be as set forth in \nthe Financing and Project Agreements presented to the Board.  \n   \nPeriod of  Until 30 June 2009 for both projects \nUtilization   \n   \nImplementation  Both projects will be implemented through project management units \nArrangements  (PMUs) already established under other ongoing loans in the portfolio, \nexcept for the governance component. Each PMU will address a need \naccording to its present strength and area of coverage. The PMUs will \ngenerally be responsible to different executing agencies, according to \nthe existing arrangements of their parent loan projects.  \n \n  A National Project Coordination Committee chaired by the Secretary, \nMinistry of Finance and Planning, will be established to provide oversight \nand coordination. Members will come from the Task Force for Rebuilding \nthe Nation, the Ministry of Justice and Judicial Affairs, the Ministry of \nDefense, other ministries, departments, and agencies responsible for \ntsunami--related  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation,  ADB;  the  chief \nsecretaries of the Southern and North East Provincial Councils; ADB \nproject directors; and others as appropriate. The committee will meet at \nleast  quarterly  and  oversee  overall  project  coordination  and \nimplementation at the national level.  \n \n  To  ensure  beneficiary  participation  during  project  preparation  and \nimplementation, sector subprojects will generally be prepared for and \napproved by a provincial project coordination committee. The North East \nProvincial Council currently performs this function very effectively for \nADB  projects  in  the  North  East.  Consultants  funded  by  technical \nassistance  will  help  to  adopt  this  system  in  the  Southern  Provincial \nCouncil.  \n ", "vi \n  The increased demand for tsunami rebuilding requires that each PMU \nbe  strengthened  if  necessary,  particularly  in  accounting,  to \naccommodate the additional workload. Where a considerable amount of \ninfrastructure work is needed, engineers will be added.  \n   \nProcurement  Procurement under both projects will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement,  and  the  Government\u2019s  tender \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. For civil works contracts with estimated \nvalues greater than $5 million, procurement will be in accordance with \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  For  contracts  with \nestimated  values  of  $5 million  and  below,  procurement  will  be  in \naccordance  with  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB, using single-stage, two-envelope procedures where relevant, and \nbidding periods of at least 21 days. For tsunami-related procurement, \nlocal competitive bidding periods can be reduced to 15 days.  \n \n  Equipment  and  materials  will  be  procured  through  international \ncompetitive bidding when the estimated cost is more than $500,000 \nequivalent, through international shopping when the estimated cost is \nbetween  $300,000  and  $500,000  equivalent,  and  through  local \nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB when the estimated cost is \n$300,000  equivalent  or  less.  Items  costing  less  than  $100,000 \nequivalent may be directly purchased.  \n \n  Most of the investments to be supported by TAARP are expected to \ncome from within Sri Lanka or to involve some procurement from ADB \nmember countries. However, to facilitate the European Commission\u2019s \ncofinance  of  \u20ac40  million  proposed  under  the  road  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction component, Board approval is now being sought to allow \nprocurement in, and procurement of eligible goods and services from, \nmember countries of the European Union, including ADB non-member \ncountries. This would facilitate maximum and expeditious development \nand  catalyze  additional  resources  from  development  partners  in  the \ncurrent post-tsunami emergency circumstance.  \n \n   \n  ", "  vii\nConsulting  The  Government  has  requested  that  consultants  for  tsunami-related \nServices  services be engaged by ADB, in consultation with the Government, and \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of \ninternational  and  domestic  consultants.  Consultants  for  the  road \nrehabilitation and rebuilding component will be selected from existing \nconsultant design firms already engaged in ongoing road sector projects \nin Sri Lanka, subject to satisfactory performance, based on bio-data \nproposals and using the quality and cost based method of selection. \nConsulting design services required for all remaining tsunami-related \ncomponents will be engaged through direct selection, typically through \nan extension of an existing contract. The consultants for NECORD who \nare currently providing procurement and contract management support \nand  training  of  domestic  agencies  will  extend  their  services  through \ndirect selection to cover the additional requirements of the NECORD-\nTsunami and NECORD-II components. Consultants to be placed within \nPMUs will be hired as individuals. TAARP will require approximately 115 \nperson-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  881  person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services.  NECORD-II  will  require \napproximately 200 person-months of domestic consulting services.  \n \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2008 for both projects \nCompletion Date \n   \nProject Benefits  The vast majority of those directly affected by the tsunami were at the \nand Beneficiaries  lower end of the economic scale, partly because the districts affected \ntended to have high levels of poverty at the time of the disaster and \npartly because people who lived in substandard housing were less able \nto resist the onslaught of the waves.  \n \nIn the conflict-affected North East, poverty levels are estimated to be \n60%\u201390%, much higher than in the rest of the country, although there \nare gaps in government surveys for much of the area.  \n \n  Together, the two projects will address urgent needs of approximately \n3 million people, among whom the physically disabled, single heads-of-\nhouseholds, and children feature significantly. By restoring sectors that \nform the backbone of the economy in affected areas, the projects will \nhelp to rebuild communities and stabilize the economic base of the local \npopulations, helping them to move from dependency on government \nsupport towards sustainable livelihoods.  \n \nProactive  HIV/AIDS  awareness  programs  in  NECORD-II  will  be \nundertaken in the rapidly-expanding construction industry in the North \nEast.  Programs  in  NECORD-II  will  also  support  gender  enterprise \ninitiatives in the North East to address the needs of the many conflict \nwidows, reduce their dependency on government support, and secure \nsustainable livelihoods for them.  \n   ", "viii \nAssumptions,  The  designs  of  TAARP  and  NECORD-II  incorporate  safeguards  to \nRisks and  improve and strengthen governance and the institutional capacity of the \nMitigants  executing agencies, the implementing agencies, and the PMUs.  \n \nA possible increase in social tensions and conflict among the major \nethnic groups in the tsunami- and conflict-affected areas is a major risk. \nSuch an increase in tensions and violence could come about as a result \nof  unbalanced  targeting,  and  undermining  implementation  of \nreconstruction.  TAARP  and  NECORD-II  have  been  designed  to \nminimize  this  risk  and will  be  implemented  so  that  balances  among \nethnic groups and regions within all the affected areas are carefully \nmonitored and managed. There will be transparency and community \nownership  of  project  activities.  Both  projects  can  potentially  make  a \npositive contribution to rebuilding key infrastructure and make existing \ninfrastructure more effective in strengthening the socioeconomic fabric of \nthe tsunami- and conflict-affected areas.  \n \n  In responding to the tsunami, Sri Lanka\u2019s financial and human capacities \nare being strained. The volume and scale of tsunami-related foreign \nassistance being provided to Sri Lanka could lead to governance and \ncorruption problems and weaknesses in the administration of justice. \nThe size of public and private contributions to Sri Lanka may exceed the \ncurrent capacity of the Government\u2019s public administration to manage \nthe  funds.  To  address  this  risk,  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  for \nprocurement,  financial  management,  environmental  assessment,  and \nresettlement, supervision and monitoring has been assessed and will be \nfurther enhanced through TAARP. Other factors designed to mitigate \ngovernance  and  corruption  risks  include:  legal  assistance,  detailed \nsubproject selection criteria, transparent implementation and monitoring \nmechanisms, specific financial controls, and regular and random audits. \nADB\u2019s Sri Lanka Resident Mission is also strengthening its capacity to \nsupervise and provide guidance and training to PMUs. A decentralized \nsystem of dispute resolution and grievance review will be established or \nstrengthened  under  TAARP  to  investigate  and  resolve  any  private \ndisputes  or  claims  of  impropriety  against  public  officials  relating  to \ntsunami  assistance.  The  public  will  be  provided  with  information  to \nensure that tsunami-assistance funds are used for intended beneficiaries \nand  purposes  by  publishing  such  information  on  a  web-site  and  in \nSinhala, Tamil and English in government newspapers. \n \n  Finally, reflecting the links between assistance in the North East and \nprogress in the peace process, there is a risk that, if the peace process \nfalters, NECORD-II\u2019s scope and schedule may need to be reviewed. \nDespite  recent  political  and  other  uncertainties,  however,  the \ncommitment to peace remains robust, the peace process remains intact, \nand the cease-fire agreed to in 2002 continues to be observed\u2014this risk \nis therefore assessed to be small.  \n \n   \n \n  ", "ix\n80o00'E 81o30'E\nSRI LANKA\nTSUNAMIAFFECTEDAREAS REBUILDING\nait Kankasanturai PROJECTAND NORTH EAST COMMUNITY\nr\nSt\nRESTORATIONAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II\nalk JJAafFfFnNaAKodikamam\nP\nConflict-affectedAreas\nKILINOCHCHI Tsunami-affectedAreas\nWaterSupplyandsanitationAreas\nKilinochchi\nPalk Bay NationalCapital\nMullaittivu ProvincialCapital\nMULLAITTIVU\nTanniyuttu City/Town\nTalaimannar\nMankulam NationalRoad\n9o00'N NORTHERN VAVUNIYA ProvincialRoad 9o00'N\nPuliyankulam Railway\nMannar\nMANNAR River\nVavuniya DistrictBoundary\nGulf of Mannar ProvincialBoundary\nBoundariesarenotnecessarilyauthoritative.\nHorowupotana Trincomalee\nMuttur\nAnuradhapura TRINCOMALEE\nTambuttegama\nPuttalam Kekirawa Hingurakgoda\nWelikanda Bay of Bengal\nDambulla Polonnaruwa BATTICALOA Valaichchenai\nEASTERN Batticaloa\nChilaw\nKurunegala Matale\nMadampe\nPolgahawela\nKandy\nMawanella Ampara\nNegombo Warakapola\nMinuwangoda Kegalla\nGampola AMPARA\nGampaha\n7o00'N Talawakele NuwaraEliya Badulla 7o00'N\nCOLOMBO Avissawella Welimada\nHatton Bandarawela Monaragala\nMoratuwa\nRatnapura\nWellawaya\nKalutara Pelmadulla Halangoda\nAlutgama\nAmbalangoda Elpitiya\nHikkaduwa Akuressa N\nHambantota\nGalle Matara Tangalle\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nINDIAN OCEAN Kilometers\n80o00'E 81o30'E\n05-1411RM", "I.

A design and monitoring \nframework is presented in Appendix 1a and 1b, respectively, for each proposed project.  \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: ANALYSIS, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Tsunami Impact and Needs Assessment \n \n2.  In the morning of Sunday 26 December 2004, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake off Sumatra \nsent several tsunami waves radiating out into the Bay of Bengal, the Andaman Sea, and the \nIndian  Ocean.  These  waves  struck  over  two  thirds  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  coastline1  and  caused \ncatastrophic destruction and considerable loss of life (see map).  \n \n3.  As of February 2005, official figures indicated that over 31,000 people in Sri Lanka lost \ntheir lives in the tsunami, thousands more remain missing, and over 440,000 were displaced. \nThe tsunami-affected population is between 1 and 2 million people, out of a total population of \nabout 19 million.  \n \n4.  In the wake of the disaster, the Government, as part of its reconstruction plan to address \ntsunami damage, launched a needs assessment and, within days, prepared an inventory of \ndamage and losses. Three task forces were assembled to address the disaster, with the Task \nForce for Rebuilding the Nation (TAFREN), assigned to address reconstruction needs. At a \nmeeting in late December 2004, ADB, the World Bank, and the Japan Bank for International \nCooperation (JBIC), in coordination with the United Nations (UN), assisted the Government to \ndevelop  a  coastal  area  reconstruction  needs  assessment  to  serve  as  a  platform  for  all \ndevelopment partners interested in contributing to this effort.  \n \n5.  The first phase of the needs assessment, conducted with technical assistance from \nADB,2 began in early January 2005. The damage caused by the tsunami was surveyed and \nestimates of the financing requirements for post-tsunami construction were refined. Weekly \nmeetings were held by multilateral and bilateral agencies, UN organizations, nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), and civil society. A preliminary report was presented on 28 January 2005 \n(Appendix 2 contains a summary of the needs assessment findings).  \n \n6.  Tsunami-related  financing  needs  for  national  rebuilding  are  estimated  to  be  over \n$1.5 billion, in addition to the $200 million-$300 million that the Government estimates it has \nalready spent, and excluding further relief expenditures. The fiscal impact of the tsunami will be \nmore long term, given that estimated rebuilding costs will be the equivalent of almost 7% of \nannual gross domestic product.  \n                                                 \n1  Colombo  and  the  10  districts  of  Kalutara,  Galle,  Matara,  Hambantota,  Ampara,  Batticaloa,  Trincomalee, \nKilinochchi, Mullaittivu, and Jaffna were most significantly affected by the tsunami.  \n2  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for Sri Lanka Post-Tsunami \nNeeds Assessment and Preparation for Emergency Assistance Implementation Strategies. Manila. ", "2 \n7.  The  Government  estimates  that  nearly  100,000 houses  were  destroyed  during  the \ntsunami and another 46,000 were damaged. Nearly 170 public schools, 4 universities, and 18 \nvocational and training centers were affected. The health sector suffered not only from damage \nto health-related infrastructure, but also through loss of services and human resources. Coastal \ncourts  and  labor  tribunals,  prisons,  and  police  stations,  and  district  offices  that  contained \npersonal and property documents were partially or completely destroyed.  \n \n8.  About 1,400 kms of the national and provincial road network, and another 1,100 kms of \nlocal and village access roads were damaged. Bridges and culverts were also destroyed or \ndisplaced and embankments were eroded by the advancing and retreating tsunami. Flooding \nbefore and after the tsunami along the east coast further damaged the road network. The \ntsunami destroyed several sections of coastal railway lines, in particular on the Southern Line \nbetween Colombo and Galle along the Southwest coast. Water supply schemes and distribution \nnetworks along the shoreline were impacted, along with at least 12,000 water wells damaged \nmainly by saltwater intrusion; about 50,000 others were abandoned. Salinity contamination of \nstand crops in paddy and other crop fields or home gardens will limit or inhibit crop production \nfor the next 3 to 4 years, until salinity is naturally flushed away through rain.  \n \n9.  The damaged sustained to coastal livelihoods ranges from destroyed fishing boats to \ndamaged informal guesthouses, through the loss of business inventories to the loss of simple \ntools and workshops. About 65% of the nation\u2019s sea fishing boat fleet was either damaged or \ndestroyed. About 3,500 hotel rooms out of about 14,000 rooms in medium to large-scale hotels \nare not in operation. In the small guesthouses, about 1,200 rooms out of a total 4,000 have \nbeen affected.  \n \n10.  The second phase of the tsunami needs assessment process started in February 2005 \nunder the supervision of a steering committee made up of many stakeholders.3 The main \nobjectives of phase II are: (i) to finalize the damage assessment figures by consulting with \nTAFREN and other stakeholders and to arrive at a consensus on reconstruction needs and \nfinancing requirements; and (ii) to develop implementation strategies for responding equitably to \nthe needs of the tsunami-affected communities that will guide all parties engaged in post-\ntsunami  reconstruction.  The  second  phase  will  involve  a  thorough  consultative  process \nconducted in districts by multisectoral teams drawn from TAFREN, the donor community, civil \nsociety, the private sector, and other stakeholders. These strategies will be completed by mid-\nApril 2005.  \n \nB.  Conflict Impact and Needs Assessment \n \n11.  The coastal areas of the Northern and Eastern provinces had only recently begun to \nemerge  from  the  devastating  effects  of  the  nearly  20-year  civil  conflict  between  the \nGovernment\u2019s armed forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) when the tsunami \nhit. The lengthy civil conflict left over 65,000 dead, several times as many people disabled, and \nnearly 800,000 people displaced from their homes. In February 2002, the Government and the \nLTTE signed a cease-fire agreement, thereby beginning a period of reconciliation, restoration, \nand reconstruction. However, a large percentage of people directly affected by the conflict still \nlack basic infrastructure and social services.  \n \n                                                 \n3  The Steering Committee includes ADB, JBIC, United Nations, World Bank, and representatives of bilateral aid \nagencies, civil society, and the private sector. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam were consulted on the \nproposed initiatives, planning directions and document review.  \n  ", "  3\n12.  In early 2003, multilateral agencies operating in Sri Lanka4 undertook a comprehensive \nassessment  of  reconstruction  needs  for  the  conflict-affected  areas,  primarily  in  the  eight \ndistricts5 that make up the North East (see map). The assessment, which was presented to the \ninternational community at the Sri Lanka Reconstruction and Development Conference held in \nTokyo in June 2003,6 identified about $2 billion for immediate and medium-term needs, and \n$1 billion  for  longer-term  needs.  Of  this  $2  billion,  about  $780  million  was  identified  for \nimmediate needs, and about $1.2 billion was identified for medium-term needs. To date, the \ninternational community has committed about $700 million\u2013\u2013to address both immediate and \nmedium-term needs. This leaves at least $80 million of the immediate needs unmet.  \n \nC.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n13.  The tsunami needs assessment emphasized the importance of key guiding principles\u2014\nsuch as conflict sensitivity, subsidiarity, community empowerment, transparency, multi-hazard \nrisk  management,  and  coordination  between  stakeholders\u2014during  the  development  of  a \ncomprehensive  recovery  strategy.  The  guiding  principles,  which  have  been  agreed  by  all \nconcerned parties, are presented in Appendix 3. The international community has responded \ngenerously with pledges of tsunami assistance. However, if not approached and delivered \nsensitively, the provision of this tsunami assistance could risk exacerbating preexisting tensions, \nby creating a perception of unequal treatment of people affected by the conflict.  \n \n14.  In addition to the problems and needs described above (paragraphs 6-9), the destruction \nwrought by the tsunami has generated legal issues for tsunami-affected people, including the \nloss of documents: titles to property; birth, death, and marriage certificates; identification cards; \ncourt  records;  and  bank  account  documents.  They  also  face  family,  custody,  adoption, \ninheritance, insurance, property rights and entitlement issues. The Department of the Registrar \nGeneral (within the Ministry of Public Security, Law and Order) is attempting to reissue birth, \ndeath and marriage certificates, and the Department of the Registration of Persons (within the \nMinistry of Public Security, Law and Order), is attempting to issue identification cards to all \ntsunami-affected  persons.  To  the  extent  copies  of  documents  remain,  record-keeping  and \nretrieval  in  these  departments  is  currently  manually  done,  making  it  almost  impossible  to \nrespond to some requests for replacement documents. Data collection from tsunami victims has \nnot  been  coordinated  amongst  departments.  Additionally,  divisional  and  district  level \ngovernment officials (district secretaries, divisional secretaries, and grama niladhari7) will need \nto  understand  the  new  legal  requirements,  and  document  processing  procedures  and  to \nproceed  along  appropriate  channels.  They  will  need  legal  assistance  to  resolve  any  legal \nquestions that may arise. In the tsunami-affected areas, already poor and vulnerable people will \nhave difficulty negotiating formal avenues, and clearly need assistance if they are to benefit \nfrom the new laws and procedures. In addition, the legal and factual issues generated by the \ntsunami are likely to lead to increased disputes and grievances, both among tsunami-affected \npeople, and possibly against government officers and departments. The volume and scale of all \ntsunami-assistance provided to Sri Lanka could also lead to corruption. Current institutional \nstructures may not be sufficient.  \n \n                                                 \n4  United Nations organizations, World Bank, and ADB.  \n5  Districts of Ampara, Batticaloa, Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Mullaittivu, Trincomalee, Vavuniya. Of these, only \nMannar and Vavuniya were not significantly affected by the tsunami.  \n6  Government of Sri Lanka, ADB, United Nations, and World Bank. 2003.

The extent of debris, waste material, and rubble requiring disposal will lead to significant \ndisposal  costs.  The  dumping  of  debris  in  inappropriate  locations  must  be  addressed \nimmediately to prevent long-term problems of flood control, waterway blockages, contamination \nof the groundwater table, and pollution on beaches, for example by using debris as construction \nmaterial when possible.  \n \n16.  Because of Sri Lanka\u2019s vulnerability to global warming, climate change, sea level rise, \nand extreme weather events, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and other \ndevelopment partners are currently conducting environmental assessments of the devastation \ncaused by the tsunami. Their objective is to identify follow-on projects and further studies in the \nlikelihood of similar or localized natural disasters in the future, including the role of natural \nresources in minimizing the effect of natural disasters. As a result of the assessment by UNEP \nand its partners, tsunami reconstruction subprojects need to identify ways to (i) respond to the \nvulnerability of coastal populations to such disasters; (ii) prevent or reduce the magnitude of \nsuch  disasters;  (iii) educate  coastal  populations  on  disaster  preparedness  and  mitigation; \n(iv) improve  information  and  communication  systems;  and  (v) enhance  coastal  protection \nthrough natural barriers such as green zones or green belts of forests, coastal vegetation, or \nmangroves.  \n \n17.  Both disasters have radically transformed gender roles. Women face the burden of \ncaring and providing for the family, while contributing to community life in welfare centers or \nrefugee camps. Conflict-related disability, often of males, has placed additional burdens on \nwomen and other family members. Family and household structures have been recast, with \nmany families forming one household, households headed by one person (female and male), or \nfamilies composed of grandparents and grandchildren. The conflict left many widows who took \non the role of head of household, combining the traditional roles of breadwinner and caregiver. \nThe tsunami has reversed this trend and left a large number of households headed by men. \n \nD.  Lessons Learned  \n \n18.  ADB has considerable experience in implementing emergency reconstruction through its \nongoing  projects  in  conflict-affected  areas.  These  projects  have  been  recognized  for  their \n(i) preparedness  to  respond  quickly  and  flexibly;  (ii) a  bottom-up  approach  to  subproject \nselection; (iii) balanced treatment of sectors, geographic areas, and ethnic groups; (iv) a focus \non restoring facilities; (v) prompt supervision by ADB during implementation, as the projects \nplace a heavy burden on executing and implementing agency staff; (vi) rapid action by the \nGovernment; and (vii) close donor coordination.  \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s experience has yielded the following lessons: (i) participation by all sections of \naffected  communities,  including  consultative  processes  and  social  mobilization,  needs \nassessments,  and  participatory  planning,  must  be  ensured  during  project  preparation  and \nimplementation; (ii) the particular needs of women, households headed by one person, the \nelderly, and the disabled must be addressed; (iii) environmental and social aspects should be \nconsidered during project implementation, even though the need for rapid response may not \npermit detailed treatment of these issues before assistance is approved; (iv) arrangements for \ndisbursements should give prompt and uncomplicated access to funds; (v) a focus on physical \ninfrastructure alone reduces project benefits, so broader issues of assisting communities and \naffected areas to regain a productive life must be addressed; (vi) flexibility should be shown \nduring implementation; (vii) there should be simple prioritization in subproject selection and \nshort implementation periods, but there must also be a balanced distribution of benefits among \ncommunities  and  affected  areas;  (viii) close  and  frequent  monitoring  is  needed  to  ensure \n  ", "  5\ntransparency  and  facilitate  implementation;  and  (ix) the  large  number  of  Government  and \nexternally-assisted rehabilitation programs in the affected areas must be properly coordinated at \nthe local level. These lessons, learned in the conflict-affected areas, will be relevant to tsunami-\naffected areas.  \n \nE.  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s Strategy  \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s disaster policy8 emphasizes a holistic and systematic approach to disaster and \nemergency assistance that extends beyond mere reconstruction to rehabilitation. It stresses \nstrengthening or rebuilding institutions, developing appropriate policies, and training. Strategies \nfor  short-term  rehabilitation  are  designed  to  lay  the  foundation  for  medium  and  long-term \ndevelopment. The disaster policy prioritizes strengthening of partnerships and efficient use of \nresources. In light of the need for an expeditious and transparent response, it also calls for \nextensive  participation  and  consultation,  and  measures  that  promote  transparency  and \naccountability, such as increased supervision and monitoring and special audits. It advocates \nemergency assistance loans to provide short-term assistance for efforts to rehabilitate priority \ninfrastructure, revitalize social services, regenerate livelihoods, and provide transitional safety-\nnet support.9  \n \n21.  In response to the special circumstances surrounding the developing member countries \n(DMCs) affected by the tsunami, ADB established an Asian Tsunami Fund (ATF)10 to channel \nresources from ADB and other donors to the affected DMCs. The ATF will channel emergency \ngrant financing promptly and effectively to tsunami-related reconstruction and rehabilitation and \nassociated development activities. The ATF will be used exclusively to restore services promptly \nto affected populations in the tsunami-affected DMCs that have requested ADB assistance: \nIndia, Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand. In a letter to ADB dated 17 February 2005, \nthe Government of Sri Lanka requested grant assistance to address its reconstruction needs as \na result of the tsunami disaster.  \n \n22.  The country strategy and program update for Sri Lanka, 2005\u20132006,11 supports the \nGovernment's efforts to rehabilitate and reconstruct conflict-affected areas through the North \nEast Community Restoration and Development Project II (NECORD-II). The Asian Development \nFund IX (ADF IX) replenishment includes a new grant program that, inter alia, can be used to \nassist countries recovering from conflict as they make the transition to peace and stability. \nNECORD-II was programmed to receive ADF grant funding together with a loan for use in \nrehabilitation efforts in the conflict-affected North East.  \n \n23.  The pre-tsunami conditions in the North East make it difficult to demarcate tsunami- and \nconflict-related  rebuilding  efforts.  ADB  assistance  for  post-tsunami  reconstruction  and \nNECORD-II will therefore be implemented simultaneously. This has been done to (i) apply the \nsame  policies  and  standards  to  tsunami-  and  conflict-affected  people,  to  avoid  generating \nadditional tensions or perceptions of unequal treatment; (ii) coordinate reconstruction activities; \nand (iii) link rehabilitation and reconstruction needs. The projects also provide a systematic \napproach to the conflict in the North East and the tsunami disaster by taking a decentralized \napproach and providing for rehabilitation of infrastructure, as well as coastal vulnerability, the \nrisk of corruption and weak governance, gender, and social issues.  \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2004.

At the request of the Government and to maintain clear accountability, two separate \nfinancing agreements will be signed for the two projects, and separate accounts will be held for \nthe various activities and funding sources. With this project and accounting separation, tsunami \ngrant funds can be clearly and accurately controlled so they are dedicated solely to tsunami-\nrelated activities. Similarly, ADF IX grant funds will be used only for reconstruction efforts in the \nconflict-affected North East.  \n \nF.  Donor Coordination \n \n25.  TAARP has been designed to be a part of a well-coordinated response to the disaster. \nThe tsunami needs assessment carried out in January 2005, which is consistent with the needs \nassessment prepared by the Government and other studies developed for districts in the North \nEast,12  was  used  to  determine  specific  interventions,  following  consultations  with  the \nGovernment  and  other  development  partners.  Given  the  many  expressions  of  interest  in \nsupporting reconstruction in education, health, power, temporary shelter, risk management, and \ncapacity building for future disasters, ADB has focused on roads, community infrastructure and \nshelter, restoring livelihoods, coastal protection, and governance. Within these sectors, ADB is \ncoordinating with its partners; for example, in the area of livelihood restoration, the World Bank \nis supporting cash grants and \u201ccash for work\u201d programs in cooperation with the International \nLabour Organization, JBIC is providing a loan for the development of small and medium-sized \nenterprises, and ADB has extended a microfinance and microcredit facility. In addition, as a co-\nchair of the needs assessment exercise, ADB has strongly promoted the adoption of common \nstandards and policies that all external development partners should adopt in designing their \ninterventions, in order to minimize potential for conflict and social tension. The role of the \nvarious partners in each sector is shown in Appendix 4.  \n \n26.  Separate  assistance  grants  from  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  are  being \nprocessed to provide a total of $4 million to Sri Lanka to restore and create line drainage \nsystems along tsunami-affected roads and to provide microfinance opportunity for post-tsunami \nutility connections at newly-built or repaired houses. Outreach programs will provide information \nto affected people on microfinance opportunities. These programs will be independent from, but \ncomplementary to, the projects described in this paper; separate Board approval will be sought \nfor these assistance grants.  \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TSUNAMI-AFFECTED AREAS REBUILDING PROJECT \n \nA.  Objective \n \n27.  The objective of the Tsunami-affected Areas Rebuilding Project (TAARP) is to rapidly \nimprove the living conditions and well-being of a significant number of people in tsunami-\naffected areas by restoring basic social infrastructure, community and public services, and \nlivelihoods in these areas.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n28.  TAARP will address the needs of the tsunami-affected people through subprojects in a \nvariety of sectors formulated in response to requests from tsunami-affected persons and the \n                                                 \n12  After the ongoing process of reconciling the three, it is expected that a commonly agreed national coastal \nreconstruction plan will emerge.  \n  ", "  7\nGovernment or as logical extensions of current ADB interventions, to address tsunami damage \nand provide further environmental protection. All new construction will be in accordance with \nGovernment regulations and guidelines for tsunami reconstruction. A detailed breakdown of \ncomponent activities and sector subproject selection criteria is presented in Appendix 5a. An \noverview of the subproject selection process is presented in Appendix 6. Governance, anti-\ncorruption and legal empowerment are also addressed. \n \n1.  Component A: Legal Assistance, Governance and Anticorruption  \n \n29.  The destruction wrought by the tsunami has generated legal and documentary issues for \ntsunami-affected  people  and  the  Government,  and  the  generous  contributions  of  foreign \nassistance have raised potential governance and corruption issues for the government.  The \nLegal Assistance, Governance and Anticorruption Component seeks to address these issues. It \nwill  provide  legal  assistance  to  tsunami-affected  victims  to  help  them  address  legal  and \ndocumentary issues arising from the tsunami. It will also establish a decentralized mechanism \nfor tsunami victims for private dispute resolution and grievance review against public officials. \nThree proposals for achieving this end are currently under discussion with the government, and \nit is most likely to involve a combination of these mechanisms. They are establishing (a) tsunami \nmediation boards to address tsunami related disputes and grievances, based on existing and \nworking statutory mediation boards; (b) a decentralized office of tsunami ombudsmen, or an \nextension of the work of the existing Ombudsmen to deal with grievances against public officials \nrelating to the tsunami; and/or (c) establishing a unit within the administrative division of Sri \nLanka\u2019s Bribery and Corruption Commission, to concentrate on detecting, investigating, and \notherwise responding to corruption in tsunami-assistance. In addition, training and awareness \nworkshops will be conducted for judges, magistrates, district officials, and the public on the \npotential tsunami or disaster emergency related legal issues, disputes or cases that are likely to \narise. This will include the tsunami legislative framework that is currently under consideration for \nmaking special provision for persons and property affected by the tsunami.  \n \n30.  The  replacement  of  birth,  death,  and  marriage  certificates,  and  property  titles,  and \nidentification  cards  will  be  supported.  Methods  used  for  replacing  documents  will  include \nsupporting the collection and coordination of data by the relevant departments and offices, and \nthrough  modernizing  computer  collection  of  such  data;  transforming  manual  central  record \nkeeping  at  the  Registrar  General\u2019s  department  and  the  Department  of  the  Registration  of \nPersons into computerized record keeping, and facilitating the connectivity, coordination and \nnetworking of such information. This will facilitate location of records lost by tsunami victims, \nand hence the reissue of relevant certificates and cards. In the process of data collection, \ntsunami  victim  identity  cards  will  be  provided  so  as  to  reduce  the  extent  false  claims  for \nassistance can be made. TAARP will also support transparency of tsunami and emergency \nassistance, through the Office of the President by supporting the publication in Sinhala, Tamil, \nand English, on the internet and in government newspapers, of (i) modes of tsunami assistance \nfrom  development  partners  and  NGOs,  (ii)  contract  and  procurement  details  in  relation  to \ntsunami-assistance, (iii) any proposed laws, bills, or policy relating to tsunami assistance, and \n(iv) Sri Lanka\u2019s assistance to tsunami-affected people.  \n \n31. Finally, the MOFP will be assisted to ensure good governance in NGO provision of tsunami \nassistance by supporting the development of guidelines or regulations on NGO governance, \naccountability,  transparency,  and  registration  in  the  provision  of  tsunami  assistance.  An \nextensive description of these components is provided in Appendix 7.  \n ", "8 \n2.  Component B: North East Coastal Community Development \n \n32.  Coastal  communities  in  the  districts  of  Jaffna,  Mullaittivu,  Kilinochchi,  Trincomalee, \nBatticaloa  and  Ampara  that  were  affected  by  the  tsunami  will  receive  support  under  this \ncomponent. Communities that have been affected by the tsunami in terms of loss of life, \ndestruction of assets, and disruption of livelihoods will be identified for support. Communities\u2014\ni.e.,  Grama  Niladhari  divisions  (footnote 7)\u2014that  meet  the  criteria  will  receive  support  for: \n(i) construction of small-scale community infrastructure; (ii) livelihood development activities; \nand  (iii) community  development  planning  and  coordination  at  the  local  authority  level.  In \naddition, this component will support restoration and sustainable management of natural habitat \ndamaged during the tsunami and support coastal resource planning and management at district \nand provincial levels.  \n \n33.  Infrastructure.  Small-scale  community  infrastructure  could  include  minor  roads, \nculverts,  drains,  small-scale  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  simple  solid  waste \nmanagement  schemes,  community  buildings  and  market  and/or  auction  halls.  Livelihood \nsupport interventions will consist of advisory services to identify and develop suitable livelihood \noptions (including small enterprises), skills development, and transfer of technology. These \nadvisory  services  will  be  linked  with  microcredit  provided  under  component  G.  All  these \nactivities will need to be coordinated at the local authority level, so support for such coordination \nand planning will be provided under this component.  \n \n34.  Coastal  Zone  Planning.  The  tsunami  highlighted  the  importance  of  coastal  zone \nplanning in averting or at least reducing the impact of natural disasters. TAARP will support \ncoastal zone planning that takes into account existing natural habitats and land use patterns. \nThe planning process will be participatory, with coordination at division, district, and provincial \nlevels, and eventual integration with the National Coastal Zone Management Plan.  \n \n35.  Natural  Resources.  Restoration  of  degraded  or  destroyed  natural  habitats  will  be \nundertaken through a community-based process. TAARP will support restoration of such areas \nand concurrently develop livelihood or supplementary income generating activities that will \nbenefit  adjacent  communities  and  thereby  ensure  sustainable  management  of  the  natural \nhabitat.  \n \n3.  Component C: Road Rehabilitation and Reconstruction \n \n36.  National  Roads.  Subprojects  will  rehabilitate,  reconstruct,  or  improve  road  links \ndamaged by the tsunami and improve the transport network overall. Among other benefits, this \nwill improve the response to disasters. Access along tsunami-affected coastal roads has been \nrestored, albeit through temporary repairs. However, the road resurfacing and embankment \nrestorations that have been carried out are not anticipated to last beyond the next monsoon \nseason. Tsunami-affected roads will be rebuilt according to national standards for each class of \nroad. Road works will include reconstruction of previously-surfaced roads and drainage, location \nand  removal  of  mines  and  unexploded  ordnance,  repair  or  replacement  of  bridges  as \nnecessary, and a review of \u201cblack-spot\u201d or accident-prone areas so safety improvements can be \nincorporated into civil works. Road works will be designed to improve roads and make them \nmore resistant to expected coastal weather and drainage patterns. Road shoulders will be \npaved where possible to provide better access and safer conditions for cyclists and pedestrians. \nAbout 300 kilometers (km) of major coastal road links (class A and B) in tsunami-affected areas \nin the South and North East of Sri Lanka will be rebuilt.  \n \n  ", "  9\n37.  Subject to Board approval, and successful conclusion of a joint cofinancing agreement, \nADB  will  administer  a  European  Commission  grant  to  rehabilitate  sections  of  the  Matara-\nBatticaloa national road under TAARP. TAARP will both rebuild the roads after the tsunami and \nimprove  connections  between  the  southern  and  eastern  road  networks.  This  will  facilitate \ndelivery of supplies and promote economic development in conflict-affected areas.  \n \n38.  Access Roads. The local government roads subcomponent will include rehabilitation of \naccess  road  networks  and  bridges  damaged  by  the  tsunami  in  the  Galle,  Matara  and \nHambantota districts. About 200 km of damaged class C, D, and E provincial roads in the \nSouthern Province will be rebuilt and provided with improved drainage. Another 200 km of rural \nroads will be rebuilt in the coastal belt. Road safety improvements will be incorporated into \ndesigns  as  necessary.  Where  possible,  debris  will  be  recycled  for  use  as  road  sub-base \nmaterial for construction.  \n \n4.  Component D: Water Supply and Sanitation \n \n39.  Drinking water supply and sanitation schemes in Hambantota, Batticaloa and Muttur \ndistricts (which were affected by the tsunami) will be repaired and expanded. Subprojects will \nprovide  for  additional  distribution  using  temporary  intakes  and  for  community-based  water \nsupply together with individual sanitation facilities.  \n \n5.  Component E: Southern Province Reconstruction \n \n40.  Infrastructure. Subprojects in component E will restore livelihoods by creating jobs for \nlocally-based skilled and unskilled labor and reconstructing community and urban infrastructure, \nwhich could include local government roads, culverts, drains, small-scale water supply and \nsanitation  facilities,  simple  solid  waste  management  schemes,  village  markets  (polas), \nayurvedic  (traditional  medicine)  dispensaries,  children\u2019s  parks,  playgrounds,  community \nbuildings and rest houses, market and/or auction halls. Training for new employment skills will \nbe offered. Physical infrastructure and buildings, such as public libraries, courts, police stations, \nprisons,  and  district  registry  offices  needed  to  reestablish  an  effective  law  and  public \nadministration  system  will  also  be  reconstructed.  Designs  for  reconstructed  buildings  will \nprovide disabled access. Community-level subprojects will be selected and prioritized generally \nthrough the subproject selection process described in Appendix 6. TAARP will also support \ncommunity development planning and coordination at the local authority level.  \n \n41.  Shelter. Nearly 100,000 houses were destroyed by the tsunami. Other donors have \nmade  significant  commitments  for  the  reconstruction  of  damaged  or  destroyed  housing  in \ntsunami-affected areas. However, if demands  remain unmet, this component will construct \nshelter  for  vulnerable  tsunami-affected  families  in  the  Southern  Province.  Shelter  will  be \nprovided  in  situ\u2014only  at  preexisting  house  sites\u2014and  in  accordance  with  Government \nregulations  for  tsunami  reconstruction,  including  Government  policy  on  selection  and  total \nassistance  allowance  per  family.  If  adequate  donor  financing  is  available  for  shelter \nreconstruction,  funds  for  this  subcomponent  will  be  used  for  other  village  and  community \ninfrastructure subprojects.  \n \n6.  Component F: Coastal Resources Management \n \n42.  Subprojects  will  repair  damage  done  to  coastal  stabilization  structures  and  harbor \nbreakwaters, extend such structures, identify additional sites for improvements, and provide \nsmall fishing boat anchorages and fisheries-related ancillary units, such as boat-building yards, ", "10 \nnet repair sheds, or cold-storage facilities, in the Southern and Western provinces. Subprojects \nwill  also  provide  enhanced  coastal  protection  and  environmental  management  along  the \naffected coasts by reestablishing green zones or green belts through intensive forestation with \ncoastal vegetation, including mangroves. These green zones or belts will be effective barriers \nagainst  coastal  erosion  and  other  potentially  life-threatening  events  such  as  cyclones, \nhurricanes, floods, tsunamis, and higher sea levels. Where practical, tsunami debris will be used \nas core fill material for construction of breakwaters and groins.  \n \n7.  Component G: Rural Finance  \n \n43.  Immediate support is needed so affected people can rebuild their lives and regain their \ndignity,  and  so  local  economies  can  be  revived.  This  component  will  include  (i) restoring \nlivelihoods  of  affected  poor  households  or  groups  affected  by  the  tsunami  by  providing \nimmediate  access  to  noncommercial  microcredit,  (ii) supporting  microenterprise  and  skills \ntraining, (iii) mitigating risk by insuring affected households or individuals that receive assistance \nunder this component through life and property insurance schemes, and (iv) providing support \nfor operational costs and rebuilding of physical assets of microfinance institutions in remote \nareas.  \n \n44.  A  major  change  in  implementation  arrangements  for  the  Rural  Finance  Sector \nDevelopment Program13 (RFSDP) was approved by ADB Vice President (Operations Group 1) \non 23 February 2005 to provide microcredit will be provided to certain classes of tsunami \naffected people. TAARP will provide microcredit on similar but broader terms to the revised \narrangements to the tsunami-affected people who need them most\u2014low-income households, \nwhich  comprise  about  75%  of  all  affected  households.  The  interest  rate  charged  will  be \nnoncommercial and in line with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka directive for loans to tsunami-\naffected persons. These loans, together with rescheduling of existing debts, will enable more \nmoney  to  be  spent  on  household  needs.  Loans  to  affected  households  will  be  limited  to \nRs100,000 (approximately $1,000) to ensure a focus on poor households. The grant portion of \nthis component will be used to finance items (ii) to (v) above and detailed during inception.  \n \n8.  Component H: NECORD\u2014Tsunami \n \n45.  Some of the basic and social infrastructure works already replaced or rehabilitated in the \nNorth East coastal areas under NECORD were destroyed by the tsunami. Subprojects will \nredesign and rebuild structures in the health, education, water supply and sanitation, irrigation, \nrural roads, village and community development infrastructure, and fishing sectors. Shelter and \ninstitutional infrastructure, including courts and district registries, with improved access for the \ndisabled, will be provided at preexisting sites. Designs will incorporate risk-mitigating measures \nto improve durability and avert or reduce the impact of natural disasters.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n46.  TAARP will address urgent basic needs and social services lost as a result of the \ntsunami. If life in the affected and neighboring areas is to return to normal, social services must \nbe restored, destroyed infrastructure must be rebuilt, and access to employment opportunities \nmust be made available. TAARP has therefore been processed under ADB\u2019s disaster policy. \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2004.

Loan 2041-SRI. \nManila.  \n  ", "  11\nSince  interventions  will  typically  replace  preexisting  assets\u2014reconstructed  to  appropriate \ncontemporary standards\u2014economic analysis is not required.14 Investments will be made on the \nbasis  of  least-cost  restoration  of  preexisting  facilities.  The  procedures  for  project  loan \nprocessing, procurement, consultant engagement, subproject selection, and the type of works to \nbe done reflect this flexibility, without sacrificing quality, transparency, or safeguards. However, \nefforts  will  be  made  to  provide  proper  targeting,  subproject  control  and  monitoring,  and \ncommunity participation and to address area resource and capacity constraints.  \n \n47.  ADB will focus on ensuring project implementation is efficient, effective, and expedient. \nFollowing the disaster policy, additional resources have been dedicated to implementation, \nsupervision and monitoring, including (i) support for the National Procurement Agency, (ii) \nprovision of resettlement specialists and external monitors for unanticipated resettlement and \nland acquisition, (iii) an environment specialist to assist environmental assessment of tsunami-\nrelated  projects  by  the  Government's  Central  Environmental  Authority,  (iv)  additional \naccountants, (v) private sector financial auditors, and (vi) performance auditors.  \n \n48.  The  volume  and  scale  of  foreign  assistance  to  Sri  Lanka  will  generate  a  risk  of \ncorruption. The Government is committed to a zero-tolerance policy against corruption, and to \nensuring  that  vulnerable  tsunami-affected  people  are  adequately  protected.  TAARP \nincorporates features specifically designed to address these risks. It provides for enhanced \nsupervision and monitoring, regular financial and random performance audits, and measures to \nincrease transparency of tsunami assistance and policy, through publication of tsunami-related \nassistance and information in all three languages, in government newspapers and the internet. \nIt requires participation and consultation with local government, and civil society stakeholders, \nstarting with the planning and policy-setting stage. District-level consultations will be held to \ncomplete the needs assessment that will provide the framework for reconstruction activity. It will \nalso establishes decentralized mechanism(s) for ensuring public accountability, and addressing \nprivate grievances either by tsunami ombudsmen, tsunami mediation boards, or establishing a \ntsunami  unit  within  the  administrative  division  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  Bribery  and  Corruption \nCommission.  In  addition,  by  establishing  decentralized  provision  of  legal  assistance  and \nfacilitation, TAARP provides a means of legal empowerment and allows vulnerable and poor \ntsunami-affected people to access formal and informal channels of accountability and grievance \nreview. Finally, the issuance and reissuance of identification cards, computer automation of \nmanual  record  keeping  systems,  and  improved  and  networked  coordination  amongst \ndepartments accessing data will limit the extent that persons can abuse systems for tsunami \nassistance. These features are described in detail in Appendix 8.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n49.  The total cost of TAARP is estimated at $249.3 million equivalent, including taxes and \nduties of $36.7 million. Table 1 contains a summary cost estimate.

Portfolio  Restructuring.  The  Government  has  requested  that  ADB  cancel  and \nreallocate the surplus loan proceeds of the following projects: North Central Province Rural \nDevelopment Project15 ($0.5 million), Water Resources Management Project16 ($5 million), and \n                                                 \n15  ADB. 1996.

The European Commission (EC) has indicated that, subject to the condition in paras. 80 \nand 81, it will provide a grant of \u20ac40 million to rehabilitate roads in the South under component \nC. If approved by the ADB\u2019s Board and the European Union, the EC grant would be provided \nthrough, and administered by, ADB in accordance with the terms and conditions agreed upon \nbetween EC and ADB.  \n \n54.  The Government will allocate additional funding as needed to finance the remaining cost \nof $37.6 million for taxes and duties and $1.5 million in incremental expenditures (15.7% of total \ncost) in local currency.

An underlying objective of ADB\u2019s disaster policy and the strategy for ADB providing relief \nin Sri Lanka, is to coordinate with development partners, minimize duplication, encourage co-\nfinancing and have a catalytic effect on the provision of additional resources. As a result of the \nactive  participation  between  development  partners,  including  international  organizations, \nbilateral partners, and NGOs in coordination efforts post-tsunami, several development partners \nhave expressed willingness to provide cofinancing for various interventions to be made by \nTAARP.  The  European  Commission  is  prepared  to  provide  joint  cofinancing  with  ADB  for \ncomponent C, on the condition described in paragraphs 80 and 81 below. In addition, ADB has \ngarnered the interest of development partners in providing cofinancing18 for the construction of \nrural roads in the North and East, coastal community livelihood assistance in the East, and \ngeneral rehabilitation in the conflict-affected areas in the North and East. Given the short time \nframe for processing the Project, and considering the approval schedules of the various donors, \nfirm cofinancing commitments for additional expressions of interest, are expected only after \nimplementation begins. Such resources would be used to supplement not substitute for ADB \n                                                 \n17  ADB. 2002.

", "14 \nfinancing, however the allocation of ADB funds may as a consequence be adjusted to ensure \ndelivery of a balanced and demand-responsive assistance in the framework provided by the \nnational  post-tsunami  reconstruction  plan.  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  have  committed  to \nallocating if necessary their funds to fill gaps identified by the reconstruction plan that cannot be \naddressed by other financing sources.  \n \n56.  ADB has typically sought Board approval for the administration of the loan or grant funds \nof new co-financiers only when firm cofinancing commitments are in place. In light of (i) the \nneed for expediency and efficiency in ADB\u2019s response to the tsunami disaster and emergency, \nand (ii) the current advanced stage of discussions with a number of cofinanciers that are likely \nto  support  TAARP  subject  to  their  own  internal  approvals,  Management  requests  Board \napproval of the administration of additional cofinance funds obtained from development partners \nsubsequent to the date of Board approval. Approval of such additional cofinance funds would be \nconfirmed and approved by Management, and reported to the Board in accordance with the \nusual quarterly reporting. This procedure would only be adopted to the extent that the additional \nfunds provided by cofinanciers would not materially alter or fundamentally affect the objectives, \npurposes, and scope of the existing Project.19 Any proposed cofinance that did materially alter or \nfundamentally affect the objectives, purposes, and scope of TAARP would be processed as a \nmajor  change  in  scope  and  circulated  to  the  Board  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Project \nAdministration Instructions 5.0420 and the usual practice.  \n \nF.  Justification for Special Loan Terms and Grants  \n \n1.  ADB Loan  \n \n57.  Sri Lanka is a tsunami-affected country beginning rehabilitation and reconstruction. It is \nalso recovering from conflict and making the transition to peace and stability. The disaster policy \nmodifies the prevailing ADF lending terms approved by the ADB Board so they are appropriate \nfor disaster, emergency, and post-conflict assistance.21 ADB has approved the use of such \nterms in Bangladesh for the Emergency Flood Damage Rehabilitation Project (January 2005), in \nSri Lanka for the North East Community Restoration and Development \u2013 Extension Project22 \nand in the Maldives Tsunami Emergency Assistance Project (the Approved Loans). The loan \nfrom the portfolio reallocation from the ADF would be made on concessional terms permitted \nunder ADB's Disaster Policy and the same as those of the Approved Loans. The term of the \nloan will be 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years, with a repayment of principal at 2% \nper year for the first 10 years after the grace period and 4% a year thereafter, to be paid \nsemiannually, with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum.  \n \n2.  ATF Grant \n \n58.  Sri  Lanka  is  eligible  to  receive  tsunami  grant  funds  in  accordance  with  the  terms \napproved by the Board under the Asian Tsunami Fund.23  \n                                                 \n19  ADB. 2001.

Several ongoing ADB projects respond to needs that are similar to or directly match \nthose caused by the tsunami. Some of the improvements that have been made by these \nprojects sustained tsunami damage, resulting in a change in overall project quantity within the \nexisting  scope  of  the  project  or  minor  increases  to  the  existing  scope.  Road  Network \nImprovement24 (RNIP) is rehabilitating national roads (class A and B) nationwide, including \nbridges as required. Coastal Resources Management25 (CRMP) is providing coastal shoreline \nprotection  measures  and  harbor  facilities  in  Southern  and  Western  provinces.  North  East \nCommunity Restoration and Development26 (NECORD) is rebuilding community-level basic and \nsocial infrastructure damaged or destroyed throughout the North East. Southern Province Rural \nEconomic Advancement27 (SPREAP) is rehabilitating roads and village markets in the Southern \nProvince.  Secondary  Towns  and  Rural  Community-based  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation28 \n(STWSS)  is  providing  water  supply  schemes  and  independent  sanitation  facilities  for  four \nsecondary towns in the Central, South and East provinces. North East Coastal Community \nDevelopment Project29 (NECCDP) is improving coastal community infrastructure, protecting the \ncoastal environment, and providing a credit facility for coastal dwellers in the Eastern Province. \nRural Finance Sector Development Program (footnote 13) provides microcredit through 140 \nparticipating microfinance institutions nationwide.  \n \n60.  For  component  A,  a  project  office,  led  by  the  component  coordinator/director,  and \nsupported adequately to conduct the component A activities, would be established within the \nMOJ. For components B through H, TAARP will be implemented through these existing project \nmanagement units (together with the project office for component A, hereinafter called the \nPMUs). Although from ADB's loan processing perspective this approach may initially appear \ncomplex, from the Government's perspective and from the perspective of ensuring effective, \nefficient, and rapid implementation and the fastest delivery of benefits to affected people, it is \nthe most straightforward. It will strengthen existing offices and institutions that are already \nfunctioning well, rather than developing new ones.  \n \n61.  Because of the large amount of additional funding that they will administer, each PMU \nwill be strengthened to accommodate the additional workload. Accounting staff will be added in \nmost PMUs and district PMUs (DPMUs). Where a considerable amount of smaller infrastructure \n                                                 \n24  ADB. 1998.

The NPCC will be chaired by the Secretary, MOFP.  \n \n63.  To  coordinate  component  A  and  the  governance  activities  of  other  development \npartners, a coordinating committee will be established and meet bimonthly. It will be chaired by \nthe Secretary, MOJ, and comprised of representatives from the Ministry of Public Security, Law \nand Order, the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs, the Registrar General\u2019s \nDepartment, the Department of the Registration of Persons, the Office of the President, SPC \nand NEPC, and any other relevant persons.  \n \n64.  To ensure beneficiary participation during project preparation and implementation, sector \nsubprojects will be prepared for and approved by a provincial project coordination committee \n(PPCC, either North East or South)..30 The NPCC will (i) review subprojects approved by the \nPPCC to ensure they comply with selection criteria, and are distributed appropriately among \ncommunities  and  areas;  (ii) monitor  overall  project  implementation;  (iii) resolve  serious \nimplementation problems, in particular those related to access by personnel, equipment, and \nmaterials into the project area; and (iv) coordinate with other national government agencies and \nprojects involved in relief and rehabilitation. Assistance at national and regional levels will be \nprovided by consultants. The NPCC and the PPCCs will meet as required, but at least quarterly.  \n \n65.  The  North  East  Provincial  Council  (NEPC)  currently  performs  this  function  very \neffectively for ADB projects in the North East. Consultants funded by technical assistance will \nhelp  to  adopt  this  system  in  the  Southern  Provincial  Council  (footnote  2).  The  subproject \nselection process, as developed for subprojects in the North East for NECORD, is detailed in \nAppendix 6. This method will be used for rural road and community infrastructure subproject \nselection in both the North East and the South. Road rehabilitation of class A and B roads will \nbe prioritized by the relevant provincial council, and implemented with the concurrence of the \nRoad Development Authority.  \n \n66.  District-level  project  organization  will  use  existing  structures  of  the  Government, \nincluding district coordination committees. The district secretaries31 will act as secretaries to \nthese  committees  and  provide  initial  screening  of  subproject  proposals  before  they  are \nsubmitted to PMU and PPCC. The project organization in each district will be headed by a \ndeputy project director, and will take direct responsibility for implementing the Project at district \nand  division  levels.  The  overall  implementation  arrangement  for  TAARP  is  presented  in \nAppendix 10.  \n \n67.  The  project  management  arrangements  described  here\u2014a  decentralized  system \nallowing  provinces  to  finalize  subproject  selection\u2014reflect  the  present  government \nadministration  structure  in  the  South  and  the  North  East.

", "18 \nTAARP\u2019s finance agreement addresses this by referring to successor entities and arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB.  \n \n68.  With the exception of component A, each component of TAARP will be administered by \nthe relevant ADB division currently administering the parent loan project. Component A will be \nadministered by the ADB Sri Lanka Resident Mission in Colombo with the assistance of the \nOffice of the General Counsel. However, given the complexity and sensitivity of TAARP and the \nneed for close coordination with the actors in the North East\u2014the Government, LTTE, external \nassistance agencies, NGOs, and others\u2014all components under TAARP will be administered in \nclose cooperation with the Resident Mission. In addition, the Resident Mission will appoint a \nnational officer with joint disbursement and financial management responsibilities. Among other \nthings,  this  financial  management  specialist  will  (i) pre-screen  withdrawal  applications, \n(ii) monitor statement of expenditure (SOE) performance and assist in the SOE audit, (iii) review \nsubproject documentation to assess financial sustainability, (iv) review audit reports and attempt \nto clear outstanding audit observations, and (v) provide disbursement training to PMU and \nDPMU staff during project implementation to ensure efficient disbursement.  \n \n69.  A financial management assessment of the selected PMUs and the DPMUs was carried \nout with the objective of reviewing their internal control frameworks, disbursement constraints, \nand  audit  issues.  Each  PMU  and  DPMU  follows  the  ledger-based  manual  government \naccounting system. Although it is not ideal, this system is acceptable to ADB. Staff at each PMU \nand DPMU possess sufficient accounting skills, but some PMU and DPMUs will add accounting \nstaff. These additional staff will be financed by the ATF grant. No significant disbursement \nissues or constraints were identified in any of the PMUs or DPMUs. The Resident Mission\u2019s \nfinancial management specialist will closely monitor project accounting aspects and provide \ndisbursement training where necessary to PMUs and DPMUs during implementation. The audit \nreports of four32 PMUs were reviewed and all were found to be unqualified. In all but one case, \nreports were received before the due dates. For the remaining three projects33 the first audit is \ndue only in the latter part of fiscal year 2005. In addition, an SOE audit of the ongoing loans \nbeing managed by all PMUs will be conducted within 6 months of loan effectiveness of the \nproposed project as a means of providing further assurance on the internal controls in each \nPMU.  Details  of  the  financial  management  assessment  are  provided  in  Supplementary \nAppendix C.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n32  ADB. 1998.

Subprojects will be selected to ensure rehabilitation activities are distributed equitably \nacross all the tsunami-affected districts\u2014taking into account geographic and sector balances as \nwell as the ethnic composition of the areas. Subprojects will be selected in accordance with \nsector-specific criteria agreed upon by the Government and ADB (Appendix 5a). In addition, \nregardless of the sector, each subproject proposal will be evaluated on the basis of general \ncriteria, as set forth below.  \n \n(i)  The subproject will rehabilitate or reconstruct tsunami-damaged infrastructure, \nand/or directly address the requirements of tsunami-affected people. \n \n(ii)  The subproject will be identified and prioritized based on the tsunami needs \nassessment  for  the  area  and  will  take  into  account  consultations  with \nbeneficiaries and affected people. \n(iii)  The subproject will reflect the requirement that there should be a reasonable \nbalance of activities among communities and districts. \n \n(iv)  The subproject will not be financed by ADB if it is being financed by another \ndevelopment  partner,  unless  the  other  development  partner  and  ADB  are \ncofinancing it, and where practical, preference will be given to other development \npartners that express interest in financing the subproject. \n \n(v)  The  subproject  will  be  technically  feasible,  financially  sustainable,  and  will \nrepresent the least-cost alternative, taking into account the need to provide for a \nreasonable increase in demand in the future;  \n \n(vi)  The equipment, materials, and other resources required can be acquired in, or \ntransported to, the subproject location without unreasonable obstruction or delay. \n \n(vii)  The subproject can be completed within the remaining implementation period; \n \n(viii)  The subproject will not use asbestos in construction or as a construction material.  \n \n(ix)  The  subproject  will  be  in  compliance  with  the  Government's  environmental \nrequirements,  ADB's  Environment  Policy34  (2002),  and  the  Environmental \nAssessment  and  Review  Framework.  For  subprojects  that  require  an  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE),  the  IEE  will  be  included  in  the  subproject \nproposal, and government environmental clearance will have been obtained prior \nto the award of the subproject contract. The subproject is not a Category A \nsubproject. \n \n(x)  The  subproject  will  not,  to  the  extent  possible,  require  land  acquisition  or \ninvoluntary resettlement. If either of these is, in fact, required in the course of \nTAARP, it will be conducted in conformity with the Government\u2019s applicable law \nand policy, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy 35 (1995), and the resettlement \nframework.  \n \n                                                 \n34  ADB. 2002.

", "20 \n(xi)  The subproject will, to the extent possible, not affect any indigenous peoples, but \nif the subproject does affect indigenous peoples, it has been or will be prepared \nand conducted in accordance with applicable law, ADB\u2019s Indigenous People\u2019s \nPolicy, and the Indigenous People\u2019s Development Framework;  \n \n(xii)  Equal access to resources, services and opportunities for women and men will \nbe promoted in subproject design, planning and implementation.  \n \n(xiii)  The  subproject  will  incorporate  strengthening  to  multi-hazard  standards  with \nadequate  provision  for  technological  improvement  and  quality  control, \nconsidering cost effectiveness, and least cost alternatives. \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n \n71.  Although  project  administration  systems  for  each  component  are  already  fully \nfunctioning, and subproject implementation can therefore commence quickly, the geographic \ndistribution  and  extent  of  damage  caused  by  the  tsunami  necessitate  that  TAARP  be \nimplemented over a 4-year period. This will provide time to design and package civil works \ncontracts\u2014particularly for road rebuilding\u2014and for adequate consultation and development of \nvarious village and community subprojects. The scheduled completion date is 30 June 2009 \n(Appendix 11).  \n \n4.  Social and Environmental Measures \n \n72.  TAARP is not expected to require land acquisition or resettlement; only vacant state-\nowned land is expected to be used for subproject improvements. Rehabilitation and rebuilding \nwill typically take place only at existing infrastructure locations. The works will be designed to \nensure that improvements will be within existing property boundaries. However, a summary \nresettlement framework (Appendix 12) has been agreed upon by the Government and ADB.  \nWhile  no  resettlement  is  anticipated,  the  agreed  Resettlement  Framework  sets  out  the \ncompensation and other entitlements for any unanticipated land acquisition and/or resettlement. \nIn addition, the Financing Agreements contain detailed covenants that require the Government \nto comply with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). The policy and legal framework \nfor  Government  post-tsunami  assistance  is  being  developed,  with  new  guidelines  recently \nadopted, and new laws under consideration.36 While a Resettlement Framework is usually \nfinalized by Board approval, the agreed Resettlement Framework for TAARP may be refined by \nADB in consultation with the Government prior to any land acquisition and/or resettlement under \nTAARP, to improve implementation in light of the Governments\u2019 post-tsunami policy and legal \nframework.  Such refinements would be made to ensure  continued compliance with ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995), as would be allowed under the disaster policy.37  \n \n73.  Since TAARP\u2019s aim is to rebuild preexisting infrastructure damaged or destroyed as a \nresult of the tsunami, it is classified as environmental category B. No subprojects classified as \ncategory A by ADB will be financed under TAARP. A generic initial environmental examination \n(IEE)  has  been  prepared  to  identify  potential  impacts  that  could  result  from  TAARP,  to \nrecommend  mitigation  measures  and  to  suggest  suitable  monitoring  mechanisms.

In addition, two bills are currently under consideration. \n37 Para. 95 of the Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. \n  ", "  21\nsummary IEE is presented in Appendix 13. While TAARP may lead to temporary and reversible \nlocalized  negative  impacts,  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  foreseen. \nSubprojects will follow environmental assessment procedures stipulated in the environmental \nassessment framework (Appendix 14). The environmental assessment framework has been \ndeveloped to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and the Government\u2019s \nenvironmental regulations.  \n \n74.  A  few  small  communities  of  indigenous  people  (the  Veddas)  were  affected  by  the \ntsunami and may be affected by TAARP, which is designed to ensure that all communities, on \nan equitable basis, will benefit from TAARP. In the event of their involvement in any subprojects, \nall necessary actions required under ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) will be taken. \nTAARP will address the special needs of minority communities in the context of their social and \ncultural systems. An indigenous peoples development framework (IPDF) has been prepared to \naddress potential impacts on these communities. The IPDF provides a policy framework to \nscreen impacts of the subprojects on the coastal Veddas and, accordingly, to prepare an \nappropriate  indigenous  peoples  development  plan  or  specific  actions  for  the  subprojects \naffecting the coastal Veddas. A summary IPDF is presented in Appendix 15.  \n \n5.  Procurement of Civil Works and Equipment \n \n75.  Procurement of goods and services under TAARP will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and the Government\u2019s tender procedures acceptable to \nADB.  ADB\u2019s  disaster  policy  permits  flexible  interpretation  of  these  guidelines,  so  project \nactivities can start promptly. ADB has also been advising the National Procurement Agency on \nmeasures the Government can take to streamline and accelerate the procurement process \nwithout sacrificing transparency and competition. Consultant support will be provided through \nTAARP to continue and formalize procedural improvements.  \n \n76.  For civil works contracts with estimated values greater than $5 million, procurement will \nbe  in  accordance  with  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  For  contracts  with \nestimated  values  of  $5 million  and  below,  procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  local \ncompetitive bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to ADB. LCB civil works procurement will \ninclude  single-stage,  two-envelope  procedures  where  relevant.  For  tsunami-related \nprocurement, local competitive bidding periods can be reduced from 21 to 15 days.  \n \n77.  Equipment and materials will be procured under international competitive bidding where \nthe estimated cost is more than $500,000 equivalent, by international shopping where the \nestimated cost is between $300,000 and $500,000 equivalent, and through local procurement \nprocedures acceptable to ADB where the estimated cost is $300,000 equivalent or less. Items \ncosting less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured through direct purchase.  \n \n78.  The standard bidding documents previously approved by ADB under RNIP, STWSS, \nand CRMP, will be adopted for subprojects in components C, D, and F, subject to a one-time \nreview by ADB to ensure that they still comply with ADB requirements. ADB will permit after-the-\nfact approval in accordance with the Project Administration Instructions for all civil works valued \nat more than $500,000 and for supply contracts valued at more than $250,000, prior to award of \nthe  respective  contracts.  For  contracts  valued  at  less  than  these  amounts,  the  respective \nexecuting agencies (EAs) will submit copies of the signed contracts and bid evaluation reports \nfor approval after-the-fact. However, if ADB does not approve the award or terms of any such \ncontract, the Government will not use loan or grant proceeds to finance such contract, and in \nthe event that loan or grant proceeds are used to finance such contract, the Government will ", "22 \nrefund to ADB any such payment. An independent procurement audit, if required, is provided for \nin TAARP project costs.  \n \n79.  Contractors already engaged through competitive bidding under ongoing loans may be \ndirectly contracted for new civil works contracts for $1,000,000 or less and supply contracts for \n$500,000 or less, without resorting to new bidding and prequalification. This will be done where \npractical, or when such hiring would be a logical extension of services already underway.  \n \n80.  As described above in para. 55, the European Commission is prepared to commit to \nprovide joint cofinancing with ADB, allowing ADB to catalyze additional resources for the Project \nand  tsunami  assistance.  For  the  European  Commission  to  participate,  it  requires  non-\ndiscrimination  against  all  its  members  in  procurement  processes.  Thus,  while  most  of  the \ninvestments to be supported by the Project are expected to come from within Sri Lanka or to \ninvolve  some  procurement  from  ADB  member  countries,  to  facilitate  the  European \nCommission\u2019s  commitment  to  cofinance  \u20ac40 million  of  roads  under  Component  C,  Board \napproval is now being sought to allow procurement in, and procurement of eligible goods and \nservices from, member countries of the European Union, including ADB non-member countries. \nThis would facilitate maximum and expeditious development and catalyze additional resources \nfrom development partners in the current post-tsunami emergency circumstance.  \n \n81.  The request for Board approval is being made pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the ADB \nCharter, which states that the Board may, by a vote of the Directors representing not less than \ntwo thirds of the total voting power of the members, approve procurement from non-ADB \nmember countries in appropriate circumstances.38 The Charter provides one, non-exclusive, \nexample of what may constitute \u201cappropriate circumstances\u201d for allowing procurement in non-\nADB member countries or procurement of goods and services produced in non-ADB member \ncountries. It states that the Charter\u2019s requirement that procurement occur only in member \ncountries may be lifted \u201cin the case of a non-member country in which a significant amount of \nfinancing has been provided to the Bank.\u201d This example is similar to the current proposal. The \nEuropean Commission is providing a grant of \u20ac40 million, which is a significant amount of \nfinancing that matches ADB\u2019s contribution to component C of TAARP. The European Union, \nwhich is supporting the European Commission\u2019s provision of such financing includes ADB \nmembers  and  non-members  that  are  together  providing  this  contribution  by  way  of  joint \ncofinancing for TAARP. The Board\u2019s approval for lifting the procurement restriction is being \nrequested only in support of component C of TAARP. \n \n82.  The Government has requested ADB\u2019s approval of advance action for procurement of \ncivil works, including inviting and receiving bids for contracts, for subprojects that might be \napproved for implementation prior to loan effectiveness. The Government has been advised that \nADB\u2019s approval of advance action would not commit ADB to financing TAARP.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n38  Article 14(ix) of the Charter, provides: \u201cThe proceeds of any loan, investment or other financing undertaken in the \nordinary operations of the Bank or with Special Funds established by the Bank pursuant to paragraph 1(I) of Article \n19, shall be used only for procurement in member countries of goods and services produced in member countries, \nexcept in any case in which the Board of Directors by a vote of the Directors representing not less than \ntwo-thirds of the total voting power of the members, determines to permit procurement in a non-member \ncountry or of goods and services produced in a non-member country in special circumstances making such \nprocurement appropriate, as in the case of a nom-member country in which a significant amount of financing has \nbeen provided to the Bank.\u201d[emphasis added]  \n  ", "  23\n6.  Consulting Services \n \n83.  Consulting services will be required for the development of detailed designs and contract \npackages and for community development planning in several components. Consultants will \nalso be required to support the Government\u2019s implementing structures currently being formed at \nnational and regional levels with project management and overall monitoring responsibilities. \nGiven the need to expedite delivery of project benefits to affected people, the Government has \nasked  that  consultants  for  component  C  be  engaged  by  ADB,  in  consultation  with  the \nGovernment, and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  international  and  domestic \nconsultants.  \n \n84.  Consultants for component C, road rehabilitation and reconstruction, will be selected \nfrom among existing consultant design firms already engaged in ongoing road sector projects in \nSri Lanka, subject to satisfactory performance, based on bio-data proposals using the quality \nand  cost-based  method  of  selection.  The  period  for  the  proposals  will  be  21  days.  A \nprocurement specialist will be provided through this contract to assist the National Procurement \nAgency  in  expediting  civil  works  and  equipment  procurement  procedures  and  refining \nguidelines. An environmental specialist will also be provided to assist the Central Environment \nAuthority review and assess environmental assessment for tsunami related subprojects.  \n \n85.  Consulting design services required for component D and component F will be engaged \nthrough direct selection, and will extend existing contracts under STWSS (footnote 28) and \nCRMP  (footnote  25),  respectively.  New  individual  consultants,  primarily  in  accounting  and \ngeneral engineering, will be selected and engaged on all components in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. Individual consultants will be engaged for the governance, \nlegal assistance and anticorruption component including to provide legal assistance, training \nand  awareness  building;  coordination,  monitoring,  and  supervision;  computerized  data \ncollection, and related computer services including web design. Individual consultants will also \nassist in preparing gender-oriented economic activities and business cooperatives. NGOs will \nassist implementation of village and community development subprojects. TAARP will require \napproximately 115 person-months of international consulting services and 881 person-months \nof  domestic  consulting  services.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  representative  consultant \nassignments are provided in Appendix 16.  \n \n86.  The Government has requested ADB\u2019s approval of advance action for recruitment of \nconsultants,  including  preparing  and  negotiating  direct  selection  contracts  with  consultants \nalready installed on other ongoing ADB-financed projects. The Government has been advised \nthat ADB\u2019s approval of advance action would not commit ADB to financing TAARP.  \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n87.  Disbursement arrangements for each component will follow the existing fund flow and \ndisbursement arrangements at each existing PMU and DPMU. Given the emergency nature of \nthe  proposed  project  and  the  financial  management  assessment,  the  disbursement \narrangements at established PMUs are considered optimal for financing activities in a speedy \nand effective manner. Under component A, component C, component D and component G, \nimprest accounts will be established at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), and second \ngeneration imprest accounts will be established at banks agreed with ADB. Under component B, \ncomponent  E,  and  component  H,  imprest  accounts  will  be  established  at  CBSL,  second ", "24 \ngeneration imprest accounts will be established at the provincial level, and third generation \nimprest accounts will be established at DPMUs. An imprest account for component F will be \nestablished at CBSL. Under component G, separate accounts will be established for the loan \nand the grant. Such accounts will be established, replenished and maintained in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  Detailed  disbursements  arrangements  for  each \nTAARP component are in Appendix 17.  \n \n8.  Retroactive Financing \n \n88.  To implement protective works and other tsunami-related activities, the Government has \nasked for retroactive financing for immediate imports, rehabilitation of key infrastructure and \nfacilities, and provision of services and grants. ADB has agreed to provide retroactive financing \nof up to 30% of each component in tsunami-affected areas for eligible expenditures covering all \ndisbursement  categories  incurred  not  earlier  than  27  December  2004,  provided  that  the \nexpenditures are procured in accordance with agreed procedures. The Government has been \nadvised that provision of retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing any part of \nTAARP.  \n \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n89.  Each EA, IA and PMU will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify \nfinancing resources received and expenditures made for each TAARP component, including the \ngoods, works, and services financed by loan, grant and local funds. These project accounts and \nrelated  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing \nstandards by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. Provision for financial auditing costs has \nbeen included in the cost estimate and will be financed through TAARP. Each EA will submit \nannual audited reports and related financial statements to ADB within 6 months of the end of \neach fiscal year. The audit of imprest accounts, second-generation imprest accounts, third-\ngeneration imprest accounts, and SOE will be carried out as part of the annual audit, with the \nauditor\u2019s opinion of each separately set out in the auditor\u2019s report. Financial audits provided in 6 \nmonths by  private sector auditors may be provided in advance of the Sri Lankan Auditor \nGeneral\u2019s statutory audited accounts. If there is any discrepancy, ADB and Sri Lanka will \nconsult on the reasons for this and next steps to be followed.  \n \n90.  Each  PMU  will  prepare  brief  progress  reports  each  month  for  their  respective \ncomponents for submission to ADB and their EA. In addition, PMUs responsible to provincial \nproject coordinating committees (PPCCs) will submit quarterly reports to ADB and their PPCCs. \nSubproject  completion  reports,  which  identify  project  impact,  will  be  prepared  for  each \nsubproject. Within 3 months of the physical completion of TAARP, the Government will furnish \nto ADB an overall project completion report providing a detailed evaluation of the project design, \ncosts, contractor and consultant performance, social and economic impact, and other details as \nmay be requested by ADB.  \n \n91.  As required by the ADB disaster policy, provision for supervision and monitoring of \nTAARP  has  been  enhanced  to  ensure  quality  and  effectiveness  at  a  time  when  the \nGovernment\u2019s financial and human resources are extended.39 Consultants will be provided to \nsupport the Government\u2019s implementing structures currently being formed. They will assist at \nthe  national  and/or  regional  levels  with  project  management  and  overall  monitoring \nresponsibilities.  Procurement  specialists  will  assist  the  National  Procurement  Agency  in \n                                                 \n39  Para. 107 of the Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. \n  ", "  25\nexpediting  civil  works  and  equipment  procurement  procedures  and  refining  guidelines.  In \naddition, independent auditors, civil society organizations (CSOs), or NGOs will be engaged to \nconduct semiannual performance audits during project implementation, to determine the degree \nto which TAARP funds have been effectively and efficiently used during implementation, and the \nextent to which the objectives, outputs, and performance indicators have been achieved. The \nfinal performance audit (to be conducted post completion) will focus on governance, financial \naccountability, and transparency.40 Provision has been included in the cost estimates to cover \nperformance  auditing  throughout  implementation.  The  Government  will  be  responsible  for \ncovering the cost of the final post completion performance audit.  \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n \n92.  Each PMU has established performance monitoring indicators and relevant baseline \ndata for their respective components. These existing monitoring mechanisms will be expanded, \nand  will  be  recorded  separately  for  each  component  under  TAARP.  For  activities  where \nsubprojects are formulated and designed during implementation, baseline indicators and targets \nfor each subproject, including the socioeconomic conditions of the beneficiaries, will be included \nas  part  of  the  subproject  proposal.  Baseline  data  for  road  projects  implemented  under \ncomponent C will record the existing \u201croughness\u201d (based on a visual assessment) and traffic \nlevels.  The  management  information  system  developed  for  NECORD\u2014in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  project  performance  management  evaluation  system\u2014will  be  updated  and  used  to \nmonitor subproject benefits and impacts for components B and H.  \n \n93.  Gender-disaggregated data will be collected during project monitoring and evaluation. \nMonitoring systems will incorporate such data and processes of review and evaluation would \ncover both quantitative and qualitative gender-based information.  \n \n11.  Project Review \n \n94.  ADB will conduct regular reviews (at least once every 6 months) throughout project \nimplementation. TAARP will also be reviewed quarterly by the staff of the Resident Mission as \npart of the overall portfolio review process. Staff of the Resident Mission will also attend NPCC, \nand PPCC meetings in the South and the North East to consider and approve subprojects for \nimplementation.  Given  the  complexities  of  implementation  and  the  4-year  implementation \nperiod, a midterm review will be carried out during the second year of implementation, about \nJune 2007, for which the Government will submit to ADB a detailed progress report on the \nimplementation and achievement of TAARP.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED NORTH EAST COMMUNITY RESTORATION  \nAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II \n \nA.  Objective \n \n95.  The main objective of NECORD-II is rapidly to improve the living conditions and well-\nbeing of a significant number of people in conflict-affected areas by restoring basic social \ninfrastructure, community and public services, and livelihoods. NECORD-II will also support and \naugment Sri Lanka\u2019s rehabilitation and relief efforts underway in the conflict-affected North East.  \n \n                                                 \n40  Para. 108 of the Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. ", "26 \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n96.  Rehabilitation  subprojects  will  address  (i) community  development,  (ii) civil  works \u2013\n access/rural roads, (iii) institutional infrastructure and institutional strengthening, and (iv) civil \nworks \u2013 basic infrastructure. Subprojects will be selected and prioritized generally through the \nsubproject selection process described in Appendix 6.  \n \n1.  Community Development \n \n97.  Village Development. A wide range of village-level subprojects across several sectors \nwill restore livelihoods, provide opportunities for income generation, and support reconciliation \nand social cohesion. Livelihood opportunities will be provided in the agricultural sector through \nsubprojects that promote livestock development and market gardening, and provide facilities for \nseed  production.  District  agriculture  centers  will  be  restored  to  assist  farmers.  Skills \ndevelopment and training will be provided for micro-enterprise development in areas such as \nhorticulture, food processing, and tourism. To enable community-based organizations (CBOs) to \npromote micro-enterprises at the village level, revolving funds will be established and managed \nby  CBOs.  Gender-oriented  enterprise  programs,  initiated  as  a  pilot  program  under  the \nNECORD \u2013 Extension  Project,  will  be  expanded  to  cover  a  wider  range  of  coastal  and \nagricultural communities. Given the influx of construction workers, an HIV/AIDS awareness \ncampaign  will  be  carried  out  among  construction  workers  and  internally  displaced  people. \nNECORD-II will also promote the advancement of women at women\u2019s industrial centers, an \ninitiative begun under the NECORD \u2013 Extension Project.  \n \n98.  Shelter. Conflict-affected returnees will be provided shelter at their previous house sites. \nShelter reconstruction will follow Government policy in the selection of families and the total \nassistance allowance per family.  \n \n2.  Civil Works\u2014Access Roads  \n \n99.  Access road construction will use labor-intensive methods to provide gravel-surfaced \nrural roads, connecting villages to the road network, irrigation schemes, or community facilities. \nA small number of class C or D provincial roads will be rehabilitated with all-weather surfaces. \nAll  road  construction  will  be  on  existing  alignments  and  is  not  expected  to  require  land \nacquisition or resettlement.  \n \n3.  Institutional Infrastructure  \n \n100.  Infrastructure and Institutional Strengthening. Institutional capacity will be improved \nthrough subprojects that restore or reestablish damaged local government facilities and district \noffices, and rehabilitate courts and registrars\u2019 offices in the North East. Designs for replacement \nfacilities will provide disabled access. NECORD-II will also supply training to staff on public \nadministration, accounts, and information management. In anticipation of the growing need for \nskilled  employees,  training  will  be  given  to  youths  in  construction,  motor  mechanics,  and \ntourism-related trades, and will encompass construction of any special facilities required to \nprovide these trainings.  \n \n4.  Civil Works\u2014Basic Infrastructure \n \n101.  Health.  Subprojects  will  restore  critical  referral  medical  facilities  through  hospital \nreconstruction  and  refurbishment,  provision  and  replacement  of  medical  equipment  and \n  ", "  27\nfurniture, construction of doctor\u2019s quarters at hospital compounds, and rehabilitation of village \nhealth clinics.  \n \n102.  Education.  Subprojects  will  restore  services  and  facilities  by  (i) reconstructing  and \nrehabilitating teaching facilities and school buildings; (ii) constructing cluster housing units for \nteachers on unencumbered lands, in areas where existing housing is limited or unavailable; and \n(iii) providing teacher training in primary education, English, science and math. Training will be \nprovided to improve the quality of the teachers, especially new recruits.  \n \n103.  Water Supply and Sanitation. Improvements will be made to the water supply and \nsanitation facilities in small and medium-sized towns. These will be linked to village community \ndevelopment activities, particularly where internally displaced persons (IDPs) are returning.  \n \n104.  Irrigation.  Existing  medium-sized  and  large  irrigation  schemes  will  be  rehabilitated \nthrough restoration of tank bunds, channel systems, access roads, and other structures, without \nchanges to, or diversions of, natural watercourses. The activity will be linked to the village, \nagriculture and livestock development.  \n \n105.  Land mine and unexploded ordnance (UXO) contamination of proposed subproject sites \nin the North East is not expected to be substantial, even after the effects of the tsunami. \nAlthough there are a significant number of landmines and UXO still uncleared in the North \nEast\u2014contaminated areas were well defined prior to the tsunami\u2014most coastal areas, being \ndensely populated, had already been priorities for mine and UXO clearance. In these areas, \nthere were few mines left. Areas around military installations on the coast, where mines were \nconcentrated, may have been affected by the tsunami, but dealing with these is relatively \nstraightforward, as the number of affected areas is small. Clearance in the tsunami-affected \nareas is currently being done by agencies already involved in mine clearance (e.g., the Sri \nLankan Army and the HALO Trust) and has almost been completed. However, as a further \nsafeguard, provisions for obtaining clearance certification of subproject sites in the North East \nwill be incorporated into each civil works contract.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n106.  NECORD-II has been formulated to address urgent basic needs and social services lost \nas a result of the 20-year conflict and is therefore, like TAARP, being processed under the \ndisaster policy. NECORD-II will be implemented expeditiously, but extra effort and time will be \ntaken  to  provide  proper  targeting  and  adequate  subproject  control  and  monitoring,  ensure \ncommunity  participation,  and  address  area  resource  capacity  constraints.  NECORD-II \ninterventions  will  generally  replace  preexisting  assets,  reconstructed  to  appropriate \ncontemporary standards. Economic analysis is not required, but investments will be made on \nthe basis of least-cost restoration of pre-existing facilities.  \n \n107.  NECORD-II  takes  a  proactive  stance  towards  the  risks  of  increased  HIV/AIDS41 \ntransmission  by  providing  an  awareness  training  program.  Given  the  recent  increase  in \nconstruction  in  the  North  East\u2014in  particular  for  large-scale  infrastructure  projects  soon  to \nbegin\u2014and in cooperation with other HIV/AIDS programs already underway in Sri Lanka, the \nprogram will focus on workers and their families, who will be educated on the basic facts of HIV \ntransmission and how to protect themselves and their partners, and provided with opportunities \nto discuss the risk of HIV transmission.  \n                                                 \n41  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. ", "28 \n108.  NECORD-II  will  expand  the  pilot  gender  enterprise  initiative  started  under  the \nNECORD \u2013 Extension Project (footnote 22), to promote the advancement of women through \neconomic  activities  at  women\u2019s  industrial  centers.  Consultants  will  provide  guidance  on \nestablishing the centers, which will be formed by women\u2019s groups. NECORD-II will build on \nexisting district women's rural development societies and involve women\u2019s NGOs, which will be \nidentified at the implementation stage.  \n \n109.  NECORD-II has many of the same governance features as TAARP (refer to Appendix \n8). \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n110.  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $55.0 million.  Loan  financing  of  $26.0 million \nequivalent is composed of $10.6 million in foreign exchange and $15.4 million equivalent in local \ncurrency costs. Table 4 contains a summary cost estimate. Appendix 9b contains detailed \nproject costs and the financing plan for NECORD-II.  \nTable 4: NECORD-II Cost Estimatesa \n($ million)  \nForeign  Local   \nItem \nExchange Currency  Total\nGrant:       \n1.

Financing Plan \n \n111.  The Government has asked that ADB finance the cost of the activities to be undertaken \nunder the scope of NECORD\u2013II except for duties, taxes, and incremental expenditures, with a \nloan not exceeding $26 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources and a grant of \n$14 million from the eighth replenishment of the ADF. The Borrower will be the Government of \nSri Lanka. These funds will be used entirely for rehabilitation and other programs proposed in \nthe conflict-affected areas of the North East. A single financing agreement will govern both the \nloan and the ADF grant for NECORD-II.  \n \n112.  The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), has expressed its \nwillingness to provide SKr40 million on a grant basis to finance 100% of the cost, excluding \nduties and taxes, of rehabilitating provincial and rural roads in the North East under NECORD-II. \nIf approved by the Government of Sweden, the Sida Grant will be provided through, and \nadministered by, ADB in accordance with the terms and conditions agreed upon between Sida \nand the ADB. A breakdown of the financing plan is presented in Table 5.  \n113.  The provisions set forth in para. 56 for accepting cofinancing for TAARP after Board \napproval  are  also  requested  for  any  additional  cofinancing  for  NECORD-II,  and  would  be \njustified on the same basis.  \n \nTable 5: NECORD-II Financing Plan \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local     \nSource  Exchange Currency  Total  % \nAsian Development Fund Grant a      14.0  25.4 \nAsian Development Fund Loan  10.6  15.4  26.0  47.3 \nAsian Development Bank      40.0  72.7 \nGovernment of Sri Lanka  0  9.1  9.1  16.6 \nGovernment of Sweden      5.9  10.7 \nTotal  18.2  36.8  55.0  100 \nNECORD = North East Community Restoration and Development Project.  \na Grant financing does not distinguish between foreign exchange and local currency.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Justification for Special Loan Terms and Grants \n \n1.  ADF Loan  \n \n114.  Sri Lanka is recovering from conflict and making the transition to peace and stability. \nADB's disaster policy modifies the prevailing ADF lending terms approved by the ADB Board so \nthey are appropriate for disaster, emergency, and post-conflict assistance. The disaster policy \ncovers post-conflict assistance and provides that emergency assistance loans are to cover \nshort-term  immediate  needs  including  rehabilitation  of  priority  water,  transport,  and  other \ninfrastructure, to regenerate livelihoods and boost productivity, and revitalize social services, \namong other things (footnote 9). The ADF loan would be extended to Sri Lanka to cover a \nportion of the remaining unfunded immediate term needs identified in the 2003 post-conflict \nneeds assessment and still unmet (refer to paragraph 12 for the description of these needs), \nincluding  rehabilitation  of  priority  infrastructure,  regeneration  of  livelihoods,  boosting ", "30 \nproductivity, and revitalizing social services. It is proposed that the loan from ADF be made on \nconcessional terms permitted under ADB's disaster policy, and the same as the Approved \nLoans. The term of the loan will be 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years, with a \nrepayment of principal at 2% per year for the first 10 years after the grace period and 4% a year \nthereafter, to be paid semiannually, with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum.  \n \n2.  ADF Grant \n \n115.  The Board of Governors of ADB resolved to establish a new grant program during the \nAsian Development Fund IX Annual Meeting, under the ADF IX resolution42. Donors agreed that \nADF grants could be used to assist poor countries make the transition from post-conflict to \npeace and stability, as well as for HIV/AIDS prevention. Sri Lanka was identified as one of the \npost-conflict countries and eligible for ADF grants43. The post-conflict situation in the North East \nof  Sri  Lanka  qualifies  Sri  Lanka  for  such  ADF  grant  funding.  In  addition,  the  HIV/AIDS \nsubcomponent qualifies for ADF grant financing, although, as it is not a large subcomponent, \nwill be financed through the post-conflict country allocation of the ADF grant.  \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n116.  NECORD-II will be implemented using the same process approach and implementation \narrangements  as  NECORD  that  are  already  working  successfully.  NECORD\u2019s  PMU  in \nTrincomalee will be strengthened and maintained for the duration of NECORD-II. The PMU will \nbe headed by the project director, who will have direct responsibility for implementing NECORD-\nII, through the existing provincial and central government sector agencies, and for ensuring that \nthe  essential  balances  among  communities  are  monitored  and  maintained.  The  PMU  will \nmanage and coordinate subprojects through existing structures and procedures at provincial, \ndistrict, and division levels. The PMU will act as the secretariat for NPCC and PPCC. The PMU \nmay engage suitably qualified and acceptable international and domestic NGOs to manage \nspecific NECORD-II activities in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB. District project \nmanagement units (DPMUs) established in each district under NECORD will continue to closely \nmonitor the implementation of district subprojects and report to the PMU. A deputy project \ndirector,  who  will  directly  implement  smaller-scale subprojects  at  the  district  and  divisional \nlevels, will head each DPMU. \n \n117.  Given the complexity and sensitivity of NECORD-II and the need for close coordination \nwith the actors in the North East\u2014the Government, LTTE, external assistance agencies, NGOs, \nand others\u2014NECORD-II will be administered through the ADB Resident Mission in Colombo.  \n \n2.  Selection and Approval of Subprojects \n \n118.  Subprojects will be selected to ensure equitable distribution of rehabilitation activities \nacross all the conflict-affected districts\u2014taking into account geographic and sector balances \nalong with the ethnic composition\u2014to maximize benefits in the affected areas and, equally \nimportant, to not contribute to the intercommunal tensions that led to the conflict. NECORD-II \n                                                 \n42 Eighth Replenishment of the Asian Development Fund and Third Regularized Replenishment of the Technical \nAssistance Special Fund\" (ADF IX Resolution) \n43 Paragraph 24 of the ADF Staff Instructions Program, November 2004. ADF grants are not to exceed 15% of Sri \nLanka\u2019s program.  \n  ", "  31\nsubprojects will be identified and selected in accordance with sector-specific criteria agreed \nupon by the Government and ADB, as presented in Appendix 5b. In addition, regardless of the \nsector, each subproject proposal will be selected on the basis of the general criteria set forth in \npara. 70, except that such criteria will be defined in terms of conflict affected people and conflict-\naffected areas, rather than in terms of the tsunami.  \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n \n119.  Like  TAARP,  NECORD-II  will  be  implemented  over  a  4-year  period.  This  period  is \nneeded because of the geographic distribution and extent of damage caused by the 20-year \nconflict, the time required to formulate and package subprojects and civil works contracts, the \nnecessity for community consultation and mobilization, the potential need for clearance of mines \nand unexploded ordnance, and the limitations of still evolving institutions. Capacity building at \nthe various implementing departments and the construction industry in the North East has \nbegun\u2014in part through the NECORD subprojects already completed\u2014but the need for further \ncapacity building remains. Contractor capacity has been strengthened in the North East through \na series of construction and contracting seminars presented in 2004 by Deutsche Gesellschaft \nf\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) and  ADB.  Equally important, the conflict destroyed \nmuch of the human capacity in the area, in the Government, NGOs, and the private sector. \nNECORD-II will continue the essential but time- and resource-consuming task of rebuilding this \ncapacity.  The  existing  national  project  coordinating  committee  and  provincial  project \ncoordinating committee will continue to operate under NECORD-II. The scheduled completion \ndate is 30 June 2009, the same as for TAARP (Appendix 11).  \n \n4.  Social and Environmental Measures \n \n120.  Like TAARP, NECORD-II is not expected to require land acquisition or resettlement; only \nvacant  state-owned  land  will  be  used  for  subproject  improvements.  Reconstruction  and \nrehabilitation will typically take place at existing locations. Works will be designed to ensure that \nimprovements will be within existing property boundaries. If constructed, cluster-housing units \nfor teachers will be located only at or adjacent to existing education facilities, on unencumbered \ngovernment land. A summary resettlement framework as presented in Appendix 12, has been \nagreed upon by the Government and ADB to address any unanticipated land acquisition or \ninvoluntary resettlement that may arise during NECORD-II. Refer to paragraph 72 above. \n \n121.  Like TAARP (para. 73), NECORD-II will focus on rehabilitation and reconstruction of \npreexisting  infrastructure  damaged  as  a  result  of  the  conflict,  and  is  also  classified  as \nenvironmental category B. No subprojects classified as category A by ADB will be financed \nunder  NECORD-II.  A  summary  IEE  is  presented  in  Appendix 13.  Subprojects  will  follow \nenvironmental assessment procedures stipulated in the environmental assessment framework \nattached as Appendix 14. While NECORD-II may lead to temporary and reversible localized \nnegative  impacts,  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  foreseen.  The \nenvironmental assessment framework has been developed to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002) and the Government\u2019s environmental regulations.  \n \n122.  The indigenous Veddas may also be affected by NECORD-II. In the event of their \ninvolvement  in  any  subprojects,  all  necessary  actions  required  under  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998) and the IPDF will be taken, as similarly detailed for TAARP in para. \n74. A summary IPDF is presented in Appendix 15.  \n \n ", "32 \n5.  Procurement of Civil Works and Equipment \n \n123.  Procurement of goods and services under NECORD-II will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and the Government\u2019s tender procedures acceptable to \nADB. ADB\u2019s disaster policy permits flexible interpretation of these guidelines, so that project \nactivities can start promptly.  \n \n124.  For civil works contracts with estimated values greater than $5 million, procurement will \nbe  in  accordance  with  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  For  contracts  with \nestimated  values  of  $5 million  and  below,  procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  local \ncompetitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Local  procurement  will  be  the \npreferred mode for most NECORD-II activities because of the relatively short implementation \nperiod, the relatively small size of most contract packages, the wide geographic spread of the \nsubproject sites, and the need for local awareness of security and other frequently changing \nmatters relevant to the North East. Contracts with estimated values less than $100,000 will be \nprocured under LCB using post-facto approval procedures, as is currently typical for NECORD. \nLCB civil works procurement will include single-stage, two-envelope procedures where relevant, \nand bidding periods of at least 21 days.  \n \n125.  Equipment and materials will be procured under international competitive bidding where \nthe estimated cost is more than $500,000 equivalent, by international shopping where the \nestimated cost is between $300,000 and $500,000 equivalent, and through local procurement \nprocedures acceptable to ADB where the estimated cost is $300,000 equivalent or less. Minor \nitems costing less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured through direct purchase.  \n \n126.  The Government has requested ADB\u2019s approval of advance action for procurement of \ncivil works, including inviting and receiving bids for contracts, for subprojects that might be \napproved for implementation prior to loan effectiveness. The Government has been advised that \nADB\u2019s approval of advance action would not commit ADB to financing NECORD-II.  \n \n6.  Consulting Services \n \n127.  The  existing  consultants  for  NECORD,  who  are  providing  support  for  procurement, \ncontract management, and training, will extend their services through direct selection to cover \nthe additional requirements of NECORD-II. For new services, primarily for accounting and \ngeneral  engineering,  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. Consultants will be provided individually and through \nfirms. Individual consultants will assist in the preparation of gender-oriented economic activities \nand business cooperatives. NGOs will assist during implementation of village and community \ndevelopment  subprojects.  NECORD-II  will  require  approximately  200  person-months  of \ndomestic  consulting  services.  Sample  outline  terms  of  reference  for  potential  consultant \nassignments are provided in Appendix 16.  \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n128.  Disbursement  arrangements  will  follow  the  existing  fund  flow  and  disbursement \narrangements  established  and  working  well  at  the  existing  NECORD  PMU  and  DPMUs. \nDetailed disbursements arrangements for NECORD-II are in Appendix 17.  \n \n \n  ", "  33\n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n129.  The MRRR, NEPC, and the PMU will maintain separate records and accounts for the \nloan and grant adequate to identify financing resources received and expenditures made for \nNECORD-II, including goods, works, and services financed by loan, grant, and local funds. \nThese project accounts and related financial statements will be audited annually in accordance \nwith  sound  auditing  standards  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Provision  for \nfinancial auditing costs has been included in the cost estimate and will be financed through \nNECORD-II.  The  Government  will  submit  annual  audited  reports  and  related  financial \nstatements to ADB within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. The audit of imprest \naccounts, second-generation imprest accounts, third-generation imprest accounts, and SOE will \nbe carried out as part of the annual audit, with the auditor\u2019s opinion of each separately set out in \nthe auditor\u2019s report. Like for TAARP, financial audits provided in 6 months by private sector \nauditors may be provided in advance of the Sri Lankan Auditor General\u2019s statutory audited \naccounts, and if there is any discrepancy, ADB and Sri Lanka will consult on the reasons for this \nand next steps to be followed.  \n \n130.  The PMU currently prepares brief progress reports for NECORD each month. NECORD-\nII activities will be similarly reported in separate monthly reports. Completion reports, which \nidentify the impact of activities, will be prepared for each subproject. Within 3 months of the \nphysical completion of NECORD-II, the Government will furnish to ADB an overall project \ncompletion report providing a detailed evaluation of the project design, costs, contractor and \nconsultant performance, social and economic impact, and other details as may be requested by \nADB.  \n \n131.  As required by the disaster policy, supervision and monitoring of NECORD-II has been \nenhanced to ensure quality and effectiveness at a time when the Government\u2019s financial and \nhuman resources are extended (footnote 37). Procurement specialists will help the National \nProcurement  Agency  to  expedite  civil  works  and  equipment  procurement  procedures  and \nrefining guidelines. In addition, independent auditors, CSOs, or NGOs will conduct semiannual \nperformance audits during implementation, to determine the degree to which NECORD-II funds \nhave been effectively and efficiently utilized during implementation, and whether objectives, \noutputs, and performance indicators have been achieved. The final performance audit (to be \nconducted after completion) will focus on governance, financial accountability, and transparency \n(footnote 38). Provision has been included in the cost estimates to cover performance auditing \nthroughout implementation. The Government will be responsible for covering the cost of the final \npost completion performance audit.  \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n \n132.  For activities where subprojects are formulated and designed during implementation, \nbaseline indicators and targets for each subproject, including the socioeconomic conditions of \nthe  beneficiaries,  will  be  included  as  part  of  the  subproject  proposal.  The  management \ninformation system developed for NECORD\u2014in accordance with ADB\u2019s project performance \nmanagement evaluation system\u2014will be updated and used to monitor subproject benefits and \nimpacts for NECORD-II.  \n \n10.  Project Review \n \n133.  NECORD-II will be regularly reviewed by the Resident Mission (at least once every 6 \nmonths) throughout project implementation. There will also be quarterly reviews as part of the ", "34 \noverall portfolio review. Resident Mission staff will attend NPCC and PPCC meetings in the \nNorth East to consider and approve subprojects for implementation. Given the complexities of \nimplementation involved and considering the 4-year implementation period, a midterm review \nwill be carried out after 2 years, around June 2007, for which the Government will submit to \nADB a detailed progress report on the implementation and achievement of NECORD-II.  \n \n \nV.  PROJECTS\u2019 BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Projects\u2019 Benefits and Impacts \n \n134.  The vast majority of the people directly affected by the tsunami disaster were at the \nlower end of the economic scale,44 partly because the districts affected tended to have high \nlevels of poverty at the time of the disaster and partly because people who lived in substandard \nhousing were less able to resist the onslaught of the waves. In the conflict-affected North East, \npoverty levels are estimated to be 60%\u201390%, much higher than in the rest of the country, \nalthough there are gaps in government surveys for much of the area. For both tsunami- and \nconflict-affected  people,  basic  socioeconomic  facilities  need  to  be  restored  if  affected \ncommunities are to recover and begin the long climb back to normalcy. A summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is provided as Appendix 18.  \n \n135.  These projects together will address the urgent needs of about 3 million people, among \nwhich the physically disabled, single heads of households and children feature significantly. By \nrestoring sectors that form the backbone of the economy in the affected areas, NECORD-II will \nhelp to rebuild affected communities, and to stabilize the economic base of local populations, \nhelping people to move from dependency on government support to sustainable livelihoods.  \n \n136.  TAARP and NECORD-II focus on restoring preexisting facilities, allowing for technical \nimprovements  and  future  demand,  based  on  a  least-cost  approach.  TAARP  also  aims  to \nstrengthen the coastal environment. Taking into consideration the long years of neglect, project \ninterventions focus not only on the physical rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure but also on \nthe  restoration  of  the  physical  and  institutional  arrangements  for  legal,  administrative  and \ntechnical services.  \n \n137.  Creating an environment that is conducive for vulnerable and marginalized groups in the \nconflict- and tsunami-affected areas to participate in reconstruction activities is an urgent need. \nConflict widows, wives of the \u201cdisappeared,\u201d single heads of households, and widowers have to \ndeal with transformations in social roles that place new burdens on them. Helping them to \nbecome economically independent and to improve the well-being of their families involves \nreduce existing inequalities and discrimination. To this end, a gender action plan is presented in \nAppendix 19.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n44  Statistics on families affected have not yet been disaggregated according to income levels. This assertion is based \non impressions gathered during several ADB field trips to the affected areas and on monitoring reports by various \naid agencies. Poverty levels in the affected districts are higher than the national average (head count ratio of \n22.7%) with a head count ratio of over 35% in each of the Southern districts (Galle 26%, Matara 27% and \nHambantota 32%). Poverty statistics are not available for the North East, but can be expected to be higher due to \nthe 20-year conflict.  \n  ", "  35\nB.  Assumptions, Risks, and Mitigants  \n \n138.  The design of TAARP and NECORD-II incorporates a number of safeguards to improve \nand strengthen governance and institutional capacity of the EAs, the IAs, and the PMUs.  \n \n139.  There  is  a  risk  that  either  or  both  projects  may  not  be  sustainable.  However,  the \nGovernment\u2019s contribution is primarily through reallocation of existing budget provision and \nplanned  budgetary  allocation  for  the  NECORD-II  project,  therefore  the  additional  finances \nrequired are limited. Further, given the situation after the tsunami, Government financing is \nlimited to incremental expenditures, duties and taxes; all other components of both projects are \n100% financed by other sources, so, except for the loan of $26 million for NECORD-II, there is \nno increase in the debt burden. Except for component A of TAARP, TAARP and NECORD-II are \nbeing implemented through PMUs established under existing loan agreements; additional staff \nare  being  provided  through  grant  resources.  New  subprojects  must  satisfy  financial \nsustainability  criteria,  and,  as  both  projects  involve  replacing  old,  and  in  some  cases, \ndepreciated assets, there is a possibility of incremental operations and maintenance savings. \nTAARP and NECORD-II are therefore deemed to be financially sustainable.  \n \n140.  In responding to the tsunami, Sri Lanka\u2019s financial and human capacities are being \nstrained. The volume and scale of tsunami-related foreign assistance being provided to Sri \nLanka could lead to governance, corruption, and administration of justice issues. The size of \npublic  and  private  contributions  to  Sri  Lanka  may  exceed  the  current  capacity  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  public  administration  and  justice  systems  to  manage  the  funds,  leaving \nopportunities for individuals and public officials to take advantage of the large influx of funds and \nvulnerable people.  \n \n141.  Factors mitigating governance and corruption risks include detailed subproject selection \ncriteria, transparent implementation and monitoring mechanisms, specific financial controls and \nregular  and  random  audits.  Additional  budget  provisions  for  supervision  and  monitoring, \nparticularly by Resident Mission staff will also serve to strengthen governance controls. In \naddition, the Government\u2019s capacity for procurement, financial management, supervision and \nmonitoring has been assessed and will be further strengthened through TAARP. In addition to \nthe usual submission of annual audited reports and related financial statements to ADB, regular \nand random supervision and monitoring reviews will be undertaken. Provision has been made in \nboth projects for independent annual financial audits and regular performance  audits. The \nResident Mission is also strengthening its ability to supervise and provide guidance and training \nto PMUs. A decentralized system of private dispute resolution, and public grievance review, will \nbe established under TAARP to investigate and resolve any private disputes or claims of \nimpropriety against public officials relating to tsunami assistance. Manual systems of document \nstorage and retrieval for personal identity documents will be modernized to minimize risks of \nfalse claims and corruption. Publication of tsunami assistance, procurement, and tsunami policy \nmatters in all three languages (Sinhala, Tamil and English), in government newspapers and on \na  web-site,  will  provide  the  public  with  information  and  so  improve  transparency  and \naccountability. Legal assistance will be provided to tsunami-affected people to enable them to \navail of their legal entitlements for good governance, and to minimize disputes.  \n \n142.  Provision of significant assistance to tsunami-affected people can produce tensions if it \nis perceived that different parts of the country or ethnic groups are receiving more than their fair \nshare of reconstruction funds, or if other people who are in poverty or internally displaced feel \nthey  are  being  forgotten.  As  a  result,  social  tensions  and  conflict  can  actually  increase, \nundermining implementation of reconstruction.  ", "36 \n143.  The peace and conflict impact assessment is available as Supplementary Appendix D. \nBy fitting in the general framework of the national reconstruction plan, both projects will ensure \nthat overall allocation of funds to the affected areas follows reconstruction needs and that the \nsame  criteria  and  policies  are  applied  to  tsunami-  and  conflict-affected  areas.  In  addition, \nsubproject selection will ensure that the beneficial outcomes are shared equitably among the \nmajor ethnic groups and across the target area. Both projects will make a positive contribution \nto strengthening the socioeconomic fabric of the affected areas by rebuilding key infrastructure. \nEquity  and  conflict  resolution  will  be  pursued  through  (i) selection  of  communities  and \nsubprojects to ensure an ethnic balance that reasonably reflects the general ethnic composition \nof the affected areas; (ii) consultation with all major stakeholders regarding the final choice of \nsubprojects;  and  (iii) consistent  application  of  the  principle  of  subsidiarity,  to  ensure  that \nrecovery decisions are taken as close as possible to the affected populations, with their active \ninvolvement as stakeholders in the process.  \n \n144.  The bureaucratic application of normal implementation procedures could result in delays \nin the rehabilitation and reconstruction of tsunami-affected areas. Disputes relating to property \nrights caused by loss of title documents, shifting of shorelines, occupation of private lands by \nsquatters, elimination of property boundaries, and resettlement of displaced people may also \ncause delays.  \n \n145.  To address these risks, ADB is assisting the National Procurement Agency to simplify \nthe emergency procurement guidelines and the procurement guidelines for Sri Lanka. TAARP \nwill engage consultants to support procurement and the planning and evaluation of subprojects, \nas requested by the Government. Existing PMUs will be used to implement the project, avoiding \nthe time needed to establish new ones. They will be strengthened by adding capacity to ensure \nno  delays  in  implementation  or  processing  of  payments.  Retroactive  financing  has  been \nincluded so urgent activities can be funded. The legal assistance and governance measures \nmentioned above will minimize the risk of legal and documentary related disputes.  \n \n146.  Another risk is that, once a period of time has passed, the national Government or \nprovincial and local governments may not maintain sufficient commitment to implement both \nprojects in an efficient and timely manner.  \n \n147.  The Government has established TAFREN, involving high-caliber members from private \nand public sectors. It is preparing a bill to be submitted to parliament to transform TAFREN into \nan Authority that will coordinate reconstruction over a 3 to 5 year period. Reconstruction under \nTAARP  will  be  undertaken  within  this  national  framework,  while  special  mechanisms  and \nagreements are being developed for affected districts in the North East, to ensure participation \nand commitment by all stakeholders.  \n \n148.  Competition  among  donors  offering  assistance  and  insufficient  coordination  in  the \nprovision of assistance could lead to gaps or overlaps in sector or geographic coverage, poor \ndelivery of needed benefits to tsunami-affected people, or the application of different policies or \nstandards in different areas.  \n \n149.  A  good  climate  for  cooperation  has  been  established  through  the  tsunami  needs \nassessment. In the second phase of the assessment, which is focusing on implementation \nmechanisms  and  coordination,  the  steering  group  has  been  expanded  to  include  bilateral \ndevelopment partners, NGOs, and the private sector. While coordinating the international NGOs \nthat have raised large cash contributions will be a challenge, a good basis for cooperation has \nbeen laid. The Government is leading the second phase of the needs assessment, and has \n  ", "  37\nindicated its intention to play a strong role in coordination, including listing all significant projects \non the TAFREN website. ADB, JBIC, and the World Bank are working closely together, taking \nturns to chair reconstruction-related meetings. ADB and the World Bank have explicitly declared \nthat they will make their reconstruction operations flexible, in order to play a \u201cgap-filling\u201d role to \ncomplement other development partners.  \n \n150.  Price escalation is a risk. An increase in the demand for construction materials in an \nalready constrained supply environment could lead to price escalation and dramatically affect \nthe amount of reconstruction that can be carried out under either project. An adequate supply of \nconstruction  materials  (sand,  cement,  reinforcing  steel)  must  be  readily  accessible  to  the \nconstruction industry, in particular in the North East, where there is already a large construction \nprogram underway.  \n \n151.  The  possibility  of  rising  prices  has  been  raised  in  a  number  of  meetings  with  the \nGovernment, and mitigating measures are being designed. Selective import liberalization and \nspreading  implementation  over  a  longer  period  (up  to  4  years,  depending  on  urgency  of \ninterventions) will help to smooth out pressures on supply.  \n \n \nVI.  SPECIFIC ASSURANCES \n \n152.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  relevant  to  both  TAARP  and \nNECORD-II, in addition to the standard assurances. These have been incorporated into the \nlegal documents.  \n \n(i)  Continuity and integration. The Government will ensure the continuity of the \nimplementation of NECORD and NECORD \u2013 Extension on the one hand, and \nComponent H of TAARP and NECORD-II on the other, and will ensure the \nintegration of the implementation of NECORD-II and Component H of TAARP. \n \n(ii)  Government administration. The project management arrangements reflect the \npresent  Government  administrative  structure  that  may  change  during \nimplementation. The Government will immediately notify ADB of any proposed \nchange in the administrative structure in the project areas, and take all steps \nnecessary to ensure that the project management arrangements are revised in \nconsultation with ADB to reflect the new administrative structure and protect the \nviability of the Project(s). The Government will take all steps necessary and \nwithin its power to ensure that any successor project management entities enter \ninto  such  project  agreements,  or  other  agreements  with  ADB,  as  ADB  may \nrequest.  \n \n(iii)  Peace building and community reconciliation. The Government will ensure \nthat  all  conflict-related  project  interventions  contribute  to  peace  building  and \ncommunity reconciliation, and that all tsunami-related project interventions either \ncontribute  to,  or  do  not  detract  from,  peace  building  and  community \nreconciliation. If any intervention has an actual or threatened negative impact on \npeace  building  and  community,  the  Government  agrees  that  ADB  shall  be \nentitled to determine whether such intervention should be continued, redesigned, \nsuspended, or cancelled.  \n ", "38 \n(iv)  Access. The Government will ensure that staff, consultants, materials, vehicles, \nequipment, and other items required for project implementation, will be given \nreasonable access to project areas.  \n \n(v)  Operation and maintenance. The Government will ensure, and will cause the \nexecuting  agencies,  and  implementing  agencies  to  ensure,  that  the  facilities \nprovided under the Project are operated and maintained, and that adequate \nbudgetary and other resources are provided for this purpose. The Government \nwill also ensure that community-based organizations charged with operating and \nmaintaining  facilities  provided  under  both  projects  are  provided  with  the \nnecessary support and training to undertake such activities.  \n \n(vi)  Subproject selection. The Government and  each Implementing Agency will \nensure  that  all  subprojects  meet  to  ADB\u2019s  satisfaction,  the  agreed  selection \ncriteria  and  other  implementation  arrangements,  and  that  subprojects  are \ncontrolled and monitored to ADB\u2019s satisfaction.  \n \n(vii)  Governance and anticorruption. The Government and ADB agree to adopt a \npolicy of zero-tolerance of corruption in relation to assistance provided under the \nProject(s), and by development partners. The Government will take measures to \nquickly sanction private individuals, entities, or public officials who actually, or \nattempt to take advantage of donor funds, or the loss of documents, such as the \nabsence of property title documents, court records, or bank accounts.  \n \n(viii)  SOE audit. The Government agrees to ensure that ADB staff are granted access \nto key books and records in order to complete an SOE audit within 6 months of \neffectiveness.  \n \n(ix)  Performance  audits.  The  Government  will,  and  will  cause  each  Executing \nAgency or Implementing Agency to, engage private sector auditors, civil society \norganizations  (CSOs),  or  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  to  conduct \nsemiannual performance audits during Project implementation, to determine the \ndegree to which Project funds have been effectively and efficiently utilized to \nimplement the Project, and achieved its objectives, outputs, and performance \nindicators. In addition, the Government will ensure that a special post completion \nperformance  audit  is  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  disaster  and \nemergency  policy  to  consider  governance,  transparency,  and  financial \naccountability.  \n \n(x)  ADB monitoring and compliance. The Government will allow and facilitate \nADB\u2019s representatives to conduct spot and random checks on (a) flow of funds \nthrough the imprest account, each second-generation imprest account, and each \nthird-generation imprest account, and their use for the project in accordance with \nthe financing agreement, (b) work-in-progress; and (c) project implementation. \n \n(xi)  Participation. The Government will ensure, or will cause each Executing Agency \nor  Implementing  Agency  to  ensure  that  CSOs,  NGOs,  and  beneficiaries  are \ninvolved in subproject selection, design, implementation, and monitoring.  \n \n153.  In addition, the Government has given the following assurances for TAARP, in addition \nto the standard assurances, which have been incorporated into the legal documents.  \n  ", "  39\n \n(i)  Bribery and Corruption commission. Sri Lanka shall strengthen Sri Lanka\u2019s \nCommission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption established to \ninvestigate, and address potential corruption or irregularities related to tsunami-\nassistance that may include establishing a division under the director-general of \nthe Bribery and Corruption Commission or regional offices in tsunami affected \nareas, in order to investigate, and respond to, allegations of corruption in relation \nto Tsunami assistance.  \n \n(ii)  Guiding principles and governance. In furtherance of the Guiding Principles of \nthe  Recovery  Strategy  (2005),  which  include  communication,  transparency, \nconsultation, and zero tolerance for corruption, Sri Lanka shall, in conjunction \nwith ADB, do the following:  \n \n(a)  establish  an  internet web-site  that  describes  or  has  links  to Tsunami \nassistance and the administration of funds under Tsunami assistance \nprojects, to provide the public with information to ensure that funds are \nused for intended beneficiaries and purposes (the Tsunami Web-Site) \nand have such information published in Sinhala, Tamil and English, in Sri \nLanka\u2019s government newspapers; \n \n(b)  issue  or  reissue  identification  cards  to  tsunami-affected  people  and \nbusinesses  that  they  shall  be  required  to  use  to  obtain  tsunami \nassistance; and  \n \n(c)  provide  information  concerning  tsunami-affected  people  and/or \ncommunities that shall receive tsunami assistance, and information for \neach contract to be procured TAARP (1) on the Tsunami Web Site, (2) in \na readily accessible public place in each tsunami-affected area, which \nmay be in each PMU office; and (3) by publishing such information in \nSinhala, Tamil and English in Sri Lanka\u2019s government newspapers. \n \n(iii)  Review of ADB project portfolio and disaster standards. The Government, \nthe EA concerned and ADB agree to complete, within 6 months of the completion \nof the second phase of the tsunami needs assessment, a review of the active \nprojects in ADB\u2019s portfolio of projects in Sri Lanka to assess their design and \noperational methods in light of the needs assessment, in particular to consider \nhow they could be improved to better avoid, or mitigate, against other natural \ndisasters, and where appropriate to identify changes in the relevant project.  \n \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n154.  I am satisfied that the proposed emergency loans and grants would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of ADB and, acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions \nof Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board approve the \nfollowing:  \n \n(i)  a loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 4,553,000 from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources reallocated from the following three projects:  \n ", "40 \n(a)  Loan 1462-SRI(SF): North Central Province Rural Development Project;  \n(b)  Loan 1757-SRI(SF): Water Resources Management Project; and  \n(c)  Loan 1913-SRI(SF): Plantation Development Project;  \n \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Tsunami-affected Areas \nRebuilding Project, with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum, and \nrepayment of principal at 2% per annum for the first 10 years after the grace \nperiod and 4% per annum thereafter; a term of 40 years, including a grace period \nof  10  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Financing Agreement and Project \nAgreement presented to the Board: in addition, the total amount of interest during \nthe grace period will be capitalized;  \n \n(ii)  the grant of $150 million to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the \nTsunami-affected Areas Rebuilding Project from ADB\u2019s Asian Tsunami Fund on \nterms and conditions substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nFinancing  Agreement  and  draft  Project  Agreement  presented  to  the  Board; \nprovided that any withdrawal in excess of $75,000,000 shall be subject to the \navailability of the Asian Tsunami Fund resources;  \n \n(iii)  the administration by ADB of a grant not exceeding the equivalent of \u20ac40 million \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Tsunami-Affected Areas \nRebuilding Project, to be provided by the European Commission on a grant basis \nsubject to the condition that the proposal, set out in paragraphs 80 and 81 of this \nReport, that the Board approve by a vote of the Directors representing not less \nthan two thirds of the total voting power of the members, that goods and services \nprocured from member countries of the European Union be eligible for financing \nunder  component  C  of  the  Tsunami-affected  Areas  Rebuilding  Project,  is \napproved.

Overall incremental financing needs resulting from tsunami damage or destruction are \nestimated at $1.5 billion\u2013$1.6 billion. This is in addition to the $200 million\u2013$300 million that the \nGovernment estimates it has already spent, and excludes further relief expenditures. In the \nshort term, most resources are required for housing, transportation infrastructure, and livelihood \nrestoration for fishers, small farmers, small and microenterprises, and others. Recovery needs \nrun parallel to the level of damage, with some variation, depending upon the recovery strategy \nand its intent to replace damaged assets with those of equal value, as in housing and health, or \nwith upgrades to services and infrastructure, as in power, water supply and sanitation, and \ntransportation (especially railways).  \n \nTable A2.1: Preliminary Estimates of Losses and Financing Needs  \n($ million) \n  Losses  Financing Needs \n  Asset  Output  Short  Medium   Total  \nSector  Loss  Lossd  Term  Term  Needs \nHousing  306\u2013341  \u2013  50  387\u2013437  437\u2013487 \nRoads  60  \u2013  25  175  200 \nWater and Sanitation  42  \u2013  64  53  117 \nRailways  15  \u2013  40  90  130 \nEducation  26  \u2013  13  32  45 \nHealth  60  \u2013  17  67  84 \nAgriculture a  3  \u2013  2  2  4 \nFisheries a  97  200  69  49  118 \nTourism a  250  130  130  0  130 \nPower  10  \u2013  27  40\u201350  67\u201377 \nEnvironment  10  \u2013  6  12  18 \nSocial Welfare b  \u2013  \u2013  30  0  30 \nExcluded Items plus \n90    30  120  150 \nContingency c \n  Total (Rounded)  970\u20131,000  330  500  1,000\u20131,100  1,500\u20131,600 \nPercent of Gross Domestic \n4.4\u20134.6  1.5      7.0\u20137.3 \nProduct \n\u2013 = not applicable. \na Includes estimates from livelihoods damage assessment of fishermen, small farmers, and small businesses in \ntourism, totaling $140 million. \nb Targeted assistance to vulnerable groups. \nc Estimated at about 10% of the total. \nd Refers to 2005 and 2006. \nSource: Government of Sri Lanka and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n2.

Damage and Needs by Region \n \n3.  Figures A2.1 and A2.2 provide a regional breakdown of the estimated post-tsunami \nfinancing needs in Sri Lanka. This first does not include the tourism sector,1 since it is likely to \nget financing from the private banking and insurance sectors and, therefore, is not considered \ndependent on aid. The second provides the full picture of required financing from all sources. \nThe east is the most heavily affected area, accounting for well over 40% of the financing needs. \nThe Galle district is very heavily impacted, and close to 30% of the financing needs under either \ndefinition are in the Southern Province.

The allocation of domestic and international resources should be strictly guided by the \nidentified  needs  and  local  priorities,  without  political,  religious,  ethnic,  or  gender \ndiscrimination. The recovery strategy should take into account the extent of progress in Sri \nLanka  since  the  signing  of  the  cease-fire  agreement,  after  a  long  conflict,  and  seek  to \nstrengthen the peace process. Reconstruction interventions should build confidence between \ndifferent actors in the process. Reconstruction should similarly be sensitive to the impact on \nneighboring but unaffected communities.  \n \n2.  The strategy should be based on the principle of subsidiarity: each reconstruction \nactivity should be designed and implemented at the lowest competent tier of government. While \nthe central Government should lead in setting standards, policies, and principles, subsidiarity \nallows for locally appropriate solutions and enables a range of subnational structures and \norganizations  to  be  directly  engaged  in  the  process.  The  recovery  plan  (which  should  be \ndisaggregated to district level) will provide for capacity building and strengthening at various \nlevels of governance, but especially in the districts and pradeshiya sabhas,1 as well as local \ncivil-society organizations.  \n \n3.  The  recovery  strategy  should  focus  on  the  victims\u2019  medium-  and  long-term  needs. \nTherefore, enhanced and solid consultation with affected communities and stakeholders is \nessential, and communities should be empowered to make their own decisions during recovery \nand participate fully in reconstruction activities. All interventions need to respond to clearly \nidentified and articulated needs of communities, respecting their religion, culture, structures, and \ncustoms.  This  is  especially  important  with  respect  to  the  policies  related  to  shelter  and \nrelocation, which should not proceed without such full consultation. Communities should be \nassisted to return to their original homes as swiftly as possible. To maximize the speed of \nrecovery, local capacities should be harnessed as far as possible.  \n \n4.  Better  communication  and  transparency  are  needed  in  decision  making  and \nimplementation. Mechanisms should be strengthened to ensure access to information regarding \npolicies, entitlements, and implementation procedures, and to permit more regular feedback to \nimplementing  authorities,  as  well  as  grievance  redress.  Similarly,  mechanisms  to  ensure \ntransparency in resource use and comprehensive accounting need to be enhanced, at the \naggregate, program, and beneficiary levels, accompanied by more effective monitoring and \nevaluation  systems,  to  permit  a  full  accounting  to  Parliament,  development  partners,  civil \nsociety, and the affected communities of resources deployed from all sources. All parties should \nreaffirm their policy of zero tolerance for corruption in this joint effort.  \n \n5.  Reconstruction processes should reduce vulnerability to natural hazards, including \nfloods,  cyclones,  and  landslides.  A  multi-hazard  risk  approach  should  be  used  during  the \nrecovery  phase  to  ensure  that  communities  and  assets  are  less  vulnerable  to  impacts  of \ndisasters, while balancing the social costs of excessive resettlement. It should be guided by \ninternational standards and best practices in design and asset management.  \n \n6.  All the above considerations suggest a number of factors that will need to be built into \nthe analysis of individual interventions. They should be analyzed for their potential impact on \nthe cease-fire and the prospects for peace. For long-term sustainability, such interventions \nshould incorporate governance, gender sensitivity, environment, resettlement and land issues, \n                                                 \n1  Local government authority responsible for planning and maintenance at the community level.  ", "Appendix 3  55\nand human rights concerns. The process should be guided by international standards and best \npractice for protection, with special attention to the needs of vulnerable groups.  \n \n7.  If debt relief is granted to Sri Lanka as part of the financing package, it would be \nespecially important to deploy the resources transparently and to carefully monitor their use.  \n \n8.  A coordinated approach is critical to ensure that the above principles are followed and \nto prevent duplication or overlap in activities. Development partners should minimize the burden \non the overextended Government, not least by maximizing their own coordination. Coordination \nshould not just be between Government and donors but involve all stakeholders, including civil \nsociety, the business community, and international nongovernment organizations, which have \nresources that will not pass through the Government. Local capacity would need to be created \nfor such coordination.  \n ", "56  Appendix 4 \nCOORDINATION OF EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE FOR POST-TSUNAMI RECONSTRUCTION \n \n1.  During the early days after the tsunami struck Sri Lanka on 26 December, a large \namount of assistance was spontaneously offered by individuals, nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs), and the private sector. This included persons supplying food to and housing neighbors; \ncorporations taking charge of organizing and supplying camps for people displaced by the \ntsunami, and domestic and international NGOs along with agencies from the United Nations \n(UN)  system  mobilizing  large  amounts  of  supplies,  food,  water,  and  other  necessities. \nCoordination was made difficult by the large number of agencies and organizations involved, \nand by size of the affected area. The UN system helped greatly in establishing the Center for \nNational Operations, which coordinates the logistics and other dimensions of the relief effort.  \n \n2.  The Government issued on 11 January a preliminary assessment of the casualties, \ndamage, and reconstruction needs. It requested that international financial institutions such as \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  World  Bank,  and  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation (JBIC) jointly assess these needs to verify the Government estimates. Following a \njoint mission from 10 to 25 April 2005, during which each agency focused on a few sectors \n(roads, railways, and livelihoods for ADB; education, health, and housing for the World Bank; \nand  power,  telecommunications,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation  for  JBIC)  drafts  of  this \nmultidonor assessment were circulated on 28 January and 2 February 2005. Shortly after, the \nLiberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam issued a draft assessment of damage in the North East. \nInterestingly, the three estimates were of the same order of magnitude, estimating total damage \nat $1.5 billion\u2013$1.6 billion, more of it outside the southern and western provinces.  \n \n3.  The  next  steps  implemented  during  February  and  March  included  (i)  a  number  of \nconsultations with all stakeholders to reconcile the different estimates on the basis of common \ntechnical criteria, so that the Government could issue a revised needs assessment acceptable \nto all parties; (ii) a second phase of district-level consultations carried out by mixed teams \nrepresenting the Government, external development partners, and local stakeholders, to ensure \na consultative process in designing implementation mechanisms for reconstruction; and (iii) \nenlargement of the development partner group to include bilateral donors, UN agencies, civil \nsociety, and the private sector. To facilitate interaction, a representative steering committee with \nabout 10 members meets weekly to closely supervise the continuing needs assessment and \nidentify issues that need to be urgently addressed by the Government, while a larger meeting of \nall  development  partners  takes  place  every  2  weeks.  A  lead  agency  in  the  international \ncommunity  and  a  board  member  of  the  Task  Force  for  Rebuilding  the  Nation  (TAFREN) \nconvene  sector-level  meetings  where  the  development  partners  and  relevant  government \nministries  can  discuss  policy  issues,  refine  reconstruction  needs  estimates,  and  develop \nfinancing plans.  \n \n4.  ADB is the lead agency in the road sector. Together with TAFREN, the Ministry of \nHighways, and the Road Development Authority, ADB has convened three meetings, attended \nby the World Bank, JBIC, Japan International Cooperation Agency, the European Commission, \nthe  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  and  the  Swedish  International \nDevelopment  Cooperation  Agency,  during  which  the  overall  reconstruction  needs  were \nreviewed, the possible role of each agency discussed, and a tentative financing plan developed, \nto ensure that reconstruction activities are fully funded. Discussion was also started on the \nmeasures to ensure prompt and transparent implementation, the need to assess the capacity \nand possible role of the domestic contracting industry, the availability of construction materials, \nand long-term implications in terms of maintenance funding, and appropriate sequencing of the \nreconstruction in accordance to the road sector master plan being prepared.

Component  A  will  be  fully  funded  through  the  Asian  Tsunami  Fund  (ATF).  The \ndestruction wrought by tsunami has generated legal and documentary issues for tsunami-\naffected  people  and  the  government.  The  generous  contributions  of  tsunami-assistance \nprovided by the international community raise increase the risk of corruption and misuse of \nfunds. This component seeks to help the government restore or replace lost documents, and to \nhelp tsunami victims begin to resolve their legal and documentary problems. It also seeks to \nhelp the government confront the greater risks of corruption that may follow the high volume and \nscale of foreign assistance being contributed to Sri Lanka post-tsunami. Physical infrastructure \nand buildings for the law and administration of justice system are identified in this Appendix 7, \nand may be selected as a subproject, and financed under Component E: Southern Province \nReconstruction, and Component H: NECORD-II.  \n \n3.

Component B will expand the areas of implementation to tsunami-affected \ngrama niladhari divisions1 in Jaffna, Kilinochchi, and Mullaittivu districts. The coastal planning \nactivities will include the district of Mannar as well, thereby covering the entire North and East \ncoastal  area.  Subprojects  will  be  selected  and  prioritized  generally  through  the  subproject \nselection process described in Appendix 6.  \n \n9.  Infrastructure.  Small-scale  community  infrastructure  could  include  minor  roads, \nculverts,  drains,  small-scale  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  simple  solid  waste \nmanagement schemes, community buildings, and market and auction halls.

Coastal Zone Planning. The tsunami highlighted the importance of planning to avert or \nreduce the impact of natural disasters or, as more often encountered, cyclonic storms. The \nProject  will  support  a coastal  zone  planning process,  taking  into  consideration  the  natural \nhabitat and the need for coastal reservation zones. The planning process will be participatory, \nwith coordination at the division, district, and provincial levels. The ultimate outcome of this \nprocess will be a consolidation and incorporation of planning outputs with the National Coastal \nZone Management Plan.  \n \nC.

More thorough and permanent road rebuilding measures, particularly for improved \ndrainage, are necessary to protect the roadway network of main transport links and feeder \nroads along the coastal belt, particularly against frequent high rains and potential flooding. The \nrehabilitation of strategic road links in the North East will improve disaster-response capacity \nand promote economic growth and community development.  \n \n14.  The component will rebuild approximately 300 kilometers (km) of major coastal road \nlinks (classes A and B) in tsunami-affected areas, in the South and the North East. About 200 \nkm of damaged class-C, -D, and -E access roads in the Southern Province will be rebuilt and \nprovided with improved drainage.  \n \n15.  Tsunami-affected roads will be rebuilt according to national standards for each class of \nroad. Measures will be incorporated into the designs to improve performance and durability \nagainst expected coastal weather and drainage patterns. To provide better access for cyclists \nand pedestrians, particularly in the North East, shoulders will be paved where possible. The \nroad works will include removal of mines and unexploded ordnance, reconstruction of previously \nsurfaced roads, drainage improvements and clearing, and repair or replacement of bridges. As \nthe  works  will  be  carried  out  within  the  existing  right-of-way,  neither  land  acquisition  nor \nresettlement are expected to be required.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "62  Appendix 5a \nTable A5a.2: Indicative Roads Requiring Immediate Rehabilitation \n \n    Length \nNumber  Route  (km) \nA2  Galle Road\u2013Galle to Matara  40 \nA2-A4-A25- Matara to East Coast (two-lane asphalt standard to Wellawaya \n130 \nA31  and balance to two-lane DBST standard.) \nA4  Panama to Batticaloa   150 \nA15  Batticaloa to Trincomalee   130 \nB010-A15  Kantale to Somapura + A15 Somapura to Muttur  55 \nAB021  Point Pedro to Ponnalai to Jaffna   40 \nA34  Mankulam to Mullaittivu  50 \nB296  Puliyankulam to Mullaittivu  41 \nSource: Asian Development Bank and CRMP project management unit estimates. \n \nD.

The local government road subcomponent will include rehabilitation of \nlocal government road networks and bridges damaged by the tsunami in Galle, Matara, and \nHambantota. All road construction will be on existing alignments and will not require land \nacquisition or resettlement. Roads to be rehabilitated will be selected from the list of roads \nidentified by the needs assessment and prioritized during implementation.  \n \n20.  Community  and  Urban  Infrastructure.  The  tsunami  destroyed  or  damaged  a \nconsiderable amount of community infrastructure along the southern coastal belt. Subprojects \nwill  rebuild  community  and  urban  infrastructure,  including  local  government  offices  and \nbuildings, courthouses, public libraries, ayurvedic (traditional medicine) dispensaries, children \nparks, playgrounds, and village markets.  \n \n21.  Shelter. About 28,000 houses are damaged or destroyed in the tsunami-affected areas \nof the Southern Province. While other donors have made large commitments to reconstruct \ndamaged or destroyed housing, this component will build shelter if demand is unmet. Shelter \nreconstruction will follow Government policy in selection and total assistance allowance per \nfamily.  If  adequate  donor  financing  is  available,  funds  will  be  used  for  other  community \ninfrastructure rebuilding subprojects.  \n \n22.  Legal and Administrative Infrastructure. The courts, prisons, and district registries \ndescribed in Appendix 7, could be selected as subprojects under component E.  \n \nF.  Component F: Coastal Resources Management  \n \n23.  Component F will be fully funded through the ATF. Subprojects will repair damage done \nto  coastal  stabilization  structures  and  harbor  breakwaters,  and  provide  small  fishing  boat \nanchorages and fisheries-related ancillary units, such as boat-building yards, net repair sheds, \nor cold-storage facilities, in the Southern and Western provinces. Coastal stabilization measures \nfor the Hikkaduwa and Bentota-Beruwala sites, which have been designed by the Coastal \nResources Management Project3 (CRMP)  will be extended as result of tsunami damage and \ndegradation.  Other  areas  in  need  of  urgent  repair  include  the  Kogalle  outlet,  Talpe,  and \nBattigama. Restoration of these and other similar sections is urgent and will be carried out \nbefore the next monsoon.

Repairs  to  fisheries  harbors  identified  include  mainly  rehabilitation  of  harbor \nbreakwaters. A special feature of this component includes environmental management along \nthe coastal buffer zone, which is being created. Component F will enhance coastal protection by \nreestablishing green zones or green belts through intensive forestation with coastal vegetation, \nincluding mangroves that would serve as effective barriers not only against tsunami but also \nagainst coastal erosion, and other potentially life-threatening phenomena such as cyclones, \nhurricanes, floods, and sea-level rise.

Component G: Rural Finance \n \n25.  The costs of restoring livelihood in the short- and medium-term have been estimated at \n$140 million. The largest share (over $80 million in the short term) would be in the form of \nmicrofinance or grants and aid in kind to restore the income-earning capacity of the fishers, and \nother micro-entrepreneurs. In a quick response, the Central Bank offers a 3% refinance scheme \nto  state-owned  and  private  banks  as  well  as  leasing  companies  for  disbursing  credit  to \nenterprises at a concessional lending interest rate of 6%.  \n \n26.  To supplement these efforts, and to ensure the loans go to those who need them most\u2014\nlow-income households, which comprise about 75% of all affected households\u2014component G \nwill provide microcredit through arrangements similar to the existing for tsunami-affected people \nunder the Rural Finance Sector Development Program4 (RSFDP). Financing for this component \nwill be sourced from a reallocation of funds from other ongoing projects and the ATF. RSFDP \nhas 140 participating microfinance institutions, with a strong presence in the South. The loan \nsize to the borrower will be limited to Rs100,000. Outreach programs and skills training will \nprovide information to affected persons on opportunities for microenterprise. Grant support \nmight be considered during implementation to improve skill development, and to ensure lower \ncredit costs for households for the duration of the tsunami emergency credit. The interest rate \ncharged will not be above 6%, in line with the Central Bank directive for loans to tsunami-\naffected people.  \n \n27.  A major change in implementation arrangement for RFSDP was approved by the ADB \nVice President (Operations Group 1) on 23 February 2005 to provide microcredit to tsunami \naffected households (without changing existing criteria) for the restoration of productive assets \nand development of income-generating activities.  \n \nH.  Component H: NECORD-Tsunami  \n \n28.  Subprojects under component H will reconstruct (i) basic social infrastructure damaged \nor  destroyed  in  the  coastal  belt  by  the  tsunami  in  a  variety  of  sectors,  including  health, \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2004.

Basic Social Infrastructure  \n \n29.  Health,  Education,  Administrative,  and  Institutional  Facilities.  Subprojects  will \nrestore facilities damaged or destroyed by the tsunami. Infrastructure will be rebuilt according to \nGovernment policies and regulations for post-tsunami reconstruction.  \n \n30.  Water Supply and Sanitation. Improvements will provide small community-based and \nmedium-sized town schemes, along with appropriate sanitation facilities to the community. This \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  will  be  linked  to  village  community  development  activities, \nparticularly where people displaced by the tsunami are returning. The approach and procedures \nof implementation of the water supply and sanitation subcomponents will be in accordance with \nthe National Policy for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector, particularly in community \nparticipation process approach, including cost-sharing arrangements, selection of technology, \nprocurement  of  small  works  by  beneficiaries,  and  participation  of  local  government  in \nimplementation.  \n \n31.  Rural Roads. Rural access roads washed out by the tsunami will be reconstructed using \nlabor-intensive methods to provide gravel-surfaced rural roads, to connect villages to the road \nnetwork, irrigation schemes, or community facilities. All road construction will be on existing \nalignments and will not require land acquisition or resettlement.  \n \n2.  Village Development and Shelter  \n \n32.  Village and Community Infrastructure. Facilities damaged or destroyed in the tsunami \nwill be rebuilt, including markets, community halls, legal-sector infrastructure such as police \nstations, courthouses, prisons, and district registries (Appendix 7). To provide a respite from the \nreminders of the conflict and the tsunami, small recreational facilities will be developed to aid \nchildren, youths, and the elderly recuperate from the trauma.  \n \n33.  Shelter. As in the Southern Province, donors have made large commitments to rebuild \ndamaged or destroyed housing in the North East. If demand remains unmet, this component will \nconstruct shelter for vulnerable tsunami-affected families. Shelter will be provided in situ\u2014only \nat  preexisting  house  sites\u2014and  in  accordance  with  Government  regulations  for  tsunami \nreconstruction, including Government policy on selection and total assistance allowance per \nfamily.  If  adequate  donor  financing  is  available  for  shelter  reconstruction,  funds  for  this \nsubcomponent will be used for other village and community infrastructure subprojects.  \n ", "Appendix 5b  67\nSECTOR SCOPE AND CRITERIA \nNORTH EAST COMMUNITY RESTORATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II \n \n1.  This section outlines the scope of the sectors. The broad selection criteria are explained \nin the main text of the report and recommendation of the President. The selection criteria will \nfollow  the  already  developed  criteria  for  the  different  sectors  under  the  ongoing  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  funded  projects  in  the  conflict-affected  areas.  During  project \ninception, the detailed selection criteria will be developed and agreed on with the stakeholders.  \n \n2.  Subprojects will be financed through a grant and loan funds. The grant funds will be \nused to reconstruct (i) community development, (ii) access roads and equipment for road works, \n(iii) special programs on HIV/AIDS1 and gender programs, and (iv) training. \n \n3.  The loan funds will be used for basic institutional infrastructure damaged or destroyed by \nthe conflict in a variety of sectors, including health, education, community water supply and \nsanitation, and equipment.  \n \nA.  Grant Funds \n \n1.  Community Development \n \n4.  Village Development. A wide range of village-level subprojects across several sectors \nwill restore livelihoods, provide opportunities to generate income, and support reconciliation and \nsocial cohesion. Livelihood opportunities will be provided in communities through subprojects \nthat promote livestock development and market gardening, provide facilities for seed production, \nand other sectors that the communities are engaged. Restoration of district agriculture centers \nwill help farmers. Skill development and service training will be provided for microenterprise \ndevelopment in areas such as horticulture, postharvest food processing, and the tourism and \nhotel industry. To enable community-based organizations (CBOs) to promote microenterprise \ndevelopment at the village level, revolving funds will be established and managed by the CBO. \nGender-oriented programs for enterprise development, initiated as a pilot program under the \nNECORD \u2013 Extension Project, will be expanded to a wider range of fishing and agricultural \ncommunities. Given the high influx of construction workers responding to the recent increase in \nNorth  East  construction  activity,  an  HIV/AIDS  awareness  campaign  will  be  waged  among \nconstruction workers and internally displaced people.  \n \n5.  Shelter. Conflict-affected returnees will be provided shelter at their previous house sites. \nShelter reconstruction will follow Government policy in selection and total assistance allowance \nper family. \n \n2.  Civil Works \u2013 Rural / Access Roads \n \n6.  Access Roads. Rural access road construction will use labor-intensive methods to \nprovide gravel-surfaced rural roads, connecting villages to the road network, irrigation schemes, \nor community facilities. A small number of class-C or -D provincial roads will be rehabilitated \nwith all-weather surfaces. All road construction will be on existing alignments and will not require \nland acquisition or resettlement.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

Institutional capacity will be improved through subprojects \nthat restore damaged local government facilities and district offices or establish new ones, and \nrehabilitate courts, and registrars offices in the North East. Although area institutions have \nmanaged recent reconstruction activities well, the recent surge in construction and coordination \nactivities that result require stronger development capacity of these institutions.  \n \n4.  Training \n \n8.  Training. This component will supply training to staff in public administration, accounts, \nand information management. In anticipation of the growing need for skilled employees, training \nwill be provided to youths in construction, motor mechanics, and tourism-related trades, and will \nencompass construction of any special facilities required to provide these trainings.  \n \nB.  Loan Funds\u2014Civil Works (basic social infrastructure) \n \n9.  Health.  Subprojects  will  restore  critical  referral  medical  facilities  through  hospital \nreconstruction  and  refurbishment,  provision  and  replacement  of  medical  equipment  and \nfurniture, construction of doctor\u2019s quarters at hospital compounds, and rehabilitation of village \nhealth  clinics.  Although  hospital  staffing  is  generally  satisfactory,  an  essential  subproject \nselection criterion will stipulate sufficient availability of qualified staff to operate the rehabilitated \nfacilities as well as other existing facilities.  \n \n10.  Education. Subprojects will restore services and facilities through (i) reconstruction and \nrehabilitation of teaching facilities and school buildings serving a large population area; (ii) \nconstruction  of  cluster  housing  units  for  teachers  in  areas  where  housing  is  limited  or \nunavailable; and (iii) provision of training in special subjects such as primary education, English, \nscience, and math to teachers. Schools will only be rehabilitated where teachers are or can be \nmade available. Cluster-housing units will be provided where housing is limited or has been \ndestroyed. Specialist training will be provided to improve the quality of the teachers, especially \nnew recruits.  \n \n11.  Water Supply and Sanitation. Improvements will provide small community-based and \nmedium-sized town schemes, along with sanitation facilities. Water supply and sanitation will be \nlinked to village community development activities, particularly where internally displaced people \nare  returning.  The  approach  and  procedures  of  implementation  of  the  water  supply  and \nsanitation subcomponents will be in accordance with the National Policy for Rural Water Supply \nand Sanitation Sector, particularly in the community participation process approach, including \ncost-sharing  arrangements,  selection  of  technology,  procurement  of  small  works  by \nbeneficiaries, and participation of local government in the implementation.  \n \n12.  Irrigation.  Activities  will  include  rehabilitation  of  medium-sized  and  large  irrigation \nschemes. Works will include rehabilitation of tank bunds, channel systems, access roads, and \nother structures, without changes to, or diversions of, natural watercourses. The activity will be \nlinked to village, agriculture, and livestock development.  \n ", "Appendix 6  69\nSUBPROJECT SELECTION PROCESS \n \n1.  The North East Community Restoration and Development Project (NECORD) uses a \nsector-style process approach to develop individual subprojects. This approach, which works \nwell, will be used to prepare subprojects under component B (North East coastal community \ndevelopment), component E (Southern Province reconstruction), and component H (NECORD-\nTsunami),  under  the  Tsunami-affected  Areas  Rebuilding  Project  (TAARP)  and  subprojects \nunder the North East Community Restoration and Development Project II (NECORD-II).  \n \n2.  Subprojects will be initially conceived by beneficiaries, nongovernment organizations, \ngovernment  departments,  or  newly  formed  village  rehabilitation  committees  to  restore \ncommunity livelihoods and area infrastructure damaged or lost as a result of the tsunami or the \ndecades-long  conflict.  These  subproject  proposals  will  be  first  presented  to  the  divisional \nrehabilitation  committee  (DRC)  present  in  the  affected  districts.  The  DRC  will  review  and \nevaluate  each  proposal  against  set  subproject  criteria.  If  approved,  the  proposal  will  be \nforwarded to the district rehabilitation coordinating committee (DRCC) or its equivalent, which \nwill further scrutinize the subproject. The district project management unit (DPMU) will help \nthese agencies prepare subproject proposals in the standard formats to be used for both \nprojects.  \n \n3.  After  approval  by  the  DRCC,  the  DPMU  through  the  government  agent  or  district \nsecretary will present the subproject to the respective project management units (PMUs), which \nwill review each subproject in detail, to ensure that the subproject (i) addresses the overall \nscope of the project, (ii) is eligible under the general and subcomponent-related criteria, (iii) will \nnot create any problems in the area, (iv) has been sufficiently justified, and (v) will attain the \ndesired outputs and benefits. The PMUs will (i) perform a detailed review of the subproject cost \nestimate  and  implementation  schedule;  (ii)  verify  beneficiary  contribution;  (iii)  determine  if \ncontractors are available and capable of performing the work; (iv) confirm that land will be \navailable; and (v) investigate any gender, social, or environmental concerns.  \n \n4.  If the PMU finds that the subproject satisfies all the evaluation criteria, the proposal will \nbe then forwarded to the provincial project coordinating committee (PPCC) and, 15 days before \na PPCC meeting, circulated to ADB and the relevant secretaries, ministries, provincial, and \ndistrict heads of departments; government agents; government security coordinators (police, \narmy); nongovernment organizations; the United Nations system; and any other development \ninstitution  implementing  projects  in  the  area  (World  Bank,  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation, etc.).  \n \n5.  The PPCC, chaired by the chief secretary, typically meets every 2 months to present \neach subproject for conditional approval. Attendees at the PCC include ADB, relevant PMU \nstaff, government agents, district deputy project directors, and representatives from national \nministries. Subprojects not approved by the PPCC will be returned to the PMU or DPMU for \nfurther clarification or justification. If a subproject is approved by the PPCC, the PMU will inform \nthe proponent to develop the subproject to include the designs, bill of quantities, specifications, \nand  the  bid  documents.  The  final  subproject  proposal  will  then  be  forwarded  to  ADB  for \napproval. Subprojects not approved by ADB will be returned to the PMU for clarification or \nmodifications  to  better  comply  with  criteria  set  forth  for  TAARP  or  NECORD-II  or  ADB \nguidelines.  \n ", "70  Appendix 6 \n6.  Once ADB gives final approval, competitive tenders will be called, bids evaluated, and \nawards  made  to  the  substantially  responsive  lowest  bidder.

The destruction wrought by tsunami has generated legal and documentary issues for \ntsunami-affected people and the government. The generous contributions of tsunami-assistance \nprovided by the international community increase the risk of corruption and misuse of funds. \nThis component seeks to help the government restore or replace lost documents, and to help \ntsunami victims begin to resolve their legal and documentary problems. It also seeks to help the \ngovernment confront the greater risks of corruption that may follow the high volume and scale of \nforeign assistance being contributed to Sri Lanka post-tsunami.

The  subcomponents  of  the  Legal  Assistance,  Governance  and  Anticorruption \nComponent are to: \n \n(i)  provide legal assistance and facilitation to tsunami-affected victims for accessing \nlegal entitlements to help them address issues of legal entitlement arising from \nthe tsunami; \n \n(ii)  establish or strengthen a decentralized mechanism for tsunami victims for private \ndispute  resolution,  and  grievance  review  against  public  officials,  which  may \ninvolve  one  or  a  combination  of  the  following  mechanisms  currently  under \nconsideration: \n \n(a)  Tsunami Mediation Boards, based on existing statutory mediation boards; \n \n(b)  a  decentralized  Office  of  Tsunami  Ombudsmen,  or  extension  of  the \njurisdiction of the existing Parliamentary Commissioner (Ombudsmen) to \ndeal with grievances against public officials relating to the tsunami; and  \n \n(c)  establishing a unit within the administrative division of Sri Lanka\u2019s Bribery \nand  Corruption  Commission,  to  concentrate  on  the  detection, \ninvestigation,  and response to  tsunami-related corruption;  \n \n(iii)  conduct  training  and  awareness  workshops  for  judges,  magistrates,  district \nofficials, and the public on potential tsunami / disaster emergency related legal \nissues, disputes or cases, including the tsunami legislative framework that may \nbe adopted for making special provision for persons and property affected by the \ntsunami;  \n \n(iv)  support the Registrar General\u2019s Department issue replacement birth, death, and \nmarriage certificates, and property titles;  \n \n(v)  support the Department of the Registration of Persons facilitate the issuance or \nreissuance of identity cards;  \n \n(vi)  support transparency of tsunami and emergency assistance, through the Office \nof the President by: \n ", "Appendix 7  73\n(a)  supporting or facilitating the publication in Sinhala, Tamil, and English, on \nthe internet and in government newspapers, of (1) modes of tsunami \nassistance  from  development  partners  and  NGOs,  (2)  contract  and \nprocurement details in relation to tsunami-assistance, (3) any proposed \nlaws,  bills,  or  policy  relating  to  tsunami-assistance  (4)  Sri  Lanka\u2019s \nassistance to tsunami affected people; and  \n \n(b)   supporting  data  collection  for  tsunami  affected  people,  and  tsunami \naffected property and infrastructure, by coordinating data collection from \nthe Department of the Registration of Persons, the Registrar General, and \nother relevant departments or authorities, through modernizing collection \nof  such  data,  and  transforming  manual  central  record  keeping  into \ncomputerized  record  keeping  and  retrieval,  and  facilitating  the \nconnectivity, coordination and networking of such data and information; \nand \n \n(vii)  support to the MOFP for ensuring good governance in NGO provision of tsunami \nassistance by supporting the development of guidelines or regulations on NGO \ngovernance,  accountability,  transparency,  and  registration  in  the  provision  of \ntsunami assistance.  \n \nA.  Legal Facilitation and Assistance  \n \n1.  Tsunami-generated Legal and Documentary Issues  \n \n3.  The destruction wrought by tsunami has generated legal and documentary issues for \ntsunami-affected  people  and  the  government.  Such  legal  issues  arise  from  the  loss  of \ndocuments, such as property titles, birth, death, and marriage certificates, court records, and \nbank account documents. They also arise from the devastating loss of life caused by the \ntsunami, as, following these mass deaths, custody, fostering, and adoption of children, and the \ninheritance of real and personal property have all arisen as problems. Issues such as insurance \ncoverage, property disputes, and other entitlement issues are follow-on concerns.  \n \n4.  The  Government  is  developing  a  legislative  framework  for  the  post-tsunami \nreconstruction period to enable special legal provisions for persons and property affected by the \ntsunami, and related purposes. Legislation under the framework would shorten the presumption \nof death, provide for the custody, fostering, and adoption of children, and establish provisions \nrelated to property rights. It would also double the penalty for any crime, if it is committed in \nrelation to property or money intended for tsunami relief. The legislative framework assumes \nknowledge of the law and also establishes crimes in relation to custody of tsunami-affected \nchildren if certain requirements are not met.  \n \n5.  To translate formal legal solutions into solutions for tsunami-affected people, will require \nthem,  and  divisional  and  district  level  government  officials  (District  Secretaries,  Divisional \nSecretaries, and grama niladhari1), to understand these new legal requirements, and be able to \nproceed along appropriate channels. They will also need to have assistance to resolve any legal \nquestions that may arise. Members of the law and administration of justice system in tsunami-\naffected areas will similarly need to be made aware of the mechanisms for resolving tsunami-\nrelated legal and administrative problems.  In the tsunami-affected areas of the North and East \n                                                 \n1 Grama niladhari divisions are the lowest level of government administration.  ", "74  Appendix 7 \nand  the  South,  already  poor  and  vulnerable  people  will  have  difficulty  negotiating  formal \navenues, and clearly need assistance to avail themselves of the new laws and procedures.  \n \n2.  Legal Facilitation and Assistance  \n \n6.  ADB has received strong requests from Provincial Government to support the provision \nof decentralized legal facilitation and assistance for tsunami-related issues. As a subcomponent \nof this component, legal facilitation and assistance for tsunami-related legal and documentary \nissues would be provided to tsunami-affected people. The provision of assistance would be \nfunctionally decentralized in the tsunami-affected areas of the North and East, the South, and \nthe  West  and  Colombo  shall  be  covered  together.  The  provision  of  legal  assistance  and \nfacilitation would be coordinated with, but separate from each Provincial Secretariat, and offices \nwould also be decentralized with a small secretariat in the North and East (Trincomalee), and \nthe South. Staff would have access to transportation in order to conduct outreach, by visiting \naffected communities, and to service all relevant districts. Approximately seven legal facilitators \nwould be engaged in the North and East, nominally one for each of the seven tsunami-affected \ndistricts. However, certain districts may need more assistance than others. Approximately three \nlegal facilitators would also be engaged in the South, nominally one for each district in the \nSouth. A least an additional legal facilitator will be engaged in Colombo to serve Colombo and \nKalutara tsunami victims, who would work together with TAARP director/coordinator. Where \ndeemed appropriate by the MOJ, and agreed with ADB, legal facilitation and assistance under \nTAARP may be channeled through and support existing offices of the Legal Aid Commission. In \nthe North and East where existing Legal Aid Commission offices do not exist, or for simple \nmatters not requiring access to courts, legal facilitators would not be attached to the Legal Aid \nCommission.  \n \n7.  This  component  coordinator/director  would  coordinate  this  subcomponent,  facilitate \ncross learning amongst the decentralized offices and monitor the conduct of legal services. This \nsubcomponent would be closely coordinated with the Legal Aid Commission, its associated \nProvincial  Bar  Associations,  the  Retired  Judges  Association,  the  United  Nations  High \nCommission  on  Refugees,  the  United  Nation\u2019s  Development  Program,  civil  society \norganizations (CSOs), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including the International \nDevelopment Law Organization. and other relevant development partners.  \n \nB.  Private  Dispute  Resolution,  Public  Grievance  Review,  and  Anticorruption \nComplaints  \n \n8.  The  legal  and  factual  issues  generated  by  the  tsunami,  are  also  likely  to  lead  to \nincreased disputes and grievances both among tsunami-affected people, and possibly against \ngovernment officers and departments. The Government has agreed with donors on a set of \nGuiding Principles to be followed on the path to recovery from the tsunami. Among other things, \nthe Guiding Principles promote transparency, participation, accountability, and a zero-tolerance \nfor  any  corruption  associated  with  tsunami  assistance.  Similarly  the  proposed  tsunami \nlegislative framework would increase penalties for tsunami related crimes and improprieties. In \nfurtherance of the Guiding Principles and the Government\u2019s objectives, and to assist tsunami-\naffected  people  with  disputes  and  grievances,  a  decentralized  provincial  system  of  public \ngrievance  review  and  private  dispute  resolution  would  be  established  or  supported  in  the \ntsunami-affected areas and staffed by independent persons in the North and East, the South, \nand Colombo. The mechanisms would seek to resolve private disputes, and investigate claims \nof  impropriety  against  public  officials  relating  to  tsunami  assistance.  Three  proposals  for \nachieving this end are currently being considered. A combination of these mechanisms is ", "Appendix 7  75\nviewed  as  likely  the  most  appropriate  way  to  provide  a  form  of  dispute  resolution,  public \ngrievance review, and anti-corruption fora. The final mechanism may involve a combination of \nall or a different combination of these.  \n \n1.  Mediation Boards \n9.  Under the Mediation Board approach, support would be provided to establish Tsunami \nMediation Boards, in conjunction with the MOJ, and the Asia Foundation. The Asia Foundation \nhas successfully worked with the Government to establish existing statutory Mediation Boards. \nUnder the Mediation (Special Categories of Disputes) Act, No. 21 of 2003, the Minister of \nJustice is entitled to gazette special Mediation Boards, for special categories, special areas, and \nfor specific categories of dispute. Currently under consideration, is the gazetting of Tsunami \nMediation Boards as a special category, and defining tsunami-affected areas, and tsunami \ndisputes such as property and custody disputes as specific categories.  Such special Tsunami \nMediation Boards would also have the power to consider grievances against public officials, \nhowever they may not be the most effective fora to do so as sensitive issues of administrative \nlaw may be raised, or possibly issues of corruption or impropriety, that are not suitable for \nconsensus-based solutions. Various forms of support may be required to ensure that mediation \nboards  become  functional  in  tsunami-affected  areas,  including  training  and  engaging \nconsultants.  \n \n2.  Tsunami  Ombudsmen  or  Extension  of  Parliamentary  Commissioner \n(Ombudsmen) to Tsunami-Affected Areas \n \n10.  ADB  has  received  strong  requests  from  Provincial  Government  to  support  a \ndecentralized Office of Tsunami Ombudsmen. Under this approach, TAARP would support the \nestablishment of a decentralized Office of Tsunami Ombudsmen or the extension of jurisdiction \nof the existing Parliamentary Commissioner (Ombudsmen) established under Article XIX of the \nConstitution of Sri Lanka and the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration Act No. 17 of \n1981, to tsunami-affected areas, to deal with grievances against public officials relating to the \ntsunami.  This  approach  adopts  lessons  learned  from  the  experience  following  the  Gujarat \nearthquake in India.  In the wake of that earthquake, which killed over 20,000 people, the Indian \nHigh Court gave orders for speedy and effective legal aid for victims. A new ombudsmen role \nwas  given  to  the  State  Legal  Services  Authority  to  look  into  complaints  against  public \nadministration. Also, with the help of the Ombudsmen, special legal cells were made functional \nto facilitate legal assistance on legal issues pertaining to inheritance, family law, and property.  \n \n11.  On  the  basis  of  the  Provincial  Government  proposal,  each  Office  of  Tsunami \nOmbudsmen would have a provincial coordinator, and be associated with, but separate from the \nProvincial Secretariat. Approximately four Tsunami Ombudsmen would be assigned to the North \nand East, and approximately two Tsunami Ombudsmen would be assigned to the South. Its \nstaff would service all relevant districts by conducting outreach to tsunami-affected areas. The \nOffice would establish the threshold criteria and procedures for handling such complaints, for \nproactively and constructively responding to them, and for providing the public with notice of \nsuch Office, including publishing notices in government-owned newspapers. The Office would \nbe  closely  coordinated  with  the  provision  of  tsunami  legal  facilitation  and  assistance,  the \nParliamentary  Commissioner  (Ombudsmen),  the  Retired  Judges  Association,  the  United \nNations High Commission on Refugees, the United Nation\u2019s Development Program on access \nto justice, civil society organizations (CSOs), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), \nincluding the International Development Law Organization. and other relevant development \npartners.  ", "76  Appendix 7 \n12.  The possibility of implementing the functions of the Tsunami Ombudsmen by extending \nthe powers and function of the existing Parliamentary Commissioner (Ombudsmen) has been \nraised. If this becomes the Government\u2019s preferred approach, ADB would ensure that it serves \nthe needs initially requested by the Provincial Government. In such a case, TAARP would \nsupport the Parliamentary Commissioner (Ombudsmen) to go on circuit to the tsunami-affected \nareas. \n \n13.  The benefits of an ombudsmen approach to public grievance review and corruption \nredressal are clear and recognized by many stakeholders. However, there are certain legal \nchallenges in implementing an Office of Tsunami Ombudsmen in Sri Lanka, that would need to \nbe overcome for it able to be established quickly enough to be an effective response to public \ngrievances in the post- tsunami context. This approach remains tabled and under consideration, \nbut the other two approaches that work with existing institutions in Sri Lanka are currently \npreferred as more likely to be able to be used to provide a timely response.  \n \n3.  Bribery and Corruption Commission \n \n14.  New  Commissioners  to  the  Commission  to  Investigate  Allegations  of  Bribery  and \nCorruption (the \u201cBribery and Corruption Commission\u201d) were appointed in March 2005. The \nGovernment has agreed that the administrative branch that conducts investigations, and acts \nunder the Director General in the Bribery and Corruption Commission would be strengthened by \nformation of a tsunami unit, which may also have regional offices in tsunami affected areas. The \nBribery and Corruption Commission would thus serve tsunami-affected areas. TAARP would \nsupport this strengthening.  \n \nC.  Judicial Training Workshops and Legal Awareness \n \n15.  Magistrates, district court, and high court judges, in tsunami-affected areas, need to be \nfamiliarized with the property and custody legal issues likely to arise post-tsunami, and the post-\ntsunami legislative framework when enacted. The types of legal issues that are likely to arise \nare anticipated, however the details of the sorts of disputes have not yet been identified, and \nmay be investigated as part of the data-collection process described in part F below. Based on \nmore detailed data identifying the nature of tsunami-related legal disputes likely to come up in \ncourts, in conjunction with the MOJ and Sri Lanka\u2019s judicial training institute, TAARP would \ncoordinate  a  series  of  magistrate,  judicial  training,  officer,  and  public  legal  awareness \nworkshops in or for the tsunami-affected areas.  \n \n16.  The tsunami legislative framework presumes knowledge of the law and imposes jail \npenalties for violations such as holding custody of an \u201corphan\u201d without complying with certain \nprocedures.  Legal  awareness  workshops  will  be  coordinated  for  district  officials,  local  law \nenforcers, and the public, in conjunction with, or independently from the judicial workshops for  \ntsunami related issues.  \n \nD.  Replacement Documents  \n \n17.  The Registrar General\u2019s Department, within the Ministry of Public Administration and \nHome Affairs, oversees the registration of births, deaths, marriages, private property titles, and \nliens on moveable property. It is responsible for replacing documents destroyed in the tsunami, \noriginal birth, death, marriage, immoveable property liens, and property title documents either in \nthe possession of tsunami victims, or at district or divisional offices of the Registrar General.  \n ", "Appendix 7  77\n18.  In Galle alone, as of 29 March 2005, 8,000 applications had been made for replacement \ndocuments, of which only 2000 have been provided to tsunami affected people. A copy of all \nbirth, death, and marriage records held by individuals, and held in district or divisional offices is \nretained in the Central Record Room of the Registrar General in Colombo. However, the Central \nRecord Room is manually sorted, and categorized by registration numbers. If individuals who \napply for replacement documents do not know their registration number, many records must be \nsorted to provide a replacement. In many cases it would appear to be an almost impossible \ntask. The Central Record Room has limited photocopiers, and limited basic filing equipment.  \nThe essential post-tsunami reissuance of documents would appear not likely to get done, unless \nchanges are made.  \n \n19.  TAARP will provide support to the Registrar General\u2019s Department in reissuing birth, \ndeath,  marriage,  and  property  title  records  to  tsunami-affected  people,  and  issuing  death \ncertificates,  by  computerizing  their  Central  Record  Room  and  purchasing  filing  cabinets, \nphotocopiers, scanners, and similar office facilities, if required. This would be coordinated with \nthe Office of the President (discussed in part F below) who are attempting to centralize data \ncollection efforts to minimize duplications of efforts and to limit the extent to which tsunami \naffected people are approached by multiple government agencies and NGOs for similar data \ncollection  questions.  Following  preparatory  work  on  TAARP,  the  Office  of  President\u2019s \ncoordination  now  includes  the  Department  of  Registration  of  Persons,  and  the  Registrar \nGeneral.  Computer  automation  of  the  central  record  room  will  use  software  for  efficiently \ncapturing  and  retrieving  archived  documents.  ADB  may  support  the  purchase  of \ncomputers, and will support networking and connectivity of such equipment, as well as \nthe purchase of office items. It would also support mobile-van services to tsunami-affected \ndistricts, which may include retroactive financing. Computer automation of registration would \nreduce the extent that individuals could falsely obtain multiple registrations.  \n \nE.  Replacement or Issue of Identification Cards  \n \n20.  The Department of the Registration of Persons, within the Ministry of Public Security \nLaw and Order, issues identification cards. Identification cards are used in Sri Lanka to open \nbank accounts, obtain entry to certain places, to obtain passports, etc. Following the tsunami, \nthousands of identity cards need to be replaced, and tsunami-affected people issued with new \nidentification. Ensuring that all tsunami-affected people have an identity card that they use to \nobtain assistance is an additional measure to minimize false claims for assistance. As of 1 \nMarch 2005, following mobile teams sent to tsunami-affected areas in Kalutara, Galle, Matara, \nHambantota, Trincomalee and Kilinochchi Districts, over 30,000 applications for identity cards \nfor tsunami victims had been received. It is anticipated that over 100,000 applications would be \nreceived when all the mobile services are completed.  \n \n21.  The processing of applications including tracing and perusal of index cards and past \napplications is an essential part of the process. It is both time consuming and labor intensive.  \nThe overwhelming majority of applications are from people who have lost their identity cards \nand  do  not  remember  their  identity  card  number.  This  causes  additional  work  for  the \ndepartment. As the records are not computerized, the task of tracing all records has to be \nattended to manually. The records pertaining to more than 20.5 million identity cards are stored \nin three different locations in Keppetipola, Nugegoda and Barnes, adding to difficulties as the \nnormal work of the department has to be attended simultaneously. However, the issuing of \nidentity cards for tsunami victims cannot be delayed. Department staff are being deployed after \nworking hours and during week-ends. It is expected that the extra remuneration payable to the ", "78  Appendix 7 \nstaff deployed for this work will be in the region of Rs1,000,000 at the rate of Rs10.00 per \napplication and even with additionally deployed staff there is no surety that the records will be \nlocated. The Department does not have funds to meet this expenditure, nor associated needed \noffice  facilities  services  such  as  computers  and  photocopiers.  This  subcomponent  would \nsupport the Department of the Registration of Persons, in a similar way to that done for the \nRegistrar  General.  In  addition  to  promoting  coordination,  and  joint  data  collection  efforts, \nTAARP would computerize data held by the Department of the Registration of Persons, to allow \nit to be matched with data obtained from tsunami-affected persons. To further limit the use and \nabuse of tsunami assistance funds by tsunami-affected individuals, a temporary identification \ncard would be issued and connected to a tsunami-affected individual\u2019s details. By doing this, the \nextent to which false claims could be reduced. In addition, mobile-van services and outreach to \ntsunami-affected districts, would be supported if necessary. \n \nF.  Transparency and Tsunami Data Collection \n \n22.  The Office of the President, through its Department of Policy, Research and Information \nUnit media has begun efforts to coordinate the many separate effort to collect data in relation to \ntsunami-affected infrastructure and tsunami affected people. This coordination now includes the \nDepartment of the Registration of Persons and the Registrar General.  They are attempting to \ncentralize data collection efforts to minimize duplications of efforts and to limit the extent to \nwhich tsunami-affected people are approached by multiple government agencies and NGOs for \nsimilar data collection questions. The Office of the President has obtained from IBM computers \na  large  number  of  lap-top  computers  and  hardware  that  could  be  used  for  personal \nidentification,  that  it  plans  to  use  in  and  distribute  to  each  tsunami-affected  district.  The \ncomputers would be used to store data on tsunami-related needs and damage, to facilitate \ncentralization  and  coordination  of  tsunami-related  data,  to  maximize  transparency,  and  to \nimprove governance and limit the potential for corruption. However, for such hardware to be \nused for its intended purposes, the Office of the President needs to have the stand-alone \nlaptops connected and networked to ensure transferal and connectivity of data. In addition, \ninformation technology staff are needed to collect the data, and may need some training. \nTAARP will support the connectivity and networking of the computers, and the training or \nengagement of staff. Once the data is obtained from tsunami-affected people, a temporary \ntsunami-identification  card  and  number  would  be  issued,  and  the  temporary  tsunami-\nidentification and number would be used to facilitate matching information to locate records \npreviously stored manually.  \n \n23.  Under the subcomponents described above in part D and E, once centrally kept data is \nautomated, and the information linked, the data collected from tsunami-affected people would \nbe able to be matched with it, to provide tsunami-affected people with some of their lost records.  \n \n24.  In addition, the Office of the President, through its Department of Policy, Research and \nInformation Unit media, would facilitate the coordination required to ensure that information on \ntsunami  assistance,  post-tsunami  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction,  and  related  laws  and \npolicies, would be placed on a tsunami web-site, and published in Sinhala, Tamil, and English, \nin the government\u2019s newspapers. This would require some coordination amongst departments, \ndonors, and NGOs to obtain the appropriate information. The information to be included may \npresent financial statements, track procurement contract awards, including its amount, and \nbasic information on the processes adopted, the list of goods or services purchased and their \nutilization.  \n \n   ", "Appendix 7  79\nG.  NGO Accountability \n \n25.  The number of NGOs that now exist in Sri Lanka has increased dramatically from in \nrecent months post-tsunami.  NGOs commonly call for accountability from government and the \nprivate  sector  in  conducting  their  activities.  At  the  request  of  the  government,  in  order  to \nfacilitate accountability, transparency and good governance, from  all NGOs operating in the \npost-tsunami context, TAARP will support a consultant to work with the MOFP on refining \nguidelines  or  regulations  on  NGO  governance,  accountability,  transparency,  and  possibly \nregistration in the provision of NGO Tsunami assistance.  \n \nH.  Law, Justice, and Public Administration Infrastructure \n \n26.  Law and administration of justice infrastructure will not be financed under Component A, \nbut may be selected as community infrastructure subprojects and financed by TAARP under \nComponents E and H.  \n \n27.  Courts and labor tribunals, prisons, and police stations, were damaged and destroyed by \nthe tsunami. The MOJ has assessed the damage to courts and labor tribunals, prisons, and \npolice stations, to amount to be between $37 million and $45 million\u2013\u2013a subset of which has \nbeen  identified  as  immediate  priorities.  Table  A7.1  sets  out  the  immediate  priorities  for \nreconstruction of courts and judges quarters. Table A7.2 sets out the identified priorities for \nreconstruction of prisons. Ultimately, legal assistance, and quasi-judicial grievance review will \nonly work in the shadow of the formal legal system, so the reconstruction of courts, police \nstations, prisons is necessary as a first step to getting the formal legal system operational in the \ntsunami-affected areas. Under TAARP, courts and court complexes in tsunami-affected areas \ncan be restored as subprojects within Components E and H.  \n \n28.  As described above, the Registrar General registers births, deaths, marriages, private \nproperty title, and liens on moveable property. The tsunami destroyed the Matara and Mullaittivu \nLand and District Registry Offices of the Registrar General, and the damaged Civil Registration \nSection, of the Divisional Secretariats of the Registrar General in the districts of Weligama, \nHikkaduwa,  and  Pottuvil.  These  tsunami-destroyed  buildings,  and  records,  will need  to  be \nrestored or replaced. TAARP would permit urgent reconstruction of these offices as subprojects \nunder Components E and H. Table A7.3 sets out the identified priorities for reconstruction of \ndivisional  and  district  offices  of  the  Registrar  General.  In  addition,  other  priorities  for \nreconstruction of public administration infrastructure would include Grama Niladhari Office\u2019s, \nand provincial, district or divisional secretariat offices in tsunami-affected areas as identified by \nthe Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n29.  The MOJ would be the executing agency for this component, and would also be the \nimplementing  agency  for  subcomponents  (i)  to  (iii).  The  implementing  agencies  for  the \nremaining subcomponents would be as follows: \n \n(i)  Subcomponent (iv) - The Registrar General\u2019s Department;  \n(ii)  Subcomponent (v) \u2013 the Department of the Registration of Persons;  \n(iii)  Subcomponent (vi) - The Office of the President; and \n(iv)  Subcomponent (vii) \u2013 MOF. \n ", "80  Appendix 7 \n30.  For this component, a project office, led by a coordinator/director, and supported by \nsufficient staff to adequately conduct the component activities, would be established within the \nMOJ.  \n \n31.  To coordinate this component, a coordinating committee will be established, and will \nmeet bimonthly. It will be chaired by the Secretary, MOJ, and comprised of representatives from \nthe Ministry of Public Security, Law and Order, the MOFP, the Ministry of Public Administration \nand Home Affairs, the Registrar General\u2019s Department, the Department of the Registration of \nPersons, the Office of the President, including representatives from the Department of Policy, \nResearch and Information Unit media, the project coordinator/director, SPC and NEPC, and any \nother relevant persons.  \n \n32.  To coordinate the provision of legal and administrative infrastructure with Component E \nand Component H, a representative from the MOJ, and the Ministry of Public Administration and \nHome Affairs, and the project coordinator/director of this component may attend the national \nproject coordination committee meetings, and the provincial project coordination committee \nmeetings.  \n \nH.  Government and Development Partners: ADB\u2019s Approach \n33.  ADB\u2019s focus under this component will be to assist the government, in particular through \nthe MOJ, to provide a streamlined and coordinated approach to responding to the legal, public \nadministration, justice and governance issues arising in the wake of the tsunami.  \n \n34.  To coordinate this Component with the efforts of the Government and development \npartners, ADB has had discussions on different aspects of this Component with the Office of the \nPresident, the Parliamentary Commissioner (Ombudsmen), the Attorney General, the Secretary, \nand  Additional  Secretary  of  the  Ministry  of  Justice  and  Judicial  Reforms,  the  Provincial \nGovernments of the North East and the South, the Legal Aid Commissioner, senior members of \nthe  Sri  Lankan  judiciary,  the  Asia  Foundation,  the  United  Nations Commission  on  Human \nRights,  the  Registrar  General,  the  Commissioner  of  the  Registration  of  Persons,  and \nrepresentatives from professional associations, including the Retired Judges Association and \nthe International Development Law Association, all of whom who have expressed their particular \nsupport for  different aspects of the work.  As the government and these development partners \nare continuing work in related areas, there will be a need to continue coordination to ensure that \ngovernment and development partner activities continue to complement each others activities.  \nAs for other aspects of TAARP, ADB will support the Government, by coordinating with other \ndevelopment partners, to perform a gap-financing role where Government, or tsunami-affected \npeoples\u2019 needs, including governance and anti-corruption requirements, would otherwise go \nunmet.  \n \n35.  The  Legal  Aid  Commission  has  a  number  of  offices  in  tsunami-affected  areas, \nparticularly in the South, the West and in Colombo.  Prior to the tsunami, the United Nations \nCommission on Human Rights has been coordinating with the Human Rights Commission and \nprovided  legal  assistance  in  the  North  East,  originally  in  conjunction  with  the  Legal  Aid \nCommission. ADB received a particularly strong request for post-tsunami legal assistance and \ndispute resolution support from the Provincial Government in the North and East also received \nsimilar requests in the South, and from others, in order to cope with the magnitude of tsunami \nissues. In addition, the UNDP has an Equal Access to Justice Project conducted in cooperation \nwith  the  Ministry  of  Constitutional  Affairs  and  National  Integration  in  Sri  Lanka.  It  has ", "Appendix 7  81\ncommenced providing roving mobile legal assistance to obtain legal papers in certain tsunami-\naffected districts.  \n \n36.  In relation to dispute resolution, the Asia Foundation has successfully worked with the \nMOJ over a period of years to establish statutory Mediation Boards, which are regarded as a \nsuccessful means of resolving private legal disputes. The Asia Foundation will continue to work \nwith  the  MOJ  post-tsunami,  in  responding  with  Mediation  Boards,  particularly  training  of \nmediators.  \n \n37.  Consistent with the sector approach adopted for the entire Project, ADB\u2019s assistance will \nseek  to  support  good  governance,  anti-corruption,  and  the  legal  and  public  administrative \ninfrastructure through cofinance, and gap filling in geographical or conceptual areas not yet \ncovered, and in areas where ADB has a comparative advantage. ADB will actively coordinate \nwith development partners and the government, minimize duplication, encourage co-financing \nand have a catalytic effect on the provision of additional resources. To provide against the \nduplication of efforts, the allocation of ADB funds for this component may be adjusted to ensure \ndelivery of a balanced and demand-responsive governance assistance.  \n \nI.  Disbursement Arrangements \n38.  Immediately after the effective date, the MOJ will establish a first generation grant \nimprest account at the Central Bank. This account will fund the second-generation imprest \naccount to be established for the Office of the President at a bank to be agreed upon by the \nMOJ and ADB.  The initial amount to be deposited into the first generation grant imprest \naccount  will  not  exceed  10%  of  the  Grant  Amount  for  Component  A,  or  the  estimated \nexpenditure for the succeeding 6 months whichever is less.  The advance to be deposited into \nthis imprest account shall not exceed $50,000, or the estimated expenditure for the succeeding \n6 months whichever is less. \n \n ", "82  Appendix 7 \nTable A7.1: Priority Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Program for Courts and Judges \nQuarters in Tsunami-affected Disaster Areas \n \nPublic Service  Rupees \nLocation  Type of Building  Comments \nAffected  (million) \nMagistrates Bungalow (Galle \nBalapitiya  Court Function  2.5  Rehabilitation \nRoad) \nBalapitiya  Court Building  Court Function  1.5  Rehabilitation \nGalle Fort  Galle Court Buildings  Court Function  3.0  Rehabilitation \nMagistrates Bungalow (Beach \nMatara   Residence Facility  3.5  Rehabilitation \nRoad) \nMatara   High Court   Court Function  6.0  Rehabilitation \nMatara  District Court  Court Function  2.0  Rehabilitation \nMatara Fort  Court Buildings  Court Function  10.0  Rehabilitation \nMatara  Labor Tribunals  L.T.

The risks of weak governance and corruption in the Tsunami-affected Areas Rebuilding \nProject  (TAARP)  and  the  North  East  Community  Restoration  and  Development  Project  II \n(NECORD-II) are a concern. ADB\u2019s interventions in these projects seek to comprehensively \naddress these risks and balance the need for expeditious processing of ADB\u2019s assistance, while \nensuring and maintaining the integrity of the post-tsunami and post-conflict reconstruction and \nrehabilitation programs through a number of special project design features.  \n \nA.  Governance and Corruption Risks  \n \n2.  Ensuring  good  governance  and  anticorruption  measures  are  key  features  of  ADB\u2019s \npoverty reduction strategy and are priorities in all ADB-financed projects. The volume and scale \nof foreign assistance now being contributed to Sri Lanka could lead to governance breakdown \nand weaknesses in the law and administration of justice system. The size of public donor and \nprivate contributions provide opportunities for private individuals and public officials to take \nadvantage of people made vulnerable by the tsunami. The loss of documents and records, such \nas  property  titles,  birth  certificates,  death  certificates,  and  identification  cards  make  such \nopportunities even more likely. Individuals have already reportedly assumed multiple personal \nidentities to register for relief at more than one location. The final resolution of property disputes, \nand the award of custody of children can only be resolved in Sri Lankan courts, which is likely to \nencumber  a  legal  system  already  overburdened  with  delayed  cases,  and  may  exacerbate \ninadequacies.  \n \nB.  Governance and Anticorruption Strategies  \n \n3.  TAARP and NECORD-II seek to confront these risks with a series of measures that \nemphasize  the  transparency,  participation,  and  accountability  required  under  the  disaster \npolicy.1 \n \n1.  Accounting and Procurement  \n \n4.  Accounting Capacity. The capacity of the projects\u2019 project management units and \ndistrict project management units to follow good accounting practices is being strengthened by \nhiring more accountants. Accounting training will be provided to further strengthen capacity. \nGood financial practice supports sound management and governance.  \n \n5.  Procurement. ADB has been advising the National Procurement Agency on measures \nto streamline and accelerate procurement without sacrificing transparency and competition. \nConsultant  support  will  be  provided  through  TAARP  to  continue  and  formalize  procedural \nimprovements without compromising integrity.  \n \n2.  Supervision and Monitoring  \n \n6.  Supervision  and  Monitoring.  As  required  by  the  disaster  policy,  TAARP  and \nNECORD-II provide for additional supervision and monitoring. Internal regular and random \nsupervision and monitoring are required. Specific requirements for community participation in \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Manila. Para. 108.  ", "Appendix 8  85\nthe selection, preparation, implementation, and monitoring of subprojects are included. Such \nmonitoring and community participation have been budgeted into each project\u2019s costs.  \n \n7.  Audits. TAARP and NECORD-II provide for private sector financial auditors, in order to \nhave audited accounts provided to ADB within 6 months of the end of the financial year rather \nthan the usual 9 months. TAARP and NECORD II also provide for special and random financial \nand performance audits to ensure that finances are used for their intended purposes. These \ninclude spot and random audits, and semiannual external performance audits, which have been \nincluded within the project costs. As required by the disaster policy, TAARP and NECORD-II \nprovide for a special post-completion audit to address governance, financial accountability, and \ntransparency. These will be funded by the Government.  \n \n3.  Transparency \n \n8.  Tsunami Assistance Information. The TAARP will help the Government  \n \n(i)  establish an internet website that describes or has links to tsunami assistance \nand the administration of funds under all tsunami assistance projects in order to \nprovide  the  public  with  information  and  ensure  that  funds  are  used  for  the \nintended beneficiaries and purposes; \n \n(ii)  publish such information in Sinhala, Tamil, and English in the Government\u2019s \nLakehouse Group of newspapers;  \n \n(iii)  provide information concerning tsunami affected people and communities that \nwill receive assistance, and the contract details for each contract to be procured \nunder the TAARP, on the tsunami website, and in a readily accessible public \nplace in each tsunami-affected project area, and in each PMU office, and in \ngovernment newspapers.  \n \n9.  Identification Cards. TAARP will help the Government, through the Department of the \nRegistrar of Persons, reissue tsunami-affected people with a national identification card. The \ndepartment is now reissuing these cards, but TAARP will provide computers to modernize \nrecords, and incidental support. If required, TAARP will also provide for mobile-van services to \nvisit  tsunami-affected  areas.  In  the  short  term,  temporary  identification  cards  for  tsunami-\naffected people are planned to be issued and provided, as an important measure to minimize \nfalse claims for assistance, and in order to assist tracking of applications for other documents \nand assistance.  \n \n4.  Participation \n \n10.  Local Stakeholders. TAARP and NECORD-II will facilitate an extensive consultative \nand participatory process in subproject selection, design, implementation, and monitoring. Local \nstakeholders are involved in subproject selection, preparation, and implementation. Civil-society \norganizations (CSOs) and NGOs will be represented on the provincial project coordination \ncommittee that approves the selection of subprojects. Different CSOs and NGOs will be eligible \nto be engaged as performance monitors, and any CSO or NGO engaged in providing goods or \nservices under each project will be subject to audit.  \n \n11.  Development Partners. ADB has coordinated closely with other donors, including the \nWorld Bank, JBIC, and other bilateral partners, international organizations, including the United ", "86  Appendix 8 \nNations  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees,  the  Government,  and  provincial  and  local \ngovernments, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, NGOs (including the Asia Foundation), and \nother stakeholders to ensure effective delivery of tsunami assistance, avoid duplication and \nobtain synergies.  \n \n5.  Accountability \n \n12.  Legal  Facilitation  and  Assistance.  TAARP  will  establish  a  centrally  coordinated, \ndecentralized system for providing legal assistance to tsunami-affected people to ensure that \nthey can obtain lost documents, and are aware of the avenues for resolving family, custody, and \nproperty disputes resulting from the tsunami.  \n \n13.  Corruption Sanctioning. Under TAARP, and NECORD II, the Government has agreed \nto quickly sanction private individuals, entities, or public officials who take or attempt to take \nadvantage of donor funds or the vulnerability of tsunami-affected people, in accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s policy of zero tolerance for corruption specifically in tsunami-related activities.  \n \n14.  Bribery and Corruption Commission. Under TAARP, the Government has agreed to \nestablish a division within the administrative division of Sri Lanka\u2019s Bribery and Corruption \nCommission, to concentrate on the detection, investigation, and response to tsunami-related \ncorruption.  \n \n15.  Parliamentary Commissioner (Ombudsmen) / Tsunami Ombudsmen. TAARP would \nsupport either the extension of the existing ombudsmen\u2019s role to cover grievances against \npublic  officials  related  to  the  tsunami,  or  establish  a  decentralized  office  of  the  tsunami \nombudsmen to do so, if requested by the Government.  \n \n16.  Mediation Boards. TAARP would support a decentralized system of dispute resolution \nin tsunami-affected areas to deal with the anticipated increase in tsunami-related disputes. It will \nsettle private disputes and may deal with citizen grievance against governments.  \n \n17.  Modernization and Streamlining of Government Manual Record-keeping Systems. \nTAARP supports the computer automation of manual systems of tsunami-related information, \nthus increasing reliability and predictability of access to such information, limiting the extent to \nwhich the system can be manipulated for false claims for assistance, and increasing the extent \ntsunami affected people can claim public accountability for administration of records. \n \n6.  Predictability \n \n18.  Reconstruction  of  Legal  Infrastructure.  Quasi-judicial  mechanisms  only  work \neffectively in the shadow of the formal legal system. The immediate needs for reconstructing \ndamaged  courts  in  tsunami-affected  areas  would  be  rehabilitated,  together  with  law \nenforcement structures. TAARP permits certain urgent reconstruction of courthouses, prisons, \nand police stations.  \n \n19.  Judicial/Magistrate and Law Enforcement Officer Training Workshops. Judges and \nmagistrates  in  tsunami-affected  areas  will  need  orientation  on  any  new  tsunami  related \nlegislation, and on the likely property and child-custody cases that are likely to arise. TAARP \nprovides support for this.  \n ", "Appendix 8  87\n20.  Reconstruction  of  Administrative  Infrastructure.  The  Registrar  General\u2019s \nDepartment, that registers births, deaths, and marriages, will be supported in reconstructing \nbirth, death, and marriage records, as well as property title documents by purchasing filing \ncabinets, computer technology, and photocopiers for the Central Records Room in Colombo. \nTAARP will permit urgent reconstruction of the Matara and Mullaittivu land and district registry \noffices of the Registrar General and the damaged civil registration section of the divisional \nsecretariats of the Registrar General in Welligama, Hikkaduwa, and Pottuvil.  \n \n21.  Public  Knowledge  of  the  Law.  By  facilitating  publication  in  newspapers  and  the \ninternet of tsunami-related laws passed, and a public and district official awareness campaign, \nTAARP promotes predictability.  \n ", "88          Appendix 9a\nTSUNAMI AFFECTED AREAS REBUILDING PROJECT\nDetailed Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n($ million)\nProject Tsunami ADF Government\nCost Grant Reallocation  & Beneficiaries\nTotal FX LC\nA.

The  proposed  projects  will  support  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  in  the  recovery, \nreconstruction, and rehabilitation process in tsunami-affected areas nationwide and in conflict-\naffected areas of the Northern and Eastern provinces. The recovery and rebuilding process \ninvolves  the  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  housing,  health  facilities,  schools,  water \nsupplies,  irrigation  facilities,  roads,  coastal  structures,  fisheries  infrastructure,  government \noffices, and institutional infrastructure. Most of the works associated with rebuilding the above \nwill occur on preexisting sites. However, some rebuilding in the course of either project might \ntake place on government land or land acquired under the Land Acquisition Act.  \n \n3.  Damage caused by the tsunami on individual properties and livelihoods has exacerbated \nthe damage caused by ethnic conflicts in some locations in the Northern and Eastern provinces. \nAccording to the initial needs assessments,1 the tsunami has destroyed about 100,000 houses, \nand partially damaged over 46,000 houses. Pre-tsunami ethnic conflicts had damaged over the \n50,000 houses in the conflict-affected areas.2 The tsunami-affected people live in temporary \ncamps. The Government\u2019s initiative for the tsunami-affected people is to provide (i) livelihood \ngrant to restart livelihoods, (ii) a housing grant and loan to rebuild the destroyed or damaged \nhouse,  and  (iii)  a  plot  of  land  for  those  who  are  relocated.  The  Tsunami-affected  Areas \nRebuilding  Project  (TAARP)  will  assist  the  Government  in  returning  tsunami-affected \nhouseholds in situ\u2014to their original places of residence\u2014through cash grants in accordance \nwith current tsunami housing reconstruction policy for rebuilding their shelter. As part of the \ncommunity  development subcomponents under the TAARP, assistance will be provided to \nhouseholds for assistance in restarting their livelihoods. TAARP will rebuild damaged basic, \ncommunity, and institutional infrastructure in the tsunami-affected areas. Through the North \nEast Community Restoration and Development Project II (NECORD-II), the Government will \nreconstruct damaged in conflict-affected areas, assist the rehabilitation of basic needs such as \nhealth, education, irrigation, agriculture, replace damaged or destroyed shelter in situ, and \nrebuild community infrastructure and income-generating programs.  \n \n4.  The tsunami affected a few communities of coastal Veddas\u2014indigenous people\u2014in the \nTrincomalee district of the Eastern Province. The TAARP will address their specific needs, if \nnecessary,  in  the  context  of  their  specific  social  and  cultural  system.  In  such  case,  an \nindigenous peoples development plan (IPDP) will be prepared to address the potential impacts \non these communities according to the agreed indigenous peoples development framework \n(IPDF), included as Appendix 15.  \n \n                                                 \n1  A joint needs assessment commenced in early January 2005, and the preliminary report was presented on 28 \nJanuary  2005.  The  needs  assessment  is  attached  as  a  supplementary  appendix  to  the  Report  and \nRecommendation to the President.  \n2  Government of Sri Lanka, ADB, United Nations, and World Bank. 2003. Sri Lanka Assessment of Needs in the \nConflict Affected Areas. Colombo.   ", "94  Appendix 12 \n5.  Combined, the projects will assist the reconstruction and rehabilitation of about 7,000 \nhouses, enabling some tsunami-affected households to return to their original residences. The \nbeneficiary selection and housing grants will be in accordance with the Government\u2019s policy3 on \ntsunami reconstruction. The housing program will be supplemented by the programs of basic \nsocial infrastructures, livelihood improvement, and gender development. Social infrastructure \nincludes the rebuilding of damaged roads, coastal structures, and fisheries harbors.  \n \nB.  Project Components with Resettlement Impacts  \n \n6.  Housing.  To  the  extent  possible,  the  Government  will  assist  the  tsunami-affected \nhouseholds  to  rebuild  their  dwellings,  where  they  existed  when  the  tsunami  hit  them  in \nDecember 2004. The housing program is of two components: a cash grant and access to easy-\nterm  loans.4  Each  tsunami-affected  household  at  eligible  locations  will  receive  a  phased \npayment of a cash grant (different grants for fully damaged and partially damaged houses), and \nan additional housing loan. The timing, pace, content, and extent of house rebuilding will be \nmanaged  by  the  household  with  the  assistance  of  civil-society  organizations  (CSOs)  and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs). The Government will provide relevant information on \npossible house type plans, construction costs and techniques, and access to demonstration \nunits5. Local CSOs will coordinate the housing program, and such coordination will include \ninterface between households, local governments, building material suppliers and local micro \nand small-scale building contractors.  \n \n7.  Some locations may need large-scale reconstruction, and as a result, will require the \nengagement of centralized and large-scale building contractors (footnote 5). Rehabilitation of \nsuch communities may require the relocation of all households. For such relocation, the Urban \nDevelopment  Authority  (UDA)  has  identified  Government  land,  Government  agency-owned \nland, and private land. Most of the land for relocation will be unoccupied Government land. In \nthe event that suitable Government land is not available, UDA will acquire land under Land \nAcquisition Act through consultation and negotiations and will pay the land its replacement \nvalue, as prescribed by the national involuntary resettlement policy. In such cases, the guiding \nprinciples will be, to the extent possible, to keep the tsunami-affected communities at their \noriginal locations. The main guiding principle in allocating land plots is that all tsunami-affected \nhouseholds will be given to both titled and non-titled households.  \n \n8.  The  following  operational  principles  will  be  applied  in  implementing  the  above \ncommunity-level programs:  \n \n (i)  At resettlement sites, tsunami-affected communities will involve in selecting new \nlocations for community infrastructure and housing and in deciding layout and \ninfrastructure  designs.  This  process  will  be  facilitated  by  CSOs,  chosen  by \ntsunami-affected communities.  \n(ii)  Each household will supervise and manage the construction of its dwelling at its \noriginal site or on the assigned land plot.  \n                                                 \n3  The Government provides livelihood and housing grant through the Unified Assistance Scheme.  \n4  Sri Lanka\u2019s experience with housing reconstruction after the large-scale flooding in the Southern Province (where \naround 17,000 houses are being assisted through cash grants) and lessons learned during the preparation of the \nWorld Bank-supported North East Housing Reconstruction Project (NEHRP) support this approach. \n5  The Urban Development Authority of Ministry of Urban Development and Water Supply has recommended four \ntypes  of  houses\u2014single-story  detached  houses  on  individual  land  plots,  single-story  attached  houses  with \nindividual gardens, two-story attached terraced houses with individual gardens and multi-story walk-up apartments. ", "Appendix 12  95\n(iii)  If  large-scale  reconstruction  is  involved,  community  input  will  be  obtained  in \nchoosing building type and floor plan and in construction supervision.  \n(iv)  The elderly, the disabled, households headed by women, and/or households that \nare unable to manage cash grants or loans will be directly assisted by UDA to \nconstruct houses. Such households will not be isolated, and to the extent possible \nwill be encouraged to remain with their original communities. Provisions will be \nprovided  for  tsunami-affected  women  to  obtain  housing  grants  and  livelihood \nrestoration assistance.  \n(v)  Titles of new land plots, housing and other structures and livelihood assistance \nsuch as fishing boats will be registered as household assets of the tsunami-\naffected persons\u2014husband and wife as co-owners.  \n(vi)  House construction will consider the possibility of using local building materials \nand  local manpower  as  far  as  possible.  To  minimize  the  cost  to the  natural \nenvironment and natural resources, alternative construction materials, particularly \nfor sand and timber, will be introduced. The construction of more than 100,000 \nhouseholds will demand considerable quantities of such building materials within \na very short period of time.  \n \n9.  In housing programs, particularly in large-scale community-driven housing programs, the \nconstruction process will be streamlined. Three processes in this regard are critical: (i) a large \nnumber of tsunami-affected households lost their land titles, bank documents, and identification \ncards. This situation is compounded by the fact that in some districts land registries were \ndamaged, and official records were destroyed by the tsunami. In such cases, a mechanism will \nbe established to ensure that such factors would not unduly delay recovery and reconstruction. \n(ii) A concise, clear and simplified building codes applicable to the reconstruction process will be \ndeveloped. Such building codes will be adopted and will be widely disseminated among the \ntsunami-affected households. (iii) An accelerated process to institutionalize the issuance of \nbuilding permits at local, district, and provincial levels will be established.  \n \n10.  Three issues in respect of construction sector facilitation that need special attention are \n(i) supply of skilled labor at construction sites: initiatives will be provided to support the training \nof skilled construction workers (such as masons, carpenters, plumbers and electricians) through \nvocational training institutional network and through CSOs; (ii) construction materials: Sri Lanka \nwill  require  the  support  of  materials  and  equipment  supply  chains;  (iii)  environmental \nmanagement: an appropriate environmental management response for lime production will be \ninstalled.  \n \n11.  Assistance to Tsunami-affected Local Authorities. At most tsunami-affected coastal \nareas,  local  authorities  often  do  not  have  the  requisite  institutional  capacity  to  effectively \nmanage  large-scale  emergency  assistance  programs.  Therefore,  as  part  of  the  recovery \nprocess, these local authorities will be assisted in developing and mainstreaming consultative \nand inclusive recovery strategies. Project assistance to local authorities includes resources for \ndesign,  rehabilitation  and/or  reconstruction  of  local  infrastructure  such  as  minor  roads, \npathways, solid waste management, and street lighting.  \n \n12.  Public  infrastructure  that  would  receive  assistance  include  national  road,  access \nroads, minor road, culverts, drains, small-scale water supply and sanitation facilities, solid waste \nmanagement,  small-scale  fisheries  related  infrastructure  such  as  net  repair  sheds, \nmarket/auction halls, and cold storage facilities. Although the majority of construction would \ninvolve the reconstruction of infrastructure at its pre-tsunami location, some could necessitate \npermanent or temporary land acquisition.  ", "96  Appendix 12 \n13.  Coastal  Resources  Management.  The  TAARP  will  repair  damage  to  coastal \nstabilization structures and harbor backwaters in the Southern and Western provinces and \nenhance coastal protection and environmental management along the coast by reestablishing \ngreen  zones  or  green  belts  through  intensive  forestation  with  coastal  vegetation.  The \nenforcement of tsunami rebuilding policy and guidelines along the tsunami-affected coast will \ndisplace  persons,  especially  the  squatters  and  encroachers.  Land  acquisition  for  coastal \nresource management, if necessary, will follow the resettlement principles outlined above in \npara 8.  \n \n14.  Livelihood  Restoration.  Under  both  projects,  livelihood  restoration  support  will  be \nprovided to enable tsunami-affected and conflict-affected households to rebuild their livelihood \nsources or to learn new employment skills. This will be done by reviving local economies \nthrough the creation of jobs for locally-based skilled and unskilled labor. Livelihood support \ninterventions  include  advisory  services  to  identify  and  develop  suitable  livelihood  options \nincluding small-scale enterprises, skills development, and transfer of technology. Some of these \nadvisory services will be linked with microcredit. Asset replacement support for disadvantaged \ngroups on a very competitive basis will also a part of this project component.  \n \nC.  Policy Framework and Entitlements \n \n15.  This resettlement framework is based on ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy and \ndisaster and emergency assistance policy, and the national involuntary resettlement policy of Sri \nLanka6. The resettlement framework sets out the broad scope, policy, and procedures for \nscreening and formulation of resettlement plans for subprojects and investments under both \nprojects. The detailed scope of individual subprojects has not yet been defined; however, the \nexecuting agencies (EAs) will be required to prepare, as needed, resettlement plans according \nto this RF, and Government and ADB guidelines for subprojects with any resettlement impacts.7  \n \n16.  Involuntary resettlement principles applicable to the TAARP and NECORD-II are derived \nfrom ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy, the Government\u2019s national involuntary resettlement \npolicy and the Land Acquisition Act. The core principles are:  \n \n(i)  Involuntary  resettlement  will  be  avoided;  if  it  cannot  be  avoided,  it  will  be \nminimized.  \n(ii)  Where involuntary resettlement is unavoidable, tsunami-affected persons will be \nassisted to reestablish themselves and improve their quality of life. \n(iii)  Lack of formal legal land title is not a bar for compensation and rehabilitation \nassistance.  \n(iv)  Replacement land is an option for compensation in the case of loss of land; in the \nabsence of replacement land, cash compensation is the option for all affected \n                                                 \n6  Sri Lanka adopted a national involuntary resettlement policy (NIRP) in May 2001. Under this policy a resettlement \nplan is required if more than 20 households are affected. The project can obtain four sets of guidelines from the \nResettlement Division of the Ministry of Agriculture. Lands, Irrigation and Livestock, to assist the relevant agencies \nin planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating all involuntary resettlement impacts. These are (i) General \nGuidelines on Planning and Implementation of Involuntary Resettlement; (ii) Guidelines for the Preparation of a \nResettlement Action Plan; (iii) Process Manual for the Implementation of the NIRP, Ministry of Land; and (iv) \nGuidelines for a Participatory Resettlement Process. Under the NIRP, the Resettlement Division now requires an \nacceptable RAP before approving any land acquisition for a project.  \n 7  Resettlement impacts includes social and economic impacts that are permanent or temporary and are (i) caused \nby acquisition of land and other fixed assets, (ii) by change in the use of land, or (iii) restrictions imposed on land.  ", "Appendix 12  97\npersons (APs). Compensation for the property acquired will be paid at their \nreplacement value8 in addition to any transaction costs.  \n(v)  Each AP is entitled to receive assistance to restore income and livelihood at pre-\nproject standard, and all vulnerable APs are entitled to receive assistance to \nimprove their income and livelihood.  \n(vi)  All APs will be fully informed and consulted on compensation, relocation, and \nrehabilitation programs.  \n(vii)  APs will fully involve in the selection of relocation sites, livelihood compensation \nand development options at the earliest opportunity.  \n(viii)  All APs will be integrated economically and socially into their host communities, if \nrelocated. For this, participatory measures will be designed and implemented by \nthe EA or IA.  \n(ix)  APs\u2019 social and cultural institutions will be safeguarded and supported.  \n(x)  Common property resources and community and public services will be provided \nto APs.  \n(xi)  Compensation  and  rehabilitation  programs  will  be  carried  out  with  equal \nconsideration  for  women  and  men;  in  the  case  of  these  projects,  particular \nattention will be placed on the rights of women, widows, orphans, and the elderly, \nand other vulnerable persons and groups such as indigenous peoples and ethnic \nminorities. Appropriate and sufficient assistance will be provided to help them \nimprove their socioeconomic status.  \n(xii)  Compensation  and  resettlement  assistance  will  be  fully  provided  before \napproving any subproject if it involves involuntary resettlement impacts.  \n(xiii)  The full compensation and resettlement costs are included in subproject costs.  \n \n17.  Although  the  above  resettlement  principles  could  adequately  address  involuntary \nresettlement arising from subprojects, it is necessary to decide the following policy issues \nrelating primarily to tsunami-affected persons. These issues need policy clarification by the \nGovernment:  \n \n(i)  Beneficiary identification. A national system of identifying the tsunami-affected \nhouseholds who are eligible for receiving assistance is required. The system has \nto be fair, accurate, and verifiable.  \n(ii)   \u201cNo  development  zone.\u201d  Any  blanket  \u201cno  development  zone\u201d  will  impose \nmultiple critical impacts. A policy based on risk assessment, consultations with \nproperty owners, squatters, and informal settlers and on social, economic, and \nfinancial implications is required. This includes the programs associated with the \ngreening of coastal belt and other coastal conservation programs. \n(iii)  Before  permanent  houses  are  built,  it  is  necessary  to  provide  all  displaced \nhouseholds with transitory shelter. The internally displaced persons cannot live in \nmakeshift tents without any privacy and basic hygienic facilities for a long time. \nLand  acquisition,  land  development,  and  construction  of  houses,  and  other \ncommunity facilities could take long time to complete because of legal, financial, \nand institutional obstacles.  \n \n                                                 \n8  Replacement cost means the cost of replacement of lost assets and income. If land, it means the cost of buying a \nreplacement land near the lost land with equal productive potential plus the cost of preparing the land to levels \nsimilar to those of the affected land and cost of any registration and transfer taxes. If structures, it means current \nmarket value of building materials, required labor without deduction for depreciation and/or salvageable materials. \nFor crops and trees, it will be based on economic production, age and type.  ", "98  Appendix 12 \n18.  The application of policy and laws in the sphere of involuntary resettlement are outlined \nbelow. The entitlement matrix is divided into two components: tsunami-caused losses, and \nsubproject-caused losses. The entitlement matrix is not exhaustive: more entitlements can be \nadded  if  any  resettlement  impact  not  listed  in  the  matrix  is  identified  during  project \nimplementation.  \n \nTable A12: Entitlement Matrix \nType of Losses  Entitlement  Implementation Issues \nTsunami-Caused Losses \nPermanent Loss of  \u2022  Land-for-land or cash-for-land for land  Tsunami-affected households have \nhomesteads   lost.

In preparing a resettlement plan (RP), the following procedures will be followed: \n \n(i)  Conduct consultations with all stakeholders to obtain inputs regarding how to avoid \nor minimize involuntary resettlement impacts and identify needs and preferences of \nAPs when formulating the RP.  \n(ii)  Undertake  a  census,  asset  inventory,  and  detailed  measurement  surveys.  A \nsocioeconomic survey of a sample population will also be undertaken to identify \ndifferent  categories  of  APs,  based  on  the  degree  and  scale  of  impacts  of  the \nsubproject on them.  \n(iii)  Formulate a time-bound schedule for RP implementation, procedures for grievance \nredress, monitoring and evaluation (both internal and external). \n(iv)  Develop an entitlements matrix to outline entitlements of all tsunami-affected persons \nincluding non-titled persons, e.g., squatters, encroachers, and informal dwellers. If \nnew  categories  of  APs  and  types  of  losses  are  identified  during  project \nimplementation,  appropriate  entitlements  will  be  added  to  the  resettlement \nframework. \n(v)  Draft RP will be disclosed to all APs. The EA will review and approve it before \nsubmitting to ADB for review and approval. It will be disclosed to all APs and posted \non ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Website.  \n(vi)  The  RP  approved  by  EA  and  ADB  will  be  implemented  before  award  of  any \nconstruction contracts of the subproject.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The executing agencies of TAARP and NECORD-II will be the ministries of finance and \nplanning; relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction; highways; fisheries and aquatic resources; \nregional infrastructure development; urban development and water supply; and justice. The \nNorth East Provincial Council, Southern Provincial Council, Road Development Authority, Coast \nConservation  Department,  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board  and  National \nDevelopment Trust Fund will be implementing agencies (IAs).  \n \n21.  National  and  provincial  and  project  coordination  committees  for  each  project  will \ncoordinate activities with the assistance of district level project management units (PMUs). \nSubprojects will be selected on the basis of established criteria, as established in Appendixes \n5a and 5b. Formulation, implementation, and monitoring of RPs of subprojects will be the \nresponsibility of the concerned EA and IA and their PMU, which will work under the overall \ncoordination of the national and provincial coordination committees. Key information on impacts, \nlocal needs and on tsunami-affected households will be provided by divisional secretaries with ", "Appendix 12  101\nthe help of grama niladharis.10 These village-level government officials will also take part in \nproject implementation together with local authorities and IAs.  \n \n22.  Both  projects  will  engage  domestic  consultants  as  needed  to  prepare  RPs  for \nsubprojects in consultation with EAs and IAs and to monitor RP implementation. They will be \nselected in consultation with ADB. In formulating RPs, the consultants will follow the planning \nprocedures outlined in para. 8 and the entitlement matrix.  \n \nF.  Consultation and Participation \n \n23.  Activities for both projects will be conducted through a stakeholder consultation process, \nassisted by CSOs and NGOs. EAs and IAs will make sure to invite vulnerable households and \npersons  for  such  stakeholder  consultations.  CSOs  and  NGOs  will  document  these \nconsultations, indicating the responsibility and time-line for implementing the decisions taken at \nsuch consultation meetings. Resettlement information during RP preparation will be disclosed to \nall APs in their own language, and their views and opinions will be taken into consideration in \nfinalizing RPs. Final RPs will be translated into local language and disclosed through public \nnotices at PMU field offices, grama niladhari offices, and through news papers, radio, TV and on \nADB\u2019s website.  \n \nG.  Eligibility Provisions \n \n24.  All  APs  are  entitled  to  compensation  and  rehabilitation.  However,  eligibility  to \ncompensation and other assistance will be limited by a cut-off date to be set for each subproject \non the day corresponding to the beginning of its impacts assessment. The cut-off date defines \n\u201celigibility\u201d and \u201caffected person.\u201d APs who arrived in the subproject areas after the cut-off date \nwill not be eligible for compensation and other assistance.  \n \nH.  Grievance Redress Mechanism \n \n25.  The  divisional  secretary  will  handle  grievances,  if  any,  in  implementing  RPs  of \nsubprojects with the assistance of PMUs and grama niladhari. APs could appeal against any \ndecision of divisional secretary to the provincial project coordination committees and national \nproject coordination committee. If unsatisfied, APs could seek assistance of appropriate court of \nlaw  to  redress  their  grievances.  Each  subproject  RP  will  detail  the  grievance  redress \nmechanisms.  \n \nI.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n26.

The Tsunami-affected Areas Rebuilding Project (TAARP) and the North East Community \nRestoration  and  Development  Project  II  (NECORD-II)  aim  to  support  the  Government\u2019s \nrebuilding efforts in the wake of the tsunami, and continuing rehabilitation efforts in the conflict-\naffected areas in the North East, respectively. Subprojects will be implemented through project \nimplementation units (PMUs) under various implementing agencies, all now in existence for \nother ongoing ADB-financed projects. While most of the subprojects are similar in scope to \nongoing projects, a few that are not have been introduced for possible implementation under \nTAARP and NECORD-II. This initial environmental examination has been developed for the \nbroad framework of TAARP and NECORD-II, as they address similar reconstruction needs and \nuse  similar  approaches  to  implement  the  works.  However,  during  subproject  formulation, \nenvironmental  concerns  will  be  studied  in  further  detail.  An  environmental  assessment \nframework has been developed (Appendix 12) to ensure that subprojects follow environmental \nassessment  procedures,  in  keeping  with  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  environmental \nassessment regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002).  \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.  The TAARP and NECORD-II will reconstruct damaged or destroyed infrastructure and \nessential services primarily by providing civil works, equipment, and consulting services. TAARP \nwill introduce measures to enhance environmental protection along the coastal belt. Subprojects \ninclude  rehabilitating  damaged  roads  ranging  from  classes  A  to  E;1  rehabilitating  basic \ncommunity infrastructure (schools, hospitals, housing, health facilities, and local government \nbuildings,  including  small  markets);  rehabilitating  irrigation  schemes;2  preparing  and \nimplementing  village  development  plans;  providing  support  for  livelihood  activities; \nreconstructing coastal protection interventions such as groins, revetments, and embankments; \nrehabilitating damaged harbors; enhancing coastal protection by reestablishing vegetation in \ncoastal  zones;  and  expanding  and  rehabilitating  community  water  supply  and  sanitation \nschemes. TAARP will support rural microfinance credit schemes.  \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n1.  Physical Resources \n \n3.  Sri Lanka sits on a narrow continental shelf 45 kilometers (km) wide in the northeastern \nand northwestern coasts and 8 km along the southeastern and eastern coasts. The country has \nan  area  of  44,250  square  kilometers.  The  northern  shelf  merges  with  India,  forming  an \nextensive shallow bank consisting of the Gulf of Mannar, Palk Strait, and Pedro Bank. The \ncoastline is 1,770 km.  \n \n4.  The  climate  is  influenced  by  two  monsoon  and  two  inter-monsoon  periods.  The \nsouthwest monsoon, which occurs from May to September, is associated with cyclonic wind \ncirculations or depressions and is marked by heavy rainfall, especially in the southwestern \nseaboard. The northeast monsoon occurs from December to February, and is characterized by \nheavy rainfall more or less confined in the northeastern half of the country, with wind generally \n                                                 \n1  All road rehabilitation will be within the existing right-of-way and will not include widening or realignment.  \n2  Irrigation works will not involve changes or diversion of natural watercourse.  ", "104  Appendix 13 \ncoming from an easterly direction. Wind becomes generally light during the two inter-monsoon \nperiods\u2014March to April, and October to November. The average temperature of the project \narea ranges from 290C to 370C.  \n \n2.  Ecological Resources \n \n5.  The natural ecosystems within the coastal zone are diverse and include lagoons and \nestuaries, coral reefs, mangrove swamps, seagrass beds, other wetlands and dune systems. \nThe country\u2019s principal coral reef systems are composed of fringing reefs close to the shore. \nSeveral offshore reefs are on the continental shelf off the northwestern coast. Destructive \nfishing practices and human-induced activities such as siltation and pollution have led to the \ndestruction of the coral reefs. Cumulative damage to mangroves in Sri Lanka has resulted from \noverutilization of the resource and the transformation of large areas for other uses. Mangroves \nhave been converted for aquaculture, coconut, and paddy cultivation, and reclaimed for housing \nand urban expansion. The impact the tsunami has had on these natural systems is yet to be \nstudied.  \n \n6.  Sri Lanka is estimated to have over 23,800 hectares of salt marsh lands. Salt marshes in \nthe north are found mostly on tidal flats, while in the south, they occur mainly in low areas on the \nsheltered sides of sand dunes. The coastal marshes and wetlands are feeding grounds for \nmigratory waterfowl. Within the tsunami- and conflict-affected areas, around 15 sites have been \nformally designated as protected areas and sanctuaries.  \n \n7.  Cultural landmarks include temples, mosques, churches, and 16th\u201317th-century Dutch \nand Portuguese forts.  \n \n3.  Human and Economic Development \n \n8.  The main economic activities of the affected communities are fisheries and tourism. The \ncontribution of fisheries, hotels, and restaurants together is only 3% to GDP. However, the \ncoastal  economy  is  largely  dependent  on  these  sectors  and  many  of  the  small  informal \nbusinesses in these areas also service these industries. The agriculture sector in these regions, \nwhich was less affected, consists of small-scale farmers. The coastal communities are largely \npoor, with the North East communities suffering from the added burden of a 20-year civil war.  \n \n9.  Human development in Sri Lanka is higher than in comparable countries, with a literacy \nrate of 92% and life expectancy at 73 years. The net enrolment rate in primary education is \n96%. Even in the poor regions the level of human development is satisfactory due to the \nuniversal free education and health policies that the country has followed for a long time. \nHowever, the quality of facilities differs greatly across the regions, and poor communities have \nless access to higher education and good medical services.  \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n10.  As the main focus of each project is to rehabilitate or rebuild infrastructure and essential \nservices  damaged  or  destroyed  either  by  the  tsunami  or  the  conflict,  an  overall  positive \nenvironmental impact is expected.  \n \n11.  Reconstruction works of almost all infrastructure facilities, including harbors, markets, \nschools, other than some individual housing, will be at original sites. Roads will be through the \noriginal right-of-way, and a change in alignment or widening of roads is not anticipated. Coastal ", "Appendix 13  105\n \nstabilization  will  focus  on  replacing  displaced  boulders  and  reconstructing  groins  and \nrevetments. Water supply and sanitation subprojects will focus on repairing damaged structures \nand extending the coverage. Negative environmental impacts during construction, including \nincreased dust, noise, temporary disruption of traffic flow, and soil erosion, will be short term \nand can be mitigated by suitable construction practices. Measures to minimize the impacts will \nbe included in the contract documents. A resettlement framework has been developed to ensure \nthat any resettlement that may occur under the projects will follow the procedures laid out in \nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995).  \n \n12.  Apart  from  reconstruction  works,  measures  to  improve  the  environment  will  be \nincorporated  into  the  subproject  designs.  Reestablishing  coastal  green  belts  with  suitable \nvegetation is proposed. Immediately after the tsunami, NGOs and local government authorities \nhelped  sort  and  dispose  of  the  large  quantities  of  waste.  While  the  tsunami-affected \ncommunities have salvaged whatever building materials that could be reused, large quantities of \nconstruction debris\u2014broken bricks, concrete\u2014remain stockpiled. It is proposed, where feasible, \nto reuse this as core material to rebuild groins and revetments, or to crush and reuse it as sub-\nbase material for access roads to be constructed under TAARP and NECORD-II. This will help \nminimize  problems  of  waste  disposal  and  the  impacts  on  natural  resources  as  more  raw \nmaterial is used for reconstruction.  \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements, Environmental Mitigation, and Monitoring Plan \n \n13.  In  keeping  with  the  environmental  assessment  requirements  of  the  Government \nstipulated  in  the  National  Environmental  Act  and  Coast  Conservation  Act  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002), subprojects determined as requiring environmental assessments will \nneed  approval  of  the  project  approving  agency  and  ADB.  An  environmental  assessment \nframework  has  been  developed  to  help  determine  which  subprojects  will  require  an  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE).  \n \n14.  Preparation of the IEE and obtaining the necessary approvals will be the responsibility of \nthe PMU. The PMU must also ensure that mitigation measures identified in the environmental \nmanagement plan are incorporated during implementation. Contract documents shall describe \nthe environmental obligations of the contractor and penalties for noncompliance. While most \nPMUs under these projects are supported by consultants, or have their own staff to monitor the \nimplementation of the environmental management plan, they may obtain additional consultancy \nservices if required.  \n \n15.  Quarterly  progress  review  reports  submitted  by  the  implementing  agencies  to  ADB \nshould include the progress of environmental monitoring and highlight any other environmental \nissues that may have arisen during implementation, and measures taken to address the issues.  \n \nF.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n \n16.  Given the emergency nature of TAARP, detailed public consultations in tsunami-affected \nareas  could  not  be  held  although  public  consultations  and  beneficiary  participation  are  a \nnecessary and integrated initial step in subproject selection. However, during the tsunami fact-\nfinding and needs assessment missions, consultations were held with government officials, the \nLiberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, NGOs, other bilateral organizations, and a few tsunami-\naffected persons.  \n17.  In the planning and implementation of subprojects, beneficiary communities shall be \nconsulted to ensure that their concerns and needs are addressed in the rehabilitation of the ", "106  Appendix 13 \nworks. During the consultation, project information should be shared with the beneficiaries. All \ncontractual  information  on  ongoing  subprojects  should  be  clearly  posted  at  subproject \nconstruction sites, including the exact contract amount and dates. All environmental documents \nare subject to public disclosure; therefore, these documents should be made available to the \npublic, in accordance with ADB\u2019s public communications policy. \n \nG.  Environmental Assessment and Review Procedures of Subprojects \n \n18.  The environmental assessment and review procedures are described in Appendix 14. All \nsubprojects related to rehabilitation of class-A and -B roads, class-C to -E roads over 5 km, \nlocal access roads, harbors, and community water supply and sanitation schemes, and to \nresettlement of communities have been classified as category-B projects and require an IEE. \nOther subprojects will be subject to environmental screening. Subprojects will be designed so \nthat they comply with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and are in keeping with the relevant \ngovernmental laws, regulations, and standards.  \n \nH.  Conclusion \n \n19.  The  TAARP  and  NECORD-II  focus  primarily  on  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of \ninfrastructure. Short-term, reversible, minor negative impacts are anticipated as a result of \nconstruction. These can be mitigated by adopting good construction practices and incorporating \nmitigatory measures during design and construction, and including clauses in the contract \ndocuments. Significant environmental benefits are anticipated through subproject interventions, \nincluding improvements in water supply and sanitation, coastal protection, and provision of \nbasic services. TAARP and NECORD-II are environmental category-B projects. Subprojects will \nbe  subject  to  environmental  screening.  The  IEE  shows  that  no  significant  adverse \nenvironmental impacts are foreseen to be associated with the proposed rehabilitation work and, \ntherefore,  a  full-scale  environmental  impact  assessment  of  further  impacts  of  TAARP  or \nNECORD-II is unlikely to be required.  \n ", "Appendix 14  107\nENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  Subprojects proposed for the Tsunami-affected Areas Rebuilding Project (TAARP) and \nthe North East Community Restoration and Development Project (NECORD-II) will support the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to rehabilitate essential infrastructure and services damaged or destroyed \nas a result of the tsunami impact and the conflict in the North East.  \n \n2.  Subprojects  collectively  under  TAARP  and  NECORD-II  can  include  rehabilitating \ndamaged class A to class E roads;1 rehabilitating basic community infrastructure (schools, \nhospitals, housing, health facilities, and local government buildings, including small markets); \nrehabilitating  irrigation  schemes;2  preparing  and  implementing  village  development  plans; \nproviding support for livelihood activities; reconstructing coastal protection interventions such as \ngroins,  revetments,  and  embankments;  rehabilitating  damaged  harbors;  enhancing  coastal \nprotection by planting vegetation in recently declared coastal reservation zones;3 and expanding \nand rehabilitating community water supply and sanitation schemes. TAARP will support rural \nmicrofinance credit schemes. Subprojects that are part of the original scope of either project will \nfollow the environmental procedures stipulated in their loan agreements. Where subprojects do \nnot fall within the existing scope, the environmental assessment procedures to be adopted are \ndetailed in the following paragraphs.  \n \n3.  Environmental assessment requirements of the Government for subprojects outside the \ncoastal zone4 are stipulated in the National Environmental Act (NEA) 47 of 1980, incorporating \namendments by Act 56 of 1988 and Act 53 of 2000, while those within the coastal zone are \ngoverned by the Coast Conservation Act 57 of 1981, incorporating amendment Act 64 of 1988. \nIn accordance with the NEA, environmental assessments are required for prescribed projects.5 \nPrescribed projects are identified as type (i) projects based on type and magnitude; type (ii) all \nsubprojects irrespective of their magnitude identified in (i); and type (iii) selected high-polluting \nindustries, if near culturally and/or environmentally sensitive areas defined in Table A14. Given \nthat subprojects focus on rehabilitating infrastructure and services, none fall within type (i) \nprescribed  projects.  Nevertheless,  all  subprojects  will  be  screened  for  type  (ii)  prescribed \nprojects using the checklist provided. All subproject interventions within the coastal zone require \nthe  approval  of  the  Coast  Conservation  Department  (CCD).  The  director  of  CCD  has  the \ndiscretion to request the developer to submit an environmental impact assessment (EIA) In \naddition, under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance 2 of 1937, amended by Act 49 of \n1993, any new development activity within 1 mile (1.609 km of the boundary of a national \nreserve  requires  prior  written  approval  of  the  director  of  the  Department  of  Wildlife \nConservation.  \n \n4.  As  both  projects  will  focus  on  restoring  facilities  damaged  or  destroyed  during  the \ntsunami and conflict, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) \n                                                 \n1  All road rehabilitation will be within the existing right-of-way and will not include widening or realignment.  \n2  Irrigation works will not involve changes or diversion of natural watercourse.  \n3  The Government has proposed a 100-meter wide reservation zone. \n4  Defined in the Coast Conservation Act as \u201cthe area lying within a 300 m landwards of the mean of the mean high \nwater line and a limit of 2 km seawards of the mean low water line and in the case of rivers, streams, lagoons, or \nany other body of water connected to the sea either permanently or periodically, the landward boundary shall \nextend to a limit of 2 km measure perpendicular to the straight base line drawn between the natural entrance points \nthereof and shall include waters of such rivers, streams and lagoons or any other body of water so connected to \nthe sea.\u201d  \n5  Listed in Gazette Extraordinary of 772/22 of 24 June 1993.  ", "108  Appendix 14 \nand Environment Policy (2002), [all subprojects related to rehabilitation of class-A and -B roads, \nclass-C through -E roads over 5 kilometers (km), and local access roads; harbors; community \nwater supply and sanitation schemes; and resettlement of communities have been classified as \ncategory B subprojects and require an IEE. All remaining subprojects will be subject to an \nenvironmental screening procedure described in para. 7. Each category B subproject needs an \nIEE. Any category B subproject falling within the Government\u2019s list of prescribed projects, or \nwithin 1.6 km of the boundary of a national reserve, will need to obtain relevant governmental \nclearances and submit them to ADB. All subprojects falling within the coastal zone will require \nprior approval of CCD.  \n \n5.  After  the  tsunami,  the  Central  Environmental  Authority  issued  guidelines  for  waste \ndisposal and housing reconstruction. The project management units (PMUs) should ensure that \nall activities are in keeping with these guidelines and any new guidelines the Government may \npropose.  \n \n6.  To comply with the Government\u2019s and the ADB\u2019s environmental impact assessment \nrequirements, the following environmental assessment framework will be adopted.  \n \nB.  Subproject Selection and Environmental Assessment \n \n7.  Subprojects for which an environmental assessment category has not been identified, as \ndefined in para. 4, will be subject to an environmental checklist (Table A14). Reconstruction for \ncoastal  areas  affected  by  the  tsunami  will  comply  with  the  Government\u2019s  post-tsunami \nreconstruction guidelines and regulations. If any subprojects fall within areas specified in the \nchecklist, they will be categorized as a category B and will require an IEE.  \n \n8.  For each category B subproject, a simplified IEE report must be submitted to ADB as \npart of the subproject proposal. The simplified IEE report, in a checklist format, developed for \nthe North East Community Restoration and Development Project (NECORD) will be made \navailable to the PMUs during the inception of TAARP and NECORD-II.  \n \n9.  For each category B subproject in the sensitive areas (Table A14), the simplified IEE \nreport must be submitted to the project approving agency6 for clearance. Such clearance must \nbe obtained before subproject implementation.  \n \nC.  Responsibilities of Implementing Agencies and ADB  \n \n10.  The following review procedure will be adopted to facilitate identification and mitigation \nof potential environmental problems and risks related to each subproject:  \n \n1.  Implementing Agencies\u2019 Responsibilities \n \n11.  The implementing agencies\u2019 responsibilities are the following: \n \n(i)  Determine  the  environmental  category  of  the  subproject  based  on  the \ncategorization in para. 4.

Whether or not the subproject required an IEE, basic environmental safeguards to be \nadopted during construction shall be included in the contract documents. For subprojects that \nrequire an IEE, the contract documents shall also include clauses for the implementation of \nenvironmental mitigation measures as described in the IEE report and the approving agency \nclearance (if required).  \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s Responsibilities \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s responsibilities are the following: \n \n(i)  Review IEE reports and approve qualifying subprojects.  \n(ii)  Disclose the findings of the IEE and summary IEE in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002).  \n(iii)  Monitor  the  implementation  of  mitigation  measures  through  project  review \nmissions, and conduct environmental performance monitoring as necessary.  \n \nD.  Environmental Performance Monitoring and Public Disclosure \n \n14.  The  implementing  agencies  must  ensure  that  ADB  is  given  access  to  undertake \nenvironmental monitoring of all subprojects. However, the agencies have the full responsibility \nfor  monitoring  and  reporting  to  ADB  on  the  implementation  of  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures described in the IEE report and approving agency clearance (if required). While most \nof the PMUs under these projects are supported by consultants, or have their own staff to \nmonitor the implementation of the environmental management plan, they may obtain additional \nconsultancy services, if required.  \n \n15.  Quarterly progress review reports submitted by the implementing agency should include \nthe progress of environmental monitoring and highlight any other environmental issues that may \nhave arisen during implementation, and measures taken to address the issues.  \n \n16.  Each  implementing  agency  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  environmental \nassessment  documents,  including  the  environmental  monitoring  reports,  are  maintained \nsystematically as part of the subproject record.  \n \n17.  During  planning  and  implementation,  beneficiary  communities  shall  be  consulted  to \nensure that their concerns and needs are addressed in the rehabilitation of the works. During \nthe  consultation  process,  project  information  should  be  shared  with  the  beneficiaries.

Introduction  \n \n1.  The tsunami seriously damaged the Western and Northeastern coastal areas of Sri \nLanka. A needs assessment has been completed to assess the damages to property, livelihood \nand infrastructure. In a response a request for emergency assistance, ADB has prepared two \ninterlinked  projects:  Tsunami-affected  Areas  Rebuilding  Project  (TAARP)  and  North  East \nCommunity Restoration and Development Project II (NECORD II) comprising components of \nroads, community infrastructure and shelter, livelihood support, water supply and sanitation, and \ncoastal protection. Under these two projects, it is proposed to conduct socioeconomic surveys \nto  identify  and  evaluate  the  socioeconomic  conditions  of  local  communities,  including \nindigenous communities who live in marginalized small coastal communities, and to provide \nreconstruction assistance to rebuild damaged properties and community infrastructure as well \nas livelihood sources through a participatory strategy. The first step is to identify priority areas \nfor immediate interventions. About 150 households of indigenous people (Veddas) have thus far \nbeen  identified  as affected  by  the  tsunami. Many  more  Veddas  living  in  Trincomalee  and \nBatticaloa  districts  might  have  also  been  affected  by  the tsunami;  the  number  of  affected \nindigenous  peoples  could  increase  once  the  socioeconomic  surveys  are  completed.  This \nindigenous peoples development framework (IPDF) has been formulated as the basis for any \nindigenous peoples development plans (IPDPs) that may be needed to address indigenous \npeoples\u2019 issues arising from the subprojects. The IPDF is intended to guide the selection and \npreparation  of  subprojects  under  either  project  to  ensure  better  distribution  of  benefits  to \nindigenous peoples, and rebuild their lost income sources and dwellings.  \n \nB.  Indigenous Groups \n \n2.  \u201dIndigenous peoples\u201d refers to a population with social, cultural, economic, and political \ntraditions and institutions distinct from the mainstream or dominant society or culture. ADB\u2019s \nindigenous peoples policy uses the following characteristics to define indigenous peoples: (i) \ndescent from population groups present in a given area; (ii) maintenance of cultural and social \nidentities separate from dominant society and culture; (iii) self-identification and identification by \nothers  as  being  part  of  distinct  cultural  group;  (iv)  linguistic  identity  different  from  that  of \ndominant society; (v) social, cultural, economic and political traditions and institutions distinct \nfrom dominant culture; (vi) economic systems more oriented towards traditional productions \nsystems rather than mainstream; and (vii) unique ties and attachments to traditional habitats \nand ancestral territories. Essentially, indigenous peoples have a social and cultural identity \ndistinct  from  the  main  society,  which  makes  them  vulnerable  to  being  overlooked  in \ndevelopment processes.  \n \n3.  The coastal Vedda\u2019s communities retain a number of social and cultural traditions and \ndistinct economic activities such as group hunting, food gathering and fishing. As such, the \nVeddas are, according to ADB\u2019s policy, considered indigenous peoples.  \n \n \n ", "112  Appendix 15   \nC.  Objective of Indigenous Peoples Development Framework  \n \n4.  The  objective  of  IPDF  is  to  ensure  that  indigenous  peoples  living  in  coastal \ncommunities\u2014in this case, the Veddas\u2014will have opportunities to participate in and benefit \nequally from either project, thereby enabling them to reconstruct and improve their livelihoods, \ndwellings, and public facilities.  \n \n5.  The objectives of the IPDF are the following: \n \n(i)  Promote  active  participation  of  indigenous  peoples  in  project  planning, \nimplementation, and monitoring. \n(ii)  Formulate specific activities to improve social and economic conditions of these \ngroups, taking into account their own views in the process. \n(iii)  Ensure  that  project  interventions  are  culturally  sensitive  and  do  not  in  any \nmanner adversely affect their cultural identities and customs. \n(iv)  Promote  the  participation  of  women  in  decision  making  and  project \nimplementation.  \n \n6.  The above will provide the basis for the formulation of IPDPs of subprojects, if required.  \n \nD.  Procedure for Preparing an IPDP \n \n7.  An IPDP is an integral part of the project design and includes provisions for project \nimplementation, monitoring, and evaluation. An IPDP will consist of (i) preliminary screening, (ii) \nsocial impact assessment, (iii) mitigation measures, (iv) development assistance, and (v) project \nmonitoring. \n \n8.  Preliminary  Screening.  The  executing  agency  (EA)  and  project  design  and \nimplementation  consultants  will  visit  all  tsunami-affected  coastal  communities,  which  come \nunder these two projects. During these visits, the EA and project design and implementation \nconsultants will arrange public meetings with village leaders of Vedda communities to collect \ninformation about their views on project activities and how they address their needs.  \n \n9.  Social Impact Assessment. The screening process will identify indigenous peoples, \ntheir groups, community-based organizations, cultural traditions, and community structures. If \nrequired,  a  social  impact  assessment  (SIA)  will  be  prepared  to  gather  information  on  the \npopulation and its social, cultural, and economic conditions, and the anticipated social, cultural, \nand economic impacts of the projects, both positive and negative. Focus group meetings will be \nheld with community leaders and groups of men and women who have been severely affected \nand with those who live in the \u201czones of influence\u201d of the proposed subprojects. If the SIA \nindicates that the subprojects would significantly threaten cultural practices and sources of \nlivelihood of indigenous peoples, every attempt will be made to avoid or minimize such adverse \nimpacts in the formulation and implementation of IPDPs. \n \n10.  Mitigation Measures. All affected Vedda households will be helped to improve their \nliving standards without exposing their communities to disintegration. As vulnerable groups, they \nare entitled to receive special assistance not only to restore and improve their income and \nlivelihood, but also to maintain their distinct cultural identity. If the subproject impacts are not \nsignificant and if they could be addressed by resettlement plans that will be prepared according \nto the agreed-on resettlement framework, \u201cspecific actions\u201d could be built into resettlement ", "Appendix 15  113\nplans to safeguard their entitlements. This decision will depend on the severity of impacts on \nthem.  \n \n11.  Development Assistance. In case a subproject impacts on Veddas, they are entitled to \nall assistance that will be provided to other tsunami-affected communities. They are entitled to \nreceive  support  to  continue  their  distinct  living  arrangements  and  to  maintain  their  unique \ncultural system.  \n \n12.  Land Acquisition. In case of land acquisition, Veddas are entitled to receive land in \ncompensation for the acquired land. As indigenous peoples, they will have traditional land \nrights. The absence of land titles will not bar indigenous peoples from receiving compensation. If \nthey prefer cash for land, they are entitled to receive cash compensation for land and housing. \nTheir compensation entitlements will be the same that are listed in the approved resettlement \nframework in Appendix 12. Land-for-land or cash-for-land compensation will be paid before any \nsubproject activity is started.  \n \nE.  Consultation and Information Disclosure \n \n13.  The tsunami-affected indigenous peoples will be informed and consulted when an IPDP \nis prepared to enable them to benefit from the project and to protect them from any potential \nadverse impacts of the project. Therefore, consultation with and participation of the communities \nand their continuous interaction with local government officials will be an integral part of the \nformulation of an IPDP. The plan will be translated into the local language and made available \nbefore implementation by the EA with the assistance of NGOs. \n \n14.  Local  communities  and  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  will  help  implement \nIPDPs, and all issues in dispute will be resolved through consultation and facilitation. The EA \nwill ensure that adequate funds wil be available for consultation and facilitation \n \nF.  Institutional Framework  \n \n15.  The EA and implementing agencies (IAs) of subprojects will be responsible for the \noverall  coordination,  financing,  implementation,  and  monitoring  IPDPs.  The  EA  will  make \narrangements  to  appoint  officials  who  are  sensitive  to  indigenous  peoples  issues  and \nknowledgeable in their ways of life, culture, and practices to plan and implement IPDPs. The EA \nwill ensure that the consultants hired to plan and implement IPDPs are familiar with ADB\u2019s \nindigenous peoples policy and safeguards. The EA or IA will engage an anthropologist to \nexamine the Veddas\u2019 needs and to recommend how to accommodate such needs under the \nprojects. \n \nG.  Budgetary Provisions  \n \n16.  The EA of a subproject will provide sufficient resources to formulate an IPDP if the \nsubproject will have any impact on the Veddas. It will implement the IPDP through district, \ndivisional and local agencies and with the assistance with NGOs. A detailed budget will be \nprepared by the EA by taking into account all the activities associated with the formulation and \nimplementation of IPDPs. Each IPDP will have its own budget. Such budgets will be an integral \npart of the project cost, and will be made available during implementation. \n \n \n ", "114  Appendix 15   \nH.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n17.  A set of monitoring indicators will be included in each IPDP, to be reviewed during \nproject implementation. Internal monitoring will be done by the PMU, along with preparation of \nsemiannual progress reports. An external independent monitor will monitor the progress of the \nimplementation of IPDPs. Reporting and monitoring formats will be prepared for an effective \ninternal and external monitoring. These reports will be submitted to Resident Mission for review \nand comments.  \n \n18.  Each IPDP will be submitted by the EA to the Resident Mission for review and approval \nbefore  any  subproject  activity  is  started.  This  particularly  applies  to  land  acquisition  and \ncompensation payments.  \n ", "Appendix 16  115\n \nCONSULTANT OUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE \n \nA.

The financial management capacity at each PMU will be strengthened by \nadditional staffing resources as detailed below. These staff will be funded by the project. Each \nexecuting agency (EA) will establish a separate imprest account at the Central Bank for their \ncomponent. The imprest accounts, second-generation imprest accounts (SGIAs) and where \nagreed,  third-generation  imprest  accounts  (TGIAs)  of  each  component  will  be  established, \nmanaged, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, \nJanuary 2001, as amended from time to time, and detailed arrangements as agreed between \nthe Government and ADB.  \n \n2.  SGIAs and TGIAs are considered a necessity, as implementation of generally be at the \nprovincial  and  district  levels.  Each  TGIA  will  be  established  only  upon  establishment  of \nsatisfactory accounting capacity at the DPMUs and upon specific approval provided by ADB. \nThe SGIAs and TGIAs will be established in commercial banks acceptable to the Government \nand  ADB.  Each  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  accounts,  including  monthly \nreconciliation of the accounts and monitoring of TGIAs at the DPMUs and for the preparation of \nwithdrawal applications for replenishment of the imprest accounts.  \n \n3.

Loss of \nlife, livelihoods, incomes, and property have resulted in significant socioeconomic and psychological stress. In the \nconflict-affected areas essential investments have not been made for a long time.  \n \nThe project will provide shelter and reestablish vital services such as roads, fisheries and irrigation infrastructure, \nhealth and educational facilities, water supply, agricultural support services and institutions to revive economic \nactivities leading to employment, income generation, rehabilitation of displaced persons, and restoration of social \nstability in these areas.  \n \nImprovement  of  services  and  infrastructure  will  also  encourage  people  to  return  to  their  original  villages  and \nsettlements. With this end in view, the project will also strengthen health and educational facilities while strengthening \nlocal level institutions. Community based organizations will be established and supported, saving will be encouraged, \nwomen will be made more self-reliant, microcredit will be introduced, and recreational facilities will be provided.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Poverty Intervention \nIn the North and East, the people affected by the conflict are especially vulnerable due to gender, age, disability, and \ngeneral breakdown in their traditional livelihood systems. Internally displaced people who wish to return to their areas \nof origin need support in reestablishing their homes and their livelihoods. Essential services such as schools, \nhospitals, clinics, water and power supply are lacking in these areas. Agricultural production has been adversely \naffected by the neglect of minor irrigation schemes. Surplus food production areas have become food deficit areas. \nLivestock numbers have declined. In general the region has suffered extensive dislocation and economic progress has \nbeen hampered. These problems have been further aggravated by the tsunami through loss of lives and property. \nLivelihoods especially of fishermen have been destroyed. The psychological trauma from the loss of lives has been \ntremendous.  \n \nThe people in the project areas face major challenges in terms of basic human needs: shelter, employment and \nlivelihoods, access to services (education, health, agricultural support services, irrigation, markets, power supply), \ncommunity based institutions.  \n \n \n \nC.

Subproject \nformulation, design, and selection will be through community consultation. Local participation in the implementation of \nsubprojects  will  be  encouraged  as  appropriate.  This  process  has  proven  highly  successful  in  other  ongoing \nrehabilitation projects in the North East.  \n ", "128  Appendix 18 \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: The conflict and the tsunami have resulted in a disproportionate increase \nin the number of women-headed households in the North East. To some extent this is also true in the South after the \ntsunami. This presents significant challenges in these communities where women traditionally have many other \ndisadvantages. Both projects provide opportunities through various components, for both women and men, to restart \nand to initiate livelihood and enterprise activities. The projects will be proactive in identifying the women, households \nheaded by women, war widows, etc. in the various communities who require training in production-related skills, \nbusiness planning, marketing skills and access to credit and technical support to enable them to improve their \neconomic strength and contribute to the enhanced well-being of their families.

The objectives of the gender action plan (GAP) are to promote and enable the equal \nparticipation of men and women stakeholders as agents and beneficiaries of the Tsunami-\naffected Areas Rebuilding Project (TAARP) and the North East Community Restoration and \nDevelopment Project II (NECORD-II). The GAP is based on the analysis1 that that women are \ndisadvantaged and discriminated against in sociocultural, economic, and political spheres of life \nand are denied equal access to resources, services, and opportunities that would enable them \nto participate in, contribute to, and benefit fully from development  processes. TAARP and \nNECORD-II will encourage and support women\u2019s increased participation in needs assessment \nand consultation and in planning and implementing activities in different sectors through the \nvarious components of both projects. The GAP will give particular attention to the following: \n \n(i)  equal  participation  of  women  and  men  in  urban  planning  and  village \nreconstruction and development activities and processes;  \n(ii)  recovery of livelihood and economic activities for women and men, while paying \nspecial attention to the introduction of and support for livelihood and enterprise \nactivities for war widows and female-headed households in the conflict-affected \nareas;  \n(iii)  equal  access  of  women  and  men  to  infrastructure  activities  in  relation  to \nplanning, construction, as users and in maintenance; and  \n(iv)  involvement  of  women  and  men  in  environmental  management  and  coastal \nresource management.  \n \n2.
