INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Asia and Pacific region is subject to all major types of natural hazards. Direct \nphysical  losses  are  increasing  more rapidly  than  regional gross  domestic  product  as  both \nexposure and vulnerability to natural hazards continue to grow. There is a strong need for \nassistance to strengthen disaster resilience and support timely post-disaster response, recovery, \nand reconstruction efforts in Asia and the Pacific. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) Midterm \nReview  of  Strategy  2020  indicates  that  ADB  will  continue  to  mainstream  disaster  risk \nmanagement (DRM) and provide early and medium-term disaster response in partnership with \nspecialized aid agencies.1 \n \n2.  Recently,  space-based  technology  (SBT) 2  and  information  and  communication \ntechnology (ICT)3 applications for DRM have spread dramatically. These technologies provide \neffective tools to strengthen disaster resilience. However, ADB\u2019s developing member countries \n(DMCs) still find accessing these technologies difficult without external technical advice. \n \n3.  Through this technical assistance (TA), ADB, with the technical support of the Japan \nAerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)4 and Sentinel Asia,5 will support Armenia, Bangladesh, \nFiji, and the Philippines in enhancing the use of SBT and ICT applications in their DRM-related \ninterventions.  Extensive  discussions  were  held  with  prospective  pilot  countries  and  other \norganizations and initiatives such as JAXA, Sentinel Asia, the United Nations Development \nProgramme, and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The TA received concept clearance from \nADB Management in October 2014.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  The collection, visualization, and sharing of information on disasters and disaster risk \nprovide  a  basis  for  strengthening  disaster  resilience  and  supporting  timely  post-disaster \nresponse, recovery, and reconstruction efforts. For example, base maps (identifying the location \nof key infrastructure, and critical assets), hazard risk maps, and evacuation maps are necessary \nfor planning interventions related to disaster risk reduction, including activities related to disaster \npreparedness. Similarly, information from post-disaster damage assessment is important for \nguiding activities in response, recovery, and rehabilitation phases, such as rescuing affected \ncommunities, providing relief, and developing required recovery and reconstruction plans. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n2  SBT refers to technologies relying on space infrastructure, including satellite remote sensing, satellite navigation \nsuch as the global positioning system (GPS), and satellite communication and broadcasting systems. \n3  ICT refers to technologies that provide access to information through telecommunications such as the internet, \nwireless network, and cell phones. \n4  In July 2010, ADB and JAXA signed a letter of intent to promote activities, including disaster management in Asia \nand the Pacific by using SBT. ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance for Applying Remote Sensing Technology in River \nBasin Management. Manila (TA 8074-REG) has been conducted to support Bangladesh, the Philippines, and Viet \nNam to apply SBT and ICT in flood management. \n5  Sentinel Asia is an international cooperation network of space agencies and disaster management agencies in \nAsia and the Pacific that shares free satellite imagery and data analysis when disasters occur. It is an initiative of \nthe Asia\u2013Pacific Regional Space Agency Forum, and JAXA takes the lead and acts as a secretariat. ADB became \na member of Sentinel Asia as the data analysis node in January 2012. It used satellite data from Sentinel Asia and \nthe International Charter on Major Disasters for the damage assessment for Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines in \nNovember 2013. \n6  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 October 2014. \n ", "2   \n5.  Many DMCs, through development projects, have tried to introduce disaster monitoring \nand early warning systems using conventional sensor networks for data collection, such as \nwater-level gauges to understand flood extent, and geographic information systems (GISs) for \ndata  management  and  sharing  as  a  pilot  demonstration.  However,  DMCs  face  financial \ndifficulties in scaling up because the conventional data collection network requires a lot of \nhardware to be installed at considerable cost. The GIS capacity developed as part of these pilot \ninterventions has not been fully utilized because systems installed during such projects have not \nbeen  maintained  properly  after  the  projects  because  of  difficulties  in  collecting  updated \ninformation. The lack of reliable and updated information can lead to inappropriate plans and \npolicies and, consequently, unfavorable outcomes. Additional funding is required to overcome \nthe challenges in collecting and sharing information in a cost-effective manner. \n \n6.  Recently, the use of SBT and ICT for more efficient and cost-effective data collection \nand management have spread dramatically based on rapid technology advancements, which \nhave made them affordable and accessible, thereby increasing potential applications for DRM. \n \n7.  Crisis mapping using ICT tools equipped with global positioning system (GPS), such as \nsmartphones, has been increasingly used to provide information during disaster responses. 7 \nWhere sensor networks for disaster warning and response are not available, crowdsourcing \ninformation collection, such as through geo-tagged reports and photos, can be effective for \nsituation assessment regarding impending disasters and during events.8 People armed with ICT \ntools can be used as mobile human sensors providing immediate eyewitness reports. The \napproach has also been utilized to collect information necessary for disaster risk reduction, such \nas potential inundation area based on experiences of local people, and post-disaster response \nsuch as location of shelters and evacuation routes. \n \n8.  OpenStreetMap (OSM), a method of community-based mapping using satellite imagery \nand ICT tools, has been used to develop base maps necessary for planning and prioritizing \nDRM-related interventions.9 ICT tools such as mobile phone applications have been developed \nto support this mapping approach. OSM provides simple access to its entire database under \nopen license, which is useful for community-based mapping and data sharing in the event of a \ndisaster, as well as in humanitarian and international development work. Since OSM relies on \nthe local community to develop and update detailed base maps, it has become an effective \nmechanism to strengthen community-based DRM. \n \n9.  Satellite-based damage assessment has been used in post-disaster situations to collect \nrapid and objective damage information cost-effectively. By combining satellite-based damage \nmaps with baseline OSM data, quick and remote identification of disaster locations and the \nextent of damage, such as the number of damaged buildings categorized by type can be \nobtained for early emergency response planning of humanitarian rescue, delivery of goods, and \neffective budget mobilization. International cooperation mechanisms to share satellite imagery \nand analyze maps for free in the event of disasters have already been established, with many \nDMCs as members of the community. The International Charter for Space and Major Disasters \nand  Sentinel  Asia  have  provided  opportunities  for  DMCs  to  access  free  satellite-based \n                                                \n7  Crisis mapping is the method of information collection that utilizes data received from volunteers after disasters. \nOne of the first major events to utilize crisis mapping was the 2010 Haiti earthquake. \n8  Crowdsourcing is the process of obtaining needed information by soliciting contributions from a large group of \npeople, and especially from an online community or local volunteers, rather than from traditional employees. \n9  OSM is a project to create and distribute free geographic data and maps developed by volunteer contributors. Their \ndata is accessible at the website (http://www.openstreetmap.org). \n ", "  3 \ninformation for post-disaster activities.10 However, these data have been underutilized at the \nlocal level because of issues such as lack of awareness on the availability of such data, \ndifficulties in data access with no internet connection after a disaster, and lack of coordination \namong government agencies to share baseline GIS data necessary for effective analysis. \n \n10.  Assistance is needed to improve DMC capacity to collect and share reliable and timely \ndisaster-related data using SBT and ICT at the local government and community levels to \nstrengthen their disaster resilience and support timely post-disaster response, recovery, and \nreconstruction efforts in a more cost-effective manner.11 These new approaches will provide \ncost-effective ways for DMCs that suffer from low institutional capacity to collect and share \ninformation on disasters and disaster risk.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact will be more information-based DRM. The outcome will be improved quality \nand timeliness of information for disaster preparedness and response using SBT and ICT in the \npilot countries.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  Activities will be organized under three outputs to achieve the outcome. \n \n13.  Output  1:  Enhanced  disaster-related  information  collection,  sharing,  and \nutilization  applying  space-based  technology  and  information  and  communication \ntechnology in the selected communities. The TA will support Armenia, Bangladesh, Fiji, and \nthe Philippines by strengthening the use of SBT and ICT applications for DRM, especially for \ninformation collection, sharing, and utilization for disaster risk reduction, post-disaster response, \nrecovery, and reconstruction. Relevant agencies will be assisted with advisory services and \nfinancial  support  in  introducing  and  implementing  (i)  community-based  OSM  base  map \ndevelopment in the pilot city; (ii) ICT applications in developing community-based hazard risk \nmapping, evacuation mapping, and crisis mapping in the pilot communities; (iii) satellite-based \ndamage information at the local government and community levels using ICT tools; and (iv) \ndisaster-related  information  management  using  ICT  tools  in  the  pilot  local  government. \nDiscussions will be held with DMC agencies and development partners involved in supporting \nactions  on  disaster  information  systems  to  ensure  links  with  related  ongoing  activities. \nMethodologies, tools, and mechanisms will be documented and enhanced in preparation for the \npotential scaling up after the TA implementation. \n \n14.  The TA will strengthen capacities of target agencies, relevant agencies, stakeholders, \nand local communities in Armenia, Bangladesh, Fiji, and the Philippines for applying SBT and \nICT to DRM in a sustainable manner by optimizing existing human and technical resources and \ncountry experience. One or two pilot cities will be selected in each pilot country. One community \nin each pilot city will be selected as the pilot community. Expected training programs are hands-\non training and training workshops for (i) the use of SBT and ICT in community-based DRM, \n                                                \n10 The International Charter on Space and Major Disasters provides charitable satellite data to relief organizations in \nthe event of major disasters. \n11 ADB. 2014. Operational Plan for Integrated Disaster Risk Management, 2014\u20132020. Manila. This plan highlights \nthat ADB will promote the application of state-of-the-art space-based and ICT such as remote sensing and GIS \nboth for disaster risk assessment and early warning systems. \n ", "4   \nespecially for community-based mapping and information collection; and (ii) the application of \nSBT and ICT in DRM, especially for data collection and management at the local government \nlevel. The TA will also conduct training of trainers for sustainable capacity development and \nevacuation  drills  to  demonstrate  introduced  applications  and  operational  procedures.  The \nevacuation  drills  will  be  conducted  in  each  pilot  community  to  demonstrate  the  new \nmethodologies  of  data  collection  and  coordination  among  relevant  agencies.  The  specific \nactivities will be identified through further information collection and consultation sessions with \ntarget and relevant agencies. \n \n15.  Output 2: Expanded knowledge on space-based technology and information and \ncommunication  technology  applications  for  disaster  risk  management  in  each  pilot \ncountry and the region. The TA will support dissemination of knowledge and practices on SBT \nand ICT applications for DRM in each pilot country as well as other DMCs and development \npartners in the region. The TA will strengthen their capacities through videoconferences and \nregional workshops, in collaboration with JAXA and other space agencies as well as existing \ninternational frameworks for SBT and ICT applications for DRM such as Sentinel Asia. \n \n16.  Output  3:  Policy  guidelines  developed  regarding  sustainable  space-based \ntechnology and information and communication technology applications for disaster risk \nmanagement  in  each  pilot  country.  The  TA  will  support  a  needs  survey,  cost\u2013benefit \nanalyses, and a study of best-practice SBT and ICT applications for DRM in DMCs to organize \nrelated information and develop policy guidelines in each pilot country. The policy guidelines will \nbe  introduced  to  decision  makers through  workshops  to  promote  understanding  about the \nimportance and cost-effectiveness of the newly introduced methodologies. The aim is to secure \nenough support to operate them in a sustainable manner after project completion and expand \nthem to wider areas. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,033,400, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. JAXA will make a \n$33,400 equivalent in-kind contribution for counterpart personnel costs, technical fees, and \nadministration services. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB, through the  Sector Advisory Service Division of its Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment Department, will be the executing agency. The division will collaborate with ADB's \nurban sector group, regional departments, and resident missions concerned. Team members \nfrom regional departments will coordinate implementation of in-country TA activities. JAXA will \nbe ADB\u2019s project technical adviser. In accordance with the partnership agreement between ADB \nand  JAXA  for  their  collaboration  under  the  TA,  JAXA  will  provide  in-kind  services  for  (i) \nimplementing capacity development for applying SBT, and (ii) technical inputs in applying SBT \nto DRM. The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from April 2015 to March 2017. \n \n19.  Armenia, Bangladesh, Fiji, and the Philippines are selected as pilot countries of the TA \nbecause (i) among the DMCs, they are highly prone to disasters; (ii) they have identified \nstrengthening  disaster  resilience  in  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategies  and/or  country \noperations  business  plans;  (iii)  they  have  strong  commitment  to  developing  nonstructural \nmeasures  to  manage  disaster  risk  and  to  strengthen  local  capacities  for  effective \nimplementation of DRM-related interventions; and (iv) they have potential complementarity with \n ", "  5 \nthe ongoing nationwide implementation of community-driven development or urban disaster \nmanagement programs.12 \n \n20.  Implementing agencies will include the Ministry of Emergency Situation in Armenia, the \nDepartment of Disaster Management with the support of the Local Government Engineering \nDepartment  in  Bangladesh,  the  National  Disaster  Management  Office  in  Fiji,  and  the \nDepartment of Social Welfare and Development in the Philippines. The implementing agencies \nin the pilot countries will assign TA project directors from among senior staff to supervise and \ncoordinate TA in-country activities and to participate in the regional workshops. Coordination \nwith related agencies, including space agencies, DRM agencies, stakeholders, ADB, JAXA, and \nconsultants, will be essential to ensure synergy of activities and value addition to outcomes \nthrough regular joint meetings organized by the implementing agencies. \n \n21.  The  TA  will  require  144  person-months  of  consulting  services  (32  person-months \ninternational and 112 person-months national) to implement the TA components in the pilot \ncountries. All consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). For the selection of the main consulting \nfirm,  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  (90:10)  method  will  be  used  because  of  the \nrequirement for a highly qualified level of technique, knowledge, and experience to achieve \nexpected outputs. For the selection of two international consulting firms for ICT and remote \nsensing, consultants\u2019 qualifications selection will be used.13 The consultants will work under the \noverall supervision of ADB. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n22.  Any  procurement  under  this  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement \nGuidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). The shopping method will be used to procure \nequipment.14 Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). At the end of the TA, \nequipment purchased through the shopping method  under the TA will be assigned to the \nagencies concerned in the DMCs. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n23.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Applying Space-Based Technology and Information and \nCommunication Technology to Strengthen Disaster Resilience. \n                                                \n12 For example, ADB. 2013.
