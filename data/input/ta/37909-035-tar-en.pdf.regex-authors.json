Trade finance is explicitly recognized in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for \nDevelopment as important to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals \n(SDGs).1 However, an ADB survey published in September 2019 estimated a global trade finance \ngap of $1.5 trillion, with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and women-led businesses \nbeing the most underserved.2 This gap has widened during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic. The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) anticipates that an additional $1.9 \ntrillion\u2013$5 trillion is required to support a rapid global recovery.3 \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program (TFP) reduces market gaps for trade finance by (i) \nproviding guarantees and loans to banks, and undertaking funded and unfunded risk participation, \nin support of trade; and (ii) delivering knowledge products, services and solutions. The TFP\u2019s \nimpact would be to strengthen the capacity of domestic financial institutions to encourage and \nexpand access to banking, insurance, and financial services for all. This will be achieved by \nincreasing access of DMC banks to trade finance through the program. The outcome of the \nprogram would be expansion of support for trade finance in Asia and the Pacific, while outputs \ninclude (i) capacity to provide trade finance by the program\u2019s partner banks enhanced in a gender-\ninclusive manner, (ii) the expanded provision of trade finance sustained, (iii) gender inclusiveness \nof participating banks\u2019 human resource policies enhanced, (iv) zccess to international trade \nfinance of women-owned businesses enhanced, and (v) environmental and social safeguards \nawareness for both the TFP and its partner banks increased. \n \n3.  TFP\u2019s current program limit is $2.15 billion. Since its launch in 2003, TFP has supported \nover $48 billion in trade and mobilized $28 billion in co-financing. In 2020, the number of \ntransactions supported by TFP increased by 49%, to 7,178 from 4,832 in 2019. The value of \ntransactions grew by 7%, to $5.8 billion from $5.4 billion in 2019. TFP is ADB\u2019s largest business \nand generator of co-financing, contributing $3 billion in co-financing in 2020. The TFP conducts \napproximately 100 due diligence and annual reviews per year, enabling it to provide guarantees \nand loans through partner banks. This closes market gaps for trade finance and supports more \ntrade, leading to economic growth and job creation. Information from due diligence and annual \nreviews  enables  TFP  to  share  knowledge  that  helps  attract  co-financing  and  international \ninvestment in developing member countries (DMCs), thereby closing trade finance market gaps.  \n \n4.  The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 continues to pose an immense \nchallenge for global trade and the economic growth of many DMCs. It underscores the need to \nsupport trade not only to move medical supplies but also to bolster economies. The TFP is an \nexcellent crisis response vehicle, with an extensive global network of 200 partner financial \ninstitutions through which support can be channeled quickly and efficiently, including to small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are the entities most likely impacted by the pandemic.  \nTFP is central to ADB\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.4 Of the 7,178 transactions \nsupported under TFP, 5,467 were COVID-related transactions worth $4.5 billion for the purchase \nof goods such as test kits and medical equipment. These supported (i) companies that provide \nessential services and (ii) financial intermediaries that provide direct financing to individual \n \n1  United Nations. 2015.

TFP also encourages commercial sustainability by helping accelerate progress in gender \nequality, promoting sustainability in trade, and ensuring integrity and transparency. In addition, \nTFP produced targeted knowledge products such as the COVID-19 supply chain tool,5 webinars \nabout managing COVID-19 trade finance risk and digitization, webinars on other issues and online \ntraining. In 2020, TFP conducted 10 webinars with over 1,200 participants.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \nA.  Overall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n6.  The technical assistance cluster was approved by the Board on 11 April 2018 and \ncomplements ADB's non-sovereign operations in trade and trade facilitation projects.6 It is linked \nto ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Private Sector Operations, 2019\u20132024, as well numerous strategies \nand business opportunities presented in country strategy papers, regional cooperation strategies \nand programs, and country operations business plans for ADB's DMCs.7 The technical assistance \ncluster builds on ongoing work under TA projects started in 2009, 2013, 2014, and 2015.8 \n \n7.  Subproject 1 (TA 9532), subproject 2 (TA 9774) and subproject 3 (TA 6547) funded TFP\u2019s \ndue diligence activities on partner banks from May 2018 to present. To date, 42 new issuing bank \nassessments, 15 preliminary analyses of potential TFP issuing bank candidates, 281 bank \nmonitoring assessments, 47 banking system analyses, 40 new/annual reviews of partner financial \ninstitutions (PFIs), 10 new/annual reviews of existing risk distribution partners and 6 training \nsessions/workshops have been delivered. Subproject 1 was completed last 5 July 2020 while \nsubprojects  2  and  3  have  been  extended  until  31  December  2021  and  31  March  2023, \nrespectively, to align the duration of the subprojects with the engagement period of consultants \nand to allow TFP to use the remaining budget for upcoming training and events.  \n \nB.  Subproject Scope  \n8.  Similar to the subprojects 1-3, subproject 4 will provide the TFP with funding to conduct \ndue diligence on partner banks and financial institutions. Financial analysts will be engaged \nthrough a firm from 2021 to 2022 to work with the TFP to conduct due diligence and ongoing \nannual reviews of participating banks and partner financial institutions. Subproject 4 will also \ninclude activities related to the program\u2019s gender, sustainability and integrity initiatives as well as \ncapacity building through seminars, including webinars and other online trainings. \n \n \n5   A new tool https://www.adb.org/multimedia/scf/ was published in May 2020 on the ADB website that maps, end-to-end the entire \nsupply chain for 33 critical pandemic-fighting goods, such as ventilators, N95 masks, etc. The tool helps banks, investors and \ngovernment ensure companies have no bottlenecks and financial support is there to ramp up supply.  \n6   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on XXX (to be filled in after approval). \n7   ADB. 2011.

Output 1: Capacity to provide trade finance and guarantees by developing member \ncountry banks enhanced. Assessments of new and existing banks and PFIs will be conducted \nunder the TA by consultants who will support TFP relationship managers (ADB international staff). \nDue diligence on banks will enable ADB to identify and characterize any gaps in the financial and \ntechnical capacity of individual banks that would inhibit the provision and/or increase of trade \nfinance credit lines.9 DMC banks are targeted based on a market survey conducted by the TFP. \nIf there is market demand for TFP guarantees on a particular DMC bank, the bank will be targeted \nfor due diligence and inclusion into the program.10 The due diligence results will be included in \ncredit applications to establish or maintain TFP credit lines for participating banks.  \n \n10.  Output  2:    Trade  finance  in-person  and/or  online  trainings,  seminars  and/or \nwebinars and other networking events conducted. Approximately 2 in-person and/or online \ntraining sessions, seminars or webinars will be conducted under Subproject 4. The TFP provides \npost-due diligence feedback to DMC banks to identify weaknesses and improvement benchmarks. \nThis capacity development will help strengthen DMC banks and improve their ability to attract \ncredit lines to support trade from international financial institutions. This will ultimately benefit \nimporters and exporters by increasing their opportunities to access trade finance, allowing them \nto expand their business operations, and thereby create jobs and reduce poverty. \n \n11.  Information regarding the adequacy of the financial and technical capacity of individual \nbanks will be confidentially conveyed to those banks. More general information about trade \nfinance operations will be disseminated through seminars, webinars and other online training to \nwhich DMC banks, exporters, government officials, and international banks may be invited. These \nare expected to cover (i) key concepts and processes in trade finance, (ii) essential elements in \ndeveloping and marketing trade finance products and services, (iii) payment and risk categories, \n(iv) risk analysis of trade finance products, (v) fundamentals of documentary credits, (vii) de-\nrisking and anti-money laundering compliance methods, and (viii) digitization of trade finance. The \nTA will also be used to fund regional seminars and other TFP training events, as well as an annual \nnetworking event, online or otherwise, which will bring together international and local DMC banks \nand seek to increase private sector engagement with DMCs. \n \n12.  Output 3: Gender and safeguards-related in-person and/or online training, seminars \nand/or webinars conducted. The aim of the gender initiative is more financial inclusion and \nsupport for individual women and women entrepreneurs. Gender initiatives will continue to be \nimplemented within the TFP and will set a minimum threshold of 40% for the percentage of female \nparticipants in all of its training. The TFP\u2019s gender initiative is in progress with human resource \npolicies of 19 partner banks in 8 DMCs reviewed to identify enhancements to attract, retain, \nand promote women in banking.11 Resource persons will be engaged to develop and come up \nwith knowledge products such as in-person and/or online training, seminars and/or webinars, and \nnetworking for DMC partner banks focused on improving the banks\u2019 customer service for female \nclientele, as well as for women-owned businesses centered on increasing their access to trade \nfinance.   \n \n13.  On the sustainability front,  the TA will build on work done under previous and ongoing \nTFP TAs to create more awareness of and help address social and environmental issues such \n \n9  The TA will coordinate with the TFP to target banks where there is market demand for capacity development. \n10  Notwithstanding current market demand, the TFP will likewise support further expansion to Group A countries including banks in \nthe Pacific region (e.g., Samoa and Vanuatu). \n11 ADB. 2018.

Output 4: Integrity due diligence and reviews completed on TFP developing member \ncountry  banks  and  partner  financial  institutions.  Following  the  global  financial  crisis, \ncompliance and regulatory requirements have increased significantly for banks, including in the \nfield of trade finance. Unintended consequences of anti-money-laundering and counter-financing \nof terrorism (AML/CFT) measures contribute to market gaps. The TA will support strengthening \nof AML/CFT practices by funding related online training and preparation for the Financial Action \nTask Force (FATF) Working Group on Trade-Based Money Laundering events in various DMCs. \nConsultants will also be engaged to strengthen integrity and anti-money laundering measures \nand monitoring by conducting sanctions screening on TFP transactions and integrity due diligence \nand reviews on all TFP DMC banks and PFIs. \n \n15.  Activities will include the following: \n(i)  work with individual banks to acquire financial data; \n(ii)  analyze the financial information through financial, ratio, gap, and other analyses; \n(iii)  conduct financial due diligence on banks; \n(iv)  assess the trade finance operations capacity of selected banks and make \nrecommendations for improvement; \n(v)  draft credit applications, risk ratings, and financial due diligence reports; \n(vi)  conduct integrity due diligence and reviews, including monitoring and following- \nup on recommendations for improvement; \n(vii)  conduct due diligence and financial assessments on TFP banks with a view to \nexpanding and leveraging the TFP to include additional ADB financial products; \n(viii)  conduct a banking sector analysis for each DMC; \n(ix)  conduct signing with new partner banks;  \n(x)  deliver trade finance in-person and/or online training, and seminars and/or \nwebinars;  \n(xi)  process and administer TFP loans and guarantees transactions, and monitor \nprogram and counterparty limits; \n(xii)  support initiatives related to knowledge-sharing and partnership development \nactivities important to closing trade finance gaps such as those related to gender, \nsustainability and AML/CFT (including in-person and/or online training, regional \nconferences, seminars and/or webinars, and networking events, which may be \ndone through online facilities); and \n(xiii)  conduct relevant sanctions screening for all TFP transactions. \n \nD.  Subproject Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $3,700,000, of which (i) $2,194,372 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-donor contribution), and (ii) $1,505,628 \nwill be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-income \ntransfer).
