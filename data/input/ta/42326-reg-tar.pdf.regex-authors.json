INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Social Protection Strategy, approved in September 2001, is a key approach of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) in the fight against poverty in Asia and the Pacific.1 This \nstrategy outlines ADB\u2019s commitment to developing priority interventions to reduce poverty and \nvulnerability  in  the  region.  A  major  element  of  the  strategy  is  social  insurance,  aimed  at \nmitigating risks associated with unemployment, ill health, disability, work-related injury, and old \nage. Recognizing the importance of social insurance for old-age income support, ADB has \nsupported several social insurance projects in the past decade to help strengthen pension \nsystems in many developing member countries, including the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, \nIndonesia, Thailand, and Viet Nam. ADB has supported the implementation of new pension \nschemes  with  broader  coverage  and  more  efficient  and  sustainable  operations.  Several \ntechnical assistance (TA) projects have also aimed to widen the coverage of pension systems to \ninclude the informal sector and low-income groups.2 In some cases, support for pension reforms \nhas been explicitly tied to strengthening financial markets, as pension funds can be important \nsources of long-term financing. Developing Asia\u2019s Pension Systems: Overview and Reform \nDirections (the TA) will build upon the experience in pension systems and reforms of various \nAsian economies. The TA will produce an organized body of knowledge to inform policy makers \nand the public on (i) where East and Southeast Asian pension systems are today, (ii) where \nthey need to go, and (iii) what they need to do to get there.3 By creating, organizing, and \ndisseminating policy-relevant knowledge of some Asian pension systems, ADB can assist its \ndeveloping member countries in learning from each others\u2019 experiences and in establishing \npension systems that promote the inclusion of a large and growing segment of the population\u2014\nthe elderly\u2014in the development process. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Indeed, the rapid aging of developing Asia\u2019s population has highlighted old-age income \nsupport.  Although  demographic  transition  toward  older  populations  is  the  most  important \nrationale for pension reform (i.e., building up pension systems capable of delivering affordable, \nadequate, and sustainable old-age income support), there are other justifications. In particular, \nthe weakening of informal, family-based old-age income support has strengthened the need for \neffective pension systems. Economic progress in Asia and the Pacific has been accompanied \nby rapid urbanization and a decline in the agricultural sector. Social and economic changes \nhave given rise to smaller nuclear families, a situation that is not favorable to providing old-age \nintrafamily support. Evolving social and cultural norms and values, accompanying economic \nprogress, are also contributing to the decline in traditional family-based old-age support.  \n \n3.  Rapid globalization and labor market developments are other reasons for strengthening \ndeveloping Asia's pension systems.5 While globalization has offered enormous opportunities in \nterms of access to foreign markets, capital, and technology, it has also led to various forms of \nstructural  dislocation  and  heightened  a  sense  of  economic  and  social  insecurity.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

In Weiss, L., ed. States in the Global Economy: Bringing \nDomestic Institutions Back In. Cambridge Studies in International Relations. 86. Cambridge: Cambridge University \nPress. \n ", "2   \nWell-functioning social protection systems, including pension systems, can ease such insecurity \nand thereby promote public support for globalization. In Asia, the loss of job security due to \nglobalization is compounded by the presence of a large informal sector. Workers in the informal \nsector are usually unprotected by labor regulations and lack access to pensions and other \nbenefits.6  Asia\u2019s  growing  labor  mobility  and  huge  informal  employment  call  for  improving \npension management and coverage. \n \n4.  Pension reform can also stimulate private investment in developing Asia by promoting \nsound and efficient financial systems. Underdeveloped financial systems are a major weakness \nin the investment climate of many countries. Indeed, financial development\u2014in particular the \ndevelopment of capital markets\u2014and the consequent improvement of the investment climate \nare crucial rationales for pension reform. By effectively mobilizing savings and catalyzing the \ngrowth  of  large  institutional  investors  to  manage  the  growing  pool  of  pension  assets,  \nwell-functioning pension systems contribute to the development of stock and bond markets. In \nfact, several studies, including those by the World Bank, confirm the positive impact of pension \nreform on capital market development in developing countries.7 Capital market development, in \nturn, will stimulate investment in Asia and the Pacific by expanding the access of firms to \ncapital.  In  particular,  well-functioning  capital  markets  can  facilitate  the  emergence  of  new  \nstart-up firms, which play a key role in promoting a dynamic and vibrant economy. Studies by \nthe World Bank also found evidence of a positive effect of financial development arising from \npension reform on private investment.8 \n \n5.  Successful pension reform should enable pension management institutions to perform \nfive core tasks effectively: (i) reliably collect contributions, taxes, and other receipts, including \nany  loan  payments;  (ii)  pay  benefits  in  a  timely  and  correct  manner;  (iii)  secure  financial \nmanagement  and  productive  investment  of  pension  assets;  (iv)  maintain  an  effective \ncommunication  network,  including  development  of  accurate  data  and  record-keeping \nmechanisms to support collection, payment, and financial activities; and (v) produce financial \nstatements and reports that promote better governance, fiduciary responsibility, transparency, \nand accountability.  \n \n6.  In addition, a well-designed pension system should demonstrate certain basic features. \nIdeally, a pension system should be broad-based, i.e., be adequate in terms of both coverage \nand range of risks covered; be affordable from individual, business, fiscal, and macroeconomic \nperspectives; be actuarially and hence financially sound and sustainable over time; be robust to \nwithstand macroeconomic and other shocks; and provide reasonable levels of post-retirement \nincome coupled with a safety net for the elderly poor. Society needs to decide\u2014through policy \nmakers\u2014on the relative weights given to adequacy, affordability, sustainability, robustness, and \nthe  level  of  safety  nets,  as  there  may  be  trade-offs  among  these  features.  For  example, \ndecreasing benefits helps restore a pension system\u2019s long-term financial health but reduces the \nadequacy  of  pension  income.  Likewise,  raising  contributions  promotes  sustainability  at  the \n                                                 \n6  For an extended discussion of informal workers in Asia, see Felipe, J. and R.

Societies must make complex choices regarding such tradeoffs, and \nthis explains why pension reform is a politically difficult process. \n \n7.  A major strategic choice confronting developing Asian countries in the context of pension \nsystem design is the choice between individual risk bearing and social risk pooling. Under \nindividual risk bearing, an individual bears all the risks, without sharing any risks with others. A \ngood example is defined contribution pension plans, which make the individual responsible for \nhis or her own investment and longevity risks. In contrast, under social risk pooling, society \npools together the risks of all individual members and bears the risks on their behalf. In the real \nworld, pension systems typically incorporate elements of both individual risk bearing and social \nrisk pooling but differ with respect to the relative importance of each. In fact, the World Bank\u2019s \nmultipillar model recommends combining five different pillars of old-age income support with \nvarying degrees of social risk pooling: (i) pay-as-you-go, defined benefit pension schemes; (ii) \nmandatory  defined  contribution;  (iii)  privately  managed,  voluntary  savings;  (iv)  zero  pillar, \nproviding minimum level of protection; and (v) family support.9 The multipillar model has greatly \ninfluenced the current thinking on pension design and reform among policy makers around the \nworld. This has led to a consensus that effective old-age income support requires a healthy mix \nof individual risk bearing and social risk pooling. However, the real challenge for each country is \nto develop a multipillar system that best suits its own needs, preferences, and capabilities. \n \n8.  Identifying the directions for pension reform in Asia requires an understanding of the \ncurrent  shortcomings  of  its  pension  systems.  A  cursory  survey  of  Asian  pension  systems \nindicates that there is considerable heterogeneity in terms of key pension parameters such as \npension age and contribution rate. Pension reform requires a diagnosis of the main weaknesses \nof the pension systems. Those weaknesses impede the ability of pension systems to fulfill their \nbasic objectives such as enabling consumption smoothing and relieving poverty. A careful \ndiagnosis is essential to identify what main areas of pension systems need to be strengthened \nand to lay the groundwork for pension reform.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  TA  will  promote  improved  understanding  of  the  pension  systems  of  East  and \nSoutheast Asian countries\u2014the People's Republic of China, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, \nMalaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam\u2014their main structural features, their \nmain weaknesses, and strategic directions for reform. Asian policy makers and the public will \nhave a better understanding of the current state of their national pension systems, and hence \nhow  to  improve  and  strengthen  them  to  contribute  to  social  inclusion  and  economic \ndevelopment. The TA will also perform an advocacy role of making policy makers and the public \nmore aware of the urgency of pension reform. The TA will facilitate and accelerate dialogue and \nsharing of knowledge among regional pension authorities. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  A comprehensive, in-depth, policy-relevant, and high-quality book about Asian pension \nsystems and pension reform will be published under the TA. The TA will focus on East and \n                                                 \n9  Holzman, R and R. Hinz. 2005.

Washington, DC. \n ", "4   \nSoutheast Asia, as economies in these subregions face the fastest demographic aging. The \nbook will cover the following. \n(i)  Overview of pension systems of East and Southeast Asian countries. This \nsection  will  discuss  common,  regionwide  challenges  and  opportunities  to \nhighlight  the  importance  of  undertaking  reforms  in  pension  systems.  Such \nchallenges include demographic transition, weakening of informal systems of \nsocial support, and globalization. \n(ii)  Country studies of national pension systems. This section will discuss the \nlatest  developments  related  to  pension  reforms  and  policy  issues  in  each \ncountry. To facilitate intercountry comparisons, the country studies will follow a \nstandard format\u2014e.g., overview, weaknesses, and reform directions. The studies \nwill also explore the potential impact of pension reform on investment through its \nimpact on financial development. \n(iii)  Pension modeling study. This section will provide quantitative estimates of the \nreplacement rate\u2014i.e., ratio of retirement income to pre-retirement income\u2014and \nother performance indicators of pension systems.  \n(iv)  Central messages and reform directions for the region. This section will \nhighlight the most salient lessons\u2014both positive and negative\u2014for the rest of the \nregion. More importantly, it will draw out some specific and concrete directions \nfor reform based on the analysis of the preceding chapters. It will make realistic \nsuggestions on what each country should do to strengthen its pension system. \nSuggestions  can  be  country-specific  to  take  into  account  the  particular \ncircumstances of each country, and regionwide to take into account common \nissues. \n \n11.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  in  collaboration  with  the  Organisation  for  Economic  \nCo-operation and Development (OECD), which has expressed support for a joint activity with \nADB on Asian pension reform.10 ADB will be responsible for coordinating the country studies \nand the overall research program, while OECD will be responsible for the pension modeling \nstudy.  OECD has developed \u201cPensions at a Glance\u201d analyses, which can be used to compare \nexpected future pension entitlements and further developed by collecting additional information \non other aspects of pension systems. It is envisaged that a common framework of analysis will \nbe  used  to  compare  pension  systems  currently  in  place  in  selected  Asian  countries.  An \ninception workshop will be held to arrive at a common framework of analysis. \n \n12.  A regional research workshop on Asian pension systems and pension reform will also be \norganized to discuss findings from the country studies and pension modeling. Authorities from \npension  policy-making  institutions  and  other  experts  on  pension  systems  will  be  asked  to \nparticipate in the workshop.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $400,000 and will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2014other sources). The detailed cost breakdown and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n10 Preliminary discussions with OECD were made by Donghyun Park on 25\u201326 June 2008 at the International \nConference on Pension Reform in Asia, organized by the OECD/Korea Policy Centre and the World Bank. Mark \nPearson, the Social Policy Division head at OECD, issued an official memo indicating support for an ADB\u2013OECD \ncooperation on Asian pension reform.  \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will be the Executing Agency, responsible for implementing and monitoring the TA. \nIn particular, the Macroeconomics and Finance Research Division will implement the TA in \ncollaboration with departments concerned. Since the TA will be implemented in partnership with \nOECD, the letter of intent between ADB and OECD will serve as the basis of their partnership.11 \n \n15.  For the country studies, eight international consultants will be engaged for a total of \napproximately  7  person-months  to  write  research  papers,  under  the  guidance  of  the  TA \nsupervising officer in the Macroeconomics and Finance Research Division. There will be an \ninception workshop where ADB, OECD, consultants, and resource persons will deliberate on a \ncommon framework of analysis. Toward the latter stage, a regional workshop will be organized \nto present the findings of the research papers. Resource persons will be hired for approximately \n1.5 person-months to review the papers, provide comments, and serve as discussants in the \nworkshop. Two national consultants will be engaged for a total of 3 person-months to assist in \npreparing the country studies and organizing the regional workshop and related activities. Once \nall the chapters of the book are completed, an international copy editor and desktop publishing \nspecialist will be hired for about 2.5 person-months to ensure a high-quality publication that \nadheres to ADB style, usage, and format. \n \n16.  All consultants will be engaged individually in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Terms of reference for consultants \nare in Appendix 3. A draft outline of the final report is in Appendix 4. Disbursements under the \nTA will be made in accordance with the ADB Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.12 \nThe TA is expected to be completed in 24 months, from September 2009 to August 2011. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis for \nDeveloping Asia\u2019s Pension Systems: Overview and Reform Directions, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n11 On 2 March 2005, ADB and OECD signed a letter of intent identifying the areas of cooperation, one of which is in \nfinancial markets, including pensions and insurance.  \n12 ADB. 2008.

The rapid aging of developing Asia\u2019s population has highlighted old-age income support. \nDemographic transition is by far the most important\u2014but not the only\u2014rationale for pension \nreform  (i.e.,  building  up  pension  systems  capable  of  delivering  affordable,  adequate,  and \nsustainable  old-age  income  support).  This  section  will  also  discuss  common  regionwide \nchallenges and opportunities to emphasize the urgency of pension reform in developing Asia. \nThis study will provide readers with an up-to-date overview and diagnosis of various Asian \npension systems, and give policy makers concrete and specific policy advice for pension reform. \n \nB.

This  section  consists  of  eight  country  chapters\u2014the  People's  Republic  of  China, \nIndonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The \nstudy concentrates on East and Southeast Asia, which are more advanced in population aging. \nEach chapter will be based on a background paper prepared by a pension specialist with expert \nknowledge of that country's pension system. The country chapters will follow a standard format, \nwhich  will  revolve  around  an  overview,  diagnosis  of  key  weaknesses,  and  \ncountry-specific policy recommendations. The country chapters will include a section that looks \nat  the  potential  impact  of  pension  reform  on  investment  through  its  impact  on  financial \ndevelopment. \n \nC.  Pension Modeling Study \n \n3.  This section will report and discuss the pension model of the Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development, and the results from simulating that model for countries in Asia \nand the Pacific. The simulations will input the parameters of each country's pension system \n(e.g., contribution rate and retirement age) as well as socioeconomic parameters (e.g., average \ngross domestic product growth rate and demographic structure) into the model to estimate \nseveral performance indicators. Of particular interest is the replacement rate, or the ratio of \npension benefits to pre-retirement income, which is widely used as a measure of adequacy of \npension as a source of post-retirement income. The simulations will be structured to maximize \nthe comparability of the estimates across countries.  \n \nD.  Central Messages and Reform Directions for the Region \n \n4.  This section will start by highlighting the central messages that emerge from the analysis \nof the preceding chapters. The countries vary widely in terms of their socioeconomic profile and \nstructure  of  their  pension  systems,  and  consequently  face  country-specific  challenges  in \npension reform. However, many regionwide challenges, such as rapid population aging and \ninadequate coverage, confront pension systems. This section will also draw out the most salient \ndirections for reform based on the main findings of the book. Finally, this section will touch upon \nwhat might be the main relevant lessons that Asian countries can learn from each other as they \nall strive to deliver affordable, adequate, and sustainable old-age income support to their rapidly \naging populations. \n \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20091006150553+08'00'", "Subject": "Research and Development Technical Assistance (RDTA) ", "Author": "ar9", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "developing asia pension systems, research development technical assistance, adb RDTA, east asian pension systems, southeast asian pension systems, adb RETA 7357, adb project 42326", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20091009101122+08'00'", "Title": "Developing Asia\u2019s Pension Systems: Overview and Reform Directions"}, "author_page": " \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  OECD  \u2013  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLASSIFICATION \n \nType  \u2013  Research and development technical assistance (RDTA) \nTargeting  \u2013  General intervention \nclassification \nSector (subsector)  \u2013  Finance (insurance and contractual savings) \nThemes (subthemes)  \u2013  Economic growth (promoting macroeconomic stability), social \ndevelopment (other vulnerable groups), capacity development \n(institutional development) \nLocation impact  \u2013  Regional (high impact), national (high impact)  \nPartnership  \u2013  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \n \nNOTE \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.  \n \nVice-President  U.
