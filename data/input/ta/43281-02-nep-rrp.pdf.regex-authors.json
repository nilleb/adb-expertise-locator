I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ngrant to Nepal for the Detailed Engineering Study for the Upper Seti Hydropower Project, and \n(ii) proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) for Preparing Hydropower Development \nfor Energy Crisis. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  For  the  past  several  years,  Nepal  has  been  experiencing  acute  power  shortages, \nparticularly in the dry winter season. During the 2008/09 winter, the country had no electricity for \n16 hours per day. In December 2008, the government declared a national energy crisis and \napproved the National Energy Crisis Fixation Program. Under this program, the government \napproved immediate, midterm, and long-term measures to deal with the worsening electricity \nsituation in the country. Subsequently, it announced that the Upper Seti Hydropower Project, one \nof three critical projects for the country, would be the \u201cproject of national pride.\u201d1  \n \n3.  The potential of Nepal's hydropower is huge; it could sustain the country's economy and \nsocial life as well as meet the demands of neighboring countries through power export. Of the \ncountry's  theoretical  hydropower  potential  of  83,000 megawatts  (MW),  43,000 MW  are \nconsidered economically viable. Currently, Nepal has a total installed generation capacity of \n689 MW  (i.e.,  only  1.6%  of  the  economically  viable  potential).  During  the  dry  winter,  this \ndecreases to 260 MW\u2014peak demand is 800 MW\u2014resulting in acute shortages. Peak demand \nhas been growing by 10% every year and the domestic power deficit has been expanding \nrapidly. In Nepal, peak demand is recorded during the winter when the country has its lowest \ngeneration capacity. About 85% of total generation capacity relies on run-of-river hydropower \nplants,  where  the  river-water  flows  for  generation  are  significantly  reduced  during  the  dry \n(winter) season. In 2008/09, hydropower plants operated at 49% capacity on average due to \nlack of water storage needed to compensate for seasonal flows. The serious power outages \ncripple economic activities, social services, and daily life in Nepal. Significant load shedding has \nresulted in a large decline in productivity and huge economic losses for the country.2    \n \n4.  The country partnership strategy 2010\u20132012 identifies Nepal\u2019s power sector as the most \nsevere infrastructure constraint on economic growth.3 In addition to power shortage, electricity \ncoverage is limited to about 56% of all households.4 To meet the country's development priority, \nin November 2009 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the Energy Access and \nEfficiency  Improvement  Project.  This  project  is  extending  transmission  and  distribution  to \nimprove energy access and efficiency in urban and rural areas.5 To supply more power to these \nnetwork systems and address fundamental issues in the energy crisis, the government intends \n                                                 \n1  The other two national projects are the Kathmandu Nijgad Fast-Track Road Project, and the Hulaki Sadak Road \nProject. \n2  Summary Sector Assessment (Appendix 2). \n3  ADB. 2009.

", "2 \nto  expand  generation  capacity,  with  urgent  emphasis  on  year-round  power  supply  using \ndomestic clean energy sources.6  \n \n5.  In 2006/07, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) conducted a feasibility \nstudy to develop the Upper Seti Hydropower Project (127 MW) with water storage to meet \ndomestic consumption demand, in particular for the dry season.7 While the feasibility study report \nassesses  the  project  to  be  viable  socially,  environmentally,  financially,  and  economically,  it \nidentified requirements for thorough geological and hydrological studies and due diligence works. \nTo  undertake  these  development  activities,  ADB  and  the  government  include  two  separate \nactivities for project preparatory support in the 2010 country program: (i) detailed engineering \nstudies, and (ii) other due diligence and preparatory works for the anticipated 2012 Upper Seti \nHydropower Project.  \n \n6.  ADB and JICA jointly financed the Kali Gandaki \u201cA\u201d Hydroelectric Project (144 MW), \nwhich was commissioned in 2002.8 While this, Nepal\u2019s largest run-of-river power plant, has \nmainly sustained the country's power requirements, the only reliable sources of hydropower \ngeneration in the dry season are the Kulekhani storage hydropower plants (92 MW in total, \nfunded by JICA), owned by the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA). Independent power producers \nhave  only  small  run-of-river  plants. 9  Continued  focus  on  exploiting  hydropower  without \naccompanying water storage infrastructure will perpetuate highly seasonal power generation \nand will not address dry season power outages. The country diagnostic studies determine that \nfocus needs concentrate on developing generation capacity that is available year-round.10  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The expected impact from the detailed engineering study (the Study) for the Upper Seti \nHydropower  Project  is  increased  generation  capacity  for  the  country  to  sustain  inclusive \neconomic growth. Additional power generation capacity of 127 MW will help alleviate the power \ncrisis, which has significantly hampered the country's economy and social life. The outcome will \nbe the financing and implementation of the proposed ensuing physical project for Upper Seti \nhydropower development, based on sufficient project preparation and effective design. The \ndelivery of the follow-on project is expected to promote development of clean hydropower \ngeneration for mitigating climate change.11  \n \n                                                 \n6  While an option to increase the generation capacity would be to install additional diesel-fired thermal power plants, \nthe recurrent costs for fuel and transportation would be burdensome. Another immediate option would be to import \nmore power from India where coal-fired thermal plants dominate. These options would have adverse impacts on \nclimate change. The development of domestic hydropower resources is considered critical in terms of the country's \nenergy security.  \n7  JICA. 2007.

Outputs \n8.  The Study will provide consulting services for each of two major engineering design \nspecifications: (i) civil works on geological risk assessments, and (ii) facilities on technical and \nhydrological  risk  assessments.  During  2006/07,  JICA  assessed  the  envisaged  physical \ninvestment  project  as  feasible  while  requiring  technical  investigation  to  refine  the  detailed \nproject design. It is essential for hydropower development to clarify the project's uncertain \nfactors and to incorporate preventive actions and risk mitigation measures in the project design, \nprior to financing decisions and implementation. To minimize project risks, the Study will focus \non geological and hydrological assessments through rock tests and hydraulic model simulation \nto establish engineering design parameters. The results will be included in the design drawings \nto be attached to the tender documents. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nSee Project Classification Summary and Contribution to the ADB Results Framework (Appendix \n2).  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n9.  The Study is estimated to cost $2.95 million, including consulting services, administrative \ncosts, and contingencies. The investment plan is summarized in Table 1. The details are in the \nproject administration manual (PAM).  \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Amount \nA.

The government has requested a grant not exceeding $2.50 million from ADB's Special \nFunds resources to help finance the Study for consulting services and contingencies. The \ngovernment  and  NEA  will  finance  $0.45  million  equivalent  of  local  currency  costs  for  the \nadministrative costs through in-kind contribution and taxes and duties, in accordance with the \ncost-sharing ceiling principle. The financing plan is summarized in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)    Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank (ADF grant) a  2.50    84.75 \nGovernment and NEA  0.45    15.25 \n  Total    2.95    100.00 \n    a  Exclusive of taxes and duties imposed in Nepal.   \nADF = Asian Development Fund, NEA = Nepal Electricity Authority. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n11.   While a detailed engineering design would normally need to be supported through a TA \nloan, a grant from Asian Development Fund (ADF) resources is being proposed for the Study \n ", "4 \ninstead of a TA loan due to the country's present debt distress position, in accordance with the \nrevised 2007 ADF grant framework.12 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.   NEA will be the executing agency with overall responsibility for execution of the Study. If \na special project company is established under NEA, it will be an implementing agency.13 The \nStudy  is  expected  to  start  in  October  2010  and  be  implemented  over  24  months.  The \ngovernment  and  NEA  asked  ADB  for  advance  contracting  for  consulting  services  with  a \nconsulting firm or consortium of firms to be selected by ADB.14 All procurement and consulting \nservices to be financed under the ADF grant will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The implementation arrangements \nare  summarized  in  Table  3  and  described  in  detail  in  the  PAM,  which  includes  the \nimplementation schedule, disbursements, audit, reporting, monitoring, evaluation, and outline \nterms of reference for consulting services under the Study. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2010\u2013September 2012 \nEstimated project completion date  30 September 2012 \nProject management \n(i)   Oversight body  Steering Committee: Chair: secretary, Ministry of Energy   \nMembers: joint secretary, Ministry of Finance; managing director; \nNEA; general manager, Engineering Services, NEA; general \nmanager, Generation, NEA \n(ii)  Executing agency  Nepal Electricity Authority \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  NEA or a special project company if established \n(iv)  Project implementation unit  Department of Engineering Services (at least six core staff ) \nConsulting services  QCBS  45 person-months  $2.5 million \nAdvance contracting  Consulting services \nDisbursementa  The grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the \ngovernment and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, NEA = Nepal Electricity Authority, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection.  \na  For guidance, refer to ADB. 2007.

Manila. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n12 The ADB Operations Manual section on technical assistance describes TA loans for detailed engineering design \n(OM D12/BP, para. 44), but also notes that a TA for detailed engineering design may be financed by a grant from \nADF resources depending on country circumstances (OM D12/OP, para. 6, footnote 8). The revised 2007 ADF \ngrant framework also mentions that no sector restrictions will be placed on the use of ADF grants or hard-term ADF \nloans; and that the processing and fiduciary guidelines for both facilities will be the same as those for regular ADF \nloans (ADB. 2007. Revising the Framework for Asian Development Fund Grants. Manila) \n13 Whether a special project company should be established or not will be studied during implementation of an \nassociated project preparatory TA for other diligence and preparatory works (para. 13). Setting up such a company \nmay have advantages to promote financial structuring, private participation, and accountability. \n14 Based on the written request from the government and NEA, ADB will undertake the consultant selection process \nfor the design consultant; NEA will retain its responsibility for contract negotiations and signing, and supervision of \nconsulting services.  \n ", "5 \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n13.  A separate project preparatory TA (the PPTA) will be attached to the Study mainly to \npromote project structuring and safeguard requirements as the Study covers only technical \naspects. To improve overall project preparedness for complex hydropower development, the \nPPTA will conduct thorough due diligence and concrete preparatory works mainly for financial \nstructuring,  institutional  setup,  safeguard  planning  and  advance  actions,  and  bid \ndocumentation.15 For  the  purposes,  country  partnership  strategy  programs  the  PPTA  for \nPreparing Hydropower Development for Energy Crisis, indicating the envisaged loan project for \n2012. The PPTA will be financed by a $2.0 million grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction, funded by the Government of Japan. The PPTA will be implemented concurrently \nwith the Study.16 The government and NEA asked ADB to provide advance contracting for the \nPPTA to facilitate project preparatory works in parallel with the Study. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n14.  The proposed ensuing investment project will be carefully assessed and prepared based \non the two-track due diligence and preparatory approaches of the Study and the PPTA.17 The \nStudy will mainly conduct technical due diligence while the PPTA's approach will scale up \nfocuses  on  sustainable  hydropower  development  with  particular  attention  to  safeguards, \nfinancing, partnerships, governance, and capacity building. While the Study and the PPTA will \ncarefully  review  and  prepare  the  project  design,  the  government  has  been  informed  that \napproval of the Study and the PPTA does not commit ADB to finance any follow-on project.  \n \nA.  Technical \n \n15.  The accessibility and location of the proposed ensuing project are considered good; it is \nabout 7 kilometers from the major highway near Pokhara (about 120 kilometers away from \nKathmandu). The transmission line to evacuate power generated from the plant is 39 kilometers \nfrom  the  nearest  substation.  Following  JICA's  feasibility  study  assessment,  the  Study  will \nexamine geological and hydrological conditions. To assess the least-cost design and solid \nstructure,  meticulous  material  tests  will  be  conducted.  A  hydraulic  model  will  be  used  to \nestablish the optimal technical design to ensure maximum generation capacity and minimum \nimpacts of sediments and backwater in engineering and environmental terms.18 This exercise \nwill help develop a least-cost solution by improving accuracy of the cost estimates. Identifying \nuncertain  technical  risks  will  make  bid  prices  more  competitive  and  resultant  benefits  are \nexpected to outweigh the study costs.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n16.  The  Study  will  not  directly  generate  financial  and  economic  returns;  financial  and \neconomic  internal  rates  of  return  will  not  be  applicable.19 The  proposed  ensuing  project's \nfinancial and economic viability will be examined under the PPTA, based on the suitable project \n                                                 \n15 The Study will assess detailed engineering design parameters, on which the PPTA will finalize the bidding \ndocuments defining the general qualification and technical specifications. The work scope between the Study and \nthe PPTA is provided in Due Diligence and Project Preparation Process (Appendix 2).  \n16 Outline Terms of Reference and Cost Estimates of Technical Assistance (Appendix 2). \n17 Due Diligence and Project Preparation Process (Appendix 2). \n18 The recent technological change in hydropower development has been less environmental intrusive, through \nimproved technologies such as hydrokinetic systems and hydraulic model tests.   \n19 For the ensuing physical project, JICA's feasibility study report indicates a base case financial internal rate of return \nof  10.3%  and  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  12.3%,  and  assesses  the  project  to  be  financially  and \neconomically viable even under sensitivity analyses. \n ", "6 \nstructure. The PPTA will promote financial structuring with the experienced private and public \ndevelopment partners through credit enhancements with emphasis on ADB's catalytic role.20 \n \n17.  Significant load shedding, particularly in the dry winter period, has generated significant \neconomic losses for the country. The additional generation capacity is essential for the country's \neconomy, representing national energy security.21 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n18.  Nepal\u2019s regulatory framework for the power sector is inadequate. As a result, private \nsector investment is limited and the country experiences major generation capacity constraints. \nTo create an enabling framework to overcome these constraints, ADB has been implementing a \ncapacity development TA for Promoting Private Sector Participation in the Power Sector,22 and \nprograms subsequent technical assistance for capacity building for energy institutions in 2010. \nIn line with this TA implementation, the PPTA aims to develop suitable options for financial \nstructuring  and  an  institutional  framework  in  collaboration  with  other  public  and  private \ndevelopment partners, to make demonstration effects for subsequent projects.23  \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and NEA. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (Appendix 2).  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n20.  The Study will not have direct poverty and social impacts. For due diligence on poverty, \nsocial, and gender issues of the proposed ensuing project, the PPTA will carry out full-scale \nsocial surveys and poverty and social analyses, and integrate findings into various social and \ngender action plans. See Initial Poverty and Social Analysis (Appendix 2).24   \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n21.  Because the work entails consulting services with no civil works, the Study's safeguard \ncategories are rated \"C\" for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \nJICA's feasibility study report assesses that the envisaged investment project will be feasible \nsocially and environmentally.25 Nevertheless, environmental and social safeguard measures will \nbe carefully reviewed and strengthened through the Study and the PPTA to prepare appropriate \nsafeguard plans in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).26 To ensure \npreparedness  and  smooth  implementation  of  the  follow-on  project,  the  PPTA  will  carefully \ndesign and implement public consultations with affected people with emphasis on effective \n                                                 \n20 Development Coordination (Appendix 2). \n21 Country Economic Indicators (Appendix 2). \n22 ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to Nepal for Promoting Private Sector Participation in the Power Sector. Manila. \n23 The PPTA will also study the project structuring options including public\u2013private partnership. \n24 The summary poverty reduction and social strategy will be developed during implementation of the PPTA.   \n25 The installed capacity of 127 MW is relatively smaller than other reservoir-type hydropower projects with hundreds \nand thousands of megawatts in the Himalayan region. Because of the natural topography with a narrow river and \ndeep valley, the overall size of the potential reservoir is relatively limited. JICA's feasibility study report indicates \nthat 86 households will need to be relocated (among them, relocation of 40 households is due to inundation). It \nalso indicates that 948 households will be fully or partially affected in total. For the comparison, the Kali Gandaki \n\u201cA\u201d Hydroelectric Project affected 1,468 households, including 217 households that were displaced or relocated.   \n26 The safeguard category for the PPTA and its ensuing project will be assessed during TA implementation. Under \nthe PPTA, a resettlement plan will be formulated and an indigenous peoples development plan prepared if needed.    \n ", "7 \ncommunication strategies and concrete advance actions for social safeguards.27 Social and \nenvironmental mitigation programs, including community development plans, will be prepared in \npartnership with nongovernment organization(s) and/or civil society.  \n \n22.  During the Study, a hydraulic model will be tested with computer simulations to analyze \nthe impacts of sedimentation and environmental mitigation measures. The Study will specify the \ndesign to protect riverbanks and to install early warning systems, paying attention to climate \nchange adaptation design. The PPTA will strengthen disaster risk management for local flood \nmanagement and ecosystem management, including fish hatcheries, implemented by the Kali \nGandaki \u201cA\u201d Hydroelectric Project. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n23.  The  Study's  major  implementation  risk  will  be  lack  of  consultant  experience.  The \nconsultant  selection  criteria  will  include  a  requirement  for  adequate  experience  in  similar \ndetailed engineering studies. The Study's output quality will also determine the PPTA's input \nvalue.  While  the  Study  and  the  PPTA  have  clearly  demarcated  responsibilities  for  the \nconsultants, the coordination mechanism between the two consultants needs to be clarified. \nConsidering the input\u2013output relationship, the consultant's engineering assessment under the \nStudy will be reviewed and guided by the PPTA consultant who will finalize the cost estimates \nand tender documents. This will be assured in the consulting services contracts for the Study \nand the PPTA.  \n \n24.  Adequate provision for contingencies will mitigate the risk of fund shortage for further \nstudies. The risk of implementation delay will be mitigated by advance contracting and close \nsupervision of ADB and the steering committee. The successful implementation of the two-track \nproject preparatory works through the Study and the PPTA will reduce the processing and \nimplementation risks of the ensuing investment project. Major risks and mitigating measures are \nsummarized in Table 4.28  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLack of the consultant's technical performance  Provision in the consultant selection criteria for \nadequate similar technical experience \nLack of coordination between the consultants for  Provision in the contracts defining supervision of \nthe detailed engineering study and the PPTA  the PPTA consultant  \nLack of funding for further investigation  Adequate provision of contingencies \nDelay in implementation   Advance contracting and close supervision of the \nsteering committee and ADB \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PPTA = project preparatory technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n25.  The government and NEA have assured ADB that implementation of the Study will \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and grant documents. The government and NEA have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the Study, which are set forth in the grant and project agreements.  \n                                                 \n27 JICA and NEA conducted public consultations. \n28 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \n26.  Anticorruption policy. ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any violations of the Anticorruption Policy relating to the Study. All contracts financed by \nADB shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of the executing agency and all program contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers. Individuals and/or entities on ADB's anticorruption debarment are ineligible to \nparticipate in ADB-financed activities and may not be awarded any contracts under the Study. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions are included in the grant agreements for the Study. \n \n27.  Consulting services, procurement, and disbursement guidelines. All consultants will \nbe recruited according to ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The procurement of \ngoods, related services, and works financed by the grant will follow procedures outlined in \nADB's Procurement Guidelines if any. The grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n28.  Counterpart  funding.  The  government  and  NEA  will  ensure  adequate  counterpart \nfunding  to  complete  the  Study.  Any  shortfall  of  funding  required  will  be  assured  by  the \ngovernment and NEA.  \n \n29.  Grant effectiveness condition. As a condition to grant effectiveness, the government \nshall execute a subsidiary grant agreement with NEA upon terms and conditions satisfactory to \nADB.
