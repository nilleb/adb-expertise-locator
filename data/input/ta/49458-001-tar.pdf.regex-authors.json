INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) recognizes gender equity as an essential driver of \nchange  for  promoting  and  achieving  inclusive  and  sustainable  growth  and  improving  well-\nbeing.1 In the Pacific region, ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach emphasizes capacity building and the \nincorporation  of  gender  mainstreaming  into  the  core  function  of  governments  in  Pacific \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs).2 ADB\u2019s support to gender equity in the Pacific was \ndeveloped through 2010 regional technical assistance (TA) that supported strengthening of the \ntechnical capacity of selected Pacific countries. The TA provided training on the use of gender \nstatistics, produced a regional booklet on key gender indicators, and performed in-depth gender \nassessments in several Pacific DMCs (Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Timor-\nLeste).3 This  contribution  to  gender  mainstreaming  was  recognized  and  valued  by  other \ndevelopment partners and governments as part of country programming. \n  \n2.  The TA for Promoting Evidence-Based Policy Making for Gender Equity in the Pacific \n(Phase 2) seeks to strengthen the capacity of governments in selected Pacific DMCs to monitor \ngender  situations  systematically,  including  reporting  against  the  Sustainable  Development \nGoals (SDGs) and within ADB projects.4 The TA will also analyze gender equity in the health \nsector, given the importance of health to the overall well-being of women. The objective, scope, \nimplementation arrangements, cost and financing arrangements, and terms of reference for the \nTA are based on the previous TA demonstrating a continuity of ADB\u2019s approach to gender \nequity in the Pacific. The TA is included in the regional operations business plan, 2016\u20132018.5 \nThe design and monitoring framework for the TA is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Pacific DMCs experience common concerns and challenges in achieving the SDGs, \nincluding Goal 5 on gender equity. Papua New Guinea and the Federated States of Micronesia \ndid not achieve the Millennium Development Goal 5 of improving maternal health. Papua New \nGuinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu did not achieve the targets for universal access \nto reproductive health.6 Furthermore, rising obesity and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are \nhaving consequences on premature adult mortality and life expectancy in Fiji, Samoa and \nTonga.7 Low participation of women in the formal economy and decision-making process, along \nwith  widespread  gender-based  violence  (Pacific  countries  have  some  of  the  highest \ndocumented rates in the world), are critical concerns for improving women\u2019s overall well-being \nand status.8  \n \n4.  Across the Pacific, gender equity is being supported through different strategies. Pacific \nWomen Shaping Pacific Development (Pacific Women), funded by the Government of Australia, \nsupports 14 Pacific countries to meet the commitments made in the 2012 Pacific Island Forum \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

Gender awareness is also an issue at national and regional levels. At the 2015 46th \nPacific Islands Forum, Pacific leaders reaffirmed their commitment to implementation of the \n2012 Pacific Leaders Gender Equality Declaration (footnote 11). While progress on gender \nequality  has  been  notable  in  three  of  the  six  key  areas\u2014gender  responsive  policies  and \nprograms, gender parity in education, and ending violence against women\u2014less progress has \nbeen  made  on  women\u2019s  economic  empowerment,  and  sexual,  reproductive,  and  health \nservices.12 In 2015 Pacific leaders included for discussion during the regional forum the growing \ncervical cancer burden, and agreed on regional prioritization of NCDs to respond to cervical \ncancer. The focus on NCDs as a health priority is growing, but little is known about the gender \nelements of both risk factors (apart from STEPS surveys)13 and the NCD burden distribution. \nTraditional gender data focus on sexual and reproductive health and maternal health outcomes. \nTherefore, a gap exists in identifying the dominant health challenges experienced by women \nacross the Pacific and designing policies to target health interventions to suit their needs. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact will be the development of gender-responsive government programs and \npolicies.  The  outcome  will  be  strengthened  institutional  and  technical  capacity  for  gender \nmainstreaming in participating DMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The proposed TA seeks to assist additional countries to those supported under the \nprevious TA, using similar strategies of capacity building in government ministries to collect and \nanalyze gender situations across key social and economic areas. The activities will be anchored \nin the SDG framework and be carried out in close cooperation with the Social Development, \nGovernance, and Gender Division to ensure an aligned ADB strategy for gender mainstreaming \nand supporting DMCs report on progress towards the SDGs targets. By focusing on the health \nsector, this TA will increase evidence of the awareness of gender as a direct or indirect factor of \n                                                \n9   Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. 2012.

It is coordinated by national authorities of the implementing country. STEPS surveys \nhave been conducted across Pacific DMCs, but most are over 10 years old.  \n ", "3 \n \nwomen\u2019s  survival.  If  the  approach  of  this  TA  is  successful,  additional  financing  may  be \nconsidered to expand activities to other DMCs. \n \n8.  Output 1: Summary gender profiles of select Pacific developing member countries \nbased on the Sustainable Development Goal framework. The profiles will be more succinct \nthan the gender assessments developed under the previous TA, but still highlight country \ngender priorities and data. Initially, four profiles will be prepared; Kiribati, Marshall Islands, \nSamoa, and Tonga have been tentatively identified as target DMCs. The activities (workshops, \ndata analysis, reports) will be carried out in close collaboration with the Pacific Community \n(SPC), which will provide TA and training support to countries to collect and analyze statistics. \n \n9.  Output  2:  Support  for  gender  mainstreaming  in  ADB  operations  to  report  on \nSustainable Development Goals. Following on from the previous TA, this output will support \ngender mainstreaming in ADB projects by building the technical capacity of executing and \nimplementing  agencies  to  identify  gender  issues,  and  monitor  and  report  on  performance \nagainst  project  gender  action  plans.  This  TA  will  cooperate  and  collaborate  with  other \ndevelopment partners working on gender issues (e.g., UN Women and the Government of \nAustralia)  to  consolidate  and  strengthen  ongoing  efforts  for  capacity  building  and  gender-\ninclusive development. The selection of DMCs will be based on country demand and location of \nADB operations with gender equity and effective gender mainstreaming categorization. \n \n10.  Output  3:  Gender  assessment  in  the  health  sector. Given  that  women\u2019s  health \noutcomes are critical for promoting their productive capacities and achieving gender equality, \nthis TA will undertake a more in-depth analysis of emerging health issues for women beyond \nclassic gender health indicators (antenatal service and supervised delivery). More specifically, it \nwill assess the effectiveness of the health information systems and other data sources to \ncapture gender indicators (e.g., demographic household surveys, population-based national \nhealth surveys, health facility surveys, national health information systems, and vital statistics). \nThe assessment will cover critical health issues, including gender-based violence and NCDs, \nwhich constrain progress toward gender equality. This TA will collaborate with SPC and the \nWorld Health Organization, which support Pacific countries through technical support. Gender \nassessments in the health sector will also help ADB explore potential health sector investments. \n \n11.  The main risks to achieving the outputs are a reduction in the budget allocation for \nhealth and women ministries, and a high turnover rate or a change of government, leading to \nlack of continuity in capacity-building training. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $525,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The TA will be implemented from October 2016 to January 2019. ADB will be the \nexecuting agency, responsible for the overall management and monitoring of the TA activities. \nThe Pacific Department will be the focal department within ADB. Implementing agencies will be \nthe ministries or departments responsible for women\u2019s affairs and/or ministries or departments \nof health in participating DMCs. The DMCs will designate a TA focal point and assistant to \nreview reports and coordinate activities and in-kind contributions. \n ", "4 \n \n \n14.  The TA will require a total of 24 person-months of individual consulting services from \nfour  national  and  two  international  consultants:  (i)  national  coordinators  to  coordinate  TA \nactivities (10 person-months); (ii) international health and gender specialist (9 person-months, \nintermittent); and (iii) international gender statistics and capacity building specialist (5 person-\nmonths, intermittent). All consultants will be recruited and hired individually according to ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The specific terms \nof reference for each consultant may vary from country to country, depending on the needs and \npriorities of each participating DMC. ADB will finalize the terms of reference for consultants, \nincluding the duration and expected results. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix  3.  Proceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).14 \n \n15.  A no-objection letter from participating DMCs will be obtained before TA activities begin \nin each country. A TA collaboration agreement outlining roles and responsibilities will be signed \nby ADB and other agencies (e.g., UN Women or the SPC) working on gender in the Pacific. All \ngender indicators compiled under the TA will be harmonized with the SPC regional framework, \nand they will be provided to the SPC regional database. The SPC will serve as an additional \nimplementing agency in supporting regional activities related to gender indicators, including \ncapacity building, the compilation of gender indicators, and regional publications. \n \n16.  Progress will be monitored using the intended outcomes and outputs described in the \ndesign and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). The consultants will provide quarterly progress \nreports  and  completion  reports,  detailing  the  work  programs  and  achievements  of  their \nrespective TA activities. ADB will conduct periodic review missions to monitor TA activities. The \nTA results will be disseminated to participating DMCs as knowledge products and through \nregional events. Four summary gender profiles will be produced, and a report on key health \nissues for women and how health systems can be strengthened to respond to them will be \nproduced for knowledge sharing. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nPromoting Evidence-Based Policy Making for Gender Equity in the Pacific (Phase 2), and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n14  Output-based and/or lump-sum contracts will be considered in the engagement of consulting services to reduce \nthe administrative burden and improve economy, efficiency, and value for money. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the TA is Aligned with \nGender-responsive government programs and policiesa  \n \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \ninstitutional and  a.
