THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based loan to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 2 of the Local Governance \nReform Program.1  \n \n2.  The program aims to strengthen the capacities of local government units (LGUs) to deliver \nhigh-quality public services. It builds upon the government\u2019s local governance reform priorities to \n(i) strengthen the local governance framework, (ii) modernize and professionalize subnational \npublic  financial  management  (PFM),  and  (iii)  improve  the  LGU  financing  and  investment \nframework.   \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Programmatic approach and budget support. The program embraces a programmatic \napproach to align the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) support with the government\u2019s medium- \nto long-term efforts to foster more accountable, more transparent, and better public service \ndelivery by LGUs. In turn, services will boost local economic development and help reduce \npoverty and regional disparities. ADB approved the programmatic approach, comprising two \nsubprograms,  on  13  November  2019.2 Subprogram  1  was  supported  through  a  loan  of  \n$300 million, and consisted of 15 prior actions that empowered and equipped LGUs to meet the \nneeds of citizens, improved the capacity of LGUs to raise their own revenue, and lowered the cost \nof doing business for the private sector (footnote 2). All the prior actions completed in subprogram \n1 have been maintained, with no reversals. Subprogram 2 builds upon the achievements under \nsubprogram 1 and the tools and measures under ADB\u2019s related project loan.3 The post-program \npartnership framework, 2021\u20132024 will enable ADB to continue supporting the government\u2019s local \ngovernance reform agenda.  \n \n4.  Local  governance  reform  to  support  coronavirus  disease  pandemic  recovery. \nBefore the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the Philippines sustained strong growth \naveraging 6.4% in 2010\u20132019. Macroeconomic policy was appropriate to support economic \ngrowth in the medium term.4 The country\u2019s debt profile was assessed to be sustainable, with \nsound fiscal risk and public debt management strategies in place.5 The Philippines consistently \nreduced the national poverty rate from 26.6% in 2006 to 16.6% in 2018;6 however, income \ninequality and regional disparities were still prevalent as the Gini coefficient stood at 0.43 in 2018, \nexceeding that of regional peers and relatively unchanged from 0.44 in 2015. For example, the \npoverty  rate  remained  considerably  higher  in  remote  regions  such  as  the  Bangsamoro \nAutonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (61.3%), Zamboanga Peninsula (32.7%), and Eastern \nVisayas (30.9%). Now, the COVID-19 pandemic stands to erode the gains made in poverty \nreduction and exacerbate regional and gender-based disparities.

Manila. \n \n ", " \n2 \ncontracted by 9.6% in 2020 against the original forecast of 6.2% growth.7 ADB estimates that the \nnational poverty rate could increase to about 20% in 2020 from 16.6% in 2018, which equates to \nan additional 5.5 million people falling into poverty. Women and girls are particularly vulnerable \nas they face challenges to their well-being, such as reduced access to healthcare services, \ngender-based violence, and economic insecurity.8 Recognizing the role of LGUs in pro-poor and \npro-women responses to COVID-19, the government has stepped up local governance reform as \npart of the national strategies for social and economic recovery.9 Hence, strong LGU capacity to \nmanage fiscal resources and deliver public services backed by a robust policy framework is critical \nto reinstating strong growth trajectories. \n \nBox 1: Mandanas Ruling and Executive Order Number 138  \n \nThe Supreme Court ruling on the Mandanas\u2013Garcia case (Mandanas ruling), finalized on 10 April 2019, \nmandates that the base national government revenues against which the mandated 40% internal \nrevenue allotments to local government units (LGUs) are determined is not limited to national internal \nrevenue taxes collected by the Bureau of Internal Revenue but includes all national taxes including tariffs, \ncustoms duties, and other taxes, fees, and charged collected by agents of the national government \nincluding the Bureau of Customs. This will facilitate LGUs to take on more responsibilities in line with the \n1991 Local Government Code, which would also be aligned with the decentralization principle of funding \nfollowing functions. The government envisages implementation of the Mandanas ruling as a key \ninstrument of the coronavirus disease pandemic response, as it contains measures that would help \nimprove the quality of local public service delivery and reduce poverty and unemployment in local \ncommunities through local governance reforms.  \n \nIn response to the need to accelerate local governance reforms and organizational transitions of the \nnational government and LGUs, the President of the Philippines, on 1 June 2021, signed the Executive \nOrder Number 138 titled  Full  Devolution  of Certain Functions of  the  Executive Branch  to Local \nGovernments, Creation of A Committee on Devolution, and For Other Purposes. The Executive Order \ndirects the full devolution of functions from the national government to LGUs in line with the Mandanas \nruling. It will ensure that the policy of decentralization as enshrined in the Constitution and the 1991 Local \nGovernment Code, as well as the increase in the internal revenue allotments for LGUs as provided for \nin the Mandanas ruling, will be carried out systematically and smoothly, by: (i) establishing oversight and \nmonitoring mechanisms to resolve issues and concerns that may arise in the implementation of the \nMandanas ruling; (ii) setting up the Growth Equity Fund to address issues on marginalization, unequal \ndevelopment, high poverty incidence, and disparities in capacities of LGUs; and (iii) adopting transition \nplans to ensure the continuous service delivery by the national government agencies and LGUs. \n \nLGUs = local government units. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n5.  Need for gearing up local governance reforms. Subprogram 2 comes at a critical \njuncture for the Philippines, when public attention to, and demand for, devolution of public services \nis increasing. The 1991 Local Government Code (LGC) underpinned decentralization of service \ndelivery, taxing powers, and certain regulatory functions. Local fiscal performance since then has \nbeen strengthened gradually, yet consistently. LGUs\u2019 locally sourced revenue grew by 22.6% \nduring 2017\u20132019. However, LGUs still rely heavily on internal revenue allotments (IRA) from the \nnational government as their main source of income, thereby limiting fiscal responsibility and \nautonomy. Own-source revenue accounted for 32% of total LGU revenue in 2019\u2014below the \n \n7  Philippine Statistics Authority. 2021. Press Release: Q4 2020 National Accounts of the Philippines. Manila. \n8  United Nations Women. 2020. Gender Snapshot: COVID-19 in the Philippines. Bangkok. \n9  Inter-Agency Task Force. 2020. We Recover as One. Manila. Under Republic Act 11494, known as Bayanihan to \nRecover as One Act, the government has allocated \u20b11.5 billion ($31 million) for the Local Government Support Fund \nto support LGUs in their COVID-19 relief efforts. \n ", " \n3 \ngovernment target of 37% of total local revenue by 2022\u2014and was particularly low among \nprovinces (16%) and municipalities (18%). Moreover, the absorptive capacities of LGUs need to \nbe  further  strengthened  to  support  the  transition  to  full  devolution  of  public  services  as \nnecessitated by the Mandanas ruling.10 The Department of Budget and Management estimates \nthat the ruling will increase the IRA in fiscal year (FY) 2022 by 38% in comparison with FY2021, \nequivalent to $5.5 billion (\u20b1263 billion) or 1% of GDP.11 As a result, the need to strengthen local \ngovernance reform has accelerated to ensure that additional fiscal resources for LGUs lead to \nimproved service delivery. \n \n6.  Binding constraints. The government has identified the challenges to be tackled to \nrealize the goal of people-centered, clean, and efficient local governance. These challenges, \nwhich still hinder the ability of the LGUs to fulfill the 1991 LGC mandates and to deliver quality \nlocal services, include: (i) weaknesses in implementing and monitoring frameworks for LGUs;  \n(ii)  ineffective  tools  and  incentives  for  LGUs  to  deliver  high-quality  public  services;  and  \n(iii) insufficient participation of the private sector, citizens, and stakeholders in local service \ndelivery.12 \n \n7.  Weaknesses in implementing and monitoring frameworks for local government \nunits. The 1991 LGC and its subsequent amendments have provided regulatory frameworks for \nLGUs to become self-reliant, and transparent and accountable to their citizens. However, central\u2013\nlocal and interlocal coordination remains inadequate because of unclear and overlapping roles \nand functions, hampering the ability of LGUs to perform their mandates (e.g., raising local \nrevenues, delivering public services, and preparing for emerging challenges such as gender \ndevelopment and climate change). Likewise, gender-responsive planning and budgeting need to \nbe improved, and local planning needs to be more aligned with national and international \ndevelopment goals. Effective monitoring is needed to track performance against result-oriented \nperformance indicators. The government has taken steps to streamline the roles and functions of \nnational and local governments. However, much work still needs to be done. For instance, while \nproperty prices grew by 15% yearly in 2009\u20132018, real property taxes collected by LGUs declined \nby more than 8% annually during the same period.13 Many LGUs have not been able to fulfill the \nstatutory expenditure requirement, which obliges them to devote at least 20% of their annual \nbudgets to development projects and at least 5% to gender and development (GAD).14 \n \n8.  Ineffective tools and incentives for local government units. As of 2018, the budget \nexecution rate among LGUs was low, at 72.2% of the total budget and merely 43.9% for capital \noutlays, indicating ineffective local service delivery.15 The low absorptive capacity of LGUs has \nseveral  causes,  such  as  unclear  and  overlapping  responsibilities  of  national  and  local \ngovernments; inefficient budget planning and execution; and low capacity to develop programs, \nprojects, and activities. However, under the Mandanas ruling, additional financing will be provided, \nand more responsibilities and functions will be cascaded from the national government to LGUs. \nThe government has implemented a wide array of measures and tools to improve the absorptive \ncapacities of LGUs. For example, the Standardized Examination and Assessment for Local \n \n10 Government of the Philippines. 2020. What Is Mandanas Ruling?

Technical Assistance to the Republic of the \nPhilippines for Strengthening Tax and Fiscal Policy Capacity for Inclusive Growth). Manila. \n14 Joint Memorandum Circular 2017\u20131 requires at least 20% of annual budgets for social development projects and \nbasic infrastructure. Republic Act 9710 (Magna Carta of Women) requires at least 5% for gender development. \n15 Commission on Audit. 2019. 2018 Annual Financial Report: Local Government Volume I. Manila. \n \n ", " \n4 \nTreasury  Service  Program  put  in  place  a  competency  and  assessment  framework  to \nprofessionalize local treasurers. The LGU integrated financial tool (LIFT) and a fiscal sustainability \nscorecard for LGUs were introduced to incentivize local treasurers and budget officers to embrace \ninternational best practices for local PFM and to modernize and improve local fiscal reporting. \nHowever, these tools and incentives emphasize compliance with legal mandates rather than \nimproving  the  quality  of  public  services.  Therefore,  LGU  capacities  need  to  be  further \nstrengthened to meet service standards such as citizen satisfaction and accountable gender and \nsocial development. \n \n9.  Insufficient participation of the private sector, citizens, and stakeholders in local \nservice delivery. Filling the fiscal gaps and meeting the expenditure needs of LGUs remain a \nchallenge on many fronts. LGUs rely heavily on IRA transfers as their main source of financing. \nThe private sector faces high costs of doing business as many LGUs still have not complied with \nthe requirements of the Ease of Doing Business Act. The capacity of LGUs to access private \nsector financing is typically limited, contributing to poor service delivery. The implementation of \nthe Mandanas ruling in 2022 will increase the opportunity to finance priority development projects \nand capital expenditures and to improve municipal financing and borrowing. Typically, LGUs \npursue public\u2013private partnership (PPP) projects through joint ventures. However, the PPP \n \nCenter\u2019s project development and monitoring facility (PDMF) can only support local PPP projects \nunder the Build\u2013Operate\u2013Transfer Law which does not cover joint ventures. Many local projects \n   \nare small and may not have enough economies of scale to attract private sector interest. An \ninnovative approach to private sector participation in these small, yet critical, local projects is \nneeded. Further, LGUs also play a critical role in community relief and recovery from natural \nhazard  events.  Disaster  risk  financing  for  LGUs  needs  to  be  strengthened  with  effective \nmeasurement and monitoring of resilience readiness. Finally, continued efforts are required to \namplify citizen feedback, alongside LGU transparency and accountability to citizens. \n \n10.  Alignment with government\u2019s national plan and ADB\u2019s priorities. The program is a \nkey part of ADB\u2019s support to help the government ensure people-centered, clean, and efficient \nlocal governance, in line with the Updated Philippine Development Plan (PDP), 2017\u20132022.16 The \nprogram will support the second pillar of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2018\u20132023, on \npromoting local economic development.17 Subprogram 2 is aligned with the following operational \npriorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) reducing remaining poverty and inequalities; (ii) accelerating \nprogress in gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment; (iii) tackling climate change, building \nclimate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  increasing  environmental  sustainability;  and  \n(iv) strengthening governance and institutional capacity.18 \n \nB.  Policy Reform, ADB\u2019s Value Addition, and Sustainability \n \n11.  Government\u2019s reform agenda. Since the enactment of the 1991 LGC, the government \nhas made gradual, yet consistent progress in improving the efficiency and transparency of LGUs. \nIn  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  government  has  begun  to  accelerate  local \ngovernance reforms toward devolution of public services and improved delineation of national \ngovernment and LGU functions. With the 2009 Climate Change Act and the Intended Nationally \nDetermined Contributions under the Paris Agreement, the government envisages the Local \nGovernance Reform Program as a continuing effort to strengthen the country\u2019s resilience to \n \n16 National Economic and Development Authority. 2021.

Reform accomplishments. At the inception of the program in 2018, the government \nagreed to accomplish 19 prior actions as the basis for subprogram 2. There has been no deviation \nfrom the indicative policy actions originally established for subprogram 2. During the processing \nof subprogram 2, 10 prior actions (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 14\u201316, and 18) were strengthened to boost \ngender responsiveness, reflect the progress of implementation beyond expectations, and better \ncapture development impact. All prior actions in subprogram 2 have been accomplished.20 \n \nBox 2: Key Accomplishments under the Local Governance Reform Program, Subprogram 2  \n \nThe government has accomplished the following as part of subprogram 2: \n(i)  Increased fund allocation to support devolution of functions. Implemented the Mandanas \nrulinga to provide LGUs with greater internal revenue allocations and clearer roles and functions \nfrom the 2022 national budget, and approved Executive Order Number 138 on Full Devolution \nof Functions to LGUs to institute a legal framework for the Mandanas ruling; \n(ii)  Expedited  measures  to  boost  LGUs\u2019  own-source  revenue.  Established  the  property \nvaluation office and the Bureau of Local Government Finance Management Committee to \naccelerate the implementation and oversight of the real property valuation and assessment \nreform; \n(iii) Improved local monitoring. Rolled out a real-time local development investment program \nmonitoring framework and GAD budget monitoring framework; \n(iv) Aligned LGU investments to achieve SDGs. Set aside at least 35% of local funds for GAD, \nyouth  development,  and  local  development  projects,  and  aligned  them  with  the  national \ndevelopment and investment plans and SDGs; \n(v)  Professionalized local public financial management. Expanded tools and incentives for \nLGUs to fill service delivery gaps for women and vulnerable groups; continued to professionalize \nlocal treasurers and local budget officers using information technology; and \n(vi) Strengthened the local investment climate. Expanded PPP frameworks to promote local PPP \nproject development; reduced the cost of doing business by requiring LGU business processes \nto comply with the Ease of Doing Business Act, and improved citizen feedback. \n \nGAD  =  gender  and  development,  LGU  =  local  government  unit,  PPP  =  public\u2013private  partnership,  \nSDGs = Sustainable Development Goals. \na  The details of the Mandanas ruling and the Executive Order Number 138 on Full Devolution of Functions to LGUs \nare provided in Box 1. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n13.  Reform area 1: Strengthening the local governance framework for service delivery. \nThis reform area reinforces existing legal and implementing frameworks to improve central\u2013local \nand  interlocal  coordination,  and  to  boost  the  capacity  of  LGUs  for  managing  larger \nintergovernmental fiscal transfers and devolution of public services. The reform area builds upon \nthe accomplishments of subprogram 1 by strengthening LGUs\u2019 accountability and responsiveness \nto  the  need  for  service  delivery  and  own-source  revenue  mobilization.  There  were  five \n \n19 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Comparison of Original and Revised Subprogram 2 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", " \n6 \naccomplishments under subprogram 2. First, the government incorporated the increased IRA for \nLGUs in the preparation of the 2022 national budget in line with the Mandanas ruling, and more \nclearly delineated national and local government roles.21 The government approved Executive \nOrder Number 138 on the Full Devolution of Functions to LGUs to institute a legal framework to \nimplement the Mandanas ruling and transition plans.22 This reform measure prepared LGUs to \nmeet their increased responsibilities for service delivery arising from the increase in IRA shares \nfrom  FY2022  onward.  Second,  the  government  set  up  the  property  valuation  office  and \nestablished  the  Bureau  of  Local  Government  Finance  (BLGF)  Management  Committee  to \noversee the overall implementation of the Real Property Valuation and Assessment Reform and \nto provide technical and policy advice and coordination support to the Department of Finance \n(DOF) and agencies concerned with ensuring the reform\u2019s success.23 \n \n14.  Third, to improve monitoring and coordination, the government rolled out an online system \nfor real-time submission and tracking of the Local Development Investment Program (e-LDIP) \nand  adopted  the  GAD  plan  budget  monitoring  system  (GAD-PBMS).24 The  e-LDIP  and  \nGAD-PBMS enable the national government to track and report local government planning and \nbudgeting,  and  to mainstream  gender  perspectives  in  local  government  plans.  Fourth,  the \ngovernment  strengthened  local  planning  and  budget  frameworks  under  National  Budget \nMemorandum Number 136, which requires the investment programs of LGUs to align with the \nPDP, 2017\u20132022; the Public Investment Program, 2017\u20132022; and the SDGs. The frameworks \nmandated that LGUs utilize local budgets to meet statutory expenditure requirements such as at \nleast 5% for GAD, 10% for youth development and empowerment (Sangguniang Kabataan), and \n20% for development projects. Last, the national government\u2019s oversight of local planning and \nbudgeting was reinforced by formulating provincial results matrixes for the PDP, 2017\u20132022. The \ngovernment improved several existing guidelines and manuals25 and provided training to LGUs \nand regional government offices to strengthen their capacity to review local plans, revenue \nmobilization, and budgets. \n \n15.  Reform  area  2:  Modernizing  and  professionalizing  local  public  financial \nmanagement. This reform area addresses bureaucratic weaknesses and inefficiencies in local \nPFM. Subprogram 1 introduced a wide range of PFM tools and measures to improve local PFM \nfunctions, including the Standardized Examination and Assessment for Local Treasury Service \nProgram, the LIFT PFM system, and the Fiscal Sustainability Scorecard. Subprogram 2 continued \nto professionalize core public finance functions and expand tools and incentives to promote \nefficient and high-quality delivery of public services. First, the government improved and linked \nthe LGU e-Budget Preparation Module with the BLGF and Department of the Interior and Local \nGovernment (DILG) systems, and integrated monitoring of GAD and environmental data. The \nenhancements enabled LGUs and the national government to produce a consolidated set of PFM \ndata and reports, thereby improving efficiency, transparency, and oversight of local budget \n \n21 Under the delineation plan, national government roles will be limited to: (i) setting national policy and service \nstandards; (ii) assisting, overseeing, and monitoring LGUs; and (iii) strengthening capacities of LGUs. \n22 Executive Order Number 138 approved on 1 June 2021 is titled Full Devolution of Certain Functions of the Executive \nBranch to Local Governments, Creation of A Committee on Devolution, and For Other Purposes. The Department of \nBudget and Management has likewise issued the Local Budget Memorandum Number 82 dated 14 June 2021 to \ninform LGUs of their indicative national tax allotment shares in FY 2022 and to guide LGUs\u2019 preparation of the FY \n2022 annual budgets. \n23 DOF\u2019s Department Order Number 2 (2021) titled Implementation and Operationalization of Executive Order Number \n833 (2019). \n24 The Local Development Investment Program allocates LGUs\u2019 general budgets to programs, projects, and activities. \n25 These include: (i) the updated policy for the Model Local Revenue Code, (ii) the updated Local Treasury Operations \nManual, and (iii) the updated guidelines on the assessment of the comprehensive development plans of cities and \nmunicipalities. \n ", " \n7 \nplanning and utilization. Second, the government strengthened the minimum PFM performance \nstandards for the Seal of Good Local Governance (SGLG), which requires LGUs to prioritize \ngender development and social protection, and bridge service delivery gaps for women and \nvulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, and people with disabilities. The upgraded SGLG \ncriteria include the fiscal sustainability of LGUs and increased spending on priority sectors such \nas social protection, health, and education. As of December 2019, 442 LGUs (26% of total LGUs) \nhad passed the new SGLG criteria. \n \n16.  The government also introduced five critical capacity development initiatives to further \nprofessionalize local treasurers and budget officers: (i) electronic capacity development platforms \nfor building the core competencies of local treasurers and budget officers; (ii) a competency \nassessment and measurement system for local budget officers;26 (iii) advanced competency in \nthe local treasury examination and certification system for local treasurers; (iv) an electronic \ncompendium of DOF and BLGF rulings, issuances, and policy guidance; and (v) implementation \nof the PFM assessment tool for all LGUs.27 These competency assessment tools boost career \nadvancement in local civil services and directly benefit local treasurers and budget officers, of \nwhom 50% are female. \n \n17.  Reform area 3: Improving the local government unit financing and investment \nframework.  This  reform  area  eases  fiscal  constraints  on  local  service  delivery.  The \naccomplishments under subprogram 1 included the Ease of Doing Business Act and regulations \nfor localized parametric disaster risk insurance. Subprogram 2 continued to expand LGU access \nto private sector and disaster risk financing and to create a conducive business environment for \nlocal development. First, the BLGF finalized and submitted the House Bill on Mandatory Calamity \nInsurance to the Congress, which requires all LGUs to insure their assets. Second, the DILG \ncompleted the LGU Resilience Readiness Monitoring Framework assessment in 40 pilot LGUs in \n2020.28 The use of a results-based performance tool helped to fill capacity gaps in disaster risk \nreduction and management through better local planning and budgeting. Third, the PPP Center \nissued regulations to expand the scope of the PDMF to help LGUs pursue PPP projects through \njoint ventures pursuant to the local PPP Code or joint venture ordinance of the LGUs. Fourth, the \nPPP Center rolled out the Business Case Initiative to help LGUs develop robust business cases \nfor small-scale local PPP projects, with consideration of gender and social safeguards, climate \nresilience, and gender-responsive policies and guidelines. Fifth, the government rationalized \nsetting local fees and charges across LGUs on a cost-recovery basis, and rolled out an electronic \nsingle-service window\u2014the Business One-Stop Shop\u2014to reduce the cost of doing business and \nspeed up the issuance of business permits.29 Sixth, the government enhanced the Rate-My-LGU \nService, an online LGU client rating system, with gender monitoring and reporting to encourage \ncitizen feedback and to incentivize LGUs to be more responsive to gender-specific needs. Last, \nthe BLGF developed an online public fiscal reporting dashboard and local tax calculator to \nincrease transparency and accountability of LGUs.  \n \n18.  Sustainability  and  post-program  partnership  framework.  The  post-program \npartnership framework reflects the government\u2019s commitment to sustaining accomplishments in \n \n26 The competency assessment comprises three components: (i) competency modeling for local budget officers,  \n(ii) the e-Competency Assessment Tool, and (iii) competency assessment of local budget officers. \n27 As of December 2019, 1,359 out of a total of 1,715 LGUs had completed the PFM tool, with an average score of 2.97 \nand with 54% of LGUs assessed as satisfactory (score of 3.0 or higher). Internal and external audit was the most \nlagging indicator.   \n28 Based on the results of the 40 pilot LGUs in 2020, the LGU Resilience Readiness Monitoring Framework mean score \nwas 0.352 or lower, with a range from 0.227 (low) to 0.575 (moderate). \n29 BLGF Memorandum Circular 20 (September 2019) provides the guidelines for setting local fees and charges. \n \n ", " \n8 \nall three reform areas. The measures to ensure sustainability include: (i) developing LGUs\u2019 \ntransition  plans  and  an  equalization  mechanism  for  the  full  devolution  of  public  services;  \n(ii) providing technical advice and capacity building for effective implementation of the property \nvaluation office; (iii) designing and piloting land value capture mechanisms to supplement the real \nproperty valuation reform, and encouraging private sector participation in local infrastructure;  \n(iv) establishing the master plan for the Local Government Academy for LGUs to sustain the \ncapacity building being provided to local treasurers and budget officers; and (v) strengthening \nLGU capacity to develop pro-poor, pro-women local investments, including social protection \nprojects.30  The measures may lead to a new program to support devolved public services, good \nlocal governance, and local revenue mobilization. \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s past engagement. ADB has been a key long-term partner for local governance \nreform in the Philippines, providing programmatic lending, project investment, and technical \nassistance.  In  2006\u20132010,  the  Local  Government  Financing  and  Budget  Reform  Program \nstrengthened the capacity of LGUs to deliver services in line with the 1991 LGC.31 In 2010\u20132016, \nthe Local Government Finance and Fiscal Decentralization Reform Program sustained the thrust \nof local governance reforms by focusing on the financial capacity of LGUs to fund improved \nservice delivery.32 Subsequently, the program stepped up these reforms by focusing on the quality \nand efficiency of service delivery under existing structures, while equipping LGUs with the tools, \nskills, and incentives to better perform their roles. The Local Governance Reform Project (footnote \n3) approved in 2020 has helped the BLGF develop the property valuation and transaction \ndatabase system which strengthened and modernized the functions of the property valuation \noffice accomplished under subprogram 2. \n \nFigure: ADB\u2019s Engagement on Local Governance and Public Financial Management \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n20.  Lessons. ADB\u2019s experience provided five key lessons that have been incorporated into \nsubprogram 2. First, decentralization requires long-term efforts and is sustainable when LGUs \nalign their local priorities with national development plans and the SDGs. Such linkage provides \n \n30 The post-program partnership framework will be financed by ADB\u2019s technical assistance (ADB. 2019.

Second, \nchanges in tools and regulations must be accompanied with measures to provide local incentives \nand the ability to gauge performance against a well-defined set of standards to maximize impact. \nThird, local governance reform should be supplemented with project investment to help LGUs \nimprove PFM.33 Fourth, local governance reform is successful when backed by the inclusive \nparticipation of community members. Participation of women and marginalized groups can be \nstrengthened if local planning and service delivery are carried out in a gender-sensitive manner. \nFinally, public communications and stakeholders\u2019 engagement are essential for successful local \ngovernance reform. Under subprogram 2, ADB supported the government for the consultative \nprocesses  with  LGUs,  local  communities,  the  civil  society  organizations,  the  Philippine \nCommission on Women, and other stakeholders of the reforms.34 \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition  to  program  design  and  implementation.  ADB\u2019s  long-term \nengagement and structured policy dialogue with the government, encompassing all three reform \nareas, helped prioritize and strengthen legal, policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms. For \nreform area 1, ADB supported the transition plans needed to prepare national government \nagencies and LGUs for the devolution of public services by 2022. ADB helped to strengthen local \ncapacity to mainstream gender development in planning and budgeting, and to align them with \nnational plans and the SDGs.35 ADB project developed the property tax valuation database and \ntransaction systems and is professionalizing local assessors (footnote 3).36 For reform area 2, \nADB\u2019s technical assistance helped develop the e-learning system and the curriculum to build the \ncore competencies of local treasurers, leading to an increase in the number of treasurers who \npassed the Competency on Local Treasury Examination to 1,403 in 2019 from 577 in 2017.37 For \nreform area 3, ADB\u2019s technical assistance financed by the Urban Climate Change Resilience \nTrust Fund enabled the PPP Center to form a panel of project development consultants to prepare \nlocal PPP projects and ensure project compliance with social and gender safeguards.38 \n \n22.  Development  partner  coordination.  The  government  leads  development  partner \ncoordination in the areas of decentralization and devolution of public services. The Coordinating \nCommittee  on  Decentralization,  chaired  by  the  DILG,  acts  as  secretariat  of  the  Oversight \nCommittee on Devolution, and includes members from government agencies and the leagues of \nlocal governments. The committee invites development partners, including ADB; technical staff \nfrom Congress; and representatives from civil society organizations. ADB closely coordinated with \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement to implement the LGU Resilience Readiness Monitoring \nFramework. ADB had regular dialogue with the governments of Australia and Canada on support \nfor  local  PPP  project  development  and  with  the  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment for local development in Mindanao. ADB liaised with the International Monetary \n \n33 ADB. 2018. Policy-Based Lending 2008\u20132017: Performance, Results, and Issues of Design.

The  program  is  aligned  with  the  Philippines\u2019  overarching  development  objective  of \nenhancing the efficiency, effectiveness, and equity of public service delivery (footnote 16). The \nprogram outcome is improved service delivery ability and local governance performance of \nLGUs.40 One of the program\u2019s three original outcome indicators has been achieved earlier than \nwas envisaged in subprogram 1: As of December 2019, the number of LGUs with improved SGLG \ncertification totaled 442, or 26% of all LGUs, exceeding the original target of 20% by 2024. Hence, \nthe target has been revised upward to at least 50% and advanced to 2022. The program is on \ntrack to achieve the other two original outcome indicators by 2022. Out of all the LGUs, 51.2% \nprepared and submitted GAD plans and budgets for FY2020, close to the original target of 54%; \ntherefore, the target has been upgraded to 70% by FY2022. Finally, the program has contributed \nto increased locally sourced revenues of \u20b1253.7 billion ($5.2 billion) in FY2019, up by 22.6% from \n\u20b1206.9 billion ($4.3 billion) in FY2017. Subprogram 2 includes nine additional outcome indicators \nto measure LGUs\u2019 budget performance, gender responsiveness, and service delivery for each of \nthe three reform areas. The program impact assessment estimates the economic and social \nbenefits at $1.4 billion\u2013$2.5 billion in terms of (i) efficiency gains on local public spending, and  \n(ii) reduced costs of doing business.41 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n24.  The government has requested a regular loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance subprogram 2.42 The loan size is based on the Philippines\u2019 larger \nfinancing needs, reform impacts, and development spending. For 2021, the government\u2019s total \ngross borrowing requirement is estimated to reach a record high at $62.3 billion, a significant \nincrease from $20.1 billion in 2019. Increased borrowing is needed to mitigate the economic \nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to finance the fiscal deficit equivalent to 9.3% of GDP.43 \nThe government plans to raise about $53.3 billion from the issuance of treasury bills and bonds, \n$3.2 billion from official development assistance, and $5.8 billion from external bonds.44 \n \n25.  The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement. Based on the 30% annuity repayment method, the average maturity is \n12.1 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n26.  The DOF is the executing agency for the program. The BLGF, Department of Budget and \nManagement, the DILG, National Economic and Development Authority, and PPP Center are the \n \n39 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n40 The policy design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n41 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n42 The loan amount increased from the indicative $300 million mentioned in the programmatic approach to $400 million, \ngiven the substantial increase in development financing needs.  \n43 Department of Budget and Management. 2020. Budget of Expenditures and Sources of Financing 2021.

The  implementation  period  is  July  2019\u2013June  2021.45 A  steering \ncommittee  chaired  by  the  DOF  oversees  program  implementation.  The  proceeds  of  the \npolicy-based loan will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n27.  Safeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \nis classified category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people\u2019s \nsafeguards. The program is not expected to have any adverse environmental or social safeguard \nimpacts within the meaning of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n28.  Poverty,  social,  and  gender.  Subprogram  2  is  categorized  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. Key reforms focused on mainstreaming gender spanned across all three reform \nareas. These reforms included: (i) gender equality goals integrated into the Executive Order on \nthe Full Devolution of LGU Functions; (ii) local planning and budgeting aligned with the national \nGAD requirement as well as the gender equality SDG (Goal 5); (iii) GAD-PBMS rolled out to \nstrengthen gender mainstreaming in local project development; (iv) GAD monitoring integrated \ninto  the  LIFT  PFM  system;  (v)  SGLG  criteria  upgraded  to  incorporate  GAD;  (vi)  capacity \ndevelopment delivered to local treasurers and budget officers (at least 50% female); (vii) the \nPDMF  augmented  to  target  gender  and  social  safeguards  and  compliance  with  gender-\nresponsive policies and guidelines in local PPP projects; and (viii) gender monitoring integrated \ninto the Rate-My-LGU Service to incentivize LGUs to meet gender-specific needs of citizens. \n \n29.  Governance. The 2016 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment \npointed  to  the  soundness  and  improvement  of  PFM  and  fiduciary  arrangements  of  the \ngovernment, especially policy-based budgeting, transparency, and asset\u2013liability management.46 \nThe government took a strategic view of the 2016 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability \nfindings to improve PFM. The government shifted from an obligation-based to a cash-based \nbudgeting system in 2019. The cash-based budgeting system is based on annual cash payments \nfor contractual obligations in a fiscal year, aiming to incentivize government agencies to be more \nproactive in budget planning and costing, and more timely in procurement and implementation. \nThe government launched the Budget and Treasury Management System in 2019 to integrate all \nessential PFM functions across relevant government agencies into a consolidated database. \nUpon the President\u2019s approval of the National Expenditure Program, the government introduced \nthe  early  procurement  policy,  which  allows  government  agencies  to  undertake  advance \nprocurement activities up to the issuance of the notice of award. This policy helped mitigate delays \nin project implementation associated with delayed procurement. \n \n30.  Risk and mitigating measures. The overall risk for the program is moderate. Major risk \nand mitigating measure are summarized in Table 1 and described in the risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan. \n \nTable 1: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nCOVID-19\u2019s impacts worsen the quality of  The government has stepped up local governance reform as \npublic  service  delivery,  poverty,  and  part of the COVID-19 economic recovery.
