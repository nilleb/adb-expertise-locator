An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nAssessment  undertaken, and the summary IEE is a core appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The Project will provide rural water supply and sanitation facilities \nand services to about 1,000 communities in 20 districts in the \nprovinces of West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, Jambi, and \nBengkulu,  combined  with  capacity  building  for  districts  and \ncommunities,  and  sanitation  and  hygiene  behavioral  change \nprograms. The Project will provide an estimated 1.2 million people \nwith  safe  drinking  water,  of  whom  about  0.6 million  will  also \nbenefit  from  improved  sanitation  facilities.  An  additional  500 \ncommunities  in  Aceh  and  Nias-North  Sumatra  will  be  covered \nthrough  emergency  assistance.  Subproject  selection  at \ncommunity level will combine elements of poverty targeting with a \ndemand-responsive  approach  to  ensure  sustainability  of  the \nfacilities.  \n   \nRationale  Providing access to water and sanitation is an integral part of the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts in improving health and living conditions in \nIndonesia and meeting the related Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). Indonesia has made progress in providing water and \nsanitation  services  to  its  people,  but  standards  remain  below \nthose  for  many  other  Southeast  Asian  countries.  The  great \nmajority of rural and poor households still rely on self-provision \nthrough groundwater abstraction, rainwater collection, or use of \nsurface water, with little government effort to ensure sustainable \nquantity or to monitor water quality. Sanitation in rural areas is \nlimited to simple on-site facilities, and a large percentage of the \nrural population still rely on rivers, beaches, and rice fields for \nopen air defecation. \n  Many rural areas in Indonesia show high levels of waterborne and \nwater-related diseases, including diarrhea, intestinal worms, skin \ndisease, and malaria and dengue. Poor people, and particularly \nchildren, women, and the elderly suffer most from using water \nunfit for human consumption and from poor hygiene practices and \nbehavior. ", "iv \n  The Government has therefore developed a National Policy for \nthe  Development  of  Community-Managed  Water  Supply  and \nEnvironmental Sanitation Facilities and Services, which highlights \nthe need for a demand-responsive approach to rural water supply \nand  sanitation.  In  line  with  this  policy,  the  proposed  Project \naddresses the four major issues that have led to unsatisfactory \nresults of similar past projects: capacity of local governments to \nplan  and  facilitate  sustainable  investments;  ownership  and \ncapacity of communities for implementing and maintaining new \nfacilities;  appropriate  financing  of  investments;  and  need  for \nchange  in  associated  hygiene  behavior,  which  reinforces  the \nhealth impact of investments. \n   \nObjective  The objective of the Project is to enhance the health status of low-\nincome  communities  in  rural  areas  based  on  better  hygiene \nbehavior  and  sustained  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and \nimproved sanitation. The Project aims to (i) improve the capacity \nof  local  governments  for  facilitating,  regulating,  and  delivering \nquality services in water and sanitation to the target communities; \n(ii) strengthen  the  community  capability  to  design,  cofinance, \nbuild, operate, and manage community-based water supply and \nsanitation facilities; (iii) improve access to water and sanitation \nservices  through  construction  of  adequate  facilities  based  on \ncommunity demand; and (iv) increase hygiene awareness through \ninformation, education, and communication campaigns. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  project  cost  excluding  the  grant-financed  emergency \ncomponent  is  $92.4 million  equivalent,  of  which  $12.8 million \n(13.8%) is the foreign exchange cost and $79.6 million equivalent \n(86.2%) is the local currency cost. \n   \nFinancing Plan  Source  Foreign  Local  Total Cost  % \nExchange  Currency \nADB  12.45  52.24  64.69  70.0 \n  OCR  7.98  26.12  34.10  36.9 \n  ADF  4.47  26.12  30.59  33.1 \nGovernment  0.32  21.77  22.09  23.9 \n  Central Govt.a  0.13  11.63  11.76  12.7 \n  District Govts.  0.19  10.14  10.32  11.2 \nBeneficiaries  0.00  5.61  5.61  6.1 \nTotal  12.77  79.62  92.39  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, Govt. = \ngovernment, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \na   Includes provincial governments. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n ", "v \nLoan Amount and Terms  The  Project  will  be  financed  by  two  loans  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  A  loan  of  $34.1 million  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources will be provided under ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will \nhave a 25-year term, including a grace period of 6 years, an \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. \n   \n  Another loan of $30.6 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nwill be provided that will have a maturity of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years. Interest will be charged at 1% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% thereafter.  \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The  total  amount  of  $64.7 million  provided  by  ADB  will  cover \nTerms  97.5% of the foreign exchange cost (70.0% of total project cost) \nand 65.6% of the local currency cost. The Government and the \nbeneficiaries will provide the remaining $27.7 million equivalent, \namounting to 30.0% of the total project cost. \n \nThe Government will forward the loan proceeds as grants to local \ngovernments participating in the Project, taking into account the \nfact that the Project will directly benefit the poor and will focus on \nessential  water,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  services  that  do  not \ngenerate revenues. Participating local governments will contribute \nto  the  project  cost  in  accordance  with  their  fiscal  capacity. \nBeneficiaries will contribute in cash and in kind to the financing of \nconstruction  costs,  and  will  shoulder  all  operation  and \nmaintenance costs. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2011 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2011 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Directorate General of Communicable Disease Control and \nEnvironmental  Health  of  the  Ministry  of  Health  will  be  the \nExecuting Agency for the Project. \n   \nImplementation  A central project management unit (CPMU) will be established at \nArrangements  the Directorate General of Communicable Disease Control and \nEnvironmental Health. An interministerial steering committee will \nprovide  overall  guidance  to  the  Project  and  make  policy  and \nstrategic decisions. Provincial coordinating committees will assist \ndistrict  coordinating  teams  regarding  issues  that  cross  district \nboundaries. Each participating district will set up a district project \nmanagement  unit.  Participating  communities  will  set  up \ncommunity implementation teams responsible for project-related \ncommunity activities. Consulting services will provide support at \nthe central, provincial, district, subdistrict, and village levels. \n   ", "vi \nProcurement  Goods and services financed by the ADB loans will be procured in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s procurement procedures acceptable to ADB. It is \nanticipated  that  there  will  be  no  procurement  by  international \ncompetitive bidding. Equipment and material packages valued at \n$500,000  equivalent  or  less  will  be  procured  following \ninternational  shopping  procedures.  Certain  items  valued  at \n$200,000 or less may be procured under local competitive bidding \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Packages  valued  at  $50,000 \nequivalent  or  less  will  be  procured  under  direct  purchasing \nprocedures. Civil works contracts will be small, with an average \nvalue  of  $10,000\u201430,000  equivalent  and  will  follow  the \nprocedures for community participation in procurement as outlined \nin ADB\u2019s Guide on Community Participation in Procurement. \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will finance 538 person-months of consulting services \nto support the CPMU (78 person-months international and 460 \ndomestic), and 6,256 person-months of domestic consultants at \nthe  provincial  and  district  levels.  Suitable  local  community \nfacilitators  will  be  contracted  individually  and/or  from \nnongovernment  organizations  to  assist  the  community \nimplementation  teams.  Consultants  and  nongovernment \norganizations  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants, using a quality and cost-\nbased selection method and other arrangements satisfactory to \nADB for engaging domestic consultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The main benefits of the Project will be (i) reduced poverty and \nBeneficiaries  increased  health  benefits  in  poor  districts;  (ii) increased \ncommunity empowerment; and (iii) strengthened local government \ncapacity. \n \n  Reliable access to safe water and sanitation facilities will save \ntime and effort required to obtain good quality water, increasing \ntime and capacity for income-generating activities. Better quality \nwater and improved hygiene behavior will reduce the incidence \nand  severity  of  waterborne  and  water-related  diseases, \nparticularly among infants, young children, and the elderly, leading \nto a reduction in sick days and health-related expenditures. This \nwill  improve  levels  of  social  welfare,  and  facilitate  efforts  to \nimprove the economic welfare of beneficiaries. Given the high \nproportion  of  poor  households  in  the  target  districts,  and  the \nproposed targeting on the poorest locations within these districts, \nthe incidence of poverty among project beneficiaries is expected \nto be well over 50%. \n ", "vii \n  The Project will have a positive impact on communities\u2019 ownership \nand  leadership  in  their  development,  as  they  will  actively \nparticipate  in  selecting,  planning,  cofinancing,  implementing, \noperating, and maintaining the investments. The performance of \nlocal governments will be improved by introducing a simplified \nquality management approach to public administration, which will \nhelp improve service delivery as well as transparency of the local \nadministration. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  assumes  (i) a  stable  political  environment  and  a \ncontinuation  of  the  decentralization  and  regional  autonomy \npolicies  currently  in  place;  (ii) full  participation  of  government \nagencies  in  capacity  building  and  application  of  a  community-\ndriven  approach;  and  (iii) effective  community  facilitation  and \ncommunity participation and ownership. \n   \nEmergency Assistance  An  emergency  assistance  grant  totaling  $16.5  million  will  be \nGrant  provided to help restore and improve access to water supply and \nsanitation facilities for the rural population in Aceh and Nias-North \nSumatra  affected  by  the  tsunami  disaster.

RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  In December 2002, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a project preparatory \nassistance (PPTA) for the Community Water Services and Health Project.2 The PPTA started in \nJune 2003 and was completed in May 2004. The Government, represented by the Directorate \nGeneral of Communicable Disease Control and Environmental Health of the Ministry of Health \n(MOH), agreed to a decentralized investment project in line with Indonesia\u2019s strategies and \npolicies for the rural water supply and sanitation sector. The Project has been designed to cover \nfour provinces. A small-scale technical assistance was approved in February 2004 for the \npreparation of additional subprojects to increase the number of districts covered under the \nProject in these provinces from 12 to 20.3 \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Providing access to clean water and sanitation is seen as an integral part of overall \nefforts  to  improve  health  conditions  in  Indonesia.4  The  Government  is  firmly  committed  to \nmeeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), including the target of reducing by half the \nproportion of people without access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 (MDG 7, \nTarget 10). \n \n4.  Indonesia has made progress in providing clean water and basic sanitation services to \nits people, but standards remain below those of many other ADB developing member countries \n(DMCs). According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), about 55% of the \nIndonesian population had access to improved sanitation and 78% to an improved source of \ndrinking water in 2000.5 These percentages were higher than in some of the poorest countries in \nthe region such as Cambodia and the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), but below \nthose for other Southeast Asian countries such as the Philippines and Thailand (Appendix 2, \nTable A2.1). Following the economic crisis in 1997\u201398, access to water and sanitation has \nexperienced little progress, as new investments have been largely postponed and existing \nsystems have deteriorated due to inadequate maintenance and repair.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The Project framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  ADB. 2002.

Manila (TA 4317-\nINO, for $150,000). \n4  The Healthy Indonesia 2010 policy document prepared by the Ministry of Health sets out the Government\u2019s \nnational health development program to achieve the health-related MDGs. \n5  UNDP. 2003. Human Development Report 2003. New York. Improved sanitation is defined as access to adequate \nexcreta disposal facilities, such as a connection to a sewer or septic tank system, a pour-flush latrine, a simple pit \nlatrine, or a ventilated improved pit latrine. Improved water is defined as reasonable access (20 liters per person \nper day within 1 kilometer distance) to household connections, public standpipes, boreholes, protected dug wells, \nprotected springs, or rainwater collection.  ", "2 \n5.  According to the 2002 National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS) only about 15% of \nrural  households  and  just  13%  of  households  in  the  lowest  expenditure  quintile  obtained \ndrinking water from pipe or pump (borehole) sources. The great majority of rural and poor \nhouseholds  still  rely  on  self-provision  through  shallow  groundwater  abstraction,  rainwater \ncollection, or use of surface water from nearby rivers or springs.6 Ensuring sustainable quantity \nor monitoring water quality remains a problem. The majority of households in Indonesia use on-\nsite facilities for sanitation as access to sewerage is restricted to partial coverage in a few urban \ncenters7 and is virtually nonexistent in peri-urban and rural areas. In rural areas only about 27% \nof households claimed to regularly use toilet facilities, and only 21% septic tanks for final \ndisposal of human waste. As with water, the number of people with lack of access to adequate \nsanitation is much higher among the poor (Appendix 2, Table A2.2). \n \n6.  Many rural and peri-urban areas in Indonesia have priority disease profiles that include \ndiarrhea, intestinal worms,8 skin disease, and other water-related diseases such as malaria and \ndengue. Poor people in remote rural areas, and particularly children, women, and the elderly \namong them are more affected than others. While infant mortality rates under 5 have decreased \nsubstantially over the past decades, from 145 per 1,000 live births in 1967 to 35 in 2000, they \nare  still  above  those  of  other  Southeast  Asian  countries  such  as  Thailand  (25)  and  the \nPhilippines (30). Diarrhea remains the second largest cause of death among young children, \nand is the main reason why children get stunted, particularly at 12\u201324 months of age. The \nsituation  results  from  inadequate  levels  of  access  to  clean  water  supply  and  sanitation, \ncombined with poor hygiene practices and behavior, such as disposal of human waste in rivers. \nThere is an increasing recognition of the need to integrate changes in hygiene behavior into \nwater and sanitation programs in order to increase the sustainability of the investments made.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  Most water supply development in Indonesia has traditionally been directed toward cities \nand towns under the Ministry of Public Works (MPW).9 Regional water supply enterprises \n(PDAM) are in charge of operating and maintaining piped water supply networks in urban areas, \nthough their performance over the last two decades has been largely inadequate in terms of \nfinancial sustainability and increasing coverage.  \n \n8.  Rural water supply development over the past decades has essentially been undertaken \nby MOH, assisted by multilateral and bilateral funding agencies, and focusing on traditional \nsources such as wells and rivers. While service coverage figures indicate a significant increase \nsince the 1980s, many facilities do not function properly and were quickly abandoned because \ncommunities were unable to operate and maintain them. \n \n9.  Both MPW and MOH have taken on some responsibility for sanitation, but neither one is \npresently in the position to lead a national effort toward reaching the sanitation-related target of \nthe MDG. MPW has installed a large number of public communal bathing, washing, and toilet \nfacilities  in  subdistrict  towns  and  rural  areas.  However,  these  facilities  have  been  largely \nunsuccessful  in  achieving  the  intended  outcomes  due  to  a  lack  of  management  and \nmaintenance support either from local authorities or from intended beneficiaries. \n                                                 \n6  The 2002 SUSENAS gave the following for rural households: container (0.3%), pipe (6.2%), pump (9.0%), \nprotected well (36.9%), protected spring (12.1%), unprotected well (17.8%), unprotected spring (7.9%), river \n(5.5%), rainwater (3.9%), other (0.4%). \n7  Only seven cities have a sewerage network, which covers only parts of these cities. \n8  Such as ascariasis, dracunculiasis, hookworm, tapeworm, threadworm, and whipworm. \n9  Formerly the Ministry of Settlements and Regional Development. \n ", "3 \n10.  Based on these experiences and in line with the decentralization and regional autonomy \npolicies,  the  Government  in  2002  developed  a  National  Policy  for  the  Development  of \nCommunity-Managed Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation Facilities and Services.10 The \npolicy, which is to be issued as a decree, introduces a paradigm change toward a demand-\nresponsive  approach  for  water  and  sanitation  facilities  and  services,  and  advocates  a \nstrengthening of local government11 and community12 capacities in the provision of water supply \nand  sanitation  services,  together  with  sanitation  and  hygiene  behavioral  change  (SHBC) \nprograms in the communities. \n \n11.  With  decentralization,  local  governments  became  responsible  for  delivering  basic \nservices to their communities. However, many of them have very limited capacities and require \nsupport to facilitate and finance necessary investments. Similarly, communities need support for \nplanning,  implementing,  operating,  and  maintaining  improved  water  supply  and  sanitation \nfacilities. Numerous studies and projects in and outside Indonesia have demonstrated that the \ninvolvement  of  the  community  in  the  decision-making,  implementation,  and  maintenance \nprocess correlates positively with the sustainability of improved services. \n \n12.  In the past, the lack of attention on SHBC has led to inconsistent use of the facilities \nprovided, reducing the positive impact of the improvements on the communities\u2019 health. Recent \n\u201cnew generation\u201d projects such as the ongoing World Bank Second Water and Sanitation for \nLow Income Communities Project (WSLIC-II)13 and the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation \nProject for Nusa Tenggara Timur (ProAir)14 combine hygiene and prevention of waterborne \ncommunicable  diseases,  improved  water  services,  and  sustainability  of  services  through \ncommunity participation.15  \n \n13.  Key lessons learned from demand-driven, community-based, rural water supply and \nsanitation  projects  in  Indonesia  and  other  Asian  countries  focus  on  the  importance  of \n(i) manageable geographic coverage of a project; (ii) a simple water and sanitation technology \nmenu for communities to chose from; (iii) the engagement of communities in the whole project \ncycle;  (iv) an  extensive  use  of  community  facilitators;  (v) community  contributions  for \nconstruction,  and  full  responsibility  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs;  (vi) more \nemphasis on hygiene behavioral change programs; and (vii) close monitoring of construction \nquality and transparent project administration and procurement procedures.16 In line with the \nGovernment\u2019s  policy,  the  proposed  Project  addresses  the  four  major  issues  behind  the \nweakness  of  similar  past  projects:  capacity  of  local  governments  to  plan  and  facilitate \nsustainable  investments;  ownership  and  capacity  of  communities  in  implementing  and \nmaintaining  investments;  appropriate  financing  of  investments;  and  need  for  change  in \nassociated  hygiene  behavior,  which  capitalizes  on  investments  and  reinforces  their  health \nimpact.

", "4 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n14.  The goal of the Project is to improve the health status and quality of life of the population \nof Indonesia in line with the MDG targets on safe water supply and sanitation. The purpose of \nthe Project is to provide sustained access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation, and to \nimprove the hygiene behavior of low-income communities in rural and peri-urban areas. The \nProject will improve district government capacity to facilitate and regulate basic water and \nsanitation  services;  empower  communities  to  take  responsibility  for  developing  and \nimplementing  such  services  based  on  a  demand-driven,  community-based  approach;  and \nincrease awareness about appropriate healthy and hygienic behavior. The Project will cover \nabout 1,000 communities in 20 districts in four provinces: West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, \nJambi, and Bengkulu. Selection of provinces and districts is based on a transparent process of \nprioritization and selection criteria agreed upon between the Government, ADB, and major \nstakeholders.  All  districts  have  prepared  subproject  appraisal  reports  in  accordance  with \nMinistry of Finance decree No. 35/2003 (KMK 35).17 In addition, in light of the earthquake and \ntsunami tidal waves that hit Indonesia and in particular the provinces of Aceh and Nias-North \nSumatra on 26 December 2004, and based on the Memorandum of Understanding between the \nGovernment of Indonesia and ADB dated 5 January 2005, the Project will also include an \nemergency assistance grant for these provinces, covering about five districts and approximately \n500 communities. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n15.  The Project consists of four components: (i) District and Subdistrict Capacity Building, \n(ii) Community Empowerment, (iii) Community-based Water Supply and Sanitation Facilities, \nand (iv) Sanitation and Hygiene Behavioral Change. \n \n1.  District and Subdistrict Capacity Building \n16.  Component 1 will improve local government capacity for facilitating, regulating, and\u2014\nwhere necessary\u2014delivering quality services in water, sanitation, and health to the targeted \ncommunities.  A  simplified  quality  management  approach  will  be  used  to  help  catalyze \ndevelopment activities that go beyond the activities directly related to the Project. To participate \nin the Project, districts will have to show commitment to reform that includes self-assessment of \ntheir  service  capacity;  identification,  formulation,  and  implementation  of  priority  quality \nmanagement projects; good governance; and a dedication to evaluate and learn from results. \n \n17.  Existing training and education facilities at the provincial and district level will be used \nwherever appropriate. District governments will be assisted in establishing their own human \nresource development plan. Training modules will include strategic and leadership issues, such \nas management by objectives and community-driven development; technical issues such as \nquality  assurance  for  laboratories,  basics  of  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation,  and  water \ntreatment; and computer skills. Capacity building on advocacy will also be provided to members \nof the local legislative assemblies to facilitate informed decisions about water supply, sanitation, \nand health-related investments. \n                                                 \n17 A summary description of four pilot subproject appraisal reports is in Supplementary Appendix D. Executive \nsummaries  of  all  20  subproject  appraisal  reports  are  also  in  Appendix  18  of  the  Project  Administration \nMemorandum.  \n ", "5 \n2.  Community Empowerment \n18.  Efforts to strengthen the capacities of rural people are by definition community-based. \nThe second component will strengthen community capabilities to develop, cofinance, build, \noperate, and maintain community-based water supply and sanitation facilities. The Project will \nfocus on (i) advocacy and awareness-raising regarding community water supply, sanitation, and \nhygiene in target villages; (ii) formal confirmation of a village\u2019s commitment to participate in the \nProject,  and  the  approval  of  the  respective  districts;  (iii) formation  of  a  community \nimplementation  team  (CIT)18  with  members  drawn  from  community  stakeholders  in  a \ntransparent and inclusive manner; (iv) conducting village problem mapping to determine issues \nand  possible  solutions;  (v) formulation  of  a  community  action  plan  (CAP),  which  will  be  a \ndetailed plan on how to address the identified water supply, sanitation, and health problems at \nan appropriate level of technology and a reasonable budget level; (vi) signing of a project-\nrelated contract between communities and districts; and (vii) organizing community groups and \nmembers to implement and monitor water supply and sanitation improvements, and sanitation \nand hygiene behavioral change programs.  \n \n19.  Local  community  facilitators  will  be  either  individuals  or  representatives  of \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and will carry out, and assist communities, in these \nproject activities. They will focus on genuine empowerment of villagers to direct their own \ndevelopment by addressing their lack of information, education, skills, and physical well-being. \nCommunity  facilitators  will  undergo  an  initial  3-month  training  course  to  (i) improve  their \nmanagement and interpersonal skills as facilitators; (ii) provide them with sufficient technical \nunderstanding  of  water,  sanitation,  and  related  hygiene  issues;  (iii) train  them  in  poverty \nanalysis and targeting, and a variety of participatory techniques; and (iv) help them successfully \nassist communities with day-to-day issues they encounter during project implementation, in \nparticular related to O&M. Refresher courses will be given periodically to meet specific needs \nthat will be identified as the Project progresses. Community facilitators who have successfully \ncompleted training will be assigned in teams of three, consisting of one community mobilization \nfacilitator, one water supply and sanitation engineer, and one sanitation and hygiene promotion \nspecialist. At least one out of the three team members will be female. Each team will cover five \nvillages on average per year, depending on the size, remoteness, and geographic spread of the \nvillages. Productivity and effectiveness of the community facilitators will be closely monitored, \nand nonperforming facilitators will be replaced.19 \n \n3.  Community\u2013Based Water Supply and Sanitation Facilities \n20.  The Project will finance the construction of water supply and sanitation schemes in \napproximately  1,000  communities,  including  the  rehabilitation  of  existing  facilities  where \nfeasible. The main technical options for water supply schemes under the Project are (i) gravity \npipe  systems  from  spring,  (ii) gravity  pipe  systems  from  spring  with  booster  pumping, \n(iii) pumping  from  a  river  with  slow  sand  treatment  and  chlorination,  (iv) deep  wells  and \nboreholes with pumps and public standpipes, (v) medium-depth boreholes with small pumps \nand storage tanks, (vi) dug wells, (vii) hand-pump wells, (viii) rainwater harvesting units, and \n(ix) simple water treatment units.  \n \n                                                 \n18 The CIT will act as the management committee described in ADB\u2019s Guide on Community Participation in \nProcurement, and will be responsible for entering into a contract with the DPMU. It will be composed of a water \nservices unit, a hygiene and sanitation unit, and a finance and administration unit. \n19 The decision to replace a facilitator will be based on well-defined criteria and will be taken jointly by the consultant \nemploying the facilitator, the DPMU, and the provincial project secretariat. ", "6 \n21.  The main options for sanitation are (i) ventilated improved pit latrines, (ii) pour-flush \ntoilets, and (iii) pour-flush toilets with septic tanks. The Project will support the development of \nsanitation  facilities  by  providing  a  subsidy  for  latrine  construction  for  the  poorest  10%  of \nhouseholds  per  village.  The  Project  will  also  finance  the  development  of simple  drainage, \nwashing platforms, soak pits, and bathing and washing steps along rivers and canals.  \n \n22.  With the assistance and advice from community facilitators, communities will choose \nfrom  the  above  menu  the  feasible  technical  option(s)  that  they  consider  to  be  the  most \nappropriate  based  on  information  provided  regarding  technology;  raw  water  source; \nenvironmental, social, and institutional/management issues; and O&M costs. Technical manuals \nand guidelines prepared by MOH, MPW, and similar previous projects20 will be adapted for the \nProject by the Executing Agency (EA). For these investments, communities will receive funds \nwith a maximum ceiling of Rp250 million (about Rp220 million for water supply facilities and \nRp30 million  for  community  health  and  sanitation  facilities)  per  village.21  Communities  will \ncontribute in cash and in kind at least 20% of construction costs, and will be responsible for all \nO&M costs. Household surveys undertaken during the PPTA and similar recent projects such as \nWSLIC-II suggest that the average willingness and capability to pay on a monthly basis are \nsufficient to finance O&M costs of most technical options.  \n \n4.  Sanitation and Hygiene Behavioral Change \n23.  This  component  will  promote  SHBC  to  maximize  the  health  impact  of  project \ninvestments in water supply and sanitation, and to reduce the incidence of waterborne and \nwater-related diseases in the project area through improved practices. The Project will adopt the \nhygiene improvement framework,22 use the methodology for participatory assessment (MPA)23 \nand participatory hygiene and sanitation transformation (PHAST)24 techniques, and build on the \nBasic Sanitation Package developed by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund.25 Activities focus \non (i) a school health and sanitation program, (ii) hygiene promotion at religious facilities, (iii) a \ncommunity hygiene program, and (iv) a home water treatment and storage program.  \n \n24.  Activities will be designed for specific target groups\u2014women, mothers of young children, \nboys and girls of school age, out-of-school children\u2014applying a user-friendly approach that \ntakes into account issues of gender as well as the culture and language of indigenous peoples. \nWhere  appropriate,  the  component  will  adopt  existing  materials  from  Indonesia  and  other \ncountries and create links to ongoing activities of other organizations. Implementation of these \nactivities will precede, run in parallel, and follow up on the construction of water supply and \nsanitation facilities to ensure maximum benefits.  \n \n                                                 \n20 For example, MPW\u2019s 2003 Guide to Prepare Design and Construction for Water Supply and Sanitation Facilities for \nVillages; and WSLIC-II\u2019s Guide to Construction of Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Facilities. \n21 CAPs requesting larger amounts can be considered if adequate technical and financial justification is provided, and \nwill require ADB approval. \n22 The hygiene improvement framework is an integrated approach that combines expanded access to hardware with \nhygiene promotion and support to an enabling institutional framework to reduce diarrheal disease. \n23 Developed in 1998 by the Water and Sanitation Program and the International Water and Sanitation Centre. \n24 PHAST tools developed by the World Bank involve six steps: problem identification, problem analysis, planning for \nsolutions, selecting options, planning for new facilities and behavioral change, and participatory monitoring and \nevaluation. \n25 The basic sanitation package provides implementation guidelines for community sanitation and hygiene awareness \nprograms to increase knowledge and improve facilities and practices of the population. It will be adapted for the \nProject to be compatible with the participatory planning and M&E process set out in component 2. \n ", "7 \nC.  Special Features \n25.  Community-Driven Participatory Approach. The Project relies on a community-driven \nparticipatory approach. Communities decide on the type of technology to be used, plan and \nimplement the activity with the assistance of community facilitators, take charge of O&M on a \npermanent basis, and monitor and evaluate the sustainability and use of the new services. \nCommunities are required to demonstrate their commitment by contributing at least 20% of the \ntotal capital cost (16% in kind, 4% in cash) of the investment in water supply and sanitation \nfacility  construction,  and  by  covering  all  O&M  costs.  The  Project  will  provide  training  to \nbeneficiaries in design and construction, financial management, and O&M,  which will help \nensure sustainability of the newly constructed facilities, and provide communities with skills to \ninitiate other community activities and improvements. Since civil works contracts will be mostly \nsmall,  community-based  contracting  will  be  allowed  following  ADB\u2019s  Guide  on  Community \nParticipation  in  Procurement.26  Direct  fund  channeling  of  community  funds  has  proven  to \nsubstantially speed up the flow of funds to the ultimate beneficiaries for community-based civil \nworks contracting. The fund-flow mechanism is outlined in Appendix 5. \n \n26.  Selecting  Project  Locations  and  Targeting  Beneficiaries.  Provinces  and  districts \nwere selected using a screening process based on financial capacity, poverty incidence, health \nconditions,  water  and  sanitation  conditions,  and  political  commitment  to  civil  society \ninvolvement, transparent project management, and stakeholder participation\u2014in line with ADB\u2019s \npolicies on governance. Within target districts a similar approach has been applied to define a \nlong-list of villages in each district (Appendix 6). Community facilitators will be sensitized to \nconcerns related to poverty, gender, and indigenous social or cultural issues27 to maximize the \nparticipation of women, poor households, and other marginal groups. The CAPs will need to \ndemonstrate how the views of all segments of the community have been incorporated. \n \n27.  Gender Focus. A summary gender action plan (GAP) is attached in Appendix 8. The \nkey strategies underlining the GAP include: (i) active involvement of women as implementors \nand beneficiaries during community consultations, workshops, and focus group discussions, \nfocusing on the participation of poor women, female household heads, and mothers with infants \nand young school children; (ii) engagement of women organizations, teachers, village midwives, \nhealth volunteers, and other women activists, for information, education, and communication \n(IEC) campaigns; (iii) engagement of at least one female community facilitator per team to \nattract women\u2019s active participation in IEC campaigns and the implementation of behavioral \nchange; (iv) adequate representation of women on the CIT to ensure that CAPs adequately \nreflect women\u2019s interests; and (v) specific training activities for village women.  \n \n28.  Transparency  and  Accountability.  Implementation  arrangements  will  enhance \ntransparency of project operations; increase accountability, quality control and assurance; and \nminimize the risk of funds diversion in the areas of (i) procurement of consulting services, goods \nand  materials,  and  civil  works;  (ii) construction  supervision  and  quality  control;  and \n(iii) monitoring and evaluation (M&E).28 Methods to improve consultant procurement procedures \nwill include training of procurement committee members, pre-bid conferences, external reviews \n                                                 \n26 See Appendix 2 of ADB Project Administration Instructions No. 3.05 and the Project Administration Memorandum \nfor details. \n27 An indigenous peoples development framework has been prepared and is in Appendix 7. \n28 Details are in the Project Administration Memorandum. Recommendations of the Final Report of advisory technical \nassistance (ADTA) 3842-INO (ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Strengthening the \nCapacity of Ministry of Settlements and Regional Infrastructure to Combat Fraud and Corruption. Manila) were \ntaken into account. ", "8 \nof proposals, and thorough reference checking on consultant candidates as part of the proposal \nreview. For goods and services, a unit cost study will be carried out at the start and updated \nregularly  to  ensure  cost-effective  and  market-based  construction  budgets.  All  construction \ncontracts will be publicly displayed in the communities, as will construction budgets, engineering \ndesigns, work schedules, and required and actual community contributions, with grievance \nmechanisms in place. As regards M&E, community members and their facilitators will receive \nM&E training during the CAP planning phase to enable them to judge the quality of consultants \nand of construction. Process monitoring consultants (PMCs) will be placed at the district level to \nmonitor and address implementation problems and to carry out post-construction technical \naudits focusing on quality and cost-effectiveness of the infrastructure in each community. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n29.  The total cost of the Project is estimated to be $92.4 million equivalent, comprising \n$12.8 million (13.8%) in foreign exchange cost and $79.6 million (86.2%) equivalent in local \ncurrency cost. The cost estimates include the provision of $7.3 million in taxes and duties and \n5% of base costs for physical contingencies of some activities.

The Government has requested that ADB provide funding of $64.7 million, representing \n70%  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  Borrower  will  be  the  Republic  of  Indonesia.  A  loan  of \n$34.1 million will be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR) and a loan of \n$30.6 million from ADB\u2019s Asian Development Fund (ADF) Special Funds resources. The OCR \nloan will have a term of 25 years with a grace period of 6 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per \nannum, conversion options that may be exercised in accordance with ADB\u2019s loan regulations \nand conversion guidelines, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the Loan and \nProject Agreements. The ADF loan will have a term of 32 years with a grace period of 8 years. \nInterest rate charge on the ADF funds is 1% during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. \n \n31.  ADB will cover 97.5% of the foreign exchange cost of the Project and 65.6% of the local \ncurrency cost, excluding taxes. The Government and the beneficiaries will provide $22.1 million \nand $5.6 million equivalent, amounting to 23.9% and 6.1% of the project cost, respectively. The \nfinancing of local currency costs by ADB is justified by the nature of the Project, which will \naddress regional poverty, gender concerns, and environmental health issues in the project \nareas, as well as assist in achieving the water- and sanitation-related MDGs. ADB funding will \ncover the construction of village water supply and sanitation systems, health and hygiene \nawareness  campaigns,  training  for  local  government  staff  and  community  members,  and \nconsulting services.

", "10 \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \na.  Central Level \n32.  The Directorate General of Communicable Disease Control and Environmental Health of \nMOH will be the EA. A central project management unit (CPMU) will be established at the EA. A \nsteering committee, chaired by the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) and \nincluding  representatives  from  MOH,  MPW,  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs, \nMinistry of Environment, and Ministry of National Education, will provide guidance to the Project \nand make policy and strategic decisions. The organization chart is in Appendix 10. \n \n33.  The CPMU will be responsible for (i) project management, monitoring, and supervision, \nand  liaison  with  other  ministries  and  ADB;  (ii) preparing  and  managing  the  annual  project \nbudget; (iii) assisting the Borrower in the competitive procurement of consulting services for the \ncentral support team (CST), provincial support teams (PSTs), district support teams (DSTs), \ncommunity  facilitator  teams  (CFTs),  and  individual  consultants;  (iv) establishing  detailed \nimplementation  guidelines  for  administration,  technical  support,  and  institutional  capacity \nstrengthening;  (v) disseminating  information  to  local  government  agencies,  institutions,  and \ncommunities involved in the Project; (vi) undertaking M&E activities; (vii) submitting periodic \nproject progress and financial reports; and (ix) ensuring implementation of the GAP. The CPMU \nwill  be  fully  assisted  by  the  CST  consisting  of  international  and  national  consultants  with \nexpertise in project management, finance and accounting, contract management, SHBC, rural \nwater supply and sanitation, institutional capacity building, water quality monitoring, and quality \nassurance. The CST will be physically located within the CPMU. \n \nb.  Province Level \n34.  A provincial coordination committee appointed by the Governor and chaired by the \nprovincial development planning agency (BAPPEDA) will support the district coordinating teams \nand resolve cross-jurisdictional issues among districts. A project secretariat will be established \nto act as the main contact at the provincial level for the CPMU, to receive instructions from the \nCPMU, and to pass them on to the coordinating committee and appropriate agencies. A three-\nperson PST in each of the four provinces consisting of specialists in administration, finance, and \nmonitoring; water and sanitation engineering; and institutional capacity building will provide \nsupport to the district- and community-level consultants. \n \nc.  District and Subdistrict Level \n35.  In  each  participating  district,  a  district  project  management  unit  (DPMU)  will  be \nestablished, headed by the head of the district health office and staffed with members from the \nparticipating agencies (Health Office, Public Works Office, Community Empowerment Office, \nEnvironmental Office, and Education Office). Its main responsibilities will be to (i) manage all \nproject-related activities at the district level and below; (ii) monitor and evaluate project activities \nto assure quality of project outputs, and ensure that monitoring data are properly collected and \npassed to the CPMU on schedule; (iii) work closely with the consultant teams at the provincial, \ndistrict, and community levels to ensure that required services are provided in a timely and \nprofessional  manner  to  communities  participating  in  the  Project;  (iv) process  and  sign  the \ncontract  with  individual  communities  for  the  release  of  village  funds;  and  (v) act  as  the \nsecretariat of the district coordinating team. \n ", "11 \n36.  The district coordinating teams will be the same that were appointed during subproject \nappraisal reports preparation by the district head, chaired by BAPPEDA, and consist of district \ngovernment  representatives  from  the  Health  Office,  Public  Works  Office,  Community \nEmpowerment Office/Village Community Development Office, Education Office, Environmental \nOffice, and community representatives. The district coordinating team will provide guidance to \nthe DPMU and consultants at the district and village levels, and liaise with the CPMU. \n \n37.  In each participating district there will be a DST that will provide support to the DPMU \nand  to  the  CFTs  working  with  participating  communities.  The  DST  will  consist  of  three \nspecialists  in  community  empowerment,  water  and  sanitation  engineering,  and  SHBC  and \ntraining.  In  addition,  there  will  be  one  PMC  in  each  district  to  monitor  and  address \nimplementation problems at the district level and below. \n \n38.  Cross-sector coordination teams will also be set up at the subdistrict level to support \ncoordination among villages. The composition of these teams will mirror that of the district \ncoordination teams and will include the head of subdistrict and representatives of the community \nhealth centers. Community health centers will be involved in particular in the SHBC activities, \ngiven the fact that they are already offering advisory services on sanitation in the context of \nMOH\u2019s sanitation clinic program. \n \nd.  Community Level \n39.  In each participating community, a CIT will be established and will be responsible for \nensuring the full involvement of the community in all project-related planning, training, choice of \nfacilities and services, cofinancing, design and construction, SHBC, and O&M. Women will be \nadequately represented on the CITs. \n \n40.  The CITs will be supported by CFTs working at subdistrict and village level. CFTs with \nexpertise in community mobilization, rural water supply and sanitation engineering, and SHBC \nand training, will be recruited either in an individual capacity or as representatives of NGOs. \nCFTs will be mobilized after receiving intensive training as described in para. 19. Approximately \n40 CFTs will be hired to provide support to the selected 20 districts. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n41.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years. Communities will be grouped into four \nbatches, with the first batch having about 40 communities. Community-level activities will be \nimplemented  in  2-year  cycles  consisting  of  information  and  socialization  of  the  Project; \nestablishment of the CIT; preparation of the CAP; and construction and complementary training \nin O&M, M&E, and SHBC. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 11. \n3.  Procurement \n42.  All procurement of goods and services financed under the Project will be carried out in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  the  Government\u2019s  procurement \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. It is expected that international competitive bidding will not be \nrequired  due  to  the  small  size  of  contracts.  Equipment  and  material  packages  valued  at \n$500,000  equivalent  or  less  will  be  procured  following  international  shopping  procedures. \nCertain  items  costing  the  equivalent  or  less  than  $200,000  may  be  procured  under  local \ncompetitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. Packages valued at $50,000 equivalent or \nless will be procured under direct purchasing procedures. Civil works contracts will be small, ", "12 \nwith an average value of $10,000\u201330,000 equivalent, and will follow community participation in \nprocurement in ADB\u2019s Guide on Community Participation in Procurement. The first two of these \ncivil works contracts in each province will be subject to ADB approval. Subsequently, the DPMU \nwill maintain specified documents29 for review by ADB. The proposed procurement packages \nare listed in Appendix 12. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n43.  Consulting  services  will  comprise  538  person-months  of  long-term  and  intermittent \nconsultants to support the CPMU (78 person-months international and 460 person-months \ndomestic), and 6,256 person-months of domestic consultants for the PSTs, DSTs, and PMCs. \nThe PSTs will subcontract suitable individuals and/or NGOs30 as CFTs to assist the CITs in the \nplanning, implementation, and monitoring of their CAPs. The CST will consist of one consulting \npackage. There will be four regional consultant packages, one per province, including four \nPSTs, 20 DSTs, and 40 CFTs. The four packages will be contracted at the provincial level, with \nmembers of the central Government on the selection committee and with assistance from the \nCST. All consultants to be financed under the loans will be recruited as firms or individuals in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, using the quality and cost-based \nselection method or other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \nDetailed terms of reference are in Appendix 13. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n44.  Disbursement arrangements will ensure that funds reach the intended beneficiaries (i.e., \nthe communities and district governments) in an efficient and effective manner, in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. It is envisaged that the direct payment and the \nimprest account procedures will be used. Imprest accounts will be established for both loans in \nBank  Indonesia,  with  an  initial  combined  advance  ceiling  of  $2.3 million.31  Liquidation  and \nreplenishment of the imprest accounts will be based on the actual releases to the village \ncontractors and suppliers, and individual village members. Disbursement arrangements are as \nfollows: \n(i)  For CPMU, provincial secretariat and DPMU activities, the direct payment and \nthe  imprest  account  procedures  will  be  used,  the  latter  with  a  statement  of \nexpenditures limit of $50,000 to cover small expenditures; the CPMU will review \nand certify all direct payment and statement of expenditure claims to be financed \nby ADB; and \n(ii)  For village-level investments, the Government will utilize the imprest accounts as \npass-through accounts to make payments directly to individual bank accounts \nheld by the CITs. The latter will be highlighted in the withdrawal applications. \nThese community funds will have a maximum ceiling of Rp250 million (about \nRp220 million for water supply facilities and Rp30 million for community health \nand  sanitation  facilities)  per  village.  Disbursement  will  be  subject  to  the \nestablishment of a CIT, an approved CAP, a signed contract between the CIT \nand the DPMU, and deposit of the community\u2019s cash contribution in the CIT bank \n                                                 \n29 These  include  the  CAP,  bid  invitation  letters,  bid  opening  statements,  bid  evaluation  reports  or  approval \ndocuments, and signed contracts between the CIT and the contractors, where applicable. \n30 Selection criteria will include province/district origin or at least presence, and evidence of a track record in \ncommunity-based projects. \n31 Based on the average number of villages with approved CAPs per 6-month period at Rp250 million per village. The \ninitial imprest account advance for the OCR loan will be $1.1 million and for the ADF loan $1.2 million. \n ", "13 \naccount. Funds will be released in tranches of 30%, 40%, and 30%, based on \nverification of actual implementation progress by the DPMUs and the PMCs. \nDPMUs will monitor community bank accounts and provide the CPMU with bank \naccount statements and supporting documents for consolidation 10 days after \nthe end of every month. Proposed fund-flow arrangements for the community \nfunds are given in Appendix 5. \n \n45.  No disbursement of loan proceeds will be made to a participating district and/or village \n(i) if a misprocurement has been declared by ADB or procurement actions have been identified \nas irregular, until the misprocurement or other irregularity has been corrected by the concerned \ndistrict and/or village to the satisfaction of the Government and ADB; and (ii) until a DPMU \nand/or a CIT, as applicable, has been established and is fully staffed. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n46.  The EA has implemented a number of similar projects financed by ADB and others \nduring the last 5 years, and its financial management capacity is considered adequate. The EA \nwill provide ADB with quarterly progress reports on project implementation within 30 days of \neach calendar quarter period. The Progress reports will be in English and include information on \ndisbursement and physical progress of works and the status of support programs.  \n \n47.  The Directorate General of Communicable Disease Control and Environmental Health of \nMOH and the provincial and district governments will maintain accounts and records showing a \nclear link between activities and expenditures related to the Project. They will be assisted by an \nadequate number of suitably qualified accounting staff, including a financial manager in the \nCPMU who will establish project accounting and recording systems and train staff to maintain \nthe  systems.  Auditors  will  annually  audit  all  accounts  and  statements  of  revenues  and \nexpenditure related to the Project, in accordance with auditing standards acceptable to ADB and \nusing  international  accounting  and  auditing  standards  as  a  benchmark.  Audited  financial \nstatements and project accounts, together with the report of the auditor, will be submitted within \n6 months of the close of the financial year. A separate audit opinion on the imprest accounts will \nbe included in the annual audit report.  \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n48.  To ensure that subprojects are implemented and managed effectively and that project \nbenefits are maximized, a draft project performance management system (PPMS) has been \ndeveloped in accordance with ADB\u2019s PPMS Handbook and project objectives. The PPMS will \nassist  the  Project  in  community-based  initiatives  and  interventions  through  a  participatory \napproach.32  Indicators  and  methodology  for  capacity  building  of  government  agencies  and \ncommunities,  water  improvement,  sanitation,  hygiene,  health,  financial  management,  and \nproject management are incorporated in the design of the system to facilitate the M&E of project \nbenefits. Data collection for the PPMS will be undertaken by the PMCs and one member of \neach CFT, with the latter being in charge of data collection and analysis related to the status of \nactivities at the community level. \n \n                                                 \n32 The participatory planning, monitoring, and evaluation approach is based on the approach developed under ADB. \n2000. Technical Assistance to the Government of Indonesia for Capacity Building for Participatory Planning, \nMonitoring and Evaluation. Manila (TA 3179-INO, for $1,540,000). ", "14 \n8.  Project Review \n49.  The  EA  and  ADB  will  jointly  review  progress  biannually  to  assess  implementation \nperformance. Quarterly village progress reports will be synthesized at the district level, and \nsummarized into one report for submission to the EA within 15 days of the end of the quarter. A \ncomprehensive midterm review will be carried out by the Government, the CPMU, ADB, and \nsuitable external auditors, after about 500 subprojects have been approved for implementation, \nand  after  about  200  have  been  completed,  to  evaluate  in  detail  the  project  scope, \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  achievements  of  scheduled  targets,  and  to  recommend \nnecessary measures to ensure successful achievement of project objectives. \n \n9.  Anticorruption Policy \n50.  During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to government \nofficials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption added to ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants,33 particularly the need for bidders, \nsuppliers, contractors, and consultants to observe the highest standards of ethics in procuring \nand executing ADB-financed contracts, and the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. \n \nIV.  EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE GRANT \n51.  To help restore and improve access to water supply and sanitation facilities for the rural \npopulation in Aceh and Nias-North Sumatra affected by the tsunami disaster, it is proposed to \nprovide an emergency assistance grant for these provinces. The prevalence of waterborne \ncommunicable diseases was already relatively higher than the national average before the \ndisaster. Water and sanitation service coverage was below the national average to begin with \nand has now been wiped out in many rural areas. \n \n52.  Activities  under  this  emergency  assistance  grant  will  contain  elements  of  the \nrehabilitation and reconstruction phases outlined by the Government.34 Activities during the \nimmediate rehabilitation phase will focus on the prevention of waterborne disease outbreaks \nand  vector  control  through  basic  rehabilitation  of  community  water  supply  and  sanitation \nfacilities, along with capacity building and training of relevant staff at provincial, district, and \nvillage  levels  to  engage  in  information,  education,  and  communication  campaigns  on \nwaterborne diseases and SHBC programs. During the reconstruction phase, activities will focus \non re-establishing local government and community capacity to ensure participatory planning \nand thus sustainability of the facilities provided, expansion and/or new development of water \nand  sanitation  facilities,  and  intensification  of  SHBC  programs.  The  summary  of  the  cost \nestimates for the emergency assistance grant is in Table 3. Further details are in Appendix 14. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n33 Section I.D.

The  emergency  assistance  grant  will  be  financed  through  a  grant  contribution  of \nCan$5.0 million by the Canadian International Development Agency of the Government of \nCanada, another grant of $5.0 million by the Government of the Netherlands, and another grant \nof \u00a34.0 million by the Department for International Development of the Government of the \nUnited Kingdom. The grant contributions will be fully untied and administered by ADB.  \n \n54.  Initial implementation arrangements will follow ADB\u2019s policies and procedures as stated \nin the Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, to which the cofinancing governments have \nagreed. The Policy allows for procedural flexibility with regard to operational policies relating to \nprocurement, consulting services, financial management, and disbursement.35 Disbursements \nunder this grant will be allowable for up to 100% of eligible project costs.36 Implementation \narrangements  for  this  grant  are  summarized  in  Appendix  14  and  detailed  in  the  Grant \nAgreement. During the course of implementation, arrangements will be further refined, which is \nallowed under the Policy. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n1.  Benefits and Impacts \n55.  Investment in rural water supply and sanitation, combined with SHBC programs, will \ndirectly benefit an estimated 1.2 million people (290,000 households) in the project districts, and \nstrengthen local government authorities and communities in facilitating and delivering these \nbasic services. Benefits will include (i) a reduction in poverty in the target districts, (ii) improved \ncommunity  health  and  environment,  (iii) improvement  in  gender  conditions,  (iv) community \nempowerment, and (v) increased local government capacity. \n \na.  Poverty Reduction \n56.  The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 15. The 20 target \ndistricts contain a total population of around 6 million people of whom around 1 million were \nbelow the official poverty line in 2002. However, many more people in these districts have \nincomes  close  to  the  poverty  line.  Due  to  seasonal  demands  for  labor,  family  illnesses, \nfluctuating prices, or other external shocks, they can be expected to move in and out of poverty \nover the course of the Project, and are equally unable to accumulate sufficient capital to meet \n                                                 \n35 ADB. 2004. Doc. R71-04: Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Manila. \n36 Exclusive of local taxes and duties.  ", "16 \nneeds for safe water and improved sanitation on their own.37 Given the high proportions of poor \nand near-poor households in the target districts, and the targeting of the poorest locations with \nthe highest levels of unmet need (see Appendix 5), the incidence of poverty among project \nbeneficiaries will be well over 50%. Access to safe and reliable water and sanitation facilities will \ntranslate into less time and effort spent on obtaining good quality water, freeing up time for \nincome-generating activities. Better quality water and access to improved sanitation will reduce \nthe incidence and severity of waterborne diseases, leading to a reduction in sick days and \nhealth-related expenditures. Healthier people with an increased disposable income constitute \nimproved levels of social welfare, and will facilitate efforts to improve economic welfare. \n \nb.  Community Health Benefits and Environmental Improvement \n57.  Improved access to better quality water and sanitation facilities will reduce waterborne \ndiseases among the general village population, thus improving their health status. This benefit \nwill particularly accrue to infants and children who suffer more frequently and severely from \nwaterborne and water-related diseases. The Project will contribute to reduce infant and child \nmortality as well as malnutrition caused or aggravated by waterborne diseases in the project \nareas, thus contributing indirectly to achieving MDG 4, target 5, i.e., reducing by two thirds, \nbetween 1990 and 2015, the mortality rate among children under the age of 5; and MDG 1, \ntarget 2, i.e., halving, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, \nwith the prevalence of underweight children under the age of 5 as the indicator. \n \n58.  The summary initial environmental examination is in Appendix 16. There is a positive \nimpact on the local environment of project areas due to improved sewerage management based \non new latrines, septic tanks, and waste disposal services. The amount of sewage and waste \ndisposed of in the local rivers will be reduced. Water systems developed will include improved \ndrainage systems in water source areas, thereby reducing mosquito habitat and waterborne \ndiseases.  The  potential  environmental  adverse  impacts  are  minor,  temporary,  and  can  be \nmitigated. An environmental management plan has been developed to guide the environmental \nassessment and review procedure, implementation of environmental mitigation measures, and \nenvironmental monitoring during project implementation. \n \nc.  Improvement in Gender Conditions \n59.  The Project will particularly benefit women who will obtain access to more and better \nquality water and learn about healthy and hygienic behavior. Easier access to better quality \nwater  will  result  in  time  savings  for  women  and  savings  of  financial  and  other  resources \notherwise needed to take care of sick family members. Since women will be actively involved in \nimplementing village-level projects, they will benefit from training activities, and will be able to \nuse their newly acquired experience and skills for other community-driven programs. \n \nd.  Community Empowerment \n60.  The Project will have a positive impact on communities\u2019 capacity to promote their own \ndevelopment.  The  communities\u2019  active  involvement  in  selecting,  planning,  cofinancing,  and \nimplementing project interventions, and being responsible for the outcomes and maintaining \n                                                 \n37 Raising the official poverty line by just 25% (about $3 per capita per month) would put an additional 1.2 million \npeople into poverty in these districts. See Supplementary Appendix I for further discussion. \n ", "17 \nthem, will result in their empowerment. The communities will subsequently be able to use these \nskills and social capital to undertake other community improvement activities of their choosing. \n \ne.  Strengthened Local Governments \n61.  The  performance  of  local  governments  will  be  improved  by  the  introduction  of  a \nsimplified quality management approach in public administration. Its emphasis lies in clarifying \nthe roles of local government with regard to continuous improvement in service delivery. This \nimprovement  will  be  felt  not  only  in  the  sectors  directly  affected  by  the  Project.  With  the \nintroduction of a systematic conceptual framework and clear targets for improvement, better \nservices  for  local  communities  can  be  expected,  as  well  as  greater  transparency  of  the \nfunctioning of local administration. In combination with advocacy capacity-building measures \ntargeted at the local legislative assemblies, these activities are expected to have a positive \nimpact on the development of local democratic governance. \n \nf.  Economic Analysis \n62.  ADB\u2019s Economics and Research Department developed a simplified approach for the \neconomic assessment of rural water supply projects, which is being pilot-tested in this Project. \nThe approach focuses on time savings as the key indicator of benefits accruing from rural water \nsupply projects. A test has been developed that is equivalent to determining whether the annual \nnet benefits of any village subproject exceed its annualized capital costs.38 The purpose of this \napproach is to provide criteria that can easily be applied by district staff responsible for the \nselection of villages for each district subproject and that, if met, provide a reasonable assurance \nthat  the  village-level  schemes  included  in  the  subproject  would  meet  the  normal  tests  of \nfinancial and economic viability, i.e., have an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) greater \nthan 12%. Meeting the criteria established by the test will be a requirement for all villages \nincluded in the Project. The EIRR for the sum of all water supply facilities would therefore also \nbe greater than 12%. No overall EIRR has been calculated separately for the whole Project. The \neconomic analysis is in Appendix 17. \n \n63.  Communities will be responsible for choosing the water supply system, from among the \navailable  technical  options,  that  best  suits  their  needs  and  circumstances.  Costs  for  both \nconstruction  and  O&M  will  be  significant  factors  contributing  to  their  decisions. Household \nsurveys undertaken during the PPTA suggest that the average willingness to pay on a monthly \nbasis is sufficient to finance the O&M costs of most technical options. The application of the \neconomic criteria described in Appendix 17 will identify the least-cost option for each village. \nHowever, villages can opt for a higher-level system that provides easier access and costs more \nas long as they agree to shoulder the additional costs. \n \n2.  Risks \n64.  Policy. The Project assumes a stable political environment, continued positive economic \ngrowth, and continued support of the decentralization and regional autonomy policies in place. \nChanges to the main decentralization laws that may affect provincial- or district-level authorities \nand their responsibilities would need adaptation of project implementation arrangements.  \n \n                                                 \n38 The approach and the method for applying it are outlined in Appendix 17 and elaborated in detail in Supplementary \nAppendix C. ", "18 \n65.  Local Government Capacity and Support. The full participation of local government \nagencies in supplying adequate support services to communities is imperative for the successful \nimplementation and long-term sustainability of the Project. A receptive response to capacity \nbuilding  will  ensure  that  government  capacity  to  support  community-driven  projects  is \nmaintained, implementation schedules are adhered to, and counterpart funds are available and \nreleased on time. Continuity in the leadership of government officials is required for timely \nproject implementation. The Project\u2019s emphasis on facilitating change and instigating a reform \nwithin  the  local  governments  will  help  generate  long-term  commitments  to  better  service \ndelivery.  \n \n66.  Community Facilitation. The key to the effective empowering of communities lies with \nthe community facilitators. Experienced community facilitators are generally expensive and in \nshort supply. Intensive training of the facilitators, coupled with close supervision, monitoring, \nand  back-stopping  will  be  required  to  ensure  quality  control  and  effective  community \nmobilization.  The  Project  has  allocated  sufficient  resources  to  intensively  train  qualified \nfacilitators and to supervise their performance. Nonperforming facilitators will be replaced. \n \n67.  Community Participation and Ownership. Communities will actively participate in the \ndesign, and accept responsibility for the management and cofunding, of water and sanitation \nfacilities, and for O&M to ensure the facilities\u2019 long-term sustainability. Sufficient social cohesion \nwithin the community is required to manage the water supply and sanitation schemes on a \nsustainable  basis.  Participatory  planning  will  ensure  that  communities  mobilize  sufficient \nresources and are willing to pay for their share of construction and O&M costs, particularly in \ncommunities where costs may be high because of physically difficult terrain.  \n \n68.  Environmental Conditions. For particular villages, especially those in peat swamps \nwhere surface and shallow groundwater is of very poor quality, finding an appropriate and \naffordable technical solution for water supply and sanitation may be difficult. The Project will \nundertake an initial environmental screening for each village before the communities produce a \nCAP.  The  screening  will  encompass  identification  of  the  subproject  type,  scale,  location, \nsensitivity, and nature and magnitude of potential impacts.39 Subprojects in villages that do not \npass the screening will not be pursued.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n69.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The  Government  will  ensure  adequate  budgetary  allocations  of  the  required \ncounterpart funds for the CPMU and the DPMUs and their timely release. \n(ii)  The Government will seek prior approval of ADB for any change of the CPMU \nproject manager. The term of office of the CPMU project manager is at least for \ntwo years, and every effort will be made to identify suitable qualified women to fill \nsome of the CPMU positions. \n(iii)  The Government will ensure implementation of the GAP. \n                                                 \n39 Details are in Appendix 16 and the Project Administration Memorandum. \n ", "19 \n(iv)  The Government will promote full participation of indigenous peoples in project \nactivities,  including,  among  other  things,  developing  mechanisms  to  include \nindigenous  peoples  in  capacity  building  and  training  under  the  Project.  The \nPPMS  will  include  performance  indicators  that  facilitate  the  monitoring  of \nparticipation of indigenous peoples in project activities. The Government will \nensure that project activities are carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on \nindigenous peoples, and that the Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Development Framework \nis implemented.  \n(v)  The Government will ensure that a basic environmental impact assessment is \ncarried out as part of the planning process of subprojects at the community level, \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  and  the  initial \nenvironmental  examination.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  design, \nconstruction, and operation of water supply and sanitation facilities will comply \nwith applicable national laws, regulations, and standards. \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that all land acquisition and resettlement plans will \nbe approved by ADB prior to award of civil works contracts for subprojects, in \naccordance with the resettlement framework agreed upon by the Government \nand  ADB;  the  Government\u2019s  laws,  regulations,  and  procedures;  and  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements as defined in ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement.40 In case of \ndiscrepancies between the Government\u2019s laws, regulations, and procedures and \nADB\u2019s requirements, ADB\u2019s requirements will apply. \n(vii)  The  Government  agrees  that  no  disbursement  will  be  made  from  the  loan \naccount for any subproject scheme that is not based on an approved CAP and a \nsigned contract between the DPMU and the CIT following the demand-driven, \ncommunity-based approach outlined in the Project. \n(viii)  For the Aceh/Nias-North Sumatra Emergency Assistance Grant, the Government  \nwill ensure that detailed project information, including on bidding procedures, \nparticipating  bidders  and  winners,  contract  awards,  goods  and  services \npurchased  and  actual  utilization,  community  block  grants  received,  and \ncooperation with other development agencies will be posted on a website to be \ndetermined by agreement of ADB and the Government.  \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness41 \n70.  The following are conditions for loan effectiveness: \n \n(i)  The DPMUs have been set up and are staffed. \n(ii)  The Government has established the project steering committee. \n(iii)  The Government has certified that budget approval documents for the loan and \ncounterpart funds for the first year of project implementation have been issued \nand all necessary budget approval documents for on-granting loan proceeds to at \nleast eight (8) participating districts have been approved and disseminated. \n(iv)  The Government has issued a decision or other regulation satisfactory to ADB on \nproject disbursement arrangements and the flow of funds. \n                                                 \n40 Details of the Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework are in Appendix 18. \n41 Conditions for effectiveness are based on the project readiness criteria agreed upon between the Government and \nADB.

In 2000, water and \nsanitation conditions were fairly similar to countries such as Myanmar and Viet Nam, but were \nbelow those that had been achieved in the Philippines and Thailand, especially with regard to \naccess to improved sanitation (Table A2.1). \n \nTable A2.1: Summary Water and Sanitation Conditions, Selected Asian Countries \n    Population with Sustainable  Population with Access to \n    Access to an Improved Water  Improved Sanitation (2000)b \nCountry  HDI Rank  Source (2000)a \nThailand  74  84  96 \nPhilippines  85  86  83 \nSri Lanka  99  77  94 \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China  104  75  40 \nViet Nam  109  77  47 \nIndonesia  112  78  55 \nIndia  127  84  28 \nCambodia  130  30  17 \nMyanmar  131  72  64 \nLao People\u2019s Dem.

Progress has been moderate in terms of the applicable Millennium Development Goal \n(MDG) target,1 and inequality in access between urban and rural areas, and between the better-\noff and the poor persists. Pipe and pump systems remain largely an urban phenomenon in \nIndonesia, and there has been little change in either levels or the urban-rural gap in recent \nyears. In rural areas, close to one third of households still do not have access to safe water. As \nto sanitation, the use of toilet facilities and/or septic tanks for human waste disposal still remains \nthe exception rather than the rule in much of rural Indonesia. \n \n3.  Based on data from the National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS) 2002, more than a \nthird (37%) of households in the poorest quintile (Q1) lack access to pipe, pump, or water from \nprotected wells or springs for drinking purposes, and over 80% lack access to toilets and/or final \ndisposal via septic tanks. This can be compared to the richest quintile (Q5) where only 14% of \nhouseholds lack access to similar qualities of water and around one fifth to one quarter (20\u2013\n27%) access to similar levels of sanitation. \n \n4.  Although  there  is  some  variation,  the  Project\u2019s  target  provinces  and  districts  are \ngenerally less well served, and the poorest quintile is worse off than national averages (Table \nA2.2). In most of the target districts in Kalimantan and some in Sumatra, less than 40% of \nhouseholds have access to safe water, and in the great majority of cases less than one third of \n                                                 \n1  MDG 7, target 10: to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and \nbasic sanitation.

The problem is particularly severe in the two provinces in Kalimantan where there is \nheavy reliance on increasingly polluted river water for drinking, and only a small minority of \nhouseholds has access to toilet facilities.  \n \nTable A2.2: Selected Indicators on Access to Safe Water and Sanitation by Urban/Rural \nResidence and Household Per Capita Expenditure Quintiles, Project Provinces, 2002 \n \n    Households with     \n    Pipe, Pump,     \n  Households with  Protected Well or    Households with \nItem  Pipe or Pump  Spring Source of  Households with  Final Disposal \nSource of Drinking  Drinking Water  Access to Toilet  Using Septic Tank \nWater  Facilities \nTotal Indonesia  32.8  74.6  46.3  39.8 \n     Urban  54.5  87.2  70.0  63.2 \n     Rural  15.2  64.3  27.1  20.7 \nJambi         \n     Total  19.2  49.2  37.4  30.4 \n     Urban  40.8  74.7  73.9  67.0 \n     Rural  10.7  39.2  23.1  16.1 \n     Q1  10.3  37.4  20.5  16.1 \n     Q5  35.5  64.7  64.0  53.3 \nBengkulu         \n     Total  13.5  54.3  45.0  24.3 \n     Urban  33.6  75.8  87.4  62.8 \n     Rural  5.2  45.4  27.5  8.5 \n     Q1  3.6  43.3  18.2  7.4 \n     Q5  38.6  80.3  89.8  63.1 \nWest Kalimantan         \n     Total  11.3  17.4  35.4  25.4 \n     Urban  27.5  32.9  73.1  64.8 \n     Rural  5.7  12.1  22.4  11.8 \n     Q1  4.0  6.6  12.6  6.7 \n     Q5  29.3  35.8  72.0  61.6 \nCentral Kalimantan         \n     Total  25.8  37.4  28.4  20.6 \n     Urban  65.4  76.2  64.0  55.0 \n     Rural  9.2  21.1  13.5  6.2 \n     Q1  11.6  17.9  13.7  5.7 \n     Q5  45.7  58.6  49.8  39.1 \nQ1 = poorest quintile, Q5 = richest quintile \nSource: National Socioeconomic Survey SUSENAS, 2002.  \nB.  Health and Hygiene Behavior \n5.  Collected data and information on the status of Indonesia\u2019s health sector in general, and \non the incidence and mortality rates from waterborne or water-related diseases in particular, \nshow varying degrees of validity and accuracy and should thus be treated with caution. The \nnational surveillance system regarding communicable diseases is still in its infancy, and data by \ndistrict are virtually unavailable.  \n \n6.  Since  1990,  the  periodic  National  Demographic  and  Health  Surveys  (DHS)  have \nreported  prevalence  rates2  for  diarrhea  among  children  under  age  5  during  the  2  weeks \npreceding the survey. Results for Indonesia and the four target provinces from the last three \n                                                 \n2  Prevalence rates measure whether or not a child experienced a particular disease during a specific period of time.    \n   This is different from incidence, which measures the number of occurrences of a diseases during a period of time. \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nrounds of the DHS are shown in Table A2.3. However, the small sample sizes for province \nestimates, and the relatively short reference period to improve recall, make the use of this date \nproblematic. \n \nTable A2.3: Prevalence Rates for Diarrhea \n \n  Percent of Children Under Age 5 Experiencing Diarrheaa \nRegion/Province  1993  1997  2003 \nAs compared to national average  11.0  10.4  12.1 \nJambi    8.1   8.2  10.9 \nBengkulu    8.2  16.5  21.6 \nWest Kalimantan    8.3  15.0  14.4 \nCentral Kalimantan    2.4  19.5    5.8 \na During the 2 weeks preceding each survey.  \nSource: National Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), 1993, 1997, and 2003.  \n \n7.  In addition, the Ministry of Health (MOH) conducts other surveys in cooperation with the \nNational Statistics Board (BPS),3 but the quality of data is weak, table presentations are often \nunclear, and the results are not very widely disseminated or published. The latest of these \nsurveys in 2000 showed a national diarrheal incidence rate of 1.278 for children under age 5. \nThis suggests that diarrheal disease incidence in Indonesia is already fairly low for children \nunder  5  on  a  national  basis.  However,  diarrhea  is  only  one  aspect  of  the  general  health \nconditions of rural Indonesia, and the project focus will encompass other aspects of individual \nand  community  health  that  impact  on  the  quality  of  life  in  the  target  provinces.  A  critical \ncomponent will thus be the hygiene behavioral change interventions of the Project. \n \n8.  The  Indonesian  surveillance  system  for  worm  infestation4  only  began  in  2002. \nPrevalence rates have no statistical validity and there is no sampling frame for the 10 provinces \nsurveyed. Both malaria and dengue fever are included in MOH\u2019s integrated surveillance system \nof 29 selected diseases, in which all provinces are supposed to participate. For malaria, passive \ncase detection, clinical diagnosis and treatment, active case detection, and laboratory diagnosis \nare limited to Java and Bali, and mortality rates are not available.  \n \n9.  In the past, many programs and projects have tended to focus on technical infrastructure \nor medical treatment solutions (such as oral rehydration therapy for diarrhea), rather than \nattempting to tackle the human behavior challenge. Behavioral change strategies, which focus \non prevention rather than treatment, are included in projects but are found to be delayed and \ndiluted during implementation. \n \n10.  More  recently,  commercial  advertising  techniques  and  various  participatory \nmethodologies  have  been  developed  to  attack  the  chronic  problems  of  implementation  of \nbehavioral change related to sanitation and hygiene. These new techniques have largely come \nfrom outside the medical establishment and have yet to be widely adopted by rural public health \nservices, which continue to either skirt the issue of hygiene behavioral change or tend to impose \ninappropriate and often resented sanctions that do little to win popular support for improved \nhygiene  behavior  or  practices.  Addressing  this  problem  in  ways  that  are  appropriate, \nacceptable, and that lead to sustainable changes in human behavior thus constitutes one of the \nmajor challenges for the Project. \n \n                                                 \n3  These are known as the household health surveys (Survei Kesehatan Rumah Tangga). Several rounds have been \ncarried out, with each survey covering 6\u201310 provinces at a time. \n4  Such as ascariasis, dracunculiasis, hookworm, tapeworm, threadworm, and whipworm.

Similarly, the Rural Water Supply and \nSanitation Sector Project (RWSSP)2 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) covered 80 districts \nin  12  provinces,  with  over  4,400  communities  spread  over  very  large  and  often  relatively \ninaccessible areas, which had a negative impact on project implementation and monitoring. The \nProject has therefore limited the number of provinces and districts within these provinces, while \nat the same time increasing the number of villages covered in each district to maximize impact. \n \n2.  Simplify Implementation and Fund Channeling Arrangements. Experience under \nRWSSP with too many government agencies involved at various administrative levels led to \npoor coordination of activities and difficulties in monitoring a system of thousands of small works \ncontracts. Complicated fund channeling mechanisms also hampered the World Bank\u2019s Water \nSupply and Sanitation for Low Income Communities Project (WSSLIC). Recent decentralization \nposes a challenge in that more hierarchy levels want to have a say in project implementation. \nThe  Project  will  ensure  that  a  single  project  management  organization  will  have  sufficient \nauthority  to  resolve  coordination  and  implementation  issues  in  a  timely  manner,  and  that \ndelegation of decision making to lower levels is implemented where feasible. \n \n3.  Offer a Simple Water and Sanitation Technology Menu. In past projects in Indonesia, \nthe use of standardized technology, which turned out to be too costly and too complicated to \nmaintain and repair, was imposed on communities. To promote a sense of ownership and to \nincrease  the  willingness  to  pay  for  capital  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs, \ncommunities need to choose the facilities they want and are willing to pay for. The Project has \ndeveloped a menu of 10 easily understandable water supply options and three options for \nsanitation along the lines of the menu that was prepared under WSLIC II to help communities \nmake an informed choice. The menu allows for incremental upgrading of basic facilities, if the \ncommunity is willing to pay the full incremental cost. Communities will receive extensive advise \non the costs each of the options involve (both capital and O&M), the feasibility according to \ntopography and population, and the potential for incremental upgrading, among others. Tariffs \nand user fees for services will depend on the technology option chosen by the community, and \nshould usually cover at least O&M costs. Based on the WSLIC experience, user fees will need \nto be determined and agreed upon in detail in the community action plan prior to construction. \n \n4.  Engage Communities at All Project Stages. Several previous ADB projects in rural \nwater and sanitation were affected by poor community acceptance of schemes because of \ninadequate involvement and consultation, which resulted in slow uptake of connections and \ninadequate cost recovery. Communities need to have the right to control key activities with \nregard to planning, design, and construction of facilities, which in turn has proven to be an \nantidote against corruption in previous projects. Also, investment into upgrading community \ncapacity and capability (particularly for O&M and repair) is needed to ensure sustainability of \nproject  investments.  In  the  Project,  communities  will  be  engaged  from  the  beginning  and \nthroughout the full project cycle.  \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2000.

Community  facilitators  will  be  a  key  factor  in \nensuring  the  success  of  the  Project  as  they  are  responsible  for  community  planning  and \npreparation  before  the  construction  of  facilities.  In  WSLIC-II,  training  and  mobilization  of \nfacilitators were significantly delayed, thus delaying the whole project implementation. Under \nRWSSP, local training programs were generally not synchronized with work implementation, not \nsufficiently financed, and too short in duration. The Project will ensure that facilitator recruitment, \ntraining, supervision, and replacements will be delivered in a timely and synchronized manner. \n \n6.  Encourage  Increasing  Community  Contributions.  The  community  contribution \nformula under WSLIC-II (20%, including 16% in kind and 4% in cash) is working well, thus a \nsimilar formula will be applied under the Project. However, the Project will encourage increasing \nthe cash contribution by the community, in particular for facilities that go beyond basic services \nlevels (such as fully piped, in-house water systems). \n \n7.  Monitor  Quality  of  Construction  and  Personnel  Performance.  Poor  quality  of \nconstruction and inadequate personnel performance has plagued many rural water supply and \nsanitation projects in the past.3 In RWSSP, the low quality of construction was attributed to \ncompulsory use of nonskilled and nontrained village labor by contractors, combined with lack of \nsupervision. Performance monitoring of consultants, NGOs, participating government agencies, \nand private sector organizations is crucial to the success of the Project. Communities will be \nadequately trained to demand and assess high quality construction and assistance, combined \nwith professional and regular independent quality monitoring and control of activities. \n \n8.  Emphasize Sanitation and Hygiene Behavioral Change (SHBC).  Since improved \nwater supply and sanitation facilities are insufficient to dramatically reduce waterborne diseases, \nSHBC needs to be given as much attention as the actual construction of facilities. In previous \nprojects, such as RWSSP, health education and community programs were treated as an \u201cadd \non\u201d and based mainly on standard training, which did not adequately address the issue of \nsustaining a change in behavior. Experience of projects inside and outside of Indonesia has \ndemonstrated that a range of country- or district-specific motivating factors beyond health (such \nas social status enhancement from having a sanitary toilet, convenience, time savings, people\u2019s \ndesire for a smell-free home) will need to be emphasized in the SHBC component, particularly \nfor first-time in-house water and sanitation users.4 \n \n9.  Ensure  Transparency  and  Accountability  of  Project  Administration  and \nProcurement. Ensuring full transparency and public accountability of project administration and \nprocurement is crucial to stimulating community participation and commitment to project policies \nand procedures. Rural water and sanitation projects are notoriously slow and cumbersome in \nimplementation, leading to high levels of frustration among initially very motivated communities. \nTo address this, advance actions in terms of establishing and staffing central- and district-level \nproject offices, and recruiting central-level consultants, will be initiated well in advance of project \nimplementation.  Administration  and  procurement  procedures  will  be  clearly  explained  to \ncommunities  so  that  they  are  capable  of  monitoring  progress  from  their  side  as  well. \nAccountability procedures such as public disclosure of budgets, tenders, contracts, and terms of \nreference will ensure good governance and help prevent fraud and corruption.  \n                                                 \n3  World Bank. 2000.

A long-list of villages was determined during the project preparatory technical assistance \nbased on socioeconomic and water and health technical factors. The long-list is only indicative \nat this stage as the selection of villages to participate in the proposed Project will be determined \nby  the  districts  during  the  early  stage  of  implementation  through  project  orientation  and \nconsultation phases. Village participation criteria are in Box A6. \n \n \nBox A6: Village Participation Criteria  \n \n(i)  Community commitment through Letter of Intent, confirming \n(a)  no other clean water or drinking water projects ongoing or planned for the village; \n(b)  formation of a community implementation team (CIT); \n(c)  willingness to prepare a community action plan (CAP); \n(d)  willingness to contribute 16% of subproject construction costs in-kind; \n(e)  willingness to contribute 4% in cash; \n(f)  willingness to pay all user fees afterward (operation and maintenance, etc.); \n(g)  willingness to conduct required operation and maintenance on the system; and \n(h)  willingness to conduct sanitation and hygiene behavioral change program. \n \n(ii)  Geographic requisite: at least three qualifying villages per subdistrict. \n \n(iii)  Socioeconomic factors, including  \n(a)  village poverty rate (based on Family Planning Agency methodology) of more than \n25% of households classified as pre-welfare or welfare-1; and  \n(b)  minimum village population of at least 100 households per village. \n \n(iv)  Health and technical factors (any one factor qualifies village for inclusion in Project): \n(a)  percentage of households with access to improved latrines < 50%; \n(b)  percentage of households requiring more than 30 minutes to access water and return \nit to home > 30%; \n(c)  water availability/reliability < 9 months per year for > 30% of households; \n(d)  level of fecal chloroform, arsenic > Ministry of Health/World Health Organization \ntechnical standard;  \n(e)  percentage of dug wells intruded by salt-water, smell, or otherwise contaminated > \n10%; or, \n(f)  per capita water availability < 15 liters per person per day  \n \n \n2.  Following confirmation of village participation, villages will prepare a Community Action \nPlan (CAP). The CAP will be approved by the District Project Management Unit (DPMU). The \nCAP will  \n \n(i)  propose solutions to overcome water supply, sanitation, and/or health problems \nthat are at an appropriate level of technology and reasonable budget level (i.e., \nwithin  the  proposed  maximum  limit  of  Rp250 million  for  water  supply  and \nsanitation facilities per village); \n(ii)  be required to pass the economic assessment test outlined in Appendix 17; and \n(iii)  be required to pass the environmental screening process outlined in Appendix \n16. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 7  33 \nINDIGENOUS PEOPLES\u2019 DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK \nA.  Project Background \n1.  The Project will provide rural water supply and sanitation facilities and services to about \n1,000 communities in 20 districts in the provinces of West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, \nJambi, and Bengkulu. Following a demand-driven, community-based approach, the Project will \nprovide an estimated 1.2 million people with safe drinking water, of whom about 0.6 million will \nalso benefit from improved sanitation facilities. The Project will also facilitate capacity building of \nlocal  governments  and  the  communities  themselves,  and  raise  awareness  on  appropriate \nsanitation and hygiene behavior to maximize the investment impact. \n \n2.  Indigenous  peoples  (IPs)1  were  identified  during  the  sample  village  field  studies \nconducted in Kalimantan, and it is probable that they will be found in other areas of all four \nproject provinces during implementation. IP risks are expected to generally be minor due to the \ncommunity-driven,  participatory  approach  of  the  Project,  which  requires  adequate \nrepresentation of marginal groups on the community implementation team (CIT). The Project \nwill seek to identify locations with significant IP presence and ensure that necessary information \nand facilitation is provided to ensure equal inclusion in the Project. \n \nB.  Objectives of the Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Development Framework \n3.  The  objectives  of  the  Indigenous  Peoples\u2019  Development  Framework  (IPDF)  are  to \nensure that IPs (i) participate fully in the Project; (ii) are aware of their rights and responsibilities \nwith regard to the Project; and (iii) are able to voice their needs during the community problem \nmapping and planning meetings, and community action plan (CAP) formulation. \n \nC.  Institutional Arrangements/Strategy to Ensure IP Participation \n4.  To ensure full participation in the Project and adequate reflection of their specific needs \nin the CAPs, the following arrangements will be made: \n \n(i)  Community facilitator teams (CFTs) will be trained in the identification of IPs. \nThrough baseline surveys, community self-help exercises, and discussions on \ncommunity empowerment, facilitators will identify the presence and numbers of \nIP groups in the community and report this to the district project management \nunit (DPMU) and district support team (DST); \n(ii)  For the areas where IP groups are identified, the DSTs will organize orientation \ntraining for relevant community facilitators on how to work with groups of IPs to \nidentify mechanisms for effective participation, and address specific challenges in \nworking with such groups; \n(iii)  Where IP groups are identified, efforts will be made to ensure that at least one \nCIT member is from the group and able to communicate easily with the group; \nand \n(iv)  Where  the  IPs  speak  a  language  different  from  Bahasa  Indonesia,  relevant \nbrochures and documents will be translated into the appropriate language. \n \n                                                 \n1  According to Presidential Decree No. 111/1999 on Empowering Social Welfare of Communities in Isolated and \nRemote Areas, IPs in Indonesia are defined as communities with a distinct culture, who live in remote areas, and \nhave limited access to social, economic, and political activities. \n ", "34  Appendix 7 \n5.  CFT members will be hired locally to the extent possible and are likely to be familiar with \nsuch groups. They will also be rotated as necessary to ensure that those that have been trained \nin working with IP groups, or have specific skills that would be beneficial in working with such \ngroups, are available in the right places. \n \nD.  Impacts on and Benefits for Indigenous Peoples \n6.  The  initial  poverty  and  social  assessments  done  by  CFTs  for  each  subproject  will \nindicate the magnitude and type of IP impacts. Participation of IPs is expected to lead mostly to \npositive benefits. If a community turns out to be fully indigenous, the CAP will serve the purpose \nof an Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Development Plan (IPDP), to be prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \npolicy on indigenous peoples. These CAPs will be subject to the approval of ADB. \n \n7.  IP-specific  actions  will  be  commensurate  with  the  impact  severity  level  of  each \nsubproject affecting vulnerable groups. Impact severity is defined based on the degree of \nvulnerability of the affected peoples and the type of impacts, i.e., (i) limited impacts occur when \n(a) the affected peoples are fully integrated in mainstream society and in control of the local \nadministrative  system,  and/or  (b)  impacts  do  not  have  broad  community  or  sociocultural \ndimensions; and (ii) severe impacts occur when (a) the affected peoples maintain a degree of \nsociocultural and institutional distinction from mainstream society and/or (b) impacts carry a \nbroad sociocultural dimension and have wide community effects. \n \n8.  Action  for  limited  impacts  will  include  a  brief  assessment  of  the  affected  peoples\u2019 \nsocioeconomic and cultural status, and the preparation of specific actions to address associated \nconcerns, which will be included in the CAP. Action for severe impacts will require the CAP to \nserve as a full IPDP including (i) an assessment of the affected peoples\u2019 situation, and (ii) an IP \naction plan detailing needed rehabilitation/development provisions and related implementation \nmechanisms and processes. IPDPs will be designed and implemented through a participatory \nmethodology involving the affected peoples and other stakeholders. \n \n9.  For the preparation and implementation of CAPs to serve as IPDPs, the Project will \nmainly rely on the CFTs, with assistance and supervision from the DSTs. The CFTs\u2019 main tasks \nare to (i) ensure effective community self-organization; (ii) facilitate, monitor, and supervise the \nformulation  and  implementation  of  the  CAP;  and  (iii) ensure  effective  monitoring  of  CAP \nactivities, including IP-specific actions. The CFTs will consist of three experts, one of them being \na community mobilization and equity specialist whose responsibility is to ensure the active \nparticipation of all village stakeholders, including IPs, women, and the poor. The CFTs will be \nhired as part of the consultant packages for each province and will assist each community \nthroughout the whole project cycle. Thus, the preparation and implementation of IPDPs in lieu of \nCAPs or IP-specific actions as part of the CAPs are fully budgeted. \n \nE.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n10.  Where IPs are identified, these will be flagged to the DPMU by the CFTs and DSTs, and \nthe DPMU will report to the CPMU and ADB on IPs\u2019 participation in project activities on a \nbiannual basis. Provisions will also be made in the project reporting system for monitoring the \ninvolvement of IPs. Provisions will be made so that any issues or complaint can be raised, \nrecorded, and resolved with the DPMU. Designated staff within the DPMU will be responsible \nfor following up on complaints, and ensuring that they are handled promptly and adequately until \nresolved. \n ", "  Appendix 8  35 \nGENDER ACTION PLAN \nA.  Preparatory Work Undertaken \n1.  Workshops,  focus  group  discussions,  and  the  socioeconomic  and  health  survey \nundertaken  during  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  stage  revealed  widespread \nenthusiasm for active involvement of women in the Project. While women and men participating \nin the survey reported that they are equally responsible for collecting water for household use, \nthis depends largely on the closeness of the source of water, quantity to be collected, and \nseasons. The survey also revealed that while local sanitation conditions were dismal, little value \nwas placed on women\u2019s access to improved sanitation facilities. To get more women to adopt \nimproved hygiene practices, properly trained community facilitators will need to pay particular \nattention to this through appropriate learning tools and materials in local languages.  \n \nB.  Gender Action Plan \n2.  The Project will make considerable efforts to actively engage women in project activities, \nhire them in key positions as facilitators and trainers, solicit the support and participation of \nwomen\u2019s organizations at the grassroots level, and focus on particular groups of women, among \nthem the poor, mothers with your children, and women-headed households. The summary \ngender action plan (GAP) below outlines how the Project will address gender dimensions. The \nkey strategies underlining the GAP include: \n \n(i)  active involvement of women as both implementors and beneficiaries; during \ncommunity consultations, workshops, and focus group discussions, at least 50% \nof the participants should be women, including poor women, women household \nheads, and mothers with infants and young school children; \n(ii)  engagement of women teachers, the women\u2019s Family Welfare Movement (PKK), \nvillage midwives, health volunteers, and other women activists, for information, \neducation and communication (IEC) campaigns with particular target groups on \nthe benefits of using clean water for hygiene and sanitation purposes; \n(iii)  engagement of female community facilitators at equal salary to male facilitators \nto attract women\u2019s active participation in IEC campaigns and the implementation \nof behavioral change; \n(iv)  appropriate representation of women on the community implementation team \n(CIT)  to  ensure  that  the  community  action  plan  (CAP)  adequately  reflects \nwomen\u2019s interests; and \n(v)  specific training activities for village women. \n \nC.  Gender Monitoring and Evaluation \n3.  The Central Support Team (CST) includes a national gender specialist for a total input of \n8 months over the first three years. In addition, the terms of reference for the community and \nequity specialist in the district support teams (DSTs) require gender expertise and awareness. \nThe GAP will be implemented in line with the overall implementation schedule of the Project. \nThe project performance monitoring system (PPMS) will incorporate gender-sensitive indicators \nspecified in the GAP. The baseline and end-of-project surveys will involve at least 50% of \nwomen out of the total respondents, and disaggregate households by gender, ethnic groups, \nand socioeconomic background. \n \n \n ", "36  Appendix 8 \n \nTable A8: Gender Action Plan \n \nProject Components  Actions Proposed \n1.

To help restore and improve access to water supply and sanitation facilities for the rural \npopulation in Aceh and Nias-North Sumatra affected by the tsunami disaster, it is proposed to \nprovide an emergency assistance grant for these provinces. The emergency assistance grant \nwill  be  administered  directly  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  funded  by  the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom, the Government of Canada, and the Government of the \nNetherlands. About five districts and 500 villages will be covered by the grant over a period of 4 \nyears. Activities under this grant will contain elements of the rehabilitation and reconstruction \nphases outlined by the Government.1 The total cost of the grant is estimated to be $16.5 million \nequivalent, comprising $1.3 million (7.7%) in foreign exchange cost and $15.2 million (92.3%) \nequivalent in local currency cost.

Implementation  arrangements  for  this  emergency  grant  will  be  finalized  during \nimplementation,  which  is  acceptable  under  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Policy.  Initial \nimplementation  arrangements  envisage  a  domestic  Aceh  Coordinator,  seconded  by  an \ninternational  adviser  and  a  procurement  specialist,  to  be  placed  with  the  Central  Project \nManagement Unit of the Project at the Ministry of Health. It is estimated that around 8 person-\nmonths of international and 408 person-months of domestic consulting services will be needed \nto support the Central, Provincial, and District Project Management Units. In addition, suitable \nNGOs and/or individuals will be contracted as community facilitators to be placed at subdistrict \nand village level.  \n \n3.  Following project \u201croad shows\u201d in districts and subdistricts, village representatives will be \nable to directly hand in a simple application form. Village selection will be based on priority \ncriteria such as the extent of damage from the earthquake or the tsunami, the number of IDPs \ntaken in, and health and technical factors (such as percentage of households with access to \nwater and latrines, water quality standards, and prevalence rates for diarrhea among children \nunder age 5, among others). \n \n4.  Villages who have applied will be visited by the community facilitators to conduct a \nparticipatory rapid appraisal, which will be the basis for a rapid community action plan (CAP). \nCommunities will receive a block grant of maximum Rp200 million for the investments.2 Cash \ncontributions of 4% of the total block grant as implemented in the other project provinces will be \nwaived; in-kind contribution in the form of labor or material input will be strongly encouraged, \nwith  adequate  cash  remuneration  to  help  restore  livelihoods.  Latrine  construction  will  be \nsubsidized for up to 80% of the village population to ensure adequate sanitation coverage.3 As \nin the other project provinces, communities will be fully in charge of the continuous operation \nand  maintenance  costs  of  the  facilities  provided.  However,  in  severely  affected  villages, \noperation and maintenance cost responsibility may be phased in after an initial period of 1 to 1 \n\u00bd years during which the grant would cover these. \n \n5.  In order to provide a rapid response to the natural disaster, community facilitators from \nAceh and Nias-North Sumatra will be trained while villages are enrolling, using a mentoring and \non-the-job training approach through an experienced NGO from elsewhere in the country who \nwill provide field team facilitators for each district and will develop the first 10 rapid CAPs for \nfunding in 2005. The community facilitator teams will have the same composition as in the other \nproject provinces, and will receive further stages of training during the life of the grant. While \nbasic approaches to participatory planning will be used for identification of technologies and \nstrategies for implementation, this approach will be modified during the rehabilitation phase to \nencourage a rapid response to those areas affected by the disaster. During the reconstruction \nphase, the development of CAPs will be staged to be more in line with the guidelines for the \nother project provinces. \n \n                                                 \n2  The block grant ceiling may be adjusted depending on the average size of villages to be included, which can only \nbe assessed during project implementation.  \n3  For comparison, in the original project provinces, the subsidy is for the poorest 10% of households per village only. \nThe sanitation subsidy program will be designed in a way to maximize village sanitation coverage. \n ", "48  Appendix 15 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \nA.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \nAccess to a reliable supply of clean water is a major problem for poor rural households. Community planned, \nimplemented, operated, and maintained water services improve sanitation and health of residents, increase work \nproductivity, improve livelihood security, and provide opportunities for sustainable livelihood development for poor rural \nfamilies.  These  contributions  are  in  line  with  the  poverty  partnership  agreement  (2001\u20132004)  signed  by  the \nGovernment and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which emphasizes increasing the productivity of the poor \nthrough empowerment, development of infrastructure (especially in rural and remote areas), and human resource \ndevelopment by improving access to and quality of basic services of the poor and in remote areas. It is also in line with \nthe ADB Country Strategy and Program (CSP) Update (2004\u20132006) with its focus on strengthening institutions that \ngovern the poor, supporting sustainable pro-poor growth, promoting balanced regional equity focusing on rural and \nisolated  area  development,  investment  in  human  and  social  development  and  strengthening  environmental \nmanagement to ensure sustainable use of natural resources. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe Project will provide access to reliable water supply and improved practices in sanitation and hygiene to some of \nthe poorest and most underserved areas in the country. The 20 target districts contain a total population of around \n6 million people of whom about 1 million were below the official poverty line in 2002. However, many more people in \nthese districts have incomes close to the poverty line. Due to seasonal demands for labor, family illnesses, fluctuating \nprices, or other external shocks, they can be expected to move in and out of poverty over the course of the Project, \nand would be just as unable to accumulate sufficient savings to meet needs for water and sanitation on their own as \nthe officially poor.  \nAccess to safe water and sanitation is low in the target provinces compared to national averages, especially among \nthe poor. Among the poorest quintile access to clean water is less than 25% (compared to 54% among the richest \nquintile) and barely 10% have access to toilet facilities and/or septic tanks (compared to closer to half of the richest \nquintile). Based on the high proportions of poor and near-poor households in the target districts and given the Project\u2019s \nfocus on the poorest locations with highest levels of unmet need (Appendix 5), the incidence of poverty among project \nbeneficiaries will be well over 50%. Access to safe, reliable, water and sanitation facilities will help reduce poverty in \nthese districts in a number of ways. Improved access will translate into less time and effort spent on obtaining good \nquality water, freeing up time for income-generating activities. Better quality water and access to improved sanitation \nwill reduce the incidence and severity of waterborne and water-related diseases, leading to a reduction in sick days \nand health-related expenditures. This is expected to lead to improved levels of social welfare, and to facilitate efforts to \nimprove economic welfare of beneficiaries that are beyond the specific scope of the Project. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nThe participation strategy for activities supported by the Project will focus on empowering people, especially poor \nfamilies, women, women-headed households, and other vulnerable groups in communities with significant problems of \naccess to clean water supply and sanitation facilities and of related health problems due to poor sanitation and \nhygiene  behavior.  This  will  be  accomplished  through  intensive  community  consultations,  and  the  creation  of \ncommunity implementation teams, which will include representatives of the poor and women. District government \ntechnical  staff  and  trained  community  facilitators  will  use  Participatory  Hygiene  and  Sanitation  Transformation \n(PHAST) techniques to assist in the creation and strengthening of these teams. The teams will be responsible for \n(i) analyzing their own situation in terms of water, sanitation, and hygiene behavior affecting health; (ii) formulating \ncommunity actions plans as the basis for project investments; (iii) participating in the implementation and monitoring; \nand (iv) undertaking continuous maintenance and operation activities in a participatory manner, with adequate cost \nsharing among all community members involved. \n ", "  Appendix 15  49 \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe gender and development strategy will include various steps (including PHAST techniques) to enhance women\u2019s \naccess to information, participation in water service, sanitation, and hygiene behavioral change activities, and their \nability  to  protect  their  interests  and  improve  their  livelihoods.  Through  gender  sensitization,  use  of  gender-\ndisaggregated data, and gender analyses in the water and health development planning, awareness about gender and \ndevelopment issues will be created among the local government staff as well as in community groups and among \nservice providers. Where they are active, the project will seek to actively involve existing women\u2019s groups or \norganizations in the project structure. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Introduction \n1.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) for the proposed Project was carried out to \nidentify necessary measures to prevent or mitigate any adverse environmental impacts that \ncould possibly arise from its implementation. The Project is classified as environmental category \nB. IEEs for four pilot subprojects were carried out during the project preparatory technical \nassistance, and a summary of these is in Supplementary Appendix D. The IEE was prepared \nbased on meetings held with provincial- and district-level environmental agencies, reports by \nrelevant government agencies, and Asian Development Bank (ADB) mission findings, and is in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and applicable environmental legislation and \nregulations of the Government of Indonesia. \n \nB.  Description of the Project and Environment \n2.  The Project will provide rural water supply and sanitation facilities and services to about \n1,000 communities in 20 districts in the provinces of West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, \nJambi, and Bengkulu. Following a demand-driven, community-based approach, the Project will \nprovide an estimated 1.2 million people with safe drinking water, of which about 0.6 million will \nalso benefit from improved sanitation facilities. The Project will also facilitate capacity building of \nlocal  governments  and  the  communities  themselves,  and  raise  awareness  on  appropriate \nsanitation and hygiene behavior to maximize the investment impact.  \n \n3.  Except for Bengkulu, all project provinces have a distinct dry season which varies from 2 \nto  5  months  and  enjoy  comparatively  high  annual  rainfall  compared  to  other  regions  of \nIndonesia, i.e., 1,500 millimeters (mm) to 3,400 mm. Water resources are generally abundant in \nthe wet season but extreme water shortages are common during the dry season. Water quality \nis  particularly  poor  in  Central  Kalimantan  during  the  dry  season  due  to  a  combination  of \nnaturally  acidic  soils,  and  poorly-planned  developments  in  the  past  involving  broad-scale \nclearing of forest, which has in some cases led to exposure of acid-sulfate deposits. Much of the \nabundant river water in these areas is only usable during the wet season. There is high reliance \non purchasing bottled water for drinking and cooking purposes in Central Kalimantan and \nJambi. Bengkulu has a much shorter dry season and relatively good quality water.  \n \n4.  All four provinces have had relatively small populations due to a lack of development \nuntil recent times. Growth rates in the past 10 years have been relatively high compared to \nIndonesia  as  a  whole  due  to  transmigration.  Kalimantan  stands  out  as  being  particularly \nenvironmentally sensitive. The island has high species richness, particularly for plants, fish, \namphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates compared to Sumatra and other islands. At the same \ntime, it lacks the fertile volcanic soils, which are the basis for Java\u2019s agricultural productivity. \nReflecting the paucity of suitable areas for intensive cultivation, Kalimantan\u2019s population is \nclustered on the more fertile alluvial plains, mostly along the rivers and around the coast. The \nlack  of  viable  development  opportunities  will  make  it  more  difficult  to  find  adequate  and \naffordable water and sanitation improvement solutions for these areas.  \n \n5.  In Bengkulu and Jambi, some of the targeted districts include or adjoin fragile and \nsensitive \u201cprotected areas\u201d in the Kerinci Seblat National Park, which stretches over two other \nprovinces in Sumatra. The natural ecological communities of the Kerinci Seblat area are of \noutstanding  biodiversity  significance.  The  biodiversity  value  of  the  Kerinci  Seblat  area  is \nconsidered to be threatened by any reduction in park area, and by a host of development \n ", "  Appendix 16  51 \npressures  such  as  access  proposals,  encroachment  for  shifting  cultivation  and  cinnamon \nplantations, and logging in the lowland forests. \n \nC.  Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n6.  Potential impacts of the Project and recommended mitigation measures are indicated in \nTable  A16  below.  The  recommended  measures  are  simple  and  easy  to  integrate  in  the \nfeasibility and detailed engineering design studies.  \n \nTable A16: Environmental Impacts and Recommended Mitigation Measures \nImpacts  Recommended Mitigation Measures \nEnvironmental Impacts due to Location:   \n\u2022 Potential water sources may not meet basic water  \u2022  Where feasible, water treatment at source or \nquality standards due to geological or other  household level \nconditions  \u2022  Where treatment is not possible (i.e., due to \nmercury poisoning), water sources will not be \ntapped \nEnvironmental Impacts due to Design:   \n\u2022 Overextraction of water resources, resulting in  \u2022  Regulation of groundwater extraction to maintain a \nlowering of the groundwater table; increasing  level less than or equal to the recharge rate \npumping costs; surface subsidence; and \ndeterioration of roads, buildings, and pipelines \n\u2022 Pollution of groundwater resources through  \u2022  Land use and land management/development \ninfiltration from pit latrines and overflow from septic  controls in recharge area; management of human \ntanks  and industrial waste disposal procedures; watertight \ncasing for groundwater wells; minimum distance of \n10\u201315 meters between groundwater intake and \nnearest source of pollution; construction of dug \nwells and infiltration galleries in straight line across \nthe direction of groundwater flow; ground surface \naround platform sloping away from well for good \ndrainage \nEnvironmental Impacts due to Construction:   \n\u2022 Hazards to workers and nearby residents from  \u2022 Since construction impacts will be of small scale and \nemissions of dust, fumes, noise and vibrations  localized, use standard operating procedures of the \nMinistry of Public Works  as an attachment to any \nformal construction contract \n\u2022 If works are being carried out by communities \nthemselves, provide adequate capacity building on \nwater resource conservation, water quality, and \ngeneral environmental awareness through training \npackage \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nD.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Management System \n7.  The  responsibility  for  implementation  of  the  Indonesian  Environmental  Impact \nManagement  System  (AMDAL)  has  recently  been  decentralized.  According  to  Ministry  of \nEnvironment Decree No. 17/2001, water supply projects require a full environmental impact \nassessment if they involve extraction of more than 250 liters per second (l/s). For projects with \nlower extraction, which would apply to all subprojects under the Project, it is necessary to \nprepare  a  brief  summary  including  a  checklist  and  management  plan  with  proposed \nenvironmental measures to overcome any potential environmental impacts. Given the limited \ncapability of environmental agencies at the district level, an environmental training program will \n ", "52  Appendix 16 \nbe carried out by provincial environmental agencies.1 The training program will cover a 2-day \nworkshop  for  targeted  communities  and  will  involve  a  general  introduction  to  potential \nenvironmental issues that communities may face during planning, design, and implementation \nof subprojects (catchment protection, impacts of illegal logging and mining, etc.), and how to \ncomply with the simplified environmental checklist and management and monitoring plan to \nsatisfy the AMDAL procedures and to ensure that communities understand their responsibilities \nin terms of subproject sustainability. \n \n8.  Villages  submitting  an  expression  of  interest  will  be  prescreened  for  sustainability \nconsiderations,  based  on  a  proposed  screening  checklist.  The  screening  will  identify  the \nsubproject type, scale, location, sensitivity, and the nature and magnitude of potential impacts.2 \nIf the economic development opportunities of a village are limited, and there are also severe \nlocal environment constraints regarding further water resource exploitation, investment in that \nparticular village would face serious sustainability issues beyond the life of the Project and will \nthus not be pursued. The community facilitators will need to ensure that such villages will be \nscreened out before submitting a letter of intent or a Community Action Plan (CAP).  \n \n9.  To ensure that the Project takes full account of its environmental responsibilities, an \nenvironmental  protocol  has  been  prepared  in  draft  form.  Community  facilitators  will  assist \nvillages in the preparation of a standard environmental management and monitoring plan as \npart of the CAP. The standard format will include a description of the activities proposed, and \ncompliance with any applicable guidelines on environmental impacts. All CAPs will be reviewed \nat the district level for their feasibility, technical soundness, and compliance with guidelines \nbefore they are considered for project financing. \n \n10.  Compliance with the individual environmental management and monitoring plan will be \nperiodically checked by the community facilitators, and the districts will aggregate and review \nenvironmental reports and flag them in their quarterly reports. The CPMU will flag them in their \nreports to ADB. \n \nE.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n11.  Public consultation is an inherent part of the Project as it is based on the principle that \ncommunities develop their own solutions to water supply, sanitation, and health. Community \nworkshops, the socioeconomic and health survey, and the technical survey conducted by the \nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance  indicated  the  technical  options  preferred  by  the \ncommunity. During project implementation, each CAP will be publicly displayed and discussed \nin the village so that all stakeholders have ample opportunities to understand and discuss these \nproposals and impacts. \n \nF.  Conformity  of  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Procedures  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental and Social Safeguard Policies \n12.  The environmental assessment and review procedures have been reviewed and found \nto be satisfactory and in conformity with ADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguard policies. \nSpecific project monitoring will be carried out during the project implementation to ensure that \nthe guidelines and environmental management system are adhered to.  \n                                                 \n1  In three of the four project provinces, this agency is referred to as Bapeldalda. \n2  An environmental screening checklist has been developed and is in the Project Administration Memorandum. \n ", "   Appendix 17  53\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \nA.  Introduction \n1.  For this Project, a simplified approach for the economic assessment of rural water \nsupply projects has been developed with the Economics and Research Department of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The approach focuses on time savings as the key indicator of \nbenefits accruing from rural water supply projects. The purpose is to provide a criterion that can \neasily be applied by district staff responsible for the selection of village subprojects and that, if \nmet, provides an assurance that the village-level schemes to be constructed would meet the \nnormal tests of financial and economic viability. The proposed criterion is equivalent to requiring \neach subproject to have an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) greater than 12%. The EIRR \nfor the sum of all water supply facilities would therefore also be greater than 12%. No overall \nEIRR has been calculated separately for the whole Project. \n \nB.  Time Savings Benefits \n2.  One of the most important measurable benefits of improved water supply systems in \nproject villages are the time savings that accrue to households because they no longer have to \ntravel so far to water sources. At present, households travel considerable distances to water \nsources for drinking, cooking, and other in-house uses, especially in the dry season. Activities \nrequiring larger amounts of water, such as bathing and washing laundry, are carried out at the \nwater source. With project implementation, the greater ease of access to water is likely to \nincrease  the  consumption  of  water  at  the  house  and  reduce  the  consumption  at  source, \nalthough where households still have to carry water, some bathing and washing will continue to \ntake place at source rather than at the house. \n \n3.  From the household surveys carried out for the preparation of the initial four subproject \nappraisal reports,1 data are available on water consumption at the house. This is based on \ninformation about the number of water collecting trips made each day by members of the \nhousehold  and  the  average  quantity  of  water  carried  on  each  trip.  The  data  excludes \nconsumption from tap connections and rainwater since there was no way of measuring it.  \n \n4.  Table A17.1 shows the household and per capita2 water consumption in the surveyed \nvillages, averaged by province and across the whole sample. The data are weighted averages \nof wet and dry season consumption. In-house consumption has been normalized to include an \nestimate for tap and rain water, based on the average of consumption from other sources. The \nsurvey provides no data on the actual amount of water consumed outside the house but a level \nof twice in-house consumption is probably a good average, based on knowledge of water use \npractices elsewhere in the country, in order to give an estimate of total water consumption. \nBased on this, the average per capita consumption of water in the four project provinces is \naround 45 liters per capita per day (lpcd). \n                                                 \n1  The surveys conducted in each province covered three villages each in the districts of Landak, Kapuas, Tanjung \nJabung Barat, and Bengkulu Utara. \n2  Per capita estimates are based on average household size per province, ranging from 5.4 in West Kalimantan to \n4.4 in Jambi. \n ", "54   Appendix 17 \nTable A17.1: Household Consumption of Water \n  Liters per Household per Day  Liters per Capita per Day \nDistrict  Outside  Outside \nIn House  Total  In House  Total \nHouse  House \nLandak   66.3   133   199   12.3   25   37 \nKapuas   108.5   217   325   23.6   47   71 \nTanjung Jabung Barat   52.1   104   156   11.8   24   36 \nBengkulu Utara   63.4   127   190   12.9   26   39 \n     Average   72.6   145   218   15.2   30   45 \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance household survey.  \n5.  Table A17.2 shows average collection times, waiting times, and distances traveled to \nsources for each district. These are daily totals, including multiple trips to collect water. The \ndistances and times are weighted averages of dry season and wet season data. The table \nshows that, on average, a household will spend about 8.8 minutes collecting water each day for \nevery 50 meters to the source (or for every 100 meters of the round trip).3  \nTable A17.2: Water Collection per Household per Day  \nDistrict  Collection Time  Waiting Time  Carrying Distance  Collection Speed \n(minutes)  (minutes)  (meters)  (kilometers/hour) \nLandak   19.8   1.0   544   1.65 \nKapuas   27.6   17.2   504   1.10 \nTanjung Jabung Barat   19.0   10.8   221   0.70 \nBengkulu Utara   104.5   1.7   681   0.39 \n     Average   42.7   7.7   487   0.68 \nNote: Times and distances are totals per household per day. Most households make several trips per day to sources. \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance household survey; sample averages.  \n \n6.  The project preparatory technical assistance identified nine technical options for water \nsupply projects, covering piped and nonpiped systems. Capital and operation and maintenance \n(O&M)  costs  have  been  estimated  for  various  system  capacity  levels.  Capital  costs  per \nhousehold range from Rp300,000 for a well with hand pump to Rp3.6 million for abstraction \nfrom a river with slow sand filter treatment. O&M costs start under Rp1,000 per household per \nmonth but are significantly higher for the more sophisticated systems built for relatively small \nnumbers of households.  \n \n7.  Communities will be responsible for selecting the water supply system that best suits \ntheir needs. Costs for both construction and O&M will be a significant factor contributing to their \ndecisions. The application of the economic criterion described below will identify the least-cost \noption for each village. However, villages can opt for a higher-level system that costs more as \nlong as they agree to shoulder the additional costs. \n \n8.  An investment is economically justified if the annual net benefits exceed the annualized \ncosts of the investment\u2014i.e., if it has positive net present value. Supplementary Appendix C \nshows that under certain conditions, this condition is met if the daily time cost savings are \ngreater than the annualized capital costs per day plus the daily O&M costs. The criterion can \nalso be expressed in terms of time savings and costs per trip. This criterion must be met by \neach of the proposed village water supply systems. \n                                                 \n3  Based on the average collection speed of 0.68 kilometers (km)/hour, which translates into 11.3 meters (m)/minute, \nthus 100 m/11.3 = 8.8. \n ", "   Appendix 17  55\n \n9.  The economic analysis is based on an asset life of 15 years for all technical options. The \ndomestic price numeraire is used, with a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.11 applied to the \nforeign exchange portion of costs (mostly pumps) and a standard wage rate factor of 0.8 for \nunskilled labor costs. Local material costs are not adjusted. \n \n10.  The criterion has been applied to the 12 villages surveyed for the original four subproject \nappraisal reports. These villages represent a wide range of situations.

Other Quantifiable Benefits \n12.  Incremental Water. The analysis of water supply projects usually makes a distinction \nbetween incremental water (the additional water provided by the project) and nonincremental \nwater  (the  water  provided  by  the  project  that  replaces  preproject  consumption  from  other \nsources). The volume of incremental water in project villages will depend on present total \nconsumption levels (including consumption both at the house and at source) and the technical \noption selected by villages for implementation. Comparing the household survey data with \nexpected per capita with project consumption levels, it appears that incremental at-the-house \nconsumption is likely to be in the range of 10-40 lpcd. The economic test takes into account all \nfuture in-house consumption, both nonincremental and incremental, and values all in proportion \nto the cost and time savings of the new water source. \n \n13.  Health. Access to improved water supplies will have a beneficial effect on community \nhealth  by  reducing  the  incidence  of  waterborne  and  water-related  diseases.  More  water \nconsumption at the house will help households maintain better sanitary and hygiene conditions \nin their dwellings. Where new, unpolluted water sources will be tapped, or where filter units at \nsource or at household level will be installed, the quality of the water provided will also increase \nsignificantly, thus reducing the risk of consuming contaminated water. Polluted water causes \ndiarrhea, which has a drastic impact on child morbidity and mortality, and on child growth and \nintellectual development over the long term. With lower levels of these diseases, households will \nlose  fewer  days  of  work  (or  education  for  children)  to  ill  health.  Achieving  these  benefits \ndepends  not  only  on  the  new  water  supply  systems  but  also  on  changing  individual  and \nhousehold behavior and practices, and they therefore accrue in a less certain manner than \nfinancial benefits or time savings. Health benefits are not included among the benefits counted \nfor the simplified economic analysis but should be in marginal cases as mentioned above. \n14.  Sanitation. The adoption of improved sanitation facilities will add to the health benefits \nof subprojects. For assessing the subprojects, these additional benefits are not considered \nseparately from the health benefits. \n ", "   Appendix 17  57\n \nD.  Application of the Simplified Economic Assessment for Subprojects \n15.  To apply the economic criterion for the selection water supply schemes for villages \nunder the Project, it is only necessary that a survey be implemented in each candidate village in \norder to estimate the average current in-house consumption per household per day, average \ndistance to water sources, average number of trips per day per household, average time spent \ncollecting water per day, and average time spent waiting at source for water. Together with the \ndesign criteria for the scheme, which will provide an estimate of the future collection distance \nand future waiting time for water at source, this is sufficient to determine time cost savings. \nSample survey sizes for each village should be 20% for villages with less than 100 households; \n10% for villages of 100\u2013300 households; and 5% for villages with more than 300 households. \n \n16.  Capital  and  O&M  costs  for  each  option  have  been  calculated  during  the  project \npreparatory technical assistance and are in Supplementary Appendix C. The annualized costs \ndepend also on the life of the Project, the opportunity cost of capital, and the annual growth rate \nof benefits (for which the annual growth rate of population is used as a proxy). The opportunity \ncost of capital and project life are the same for all villages. Population growth rates are available \nfor each district. Thus annualized capital costs are constant across all the villages in each \ndistrict. These have been estimated and can be provided to district staff to facilitate their \napplication of the economic criterion.4 \n \nE.  Willingness and Capacity to Pay, and Poverty Impacts \n17.  In the 12 villages surveyed, 90% of households expressed a readiness to pay for water. \nAverage  willingness  to  pay  (WTP)  for  a  household  connection  varied  from  Rp30,000  to \nRp134,000. Comparing the average WTP on a monthly basis with O&M costs suggests that \nmost villages would be able to find affordable options, at least as far as O&M costs are \nconcerned, and bearing in mind that at least part of the O&M costs would be provided in kind \nrather than in cash. Only a few options have monthly O&M costs greater than Rp5,000 per \nhousehold. Higher levels of O&M are associated with smaller systems and with pumping rather \nthan gravity flow for piped systems. Sustainability will depend in part upon ensuring that villages \nselect a technical option that is affordable for them to maintain. \n \n18.  To facilitate participation by poor households, the expected monthly O&M charge for \neach household should not be greater than 5% of income for poor households. Since there are \nno published data available on actual incomes of different groups at village level, the simplest \nway to apply this criterion is to identify the scale of system for the proposed options above under \nwhich the criterion is likely to be met in most circumstances. For example, piped systems for \n300 households or less should include public hydrants for poor households, river abstraction \nwith slow sand filter treatment and piped distribution should not be set up for more than 300 \nhouseholds, deep wells with public hydrant should serve at least 150 households in poor and \nvery poor areas, and shallow wells with hand pumps should serve at least five households per \nwell for poor and very poor households. Estimates of O&M costs as a percentage of poor \nhousehold income are shown in Supplementary Appendix C. \n                                                 \n4  A step-by-step explanation for district staff applying the test for the economic criterion is provided in Attachment 5 \nto Supplementary Appendix C. \n ", "58  Appendix 18 \nLAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \nA.  Background \n1.  The Project provides support for community-led efforts in water supply and sanitation in \nsubproject schemes through an intensive community-based participatory process. Of the 20 \nproject districts, none will require any resettlement, but all will require minor land right-of-way \nand asset acquisition. Measures have been incorporated in the project design to adequately \naddress land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) during the course of project implementation. \n \nB.  General Policy \n2.  LAR  issues  will  be  handled  in  accordance  with  national  law  and  relevant  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) policies. ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy (as detailed in the \nADB Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice) requires loan financed projects to \nprepare  (i) a  compensation  policy  framework  and  procedural  guidelines  (CPFPG)  for  the \nsubprojects, (ii) an initial poverty and social assessment for each subproject indicating the \nmagnitude of LAR impacts, and (iii) land acquisition and resettlement plans (LARPs) for each \nsubproject whose initial poverty and social assessment indicates significant LAR impacts.  \n \nC.  Compensation Policy Framework and Procedural Guidelines \n3.  The CPFPG reflects the main LAR preparation and implementation principles. These \ninclude: (i) negative impacts will be minimized as much as possible, (ii) compensation will be \nsufficient to improve or at least restore preproject incomes and living standards of affected \npersons,  (iii) affected  persons  will  be  fully  consulted  on  compensation  options  and  land \nacquisition planning, (iv) asset compensation will be provided at replacement rates, and (v) lost \nasset  compensation  and  rehabilitation  provisions/allowances  will  be  provided  in  full  before \nground  leveling  and  demolition.  ADB  approval  of  a  subproject  involving  significant  land \nacquisition or resettlement will be subject to ADB's approval of the LARP. \n \n4.  The CPFPG stipulates eligibility and entitlements for land and eventual house or income \nlosses, and sets rehabilitation subsidies as follows: (i) permanent agricultural/residential land \nlosses will be compensated in cash at market rates; (ii) temporary land losses will be paid in \ncash at market rates; (iii) house and building losses will be compensated in cash at replacement \nrates, free of demolition expenses and salvaged materials; (iv) crop losses will be paid in cash \nat market rates; (v) relocation expenses covering transport costs will be paid to the affected \npersons; and (vi) compensation for business losses based on tax declarations will be paid to \neach  affected  person  for  each  month  of  interruption  of  business  activities.  The  CPFPG \nestablishes  that  (i) after  subproject  identification  and  completion  of  preliminary  design,  the \ndistrict government will carry out an initial social assessment (ISA) to determine preliminary \nimpact data and the socioeconomic features of the affected persons; (ii) if subproject impacts \nare identified as significant, a full LARP will be prepared; (iii) if impacts are identified as less \nthan significant, a short LARP will be prepared. \n \n5.  The CPFPG also details the main organizational features and tasks of the LAR process. \nThe Government will ensure that there are sufficient funds to cover LAR costs. The Minister of \nHome  Affairs  has  overall  supervisory,  review,  and  financial  responsibility  for  the  LAR. \nCommunity groups will prepare and implement specific LARPs with the full participation of their \nmembers and support of district project management units (DPMUs) for tasks such as asset \nvaluation;  entitlement  delivery;  and  issuance  of  land  acquisition,  demolition,  and  building \n ", "   Appendix 18  59\npermits. Field tasks such as paying compensation, selecting replacement land, and providing \nlivelihood support will rest with village personnel. Subproject schemes, including LARPs, will be \ndesigned and implemented by the community groups based on a community action plan (CAP) \nprepared with the full participation of group members and beneficiary communities. A primer \nsummarizing the CPFPG will be sent to all affected persons. The CPFPG and LARP in Bahasa \nIndonesia  will  be  made  available  at  the  village  office  of  each  scheme  that  requires  land \nacquisition. The same documents in English will be put on the ADB web site. Primers for \nsubprojects in indigenous peoples\u2019 areas will be compiled in local languages. \n \n6.  Both internal and external monitoring will be carried out. The district government will set \nup a monthly reporting system involving the land acquisition and resettlement units. External \nmonitoring will be assigned to an independent institution such as a nongovernment organization \n(NGO) or a local university, and will be carried out on a selective basis for schemes with \nsubstantial  impacts  resulting  from  LAR  and/or  involvement  of  vulnerable  peoples.  External \nmonitoring will be conducted through field visits, and monitoring reports will be submitted to the \nDPMU, which in turn will pass them to the central project management unit (CPMU). At project \nconclusion, the external monitoring agency will prepare a report providing a comprehensive \nevaluation of the LAR program. \n \n7.  Unit compensation rates for items negatively affected by each subproject and detailed \nbudgets  for  impacts  compensation  will  be  provided  in each  LARP.  Cost  estimates  will be \nadjusted annually, based on the inflation rate of the preceding year. \n \nD.  Guidelines for Land and Asset Acquisition \n8.  Land acquisition will be kept to a minimum. No person will be physically displaced from \ntheir  places  of  residence  by  subprojects  financed  under  the  Project.  Subproject  proposals \nrequiring demolition of buildings or acquiring productive land should be carefully reviewed to \nreduce  their  negative  impacts  through  alternative  alignments  or  locations  for  pipes,  wells, \nsanitation facilities, or selection of alternative water sources. \n \n9.  Land or other assets may be acquired through (i) voluntary contribution: in accordance \nwith traditional practices, villagers may elect to voluntarily contribute land or other assets and/or \nrelocate temporarily or permanently from their land without compensation; or (ii) contribution \nagainst compensation: a contributor considered a \u201cproject-affected person\u201d will be eligible for \ncompensation from the village. Voluntary contributions will be closely monitored to ensure that \nno coercion is exercised. In accordance with ADB guidelines, any voluntary donation will be \nconfirmed through oral and written record and verified by the community facilitator or any other \nindependent third party. \n \n10.  These guidelines provide principles and instructions to compensate affected persons \nunder (ii) above, to ensure that all such persons negatively affected, regardless of their land \ntenure status, will be assisted to improve, or at least restore, their living standards, income \nearning, or production capacity to preproject levels. However, if acquired assets are less than \n20% of the total value of the subproject, the village facilitator may dispense with the procedural \nrequirements delineated in para. 12 below. \n \nE.  Compensation Principles \n11.  The village government will ensure that any of the following means of compensation are \nprovided in a timely manner to \u201cproject-affected persons\u201d (ADB loan funds cannot be used for \n ", "60  Appendix 18 \ncompensation): (i) replacement land with an equally productive plot or equivalent productive \nasset; (ii) materials and assistance to replace fully solid structures that will be demolished; \n(iii) replacement of damaged or lost crops, at market value; (iv) cash payment at market value \nfor other noncrop assets; or (v) other acceptable in-kind compensation. \n \n12.  The village government will ensure that all occupants of land and owners of assets \nlocated in a proposed subproject area are consulted. There will be a village meeting to inform \nvillagers about their rights to compensation and options available in accordance with these \nguidelines. The minutes of the village meeting will reflect the discussions held and agreements \nreached, including (i) for any voluntary contribution, the name of the contributor and details of \nthe contribution; and (ii) for land/asset acquisition against compensation, names of project-\naffected persons and details about the nature and level of compensation as summarized in the \nexample below. \n  \nTable A18: Sample Compensation Form \n \nSummary Agreement Reached  Compensation Amount and Type \nAgricultural land (square meters)   \nPlots affected (square meters)   \nHouses/structure to be demolished (units/square meters)   \nTrees or crops affected   \nOther deleterious impact (loss of income)   \nSignatures of villagers, village chief   \nRecord of complaints filed by affected persons   \nMap showing affected area and replacement area   \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n13.  The community facilitator will provide a copy of the minutes to affected persons and \nconfirm with them their requests and preferences for compensation, agreements reached, and \nany eventual complaint. Copies will be recorded in the CAP and be available for review. \n \nF.  Subproject Approval \n14.  In the event that a subproject involves acquisition against compensation, the village \nfacilitator  will  (i) not  approve  the  subproject  unless  a  satisfactory  compensation  has  been \nagreed between the project-affected person(s) and the village government; (ii) not allow works \nto begin until compensation has been completed satisfactorily; and (iii) prepare a compensation \nplan for CPMU and ADB approval if more than 200 persons are affected. \n \nG.  Complaints and Grievances \n15.  All complaints should first be lodged and negotiated within the community group. If no \nsettlement is reached within 2 weeks, the complainant will have 1 month to raise the case with \nthe DPMU, copy to ADB. If this fails to illicit a satisfactory response within 2 weeks, the \ncomplaint may be directed to the district head for a decision. All complaints not solved at the \nvillage level should be copied to the CPMU and ADB. Final appeal is available in the courts. \n \nH.  Verification \n16.  The village minutes and evidence of compensation having been made will be provided to \nthe community facilitator assisting the village, as well as to supervising consultants, auditors, \nand project monitoring and evaluation teams. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20050415141615+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20050401115000+08'00'", "Title": "Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans and Emergency Assistance Grant to the Republic of Indonesia for the Community Water Services and Health Project", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)", "Author": ""}}
