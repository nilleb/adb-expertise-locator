The  Project  is \ncofinanced by the Department for International Development of the \nUnited Kingdom (DFID) and International Development Association \n(IDA). The Project will focus on providing basic health services to \nthe poor and disadvantaged, including ethnic minorities, women, \nand  children,  in  21  provinces.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nfinancing  will  cover  nine  provinces  and  will  improve  access  to \nquality health services by upgrading commune health centers and \ndistrict referral hospitals and enhancing the skills of health care \nservice providers. The Project will support contracting of health \nservices  to  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  in  11  poor \noperational  districts.  The  Project  will  also  support  public  health \npriorities, including national programs for tuberculosis (TB), malaria, \nHIV/AIDS, nutrition, and safe motherhood. The Project emphasizes \nbuilding the capacity of MOH for planning, financing, and managing \nhealth services. \n   \nRationale  Health indicators in Cambodia are among the most adverse in the \nregion. Health infrastructure needs significant strengthening. The \nquality of health services in public and private sectors is poor. \nSkills of health care providers need to be upgraded. Although \nconsiderable progress has been made in the last 5 years, further \nsupport and consolidation are required to improve access and \nutilization  of  health  services,  especially  by  the  poor  and \ndisadvantaged.  The  capacity  of  MOH  to  plan,  finance,  and \nmanage  health  services  remains  weak  and  needs  to  be \nstrengthened. \n   ", "iv   \nObjectives   The objectives of the Project are to (i) increase the institutional \ncapacity to plan, finance, and manage the health sector in line \nwith  the  Health  Sector  Strategic  Plan;  (ii)  develop  affordable, \ngood-quality,  basic  curative  and  preventive  health  services, \nespecially  for  women,  the  poor,  and  the  disadvantaged;  (iii) \nincrease the utilization of health services, especially by women and \nthe poor; and (iv) control and mitigate the effects of infectious \ndisease epidemics and of malnutrition, with emphasis on the poor. \n \nThe Project will have three components: (i) improved delivery of \nhealth services, (ii) support to priority public health programs, and \n(iii) strengthening of institutional capacity. \n \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project is $77 million equivalent. ADB will \nprovide a loan of $20 million equivalent from its Special Funds \nresources, representing 26% of the total project cost. IDA will \nprovide $27 million to cofinance the Project on a parallel basis. \nDFID has agreed with ADB and IDA to jointly finance the Project \nby providing grants of about $22 million (\u00a315 million). ADB will \nadminister $10.4 million of DFID funds using ADB\u2019s guidelines \nand procedures.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB-Administered Part of the Project \n($ million) \n \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  Percent \nExchange Cost  Cost \nADB  9.2  10.8  20.0  57 \nDFID  10.4         0.0       10.4  30 \nGovernment 0.0         4.6         4.6  13 \nTotal  19.6  15.4   35.0  100 \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  DFID  =  Department  for  International \nDevelopment. \n \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of SDR15,154,000 ($20 \nmillion equivalent) from its Special Funds resources, with a maturity \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years and an interest \ncharge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2008 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2007 \nCompletion Date \n   ", "  v\nImplementation  The Department of Planning and Health Information (DPHI) in \nArrangements  MOH will be responsible for coordinating the implementation of \nthe Project. It will be implemented under the overall guidance of a \nHealth Sector Steering Committee headed by the secretary of \nstate. The director general (health) will be the project director. The \ndirector, DPHI, will be the project coordinator, responsible for day-\nto-day  operations  of  the  Project.  Supervised  by  the  project \ncoordinator, several domestic consultants will help monitor and \ncoordinate implementation of the ADB-administered part of the \nProject.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Health \n   \nProcurement  Under  the  ADB-administered  part  of  the  Project,  goods  and \nservices will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement.  Civil  works  in  23  procurement  packages  will  be \nawarded  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding.  Medicines, \nsupplies, equipment, and furniture (10 packages) will be procured \non  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding,  international \nshopping, local competitive bidding, or direct purchase. Health \nservices in 10 operational districts will be contracted to NGOs \nusing procedures acceptable to ADB. \n   \nConsulting Services  Fifteen  international  consultants  (138  person-months)  and  six \ndomestic consultants (360 person-months) will be recruited and \nwill provide services in (i) medical equipment procurement and \nmaintenance,  (ii)  contracting  services  to  NGOs,  (iii)  human \nresource development, (iv) development of the complementary \npackage  of  activities  and  review  of  the  minimum  package  of \nactivity modules, (v) financial management, (vi) procurement, and \n(vii) monitoring and evaluation. A firm will be recruited to prepare \ndetailed designs, undertake necessary surveys, and supervise the \ncivil works. The selection and engagement of all consultants will \nfollow the quality and cost-based selection method in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. \n   ", "vi   \nProject Benefits and  ADB financing of the Project will cover more than 5 million people \nBeneficiaries  (40%  of  the  total  population),  who  will  benefit  from  improved \navailability  and  quality  of  health  services.  In  particular,  project \ninterventions will improve health care coverage for the rural poor, \nwho currently have very limited access to even the most basic \nhealth services. An estimated 4.6 million beneficiaries will come \nfrom  the  rural  population,  accounting  for  92%  of  total \nbeneficiaries. The Project will improve access to quality health \nservice  for  2.5  million  women,  through  strengthened  safe-\nmotherhood  services  and  improved  antenatal  care  and \nemergency obstetric facilities. The Project will also have a major \nimpact on improving the health status of ethnic minorities in the \nprovinces of Mondol Kiri and Rattanak Kiri, which are among the \npoorest in the country. The Project will benefit about 2 million poor \npeople. The poor, who make up 36% of the population in the \nproject area, capture more than 47% of the project benefits. \n \nUsing  very  conservative  assumptions,  the  Project  has  an \neconomic internal rate of return of 17\u201327%. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  project  interventions  involve  almost  no  technical  risk. \nHowever, the implementation of a substantial and jointly financed \nProject poses a serious challenge to the Government\u2019s capacity to \nabsorb and properly utilize available resources. This risk is being \nminimized in the Project through strong capacity-building support, \nlargely  funded  by  DFID  grants,  and  provision  of  consulting \nservices to support procurement and disbursement.  \n \nAnother  challenge  for  the  Government  will  be  to  ensure  the \nsustainability  of  the  facilities  constructed  and  the  services \nintroduced,  especially  after  the  end  of  the  Project.  To  ensure \nproper maintenance of health facilities and equipment, the Project \nwill help MOH prepare maintenance plans and manuals for each \nhealth facility and develop capacity for regular maintenance.  \n   \n \n \n \n ", "  vii", " \n \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Health Sector Support Project,1 and (ii) proposed \nadministration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a grant for the Project to be provided \nby the Government of the United Kingdom. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Sector Performance \n2.  From extremely low levels only 10 years ago, the Cambodian private and public sector \nhealth system has developed rapidly. The achievements of the Ministry of Health (MOH) during \nthis brief period have been encouraging. MOH has developed a national health policy that \nincludes major financial reforms (e.g., budgetary reforms, introduction of user fees) and a \nnational system of primary health care coverage. Polio has been eradicated. MOH has also \nmade substantial progress in other critical areas of public health, including HIV/AIDS prevention \nand  in  the  introduction  of  modern  birth-spacing  methods.  Most  commendably,  MOH  has \nremained open to change and has piloted several innovative approaches for increasing the \ncoverage  and  quality  of  health  services,  including  contracting  of  health  services  to \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) and use of equity funds to support the poor. \n \n3.  Notwithstanding  the  encouraging  progress  in  the  last  decade,  health  indicators  in \nCambodia are still among the worst in the Asia and Pacific region. Average life expectancy at \nbirth is estimated at only 56.4 years\u201454.4 years for men and 58.3 years for women. The infant \nmortality rate is estimated to be 95 per 1,000 live births, while the mortality rate under the age of \n5 is 124, and the maternal mortality ratio is 437 per 100,000 live births (Cambodia Demographic \nand Health Survey 2000). Rates of malnutrition are the second highest in Southeast Asia, with \nan estimated 56% of children under 5 affected by chronic malnutrition. \n \n4.  The country's progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nhas been slow. Infant and child mortality rates appear to have increased in the 1990s. The \ntargets for infant and under-5 mortality rates for 2015 are 42 and 59, respectively, or half the \npresent levels. Given the stagnant and, in fact, slightly increasing trends in these rates in the \npast few years, the achievement of the MDGs will be difficult unless reproductive and child \nhealth services expand considerably. Similarly, the maternal mortality ratio remains high and is \nnot falling as rapidly as required to achieve the target of 150 by 2015. Achieving the goals of \nensuring universal access to reproductive health services and halting and reversing the spread \nof communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis (TB), will also need \naccelerated efforts. \n \nB.  Key Problems and Opportunities \n5.  The health sector faces considerable challenges in the short and medium term. In \nparticular, the following critical issues need to be addressed to expand and sustain future \nprogress in health: \n \n6.  Access, Utilization, and Health Benefits by the Poor. This is the major challenge for \nthe sector.  In the past 5 years, a large number of health facilities have been improved; major \n                                                 \n1 Project framework is in Appendix 1. ", "2   \ninitiatives in national health programs have been undertaken; and service capacities have been \nconsiderably expanded. However, the MOH Health Coverage Plan, which identifies all health \nfacilities required to provide adequate health service coverage in the country, is only 80% \nimplemented. Many poor communes and districts still lack properly equipped health facilities of \nacceptable quality. \n \n7.  Poor Cambodians have not proportionally benefited from health service improvements. \nIn 1998, only 27% of poor children were fully vaccinated compared to 52% of nonpoor children. \nIndividuals from the wealthiest quintile are also more than twice as likely to be admitted to a \nhospital as compared to those from the poorest quintile, despite the fact that the poor have \nworse  health.  Health  care  expenses  are  a  major  cause  of  distress  sales,  indebtedness, \nlandlessness, and poverty. Poor people\u2019s access to health services is constrained by both \nsupply and demand side factors. The lack of physical infrastructure in poor areas, lack of \nresources to pay for health services, and poor knowledge about the need and availability of \npublic health services limit poor people\u2019s utilization of health services. Around 21% of the \npoorest quintile have to travel more than 5 kilometers to seek basic health services, compared \nto 14% of the richest quintile. The quality of services in poor areas is significantly worse than in \nnonpoor areas.  \n \n8.  MOH instituted user charges for health services in 1996 through the Health Finance \nCharter (HFC) in response to the unpredictable informal fees that were being charged in most \nMOH facilities and that had contributed to a marked shift from public to private providers. HFC \nauthorized MOH facilities to charge user fees and established a formula for allocating the \nresulting revenue. HFC exempted the poor from paying user charges. However, studies show \nthat the cost of health services for the poor remains high. User fees, including exemptions for \nthe poor, appear to have worked well at health centers but not at hospitals, where fees are \nconsiderably higher. Hospitals have been reluctant to publicize their fee structures. Even in \nhospitals where user fees have been regularized and are carefully monitored, the exemption \nsystem is not operating effectively and facilities do not have adequate incentives to treat the \npoor. \n \n9.  The quality of health services needs improvement. Many rural MOH facilities have staff \nshortages, which limit access to general and specialized health services. Remote health centers \nare seriously understaffed, in midwifery and reproductive health services. A large proportion of \nhealth providers lack the necessary curative and preventive skills to provide effective health \ncare. The referral system between health centers and hospitals is poorly developed. \n \n10.  The Government piloted the contracting of health services to NGOs under the Basic \nHealth  Services  Project  (BHSP).2  The  results3 of the pilot show that contracting of health \nservices to NGOs can effectively improve access and utilization of health services in rural areas \nin a short time, especially for the poor. This represents an important viable alternative to public \nprovision of health services, particularly in remote areas.  \n \n11.  Communicable  Diseases.  Communicable  diseases  remain  the  main  causes  of \nmortality and morbidity. The rural poor, particularly young children and women of reproductive \nage, are the most vulnerable. TB and malaria are the major causes of morbidity and mortality for \nadults. Cambodia is ranked as a high-burden country for TB (two thirds of the population, or 8 \n                                                 \n2  Loan 1447-CAM: Basic Health Services Project, for $20 million, approved on 20 June 1996. \n3  Bhushan, I; S. Keller; and B. Schwartz. 2002. Achieving the Twin Objectives of Efficiency and Equity: Contracting \nof Health Services in Cambodia. ERD Policy Brief 6. Manila: ADB. ", "    3 \nmillion, are infected). Multi-drug-resistant malaria infects a large number of people, especially \nethnic minorities. Although it has been declining in recent years, HIV prevalence is still the \nhighest in Asia, with about 2.8% of the adult population (15\u201349 years) infected. The MDG of \nhalting and reversing the spread of these diseases requires significantly accelerated efforts. \nAcute  respiratory  infection,  neonatal  tetanus,  hemorrhagic  dengue  fever,  and  diarrhea, \nexacerbated  by  malnutrition,  are  the  major  causes  of  child  mortality  and  morbidity.  Three \nquarters of the entire burden of disease is preventable through low-cost interventions. \n \n12.  Lack  of  Qualified  Human  Resources.  The  lack  of  trained  health  care  providers \nremains the key constraint in improving the performance of public health providers and provision \nof services to the poor. Public providers will continue to be important sources of health services \nin both public and private sectors. At the same time, the capacity of government resources to \nfinance these providers through the budget will continue to be severely constrained. Appropriate \npersonnel policies and incentive structures need to be introduced to rectify the human resource \nimbalance between rural and urban areas. The MOH Health Sector Strategic Plan 2003-2007 \n(Strategic Plan) identifies human resource development as one of the six key areas of work. \nThe strategy calls for enhancing the skills of the workforce through quality education, expanding \nthe number and skills of midwives, and strengthening workforce planning and management to \nreduce maldistribution and ensure efficient use of human resources. \n \n13.  Limited Institutional Capacity. Poor capacity to effectively plan, manage, and finance \nthe health sector at all levels significantly contributes to the poor performance of basic curative \nand preventive services. Improving institutional capacity is critical for ensuring better use of \nhealth services and increased benefits to the population, particularly the poor. As in other \nsectors in the country, low salaries of civil servants and health care providers imply that the key \npersonnel in MOH have to look for other sources of income and are often not available full-time \nto  fulfill  their  responsibilities.  Establishing  an  effective  incentive  and  salary  structure  is  a \nprerequisite for strengthening the capacity of MOH.  \n \n14.  Several international agencies are supporting the reconstruction and development of the \nhealth sector (Appendix 2). Official development assistance accounts for more than half of the \nconsolidated  public  funding  to  the  sector.  Major  partners  include  ADB,  Department  for \nInternational  Development  (DFID),  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development \n(USAID), Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), Japan International Cooperation \nAgency (JICA), Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), German Agency for \nTechnical Cooperation (GTZ), World Bank, World Health Organization (WHO), and other United \nNations (UN) agencies. International support\u2014chiefly investment for developing infrastructure, \nand technical assistance (TA) for developing policies and processes\u2014has played a critical role \nin developing the sector.  \n \n15.  Within  the  context  of  the  national  development  strategy,  MOH  has  developed  the \nStrategic Plan and Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). To achieve the overall goal \nof  improving  health  status  and  reducing  poverty,  the  Strategic  Plan  identifies  eight  core \nstrategies  in  the  six  priority  areas:  health  service  delivery,  behavior  change,  quality \nimprovement, human resource development, health financing, and institutional development \n(Appendix 3). This plan will form the basis for planning and financing health services and \ndirecting international support during 2003-2007. The Project\u2014jointly financed by ADB, DFID, \nand the International Development Association of the World Bank Group (IDA)\u2014will directly \nsupport the Strategic Plan and fill funding gaps identified in MTEF. The Project is also in line \nwith ADB\u2019s operational strategy in Cambodia, which emphasizes human resource development \nas one of three pillars and identifies the health sector as one of the key sectors. ", "4   \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n16.  The Project will improve health status, especially of women, children, and the poor, in \ntargeted regions of Cambodia. Specifically, the Project aims to \n \n(i)  increase the institutional capacity to plan, finance, and manage the health sector \nin line with the Health Sector Strategic Plan; \n \n(ii)  develop affordable, quality, basic curative and preventive health services for the \npopulation, especially for women, the poor, and the disadvantaged; \n \n(iii)  increase the utilization of health services, especially by women and the poor; and \n \n(iv)  control and mitigate the effects of infectious epidemics and of malnutrition with \nemphasis on the poor and disadvantaged.  \n \nB.  Scope \n17.  Project Area. The Project will help strengthen health services in 21 provinces, support \nnational-level activities for communicable disease control, and strengthen the capacity of MOH. \nADB financing will help to improve services in nine provinces\u2014Kompong Cham, Kompong \nChhnang, Koh Kong, Mondol Kiri, Prey Veng, Rattanak Kiri, Krong Prean Sihanouk, Svay \nRieng, and Takeo. Of these, five (Kompong Cham, Kompong Chhnang, Prey Veng, Svay Rieng, \nand Takeo) were covered under BHSP and will require only some supplementary investments. \nThe additional provinces were selected based on their incidence of poverty and prevalence of \ncommunicable  diseases.  Selection  criteria  and  health  sector-related  information  about  the \nprovinces covered by ADB is in Appendix 4. ADB financing will also cover selected regional and \ncentral  MOH  activities.  IDA  financing  will  cover  12  provinces,  national-level  communicable \ndisease control, and other selected MOH activities. A DFID grant will mostly support national-\nlevel  capacity  building,  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E),  safe-motherhood  activities, \napproaches for improving access of the poor to health services, and contracting of health \nservices to NGOs. A significant part of the DFID grant will be channeled through ADB or IDA. \n \n18.  The Project will be implemented under the overall framework defined in the Strategic \nPlan. Financing needs will inevitably change over the project period as other development \npartners  commit  their  funding.  Therefore,  proposed  investments  will  be  reviewed  annually \ntogether with the Government and other partners to confirm the need for planned investments. \nAs part of the Strategic Plan, MOH together with all development partners and civil society will \nundertake an annual sector review before 31 May every year. These agencies and groups will \nreview sector performance and project progress, and agree upon a 3-year rolling plan, including \na detailed operational plan for the subsequent year (Appendix 5). \n \n19.  The Project has three components. The project design was based on an extensive \nhealth sector review and social assessment, and was developed with active participation of \nNGOs, communities, international agencies working in the health sector and the Government. \n \n1.  Improved Delivery of Health Services \n \n20.  This component focuses on improving health service quality, utilization, and access, \nespecially for the poor, women, and ethnic minorities in 21 project provinces. ADB will finance ", "    5 \nthese  activities  in  the  nine  target  provinces  while  IDA  support  will  focus  on  the  other  12 \nprovinces. Specifically, financing will involve  (i) construction and renovation of health centers \nand health posts, and renovation of referral hospitals; (ii) provision of medical and auxiliary \nequipment to health centers and referral hospitals; (iii) training in the minimum package of \nactivities (MPA) and complementary package of activities (CPA);4 (iv) provision of alternative \nmechanisms for delivery of health services to the poor by contracting of health services to \nNGOs in 11 of the relatively poorer operational districts and establishment of social protection \nfunds; and (v) provision of drug kits, particularly for newly constructed health centers. \n \na.  Building and Civil Works \n \n21.   Under  this  subcomponent,  new  and  renovated  facilities  (including  health  centers, \nreferral hospitals, operational district offices and drugstores) will be developed to meet the \nstandards of MPA and CPA services according to the Health Coverage Plan (HCP). It outlines \nthe health facilities required to provide adequate access to health services. Priority will be given \nto  health  facilities  in  remote  and  poor  areas.  The  Project  will  also  support  a  review  and \nnecessary revision of HCP to account for changes in demographics, road infrastructure, and the \nhealth system since its preparation in 1995.  \n \n22.  The Project will give priority to health centers, which are the first point of access to basic \nhealth care. Based on HCP, the Project will also support smaller health posts in sparsely \npopulated mountainous areas inhabited by ethnic minorities. ADB will finance the construction \nor renovation of 128 health centers and 9 health posts in the nine target provinces. Referral \nhospitals are the first link to provide curative health services to the population and play a major \nrole in helping women with complicated deliveries. ADB will finance the renovation of 14 referral \nhospitals and 10 emergency facilities in referral hospitals across the nine provinces. In these \nhospitals, special emphasis will be given to safe-motherhood facilities. The civil works program, \nwhen completed, will meet HCP standards and ensure that all health centers can adequately \nprovide MPA services, and all referral hospitals, CPA services. \n \n23.  Designs  of  health  facilities  under  the  Project  will  conform  to  MOH  guidelines.  The \ndesigns will provide adequate visual and auditory privacy to the patients and also toilets for \nwomen  and  men.  The  facilities  will  be  simple  and  will  use  indigenous  materials  for  easy \nmaintenance.  All  facilities  will  have  adequate  medical  waste  disposal  units.  A  facilities \nmaintenance plan will also be developed. The Project will support the implementation of the \nmaintenance plan. \n \nb.  Medical and Auxiliary Equipment \n \n24.  The Project will help provide and maintain medical equipment in new and renovated \nhealth centers to provide MPA, and in renovated referral hospitals to provide CPA. Service \nquality will also be improved by providing MPA kits to train staff trainers and health center \npersonnel. As with civil works, this subcomponent will aim to complete HCP and meet the \nrequirements for providing MPA and CPA services. \n \n25.  MOH has developed a list of equipment required to deliver MPA services in health \ncenters. The Project will support the provision of MPA kits, including obstetric equipment, to \neach new health center. MOH is finalizing CPA service guidelines and equipment lists. Three \n                                                 \n4  The MPA is provided at health centers and includes a basic set of preventive, promotive, and out-patient curative \nhealth services. The CPA is provided at referral hospitals and includes appropriate curative care for first referral. ", "6   \nlists of equipment for referral hospitals have been developed: for the basic set of activities at \nreferral  hospitals,  referral  hospitals  providing  major  surgery,  and  the  planned  emergency \ndepartments. The Project will review these lists to ensure that all appropriate equipment is \nincluded and then help provide the kits (including surgical and obstetric equipment) to renovated \nreferral hospitals to fill the shortage of functional equipment and enable the hospitals to deliver \nappropriate CPA. Auxiliary equipment\u2014generators and x-ray machines\u2014will be provided to \nrenovated referral hospitals, and ambulances to five major referral hospitals. \n \n26.  The capacity for equipment maintenance in the Hospital Services Department will be \nstrengthened through TA and training. Procurement and supply of equipment will be closely \ncoordinated with civil works. The Project will ensure that health personnel are trained to use and \nmaintain the equipment and that operational manuals are supplied in the Khmer language. The \nGovernment will provide necessary funds to maintain the equipment. \n \nc.  Training of Health Service Providers \n \n27.  The Project will take a comprehensive approach to the training of health center and \nreferral  hospital  staff  to  deliver  MPA  and  CPA  services.  Training  quality,  relevance,  and \nefficiency will be addressed; the MOH continuing education system strengthened; and priority \nMPA and CPA training courses implemented. Subcomponent activities will include (i) training of \n(a) 70 provincial and 204 district trainers in teaching methods and curriculum content; (b) 100 \nprovincial continuing education coordinators in management; and (c) 8,279 health center staff \nand 4,550 referral hospital staff in the nine target provinces; and (ii) follow-up of trainees. \nWorkers in the most remote areas will be trained to directly benefit ethnic minority populations \nand to impart reproductive health skills. Equal training opportunities will be given to women and \nethnic minorities, especially those working in very remote areas. \n \n28.  MOH has developed 13 MPA training modules under the ADB-supported Basic Skills \nProject5 and commenced a comprehensive program of in-service training to enable health \ncenter staff to deliver these services. The Project will support training of health center staff in the \ntarget provinces in the priority MPA modules, including child health, reproductive health, health \npromotion, and infection control. Training will be based on regular training-needs assessments \nand will reflect priorities identified in the Strategic Plan. Training will be supported by the \ndevelopment  or  review  of  training  curricula  where  needed.  The  Project  will  also  seek  to \nstrengthen systems to monitor and evaluate training, quality control, and accreditation.  \n \nd.  Contracting of Services to NGOs \n \n29.  An operations research pilot of contracting health services to NGOs was found to be \nvery efficient, equitable, and cost-effective in BHSP (Appendix 6). Building on the experience of \nthe  pilot  study,  provision  of  health  services  will  be  contracted  to  NGOs  in  11  operational \ndistricts,  selected  for  their  poverty  levels,  weak  capacity  in  service  delivery,  poor  access, \nremoteness, and ethnic minority concentration. ADB and DFID will jointly finance the contracting \nof services in 10 operational districts, while IDA will support contracting in 1. This support will \nensure quality services in poor operational districts covering about 1.8 million people, including \n800,000 poor, and build MOH capacity to manage and monitor NGO contracts. \n \n                                                 \n5  Loan 1368-CAM: Basic Skills Project, for $20 million, approved on 29 August 1995. ", "    7 \n30.  ADB  and  DFID  will  jointly  finance  extension  of  contracting  in  four  of  the  five  pilot \noperational districts contracted under BHSP: Kompong Cham (Memut), Prey Veng (Pearaing), \nand Takeo (Kirivong and Ang Rokar). Six new operational districts will also be contracted:  \n \n(i)  Ponhea Krek in Kompong Cham Province, Preah Sdach in Prey Veng Province, \nand Rattanak Kiri and Mondol Kiri will be contracted from the second year of the \nProject.  \n(ii)  Both operational districts of Koh Kong Province (Koh Kong and Sre Ambel) will \nbe contracted from the third year of the Project. \n \n31.  Contracting activities include management and monitoring of contracts with contractors, \ndevelopment  and  monitoring  of  performance  contracts  with  the  relevant  provincial  health \ndepartments  (PHDs),  and  a  household  survey  to  evaluate  the  progress  and  outcomes  of \ncontracting. Staff employed under contracting will retain civil service status but will be formally \nseconded by the PHD to the contractor. A manual for contracting NGOs will guide MOH in \nimplementing the subcomponent. The capacity of provincial and district health management \nteams in all the contracted operational districts and provinces will be developed to manage \nhealth services after the termination of contracts and to sustain the achievements made. A \ncommittee on health sector initiatives in the Department of Planning and Health Information \n(DPHI) will monitor the contracting of health services to NGOs and other new service delivery \nand financing initiatives by MOH. \n \n32.  The Project will finance establishment of social protection funds (also called equity \nfunds)  in  17  operational  districts.  These  NGO-managed  funds  will  help  the  poor  pay  for \ntreatment costs incurred for a defined set of catastrophic and chronic health conditions. IDA and \nDFID will finance establishment of these funds in 7 operational districts, while ADB will support \n10 operational districts. \n \ne.  Supplies and Drugs \n \n33.  The Project will finance drugs and supplies required to provide MPA. ADB will finance \nMPA start-up drug kits to new health centers in the target provinces. As women and children \nconstitute the vast majority of patients at the health centers, this support will provide more-than-\nproportionate benefits to this population. MPA start-up drug kits will be provided through the \nCentral Medical Store (CMS). The MPA start-up drug kits contain a 6-month supply of basic \ndrugs and contraceptives, based on average consumption figures. These kits will ensure that \nfacilities become operational immediately upon opening and allow them to determine their \nconsumption and join the routine 3-month ordering cycle through CMS. \n \n34.  IDA funding for this subcomponent will finance activities to strengthen procurement, \nstorage, and testing of drugs and pharmaceuticals. In particular, the Project will help establish a \ncentral drug procurement unit, strengthen the Food and Drug Department, and upgrade the \nNational Drug Quality Control Laboratory. IDA will finance a pilot study on using revolving funds \nfor essential drugs. \n \n2.  Support to Programs Addressing Public Health Priority  \n \n35.  The  Project  will  finance  national  programs  to  control  and  prevent  communicable \ndiseases, including HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB. The Project will also support important public \nhealth activities, including safe motherhood, immunization, and nutrition. This component will fill \ncritical financing gaps in management and inputs for public health priority programs.  ", "8   \n \n36.  The proposed investments will be closely coordinated with the investments by other \ninternational agencies, including the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM); DFID; \nUSAID; and UN agencies. A significant amount of support for priority public health programs is \nalready committed by several agencies. ADB is providing substantial financing for prevention \nand  control  of  HIV/AIDS,6  and  GFATM  and  USAID  recently  approved  large  programs  for \nHIV/AIDS. Therefore, the Project will be the financier of the last resort and ensure that critical \nareas of all priority programs are fully funded. Financing for this component will largely come \nfrom IDA. DFID will support safe-motherhood investments. Recognizing the persistently high \nlevels of maternal mortality, DFID funding will complement the planned investments under the \nProject to ensure a comprehensive response to high maternal mortality. \n3.  Strengthening Institutional Capacity  \n \n37.  The Project will help strengthen institutional capacity in management, planning, and \nevaluation at the national, provincial, and district levels. The support will improve the capacity of \nMOH to undertake health sector reforms in accordance with the Strategic Plan, including the \ncapacity for evidence-based planning, health service management and financing, and M&E. \nThis component will be closely coordinated with other development partners, especially WHO. \nADB financing under this component will support (i) strengthening of management capacity and \nsupervision at the provincial and district levels in the nine target provinces, (ii) capacity for \nworkforce planning and management in MOH, (iii) training capacity at regional and national \nlevels, and (iv) M&E. \n \na.  Health Service Planning and Management Capacity Strengthening \n \n38.  ADB will finance the training of 123 provincial, district, and referral hospital managers in \nthe nine target provinces in health service management, including planning, monitoring, and \nevaluation.  Equal  opportunities  will  be  given  to  competent  women  and  ethnic  minority \nmanagers. The Project will also support and expand the MOH program of supervision, and \nfinance the development of annual provincial and district plans. Community participation in \nhealth service management will be supported through health center committees that equally \nrepresent women and men. \n \nb.  Human Resource Planning and Management Capacity Strengthening \n \n39.  The Project will help strengthen MOH capacity for human resource policy, planning, and \nmanagement  through  a  range  of  interventions.  Functional  analysis  is  the  first  step  in \nrationalizing staff deployment and addressing critical staff needs in rural and remote areas, and \nwill be supported in the first year of the Project. TA will be provided for MOH to use the findings \nto  develop  a  rational  human  resources  policy,  and  prepare  the  second  health  workforce \ndevelopment plan. The Project will support specific strategies to solve staff and skill shortages \nin very remote areas, including the development of a primary nurse training course for the \nnortheastern provinces, with scholarships for participants from communities without adequate \nhealth services. The Project will also help the Government review and improve the incentive \nstructure for health providers working in rural and remote areas. \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2001.

The MOH national training system is the foundation of an effective workforce, and the \nProject  will  help  strengthen  the  system's  management,  coordination,  and  implementation \ncapacity. Activities include the implementation of an accreditation system for training courses, \nmanagement training for selected staff, quarterly meetings of training providers and managers, \nrefresher training for teachers and clinical instructors, and upgrading of the qualifications of key \nnurse teachers to enable them to provide educational and professional leadership. \n \nc.  Monitoring and Evaluation  \n \n41.  The Project will support M&E activities to (i) increase the capacity of key stakeholders to \ndesign  and  implement  policies  and  programs  on  the  basis  of  evidence;  (ii)  measure  the \nattainment  of  sector-wide  improvements  in  managing  resources,  delivering  services,  and \nimproving health status; and (iii) produce required information on project implementation. The \nProject will help build capacity for M&E and undertake specific M&E in line with the Strategic \nPlan. In particular, the support will facilitate monitoring of the health status of, and use of health \nservices by, disadvantaged groups, including women, ethnic minorities, and the poor. The \nProject  will  finance  consulting  services,  training,  consumer  and  household  surveys, \nstrengthening of the health information system through use of information technology, and \nrationalization  of  the  surveillance  system.  Activities  for  annual  reviews  envisioned  in  the \nStrategic Plan and midterm project review will be financed.  \n \n42.  A set of measurable indicators\u2014input, process, output, outcome\u2014has been developed \nfor each strategic priority identified in the Strategic Plan (Appendix 7). Baseline values and \ntargets for these indicators will be agreed upon during the first year of the Project. ADB and \nDFID will jointly finance this subcomponent. \n \nd.  Project Management  \n \n43.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  through  the  existing  MOH  structure.  Domestic \nconsultants will help MOH cope with the increased workload. The Project will help strengthen \nMOH's capacity for procurement, disbursement, and project management. The Project will \nfinance the equipment, furniture, and consulting services required for effective implementation \nand M&E of project activities. An international procurement and disbursement specialist will be \nfinanced for 24 person-months. These consultants will also contribute to longer-term capacity \nbuilding of the planning and budget and finance departments of MOH. Contract staff will support \nvarious MOH departments in project implementation. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates \n44.  The total cost of the Project is $77 million equivalent. The Government has requested \nADB to provide a loan of SDR15.15 million ($20 million equivalent) from its Special Funds \nresources, representing 26% of the total project cost. IDA will provide $27 million for parallel \nproject  cofinancing.  DFID  has  agreed  with  ADB  and  IDA  to  jointly  finance  the  Project  by \nproviding grants of about $22 million (\u00a315 million). ADB will administer $10.4 million of DFID \nfunds using ADB guidelines and procedures. IDA will administer $1.8 million of DFID funds. \nDFID will directly manage the grants to the Government for the remaining $10 million. \n \n ", "10  \nTable 1: Cost Estimates and Sources of Funds  \n($ million) \n \n  Project Component     \nItem  Service  Public   Capacity  Unallocated  Total \n  Delivery  Health  Building     \nADB-Administered Part \nADB  13.85  0.00  4.02  2.13  20.00 \nDFID  7.99  0.00  2.37  0.00  10.36 \nGovernment  3.48  0.00  1.15  0.00  4.63 \nSubtotal  25.32  0.00  7.55  2.13  35.00 \nIDA-Administered Part \nIDA  13.20  9.80  4.00  0.00  27.00 \nDFID  0.60  1.24  0.00  0.00  1.84 \nGovernment  2.26  0.35  0.55  0.00  3.16 \nSubtotal  16.06  11.39  4.55  0.00  32.00 \nDFID-Administered Parta \nDFID  0.00  3.00  4.50  2.50  10.00 \nSubtotal  0.00  3.00  4.50  2.50  10.00 \nTotal  41.38  14.39  16.60  4.63  77.00 \n a DFID will allocate about $4.5 for institutional development (including performance-based incentives) through a \nfirm contracted through a competitive process, and $3.0 million for safe motherhood, for which implementation \narrangement will be designed in 2003. \n \n45.  The ADB-administered part of the Project is estimated to cost $35 million equivalent. \nThe Government will provide counterpart funds of $4.63 million equivalent and DFID will provide \nuntied grants of $10.36 million (Appendix 8). ADB will finance the major part of the capital \nexpenditures for its components while the Government will provide the counterpart funds to \ncover a part of the project implementation cost and capital expenditures as necessary. DFID \ncofinancing will be used to contract NGOs, build capacity of MOH, and M&E. \n \n46.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $20 million equivalent from its Special Funds \nresources to finance 26% of the total project cost and 57% of the ADB-administered part of the \nProject (Table 2). The loan would cover $9.2 million of the foreign exchange cost (including \ninterest on the loan) and $10.8 million equivalent, or 70% of local currency costs. The term of \nthe proposed loan will be 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge \nof 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nSource  Foreign   Local   Total   % \nExchange  Cost  Cost \nADB  9.2  10.8  20.0  57 \nDFID  10.4  0.0  10.4  30 \nGovernment  0.0  4.6  4.6  13 \nTotal  19.6  15.4  35.0  100 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n47.  The provision of financing for the local currency cost is considered justified under ADB\u2019s \nlocal currency financing policy. Cambodia needs a large investment program to rehabilitate and \nupgrade dilapidated health sector infrastructure. The need to generate domestic resources to \nfinance investments to sustain economic growth is well recognized. However, it will take some \ntime before the country can develop the necessary resource base to finance the required level \nof investment without external finance. Under the current circumstances, a large investment-", "    11 \nsavings gap will continue, hindering in particular poverty reduction and human development \nprograms that have a large local currency component. Consistent with ADB policy, a higher \npercentage of local cost financing for this poverty reduction project is thus justified. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.   Project Management \n \n48.  MOH  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  Project.  DPHI  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating  project  implementation.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  under  the  overall \nguidance of a Health Sector Steering Committee headed by a secretary of state. The director \ngeneral (health) will be the project director. The DPHI director will be the project coordinator, \nresponsible  for  day-to-day  operations.  The  project  coordinator  will  be  assisted  by  a  small \nsecretariat and several domestic consultants and contracted staff to monitor and coordinate the \nimplementation  of  the  ADB-administered  part  of  the  Project  (Appendix  9).  Staff  will  have \nexpertise in project management, contracting of health services, management, and human \nresource development, and will liaise directly with the related MOH departments and PHDs, and \nundertake frequent field monitoring.  \n \n49.  Disbursement and procurement for the Project will be done by the MOH Department of \nBudget and Finance (DBF). Procurement of NGO contracting and consulting services will be \ndone  by  DPHI.  To  ensure  adequate  linkages  between  the  technical,  procurement,  and \ndisbursement functions, a working group will be established, chaired by the project coordinator \nand composed of staff from DPHI and DBF. This group will meet weekly to review the status of \nvarious  implementation  actions  and  ensure  close  coordination  among  the  technical, \nadministrative, and financial personnel associated with the Project. \n \n2.  Implementation Schedule \n \n50.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years, from January 2003 to December 2007. \nThe project implementation schedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n  3.  Procurement of Goods and Services \n \n51.  All  ADB-financed  procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. The MOH Procurement Unit will have overall responsibility for procuring goods, \nwith technical guidance from the project coordinator/deputy project director and relevant staff \nfrom DPHI, and support from a firm that will act as civil works manager (CWM). Procurement of \nconsulting services and NGO contracting of health services will be carried out by DPHI under \nthe guidance of the project coordinator. Where the procurement is done by other agencies such \nas provinces, the project coordinator and DPHI staff will ensure that the process follows ADB \nguidelines. A list of indicative procurement packages is in Appendix 11. \n \na.  Civil Works \n \n52.  Most civil works will consist of building health centers and referral hospitals. To allow for \nadequate supervision of construction, and due to the dispersed locations of these structures, \nhealth units will be limited to less than 20 packages each, not exceeding $500,000. As the \nfacilities will be small and scattered, the civil works are unlikely to attract foreign bidders. Hence, \nit is proposed that local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB be employed for \nthese structures. Following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, DPHI will recruit CWM ", "12  \nto  finalize  designs,  develop  the  program  of  works,  develop  bid  documents,  and  help  the \nProcurement Unit in tendering, contracting construction work, and monitoring construction and \nrenovation.  \n \nb.  Equipment and Materials \n \n53.  Procurement of equipment and materials will be done by DBF. Medical equipment and \nsupply packages for health centers and referral hospitals will be procured under international \ncompetitive bidding if the cost of the package exceeds $500,000. Packages under $500,000 \nmay be procured using international shopping, direct purchase, or local competitive bidding. \nDrugs will be procured using international competitive bidding procedures. Office equipment and \nvehicles, estimated to cost less than $100,000, will be procured under international shopping or \ndirect  purchase.  Office  furniture,  motorcycles,  and  bicycles,  estimated  to  cost  less  than \n$100,000, will be purchased using local competitive bidding or direct purchase procedures. \n \n    c.  Consulting Services \n \n54.  International and domestic consultants to help implement the project will be recruited \nfollowing the quality- and cost-based selection method in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other procedures acceptable to ADB for the recruitment of domestic \nconsultants. Fifteen international consultants (138 person-months) and six domestic consultants \n(360 person-months) will be recruited on an individual basis. CWM will be recruited following the \nsimplified technical proposal. The consultants will provide services in (i) medical equipment \nprocurement  and  maintenance;  (ii)  contracting  services  to  NGOs;  (iii)  human  resource \ndevelopment; (iv) development of the CPA modules and revision of MPA modules; (v) financial \nmanagement;  (vi)  procurement  and  disbursement;  (vii)  M&E;  and  (viii)  civil  works  design, \nsurvey, and supervision. DPHI will procure consulting services. Consulting service requirements \nand brief terms of reference are in Appendix 12. \n \n    d.  Contracting of NGOs \n \n55.  Contracts for the provision of health services will be competitively awarded following \nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB. A single organization may bid on any number of \ncontracts, but each bid will be evaluated independently against other bids for the same contract. \nBids will be evaluated based on (i) organizational capacity (expertise and resources to provide \nthe services), (ii) strength of the technical proposal, and (iii) cost. Contractors able to contribute, \nin kind or in cash, from other sources will get additional points, as will international bidders that \nhave a local partner agency, to develop local capacity and a pool of potential Cambodian health \nservice contractors. \n \n56.  Contracts  will  be  implemented  on  the  basis  of  fixed  price,  with  quarterly  progress \npayments  made  contingent  on  satisfactory  contractor  performance.  Contracts  will  specify \nobjectively measurable service delivery goals, a minimal acceptable level of improvement, and \nfinancial penalties that will be incurred if the minimal level is not met. The contracts will be \nawarded only to NGOs from ADB's member countries. \n \n  4.  Advance Action and Retroactive Financing \n \n57.  MOH will take advance action to expedite project implementation, particularly by (i) \nshortlisting firms to carry out engineering design and construction supervision; (ii) shortlisting \nindividual  consultants  for  technical  assignments;  (iii)  inviting  expressions  of  interest  and ", "    13 \ncapability  statements  from  NGOs  for  contracting  of  health  services;  (iv)  providing  1-year \ncontracts to the four existing contractors in Memut, Pearaing, Ang Rokar, and Kirivong following \nADB procedures; and (v) identifying the roles, structure, and functions of the steering committee \nand various MOH departments involved in project implementation. The Project will retroactively \nfinance the 1-year contracts to NGOs working in the four operational districts under BHSP, to \nallow  continuation  of  services  until  the  new  contracts  are  signed.  The  development  and \nfinalization of 1-year contracts will follow procedures acceptable to ADB. In particular, the \nexisting NGOs will be considered only if they are performing satisfactorily and agree to contracts \nbased on the originally negotiated rates with correction for inflation. Retroactive financing will \nnot exceed 10% of the ADB loan ($2 million) and will apply to contracts finalized after 16 August \n2002.  However,  ADB\u2019s  concurrence  in  advance  action  and  retroactive  financing  does  not \ncommit ADB to finance the related expenditure under the Project or to finance the Project. \n \n  5.  Accounts and Auditing \n \n58.  MOH will maintain records and accounts to identify goods and services financed by loan \nproceeds. MOH will follow the Project Accounting Manual issued by the Ministry of Economy \nand  Finance  (MEF)  on  23  June  1998,  and  other  instructions  and  modifications  issued \nsubsequently. MOH will (i) maintain separate accounts for the ADB administered part of the \nProject; (ii) ensure that accounts and financial statements are audited annually, in accordance \nwith sound accounting principles by independent auditors acceptable to ADB; and (iii) furnish to \nADB, not later than 9 months after the close of each fiscal year, certified copies of audited \naccounts and financial statements, and the report of the auditor on these.  \n \n  6.  Disbursement Procedures \n \n59.  Withdrawal of loan proceeds will be in accordance with the ADB Loan Disbursement \nHandbook, of January 2001 and as amended from time to time. The imprest account and \nstatement of expenditure procedures will be used. An imprest account will be established within \n1  month  of  loan  effectiveness  in  a  reputable  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB.  The \nstatement of expenditures procedures will be used to reimburse, liquidate, and replenish the \nimprest  account  for  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $50,000  per  payment.  Second-\ngeneration imprest accounts may be opened in the nine provinces. The ceiling for the imprest \naccount and all second-generation imprest accounts in aggregate will be $2 million. These \naccounts will be replenished through the imprest account on submission of full supporting \ndocuments  for  the  expenditure.  Provinces  will  follow  clear  guidelines  for  procurement  and \ndisbursement as stated in health management agreements between the provinces and MOH. \n \n7.  Reporting \n \n60.  DPHI will prepare project progress reports every 6 months and submit them to ADB \nwithin 1 month of the end of each period. The reports will be prepared in a format acceptable to \nADB, DFID, and IDA, and will include (i) progress made against established targets, including \naspects of quality; (ii) delays and problems encountered, and actions taken to resolve them; (iii) \ncompliance with loan covenants; (iv) proposed program of activities to be undertaken during the \nnext 6 months; (v) expected progress during the succeeding period; and (vi) maintenance and \nrepair activities undertaken on health facilities. Within 3 months of the physical completion of the \nProject, the Government will prepare and submit to ADB a project completion report on the \nexecution of the Project, including the costs and compliance with loan covenants. \n \n ", "14  \n8.  Project Review \n \n61.  The Government, ADB, DFID, and IDA will jointly review the project progress at least \ntwice every year, including once in conjunction with the annual review of the Strategic Plan. \nWhile the Project will be regularly reviewed, the Government and the three cofinanciers will also \nundertake a joint midterm review of the Project during the third year of implementation. The \nmidterm review will (i) examine the scope, design, implementation arrangements, and other \nrelevant issues in light of the Government\u2019s development strategies and the policy framework; \n(ii) examine progress in achieving the measurable objectives of the Project; (iii) identify changes \nsince the time of appraisal relating to sectoral issues and resource management and allocation, \nand reassess their impact with regard to future project implementation and sustainability; (iv) \nassess implementation performance against appropriate projections; (v) review and establish \ncompliance  with  various  loan  covenants;  (vi)  identify  problems  and  constraints;  and  (vii) \nformulate appropriate recommendations for corrective action. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation System \n \n62.  The Project has selected a list of verifiable indicators for M&E. Baseline values for these \nindicators will be estimated using data from the 2002 National Health Survey and the 2000 \nCambodia Demographic and Health Survey. The final values of the indicators will be estimated \nfrom data from a household survey, planned under the Project in 2006. \n \n63.  As part of the sector-wide management, sector performance will be monitored annually, \nbased on an agreed-upon set of indicators collected annually through surveys, studies, and \nservice statistics. Analysis of the indicators will be disaggregated by socioeconomic level, sex, \nand ethnicity, where appropriate and useful. The Project will monitor the environmental impact \nof the interventions by observing waste disposal and by evaluating the water quality of randomly \nselected wells near the referral hospitals renovated under the Project. The final evaluation of the \nProject will be made by an independent firm under the supervision of MOH. Data collection will \nbe carried out by MOH but analysis and reporting will be under the responsibility of the firm. To \nmonitor project indicators, DPHI will have overall responsibility for data collection, analysis, and \nreporting to all interested parties, including ADB. Service delivery and health impact will be \nmonitored through regular reports and routine data collected through the Health Management \nInformation System. Qualitative methods to assess beneficiary satisfaction will be used for the \nmidterm review and at the end of the Project. \n \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits \n64.  Investments proposed under the Project will provide significant benefits to people and \ninstitutions. The Project will improve the coverage and quality of the health system, not only \ndirectly  improving  the  welfare  of  the  beneficiaries,  but  also  contributing  to  prospects  for \neconomic growth, human capital of the poor, and poverty reduction. Poverty and health are \nclosely interrelated, as poverty can lead to health problems while illness often leads families into \npoverty. The Project will strengthen policymaking and governance in the health sector at a \ncritical time as Cambodia accelerates decentralization. The Project will serve as a springboard \nto  strengthen  coordination  and  MOH's  capacity  to  lead  and  institute  reforms  for  efficient, \nsustainable, and equitable health services.   \n ", "    15 \n65.  Improved Coverage. The ADB-administered part of the Project will cover more than 5 \nmillion people (40% of the total population), who will benefit from the improved availability and \nquality of health services. Project interventions will improve health care coverage for the rural \npoor, who have very limited access to even the most basic health services. An estimated 4.6 \nmillion (92%) beneficiaries will come from the rural population. The Project will improve access \nto quality health service for 2.5 million women by strengthening safe-motherhood services, \nimproving antenatal care, and providing emergency obstetric facilities. The Project will also have \na major impact on improving the health status of ethnic minorities in the provinces of Mondol Kiri \nand Rattanak Kiri, which are among the poorest in the country. The Project includes measures \ndesigned to bridge the linguistic and cultural gaps that often hinder ethnic minorities\u2019 access to \nthe health system. By helping expand and strengthen MPA and CPA, the Project will ensure \nthat health centers and referral hospitals have the capacity to provide primary and preventative \nhealth care services. The use of contracting in remote and poor operational districts will bring \nhealth services to deprived areas.  \n \n66.  Poverty Reduction and Increased Equity. The ADB project provinces are among the \npoorest in the country and generally have worse health and nonmonetary indicators of poverty \nthan the national average. Project investments are designed to provide more-than-proportionate \nbenefits to the poor. The poor make up 36% of the project area population but capture at least \n47% of the project benefits. The Project supports the extension of services to the poor by \nconstructing and renovating health facilities, improving providers' skills, and supporting community \nparticipation in rural and remote areas. The Project\u2019s support to contracting of health services in \nremote  and  poorly  served  operational  districts  further  enhances  the  pro-poor  bias  of  the \ninvestments.  The  Project  also  benefits  the  near-poor,  who  make  up  about  40%  of  the \npopulation. One health shock is often sufficient to push an entire household into poverty. The \nProject will also provide a platform for instituting several pro-poor policies in MOH, including \nrationalization  of  user  charges,  pro-poor  health  sector  financing,  mainstreaming  of  poverty \nbased planning and M&E. \n \n67.  Significant Economic Returns. Economic analysis of the project intervention shows \nthat even at conservative assumptions, the Project will have an economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR)  of  27%  (Appendix  13).  Even  when  the  assumptions  regarding  project  gains  are \nextremely pessimistic, the EIRR does not go below 17%. Health service improvements in the \nproject area provide three types of economic benefits to the population: (i) health improvements \nthat lead to better productivity and learning outcomes at school, (ii) reduction in days lost due to \nsickness or health care, and (iii) savings in out-of-pocket expenditure on health care due to \nbetter and more efficient health services. The analysis could not take into account the first \nstream of benefits because of the difficulty in quantifying the gains in health and improvement in \nproductivity. The analysis used data from BHSP to quantify the likely impact of the Project in \nreducing lost days due to sickness and health care and out-of-pocket expenditure. A more \ncomprehensive analysis (including productivity gains) of economic benefits would likely yield a \nsignificantly higher EIRR. \n \n68.  Increased Health System Efficiency. Increased efficiency in service delivery, increased \nstaff knowledge and skills, and improved quality of services will all help provide better value for \nmoney to health care consumers. By contracting health services, the Project will help promote \nappropriate and effective health care and improved, more efficient financing of health services. \nSupport to functional analysis and the Health Workforce Development Plan (HWDP) will help \nremove inefficiencies in the deployment of health personnel. The Project will help increase the \nrelevance and efficiency of the health system at provincial and district levels by building the \ncapacity of managers. Managers will develop skills to better identify specific health needs in ", "16  \ntheir area and to address them within the context of national policy and strategy. Increased \ncapacity at the health centers and operational districts will enable gradual absorption of vertical \ndisease management approaches into the integrated system with considerable cost-efficiency \nsavings. \n \n69.  Strengthened  Health  Sector  Governance.  The  Project  will  help  the  Government \nimprove  the  efficiency  of  resource  allocation  and  increase  cost-effectiveness  in  the  health \nsector. According to Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey 2000, health care resources \nare distributed inefficiently among Government ($2.50 per capita per annum), international \nagencies ($6.30), and private out-of-pocket expenditure ($25.90). Within the health sector, \nprimary  health  care  does  not  receive  its  due  share.  The  Project  seeks  to  rectify  these \ninefficiencies. The Project is Cambodia\u2019s first attempt at sector-wide management in the health \nsector. The preparation of the Strategic Plan is an important first step in setting overall priorities. \nSupport and constant review of the Strategic Plan by all stakeholders under the Project will \nfurther help the process. The Project will support MOH in preparing and monitoring annual plans \nto operationalize the Strategic Plan. TA provided under the Project will enhance MOH\u2019s capacity \nto undertake evidence-based decision making. The Project will strengthen MOH capacity to \nplan, finance and manage the provision of health services. Additional training and TA provided \nat the provincial and district levels will further improve capacity for planning and management at \ndecentralized levels. The Project will also ensure better community feedback into planning and \nmonitoring of health services through consumer surveys and participation of civil society.   \n \nB.  Environmental and Social Measures \n  1.  Environment \n \n70.  The Project will have no significant adverse environmental effect. All large civil works \nentail rehabilitation of existing structures. The new structures are small and not likely to disturb \nthe environment or natural resources. Handling and disposal of hazardous medical waste such \nas syringes and needles will be addressed in the design and operation of the health centers.  \n \n  2.  Social Analysis \n \n71.  The Project does not have any adverse social impact (Appendix 14). A detailed social \nanalysis was undertaken during the project preparation. The results of the analysis were fed into \nthe project design to ensure that disadvantaged populations obtain the optimum benefits from \nthe Project. No land acquisition or resettlement is planned under the Project. New structures will \nbe built on government land already allocated for existing health facilities. Some social issues \naddressed by the project design are as follows: \n \na.  Poverty \n \n72.  The project design specifically addresses the constraints often faced by the poor on \nseeking health care services. The Project will (i) focus on primary health care, which provides \nmore-than-proportionate benefits to the poor; (ii) invest largely in rural health facilities used by \nthe poor; (iii) focus on prevention and treatment of common communicable diseases, which \nmostly  afflict  the  poor;  (iv)  contract  out  health  services  in  11  relatively  poorer  operational \ndistricts to NGOs, a strategy that has been shown to benefit the poor; (v) help redress the staff \ngap and skills of providers working in poor areas; (vi) help establish social protection funds, \nwhich will directly help the poor deal with catastrophic and chronic health conditions; (vii) \nencourage participation of the poor in managing health services through support to health ", "    17 \ncenter  committees;  and  (viii)  mainstream  poverty  issues  into  planning,  budgeting,  and \nmonitoring of health services. \n \nb.  Ethnic Minorities \n \n73.  Two project provinces, Mondol Kiri and Rattanak Kiri, are home to a significant number \nof ethnic minorities. Their health status is the most challenging among all target groups due to \ngeneral poverty, difficulties in outreach, lack of health awareness, high illiteracy rates, and, in \nmany cases, culturally insensitive health services. Therefore, the Ethnic Minorities Development \nPlan (EMDP) has been prepared in accordance with ADB guidelines and will be implemented as \npart of the Project (Appendix 15). \n \nc.  Gender \n \n74.  All project subcomponents will target women and girls, who will comprise more than 50% \nof project beneficiaries. One major project priority is safe motherhood and improving the access \nto quality reproductive health care. Since rural women perceive the opportunity cost of using \nhealth services as high, health services must be brought closer to them by improving service \nquality and reduced costs and by generating demand for services. The Project will aim to \nprovide more-than-proportionate training opportunities to women (Appendix 15).  \n \nC.  Risks \n75.  The  project  interventions  involve  almost  no  technical  risk.  The  technologies  and \ntechniques  for  providing  effective  primary  health  care  are  well  understood  and  tested. \nCambodia\u2019s experience in the sector has been highly encouraging, demonstrating feasibility of \nimplementation and sustained commitment of the Government. However, the implementation of \na substantial and jointly financed project poses a serious challenge at the central, provincial, \nand  district  levels  to  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  absorb  and  properly  utilize  available \nresources. Although it has successfully implemented BHSP, MOH still has weak implementation \ncapacity, poorly motivated staff due to low salaries, and a weak financial managerial structure. \nThese risks are being minimized through strong capacity-building support, largely funded by \nDFID, and provision of consulting services to support procurement and disbursement. DFID \nsupport under the Project for an interim strategy as well as a comprehensive solution to the \nproblem of low salaries will also alleviate these risks.  \n \n76.  Another  challenge  for  the  Government  will  be  the  sustainability  of  the  facilities \nconstructed  and  the  services  introduced,  especially  after  the  Project  ends.  Financial \nsustainability of the investments is contingent on the continued provision of an adequate budget \nfor the health sector, which the Government has been able to increase in recent years. Its ability \nto do so in the future depends on making better macroeconomic and fiscal progress. To ensure \nproper  maintenance  of  health  facilities  and  equipment,  the  Project  will  help  MOH  prepare \nmaintenance plans for all health facilities. The Government has assured that it will at least \nmaintain the proportion of the national budget currently allocated to the health sector and \nsufficiently increase the budget for maintenance for equipment and health facilities. \n \n77.  The  model  of  contracting  out  services  has  been  tested  in  Cambodia  and  showed \nimpressive results in the pilot districts. The risks in the Project relate to both the capacity of this \nmodel to work on a larger scale \u2013 a province rather than an operational district, and to the \nchances that any improvements achieved will not be sustained once the externally supported \ncontract  ends.  These  risks  have  been  minimized  through  intensive  consultations  with ", "18  \npolicymakers at provincial and national levels and modifying the design of the model to include \nan exit strategy. \n \n78.  With  elections  in  Cambodia  scheduled  for  July  2003,  it  is  likely  that  there  will  be \ndistraction of efforts at senior levels and limited scope for difficult reforms. However, the Project \nhas been designed to use this period to plan and lay foundations for future implementation and \nmost support in this period will be in the form of TA. This will minimize the risk of diversion of \nresources or lack of decision-making. \n \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n79.  The Government and MOH have given the following assurances, in addition to the \nstandard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents: \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n(i)  The Government and MOH will ensure that no later than 30 April 2003 and in each year \nthereafter, an annual review of the health sector is organized. Documents to be prepared \nas the basis for the review will be circulated to ADB, DFID, and IDA no later than 2 \nweeks  before  the  scheduled  review  and  should  include  (a)  a  review  of  sector \nperformance (summarizing sector performance indicators and trends, implementation \nprogress of agreed-upon policy measures, and institutional reforms); (b) a review of past \nprogress and future plans to implement the health sector institutional capacity-building \nplan and the health infrastructure development plan; (c) a procurement audit and details \nof government budget and actual expenditure in the previous year; and (d) a draft 3-year \nrolling plan for health sector development, comprising a detailed description of activities, \ncosts, and sources of funds for the first year. No later than 15 October 2003 and in each \nsubsequent year, MOH will submit for review and comments to ADB, DFID, and IDA the \nfinal version of the annual operational plan approved by MEF. \n \n(ii)  The Government and MOH will ensure that no later than 31 May 2003 and in each year \nthereafter, they will provide to ADB, DFID, and IDA an annual operational plan for the \nhealth sector for the upcoming year. No later than 31 July of each year, the Government \nand  MOH  will  finalize  and  approve  the  3-year  rolling  plan,  including  the  annual \noperational plan, incorporating the suggestions of ADB, DFID, and IDA. \n(iii)  MOH will submit by 30 April 2004 for review and concurrence of ADB, DFID, and IDA \nduring  the  2004  annual  review,  a  plan  to  strengthen  the  administration  of  health \nservices. The MOH health sector institutional capacity-building plan will include a review \nof current and future responsibilities, revised organizational charts, proposed numbers \nand profiles of key staff, and a training plan to develop capabilities. The Government will \nensure that the plan will be implemented in 2004-2007.  \n(iv)  MOH will submit by 30 April 2004 for review and concurrence of ADB, DFID, and IDA \nduring  the  2004  annual  review,  a  health  infrastructure  development  plan  and  a \nmaintenance plan. The health infrastructure development plan will indicate the type of \nhealth facilities proposed to be developed, their locations, the nature of civil works to be \ncarried out, and implications for staffing of the proposed facilities. The maintenance plan \nwill cover buildings, equipment, and vehicles. The Government will ensure that these \nplans are implemented in 2004-2007.  ", "    19 \n(v)  MOH will submit by 30 April 2004 for review and concurrence of ADB, DFID, and IDA \nduring the 2004 annual review, (a) a review of the HWDP (1996-2005) and (b) the \nproposed HWDP for 2005-2013.  HWDP 2005-2013 should take into account the MPA \nand CPA guidelines and the infrastructure development plan. It will propose specific \nmeasures to deploy, manage, and train health providers. It will also identify measures to \nestablish a sector-wide solution for the problem of low salaries for health providers.  \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that (a) its allocation for recurrent expenditures in the health \nsector will be maintained at least at the current rate of 10% of the total recurrent budget, \nand  (b)  actual  salary  and  nonsalary  expenditures  will  increase  to  at  least  90%  of \nallocated funds in FY2003 and FY2004, and to 95% in FY2005 and FY2006.  \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that at least 50% of allocated funds from its budget for the \nhealth sector will have been disbursed by 30 September of each year from FY2003.  \n(viii)  The Government and MOH will ensure (a) starting in 2003, allocation of at least 60% of \nthe new recurrent spending above the previous fiscal year for provincial and district \nhospitals and commune health centers, and for programs that directly target the poor; (b) \nby 30 April 2004, review of exemptions made in various cost-recovery arrangements in \nthe sector, and propose mechanisms to benefit the poor during the 2004 annual review; \n(c) by September 2006, evaluation of various initiatives to help the poor afford health \ncare, including a social protection fund pilot and, if effective and feasible, mainstreaming \nof such schemes in the Government strategy; and (d) allocation of the health sector \nbudget to provinces and districts, and development and subsequent implementation of a \nformula that incorporates, among other things, poverty criteria and disease burden.  \n(ix)  The Government and MOH will ensure that for each fiscal year from 2004 to 2007, \nbudgetary allocation to health education and consumer behavior programs increases by \nat least 10%.  \n(x)  The Government and MOH will ensure that (a) contracted districts receive an MOH \noperating budget at levels comparable to those of noncontracted districts. Operating \nbudget to the contracted districts will be disbursed in lumpsum by MOH DBF to the \ncontractors quarterly; and (b) civil service salaries, drugs, equipment, and consumable \nsupplies to the contracted districts through normal MOH channels are continued. \n(xi)  The  Government  and  MOH  will  ensure  the  implementation  of  EMDP,  prepared  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines,  to  increase  the  quality  of  and  access  to  health \nservices received by ethnic minorities. The Government and MOH will further ensure \nthat the ethnic minorities have equal opportunities to participate in training, recruitment, \nand promotion of health workers.   \n(xii)  The  Government  and  MOH  will  ensure  the  implementation  of  the  gender  strategy \nprepared during the appraisal. They will further ensure that in selecting the participants \nfor all training activities, priority will be given to achieving at least the same proportion of \nwomen trainees as in the overall pool of the targeted staff, with the ultimate goal of \nreaching gender equality in the training, recruitment, and promotion of health workers. \n(xiii)  Although  no  significant  environmental  impacts  were  identified,  the  siting,  design, \nconstruction, rehabilitation, and operation of the health centers and referral hospitals will \nbe implemented in line with ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines. Handling and disposal \nmeasures for hazardous medical waste will be carried out strictly in accordance with the \nprescribed design and operation of the health centers. ", "20  \n(xiv)  Although  no  involuntary  resettlement  is  envisaged,  the  Government  and  MOH  will \nensure  that  before  the  award  of  civil  works  contracts,  the  proposed  works  will  be \nscreened for involuntary resettlement effects to ensure that no losses of land, income, \nhousing, community facilities, and resources occur that would require compensation to \nbe paid in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement. \n(xv)  No later than 30 September 2003, the Government and MOH will propose mechanisms \nto ensure transparent budget management at the central level and at PHDs, operational \ndistricts, and health centers for discussion during the 2004 annual review. \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n \n(i)  The effectiveness of the Loan Agreement will be subject to the Government and ADB \nobtaining from DFID a confirmation that the DFID grant has been approved. \n \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n80.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 15,154,000 to \nthe Kingdom of Cambodia for the Health Sector Support Project from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \npresented to the Board; and \n \n(ii)  ADB administering grant in the amount of $10,360,000 equivalent to be provided \nby the Government of the United Kingdom to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the \nHealth Sector Support Project.  \n \n \n \n                                                                                                              Tadao Chino \n                                                                                                              President \n28 October 2002 ", "  Appendix 1  21\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign summary  Performance targets  Monitoring mechanisms Assumptions and risks \nGOAL          \nImproved health status,  By 2007:     \nespecially women,  \u2022 Maternal mortality ratio reduced by 30%  \u2022 Demographic and  \u2022 Royal Government of Cambodia \nchildren and the poor, in  (437 to 305 per 100,000 women)  health surveys   continues to regard health as a \ntargeted regions  \u2022 Infant mortality ratio reduced by 12%  \u2022 National Health Survey  high priority.  \n(from 95 to 84 per 1,000 live births)  2002 (baseline)   \u2022 Political and civil stability is \n\u2022 Under-5 mortality rate reduced by 12%  maintained. \n(from 125 to 111 per 1,000 live births)   \u2022 Aggregate level of international \n\u2022 Reduction in the differential of under-5  support for health is maintained. \nmortality rate between the lowest income  \u2022 Current annual economic \nquartile and the highest income quartile  growth rate is maintained \nfrom 2.12 to 1.6  throughout project period. \nPURPOSE          \n1.

", "  Appendix 3  29 \nSUMMARY OF THE CAMBODIA HEALTH SECTOR STRATEGIC PLAN 2003\u20132007 \n \n1.  The Ministry of Health (MOH) recently developed its first Strategic Plan, articulating \ngoals, desired health outcomes, priority areas for intervention, and intervention strategies for \n2003-2007. The Strategic Plan was launched by the Prime Minister on 22 August 2002. MOH\u2019s \n5-year strategic goal is to \u201cenhance health sector development in order to improve the health of \nthe  people  of  Cambodia,  especially  mothers  and  children,  thereby  contributing  to  poverty \nalleviation and socioeconomic development.\u201d Goals include reductions in the high infant, child, \nand maternal mortality rates. \n \n2.  Key Constraints. The plan identifies and seeks to address the following: \n \n(i)  low salaries of health staff in the public sector and lack of incentives to work in \nremote areas. While broader public administrative reforms are underway, interim \nstrategies  are  needed  to  improve  the  income  of  government  health  staff  to \nachieve the plan's objectives; \n(ii)  irregular and inadequate flow of government funds. Although the national health \nbudget has increased, access to funds, and, therefore, expenditures, remains \nlow; \n(iii)  high prices, which limit access to services, particularly hospital services, by the \npoor; \n(iv)  poor quality of care in public and private sectors; \n(v)  poor attitudes and practices among service providers in communicating with \nconsumers; \n(vi)  maldistribution of health service providers, especially trained midwives; \n(vii)  inadequate  managerial  capacities  for  monitoring,  evaluation,  supervision, \ndelegation, and evidence-based decision making; and \n(viii)  limited coordination of external financing in the sector. \n \n3.  Priority Interventions. The Strategic Plan identifies the following priority interventions: \n \n(i)  health service delivery: improving coverage and utilization through improvements \nin the public health system and collaboration with the private sector;  \n(ii)  improvement of the weak interpersonal skills of health care providers and their \nresponsiveness to consumer needs, especially of the poor; \n(iii)  improvement of the quality of public and private sector services;  \n(iv)  human  resource  development  in  terms  of  skills  and  effective  deployment  of \npersonnel; \n(v)  improved health financing in the context of a sector that is underfunded and \nsuffers from poor access to agreed allocations; and \n(vi)  institutional development to enable MOH to implement these interventions and \nassociated strategies. \n \n4.  The highest priority intervention is improved health service delivery and coverage, since \nthey will directly reduce morbidity and mortality. The five other priorities are necessary to \nachieve the first, since without changes in the health sector as a whole and MOH as an \ninstitution, the chances of achieving the intended outcomes are limited. \n \n5.  Key strategies to be employed in these intervention areas include \n(i)  improving  coverage  and  access  to  health  services,  especially  for  the  poor, \nthrough appropriate location of health facilities; ", "30  Appendix 3 \n(ii)  strengthening health center delivery of the Minimum Package of Activities;  \n(iii)  strengthening  referral  hospital  delivery  of  the  complementary  package  of \nactivities;  \n(iv)  promoting  public-private  partnerships  to  improve  accessibility,  quality,  and \naffordability of health services;  \n(v)  training  health  providers  to  become  more  responsive  to  consumer  needs, \nespecially of the poor, through sensitization and building interpersonal skills;  \n(vi)  introducing  and  developing  a  \u201cculture  of  quality\u201d  in  the  public  health  sector \nthrough the use of MOH standards; \n(vii)  developing private sector legislative and regulatory mechanisms; \n(viii)  expanding the number of midwives through basic training;  \n(ix)  strengthening the capacity and skills of midwives through continuing education; \n(x)  improving the flow of funds to the health sector through advocacy to increase \nresources; \n(xi)  strengthening financial management through improved budget implementation \nprocedures; \n(xii)  allocating financial resources to improve the accessibility of health services for \nthe poor through alternative health-financing schemes;  \n(xiii)  developing monitoring and financial auditing systems within MOH to ensure that \nfunds are allocated equitably, and used effectively; \n(xiv)  increasing effective decentralization and deconcentration of MOH functions; and  \n(xv)  strengthening MOH management structures, systems, and procedures (including \nfor procurement) to implement all of the above.  \n \nRelationship between the Project Components and MOH Health Sector Strategy \n \nProject Component/Activity  HSS Intervention Area  Relevant HSS Strategies \n1.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) component of the Project covers 9 provinces, while \nthe International Development Association (IDA) component will cover another 11, enabling the \nProject to cover all areas of the country except Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Kandal, where \nhealth status and service indicators are much higher than in the rest of Cambodia.  \n \n2.  The 12 provinces covered by IDA are Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Kompong Speu, \nKompong Thom, Kampot, Kratie, Krong Kaeb, Krong Pailin, Otdar Meanchey, Pousat, Preah \nVihear, and Stung Treng. The nine provinces to be covered by ADB are Kompong Cham, \nKompong Chhnang, Koh Kong, Mondol Kiri, Prey Veng, Rattanak Kiri, Krong Prean Sihanouk, \nSvay Rieng, and Takeo. The rationale for selecting these provinces is as follows: \n \n(i)  Five provinces\u2014Kompong Cham, Kompong Chnnang, Prey Veng, Svay Rieng, and \nTakeo\u2014were covered under the Basic Health Services Project. Continued support \nwill enable the consolidation of the achievements in the previous project and provide \nopportunity to fill the remaining gaps. These provinces are some of the poorest and \nmost heavily populated in Cambodia.  \n \n(ii)  The four additional provinces were selected on the following bases: (i) poor health \nindicators;  (ii)  remote  and  underserved  in  terms  of  public  health  care  capacity \n(Mondol Kiri, Rattanak Kiri, and Koh Kong); (iii) a high poverty profile (Mondolk Kiri, \nRattanak Kiri, and Koh Kong);  (iv) presence of a large proportion of ethnic minorities \n(Mondol Kiri and Rattanak Kiri); (iv) high incidence, and strong possibility of increase, \nof  HIV  infection  (Krong  Prean  Sihanouk  and  Koh  Kong);  and  (v)  compact  and \ngeographically  contiguous  area  to  enable  better  monitoring  and  effective \nimplementation. \n \n3.

An annual health sector review will be established to assess sectoral progress. The \nProject will help organize these sector reviews. The annual health sector review process will \nbring together stakeholders active in the health sector to review progress on agreed-upon key \nissues, against a core indicator set and agreed-upon annual milestones.  The establishment of \nbaselines will be a priority in 2003. The project cofinanciers and other development partners \nhave a broad consensus on a joint review process. The review will reduce the need for time-\nconsuming and costly individual progress reviews by each development partner and improve \nthe sharing of information between stakeholders. \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n2.  The objectives of the joint annual health sector review process are the following:  \n  \n(i)  review the progress in delivering the Health Sector Strategic Plan; \n(ii)  develop a mechanism for joint review and collaboration under the coordination of \nthe Ministry of Health (MOH); \n(iii)  provide an opportunity for policy dialogue and joint consideration of key issues \nand constraints, including issues of equity and sustainability; \n(iv)  identify and agree on main priorities and a limited number of milestones for \nFY2004 and subsequent years; and \n(v)  discuss  the  comprehensive  3-year  rolling  plan  integrating  the  proposed \ncontributions of all stakeholders, and adopt the annual plan comprising planned \nactivities and sources of financing for the coming year.  \n \nB.  Outline of the Process \n \n3.  The annual review will consist of the following activities:  \n \n(i)  an annual technical review that will assess progress and key issues relating to \nthe seven priority strategic areas as outlined in Strategic Plan, and led by the \nGovernment, with appropriate technical assistance (TA); and \n(ii)  policy and planning review meetings, twice a year.  \n \n4.  The annual review will provide information to the annual budget and planning cycle. The \ntiming of the technical review and the policy and planning review meetings will need to be \ncarefully considered to fit in with the Government budgetary and planning cycle to ensure full \nvalue is made of the findings and recommendations.  The report of the findings of the technical \nreview will be made available in advance of the first policy and planning review.  The technical \nreview will be conducted around March every year to allow annual reporting of progress for the \nprevious financial year and policy and planning reviews around June and November, in line with \nthe budget and planning timetable.  An initial consultative exercise could be undertaken to set \nthe first milestones based on a review of baseline data and work plans.  \n \nC.  Annual Technical Review  \n \n5.  To allow an informed judgment on progress in the sector and project, a number of \nrequirements  for  the  annual  health  sector  review  linked  to  planning,  management,  and \nimplementation need to be agreed upon.  These should be in the form of a set of milestones to \nbe achieved by specified times.  ", "  Appendix 5  33 \n \n6.  Examples of annual milestones (to be achieved before the technical review) are the \nfollowing:  \n \n(i)  public expenditure review for the health sector; \n(ii)  annual  health  sector  profile  (report  based  on  the  core  indicator  set  that \ndemonstrates overall progress in the sector against established baselines); \n(iii)  annual independent review of procurement;  \n(iv)  annual workforce plan and annual report (including salary review); and \n(v)  annual financial audit report. \n \n7.  Many  stakeholders  are  involved  in  the  Health  Sector  Support  Plan  2003\u20132007. \nResponsibility for coordination of the various inputs lies with MOH, and the Health Sector \nSteering Committee, chaired by the secretary of state, is proposed to oversee implementation. \nThe wide variety of stakeholders poses a challenge to the establishment of coherent program \nimplementation  that  makes  best  use  of  available  resources.    While  the  existing  informal \nmechanisms  will  be  strengthened,  more  formal  working  arrangements,  including  the \ndevelopment of joint planning and monitoring processes will be developed. \n \nD.  Links with Wider Government Processes \n \n8.  The annual health sector review will bring MOH and its partners together and help link \nhealth work with other government processes. Specifically, the annual review will aim for the \nfollowing:   \n \n(i)  avoid unnecessary duplication due to different reporting requirements of Ministry \nof Economy and Finance and funding agencies; \n(ii)  link up with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) by ensuring that \nhealth, nutrition, and HIV/AIDS objectives, targets, and indicators are consistent \nwith  any  future  poverty-monitoring  framework  and  that  the  annual  review \nfindings, recommendations, and commitments feed into the PRSP annual review; \n(iii)  link up with the Medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) and coordinate with \nthe Government\u2019s planning and budgeting cycle. In particular, the review will \ninclude substantive discussion around the MTEF; and \n(iv)  link up with other crosscutting reforms underway by ensuring that findings and \nrecommendations are fed into the respective ministries, specifically the work on \nsalary reforms and sectoral reforms such as those underway in education. \n \n9.  The joint review will require effective coordination and good organization. A coordination \nteam will thus guide and support the process and ensure that key documents and summary \nreports are produced on time for the main review meeting.  ", "34  Appendix 6 \nCONTRACTING NONGOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS FOR PROVIDING HEALTH \nSERVICES: RESULTS OF THE PILOT STUDY \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  Under the Basic Health Services Project, the Ministry of Health undertook operations \nresearch  on  the  feasibility,  impact,  and  cost-effectiveness  of  contracting  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) to provide health service delivery as an alternative to conventional direct \ngovernment provision of services. The following two models of contracting for health services \nwere  tested,  and  the  experience  of  these  two  models  was  compared  to  a  number  of \nnonintervention areas as controls: \n \n(i)  Contracting out (CO). Contractors had full responsibility for delivery of specified \nservices  in  an  operational  district,  directly  employed  staff,  and  had  full \nmanagement  authority,  and  accountability  for  achievement  of  specific  health \ncoverage targets. The contractor had full management control over resource \nallocation and disbursement. \n \n(ii)  Contracting  in  (CI).  Contractors  provided  only  management  support  to  civil \nservice health staff, with recurrent operating costs provided by the Government \nthrough normal channels. A budget supplement of $0.25 per capita was provided \nout of loan funds. Contractors had full management control over allocation and \ndisbursement of the budget supplement, but were obliged to follow government \nrules  and  regulations  with  respect  to  the  government-provided  resources. \nContractors had management authority over staff but did not directly employ \nthem. \n \n2.  A comparable operating budget supplement was made available to the control areas. \nIntervention and control areas consisted of an entire district, each with a population of 100,000\u2013\n200,000. There were 4 control, 3 CI, and 2 CO districts. \n  \n3.  Evaluation  indicators  were  established  and  baseline  household  and  health  facility \nsurveys  conducted  before  the  intervention.  An  independent  evaluation,  including  repeat \nhousehold and health facility surveys, was conducted in mid-2001, 2.5 years after contractors \ncommenced  work.  All  districts  at  baseline  had  less  than  20%  of  planned  health  facilities \nfunctional and extremely poor health service coverage. The CI, CO, and control groups had \nsimilar socioeconomic status and baseline health service coverage. \n \nB.  Results \n1.  Was Contracting Effective? \n4.  Results  of  the  final  survey  show  that  contracted  districts  consistently  outperformed \ncontrol districts with respect to the predefined coverage indicators. The CO model was more \nhighly performing than the CI model. Table A6.1 summarizes the changes in 11 health service \ncoverage indicators over 2.5 years. \n \n5.  Starting with comparable levels, CO districts increased health service utilization to 1.7 \nper contact per capita per annum, and CI districts to 1.2. Control districts had an annual per \ncapita  contact  rate  of  only  0.8.  CO  districts  witnessed  an  impressive  increase  in  use  of \nreproductive health services. For example, coverage of antenatal care increased by more than ", "  Appendix 6  35 \n400%, but only by 233% in CI districts and 160% in control districts. Success in the coverage of \nchild  health  services  also  followed  a  similar  pattern.  Immunization  rates  increased  in  CO \ndistricts by 158%, in CI districts by 82%, and in control districts by 56%. \n \n2.  Was Contracting Efficient?  \n6.  The final survey measured the productive time lost due to illness by patients and their \ncaretakers. The results showed that on an average, people in CO districts lost about 15% less \ntime on illness and seeking health care compared to control districts. People in CI districts lost \nabout 5% less time due to illness compared to control districts. Comparable data were not \navailable  in  the  baseline  survey  to  assess  changes  in  lost  time  over  the  contract  period. \nHowever, contracted districts had higher utilization of services and still had lower time lost due \nto sickness and health care. This implies that in contracted districts primary health care was \nmore accessible, obviating the need to travel long distances to seek care. These districts also \nhad more efficient and early diagnosis and more rational treatment, which may have reduced \nthe need for hospitalization and shortened the illnesses. \n \n7.  The pilot measured cost-effectiveness of contracting with respect to the delivery of \npredefined health services. While service was more expensive in the contracting than in the \ncontrol districts, it turned out to be more cost-effective when health service outcomes were \nfactored in the evaluation (Table A6.2). A dollar invested through CO yielded about 50% better \noutcomes than in the control districts. Contracting of services appears to be more sustainable \nas well since it had lower recurrent cost, taking into account private expenditures (Table A6.3). \n \n3.  Was Contracting Equitable? \n8.  The evaluation shows that contracted districts not only achieved better health care \nutilization and significant efficiencies, but also provided more than proportionate benefits to the \npoor. Much of the increase in health care utilization in contracted districts was attributable to the \nincreased use of services by households of low socioeconomic status. For example, use of \ncurative health services at district hospitals by the bottom-half socioeconomic group increased \nby 1,096% in CO districts and by 491% in CI districts in 2.5 years. The corresponding increase \nin the control districts was considerably lower at 82%. \n \n9.  While the use of services by the households of low socioeconomic status increased in \ncontracted districts, their actual out-of-pocket-payment for health care utilization, even when \nuser fees were charged by contractors, substantially decreased. Private out-of-pocket health \ncare expenditures by the bottom-half socioeconomic group reduced by up to 70% during the \ncontract period. The reduction in out-of-pocket costs was greater among this population than the \noverall  population,  indicating  successful  targeting  of  the  desired  beneficiaries  and  efficient \ntransfer of subsidies. The out-of-pocket expenditure for the bottom-half socioeconomic group \nwas reduced by $35 per capita, which compares extremely favorably to about $4 per capita per \nyear invested through contracting of services. Clearly, this was achieved through reduction in \nuse of inefficient services and reduction in travel expenditure by providing services closer to \nhome. Control districts showed an increase in private expenditures  (Table A6.4). \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " 1111  111 111   33333 3  33 3  33333      1      .........    ........  . .. ....    334423324    5.1 12221   2 22 3334       5S        .. .. ...     .  ...... ...        13C12T212    M2HH1.21345M12         T    1  P                                  roReuoTCAMMMC    PCCW CCRCCM        ar C CMMAI     naomn  n  CCArEilAPooaaaaeaaPPo    nrantoolojaPi  t  eecNrnmpptppmpPPti nAaBPe  iAAinnnrnoahsnn  ncAactaaaaakinAAg CG iruttrmo /ttrctag rFidttdrroccccfctC eoainsra  er  ataotrsnaaTg r uMaMbyiiiiiaicuenrcagoerItttttdPnlteprgcceiH n yyyynytuutaitn anci fracPieongstt aaAn- mc      tvcvirr  nieEng&uoHoBoooanlddi toe4Kclritaid tnioyane -c teenffffaiNtpa  ucuiCm p&upaoua i   iEg tsfngewnnaontMRnPngpy lei Ilatnprroue  ldHnav eeNig nt dad &eEaascHcTocpa O hbpOainrwn dteit mcrGn ea vinCnluloMr uiaelpttnRta HoDrtKau aga piyagf eiugruOecsdilcln TIlHainvlaosadntTnNdixgun eehpad/itkgcnni aisi Dr iatnmvSlsn alsoOkiaiig ilnSttatgotyeHtgtinTyii seartDiionresOnlosanIMynfoniiTrSfnnisg DvtnpTeUsgi ismcq&nTeug IesmOi pns Nmayt  snAcetaaeLn gpmt HHRNNPPNONPPMPDDDHDDHHHDCea rHHrHRSTGGGIOOPROHRRROPOmcAooPCDDDDHD DRDDDiOOOPPPPccHPHUet y   //ID,AnUU&OO/n DRtCi nnDDt OOTciiIttTCaDP Yp a c it y\n36  Appendix 6 \n \nTable A6.1:Mean Change in Health Service Coverage Indicators \n \nItems   Control  CI  CO \n(%)  (%)  (%) \nAntenatal care  160.1  233.3  401.5 \nTrained delivery  26.0  0.0  0.0 \nFacility delivery  0.0  225.1  142.0 \nAntenatal tetanus immunization  149.1  148.6  400.0 \nFamily planning knowledge (all)  307.4  317.4  599.5 \nFamily planning knowledge (lower 50% Socioeconomic Group  271.0  301.4  559.5 \n[SEG]) \nContraceptive prevalence rate   93.4  104.5  122.6 \nChild immunization  55.7  81.8  158.1 \nVitamin A capsule receipt  (all)  -25.1  18.1  20.9 \nVitamin A capsule receipt  (lower 50% SEG)  -24.1  29.9  23.9 \nIllnesses treated in district health facility (lower 50% SEG)  81.7  490.5  1096.0 \n       \n         Average    99.6  177.3  320.4 \n              \n \n \nTable A6.2: Cost-Effectiveness in Delivery of Health Services  \n \nItems  Control  CI  CO \nAverage percent change   10  177  320 \n  (all coverage indicators) \nAverage total expenditure per  4.65  6.73  10.82 \ncapita  over  2.5  years \nCost-Effectiveness Ratioa  0.21  0.26  0.30 \na  Average % change divided by average total cost per capita over the 2.5-year pilot period. \n \n \n \nTable A6.3: Recurrent Costs of Contracting by Source  \n($) \n \nSource  Control  Contracting-Out  Contracting-In \nPrivate out-of-pocket  24.99  18.17  23.56 \nGovernment/External Funds  1.86  4.50  2.82 \nTotal  26.85  22.67  26.38 \n \n \n \nTable A6.4: Changes in Out-of-Pocket Health are  \nExpenditure by the Lower 50% SEG \n \nItem  Control  Contracting- Contracting-In:  Contracting-In: \nOut  No User Fee  User Fee \n% Change  +7  -70  +36  -40 ", "  Appendix 7  37 \nLIST OF COMMON CORE INDICATORS FOR \nTHE HEALTH SECTOR STRATEGIC PLAN, 2003\u20132007 \nMeans of \nIndicator  \nVerification \nInputs    \nGovernment budget \n  Allocation    \n  1.

Economic Rationale of the Project \n2.  The economic rationale for investing in health in Cambodia is strong, particularly for \nintroducing primary health care. The Project will support the implementation of the Minimum \nPackage of Activities (MPA) and the Complementary Package of Activities (CPA), which are \ndesigned to ensure that the population, particularly the poor, has access to basic, cost-efficient \nhealth services. Included in the MPA are basic interventions such as immunization, antenatal \ncare,  birth-spacing  services,  basic  nutrition  interventions,  and  prevention  and  treatment  of \ncommon  diseases  such  as  tuberculosis  and  malaria.  These  interventions  generate  large \nexternalities and can be provided at low cost.  \n \n3.  Health care is characterized by asymmetrical information on medical interventions; the \nhealth care provider typically knows more about the need and efficacy of treatment than the \nreceiver, especially in Cambodia, where the education level of patients is low and consumers \nare often ignorant about even basic health practices. Publicly provided health services can help \nbridge the gap and provide information about good health practices and alternatives in health \ncare.  Credit  markets  are  weak  in  Cambodia  and  health  insurance  is  nonexistent.  Proper \nadherence to a formal fee system for health care will reduce uncertainty about health care \nexpenditures. Schemes should be established to protect the poor from the burden of health care \ncost.  \n \n4.  The Project will also support training of health workers, particularly health workers in \nremote areas. While training does provide private benefits, in Cambodia these are likely to be \nsmall compared to the public benefits of having better-trained health workers in a remote area. \nSince  the  public  sector  health  care  providers  work  in  the  public  and  private  sectors  and \nconstitute most human resources in health, improved skills of health care providers will benefit \nthe entire health sector. \n \nB.  Economic Benefits of the Project \n1.   Underlying Assumptions  \n \n5.  The assumptions used for the economic analysis of benefits are in Table A13.1. The \nevaluation of the five contracting districts provides an important source of information on the \npotential impact of the Project on the health and well-being of the population.a The base case \nmakes conservative assumptions about the coverage and effect of the Project. To ensure the \neconomic viability of the Project, a sensitivity analysis will show the effect of tightening the \nassumptions on the overall rate of return.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \na\n  Keller, S. and Schwartz, Brad J. 2001.

The Project will have several positive impacts on the population\u2019s health and welfare that \ncan be quantified in economic terms. These can be broadly divided into resource cost savings \nand productivity gains due to the Project. \n \n7.  Resource cost savings represent a reduction in out-of-pocket expenses for health care \nas a result of (i) increased access to health services to reduce transport cost; (ii) more efficient \nand rational diagnosis and treatment to reduce cost of treatment; and (iii) reforms in health \nfinancing to reduce cost of seeking services, especially by the poor. The evidence from the \nongoing Basic Health Services Project (BHSP) shows that carefully designed public health \nprojects can significantly decrease out-of-pocket expenditures for health services along with \nimprovements in health status. The base case under this analysis assumes that out-of-pocket \nspending on health care will be reduced from $22 to $16 per year in contracting districts \n(savings of $6 per person per year) and to $18 per year in noncontracting districts (savings of \n$4 per person per year). This is a conservative assumption since the expected savings are \nmuch larger.   \n \n8.  The  productivity  gains  are  the  result  of  less  time  lost  to  illness  and  increase  in \nproductivity for adults and better learning outcomes for children. Improving the health status of \nthe population will lead to fewer days lost due to illness and fewer days needed to take care of ill \nrelatives  than  without  the  health  interventions  introduced  by  the  Project.  The  base  case \nassumes that in contracting districts, an average of 2.3 days will be gained per capita due to \nmore efficient treatment and better availability of services. In other districts, the gain is assumed ", "  Appendix 13  51 \nto be 0.8 days per person. Again, these base-case assumptions are conservative and below the \namounts observed in BHSP. Time is valued at $0.75 per day for the entire population, based on \nprevailing wages. This value of time is assumed constant for the entire population, whether \npeople work outside the home, study, or work at home, reflecting the contribution that the \n\"nonworking\" population makes to household welfare.   \n \n9.  Initially, as the project commences, beneficiaries will be few. However, with time, their \nnumber will increase. The base case assumes that the first 2 years of the project will see no \nnew beneficiaries. In the third year, 20% of the target population will benefit from the project, \nincreasing to 40% in the fourth year, 60% in the fifth, and 80% in all subsequent years. \nEvidence from the contracting evaluation suggests that contracting starts to have a positive \neffect on the health system within 6 months, so these assumptions are also conservative.  \n \n10.  Numerous studies have shown that improvements in health have a significant effect on \nthe population\u2019s productivity. This is true for people working (in a job, on their own farm, and \ndoing housework) and studying. Few studies have been done in Cambodia on the relationship \nbetween health status and productivity. This analysis, therefore, does not attempt to quantify \nthese gains and only provides conservative estimates based on benefit streams that can be \nquantified in Cambodia.  \n \n11.  Implementing  the  Project  will  require  additional  resources,  particularly  from  the \nGovernment but also from partners in the form of concessionary lending and grants. The \nanalysis assumes that for each dollar spent on investment, $0.15 per year has to be spent as \nrecurrent cost. Training is assumed to lead to an increase of 15% in salaries, which will increase \nrecurrent costs. Contracting is essentially a recurrent cost and the assumption here is that the \ncost will remain constant in real terms. An additional amount is included to cover the cost of the \nadministration of the Project. Finally, the analysis assumes an additional increase in recurrent \ncosts for the purchase of new drugs and supplies. \n \n  2.   Cost, Benefits, and Economic Returns of the Project  \n \n12.  Table A13.2 summarizes the results for the base case and the alternative scenarios. \nEven with these relatively conservative assumptions, the Project yields a return of 27%. The \nreal rate of return is likely to be higher as healthier workers are able to work more productively \nand earn higher wages.  \n \n13.  The low-coverage scenario assumes that the implementation of the project is slower \nthan expected. The fewer-sick-days-saved scenario assumes that the Project does not reduce \nas many days lost due to sickness. The less-cost-savings scenario assumes that the Project is \nnot as successful in reducing out-of-pocket expenses.   \n \nTable A13.2:  Rates of Return under Different Scenarios \nEconomic Internal Rate of \nScenario    Net Present Value \nReturn \nBase Case    27%  $57.7 million \nLow Coverage in the Project    17%  $31.4 million \nFewer Sick Days Saved    24%  $49.5 million \nLess Cost savings     17%  $33.8 million \nNote: Calculations in millions of constant US dollars, at 12% discount rate  \n \n14.  Even under the most pessimistic project outcome scenario, the Project has a positive \nreturn of 17%. Reducing the number of sick days saved has little effect on the overall returns, ", "52  Appendix 13 \nreflecting the low value of time. Of course, as health conditions improve, the value of time will \ntend to increase. More important to the overall economic viability of the Project are the cost \nsavings associated with reforming health finance in Cambodia and improving efficiency in the \nhealth  sector,  underlining  the  Project's  commitment  to  health  sector  reform  and  improving \ndelivery to complement the traditional project focus of providing supply and infrastructure.  \n \n15.  The Project is part of the larger health sector reform process, led by the Strategic Plan \n2002-2007. At this stage, it is not possible to perform an economic assessment of the Strategic \nPlan due to the large number of components that have not been identified and a number of \nactivities that have impacts that are difficult to measure (for example, sector-wide monitoring \nand evaluation). International Development Association (IDA) has undertaken an economic \nanalysis of its components and noted an overall economic internal rate of return of 29%.   \n \nC.   Financial Sustainability of the Health Sector \n16.  The sustainability of the health care system is of serious concern to the Government. \nCambodia is still reconstructing its economy and health care system and, as a result, resources \navailable for all sectors (including health) are limited. Although the health needs of the country \nare great, any investment in the health system must be sustainable with domestic resources. \n \n17.  Cambodia is unusual among Asian countries, with its large share of health spending\u2014an \nestimated 12% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Of this, the largest percentage comes from \nhousehold  expenditures,  at  83%.  The  Government\u2019s  contribution  to  total  health  care  is \nestimated to be 5%, and that of development partners, the remaining 12%. The Government\u2019s \neffort is severely limited by its narrow revenue base, accounting for around 12% of GDP.   \n   \n18.  While the private sector can be an important source of quality in the health sector, most \nstudies in Cambodia suggest that the country\u2019s over-reliance on the private sector has serious \nconsequences on efficiency due to the lack of supervision and regulation. The private sector \nproviders rely heavily on the prescription of inappropriate and poor-quality drugs. Serious equity \nissues also exist, associated with high private costs and a weak social safety net. Health has a \nstrong public-good component that requires government support. \n \n19.  The  health  sector  is  largely  dependent  on  international  support  and  consumers  for \nfinancing. Consumers often have limited information about their health care options. A good \ndeal of international resources go to capacity building and capital expenditures, which do not \ndirectly contribute to basic health care. Estimates are that a basic package of publicly provided \nservices should cost $12\u201324 per capita per year.  \n \n20.  The Government does not have the resources to sustain the health sector on its own. \nWith a budget of $2\u20133 per capita, Government spending is well below the recommended targets \nfor health spending. Given Cambodia\u2019s low income and small revenue base, the country will \nhave to depend on international assistance for a few more years. Cambodia needs to develop a \nstrategy to ensure that the health sector can continue to function with reduced international \nsupport, and a strategy to better target private health care spending to improve the sector\u2019s \nefficiency.  \n \n21.  Primary health care is funded by the Government, user fees, and funding agencies. \nFiscal sustainability analysis assumes the following:  \n ", "  Appendix 13  53 \n(i)   The  economy  will  grow  at  a  moderate  rate  of  5.5%  with  current  trends  in \npopulation growth. This is below the current growth rate and well within the long-\nterm growth rate of Cambodia.  \n(ii)   The Government\u2019s share in the economy will grow moderately following targets \nand reaching about 18.7% of GDP in 2015. The health sector will account for \nabout 10% of total government spending. Some of this government spending will \nbe for administrative costs and higher-level services.  \n(iii)  External financing will drop sharply from 2001 to 2015. Given that donors also \nfinance  capital  spending  and  capacity  building,  only  part  of  donor  financing \nactually supports basic primary health care.  \n(iv)   A small portion of significant household spending on health care is on basic \nprimary health. With time, households will better allocate their resources for basic \nprimary health care.  \n \n22.  With these assumptions, Cambodia will be able to meet the basic primary health care \ntarget of $12 per capita in the year 2010, relying almost entirely on domestic resources. These \nassumptions are quite conservative and Cambodia may be able to reach this target earlier. \nCambodia  already  spends  substantially  more  than  $12  per  capita  on  health  care,  largely \nthrough household financing of low-quality private services. Were this spending better utilized, \nCambodia would already be well above the recommended level. With the long-term increase in \neducation and with improvements in the health care system, household spending will have a \nmore positive impact on health.  \n \nD.  Financial Sustainability of the Project \n \n23.  As discussed in the section on economic costs and benefits, the Project will impact on \nthe Government\u2019s health spending in several different areas. Contracting of health services \nrequires that the Government take over the cost of the contract in the long run. The construction \nof  new  civil  works  and  the  provision  of  equipment  will  require  additional  spending  on \nmaintenance. While these costs are modest, they will require real commitment on the part of the \nGovernment to ensure that the benefits of the investment are not lost.  \n \n24.  The Project is part of a larger health sector reform program, with additional funding from \nDepartment for International Development (DFID) and IDA. It is estimated that the ADB and \nDFID component of the Project will introduce about $4.2 million per year in recurrent costs. \nAssuming that this is one third of the total incremental recurrent costs, about $12.6 million more \nper year will be needed for recurrent costs in 2008. The estimates used in the health sector \nsustainability analysis (section C) show that the Government should see an increase of its \nbudget from $43 million in 2003 to $68 million in 2008. This increase is more than sufficient to \ncover the additional costs introduced by the Project. Although future ADB assistance is likely \nnecessary for the health sector, following current trends, Cambodia is in a good position to \nsustain the proposed investment.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national priority in country  Sector identified as a national priority in country poverty \npoverty analysis?  partnership agreement?  \n   \nYes  The partnership agreement and the National Poverty \nReduction Strategy identify the health sector as a national \npriority. \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia: \n \nA recent participatory poverty assessment shows that poor health is one of the leading causes of poverty. Health \nshocks are one of the key dimensions of vulnerability. One episode of poor health that requires hospitalization is \nsufficient to drive most rural households into poverty. The poor in Cambodia pay a significant share of their income \n(more than 10%) for health services that are generally of low quality. The health status of the poor is also \nsubstantially lower than the national average and their access to health services are less. \n \nThe Project will address all of these concerns by strengthening the public health system in rural and poor areas and \nby financing nongovernment organization (NGO)-provided health services to poor areas with little access to health.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Proposed Classification: Poverty  \nThe Project is national in scope, but will focus its investment in rural areas, particularly in rural areas that have little or \nno access to health care. The project will focus on primary health care, which mainly benefits the poor and the \npopulation with no access to health services. At least 47% of the benefits will accrue to the population living below the \npoverty line. Additionally, an estimated 200,000 of the near poor (those living just above the poverty line) will not fall \nin poverty due to the Project. The contracting of NGOs will be focused in particularly poor areas (including many that \nhave been recently been devastated by floods) and will bring health care to areas that were previously not served or \nwere significantly underserved.  \n \nEthnic minorities, who are a particularly poor and vulnerable group in Cambodia, will benefit from the Project's focus \nin the northeast and from its commitment to train local health workers.  \n \nBenefits to the Poor  Gender Benefits  Benefits to Ethnic Minorities \nComponent 1: Improved Delivery of Health Services, especially for the Poor and Women \n1.1: Buildings and civil works \nImprove quality and access to  2.6 million women will benefit  At least 160,000 people from ethnic \nhealth services for 2.0 million poor  from increased access to health  minorities will benefit from the \nand 2.0 million near poor.   care.  strengthening of health services in \nremote areas.  \n1.2: Medical and auxiliary equipment \nFacilitates the introduction of the  Minimum Package of Activity  Facilitates the introduction of the MPA, \nMPA, covering basic health  (MPA) introduces reproductive  covering basic health services that \nservices that the poor lack.   health as a central component of  ethnic minorities currently lack. \nbasic health care for 1.2 million \nwomen.  \n1.3: Training of health workers in health centers and hospitals  \nApproximately 13,000 health  Women health workers will be  Around 200 health workers will receive \nworkers will be trained in MPA  trained at least in proportion to  additional training in areas with high \nand complementary package of   their number in their system, with  ethnic minority populations.  \nactivity.

Ethnic Minority Development Plan \n1.  The  objective  of  the  Ethnic  Minority  Development  Plan  (EMDP)  is  to  ensure  that \nCambodia\u2019s ethnic minorities will benefit fully from increased access and quality of health care. \nGiven the ethnic composition of Cambodia, EMDP focuses largely on the hill tribesa in the \nprovinces of Mondol Kiri and Rattanak Kiri.  \n \n2.  The Project\u2019s approach to ethnic minority beneficiaries is guided by the 1998 Indigenous \nPeople\u2019s Policy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and by national guidelines on the rights \nof ethnic minorities. Consistent with these guidelines, the Project will work to ensure that (i) \nethnic minorities are not made more vulnerable as a result of the project\u2019s interventions and (ii) \nethnic minorities positively benefit from the project. EMDP is based on ADB\u2019s previous studies \nin Cambodia, including TA 5794-REG: Addressing the Health and Education Needs of Ethnic \nMinorities in the Greater Mekong Subregion, and TA 5953-REG: Capacity Building for Ethnic \nMinorities. EMDP also draws on the joint social assessment supported by the Department for \nInternational Development (DFID) for the partners in the health sector project.b  \n \n3.  Potential  Negative  Impact  on  Ethnic  Minorities.  No  negative  impacts  on  ethnic \nminorities are expected. In Mondol Kiri and Rattanak Kiri, two new health centers and nine \nhealth posts will be constructed. The health posts are designed to serve low-density areas. The \ncivil works proposed to be undertaken under the Project are small and no resettlement is \nexpected.  Evidence  shows  that  hill  tribes  are  receptive  to  health  interventions  if  properly \ndesigned and if implemented by health workers with substantial knowledge about local beliefs.  \n \n4.  The Cham are native Khmer speakers and well integrated into mainstream society. \nWomen  and  men  regularly  interact  with  the  existing  health  system  without  apparent \ndiscrimination or unease. Expanding and improving the health system should not have any \nnegative impact on the Cham.  \n \n5.  Ensuring Proportional Benefits to Ethnic Minorities from the Project. The  hill  tribes \nin Mondol Kiri and Rattanak Kiri are among the poorest groups in the country. Limited access \nand  low-quality  health  services  are  problems  shared  with  other  marginalized  and  remote \ngroups. These limitations will be similarly addressed by the Project for vulnerable Khmer-\nspeaking groups. To the extent possible, the Project will help ethnic minorities by expanding \nhealth services in poor areas through a mainstreaming strategy. EMDP focuses on issues \nspecific  to  ethnic  minorities.  The  most  significant  barriers  they  face  are  those  created  by \ndifferences in language and culture, which will be addressed by the ethnic minority strategy.  \n \n6.  Literacy rates in Mondol Kiri and Rattanak Kiri are less than one third of the national \naverage. Women are even less likely to be literate and speak Khmer. This creates extra barriers \nfor women who are often most in need of reproductive health, birth-spacing, and child health \nservices. Women\u2019s inability to access health services harms the children. \n \n \n                                                 \na\n Another common term is Khmer Loeu (highland Khmer). EMDP will use the term hill tribes to describe the 15 \nindigenous groups in the northeast. \nb\n Helen Pickering. The Health Situation of Ethnic Minorities in Cambodia. June 2002. ", "  Appendix 15  57 \n7.  The mainstreaming strategy will be implemented through the following components of \nthe Project:  \n \n(i)  New and upgraded health facilities and equipment in poor and remote areas will \nhelp improve the quality of health care that ethnic minorities receive (components \n1.1.1 and 1.2.1).  \n(ii)  Developing a maintenance plan will help ensure the sustainability of the health \nsystem, which is a particular concern in remote areas where few alternatives \nexist (components 1.1.2 and 1.2.2). \n(iii)  Equal opportunity will be given to eligible candidates from ethnic minorities in all \ntraining activities (component 1.3 and 3.2.4) \n(iv)  The use of contracting in the remote provinces of Mondol Kiri and Rattanak Kiri \nwill lead to significant improvements in access to health in areas with little or no \nformal health care (component 1.4.2).  \n(v)  Increased community participation in the health system will ensure that basic \nhealth services are responsive to local needs and are culturally appropriate. The \nproject will support the establishment of health center community committees \n(component 3.1).  \n \n8.  The  ethnic  minority  strategy  focuses  on  designing  interventions  that  are  culturally \nappropriate and will improve the access of ethnic minorities to basic health services:  \n \n(i)  Training community-based health workers from Mondol Kiri and Rattanak Kiri will \nensure that the staff that serve the ethnic minority population speak the local \nlanguage and are familiar with the local culture The training program will be \ndesigned to take into account the low initial level of education of ethnic minority \nstudents (component 3.2.5).  \n(ii)  The construction of small, village-based health posts will provide basic services \nto low-density populations. The health posts also permit the local population to \nstaff health services rather than rely on outsiders to staff larger health centers \n(component 1.1).  \n(iii)  The development of guidelines for nongovernment organization (NGO) selection \nfor contracting in Mondol Kiri and Rattanak Kiri will ensure that the NGO will train \nand employ local staff familiar with the ethnic minority languages and cultures \n(component 1.4.2). \n(iv)  The introduction of a formal national and provincial affirmative action plan will \nensure that ethnic minorities help manage the health system (components 3.1.1, \n3.2.1, and 3.2.2).  \n(v)  Community  participation  in  the  management  of  local  health  services  will  be \nensured. For cultural and linguistic reasons, the participation strategy may need \nto be modified to ensure that ethnic minorities (and particularly hill tribes) have an \nadequate voice in the health system. The contracted NGOs in Mondol Kiri and \nRattanak Kiri will develop a culturally sensitive participation strategy for their \ncontracted district.  \n(vi)  An ethnic minority-disaggregated monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system will be \ninstitutionalized in Ministry of Health (MOH) (component 3.3) \n \n9.  Developing the capacity of the Government to monitor the implementation of EMDP is \nessential. As part of the EMDP, the following steps will be undertaken:  \n ", "58  Appendix 15 \n(i)  A focal point for ethnic minority issues will be designated by the provincial health \nservices in Mondol Kiri, Rattanak Kiri, and, if necessary, in other provinces. The \nfocal point will serve as a liaison among the provincial health service, contracted \nNGOs, MOH, and the local population.  \n(ii)  All annual reviews will ensure that the terms of EMDP are met and will discuss \ntheir  progress.  ADB  will  program  a  special  review  mission  to  focus  on  the \nconcerns of ethnic minorities in the third or fourth year of the project.  \n(iii)  The Project will request that ethnic minority-specific questions be included in \nfuture health and living standard surveys to ensure that it is possible to track the \nhealth status of ethnic minorities. ADB will ensure that M&E activities under the \nProject  incorporate  the  concerns  of  ethnic  minorities.  Monitoring  will  be \nqualitative and quantitative.  \n \nB.  Gender Strategy \n \n10.  Women in Cambodia are disproportionately burdened by health problems. Although the \nStrategic Plan focuses on ensuring that the health system will equally benefit men and women, \nspecific actions and investments are needed to realize this intention. The gender strategy is the \nProject's contribution to the commitment of the Government and ADB to improve the health \nstatus of women and ensure their full participation in the health system. \n \n11.  The Project is classified as a gender intervention because of the significant benefits \nthat  women  will  receive.  The  Project  is  built  around  the  Strategic  Plan,  and  stresses  the \navailability of sufficient resources for Minimum Package of Activity (MPA) and Complementary \nPackage of Activity (CPA), which emphasize women's health, particularly reproductive health. \nGiven  the  limited  resources  available  for  health  in  Cambodia,  the  Project  recognizes  that \ninvesting in reproductive health will have a positive impact on the welfare of the population. \n \n12.  Following the Government and ADB strategy, the Project is committed to mainstreaming \ngender concerns. It will support many interventions and reforms that will benefit both women \nand men, including efforts to increase the affordability and access to health services. In addition, \nthe  Project  will  introduce  a  number  of  changes  that  will  target  women  specifically.  The \nimplementation of the MPA will significantly increase access to reproductive health for 1.2 \nmillion women of reproductive age. At least 5,200 female health workers will be trained in the \nMPA and CPA to ensure that more women can be attended to. Many partners are providing \nsignificant support (including through this Project) to the national HIV/AIDS strategy that will also \nbenefit women, who are disproportionately burdened by HIV/AIDS.  \n \n13.  Key to implementing the gender strategy is ensuring that the health system serves the \nhealth needs of men and women. The formal health system has health center community \ncommittees (HCCCs) to involve the community in the management of health centers. The \nHCCC consists of one man and one woman per village covered by the health center. Many \nareas, however, do not have an active HCCC. The Project will help communities establish \nHCCCs where none exist.  \n \n14.  Ensuring Women Benefit Proportionately from the Project. The underlying principle \nof the Project is that women's health concerns should be mainstreamed in the health sector \nthrough a gender mainstreaming strategy. It will attempt to ensure that the health system takes \ninto account the cultural and biological differences between men and women. The Project will \nalso have a gender targeting strategy to ensure that women receive adequate support from the \nhealth  system.  The  Project  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  gender  mainstreaming ", "  Appendix 15  59 \nstrategy.  \n \n15.  It will be implemented through the following as part of the Project:  \n \n(i)  To  ensure  that  women  are  adequately  represented  in  the  health  system,  a \nsignificant number of women health workers will be trained under the project. \nEqual opportunity for women to receive training is essential and the Project will \nensure that women will receive training at least in proportion to their numbers in \nthe health system, with the ultimate goal of at least 40% of trainees being women \nin 2007 (component 1.3).  \n(ii)  The Project will ensure that civil works provide adequate visual and auditory \nprivacy for patients, which is particularly important for women (component 1.1).  \n(iii)  The Project will help establish health center feedback committees (HCFCs) in \ncommunes  where  the  committees  are  not  operating.  HCFCs  provide  equal \nrepresentation to men and women and ensure that their voices are heard in the \nmanagement of local health centers (component 3.1).  \n(iv)  Ethnic minority women are often especially disadvantaged due to their low formal \neducation and contact with the formal health system. The Project will focus on \ntraining  ethnic  minority  women  health  workers,  who  have  the  cultural  and \nlinguistic knowledge to treat ethnic minority women effectively. More than 50% of \nthe trainees in remote provinces will be women (components 1.3 and 3.2).  \n \n16.  The gender targeting strategy will be built into the Project and will serve to improve the \nhealth status of women. In particular the Project will work to accomplish the following:  \n \n(i)  Incorporate  the  MPA  and  CPA  in  the  health  system,  which  will  significantly \nimprove  women's  access  to  reproductive  health  services  and  benefit \napproximately 1.2 million women living in project operating districts (components \n1.2 and 1.3).  \n(ii)  Improve  the  relevance  of  messages  that  encourage  women\u2019s  health-seeking \nbehavior, for themselves and for children (component 3.2).  \n(iii)  Institutionalize a gender-disaggregated M&E system (component 3.3) \n \n17.  ADB  will  work  with  the  Government  and  other  partners  to  ensure  that  the  gender \nstrategy is implemented. The Project will ensure the strategy\u2019s implementation. Annual reviews \nto be conducted jointly with all partners will ensure that the terms of the strategy are met, and a \ndiscussion on its progress will be included in progress reports.
