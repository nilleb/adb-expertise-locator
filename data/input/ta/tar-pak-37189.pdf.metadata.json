The Government of Pakistan (the Government) has requested a technical assistance \n(TA) grant from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the development of strategic \npriorities for water resources management and irrigated agriculture. The TA  was based on a \nfact-finding mission from 6 to 24 April 2004 to Pakistan that held extensive consultations with \nrepresentatives of the Government of Pakistan; the governments of the provinces of Punjab and \nSindh; farmers\u2019 organizations, development partners; and other stakeholders in the irrigation, \nagriculture, and water resources management sectors.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Achievements in Water Resources. Water resources are vital to Pakistan\u2019s economic \nwell-being, and their improved management is vital to poverty reduction. Agriculture represents \n25% of Pakistan\u2019s gross domestic product, employs over 50% of the rural labor force, and \nprovides 60\u201370% of exports. The development of water resources in the Indus Basin for \nirrigated agriculture has been a key source of agricultural and economic growth, and irrigated \nland is responsible for about 80% of agricultural production in Pakistan. Irrigation uses 95% of \nthe developed water supply to support agriculture on 46 million acres of land, or about 82% of \nthe irrigable area. The Indus canal system is the largest contiguous irrigation system in the \nworld and not only supplies agricultural water but is a primary source of rural, municipal, and \nindustrial  water  supply.  Pakistan\u2019s  drainage  network  expels  up  to  8,000  metric  of  saline \nagricultural drainage water along with municipal and industrial wastewater, most of it untreated. \nDevelopment  of  the  water  resources  infrastructure  has  also  included  5,042  megawatts  of \ninstalled hydropower capacity and 19.4 billion cubic meters of storage. \n \n3.  Significant Challenges in the Water Resources Sector. In spite of these impressive \nachievements,  water  resources  and  irrigated  agriculture  in  Pakistan  face  tremendous \nchallenges. Over two thirds of Pakistan\u2019s surface water resources have been developed, leaving \nlimited opportunities for additional sustainable development. Groundwater development has little \nroom for expansion, and its poor management has led to a groundwater overdraft in many \nareas. Soil and water salinity and waterlogging adversely affect agricultural production. A \nburgeoning population will lead to a sharp rise in urban demand, which will outstrip available \nsupply in the next three decades under current consumption rates.  New irrigation canals are \nstill a priority development objective of some government agencies. Surface- and groundwater \nare becoming increasingly degraded, rendering them unfit for further exploitation in many areas. \nSurface water supply is vulnerable because of the high variability of Indus River flows, and \ndrought. Only about 12% of surface water can be stored, and existing storage capacity is being \neroded through sediment deposition, reducing winter water supplies and energy production. \n \n4.  Substantial additional investment is needed to solve many water resources problems \nand good opportunities for storage, hydropower, and other investments still exist. The Pakistan \nPublic Sector Development Plan (PSDP) supports increased development of water resources \ninfrastructure; however, although projects under the PSDP totaled over PRs350 billion in 2003, \nexpenditures were less than PRs5 billion. The PSDP emphasizes the development of  large-\nscale canal and storage projects with long gestation periods, delaying investment returns and \nrequiring significant budget carryforward, which jeopardizes timely project completion, crowds \nout smaller priority investments, and limits financial flexibility. Projects under the PSDP are \nprepared  using  different  evaluation  criteria,  and  little  comparative  analysis  takes  place  to \n                                                 \n1  The TA was included in ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program 2003: Pakistan. Manila. The TA first appeared \nin ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 25 November 2003. \n ", "2  \nprioritize or sequence projects. Water resources management and development in Pakistan are \nsubject to disagreement among provinces and are politically contentious. A clear vision of the \nfuture of water resources and consensus over coherent objectives for their management and \ndevelopment are lacking. \n \n5.  Institutional and Capacity Needs for Policy Development and Strategic Planning. \nPakistan is facing a crisis if profound action is not taken to solve problems and lay the \nfoundation  to  meet  future  needs  for  water  resources  management  and  development. \nInstitutional arrangements for planning are fragmented among various federal and provincial \nbodies and among different water subsectors. No agency has a clear mandate to direct overall \nwater sector planning and integrate the management and development activities of the various \nwater-related institutions. The recent ADB TA supported  development  of  a  National  Water \nSector Strategy (WSS, completed in 2002) and helped the federal Government realize that \nexisting piecemeal institutional arrangements and capacity for strategic planning and policy \nanalysis are no longer adequate and need to be restructured and strengthened.2  Additional \ncapacity  is  needed  to  implement  the  draft  National  Water  Policy  (NWP),  which  is  under \nGovernment review, complements the WSS, and was developed in response to water sector \nchallenges.3  Major  increases  in  infrastructure  investment  in  the  water  sector,  primarily  in \nirrigation, to sustain higher economic growth are needed and anticipated. However, without \nstrong planning and analytical capability and a sound institutional framework to support this \nexpansion, there is a significant risk that investment outcomes will fall short of their potential. \n \n6.  Current State of Reforms in Irrigated Agriculture. Irrigated agriculture receives most \nwater resources investment and uses almost all the developed water supply.  The surface \nirrigation system is aging and some infrastructure is over 100 years old.  Most is in desperate \nneed  of  modernization  and  rehabilitation.  Water  distribution  is  inefficient,  unreliable,  and \ninequitable. Operation and maintenance (O&M) has low cost recovery and suffers from low \nbudgets. Irrigated agriculture has lower yields and returns than those in similar countries. The \nlack of farmer participation, empowerment, and understanding of rights and obligations has \nresulted in little incentive to conserve water, pay water charges, or respond to productive \nopportunities.  There  is  low  accountability  and  little  transparency  in  service  delivery  and \nexcessive  centralization.  While  many  problems  in  the  sector  stem  from  dilapidated \ninfrastructure, systemic institutional change in irrigated agriculture management is needed to \nachieve sustainable productivity gains. \n \n7.  Need to Synthesize Lessons Learned and Develop Strategy. The most notable \nefforts to introduce institutional reforms affecting irrigation have taken place in Punjab and Sindh \nunder  the  National  Drainage  Program  (NDP),4  which  includes  irrigation  and  drainage \nrehabilitation. Although reforms have taken some time to develop, recent experience under the \nNDP  provides  an  important  opportunity  to  gather  lessons  regarding  program  design  and \nimplementation and to identify the best way forward. Little analysis of the recent NDP reforms \nhas been carried out, and there are questions as to the most appropriate approach to irrigation \nreform in Pakistan and to the elements that should be modified in the current programs.5 The \n                                                 \n2  ADB TA 3130-PAK: Water Sector Strategy Study, closed December 2002. \n3  The water sector strategy and national water policy call for an apex body or supporting secretariat to provide \nenhanced analytical support to strategic planning in the water resources sector. \n4  Cofinanced  by  ADB,  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  and  World  Bank.

Manila. \n5  World  Bank.  2003.  Pakistan  Public  Expenditure  Management.  Washington,  DC  (Volume  II:  Accelerated \nDevelopment of Water Resources and Irrigated Agriculture) provides some institutional analysis of the water \nsector, but does focus significantly on the reform lessons from NDP. ", "      3\nimpacts of the reforms on agricultural productivity and the distribution of costs and benefits to all \nstakeholders warrant evaluation. Assessment of the NDP will provide a basis for developing \nimproved programs, increasing productivity in the sector, and guiding future investment. \n \n8.  Sector Activities and External Assistance. Significant external assistance has been \nprovided to the water sector, and ADB has a long investment history in the water sector, with \nover $1.5 billion invested in projects for irrigation, drainage, tube wells, watershed management, \nand flood protection. ADB\u2019s investment in water resources and irrigated agriculture had waned \nrecently because  of concerns over projects' ability to achieve ADB's development objectives \nand the weak progress of reforms. However, completion of the ADB-supported WSS and the \noutputs  from  this  TA,  renewed  Government  dialogue  and  support  for  reforms,  and  the \noverwhelming development need provide a basis and rationale for ADB reengagement with \ninvestment in irrigated agriculture and water resources. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The TA has two components. The first is to develop a  technical assistance program \n(TAP) in collaboration with the Government that is suitable for financing by ADB or other donors. \nThe TAP will include significant capacity development at the provincial and federal levels for \nwater resources management, and will help establish a permanent body to provide strategic \nplanning at the federal level, and investment preparation. Outputs of the first TA component will \nbe individual working papers, a draft TAP proposal with terms of reference, and a national \nworkshop.  \n \n10.  The second TA component will evaluate irrigation rehabilitation and reform experiences \nin Pakistan, primarily under the NDP, to gather lessons and recommend ways to improve \nprograms. This component will provide essential guidance to ADB, other donors, and the \nGovernment to formulate future assistance for irrigated agriculture. TA findings will generate \nprinciples and strategies to assist design and implementation of irrigation rehabilitation and \nreform  for  future  investment  projects,  including  ADB  loans  scheduled  in  2006\u20132009. This \ncomponent will support a sector reform discussion paper and a national workshop. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  Component 1: Preparation of a TAP for Institutional Strengthening and Capacity \nBuilding. The TA consultants will work with the Ministry of Water and Power (MOWP) to \nprepare a TAP to strengthen the institutional framework and to build capacity for strategic \nplanning and policy analysis to improve the management and development of water resources. \nThe TAP will support the building of professional capacity and skills at the federal and provincial \nlevels. The TA component activities will focus on three key areas: (i) water resources analytical \nand  planning  capacity,  (ii)  decision  support  systems,  and  (iii)  institutional  and  legal \narrangements. \n \n12.  The consultant team will work with MOWP and other federal and provincial agencies to \n(i) develop an apex body or secretariat for water resources management policy and planning; \n(ii) define its role, responsibilities, and functions; (iii) develop a work plan for its first 2 years; \n(iv) develop a staffing and capacity development plan using local and international expertise; \nand (v) create a plan to establish and equip the apex body or secretariat office and identify other \nresource needs. The TA will identify options for developing similar arrangements and capacity at \n ", "4  \nthe  provincial  level.  The  TA  will  define  recurrent  resource  requirements,  identify  potential \nrevenue sources, and present alternatives for the most appropriate placement of the apex body \nor secretariat and similar provincial agencies within existing institutional frameworks. \n \n13.  A high-priority activity of the apex body will be to define and establish management \ninformation systems  and tools  for water sector planning, strategy development, and policy \nanalysis. The TA will review existing decision support systems in Pakistan\u2019s water resources \nand irrigation sectors, define needs, assess existing capacity to support a modern water sector \ndecision support system, and generate an approach and strategy to develop this capacity. The \nstrategy  will  define  roles  of  agencies,  institutes,  the  private  sector,  and  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs); prepare a work plan for the apex body or secretariat; and di entify \nrequired technical resources to ensure management information systems capacity. \n \n14.  Appropriate institutional and legal arrangements are critical to sound water resources \nmanagement. The TA will review existing institutional and legal arrangements, along with \nproposals incorporated in the WSS and draft NWP and its background documents. Based on \nthis review, the TA will formulate recommendations designed to strengthen and restructure \ninstitutional arrangements and identify needed legislation in the sector in accordance with the \nNWP and the WSS.  \n \n15.  A key principle on which this TA component is based is intensive consultation among all \nstakeholders to achieve a consensus on appropriate institutional arrangements in the water \nsector at the federal level and their relationship to the provinces. To strengthen this process, the \nMOWP and TA team will organize a workshop(s) to which representatives of all stakeholders, \nincluding the private sector and NGOs, will be invited to participate. \n \n16.  Component 2: Synthesis of Lessons Learned for Irrigated Agricultural Reform and \nRehabilitation and Development of Principles and Strategies. This component of the TA will \ndevelop an irrigation sector reform discussion paper and an ADB strategy paper to guide \ninvestment. The TA team will review and synthesize literature on irrigated agriculture reform \nefforts in Pakistan and relevant international experience to collect lessons learned. The TA will \nconduct semi-structured interviews and focus groups with government officials including the \nMOWP,  planning  departments,  finance  departments,  irrigation  and  power  departments, \ndepartments of agriculture, area water boards, provincial irrigation development authorities, \nfarmers' organizations (FO), farmers, academics, and NGOs. The TA consultants will also \ndevelop and administer a survey of farmers and other stakeholders in areas where reforms \nhave taken place to assess their impacts and recommend ways to improve the reform process \nand irrigation management and O&M in general. \n \n17.  The  TA  will  evaluate  the  following  aspects  of  irrigation  reform  and  rehabilitation \nprograms: (i) the program design process; (ii) capacity development; (iii) O&M; (iv) abiana (water \nfee paid by farmers) issues, cost recovery, and financial sustainability; (v) irrigation system design \nand technical considerations; (vi) agricultural support services and marketing; (vii) water course \nand farm level development; (viii) staffing, institutional frameworks, and enabling legislation; and \n(ix) economic and social impacts. Based on this evaluation, the consultants will prepare a sector \nreform discussion paper for national and provincial review and dialogue. The paper will present \nlessons learned and outline principles and strategies to improve irrigated agriculture, the reform \nprocess, and rehabilitation programs. It will also provide a platform for debate from which a \nvision for irrigation reform leading to improved agricultural productivity in Pakistan can be \ndeveloped.  The  paper  will  guide  government  agencies  and  donors  that  are  developing \ninvestments in irrigated agriculture. The TA consultants will conduct a national workshop that ", "      5\nwill bring together national and international participants to discuss the TA findings, solicit input \nto develop and refine the vision and strategy put forth in the discussion paper further, and \ndevelop a consensus on policy and an action agenda. The TA will provide a strategy paper \nspecifically to guide ADB investment in the irrigated agriculture sector. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $375,000 equivalent, comprising $190,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $185,000 equivalent in local costs. The Government has requested \nthat ADB finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $110,000 equivalent of the local currency \ncost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program. The Government \nwill contribute the remaining local currency cost of $75,000 equivalent in in-kind support. Details of \nthe cost estimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The MOWP will be the Executing Agency for the TA and has agreed to (i) appoint a \ncounterpart TA project director; (ii) select dedicated counterpart staff to work with the TA team; \n(iii) provide data and other information needed to support the TA; (iv) facilitate two workshops; \nand (v) provide logistical support, lodging in field guest houses (if possible), office space in \nIslamabad, three phone lines, and utilities to the TA team. To support the TA, a steering \ncommittee for policy guidance and TA review will be established.  The steering committee will \nbe chaired by the secretary of planning and will be composed of secretary-level officials from \nrelevant national and provincial departments. \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 5 months, from December 2004 to April 2005. A team \nof consultants will provide a total of 8 international and 12 domestic person-months of consulting \nservices in water resources management, irrigation management, decision support systems, \ninstitutional design, engineering, economics and finance, and agronomy (Appendix 3 provides \nthe terms of reference). ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants  and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic consultants. Advance action for recruitment will be taken on a noncommittal basis. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Pakistan for Water Sector Irrigation Development, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n ", "6 Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions  \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nGoal        \n1.
