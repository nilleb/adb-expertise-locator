The Government of Viet Nam has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to help support reforms initiated under the Third Financial Sector \nProgram Loan (FSPL III).1 A fact-finding mission was fielded in Hanoi during 21\u201324 January \n2008 to build on the policy dialogue initiated during the processing of FSPL III to finalize the \nscope and content of the assistance and to obtain the Government\u2019s concurrence with the TA \nimpact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference.2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Continued development of the financial sector is central to sustaining Viet Nam\u2019s growth \nmomentum. Financial sector reform and development is a complex process, requiring time and \ncontinuity to enable the accumulation of incremental changes into substantial outcomes. Both \nthe FSPL III and the present TA are part of a continuing, long-term engagement of ADB with \nfinancial sector development in Viet Nam through TA projects and two program loans (Financial \nSector Program Loan [FSPL I] and Second Financial Sector Program Loan [FSPL II]).3 The \nfinancial sector in Viet Nam until the early 1990s comprised a rudimentary mono-bank system \nwith virtually no capital markets, weak or absent intermediaries, poor infrastructure, and an \ninadequate or missing legal and regulatory framework. ADB has supported the Government \nover the past decade to develop the sector by addressing critical bottlenecks in infrastructure, \nlegal and regulatory structure, and institutional capacities.4 The proposed TA, along with FSPL \nIII, is another milestone in ADB\u2019s sustained support to the financial sector and will build on \nearlier work to help address the need for more effective risk allocation in the economy through \ncapital market development.5 Key issues in further developing the capital markets are assessed \nbelow. \n \nA.  Markets Development \n \n3.  Ineffective Framework for Securities Issuance. Development of deep and liquid debt \nmarkets in Viet Nam is constrained by lack of a systematic framework for debt issuance. The \nprimary market for government securities is highly segmented because of multiple channels and \nmethods of issue, and there are too many issues relative to the total volume of debt. An \nexcessive number of issuances is also accompanied by lack of adequate predictability about the \nschedule  of  debt  issuance,  constraining  planning  by  market  participants.  The  Government \nseeks to control the quantity and price of debt issued simultaneously by imposing interest \nceilings on each issuance. A system of primary dealers with market making responsibilities is \nyet to be established, which limits secondary market liquidity. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Program \nCluster and Loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Third Financial Sector Program Loan (Subprogram \n1). Manila (approved on 6 December). \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 February 2008. \n3  ADB. 1996. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nSocialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Financial  Sector  Program.  Manila;  and  ADB.  2002.  Report  and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Program Loan Cluster to the Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam for the Second Financial Sector Program. Manila. \n4  FSPL I facilitated laying down the legal and regulatory foundations of a commercialized banking sector; and \ndevelopment of diverse institutions, instruments, and markets. FSPL II promoted development of the nonbank \nfinancial sector by strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework for the insurance industry; developing a \nlegal framework for the leasing industry; introducing an anti-money laundering regime; and strengthening financial \ninfrastructure such as depository, payment, and settlement systems, accounting, and auditing. \n5   ADB support to the financial sector in Viet Nam envisions over the medium term an independent regulator, in terms \nof  both  operational  and  financial  autonomy,  with  appropriate  capacities;  financial  firms  with  strong  risk-\nmanagement systems and corporate governance; and substantive development of financial sector infrastructure. \n ", "2   \n \n4.  Weak  Fiscal  and  Monetary  Policy  Coordination  and  Public  Debt  Management. \nCoordination  between  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  is  central  to  improving  public  debt \nmanagement and strengthening the primary market for government debt. Greater predictability \nin the issuance of public debt requires increased coordination between fiscal and monetary \nauthorities,  including  more  effective  exchange  of  information  on  liquidity  forecasting, \ngovernment  cash  flows  and  borrowing  needs,  and  monetary  management.  Public  debt \nmanagement functions are currently scattered across various government entities in the Ministry \nof  Finance  (MOF)  and  State  Bank  of  Vietnam  (SBV).  Developing  an  appropriate  legal \nframework for public debt management and centralizing these functions over time into a single \nentity will help create a deeper and more liquid government debt market.  \n \n5.  Lack of Standardized Contracts has Limited Development of the Money Market. An \nactive money market is central to capital market development\u2014providing an anchor to the \neconomy\u2019s yield curve by pricing returns on the shortest maturities of debt. Development of a \nmeaningful benchmark yield curve will require regular issues of benchmark securities as well as \nstrengthening of the interbank money market, which is currently fragmented between state-\nowned  and  other  banks,  and  characterized  by  weak  infrastructure  (particularly  the  lack  of \nstandardized contracts for repurchase agreements among participants).6 \n \nB.  Investor and Consumer Protection \n \n6.  Strengthening of the Securities Regulator is Key to Promoting Investor Protection. \nA fundamental constraint to the growth in size as well as heterogeneity of the pool of investors \nin  the capital  markets is  a  weak  framework  for  investor protection. Strengthening  investor \nprotection will help attract more domestic investors to the regulated markets as well as greater \nforeign portfolio investment. This will require regulatory and institutional changes that provide for \nhigher levels of transparency and information disclosure, and establishment of a framework for \ninvestor protection consistent with international standards. Towards this end, a comprehensive \nnew Securities Law 2006 has been adopted, but its effective implementation will need a strong \nmarket  regulator  with  capabilities  for  high  quality  inspection  and  surveillance,  and  a \ncomprehensive compliance program. The State Securities Commission (SSC), the securities \nmarkets\u2019 regulator, has established a new department for undertaking market surveillance and \nmonitoring, whose capacity needs strengthening. This needs to be complemented by expanding \nand clarifying the role of self-regulatory organizations (SROs) such as stock exchanges in \nsurveillance and monitoring, and by developing operating procedures specifying the roles and \nresponsibilities of the SROs and of SSC. Strengthening SSC\u2019s capacity to carry out its mandate \neffectively will necessitate greater use of information technology (IT), including development of a \nweb-based system to facilitate lodgment, monitoring, and resolution of investor complaints. \n \n7.  Consumer  Protection  Will  Benefit  from  Improvement  in  the  Regulatory  and \nSupervisory Framework for Insurance. The insurance sector is expanding rapidly not only in \nsize but also in the range and complexity of products offered (e.g., investment-linked insurance \nplans). Sustaining this growth will require updated regulations (e.g., introduction of risk-based \ncapital adequacy requirements) and strengthened capacity in the Insurance Department of MOF \nto allow for effective oversight.   \n \n8.  Anti-Money  Laundering,  Deposit  Insurance,  and  Leasing  Subsector  Remain \nUnderdeveloped. Key foundational elements necessary for an effective anti-money laundering \nregime were targeted under FSPL II (e.g., initiation of a regulatory framework and financial \n                                                 \n6   Improved monitoring of interbank transactions in the money markets will be facilitated by a new information system \nlikely to be financed under a proposed World Bank loan. \n ", "  3\nintelligence unit). These need to be built on to strengthen the regime (e.g., through use of IT; \nprovision  of  additional  resources  and  staff;  and  development  of  guidelines  for  financial \ninstitutions on transaction reporting, know-your-customer requirements, and development of \ninternal anti-money laundering procedures). The significance of Deposit Insurance of Vietnam \n(DIV) will increase with continuing equitization of state-owned commercial banks and financial \nliberalization  in  the  banking  sector,  requiring  efforts  to  strengthen  the  legal  framework  for \ndeposit insurance. There is also a need to facilitate awareness about resolution of bankruptcy in \nleasing contracts to support growth of the nascent leasing industry.  \n \nC.  Financial Sector Infrastructure \n \n9.  Improved Accounting and Auditing Needed to Continue Enhancing Transparency. \nAccounting  and  auditing  standards  have  improved  over  time,  supported  in  part  by  ADB \nassistance. Increased transparency of financial data entails continued improvement through \nintroduction  of  new  standards  as  well  as  updating  and  strengthening  existing  standards. \nImplementation of the auditing standards by small and medium-sized auditing firms is central to \nenhanced transparency of capital markets. \n \n10.  Finding  Appropriate  Regulatory  Architecture  is  an  Emerging  Concern.  With \ncontinuing growth in the size and sophistication of the financial sector, Viet Nam needs to \ndevelop a long-term perspective on the evolution of appropriate architecture for financial sector \nregulation and supervision\u2014taking into consideration a range of potential models from a single \nunified supervisory authority to multiple but coordinating regulators. \n \n11.  The proposed assistance will encompass the broad range of these issues, and help \nstrengthen  nonbank  financial  intermediation  by  (i)  addressing  the  need  to  enhance  the \nregulatory and wider financial market infrastructure, (ii) fostering a framework for capital market \ndevelopment, and (iii) promoting investor protection. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The main impact of the TA is expected to be a greater role of capital markets in domestic \nfinancing. The outcome of the TA will be the strengthening of alternative channels of market-\nbased financial intermediation through enhanced investor and consumer protection, improved \nframework for securities issuance, and better infrastructure in the capital markets.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Debt Issuance in Government Bond Market. The TA will support measures to improve \nthe institutional framework for issuance of securities and promote the government bond market \nby assisting MOF in undertaking studies to (i) identify procedures to prevent collusion among \nbidders in auctions of government bonds, and (ii) develop a plan for establishing a system of \nprimary dealers in government securities if deemed desirable for the current stage of financial \ndevelopment. Government efforts to consolidate existing bond issues (by revising Decree 141 to \nenable buyback) will be supported by a study of market participants to identify and devise \nappropriate buyback mechanisms.  \n \n14.  Improving  Fiscal-Monetary  Policy  Coordination  and  Public  Debt  Management. \nCoordination between fiscal and monetary policy for bond market development will be promoted \nby supporting MOF and SBV in establishing a joint interdepartmental working group to improve \ninformation exchange and coordination for the bond market, as well as for enhancing two-way \nexchange of information with market participants. A seminar will be held to provide international \n ", "4   \nperspective and best practices for fiscal and monetary policy coordination for bond market \ndevelopment.  This  will  be  complemented  by  workshops  and  training  for  working  group \nparticipants and diverse credit institutions on aspects such as integrating treasury management \nwith debt management, and improving cash flow and liquidity forecasting. The Government is \nconsidering establishing a public debt management office, for which the working group is a \nprototype. The TA will support MOF in drafting a new law on public debt management for \nsubmission to the National Assembly. \n \n15.  Standardized  Repurchase  Agreements  in  Money  Markets.  To  strengthen  the \ninterbank money market, the TA will support SBV in promoting use of a standardized (master) \nagreement in interbank repurchase agreements. Targeted training will be provided to relevant \nSBV staff, commercial banks, other credit institutions, and other market participants. The TA will \nalso assist SBV, in consultation with money market participants, to finalize a master agreement \nfor use in interbank transactions between SBV and other banks. \n \n16.  Stronger  Capital  Market  Surveillance  and  Monitoring.  Investor protection will be \npromoted by enhancing the monitoring and supervisory capacity of SSC, particularly the newly \nestablished Department of Market Surveillance and Compliance. The TA will support SSC in the \ndevelopment  of  a  legal  framework  and  related  capacity  for  monitoring  and  supervision  of \nexchanges and market participants. This will include regulations and procedures for market \nsurveillance and compliance that will define the subjects and objects of surveillance, and clarify \nresponsibilities and roles for cooperation between component entities (including the Ho Chi \nMinh City Stock Exchange and HSTC). Design and implementation plans will be developed for \nthree  IT  systems  supporting  online  surveillance,  information  disclosure,  and  reporting  and \ncompliance  by  regulated  entities.  The  systems  will  (i) enable  electronic  filing  by  regulated \nparties, (ii) allow for prompt and effective public disclosure of relevant market information, and \n(iii) strengthen supervision and enforcement concerning market participants. The TA will also \nsupport training and knowledge transfer, including development of a training manual, related to \nthe regulations and procedures for monitoring and surveillance along with the new IT systems.  \n \n17.  Improved  Supervision  in  Insurance.  The  Insurance  Department  in  MOF  will  be \nassisted in developing procedures and related capacity for effective supervision of recently \nintroduced  risk-based  capital  adequacy  rules  for  insurance  companies  and  for  regulations \ncovering new products. Training will be provided to insurance department staff on (i) the use of \nquantitative and qualitative statistical methods to verify  the risk-based capital of insurance \ncompanies based on financial statements and managerial reports, (ii) production of analytical \nreports on fact findings, (iii) assessing the impact of risk-based capital regulations on industry \nrobustness and competitiveness, and (iv) reviewing the completeness and appropriateness of \nthe risk-based capital framework formed by the regulations. Active dialogue with the industry will \nbe critical to the success of implementing risk-based capital supervision. The TA will provide for \nseminars and workshops to enable exchange of information between the regulator and industry \non the expectations of the regulator in the new framework and on industry readiness, perceived \nchallenges, and constraints to implementation of the risk-based capital regulations. \n \n18.  Enhancing Accounting and Auditing. The TA will support strengthening of financial \ninfrastructure through enhanced accounting and auditing standards and practice. Support will be \nprovided  to  MOF  in  drafting  a  new  law  on  independent  audit,  and  improving  the  auditing \npractices and standards of smaller and medium-sized auditing firms. The TA will also support \nMOF in introducing new accounting standards in the Viet Nam accounting system, and updating \nand strengthening existing auditing standards.  \n \n19.  Finance  Sector  Regulatory  Architecture.  The  TA  will  assist  the  Government  in \nundertaking  a  study  of  the  regulatory  architecture  to  develop  a  more  systematic  and \n ", "  5\ninstitutionalized  approach  to  interagency  cooperation  and  coordination  among  financial \nregulators, including MOF, SBV and DIV. The study will review and recommend measures to \nincrease the effectiveness of information exchange and of coordination between the financial \nsupervision agencies in accordance with each agency\u2019s functions. \n \n20.  Anti-Money  Laundering,  Deposit  Insurance,  and  Leasing.  Capacity  will  be \nstrengthened in DIV by providing training to facilitate effective implementation of the new law on \ncredit institutions. Lack of awareness about leasing contracts will be mitigated by information \ndissemination workshops targeting elements of the judiciary (economic court judges) and law \nenforcement. Strengthening the anti-money laundering regime will be promoted by facilitating \nthe establishment of a transaction monitoring system. The TA will also support development of a \nlegal  framework  for  securitized  transactions  by  (i)  including  provisions  on  securitized \ntransactions  in  the  draft  of  the  law  on  credit  institutions,  and  (ii)  preparing  best-practice \nreference materials to assist in passing and disseminating rules on securitized transactions. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The  total  cost  of  the  proposed  TA  is  estimated  at  $1,250,000  of  which  a  total  of \n$1,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government \nwill provide facilities, counterpart staff, and other miscellaneous services valued at $250,000 \nequivalent. Cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  SBV will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the TA and the International Cooperation \nDepartment  will  serve  as  the  main  focal  point.  Implementing  agencies  will  include  MOF \n(including  SSC),  DIV,  and  SBV.  The  EA  will  establish  and  chair  an  interagency  review \ncommittee that will include representatives from relevant government agencies and ADB. The \ncommittee will meet as needed to review progress and facilitate effective implementation of the \nTA. The TA will be implemented over 14 months and is expected to commence in June 2008 \nand be completed by August 2009. \n \n23.  The TA will require an estimated 44 person-months of consulting services, consisting of \n23  person-months  of  international  and  21  person-months  of  national  consulting  services. \nConsultants will be engaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) because of the wide diversity of \nexpertise needed. A project coordinator will also be recruited. Outline terms of reference for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. All consultants will submit an inception report detailing the draft \nwork plan and schedule within 1 week of fielding; and provide concise, regular updates to the \nrelevant implementing agency, EA, and ADB outlining progress and identifying implementation \nissues. A final report will be required to be submitted according to a schedule agreed with the \nrelevant implementing agency and ADB in consultation with the EA. All services, equipment, \nand material to support TA implementation will be procured by direct purchase in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time); equipment will be \nutilized by implementing agency or returned to ADB at the end of the TA. Facilitation of advance \ndisbursements for workshops and publications will require use of the Advance Payment Facility. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Viet Nam for Support for Developing Capital Markets and Building Capacity \nin the Financial Sector, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nCapital markets play a  Increase in number of  MOF, SSC, and HSTC  \u2022  Political stability \ngreater role in domestic  listed companies from  publications, websites, and  \u2022  Sound macroeconomic \nfinancing  190 in 2007 to 225 in  data  policies \n  2011   \n  Risks \nValue of new corporate  \u2022  Regional financial \nbond issuances  shocks may impact \nincreases by 10% in  Viet Nam\u2019s capital \n2011 compared with  markets and affect \n2007  investor confidence \n\u2022  Equity market may be \ncharacterized by \nunsustainable asset \nprice bubble   \nOutcome      Risks \nAlternative channels of  Turnover ratio of  MOF, SSC, and HSTC  \u2022  Poor governance and \nmarket-based financial  government securities  publications, websites, and  corruption may weaken \nintermediation are  at HSTC increases 5%  data  effective program \nstrengthened  in 2009 compared to  implementation \n  2007  \u2022  Vested interests and \n    political opposition may \n  Bid-ask spreads for  slow program \ngovernment bonds \nimplementation \ndecline by at least \n\u2022  Political backlash \n5 basis points by 2009 \nagainst rapid reforms \nfrom 22 basis points in \nmay weaken \n2007 \ngovernment commitment \n \nto reform \nNumber of retail \n \ninvestors increases 5% \nby 2009 over 2007 \nOutputs       \n1.
