INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Two of the four pillars of the Kingdom of Bhutan\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan, 2013\u20132018 are \nsustainable and equitable socioeconomic development, and good governance.1 Achieving this \nrequires diversifying the country\u2019s economy, creating an enabling environment for private sector \ndevelopment, and reducing poverty and inequality by enhancing the standard of living and the \nquality of life of the most vulnerable sections of Bhutanese society.  Gender equality concerns \nare integrated in the plan to ensure that the poor\u2014many of whom are women\u2014benefit from \neconomic growth transforming the Bhutan economy. The National Commission for Women and \nChildren (NCWC) is the Government agency responsible for protecting, promoting and reporting \non rights of women and children in Bhutan. Its Strategic Plan, 2014\u20132019 is an accompanying \ndocument  to  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  with  the  following  strategic  priorities:  (i)  enhance \nsocioeconomic  opportunities  for  women,  (ii)  address  sociocultural  gender  stereotypes,  (iii) \npromote  gender  responsive  governance,  (iv)  provide  social  and  legal  protection,  and  (v) \nstrengthen institutional capacity of NCWC.2   \n \n2.  This capacity development technical assistance (TA)  will strengthen the institutional \ncapacity of NCWC to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment through national and \nlocal government institutions.  It will also contribute to strengthen the private sector through \npublic\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) in economic projects and in the provision of social services \nthat benefit the poor, especially poor women.3  It will build capacity of functional women self-\nhelp groups (SHGs) by enhancing their marketing capacity and promoting an entrepreneurial \nculture in the villages (and potentially extending to the whole district) where these SHGs are \noperating. More viable and productive SHG enterprises will create employment and enhance \nrural income, a priority in the plan.  \n \n3.  The TA is included in Bhutan\u2019s country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016.  The pre-\nfact finding mission discussed the TA with NCWC in March 2015 and in a fact-finding mission in \nAugust 2015, and consulted with a wide range of government, civil society, and private sector \nstakeholders.4 The government concurred with the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation \narrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.  Comments  from  the \nNCWC  are  incorporated  in  this  TA  report.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in    \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Despite an average gross domestic product growth of 8% in the past decade, rural \npoverty in Bhutan has remained high (at 16.7%) with more than half of its 20 districts having \npoverty rates above the national poverty rate of 12% (2012).5  Youth unemployment is high at \n9.5% for males and 11.6% among females.6 Gender disparities still exist in employment, income \ngeneration, and education enrollment and completion rate (footnote 2).  Labor force participation \nof females (59%) is lower than that of males (72%).7 Income-earning opportunity is also lower \n                                                \n1  Government of Bhutan, Gross National Happiness Commission. 2013. 11th Five-Year Plan, 2013\u20132018.

The report on Gender and Employment Challenges in Bhutan in 2013 identified the \nreasons for women\u2019s unemployment, including (i) lack of available jobs, (ii) lack of experience \nand skill, (iii) poor academic performance in secondary school, and (iv) family and marriage \nproblems.8 A year earlier, the 2012 Bhutan Living Standards Survey similarly asked the reasons \nfor women\u2019s unemployment and found that 93% of urban women aged 25 to 34 and 99% of \nwomen aged 35 to 44 cited \u201chouse or family duties,\u201d which could cover childcare (footnote 6). \nAs noted in ADB\u2019s 2014 Bhutan Gender Equality Diagnostic of Selected Sectors, the data \nsuggest a pressure on working women, especially in urban areas where family networks and \nassistance are less available.9 \n \n6.    In  the  rural  areas,  the  2012  agriculture  sector  study  by  the  Food  and  Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations and World Bank highlighted the burden carried by rural \nwomen as a result of reduced male involvement in farming due to rural\u2013urban migration.10 The \nstudy also sought for greater attention to be given to the labor burden on women. Another study \nfound that rural women were increasingly responsible for bringing farm produce to market.11 \nAccording to stakeholders consulted for this proposed TA, it is important to note the increasing \nnumber of rural women coming to Thimphu12 market and other urban markets to sell their \nproduce. These female vendors sleep at the market, have no decent toilet and other place to \nwash, and expose themselves to the risk of gender-based and sexual violence as well as theft. \n \n7.    The  government  recognizes  the  critical  role  of  decentralized  structures\u2014dzongkhag \n(district), gewog (block), and chiwog (village)\u2014in achieving sustainable, gender- and socially \ninclusive economic growth. Since 2004, the NCWC has gradually established itself at the central \nlevel, through a focused approach aimed at strengthening gender mainstreaming capacities of \nsector agencies.13 The challenge \u2013at the moment- lies in NCWC\u2019s ability to deliver on two of the \ncritical aspects of its mandate: decentralized coordination and public-private partnerships for \ngreater gender equality results. In this context, increased capacity in mainstreaming gender \nequality in development planning of decentralized structures\u2019 and delivery of services would \ncontribute to gender equity in economic growth. Improved coordination between decentralized \nstructures  and  central  government  agencies  would  enhance  government\u2019s  effectiveness  in \ndelivering much-needed economic and social services to their constituents, especially the poor \nwho need those most. The Economic Development Policy (2010) of Bhutan identified PPP as a \nkey approach in working towards sustainable, inclusive economic growth.14 The PPP approach \nwill  contribute  to  expanding  Bhutan\u2019s  economic  base,  developing  the  private  sector,  and \ncreating jobs and business opportunities. Integrating a gender equality perspective in PPP could \nhelp ensure that men and women benefit equitably from the gains of economic growth. \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2015.

The TA builds on the successful implementation, results and lessons from the grant \nproject Advancing Economic Opportunities of Women and Girls, funded by the Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction.15 This grant enabled NCWC to successfully fulfill its mandate to promote \ngender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. The capacity of gender focal persons in each of \nthe central government agencies on gender mainstreaming was improved and a web-based \ngender monitoring system established. The same grant also enabled close to a thousand poor \nrural women increase their income through micro-enterprises set up by self-help groups (SHGs) \nwhere they were members. These SHGs and new ones whose growth was spawned by the \nexample demonstrated by successful SHGs are ready to expand their volume of production, \nproduce new or improved products, and expand markets. \n \n9.  The need for gender mainstreaming in local governments and building their capacity to \ndeliver economic and social services to the poor is another gap that needs to be addressed.  \nGovernment agencies consulted for the design of this TA highlighted the need for PPPs and \nworking at all government levels to reduce poverty, especially among poor women, and achieve \nthe goal of \u201csustainable and equitable socioeconomic development,\u201d one of four pillars of gross \nnational happiness (footnote 1). This TA aims to build capacity of government, private sector, \nand civil society organizations to enter into such multistakeholder partnerships to achieve the \ngoals of poverty reduction and sustainable, equitable socioeconomic development. Specifically, \nthrough these PPPs, this TA is expected to respond to cited barriers to women\u2019s effective \nengagement in economic activities (i.e., need for childcare support, lack of lodging facilities for \nrural women market vendors, and need for more economic opportunities through providing \nassistance to SHGs). \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be access to productive resources and social services by the poor\u2014\nparticularly women\u2014 improved in selected urban and rural areas, aligned with Bhutan\u2019s 11th \nFive-Year Plan, 2013\u201318. The outcome will be strengthened government capacity in addressing \ngender  equality  concerns  and  delivering  services  in  partnership  with  private  sector  and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will support this outcome through the following outputs:16 \n(i)  Output 1: Capacity of the National Commission for Women and Children for \ngreater achievement of gender equality results at local level strengthened. \nThe gender focal persons serve as NCWC\u2019s extensions in promoting gender \nmainstreaming at central and local government levels. Elected and appointed \nofficials play key roles in ensuring that gender equality concerns are integrated in \ngovernment  planning  and  budgeting,  and  in  delivery  of  services.  For  these \nreasons, 35 gender focal persons (15 at central and 20 at district levels), 100 \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2011. Proposed Grant Assistance to Bhutan for Advancing Economic Opportunities of Women and Girls. \nManila. \n16 The TA presents some risks at outcome  and output  levels, including: (i) NCWC\u2019s challenge to fully institutionalize \ngender-inclusive partnerships across sector and line agencies and participating districts; (ii) limited support from \nsector and local government officials to NCWC\u2019s commitment to gender mainstreaming; and (iii) longer than \nexpected time to reach consensus on PPP modalities. Risks are reflected in the design and monitoring framework \n(Appendix 1). \n ", "4   \ndistrict officials and staff, and 60% of parliamentarians will be trained in gender \nmainstreaming. More in-depth gender analysis of key aspects of the Bhutanese \nsociety (namely, law, economy, and governance) will be conducted to contribute \nto the body of knowledge for policy reform and development planning. Gender \nadvocacy tools with a broader reach (such as videos) will be produced and \ncirculated. \n(ii)  Output 2: Public\u2013private partnerships addressing the needs of women and \nvulnerable  groups  established.  PPP agreements will be formulated, in the \nfollowing areas: \n(a)  socioeconomic  security  and  physical  safety  of  market  vendors  and \ninformal sector workers that will lead to the establishment of two  market \nvendors\u2019 cooperatives in Thimphu, and 30-bed lodging facility for market \nvendors; and \n(b)  access to childcare services by formal and informal sector workers in \nThimphu that will lead to the establishment of the following facilities: five \ncr\u00e8ches (day care centers) in central government agencies, one cr\u00e8che in \nprivate sector, and two cr\u00e8ches for informal sector workers.17 \n(iii)  Output  3:  Capacity  building  of  selected  self-help  groups  on  upgraded \nproduction  technologies  and  market  accessibility  undertaken.  Capacity \ndevelopment program on upgrading of production technologies and increased \naccess to profitable markets for SHGs will be implemented. This is expected to \nlead to (a) increased number of new products or designs sold by SHGs in cane \nand bamboo craft and textile weaving; (b) technology upgrading and expanded \nmarket  base  for  selected  products  such  as  raw  and  processed  fruits  and \nvegetables, honey, cardamom, animal feeds (grain), milk, and poultry; (c) 20 \nagreements reached for marketing of SHG products at district level one-stop \nfarmers\u2019 shops; and (d) formation of five SHGs in recycled waste livelihoods. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.65 million, of which $1.50 million will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  and  administered  by  ADB.  The \ngovernment  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the form  of  remuneration  and  per  diem of \ncounterpart  staff,  office  and  office  supplies,  secretarial  assistance,  domestic transportation, \nmeeting venues, staff time to review outputs of consultants and conduct periodic field visits, and \nother in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The NCWC will be the executing agency for the TA. A small project management unit \nwill  be  established  within  the  NCWC\u2019s  Women  Division  to  carry  out  day-to-day  TA \nimplementation. The Women Division\u2014in coordination with the project management unit\u2014will \nwork  with  the  TA  consultants  to  support  two-way  knowledge  transfer.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented over 36 months, commencing in mid-January 2016 with completion date expected \nin December 2018. All consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).18 Consulting inputs will be provided \nunder the TA as follows: \n                                                \n17 In carrying out the needs assessment for the cr\u00e8che in the central government agencies, private companies, \ninformal sector, and the lodging facility for informal sector workers, NCWC will consult and seek endorsement of \nrelevant government agencies. \n18 For the recruitment of individual consultants and organizations (firms and/or NGOs), the use of output-based (lump-\nsum) contracts will be considered for all consulting services.  \n ", "  5 \n(i)  Individual national experts: project manager (36 person-months); monitoring and \nevaluation officer (36 person-months); finance and procurement officer at the \nproject  management  unit  (36  person-months);  administrative  and  financial \nconsultant  (9  person-months);  researcher  for  cr\u00e8che  and  lodging  needs  (2 \nperson-months); researcher for gender and law (3 person-months); PPP expert \n(6 person-months); researcher and gender economist (6 person-months); and \ngender and governance expert (6 person-months). \n(ii)  National organizations (2): one NGO responsible for activities related to market \nvendors and informal sector (36 months), to be engaged under the consultants\u2019 \nqualifications selection; and a firm responsible for video production (4 months) to \nbe engaged following the use of Service Delivery Assignments, based on para. \n2.43 of ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from \ntime to time). \n(iii)  An international NGO to be engaged under the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod (80:20 quality to cost ratio).
