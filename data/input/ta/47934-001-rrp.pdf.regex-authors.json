I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsenior loan of up to $40,000,000 to Khan Bank for Supporting Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized \nEnterprises (MSMEs) in Mongolia.1 \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n  \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n2.  In most developing countries, MSMEs are important engines of economic growth and \nkey contributors to poverty reduction by increasing individual incomes and creating employment. \nIn  Mongolia,  MSMEs  comprise  98%  of  all  enterprises,  three-quarters  of  which  are \nmicroenterprises. Access to finance is the foremost constraint for Mongolian MSMEs\u201430% of \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Mongolia perceive access to finance as the \nlargest issue for their operations.2 It is estimated that only 10% of about 37,000 Mongolian \nSMEs regularly access finance through banks.3 A World Bank study notes that when finance is \navailable to SMEs, loan terms and conditions are characterized by high interest rates, shorter \nmaturities, and smaller amounts that do not meet the full financial needs of these companies \nand primarily require immovable collateral (footnote 2). Overall, bank lending has continued to \nincrease since the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009. However, a marked gap remains in \nterms of funding needs for the numerous MSMEs, as many banks continue to focus on top-tier, \nlarger companies, which are perceived to be of less risk.4  \n \n3.  Given the access to finance issues in Mongolia for MSMEs, the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) met with several banks in 2013 to identify suitable candidates with the interest and \nability to serve the SME segment, and to reach the microenterprise segment. Additionally, ADB \nsought banks that could effectively address the needs of MSMEs, with outreach to rural areas \noutside Ulaanbaatar. Rural areas tend to have higher incidences of poverty in Mongolia.5 The \nbank has a sound credit profile, strategic focus on MSMEs, and the largest branch network in \nrural  areas.  Khan  Bank  has  a  developed  and  growing  MSME  platform,  and  has  received \ntechnical advisory services from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for \nthe creation of institutional structures, and training and education programs designed for local \nstaff. The proposed assistance builds on an ADB nonsovereign loan amounting to $10 million \nprovided to Khan Bank in 2007, which was general in nature.6 As the bank has matured and \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   World Bank. 2012. Financial Sector Assessment: Mongolia. Washington, DC.  \n3  The World Bank Enterprise Surveys. http://www.enterprisesurveys.org/. Other constraints noted were the tax rate, \ninadequately  educated  workforce,  informal  sector  practices,  political  instability, and  licensing  and  permitting \nproblems.

Fitch Ratings has rated Khan Bank\u2019s long-term issuer default ratings B (stable).7 \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n4.  Overview. Khan Bank, established in 1991, is Mongolia\u2019s largest bank in terms of total \nassets,  loans,  and  deposits\u2014with  market  shares  of  23%  (assets),  23%  (loans),  and  26% \n(deposits) in 2013. The bank, previously known as the Agriculture Bank of Mongolia, was owned \nby agricultural cooperatives, herdsmen, and farmers. It was privatized in 2003 and renamed \nKhan  Bank  in  a  post-Soviet  effort  to  privatize  the  banking  sector.  Although  privatized,  it \ncontinues to maintain a focus on reaching the underserved in rural areas with inclusive finance \nas a priority in strategy and planning. Khan Bank has 335 ATMs, accounting for 34% of all \nATMs in Mongolia, and a branch network of 528 (100 in Ulaanbaatar and 428 in rural areas), \nproviding banking services to at least 62% of households in Mongolia (1.8 million customers out \nof a population of 2.9 million).8 The bank is also the largest single employer in the financial \nsector with 5,000 employees. Female staff represented 63% of total employees in 2013.  \n \nKhan  Bank\u2019s  principal  activities  are  corporate  and  MSME  lending,  as  well  as  retail  and \ninstitutional  lending.9 Product  lines  include  a  range  of  loan  and  deposit  products,  foreign \nexchange, trade finance, cash management, and international payment services.  \n \n5.  Khan Bank\u2019s current MSME portfolio is well diversified in terms of sectors, comprising \nmainly trade and commerce, construction, agriculture, and transportation loans. Khan Bank \nbegan  officially  segregating  its  lending  to  MSMEs  in  2000.  A  separate  SME  center  was \nestablished in 2010, which enabled a more focused approach to MSME lending.10 Through its \nexpanded branch network, Khan Bank plans to offer new products, such as working capital, \ntrade  finance,  and  capital  expenditure  financing  through  electronic  and  mobile  banking  to \npromote cost efficiencies. As part of its strategy, Khan Bank intends to implement a structured \ncustomer acquisition process, maximize cross-sale opportunities, and position Khan Bank as a \ntotal solutions provider to the MSME segment.  \n \n6.  Khan Bank tailors its relationship management approach and product offering to each \nsubsegment. In addition, Khan Bank has established a business incubator center in 2006, which \nprovides practical assistance to improve business management skills, connects MSMEs to \ndesired partners, provides updated information to enable them to make business decisions, and \nhelps to maintain long and stable relations with these businesses.  \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n7.  Ownership. The largest shareholder of Khan Bank is Sawada Holdings (Japan), which \nowns  41.3%  of  the  bank\u2019s  capital.  Sawada  Holdings  is  engaged  in  securities,  banking, \ncommodities, real estate, and venture capital. Sawada Holdings is listed on the Osaka Stock \n                                                \n7  Reuters. 2013.

The current average \nloan size is MNT36 million. \n10 Seven SME centers\u2014five in Ulaanbaatar and two in the largest rural areas (Darkhan and Erdenet)\u2014specialize in \nproviding banking services to MSMEs, with higher authorization levels and more specialized staff.

The Tavan Bogd Group is one of the largest private conglomerates in Mongolia, \nwith 12 affiliated companies engaged in retail and wholesale, travel and tourism, manufacturing, \nand food production. HS International (Asia) Limited (HSIA) owns 13.1% of Khan Bank. HSIA is \na  100%  subsidiary  company  of  Sawada  Holdings  in  Hong  Kong,  China.  HSIA  conducts \nbusiness activities within the People\u2019s Republic of China, including market research on various \nregions in Asia. D. Hulan11 has a shareholding in Khan Bank of 13.3% and the International \nFinance Corporation (IFC) owns the remaining 9.3%. \n \n8.  Management. The senior management team is composed of a team of experienced \nbanking executives with prior work at multiple banks throughout Asia. The four key senior \npositions are (i) chief executive officer (CEO); (ii) deputy CEO; (iii) chief financial officer; and \n(iv) chief risk officer. Additional information on the bank\u2019s management and an organizational \ndiagram is provided in Ownership, Management, and Governance.12  \n \n9.  Governance structure. The board of directors comprises seven members who bring \nextensive international banking and other professional experience to Khan Bank. The board has \ntwo independent non-executive directors and five non-executive directors. The board is chaired \nby  H.  Sawada,  who  is  the  President  and  CEO  of  Sawada  Holdings,  the  bank\u2019s  largest \nshareholder; he is also a founder and chairman of HSIA.  \n \n10.  The board approves Khan Bank\u2019s strategic plan and key policies and monitors their \nimplementation through the board committees and key management personnel appointed by \nthe board. The three board committees\u2014audit committee, risk management committee, and \ngovernance and remuneration committee\u2014are chaired by board directors.  \n \nD.  Financial Performance \n \n11.  Khan  Bank  has  had  healthy  growth  from  2010  to  2013.  Total  assets  grew  from \n$1,125 million in 2010 to $2,904 million in 2013, representing a compound annual growth rate of \n37.18%. Gross customer loans grew from $568 million in 2010 to $1,502 million in 2013. Total \ncustomer deposits grew at a robust pace of 22.7% (3-year compound annual growth rate) from \n$955 million in 2010 to $1,763 million in 2013. Financial highlights of Khan Bank are provided in \nthe financial analysis.13 \n \n12.  Earnings. In 2013, net income was MNT96.7 billion, which represented a growth rate of \n35% from MNT71.4 billion in 2012. The increase can be attributed to the increase in net interest \nincome (29.4% in 2013 and 19.2% in 2012) as a result of the growth in the loan portfolio \nresulting from effective marketing and sales efforts and Khan Bank\u2019s reputation. Despite the \nfalling interest rate environment, the net interest margin was still healthy (6.8% in 2013 and \n8.0% in 2012) across all business segments. Operating efficiency improved despite branch \nexpansion,  training,  and  adaptation  to  new  information  software  (cost-to-income  ratio  was \n46.3% in 2013 and 52.7% in 2012). In 2013, return on average assets (ROAA) was 2.5% and \nreturn on average equity (ROAE) was 34.0%. This was above the banking sector average \n(2.17% ROAA and 28% ROAE) and is the highest among its peers.  Khan Bank has managed to \n                                                \n11 D.

Capitalization. Khan Bank had a tier 1 capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 11.1% and a \ntotal  CAR  of  16.6%  in  2013  (2012:  tier  1  CAR,  10.8%,  total  CAR,  16.6%).  The  bank\u2019s \ncapitalization was above that of its peers, which had an average CAR of 15.5% in 2013 resulting \nfrom an increase in subordinated debt obtained from IFC. The total CAR year-end results were \nsimilar to 2012 and the bank met the new regulatory requirements of tier 1 CAR of 9.0% and \ntotal CAR of 14.0%, which came into effect on 30 June 2013. Total growth in capital was \nsupported  by  retained  earnings  and  new  subordinated  debt  provided  by  FMO  and  DEG \namounting to $32 million in 2012 and most recently $40 million from IFC, which were fully \ndisbursed in March 2014.  \n \n14.  Funding and liquidity structure. In 2013, Khan Bank\u2019s funding structure comprised the \nfollowing:  customer  deposits  (64.7%),  short-term  borrowings  (16.3%), long-term  borrowings \n(11.4%), equity and retained earnings (7.0%), and others (0.6%). Customer deposits grew by \n34% in 2013 (14.4% in 2012), which was slightly above the sector average growth rate of 32% \nin 2013.14 It also receives specialized funding, as do the other large banks, from the government \nto provide subsidized funding to SMEs active in specific industries (e.g., meat and flour), as well \nas for home loans. This funding comprised 19% of total liabilities as of December 2013. Khan \nBank has existing credit lines with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, \nFMO, and IFC, and trade finance facilities with ADB; and will continue to maintain and develop \nrelationships with local and international commercial banks. In 2013, Khan Bank\u2019s cash reserve \nratio was 15.8% (14.7% in 2012) and its liquidity ratio (liquid assets as a percentage of total \nassets) was 46% (34.6% in 2012). Both were compliant with the Bank of Mongolia (BOM) \nminimum requirement of 12% (cash reserve ratio)15 and 25% (liquidity ratio).  \n \n15.  Loan portfolio. Khan Bank\u2019s total loan portfolio of MNT2,484.8 billion as of December \n2013 is segmented as follows: corporate banking (20%), MSME (26%), and retail (54%). In \n2013,  gross  loans  were  concentrated  in  (i)  consumption  loans\u2014including  salary,  pension, \nleasing, mortgage, and employee loans (49%); (ii) trade and finance (16%); (iii) construction \n(10%);  (iv)  agriculture  (3%);  (v)  industrial  (8%);  (vi)  mining  (4%);  and  (vii)  others  (10%). \nGeographically, the portfolio is in Ulaanbaatar (55%) and rural areas (45%). As more branches \nopen in rural areas, demand for banking services is expected to increase. 16   \n \n16.  Exposure to the top 20 group obligors is moderate, at 17.3% (18.2% in 2012) of gross \nloans in 2013. The largest single borrower accounted for 12% of the total exposure to top \n20 borrowers; and is a large Mongolian conglomerate whose operations are mainly in retail, \nwholesale trade, manufacturing, and construction. Exposure to the largest individual and/or \ngroup accounted for 12.5% of the bank\u2019s total capital, which is below the 20% regulatory limit. \nLoans to related parties amounted to MNT17.9 billion and accounted for 3.8% of total capital in \n2013 (6.4% in 2012). Related party loans are to Tavan Bogd and its affiliates as well as key \nmanagement personnel.  \n \n                                                \n14 ADB\u2019s Mongolia Resident Mission; Bank of Mongolia.

Nonperforming loans (NPLs) were \nreported at 1.5% of gross loans in 2013 (0.9% in 2012), which is below the sector average of \n5.3% (4.2% in 2012).17 NPLs of MSMEs amounted to 1% in 2013 (0.9% in 2012). Khan Bank \nplans to maintain its total gross NPL ratio below 5% at all times. Khan Bank uses the BOM \nstandard loan classification specification.18 Since 2012, Khan Bank\u2019s loan loss coverage ratio \nhas been above 100%.19  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n18.  ADB proposes to provide a senior unsecured $40 million loan for a tenor of 5 years to \nKhan Bank for the exclusive purpose of funding MSMEs in Mongolia. The borrower shall use the \nproceeds to extend new loans to eligible MSME sub-borrowers.20  \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  Khan  Bank  will  provide  ADB  with  development  effectiveness,  safeguards,  financial \nreports,  and  MSME  loan  portfolio  information  at  predetermined  regular  intervals  and  as \nrequested.  ADB  will  review  these  reports  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  monitor  the  facility \naccordingly.  Monitoring  reports  will  be  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB\u2019s  Office  of  Risk \nManagement on a regular basis, but at least annually.21 The first such report will be submitted \nno later than 12 months after Board approval.  \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s value addition is expected to be the following: \n(i)  The  financial  sector  in  Mongolia  is  underdeveloped.  The  country\u2019s  capital \nmarkets are nascent and commercial bank funding is not readily available in \nlarge amounts. Moreover, loans with longer tenors are particularly in short supply. \nAs a result, domestic credit provided by the banking sector was 36.8% and, as \nsuch, the country lags behind its peers.22 Mongolia has also been impacted by \nthe  banking  sector  crisis  in  Europe,  as  European  commercial  banks  and \ninvestors have curtailed their lending. This has resulted in a shortage of funding. \nHence,  international  financial  institutions  are  needed  to  fill  this  funding  gap. \nADB\u2019s longer tenor loan will address a funding gap estimated to total $223 million \nby 2016, and help the bank to reduce asset\u2013liability mismatches as it will, in turn, \nprovide longer-tenor funding to MSMEs. \n(ii)  Access to credit remains one of the most critical obstacles to the development of \nthe MSME sector. ADB assistance will help to address this gap and support a \nbank  that  is  active  in  MSME  lending  through  (i)  the  provision  of  long-term \nfinancing, which will result in more private businesses serving the local economy, \n                                                \n17 Average NPLs were 4.6% in 2009\u20132013. \n18 Joint Resolution of the Governor of the Bank of Mongolia and the Minister of Finance. 2010.

Risks \n \n21.  Challenging operational environment. Mongolia\u2019s economy is largely reliant on the \nagricultural and mining sectors. It is also exposed to the slowing growth in the People\u2019s Republic \nof China. Recent high inflation and the depreciating currency have further exposed the banking \nsector to economic and policy risks. Solid economic growth prospects, together with progress in \neconomic stabilization and an open, market-led economy, partly mitigate these weaknesses. \nThe banking industry is viewed as having an underdeveloped regulatory framework\u2014lacking \nstrict enforcement of regulatory requirements. Transparency and disclosure are considered \nweak  by  international  standards.  However,  authorities  have  taken  measures  to  tighten \nprudential regulations on capital requirements, asset classification, and loss provisions. To help \nmitigate the risks imposed by the operating environment, Khan Bank carefully manages its \ncapital  position,  keeps  a  significant  liquidity  buffer,  and  maintains  a  diversified  and  highly \ngranular loan portfolio with prudent sector and borrower concentration limits.  \n \n22.  Asset quality. As Khan Bank\u2019s portfolio expands and the economy continues to grow \nmore slowly, asset quality may deteriorate. However, Khan Bank has a comprehensive risk \nmanagement system that defines, assesses, and monitors risks. \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n23.  Impacts. ADB assistance will lead to (i) increased contribution of MSMEs to gross \ndomestic product; and (ii) increased access to credit by MSMEs in Mongolia. Growth of MSMEs \nin non-mineral-based resource sectors will help diversify and strengthen the resilience of the \neconomy.  \n \n24.  Outcome. The outcome will be the growth and sustainability of Khan Bank\u2019s financial \nservices to MSMEs. Khan Bank\u2019s MSME loan portfolio is expected to grow beyond the level of \nADB\u2019s funding. Providing financing to MSMEs through loans for working capital and investment \nwill contribute to job creation, capital formation, and asset creation, including through loans for \nagriculture.  \n \n25.  Outputs. The outputs will be the (i) increased availability of MSME financing from Khan \nBank; and (ii) increased tenor of MSME loans.  \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n \n26.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and country strategy. Under Strategy 2020, ADB will \npromote inclusive growth at the regional and national levels by helping to develop financial ", "  7 \ninfrastructure,  institutions,  and  products  and  services.23 Through  such  initiatives,  ADB  will \ncontinue to assist in channeling the region\u2019s savings into the most productive investments, as \nwell as build the capacity of financial institutions by introducing international best practices. ADB \nassistance supports institutional and financial sector development through the deepening of the \nfinancial sector by increasing the ability of Khan Bank to expand lending to MSMEs and by \nstrengthening the bank\u2019s capital base.  \n \n27.  The country partnership strategy for Mongolia highlights private sector development as a \ndriver of change, and states that ADB will help strengthen financial markets to support long-term \ninvestment, innovation, and access to finance.24 The strategy also notes that access of SMEs \nand the rural population to formal sources of credit is limited. ADB\u2019s financial sector assessment \nfor Mongolia concludes that broader and deeper financial intermediation is necessary to achieve \nsustainable, long-term growth.25 The finance sector assessment recommends the continued \ndevelopment of the finance sector and improvements in access to finance. The proposed loan is \nalso  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  SME  development  program  targeting  SME  capacity \ndevelopment and job creation. \n \n28.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. An independent \nevaluation of ADB\u2019s assistance to the financial sector was conducted in 2008.26 Based on the \nanalysis  conducted  and  future  challenges  and  opportunities  in  the  financial  sector, \nrecommendations were put forward for future operations. These included (i) considering equity \ninvestments and loans to strengthen the operational capacity of Mongolian banks; (ii) using \nbanks to channel credit to address the gap in the supply of rural finance; (iii) providing longer-\nterm loans to meet the needs of MSMEs; and (iv) supporting the development of nonbank and \ncapital market sectors. The proposed assistance to Khan Bank is therefore consistent with the \nrecommendations put forward in this evaluation. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n   \n29.  The investment is classified category FI for impacts on the environment, involuntary \nresettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  investment\u2019s  potential  environment  and  social \nimpacts, its risks associated with Khan Bank\u2019s existing and/or likely future portfolio, and its \ncommitment and capacity for environmental and social management, have been assessed. \nKhan Bank will apply ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list, ensure that investments using \nADB funds abide by applicable national laws and regulations, comply with ADB Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009), and establish and maintain an appropriate environmental and social \nmanagement system satisfactory to ADB before disbursement for the financing of investments. \nADB funds will exclude financing of subprojects classified category A for environment, and \ncategory A and B for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples safeguards.27 \n \n                                                \n23 ADB. 2008.

Khan Bank was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practices \nrelating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will \nensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, \nmoney  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  remedies  for  ADB  in  the  event  of \nnoncompliance.  \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n32.  The proposed loans are within the medium-term country, industry, group, and single \ninvestment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.
