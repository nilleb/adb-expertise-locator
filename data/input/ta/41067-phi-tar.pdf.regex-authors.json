In line with its poverty reduction program, the Government of the Philippines aims to \nachieve 100% electrification of villages by 2008. However, the technical and financial capacity \nof electric cooperatives is still inadequate to ensure quality supply to consumers and expand the \nservice, particularly in the context of deregulated power markets and the wholesale electricity \nspot market (WESM).  \n \n2.  The  Government  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA) to prepare the rural electric cooperatives development \nproject. The Fact-Finding Mission was fielded from 8 to 10 May 2007 and held discussions with \nofficials of the National Electrification Administration (NEA), Department of Energy, and National \nEconomic Development Authority. The Mission reached an understanding with the Government \non the impact, outcome, outputs, cost estimates, implementation arrangements, and terms of \nreference for the TA.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Rural  Electrification  Status. At the end of 2006, about 95% of barangays2 in the \nPhilippines had access to electricity. As of December 2006, the country had 36,030 barangays, \nof  which  34,090  received  electricity  through  grid  connection  or  off-grid  systems;  1,940 \nbarangays (494 in Luzon, 361 in Visayas, and 1,085 in Mindanao) did not have access to \nelectricity. These barangays are mostly located in isolated and remote areas, and have limited \nhousehold incomes. These areas are often not considered to be financially viable for electric \ncooperatives whose technical and financial performance is weak (para. 6).  \n \n4.  Even in barangays that already have access to electricity, many households have not \nbeen able to avail of electricity either due to technical limitations of the electric cooperatives or \naffordability. The household electrification rate is only 75%, leaving more than 4.39 million \nhouseholds without access to electricity; of these, 4.03 million live in rural areas served by \nelectric cooperatives.  \n \n5.  Technical and Financial Constraints of Electric Cooperatives. Recognizing that rural \nelectrification in many areas of the country was not a viable private sector investment, in 1969 \nthe Government passed legislation creating NEA to pursue total electrification. It mandated NEA, \na  Government  agency,  to  organize  and  supervise  electric  cooperatives  for  this  purpose. \nThrough a combination of loans and subsidies to the 119 electric cooperatives as nonstock, \nnonprofit, service-oriented entities, NEA financed the setting up of the lines and substations \nneeded to bring power to mostly residential consumers in the Philippine countryside. Each \nelectric cooperative has an average of 200 staff and serves an average of 60,000 customers\u2014\nmostly  residential  (about  90%)  and  concentrated  in  rural  areas.  The  average  monthly \nconsumption  per  customer  is  between  60  and  120  kilowatt-hours.  Nationally,  electric \ncooperatives  account  for  58%  of  all  consumers;  Manila  Electric  Company  (Meralco),  the \nprivately owned distribution utility in Metro Manila, accounts for 33% and other distribution \nutilities for 9%. In terms of electricity consumption, electric cooperatives account for 24%, while \nMeralco accounts for 62% and other distribution utilities for 14%. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 28 May 2007.  \n2  A unit of administration consisting of 50 to 100 families under an administrator (captain). \n ", "2   \n6.  The  electric  cooperatives  can  be  classified  into  four  categories:  (i)  creditworthy, \nfinancially self-sufficient (about 25% of the 119 electric cooperatives); (ii) partially creditworthy, \nlarge size and density with potential efficiency gains (about 10%); (iii) marginal viability, unable \nto attract private financing at present (about 35%); and (iv) nonviable, operating in low density \nand disadvantaged areas (about 30%). Based on NEA data, the number of electric cooperatives \nwith operating losses increased from 35 in 2004 to 41 in 2006 (a 17% increase), while those \nthat were unable to cover both operating costs and debt service increased from 62 to 77 (a 24% \nincrease). As of December 2006, 73 electric cooperatives had system losses in excess of 14%, \nwhile 18 electric cooperatives had system losses higher than 20%. The Anti-Pilferage Act of \n1994 does not allow electric cooperatives to recover system losses in excess of 14% from its \nconsumers.  High  system  losses  have  contributed  to  the  financial  difficulties  of  electric \ncooperatives and make up one of the reasons for the high electricity tariff. Since the electricity is \nmainly used for lighting in rural areas, there is a potential for using efficient lighting (e.g. \ncompact fluorescent light) to reduce the demand and cost. \n \n7.  To improve the financial situation of electric cooperatives, the Electric Power Industry \nReform Act mandates the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation to \nassume  all  outstanding  financial  obligations  of  electric  cooperatives  to  NEA  and  other \ngovernment agencies incurred as of June 2001 to finance the rural electrification program. \nPower Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation has absorbed P18 billion of \nelectric  cooperative  loans.  NEA  has  since  shown  financial  turnaround  arising  from  higher \nrevenues and reduced operational expenditures. With the support of Australian Agency for \nInternational Development, the Government is undertaking a reform agenda to sustain the \ncorporate recovery of NEA. \n \n8.  Investment  Requirements  of  Electric  Cooperatives.  Consistent  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s rural electrification program, a total of 6,690 circuit kilometers of distribution lines; \n215 new substation units with a total capacity of 1,907 megavolt-amperes; and 83 substation \nunits with a total capacity of 609 megavolt-amperes in the electric cooperative franchise areas in \nLuzon, Visayas, and Mindanao need to be upgraded, rehabilitated, or revamped in the next 3 \nyears.  Necessary  information  technology  software  and  hardware,  as  well  as  kilowatt-hour \nmeters, are essential as they serve as critical components in system loss reduction and load \nresearch  analysis  in  the  distribution  system.  Moreover,  under  the  Electric  Power  Industry \nReform  Act,  the  metering  equipment  of  the  cooperatives  needs  to  be  replaced;  the  new \nequipment must be capable of using time-of-use tariffs. These meters will be strategically \nplaced in substation and feeder lines, as well as to all classes of the electric cooperatives\u2019 \nconsumer base to potentially harness the benefits of least cost power arising from time-of-use \ntariffs. About 1.6 million one-phase kilowatt-hour meters and 6,000 three-phase meters are \nneeded. These investments require more than P40 billion. \n \n9.  The electric cooperatives, as direct clients of the National Transmission Corporation \n(TransCo), qualify as priority entities in the acquisition of subtransmission lines, which are \ncurrently owned by TransCo. Although the strategy for the electric cooperatives to acquire or \nconstruct subtransmission lines within their coverage areas to gain leverage in the environment \nof open access and retail competition is sound, the cooperatives must first conduct a full \nfeasibility study to include benefit-cost analyses pertinent to decision-making prior to acquiring \nsubtransmission assets.  \n \n10.  Furthermore, under the deregulated environment of the Electric Power Industry Reform \nAct, NEA is to assist the electric cooperatives in their direct participation in the WESM. NEA is \ncurrently developing options to pool/combine contiguous electric cooperatives with a view to \n ", "  3\nstrengthen them as conglomerates to achieve common economic benefits. This will create a \nconsolidated  demand  that  will  strengthen  confidence  among  the  electric  cooperatives  with \nlimited or little experience in power pooling and also in dealing with the WESM. Moreover, \ntrading participants in the WESM are faced with risks associated with energy trading. They have \nto  contend  with  pricing  volatility,  management  of  trading  volumes,  valuation  of  risks,  and \norganization and control. Therefore NEA and the electric cooperatives must be trained on risk \nmanagement and mitigation, spot market trading simulations, load forecasting, power supply \ncontract, and pooling/conglomeration strategies. \n \n11.  Rationale  for  Providing  ADB  Support.  To  support  the  operations  of  electric \ncooperatives  and  system  expansion,  NEA  makes  various  credit  facilities  available  to  the \ncooperatives. Currently, in general, the loans have an interest charge of 10% and may have \nmaturities of up to 5 years. NEA has set aside around P1.3 billion of internally generated funds \nfor these various facilities. Further, the World Bank established an electric cooperative partial \ncredit guarantee program for system loss reduction and other energy efficiency investments of \nthe  cooperatives.  Such  loan  guarantees  are  targeted  at  electric  cooperatives  for  which \ncommercial lenders are willing to take part of the credit risk. In addition, the partial credit \nguarantee program offers grant assistance for the cost of preparing the feasibility study and \nassistance  in  seeking  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  approval  for  the  capital  expenditure \napplication.  \n \n12.  However,  these  facilities  are  inadequate  to  meet  the  cooperatives\u2019  investment \nrequirements particularly those nonviable electric cooperatives. As the existing facilities are \nmainly aimed at viable electric cooperatives, further financing facilities need to be put in place to \nfinance critical investments, particularly those of poorer cooperatives. The TA will critically \nreview and validate the electric cooperatives\u2019 investment requirements and prepare an ADB \nproject through NEA to assist nonviable electric cooperatives in improving their technical and \nfinancial capacity to make electricity accessible to new consumers.  \n  \n13.  The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s country and strategy program3 and ongoing support to \npower sector restructuring. In December 2006, ADB approved the Power Sector Development \nProgram4 with a primary objective of creating a competitive power sector by privatizing National \nPower  Corporation\u2019s  generation  assets  and  offering  concession  of  TransCo\u2019s  assets.  The \ncreditworthiness of the electricity off-takers, particularly of the electric cooperatives, has been \none  factor  affecting  private  investors\u2019  interest  in  the  generation  assets  of  National  Power \nCorporation. The TA and ensuing project will provide the needed public sector support to these \nelectric cooperatives to improve operating efficiency and prepare these electric cooperatives to \nparticipate in the WESM. Therefore, the proposed project to strengthen electric cooperatives is \na timely public sector operation to support ongoing power sector restructuring.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The TA will contribute to ensuring a sustainable, efficient, and secure power supply in \nrural areas of the country. As the outcome of the TA, the scope of the resulting project together \nwith  the  mitigation  measures  for  environmental  and  social  impacts,  and  financing  and \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2005.

Manila.  \n ", "4   \nimplementation  arrangements  will  be  prepared.  The  resulting  project  will  consolidate  and \nstrengthen the technical and financial capacity of the electric cooperatives particularly those \nnonviable  ones  to  provide  efficient,  adequate,  and  reliable  electric  service  at  reasonable \nelectricity rates.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The  TA  will  study  the  feasibility  and  determine  the  investment  and  institutional \nstrengthening requirements of the electric cooperatives in the following areas: \n \n(i)  distribution  system  upgrading  and  improvement  of  energy  efficiency \n(rehabilitation and upgrading substations/lines; efficient lighting), \n(ii)  acquisition of TransCo's subtransmission assets, \n(iii)  readiness of electric cooperatives to participate in wholesale electricity market \n(computerization, metering), and \n(iv)  options for credit enhancement mechanism including provision of partial credit \nguarantee and aggregation of power purchases by electric cooperatives and \nproviding training to the cooperatives for WESM trading.  \n \n16.  ADB will use the final TA outputs in considering the provision of a loan to NEA to meet \nthe investment requirements of electric cooperatives. The TA will produce the following outputs: \n \n(i)  assessment of financial and technical capacity and investment requirements of \nthe electric cooperatives in the next 5 years and required credit enhancement to \nparticipate in WESM, and selection of components suitable for ADB financing; \n(ii)  assessment  of  NEA\u2019s  financial  and  technical  capacity  to  channel  ADB\u2019s \nassistance to finance investment requirements of electric cooperatives; \n(iii)  assessment of procurement, environment, and social safeguard policies of NEA \nand electric cooperatives; and appropriate recommendations in accordance with \nADB policies; \n(iv)  project  cost  estimates,  financing  options,  which  may  include  local  currency \nfinancing, nonsovereign borrowing, multitranche financing facility, partial credit \nguarantee, etc.; \n(v)  economic and financial analyses of the selected project components, including \nanalyses of alternatives, rate of return, sensitivity, and risk; \n(vi)  confirmation of the environmental categorization of the project, and if necessary, \nan initial environmental evaluation for the project, including a summary initial \nenvironmental evaluation; and \n(vii)  social and poverty analysis and impact assessment of the proposed project, \nincluding  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans,  and  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment plans, if required. \n \n17.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environment Assessment \nGuidelines (2003), the TA will confirm the project categorization and prepare an appropriate \nenvironment document as required. To ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s social safeguard policies \nin Involuntary Resettlement (1995), Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), and Gender and \nDevelopment (1998), the TA will assess the resettlement and other impacts arising from the \nproject components and include these impacts and remedial measures in the resettlement plan. \nThe summary initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $786,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested that ADB provides $550,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. NEA will contribute the remaining $236,000 \nequivalent in kind, including office accommodation in Manila, counterpart staff remuneration, \nand secretarial support. NEA assured the availability of counterpart services, facilities, and \nfunds by the TA's expected commencement date. Details of the cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 3. The Government and NEA have been informed that approval of the TA \ndoes not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  NEA will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will work in close collaboration with the \nelectric  cooperatives  and  other  relevant  government  agencies.  NEA  will  assign  a  project \ncoordinator prior to contract negotiations, and counterpart staff to work with the consultants.  \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 8 months, from January 2008 to August 2008. ADB will \nengage a consulting firm in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants dated \nFebruary 2007, as amended from time to time. The simplified technical proposal and quality- \nand-cost-based selection procedures will be used in selecting the consulting firm. The TA will \nrequire 12 person-months of international and 32 person-months of national consulting services. \nThe  consultant  team  will  comprise  (i)  an  international  power  specialist  (team  leader)  with \nextensive  experience  in  rural  electrification  (8  person-months),  (ii)  an  international  project \nfinancing specialist (4 person-months), (iii) a national energy economist (8 person-months), (iv) \na national financial analyst (8 person-months), (v) a national social development specialist (8 \nperson-months), (vi) a national information technology specialist (6 person-months), and (vii) a \nnational  environment  specialist  (2  person  months).  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultants are in Appendix 4. The consultants will prepare inception, interim, draft final, and \nfinal reports, due in 4 weeks, 5 months, 7 months, and 8 months, respectively, after the services \nstart. Tripartite meetings of the NEA, consultant, and ADB will be held for the presentation and \nreview of the initial, interim, and draft final reports. \n \n21.  The TA final report will be disseminated to the public in accordance with ADB\u2019s Public \nCommunications Policy.5 \n \n22.  All computer models, databases, and training materials developed by the consultants \nincluding office equipment purchased during the TA will be transferred to NEA upon completion \nof the TA, and thereafter will remain the property of the Government. The copyright of any \nmaterials, software systems, or databases developed by the ADB TA consultants belongs to \nADB and will remain with ADB.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $550,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Philippines for preparing the Rural Electric Cooperatives Development \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2005.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nProvision of electricity throughout the country is one of the key tasks of the Government\u2019s Medium-Term Development \nStrategy. In line with its poverty reduction program, the Government of the Philippines aims to achieve 100% electrification of \nvillages by 2008. However, the technical and financial capacity of electric cooperatives is still inadequate to ensure quality \nsupply to consumers and expand the service, particularly in the context of deregulated power markets and the wholesale \nelectricity spot market (WESM).  The project will improve the technical and financial capacities of electric cooperatives that \nwill provide electricity to rural households.  \n \nB.    Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.    Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \nAs electricity is an input to most economic processes, it is an important component of economic development that is \nessential for poverty reduction. The PPTA will prepare an investment project to meet the electricity demand thus \npromoting economic growth in the country. \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.    If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \nNot applicable. \n \n2.    What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? \nA national social development analyst (8 person-months) is envisaged to undertake relevant poverty analysis. \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \nYes, the TA and ensuing project will target the nonviable rural electric cooperatives to provide quality and affordable \nelectricity to consumers. The poor consumers will benefit from subsidized lifeline rates and efficient lighting. \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.   Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? \nThe TA and ensuing project will target the nonviable rural electric cooperatives to provide quality and affordable \nelectricity to poor consumers.  \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \nWith access to electricity, the poor will enjoy better education, communication, health, comfort, convenience, and \nproductivity. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem? \nThe main constraint is the affordability of consumers. The project will improve the operational efficiency of rural electric \ncooperatives to lower the cost of provision of electricity. Furthermore, the poor consumers will benefit from subsidized \nlifeline rates. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.     Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \nThe potential stakeholders include the National Electrification Administration (NEA), rural electric cooperatives and the \nelectricity consumers and community-based organizations.  \n \n2.  What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops,  \n        community mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)? \nConsultation workshops will be organized with stakeholders during the TA to help in the project design and prepare a \nparticipation, consultation, and disclosure strategy for the project loan.   \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing         Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n4.

What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \nThere are no specific gender concerns. The provision of electricity will benefit all population including women. \n \n2.   Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision \nmaking?       Yes          No    The provision of electricity will benefit all population regardless of gender.  \n \n3.
