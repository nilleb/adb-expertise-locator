INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support developing member \ncountries (DMCs) by helping them maximize the benefits from the use of digital technology in \ndevelopment  programs.  It  will  contribute  to  the  overall  quality  of  project  design  and \nimplementation in operations by identifying digital development opportunities, providing advisory \nservices to project teams, and developing the capacity of DMCs in the digital transformation \nprocess. \n \n2.  As a key enabler of innovation, digital technology1 has opened new avenues for growth \nand  inclusive  development.2 The  Strategy  2030  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nrecognizes the promotion of innovative technology as one of its guiding principles for operations \nand committed to \u201cproactively seek ways to promote the use of advanced technologies across its \noperations and provide capacity building support to DMCs.\u201d3 Digital technology is also critical to \nthe achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,4 which ADB and its DMCs \nhave committed to support. Implementing the 2030 Agenda requires innovative technologies, \ninfrastructure, services, and solutions with vastly improved reach to meet the global targets of the \nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 5   \n \n3.  In this regard, the TA will build the foundation for a comprehensive plan of actions to scale \nup ADB\u2019s digital technology interventions in the implementation of Strategy 2030. The TA is \nincluded in the 2019 results-based workplan of the Sustainable Development and Climate Change \nDepartment (SDCC).6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  As a result of increasing global connectivity and mobility, digital technology is rapidly \ntransforming  products,  services,  businesses,  and  industries  in  diverse  fields.  Moreover,  its \npotential to support the development agenda is becoming increasingly apparent with implications \nfor improving the design, delivery, and monitoring of programs and projects across many sectors.  \nHowever, meeting the full potential of digital technology for development is not straightforward. \nRegulatory environments conducive to the spread of digital innovation often do not exist in DMCs, \nand more than half of the world\u2019s population\u2014the vast majority in the developing world\u2014lacks \naccess to the internet7 and, therefore, unable to participate in the digital economy.  \n                                                \n1  There is no clear distinction between information and communication technology (ICT) and digital technology. \u201cDigital \ntechnology\u201d is used to cover broader technology issues in the digital economy, whereas \u201cICT\u201d is used when it comes \nto specific information technology and communication technology. Digital technology is intentionally used to highlight \nits transformative role in the digital economy. However, the two terms could be interchangeable in many cases.  \n2  ADB. 2014. Innovative Asia: Advancing the Knowledge-Based Economy. Manila.  \n3  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n4  United Nations (UN) General Assembly. 2015. Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment.  Resolution A/70/1, adopted 25 September. New York. \n5   In 2015, the UN General Assembly adopted the outcome document on the World Summit on the Information Society \nthat underlined the importance of ICT for the achievement of the SDGs, and encouraged UN member countries and \ninternational organizations to align SDGs and the World Summit on Information Society\u2019s framework by highlighting \nthe role of ICT in achieving the SDGs. Specifically, the TA will contribute to the end of extreme poverty (SDG 1) and \nhunger (SDG 2), universal health coverage (SDG 3), universal secondary education (SDG 4), industry, innovation \nand infrastructure (SDG 9), sustainable cities (SDG11), combatting climate change (SDG 13), and legal identity for \nall and improving justice system (SDG 16) and partnerships for the goals (SDG 17). \n6  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 May 2019. \n7  According to the World Development Report 2016, nearly 2 billion people still do not own a mobile phone and nearly \n60% of the world\u2019s population has no access to the internet.  Globally, 21% of the poorest 40% of households do not \n \n   ", "2 \n \n5.  In addition to internet connectivity, other critical enabling factors in the economy that drive \nthe digital transformation process, such as appropriate regulations and policies, basic digital \nliteracy of citizens, and the workforce\u2019s digital skills, are often lacking to provide environment and \nincentive for the private sector to invest in digital technology products, and services, and create \nnew businesses in a country. These enabling factors boost private sector participation in the \ndigital economy, particularly in the early stages of digital transformation in DMCs, specifically in \nsectors or areas where the private sector is not willing to do business due to lack of commercial \nviability such as in rural and remote areas.  \n \n6.  Despite DMCs\u2019 aspirations for digital transformation, investments on digital technology for \ndevelopment are not always prioritized in the national and subnational plans, leading to forgone \nopportunities. Insufficient scoping studies on potential digital opportunities and inappropriate \nproject designs often result in sub-optimal benefits from digital development investments.  \n \n7.  In response to the growing demand for digital technology interventions in DMCs, ADB has \nincorporated digital technology components in ADB projects across sectors and regions. ADB has \napproved projects with a wide range of digital technology components8 in attempts to reduce life-\ncycle costs and increase durability, improve the efficiency and quality of services, and minimize \nnegative environmental and social impacts (footnote 3). During the period of 2010\u20132018, ADB \nhas supported a total of 315 projects that included digital components. Although the number of \nprojects with digital technology components in DMCs has increased, optimal benefits from digital \ntechnology interventions have not been fully realized with anticipated scale and speed. \n \n8.  In view of these barriers to DMCs\u2019 digital readiness, ADB approved the TA for Information \nand Communication Technology for Development Initiative for Asia and the Pacific in 20149 with \nthe  aim  to  increase  governments\u2019  capacity  to  identity  and  prepare  digital  development \ninvestments  in  DMCs.  This  TA  supported  the  DMCs  by:  (i)  undertaking  information  and \ncommunication technology (ICT) readiness assessment for DMCs as inputs for new country \npartnership strategies, (ii) preparing pre-feasibility studies on digital components in ADB projects, \n(iii) providing technical advisory support for ADB projects to develop concepts of potential digital \ncomponents, (iv) organizing knowledge sharing events, and (v) producing knowledge products. \nThe activities under the ongoing TA has been well-received by DMCs. Under this TA, more ADB \nprojects  than  originally  forecasted  have  been  supported.  The  outputs  were  timely  and \ninstrumental in: (i) developing the pipeline of digital development projects, (ii) improving the design \nquality of planned projects, and iii) building institutional capacity of relevant agencies for the digital \ntransformation process in DMCs. One of the key lessons from the implementation was that the \nongoing TA could have produced better results if its activities had been integrated in ADB \noperations more strategically and comprehensively across sectors and thematic areas in line with \nADB\u2019s strategies, taking into consideration the DMCs\u2019 readiness for digital transformation in \nprioritizing its activities.  \n \n                                                \nhave access to a mobile phone and 71% do not have access to the internet.  Women are less likely than men to use \nor  own  digital  technologies.  World  Bank.  2016.  World  Bank  Development  Report  2016:  Digital  Dividends.  \nWashington, D.C.   \n8  This  includes  loans,  grants,  and  TA  projects  across  the  sectors  and  thematic  areas  which  has  \n(a) ICT or digital technology components in its outputs as a main component, and (b) projects that are classified \nunder the \"ICT\" sector or as an ICT subsector according to the ADB's project classification system. The term of \n\u2018digital development project\u2019 will be used to indicate this kind of projects across the report.  \n9  ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance for Information and Communication Technology for Development Initiative Facility \nin Asia and the Pacific. Manila (TA-8813). \n ", "  3 \n9.  Building on the lessons, it is proposed that ADB support DMCs through the proposed TA \nby:  (i)  identifying  digital  development  opportunities,  (ii)  enhancing  design  quality  of  digital \ntechnology components in ADB projects, and (iii) improving the capacity of DMCs through \nknowledge activities. Through the new TA, digital components will be included in more ADB \nprojects, the design quality of the projects will be improved, and better outcomes from the use of \ndigital technology will be realized.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: national policies of DMCs in support of their \ndigital transformation developed. The TA will have the outcome: digital technology for ADB \noperations in line with Strategy 2030 promoted.10 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: Digital development opportunities in Strategy 2030 operational priorities \nidentified. Under this output, the TA team will develop a digital strategy or strategic framework \nfor selected sectors and thematic areas in line with the corresponding operational plans. The TA \nteam will also undertake diagnostic studies to identify digital development opportunities and \nnecessary regulatory reforms, in support of the country partnership strategy preparation. In \nparticular, the TA team will study possible ADB interventions, including sovereign or nonsovereign \nmodalities, to support the digital development agenda in DMCs, based on an assessment of \ncomparative advantages of the public sector vis-\u00e0-vis the private sector. The TA team will \ndetermine the target DMCs in close consultation with operations departments. Under this output, \nthe TA will support the following indicative activities:  \n(i)  conducting country diagnostic studies in support of ADB\u2019s new country partnership \nstrategies;  \n(ii)  developing strategic framework and action plans for smart-city initiatives in DMCs; \nand  \n(iii)  identifying digital opportunities in key areas of e-governance including national ID, \ndomestic resource management, cadastral, and land management.  \n \n12.  Output 2:  Design quality of digital technology components in selected projects \nenhanced. The TA team will provide direct technical support to ADB programs and projects to \nimprove the quality of project design (e.g., a short-term advisory service or pre-feasibility study to \nassess digital options for target projects covering financial sustainability, institutional capacity, \nand financing modality). In addition, the TA team will explore and incorporate innovative digital \ncomponents that are proven or successfully implemented in other projects at design stage. The \nTA team will also help obtain buy-in from stakeholders by supporting pre-feasibility study of digital \ninnovation. Under this output, the TA will support the following indicative projects, including \nprefeasibility studies:  \n(i)  applying blockchain technology in supply chain management, food safety, and \nagriculture product traceability in selected DMCs;  \n(ii)  applying digital technologies for smart-city projects including ICT applications for \nlocal governments in DMCs; and  \n(iii)  supporting  a  social  protection  management  information  system  development \nlinking it to national identification systems. \n \n                                                \n10  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \n13.  Output 3: Capacity of developing member countries on digital development through \nknowledge activities enhanced.  As digital technology rapidly grows and spreads, it is important \nto keep abreast of different trends, innovations, challenges, risks and threats, and to build \nappropriate capacity in order to effectively manage technology. Under this output, the TA team \nwill develop the necessary capacity of DMCs through trainings, seminars, workshops, and \nconferences, in collaboration with knowledge partners. These partnerships will be used to share \nand discuss country-specific or cross-regional research, expertise, experience, resources, and \nnetworks that may guide lending and technical assistance operations in DMCs.  The TA team will \nalso produce and disseminate knowledge products through ADB knowledge channels.11   \n \n14.  Partnerships will be established with international and regional networks, such as but not \nlimited to the Identity for Development Network,12 the GovTech Global Partnership,13 and the \nSmart City Network of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.14 A bilateral partnership with \nthe Seoul Housing Corporation will also be established.15 Through these partnerships, the TA \nteam will support the following indicative knowledge activities:  \n(i)  Digital Development Forum 2019, 2020, and 2021;  \n(ii)  Regional Workshop on Smart City 2020;  \n(iii)  Regional Workshop on Digital Technology for Agriculture 2021; and \n(iv)  Regional Workshop on e-Governance 2021. \n \n15.  The TA team will also invite internationally recognized experts in areas where demand is \nhigh and in priority operational areas. Along this line, ADB will establish an external Advisory \nGroup on Digital Technology16 which will provide strategic guidance on ADB\u2019s approach and \ndirection on the use of digital technologies in operations. The members will apply their expertise \nand insights on digital technology policies and applications relevant to the contexts in DMCs.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million, of which (i) $1.0 million will be financed by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources), and (ii) $500,000 will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  and  be \nadministered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n17.  The  estimate  covers  the  costs  of  (i)  consultant  services;  (ii)  direct  costs  of  TA \nimplementation, including international and local travel, monitoring and evaluation, reporting, and \nsupport for knowledge product development; (iii) diagnostic studies, prefeasibility studies, and \ntopic-related  studies,  as  may  be  required  by  operations  departments;  and  (iv)  workshops, \nseminars, training sessions, high-level meetings including those of the advisory group on digital \ntechnology, and annual fora for policy-makers in Asia and the Pacific and relevant ADB staff.  \n                                                \n11  May include the official ADB website, ADB social media accounts, e-newsletter of the Digital Technology for \nDevelopment Unit, and k-Learn. k-Learn is an online repository of learning materials from numerous conferences, \nseminars, and training programs that ADB conducts.  \n12 ADB joined the global partnership network on \u201cIdentity for Development\u201d including 15 international organizations in \n2017. \n13  ADB is considering the possibility of joining the World Bank-led GovTech Global Partnership. \n14  Launched in 2018, the ASEAN Smart Cities Network is a collaborative platform which aims to synergize Smart city \ndevelopment efforts across ASEAN. \n15 ADB and Seoul Housing Corporation, a leading public enterprise responsible for housing welfare under the Seoul \nMetropolitan Government, plan to enter into a partnership agreement and co-organize a workshop on smart city in \n2019. \n16 The Advisory Group on Digital Technology is composed of experts and eminent leaders in the field of digital \ntechnology. They will convene annually. \n \n ", "  5 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will administer the TA and will be the executing agency. SDCC will implement the TA \nfor 40 months, from September 2019 to December 2022, in close coordination with the operations \ndepartments, the Office of Public-Private Partnership, and the sector and thematic groups.
