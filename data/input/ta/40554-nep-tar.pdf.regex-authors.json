During the Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in July \n2006, the Government of Nepal requested project preparatory technical assistance (TA) to \ndesign a rural reconstruction and rehabilitation project. ADB granted the Government's request \nand  included  the  TA  in  its  Country  Operations  and  Business  Plan  for  2007\u20132009.1 The \nGovernment further requested ADB to develop and finance a sustainable rural reconstruction \nand rehabilitation sector development program. \n \n2.  The ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Nepal from 8 to 14 December 2006 and consulted \nwith  representatives  of  the  Government,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and \ndevelopment partner agencies. The Mission visited two rural road schemes in Kavre valley and \ndiscussed with beneficiaries the  impacts on employment generation. The Mission discussed \nwith the NGO forum and shared proposed program activities with NGOs. The Mission presented \nits findings to the development partners and explored cofinancing prospects. This report  is \nbased on the Mission\u2019s findings and understanding reached with the Government on the \npurpose, outputs, methodology, key activities, cost and financing, implementation arrangements, \nand terms of reference for the TA. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  With a per capita gross domestic product of $270 per year (2004 data), Nepal is one of \nthe poorest countries in the region. Out of the country's population of 24 million people, 31% live \nbelow the poverty line.  Geographically, the incidence of poverty is more severe in rural areas \n(35%)  than in the urban areas (10%).  Over time, poverty incidence has declined at a rate of \nabout 1% a year from 42% countrywide in FY1996 to its current level of about 31%. While a \nnumber of social indicators of poverty have shown an uptrend recently, substantial scope exists \nfor further improvement as shown by the fact that only 14% of the population have access to \nelectricity, 16% to sanitation, 23% to paved roads, 41% to health services, 71% to drinking \nwater; and only 38%  are literate.  As enunciated in its  Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper2 \n(PRSP), Nepal has placed a priority on poverty reduction in its various development programs. \n \n4.  The root cause of poverty in Nepal is the lack of economic opportunity, aggravated by \nlack of connectivity between the rural communities that predominate nationwide and the areas \nthat could provide economic opportunities to the rural population. About 36% of the country's \ntotal population live at least  2 hours walk from the nearest all-season road. The inadequate \naccess  to  public  services  has  effectively  isolated  farming  communities  from  sources  of \nadvanced technologies such as fertilizers and high-yielding seeds. Under such a situation, farm \nvisits by agricultural extension agents are few and far between; marketing of farm produce also \nbecomes challenging.  Mothers and growing children in particular suffer due to lack of access to \nhealth services, which are invariably available only in larger towns. The degree of isolation is \neven greater for women and disadvantaged ethnic groups and castes in rural areas.  \n \n5.  The Government has taken remedial measures to address the problem of isolation, \nexclusion,  and  connectivity  to  public  services  as  enunciated  in  its  Local  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Policy3 (LIDP). To improve access to public services in the rural areas, the LIDP \nstipulates the devolution to local bodies such as the district development committees (DDCs) \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 30 November 2006. \n2  National Planning Commission. 2002. Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper/Tenth Plan. Kathmandu \n3  Ministry of Local Development. 2004. Local Infrastructure Development Policy. Kathmandu.   \n ", "2   \nand village development committees (VDCs) of the tasks of planning, designing, constructing, \nand maintaining local infrastructure. The devolution is seen as an effective way to foster a sense \nof ownership and strong commitment of local governing units and direct users of the facilities, \nwhich is expected to result in cost-effective operation and maintenance of such facilities. \n \n6.  The current drive toward decentralization is guided by the Local Self-Governance Act, \npromulgated in 1999. The large number of DDCs (75 nationwide), municipalities (58), and VDCs \n(3,913),  and  the  numerous  technical  staff  need  to  be  fielded  in  the  course  of  devolving \ndevelopment authority from the central to the local level, have posed a great challenge to the \nvarious line ministries of the Government. In a number of cases where the needed expertise is \nnot available at the local level, line ministries have resorted to temporary deputation of their staff. \nAlthough  the  institutional  strengthening  component  under  the  ongoing  ADB-assisted \nDecentralized Rural Infrastructure and Livelihood Project (DRILP)4 contributes to enhancing the \ncapacities of members of DDCs and VDCs, institutional reforms on decentralization are urgently \nrequired for undertaking better service delivery at the local level by focusing on devolved \ngovernance, inclusiveness, accountability and transparency, effectiveness, and equity.  \n \n7.  The signing of the peace accord in November 2006 between the Seven-Party Alliance \nand the Communist Party of Nepal\u2013Maoist, and the resulting cessation of hostilities in the \ncountryside present an excellent opportunity for the Government to restore and rehabilitate the \nrural infrastructure that have fallen into disrepair during the decade-long conflict. As demands \nfor  investment  funds  are  high  and  in  many  cases  urgent,  the  Government is prioritizing \ninvestment projects to satisfy the maximum number of people with competing needs. As the \nPRSP will be completed in July 2007, the Government is formulating a 3-year development plan \nfor the interim period, an  interim plan for  FY2007\u2013FY2009.5 The interim plan will adopt  a \nstrategy of quick-disbursement modality including grants to rural communities for reconstruction \nand development activities by implementing development programs at the local level through \naccelerated decentralization and reconstitution of the DDC and VDCs.6  \n \n8.  Preparing a program ensuing from the TA will be guided by experience gained in \nimplementing various projects in the rural infrastructure sector funded by ADB and development \npartners,  in  particular,  from  the  ongoing  DRILP.  Lessons  include  the  following:  (i)  local \nparticipation  is  essential  to  ensure  success  in  planning,  designing  implementing,  and \nmaintaining rural infrastructure projects; (ii)  although the decentralization process has been \ninitiated, DDC/VDC implementation capacity will be strengthened only when real devolution of \nauthority takes place; (iii) the criteria for selecting  subprojects, once agreed upon, should be \nadhered to closely so as to replace the ad hoc, often political, prioritization procedures of the \npast; (iv) the wide variation in the terrain and in social conditions across subproject sites dictates \nsome measure of flexibility in designing subprojects; and (v) strict adherence to standard \ndesigns and specifications across various districts of the country should be waived as warranted. \n \n9.  In line with the Government\u2019s strategy for rural infrastructure development, and ADB's    \ncountry assistance plan and operational strategy, the program resulting from the proposed TA \nwill help Nepal realize broad-based economic growth. This goal would be achieved  not only \nthrough improvements in access of rural communities to basic social services through direct \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2004.

Manila (Loan 2092-NEP and TA 43-97-NEP, approved on 24 September). \n5  The interim plan will comprise various strategy-specific plans based on the four-pillar strategy of the Tenth Plan, \nincluding economic growth, rural infrastructure reconstruction and rehabilitation, social inclusion, and governance.    \n6  The TA will support the strategy of quick disbursement for rural infrastructure reconstruction at DDC/VDC level. \n ", "  3 \ninvestments in rural roads and related infrastructure, but also through policy and institutional \nreform for  building capacity and enhancing local governance to boost the poverty effect of \ninfrastructure, and to more directly benefit marginalized and disadvantaged ethnic groups and \ncastes in rural areas. As the Government requested to have a flexible lending modality for a \nquick-disbursement  approach  to  deliver  immediate  assistance  in  the  reconstruction, \nrehabilitation, and peace-building effort, the sector development program modality was selected, \ncomprising investment and policy reform components.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA aims to help the Government prepare a sector development program that will \npromote rural rehabilitation, economic growth and poverty reduction, particularly in remote areas, \nthrough policy and institutional reforms, and rural infrastructure investment in accordance with \nthe  LIDP  prepared  by  the  National  Planning  Commission  (NPC)  in  2004  and  the  rural \ninfrastructure action plan currently being prepared by the Department of Local Infrastructure \nDevelopment and Agricultural Roads (DOLIDAR). The TA will also help the Government provide \nopportunities for increased income to residents in conflict-affected areas by employing them in \nthe construction of rural roads and other rural infrastructure. The outcome of the TA will be the \nagreed-upon design of a program with the Government.  \n \n11.  The TA outputs will include (i) an investment plan for reconstruction and rehabilitation of \nrural  roads,  and  other  infrastructure, 7  (ii)  a  policy  reform  matrix,  (iii)  implementation \narrangements, and (iv) an assessment of the feasibility of the investment component package. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented by means of a participatory process involving extensive \nconsultations with stakeholders in relation to the planning, design, and implementation of rural \ninfrastructure under the Government\u2019s rural infrastructure investment plan (RIIP), which is being \nprepared and will be presented to the Nepal Development Forum in 2007. In addition to the \nparticipatory consultations, the TA will assist the Government\u2019s leadership in developing the \ninvestment packages with active participation of the development partners. The TA will have \nfour key components: (i) review of a draft Government RIIP, (ii) sector analysis and preparation \nof a  policy matrix, (iii)  design of implementation arrangements, and (iv) assessment of the \nfeasibility of the investment package.  \n \n13.  Review  the  Rural  Infrastructure  Investment  Plan.  The  TA  will  review  the \nGovernment\u2019s draft RIIP, which is expected to be discussed at a workshop in February 2007. \nOn the basis of  the plan, suitable subprojects will be prioritized in line with agreed-upon \nscreening criteria and packaged into an investment project suitable for ADB financing. In \naddition, the Government\u2019s rural development strategy will be examined to address the post-\nconflict  circumstances.  The  District  Transport  Master  Plan  prepared  by  DOLIDAR  will  be \nsimilarly reviewed to guide the packaging of the investment project at a district level. Lessons \nfrom completed and ongoing projects financed by ADB and other development partners will be \nexamined. 8    \n                                                 \n7  For possible inclusion of water supply and sanitation, micro-irrigation, and micro-hydropower.  \n8  ADB. 2003.

Undertake Sector Analysis and Prepare the Policy Matrix. The TA will (i) undertake a \ncomprehensive sector analysis, covering policy and institutional gaps and constraints; and (ii) \ndetermine whether the existing and envisaged policy framework and institutional development \nplan form an appropriate basis for ADB support. Based on the review of the RIIP, the TA will \nprepare the medium- and long-term development framework and the schedule of policy steps \nfor an acceptable policy reform program to be undertaken during the program period.     \n \n15.  Design the Implementation Arrangements. The TA will review the Local Governance \nAct of 1999 to ensure clear delineation  of powers and decision making between the central \nGovernment,  DDCs,  and  VDCs  to  identify  any  need  for  revising  the  Act  to  meet  the \nimplementation arrangements under the new Interim Constitution. The implementation strategy \nwill  adopt  a  decentralized,  demand-driven,  community-based  approach.  The  decentralized \nmechanism for public services delivery would include mechanisms for monitoring investment \nprograms. In addition, the TA will define the financing modality for subprojects and clarify \nprocedures for expediting the flow of funds from the central to local bodies. DDC capabilities in \nfinancial  management  as  well  as  the  technical  aspects  of  designing  and  implementing \nsubprojects will be assessed and remedial measures proposed. The implementation framework \nwill be discussed at the workshop on the overall findings of the TA.  \n \n16.  Assess the Feasibility of the Investment Project Package. The TA will formulate an \ninvestment project suitable for ADB financing, and carry out the preparatory studies required to \nexamine the feasibility of each subproject. Initially five core subprojects representing the totality \nof all subprojects will be examined in detail. The assessments will cover (i) compliance with \nADB\u2019s safeguard and other policies, (ii) economic and financial analyses, (iii) poverty and social \nassessment, (iv) a monitoring and evaluation system, (v) environmental and social impacts, (vi) \na resettlement framework and core subproject resettlement plans, and (vii) an indigenous \npeoples development framework and/or development plans, as required. An initial poverty and \nsocial  analysis  is  in  Appendix  2.  The  investment  plan  will  be  discussed  with  potential \ncofinanciers,  such  as  the  World  Bank,  United  Kingdom\u2019s  Department  for  International \nDevelopment (DFID), Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC), as well as other development \npartners in Nepal.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent, of which the Government \nrequested ADB to finance $500,000. The TA will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by ADB\u2019s \ntechnical assistance funding program. The Government will finance the remaining $100,000 \nequivalent to cover the costs of counterpart staff, office accommodation and utilities, and office \nequipment. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto finance any ensuing program. Further details of the cost estimates are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The  Ministry  of  Local  Development  (MLD)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  A  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) will be established under MLD. The PMU will be headed by a project \ndirector at the level of joint secretary, who will be responsible for day-to-day TA implementation \n                                                                                                                                                             \nLoan and a Technical Assistance Grant to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Decentralized Rural Infrastructure and \nLivelihood Project.

A steering \ncommittee will be chaired by a member (infrastructure) of NPC. Secretaries of MLD, Ministry of \nWater Resources, Ministry of Physical Planning and Works, Ministry of General Administration, \nMinistry of Environment, Science and Technology, and Ministry of Finance will be members of \nthe steering committee. The TA implementation modality needs to be flexible in order to include \nother line ministries that may be required during the TA implementation period.  \n \n19.  The secretary of MLD will provide overall guidance to the PMU and review and endorse \nall the consultants\u2019 recommendations and suggestions to be made part of the TA outputs. An \nADB project specialist will work closely with MLD in supervising the consultants and monitoring \nTA progress. Under the PMU, two full-time persons will be assigned to administer the TA \nactivities. As the Executing Agency will carry out training, seminars, and conferences, an \nadvance-payment facility will be established and the whole budget allocation will not be under \nthe consultants\u2019 contract.  \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over  4 months from February to June 2007. Individual \nconsultants will be engaged by ADB for a total of 56 person-months in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from time to time). Two international \nconsultants for 7 person-months will be recruited: a rural development specialist/team leader \nand a project economist. Sixteen national consultants will be recruited to serve for a total of 49 \nperson-months; they will include (i) a participatory planning specialist, (ii) a poverty reduction \nspecialist, (iii) a local governance specialist, (iv)  a financial management specialist, (v) an \nenvironment specialist, (vi) a social development specialist, (vii) a resettlement specialist, (viii) a \nmonitoring and impact evaluation specialist, (ix) five rural road engineers, (x) a rural water \nsupply and sanitation specialist, and (xi) two other rural infrastructure specialists for the sectors, \nwhich could possibly be selected in the area of  architectural designs, irrigation, alternative \nenergy, telecommunication, and airports. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 4. As the TA needs to be urgently implemented as per the Government\u2019s request, \nadvance contracting for recruiting individual consultants will be allowed. The Government was \ninformed that ADB\u2019s approval of advance contracting, and retroactive financing, if any, do not \ncommit  ADB  to  subsequently  approve  the  program.  The  equipment  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006, as amended from time to time), and will \nbe handed over to the MLD on completion of the TA.   \n \n21.  The team leader of the consultants will submit an inception report, which will summarize \nthe activities related to mobilization and succeeding preparatory works and, as needed, discuss \nchanges in the agreed-upon approach, methodology, or work plan, as well as the overall cost \nimplications of the TA. Monthly progress reports and interim reports will be submitted by the \nconsultants to MLD and ADB for effective monitoring of TA progress. The consultants will \norganize (i) five regional workshops, one in each region covered by the TA; and (ii) two national \nworkshops in Kathmandu to advise stakeholders of findings under the TA and to solicit their \ncomments thereon. After each workshop, a report summarizing the input, output, and outcomes \nwill be submitted. The final TA report, including a project proposal in ADB format, will be \nsubmitted after reflecting the comments of the Government and ADB on the draft final report.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Nepal for preparing the Rural Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Sector \nDevelopment Program, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPreliminary Program Framework \n       \n  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks \n  Mechanisms   \n \nImpact       Assumptions \nImproved rural  By end of program, the rural  Monitoring and  1.

The country\u2019s economic growth rate of around 4%  over the past years barely exceeded the population growth rate, \nwhich increased from 2.1% in 1991 to 2.3% in 2001. Although poverty declined sharply, falling from 42% in 1996 to 31% in \n2004, the decline was driven by increases in remittances, higher agricultural wages, increased connectivity, and a decline in \ndependency ratio. However, much of the growth accrued largely to the middle and upper class urban households; as a result \ninequality between the rich and the poor widened. Disparities in levels of poverty and human development indicators exist \nbetween different development regions and between rural and urban areas. The decade-long conflict that started in the mid \nwest imposed the heaviest toll in districts with the highest poverty and poor infrastructure and development indicators. Lack \nof opportunity, rising expectations, and grievances against the government in terms of service delivery are key factors \ncontributing to the spread of the insurgency.  \n \nInequality in access to resources, power relations, and cultural and social interest have sustained unequal access to \neconomic opportunity and social resources. As a result, disparities in income and social indicators remain highly pronounced \nat regional, urban-rural, gender, and ethnic/caste levels. This disparity has systematically kept away large segments of the \nrural people from participating in development initiatives. The growing rural impoverishment, the lack of self-employment \nopportunities, and fragmentation of land into nonviable farm units have transformed subsistence farms into wage-dependent \nhouseholds. Thus, Nepal faces the dual challenges of accelerating growth and sharing it more broadly across the population. \nThe effect of investments in rural development works is expected to be pro-poor as the benefits of infrastructure are \ncapitalized  primarily  through  increased  shares  of  nonfarm  employment.  Improving  rural  connectivity  and  physical \ninfrastructure will open up more rewarding job opportunities, and improve access to basic services such as schools and \nhealth facilities for populations living in distant and scattered settlements not yet reached by support services such as \ntechnology, extension, and market access. The project preparatory technical  assistance (TA) envisages the preparation of  \nan investment package that will provide the rural population with new opportunities for rural employment, increase income, \nexpand access to rural infrastructure to enable the rural population to access affordable basic services while assisting them \nto rebuild their lives. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                     Targeting Classification: General intervention  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nPockets of poverty coincide with the distribution of occupational castes and ethnic minorities. Country-wise, the incidence of \npoverty is higher among Tibeto-Burman-speaking ethnic minorities such as the Limbus, Magars, Tharus, and Tamangs, and  \ndisadvantaged occupational castes, many  of whom inhabit areas where cultivation conditions are marginal, rainfall  is \nvariable, and service infrastructure and market access  are less developed.  The family size of ethnic minorities and \ndisadvantaged groups is higher than the national average; their participation in political life, decision-making bodies and \ngovernment civil services is low; and support services remain inaccessible to them. Population density between the districts \nis variable with the eastern Terai having the highest population density at 365 per square kilometer, more than double the \naverage population density of 158 persons per square kilometer. The majority of the poor are food-sufficient for no more than \n6 months a year, and are forced to migrate out as wage laborers. \n \nGiven that labor is the primary asset of landless and wage-dependent households, rural poverty has prevailed in rural wage \nearning households. New strategy that encourages increased and diversified local employment will be identified to address \nthe high incidence of poverty. It is necessary for a clear understanding of how rural households structure, their livelihood and \nincome base. In addition, the nature of households\u2019 dependence on rural and urban sources of income and risk management \nwill need to be assessed during the TA, and elements of pro-poor growth identified for incorporation into the project design. \n \nThe TA will ensure that the benefits accrue to all including the poor, women, ethnic groups, and other disadvantaged groups; \nidentify mechanisms to link resource-rich areas with resource-poor areas; identify where growth and organic development of \nnetworks between and within districts are taking place; and determine what measures are needed to support these growth \ncorridors (capacity building and investment), and chart out priority areas of support and implementation modality that \naddresses reconstruction and rehabilitation needs of  the country.  The project design will be based on social inclusion of \ndifferent ethnic groups and castes, community-based participatory approaches to promote ownership of the process, gender \nsensitivity, and accountability of local bodies and their leaders for transparent management of resources. \n ", "Appendix 2  9 \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nSince  stakeholders  influence  the  achievement  of  project  objectives,  the  TA  will  identify  at  the  outset  all  potential \nstakeholders. They include government (central and district line agencies), local bodies,  nongovernment organizations, \nindigenous groups, women, disadvantaged groups, and locally based civil society organizations. The TA will assist in \nidentifying individuals to represent the various stakeholder groups and ensure that all are represented and that there is \ngender balance in the consultations. The TA will assess the institutional capacity of these stakeholders so as to define what \nrole each stakeholder group is best equipped to  play, agree on how best to engage them, and determine the type of \nparticipation for each group. At least one stakeholder consultation per development region district is envisaged. The \nstakeholder analyses and participation strategy will be adopted in preparing resettlement plans.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nD.  Gender and Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen's control over financial resources is severely limited as evidenced by the low land (10%) and home ownership rates \n(6%) for women and this impacts negatively on their decision-making role in strategic areas related to development. The \ncountry\u2019s gender development index (GDI) of 0.51 has improved vis-a-vis the human development index (HDI) of 0.53. \nHowever, the magnitude of gender inequality in HDI indicators is acute in the rural areas. This creates gaps and imbalances \nin the application and use of knowledge and skills. About two thirds of Nepali women are classified as illiterate, compared \nwith one third of the men.  Similarly, the number of years of schooling for females is only about half that of males.  \n \nGender-based poverty has been intensified by the ongoing conflict. Widow-headed households and farm-related work burden \nhave increased dramatically because male members have left the villages. Increasingly, women are being recruited as active \nparticipants.  It is reported that every third insurgent is a woman and that 70% of women insurgents are from ethnic groups. \nThe reason for women\u2019s increased involvement in Maoist activities is their perception that conflict is the only means to \nchange their situation in the society and gain self-esteem and confidence. Women\u2019s low social status leaves them vulnerable \nto gender-based violence, in the household and outside, and has devastating impacts on their morale and confidence, driving \nthem into trafficking and other precarious circumstances.  \n \nThe Tenth Plan adopts gender mainstreaming as a strategy to maximize development impacts on women and to promote \ngreater gender equity.  The TA will prepare a gender action plan with targets for women\u2019s participation and define how \ngender-responsive and inclusive processes may be strengthened. \nHas an output been prepared?
