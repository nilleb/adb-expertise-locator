INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Parliament of Mongolia adopted the Regional Development Concept (RDC) in June \n2001 (Resolution No. 57) to redress regional imbalances and achieve integrated development \ntoward  a  market  economy.  During  the  2001  Country  Programming  Mission  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), the Government of Mongolia (the Government) requested ADB for \nadvisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  strengthen  its  policy,  planning,  and  implementation \nstrategies for the RDC, including the capacity to link physical spatial development with economic \ndevelopment. Subsequently, ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update (2002\u20132004) included \nthis TA1 in the 2002 Program. ADB fielded a fact-finding mission in August 2002 and held \ndiscussions with staffs of government agencies, relevant research institutions, and international \nagencies concerned, and reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, \nscope, cost estimates, terms of reference, and implementation arrangements for the TA. The TA \nframework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  More than half of Mongolia is under frost for almost 6 months of the year, while the \nsouthern part is mostly semiarid desert. The Siberian steppe, between the frost zone and the \nGobi desert, forms an east-west corridor along which the nomadic Mongolians tend to move while \ngrazing their livestock. Nomadic way of life is still an important part of the economy. About one-\nthird of the population is nomadic, another one-third is concentrated in the capital, Ulaanbaatar, \nand the rest live in 21 provincial towns across the country. Significant mineral reserves are largely \nlocated along the north-south corridor of the Trans-Siberian Railway, the backbone of industrial \nactivity and international trade. Given the vast territory, small population, remote cities and towns, \nand poorly developed infrastructure, the costs of providing social services and improving living \nstandards are high, making it very difficult for the Government to implement an effective poverty \nreduction strategy.  \n \n3.   In  the  centrally  planned  economy,  the  locations  of  settlements  (and  thus  transport \nnetworks) were artificially defined by the administrative structure.2 Most trade flows before 1990 \nwere oriented toward the former Soviet Union. The collapse of the former Soviet Union led to a \ndrastic reduction in subsidies and trading. The artificial hierarchy of settlements, which depended \ncompletely on financial support from the central Government, started to show major weaknesses. \nAs market forces develop, the hierarchy of settlements and transport networks defined by the \nadministrative structure cannot efficiently support the actual flows of goods or of people, who tend \nto migrate to the central provinces and Ulaanbaatar. The Government is therefore faced with the \nchallenging task of formulating a sound development policy that balances ecological and physical \ninfrastructure constraints and economic development trends, while respecting the deeply rooted \nnomadic culture. \n \n4.  Aware of the constraints as well as the needs of a market economy, the Government drew \nup and adopted the RDC. It redefines regional boundaries by regrouping the 21 provinces into\n                                                 \n1  The TA was first listed in the ADB Business Opportunities (internet version) on 2 May 2002. \n2  Currently,  Mongolia  has  21  provinces  (including  the  cities  of  Erdhenet,  Darhan,  Choir,  and  the  capital  city \nUlaanbaatar), 346 soums (districts), and 1,681 bags (villages). Before 1990, the flow of raw materials such as \nminerals, meat, wool, and cashmere from districts to provincial capitals, from provincial capitals to Ulaanbaatar and \nthen to the former Soviet Union, then the major trading partner of Mongolia, provided a suitable hierarchical \nsettlement structure.  ", "2 \nfive economic regions,3 taking into account the local natural endowment, population and livestock \nlocations,  crop  production,  processing  industry,  tourism  potential,  and  revenue  generating \ncapabilities of the regions. The objective is to foster more balanced regional development within \nand across regions by speeding up economic and social development; supporting social progress \nthrough the efficient use of natural, mineral, and agricultural resources in line with the capabilities \nof each region; and attaining a more even distribution of the population and economic activities \nacross  the  regions  instead  of  their  present  concentration  in  Ulaanbaatar.  The  RDC  simply \nprovides a set of principles; a policy, strategies, and implementable plans still have to be \ndeveloped. Further detailed planning is necessary to (i) establish free trade and economic zones; \n(ii) establish and sustain pastoral livestock farming in all regions; (iii) develop regional centers to \nlink external and internal markets, urban-rural areas, and free trade zones; (iv) strengthen east-\nwest  and  north-south  transportation  networks  to  connect  regions  and  external  markets;  (v) \nreorganize the administrative system to suit the new development framework; and (vi) expand \nand improve infrastructure, including railways, highways, air transportation, power generation \nsystems, social services, financial banking system, and telecommunication systems. Despite the \nRDC\u2019s aim of developing a market economy, however, the RDC is based on central planning, as \nevidenced by the emphasis it gives to a physical infrastructure blueprint and its lack of critical \nanalysis or assessment of the social and economic implications. This is largely due to inadequate \nknowledge  of  market  economy  principles  and  the  shortage  of  experienced  staff  in  the \nGovernment for policy development and strategic planning\u2014a significant constraint on Mongolia\u2019s \nability to move its market economy forward. \n \n5.  The RDC covers a broad range of economic development issues, but sector strategies \nand guidelines are currently formulated in a fragmented manner by different ministries. The \nMinistry  of  Infrastructure  focuses  on  the  human  settlement  hierarchy,  particularly  physical \nplanning and infrastructure development, and does not analyze economic trends, needs, and cost \nrecovery  in  detail.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economy  (MOFE)  functions  as  general \ncoordinating ministry yet works in a relatively piecemeal manner. Very few of its staff are trained \nfor  integrated  policy  formulation,  planning,  and  programming.  For  efficient  planning  and \ninvestment decision making, the policy analysis capacities of MOFE as well as the mechanism for \ninstitutional  coordination  must  be  strengthened  to  enable  policymakers  to  make  informed \ndecisions based on thorough and objective analyses. A sustainable institution that integrates \npolicy analysis and strategic planning must be set up. \n \n6.  Before preparing the RDC in 1999 the Government had drawn up long-term action \nprograms with the help of multilateral and bilateral agencies.4 But the RDC made these obsolete. \nWhat is needed is a more structured, organized, and rational approach to regional development \nthat  coordinates  the  various  policy  initiatives,  plans,  and  sectoral  studies,  and  adequately \nprioritizes  development  needs  and  areas  of  foreign  assistance  on  the  basis  of  a  realistic \nassessment of their financial viability. \n \n                                                 \n3  The five regions are Western (Bayan-Ulgii, Govi-Altai, Khovd, Uvs, and Zavkhan provinces); Hangai (Arkhangai, \nBayankhonogor,  Bulgan,  Khovsgol,  Orkhon,  and  Uvrkhangai  provinces);  Central  (Darkhan-Uul,  Dornogovi, \nDundgovi, Govisumber, Omnogovi, Selenge, and Tov provinces); Eastern (Dornod, Khentii, and Sukhbaatar, \nprovinces); and Ulaanbaatar (the capital city and satellite cities in the vicinity). \n4  A study assisted by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the \u201cMongolian Action Program for the \n21st Century (MAP-21),\u201d offers a blueprint for socially equitable and environmentally sustainable development for the \n21st century. It is largely a compilation of local action programs from 18 provinces and four cities and requires further \nelaboration according to the country\u2019s new development direction. Another UNDP-assisted study, done in 1999, \ncritically examined regional development opportunities in Mongolia by reviewing the experiences of Australia, \nEuropean Union, Japan, United States of America, and central and eastern Europe. Japan International Cooperation \nAgency also carried out a medium-term development strategy and public investment program in 1999. ", "  3 \n7.  The RDC currently stands as a statement of the Government\u2019s intent to achieve balanced \nregional development, but it needs to be based on a critical assessment of economic and \nfinancial realities toward market-oriented development. The TA will help make the shift from a \ncentral planning paradigm to an approach that reflects economic realities and the market demand \nfor development investment, and give the Government a better understanding of its role as an \nenabler, not a controller, of the economy. The Government has confirmed that it will consider \namending or adjusting the RDC if the TA shows it to be financially or economically unviable. By \nstrengthening the country\u2019s development capacity, the TA is therefore an essential step toward \nthe efficient implementation of the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n8.  The overall goal of the TA is to support balanced and equitable regional development. The \nTA aims to strengthen the capacity of the Government for policy analysis and development \nmanagement, and to help establish systematic and structured development planning functions. \nThe immediate objectives of the TA are to help the Government (i) assess the economic rationale \nand financial viability of the RDC by preparing an integrated medium-term development strategy, \n(ii) strengthen the capacity of the regional policy and planning staff of the Government to do their \nwork on the basis of market principles, and (iii) prepare operating guidelines for the establishment \nof a department (potentially under MOFE) that will function as a policy development \u201cthink tank.\u201d \nThe TA is expected to deliver an integrated medium-term development plan and strategies, \ntraining modules for policy analysts and planners of the Government, and recommendations for \nestablishing an independent policy development unit that will help policymakers make informed \npolicy decisions based on sound analyses. Findings and recommendations will be discussed in \nparticipatory  workshops  involving  government officials, nongovernment organizations, private \nsector representatives, and academics, and will be disseminated through a series of conferences. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA has four components. \n \n10.  Component A will enhance the economic foundation of the RDC and strengthen public \npolicy analysis. Its four subcomponents will do the following: \n \n(i)  Review, analyze, and assess regional development issues in the context of the \ncountry\u2019s vast land areas, extremely low population densities, and deeply rooted \nnomadic agriculture. Assess the economic basis for the interrelationships among \nthe existing policies, plans, and strategies. Examine the strengths, weaknesses, \nand opportunities for market competitiveness of national and regional economies, \ngiven their natural, physical, and human resources.  \n(ii)  Compile a unified document and information relevant to the RDC and policy, using \ndocuments already prepared by government, nongovernment organizations, and \ninternational agencies, to assist in systematic and structured planning.  \n(iii)  On the basis of the confirmed market competitiveness and economic rationale, \nprioritize investment areas by appropriate time frame and by geographical focus, \nconsidering economic perspectives and poverty reduction impact.  \n(iv)  Review and examine draft or existing legal frameworks, and propose necessary \namendments to promote coherent regional development. ", "4 \n \n11.  Component B will provide training. Government officials will be trained overseas to \nenable them to review and analyze policy options in a market-based economy and give policy \nadvice at the highest levels. Short-term training programs will be prepared for three levels of \ngovernment  staff,  considering  their  functions  and  roles:  high  level  decision  makers,  senior \npolicymakers, and technical policy analysts. \n \n12.  Component C will help prepare a medium-term integrated regional development plan, \nincluding implementation strategies and operational guidelines. The plan will be prepared by \ngovernment staff, with the assistance of the TA consultants, as part of on-the-job training. Market-\nbased economic theories, principles, and planning methodology will be used in preparing a \nconcrete  development  intervention,  integrating  regional  development  plans,  and  formulating \ntarget development indicators for each region.  \n \n13.  Component D will include the conduct of seminars and workshops to (i) promote public \nparticipation, and (ii) disseminate policy briefs to improve public awareness, in public policy \nformulation,  implementation,  and  assessment.  The  seminars  and  workshops  will  adopt  the \nparticipatory approach to make the best possible use of local government capacities, knowledge, \nand experience. \n \n14.  Implementable strategies and programs will be developed in a two-step activity. First, the \nTA team will work closely with key central agencies and the representatives of regional and \nprovincial governors in reviewing, assessing, and prioritizing the programs proposed under the \nRDC. Then the TA team will develop a realistic and implementable plan and give feedback to the \ncentral agencies. An integrated and process-oriented planning approach with built-in participatory \nworkshops will be used to develop the skills of government officials and build commitment to the \nfinal  strategies  chosen.  The  implementation  of  all  the  components  will  be  closely  linked. \nComponent C will be carried out after the completion of components A and B, to take into account \nthe outcomes of macro-level prioritization and ensure the participation of the trained personnel. \nComponent D will be carried out throughout the TA implementation period to reflect experience \ngained during the overall planning and coordination under components A, B, and C, and to \nestablish an adequate institutional framework for an independent development planning body. \nAlso,  after  a  careful  study  of  laws  and  regulations  on  urban  and  regional  development, \namendments necessary to ensure a coherent legal framework will be recommended. Component \nD will be undertaken on a quarterly basis, to report major policy issues, outcomes of draft policy \nstudies, and to solicit recommendations and opinions of the steering committee and the public. \n \n15.  For  the  TA  to  succeed,  the  Government  must  closely  coordinate  between  member \nagencies; openly carry out dialogue with the TA consultants; and, on the basis of the results of \ncomponent A, reevaluate the need to strengthen further the proposed policies and programs. \nOutcomes and recommendations will be based on an objective technical assessment. To this \nend, the Government must assure the TA team of an independent study environment. Concerns \nabout the difficulty of retaining trained staff have also been raised. To minimize the risks, the \nGovernment strongly committed to requiring that (i) the staff trained under the TA will be given \nhigh priority to be retained under the new policy development department; and (ii) the Cabinet will  \ndiscuss the recommended improvements in the RDC, including the need to strengthen or amend \nit to make policy implementation more effective. \n \n \n \n ", "  5 \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $710,000 equivalent, of which $338,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $372,000 equivalent in local cost. ADB will finance the entire foreign \nexchange cost and $262,000 equivalent of the local currency cost, totaling $600,000 equivalent, \non  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The  Government  will  fund  the  remaining \n$110,000  equivalent  for  office  accommodation,  utilities, local communications, administrative \nsupport, and counterpart staff. A schedule of the cost estimates and the financing plan is in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The MOFE will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will coordinate with other central \nand line ministries. A TA management unit, involving working group staffs assigned from relevant \nline ministries, will be established under the Department of Economic Policy and Planning, \nMOFE. The TA management unit will serve as the secretariat of the steering committee. The \nMOFE vice minister will chair the steering committee and the Ministry of Infrastructure vice \nminister will be the deputy chair. The TA will require 83.5 person-months of consulting services \n(13.5 person-months of international experts in the fields of regional economic development and \npolicy and legal and institutional analysis, and 70 person-months of domestic consultants). The \nconsultants will be recruited by ADB through a firm, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements for the hiring of domestic consultants. A simplified \ntechnical proposal method will be used. The TA will be implemented in three distinct phases, \nduring which planning and institutional capacity building activities will run in parallel: (i) phase 1\u2014\nassessment and preparation of training modules, (ii) phase 2\u2014training;  and  (iii)  phase  3\u2014\npreparation of the medium-term integrated regional development strategy. Government officials to \nbe  trained  overseas  will  be  selected  based  on  criteria  acceptable  to  ADB.  Component  D, \ndissemination of results and lessons learned through a participatory workshop approach, will run \nthrough all three phases. Four workshops will be held together with the committee meetings to \nencourage  participation  in  planning  and  to  present  the  major  outcomes,  findings,  and \nrecommendations for each phase. The TA will be implemented over 12 calendar months, from \nJanuary to December 2003, with intermittent services of international consultants. \n \n18.  ADB funds will be disbursed to the consultants, who will receive cash advances from ADB \nperiodically by submitting proposed activities and estimated expenditures. The consultants will \nregularly provide ADB with the liquidation statement of expenditures together with supporting \ndocumentation, such as invoices, receipts, or other supporting documents acceptable to ADB to \nsubstantiate the expenditures. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated  by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Mongolia for Capacity Building for Integrated Regional Development Planning, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.

", "8 Appendix 3 \nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES \n \nA.   Overall Arrangements \n \n1.  As the substantive nature of the technical assistance (TA) requires coordination with other \nline ministries and responsibilities to integrate all sector-specific plans into a unified social and \neconomic development plan, the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE) will be the Executing \nAgency for the TA. It will coordinate with other central and line ministries. A TA management unit \n(TAMU) will be established under the Department of Economic Policy and Planning, MOFE, and \nserve as the secretariat of the steering committee. The TA manager will be the director of the \nDepartment of Economic Policy and Planning, and deputy manager will be the Director of \nConstruction, Urban Development and Policy Regulation Department, Ministry of Infrastructure. \nMOFE  will  provide  full-time  counterpart  staff  (with  adequate  English  skills  and  relevant \nbackground) for the international adviser, and other counterpart staff on a part-time basis for each \ndomestic  consultant.  To  facilitate  sustainable  capacity  building,  technical  counterpart  staff, \nsourced from MOFE and other relevant government agencies, will form a working group under \nthe TAMU to work together with the consultants.  \n \n2.  The TA will require 83.5 person-months of consulting services (13.5 person-months of \ninternational and 70 person-months of domestic consultants). International consultants will work \nas policy advisers, providing technical guidance and direction to domestic consultants. The senior \nlevel policy adviser and institutional analyst will be selected and engaged by ADB through a \nconsulting firm based on the simplified technical proposal method, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Use of Consultants and other arrangements for the selection and engagement of \ndomestic consultants. The TA team manager will be from the domestic consultants engaged with \nthe international consulting firm. Other domestic consultants will be selected and engaged at the \ninception stage according to procedures acceptable to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), by \nreviewing their qualifications, technical competence, exposure to overseas training in a market-\nbased economy, and experience relevant to policy analysis. The domestic consultant members \nwill be recruited from qualified academicians, staff of nongovernment organizations and research \ninstitutions by open competition. Qualified technocrats in government agencies (excluding MOFE) \nmay be assigned to participate in the consultant team, subject to their acceptance through open \ncompetition, confirmation from their respective ministers that they are on leave without pay, and \nthe absence of any conflict of interest. Qualified candidates will be interviewed and selected by \nthe consultant team in consultation with the TAMU.  \n \n3.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  12  calendar  months  with  intermittent  services  of \ninternational  consultants,  from  January  to  December  2003.  The  consultants  will  submit  an \ninception report within 1 month of the commencement of the TA. The inception report will \nelaborate work plans and present the draft reports for each component to ADB (in English) and to \nthe Government (in Mongolian). After receiving the steering committee\u2019s guidance and comments \nfrom a tripartite review meeting, a revised final version will be submitted to ADB and international \nagencies (in English) and to the Government (in Mongolian). The TA will be implemented in three \ndistinct phases, with two types of activities undertaken in parallel: planning and institutional \ncapacity building activities. The first component will be assessment and preparation of training \nmodules;  the  second,  the  actual  training  period;  and  the  third,  preparing  the  medium-term \nintegrated  regional  development  strategy.  Additionally,  four  workshops  will  be  conducted  in \nconnection with the committee meetings to encourage participatory development of planning; \ndisseminate  results,  outcomes,  and  lessons  learned  during  the  TA;  and  present  the  major \noutcomes, findings and recommendations of each component.   ", "  Appendix 3  9  \n \n4.  Once training modules have been detailed at the inception stage, the consultants will \narrange an overseas training program, where the climatic and demographic conditions are similar \nto those of Mongolia.
