The Statistics and Data Innovation Unit (SDI) of the Office of the Chief Economist and \nDirector General (EROD) in the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department \n(ERCD) has conceptualized this knowledge and support technical assistance (KSTA) to enhance \nthe capacity of the national statistical systems (NSSs) of select developing member countries \n(DMCs) in Asia and the Pacific to produce high-quality statistical information. The KSTA is aligned \nwith the Strategy 20301 framework of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), wherein ADB and the \nDMCs have pledged support for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the related \nFinancing for Development Agenda. The KSTA will help the NSSs of the participating DMCs \nproduce relevant, accurate, and timely economic statistical indicators to measure progress toward \nthe SDGs, particularly SDG 8 (Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, \nfull and productive employment and decent work for all), and SDG 9 (Build resilient infrastructure, \npromote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation). \n \n2.  The KSTA,2 which is part of the approved ERCD workplan, supports Strategy 2030\u2019s sixth \noperational priority to strengthen governance by enhancing DMCs\u2019 capacity to produce the \neconomic  information  necessary  for  rigorous,  evidence-based  policy  making  and  program \nmonitoring. Further, the statistics produced in participating DMCs will enable their governments \nand ADB to track the countries\u2019 progress and sector-specific gainful participation in global and \nregional value chains, in alignment with the  seventh operational priority: fostering regional \ncooperation and integration. Under similar statistical capacity building initiatives3 by the EROD-\nSDI, the ERCD is currently producing global and regional value chain participation indices and \nanalyses, including regional spillover analysis, for more than 20 regional member countries. As a \nresult of this KSTA the number of DMCs is expected to increase by at least 10, including several \nPacific countries, to produce such analyses. \n \n3.  The KSTA will also enable ADB to expand its economic databases by including critical \nstatistics relevant to the poorest and most vulnerable countries in the region. The ERCD is \ncurrently employing these databases to provide an economic impact analysis for the COVID-19 \nActive Response Expenditure Support program. Because of its past and ongoing statistical \ncapacity building work in Thailand and other Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries, \nthe ECRD was readily able to compile the necessary data and provide the analysis required for \nthe COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option.4 The KSTA will enhance ADB\u2019s capacity to produce \nsuch analysis for more DMCs. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  In a highly globalized and increasingly digitalized world, relevant, accurate, timely, cross-\ncutting, and readily accessible and usable statistical information based on both conventional and \ninnovative data is critical to discern and analyze local and global economic issues confounding \nthe DMCs, and to monitor their progress toward the 2030 Development Agenda objectives. The \nuse of modern computing technologies, cutting-edge methods, and innovative data in statistics \ncan significantly improve the quality, accessibility, and usability of critical information needed to \n \n1 https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/435391/strategy-2030-main-document.pdf \n2 The KSTA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 August 2020. \nhttps://www.adb.org/projects/54260-001/main#project-pds \n3 https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/48387/48387-001-tcr-en.pdf \n4 https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/54177/54177-001-rrp-en.pdf \n \n ", "2 \nstudy current and emerging phenomena, formulate policy, and track progress toward the SDGs, \nwhich ADB recommends to guide the recovery from the coronavirus disease pandemic.5 \n \n5.  While the NSSs in the target DMCs6 produce several principal economic indicators, such \nas gross domestic product (GDP) and GDP growth rates, and even compile some data relevant \nto the SDGs based on partial and incomplete information, they have been unable to develop much \nof the standard statistical framework for national economic information known as the system of \nnational Accounts (SNA). This is critical, not only to produce an accurate estimation of these \neconomic indicators, but also for an in-depth study of the economy. Further, these DMCs continue \nto compile statistics using very limited and even outdated data sources, adversely affecting the \nquality (relevance, accuracy, and timeliness) of the statistics. The NSSs have yet to implement \nmany internationally mandated recommendations on statistical standards, definitions, concepts, \nand frameworks. Further, traditional data release and dissemination methods severely limit data \naccessibility and usability. Such shortcomings seriously hamper the NSSs\u2019 ability to provide \ncritical and timely data to illuminate important economic issues.  \n \n6.  The KSTA will focus on (i) utilizing all available and accessible survey, administrative, and \ninnovative data; and (ii) employing advanced statistical and econometric methods to produce the \nprincipal components of an SNA for participating DMCs as per international standards. The NSSs \nwill also be adequately capacitated to use cutting-edge technical and technological approaches \nto improve the relevance, accuracy, timeliness, accessibility, and costs associated with producing \nkey economic and SDG-relevant statistics based on the SNA. Given this overarching objective, \nstatistical capacity building will be provided across four specific domains: (i) enhancement of \nnational economic accounts, (ii) establishment of statistical business registers (SBRs), (iii) use of \ninnovative data on economic flows for statistical compilation, and (iv) sharing and dissemination \nof knowledge on economic statistics. \n \n7.  By building participating DMCs\u2019 capacity in the domains outlined in para. 6, the KSTA will \nhelp modernize their NSSs by institutionalizing the use of multi-sourced data, applying advanced \nmethods, and adhering to international standards in compiling economic statistics. This will enable \nthe NSSs to meet the increasing data requirements in a global economic environment constantly \nbeing redefined by technological, natural, and socioeconomic phenomena. Further, by integrating \ninternational standards and modern means of compiling statistics in the NSSs, the KSTA will \nfacilitate comparative studies across space and time. By aiming to track intraregional trade \ncomprehensively, empirically assess the effects of various trade facilitation arrangements, and \nstudy the evolution of service sectors (especially tourism) and the digital economy through the \nSNA framework, the KSTA is also well aligned with ADB\u2019s regional strategies related to the \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program and Pacific Islands Forum.7  \n \n8.  In selecting DMCs, ADB will prioritize lower income countries, fragile and conflict-affected \nsituations, and small island developing states. \n \n \n5  https://www.adb.org/news/use-sdgs-and-paris-agreement-guide-recovery-covid-19-adb-vp \n6  ADB will invite the following DMCs to participate in the KSTA: Afghanistan, the Cook Islands, the Federated States \nof Micronesia, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, \nTuvalu, and Vanuatu. \n7  https://www.adb.org/documents/pacific-regional-operations-business-plan-2020-2022,  \n  https://www.forumsec.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pacific-Aid-for-Trade-Strategy-2020-2025.pdf, \nhttps://www.carecprogram.org/uploads/2017-CAREC-2030.pdf  \n ", "3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The intended impact of the KSTA is the advancement of NSSs through statistical capacity \nbuilding initiatives to measure achievement of SDGs and ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 effectively and \ndevelop new datasets swiftly to respond to the ever-evolving globalized economic environment. \nIts outcome is that the NSSs produce highly relevant, accurate, timely, and detailed statistics on \nselected economic domains with a high level of contributions from female professionals in \nparticipating DMCs. The KSTA will support the development of economic data systems and \nknowledge solutions to facilitate policy analysis, formulation, and monitoring. It will employ multi-\nsourced data,  advanced  statistical  methods,  and modern  training  to  strengthen the  NSSs\u2019 \ncapacity  in  four  specific  areas:  national  economic  accounts,  SBRs,  data  innovation,  and \nknowledge sharing and dissemination to provide timely and high-quality statistics to illuminate \npolicy and produce reliable indicators to monitor progress on SDGs. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Detailed supply-use tables and input\u2013output tables of the system of \nnational accounts produced annually by the developing member countries. The KSTA will \nhelp the NSSs of participating DMCs produce a high-quality SNA and annual economic statistics \nderived therefrom that adhere to internationally mandated standards in concepts, definitions, \nclassifications, sources, and methods. As part of this initiative, the NSSs will develop current and \nconstant price supply-use tables, and input\u2013output tables (IOTs). The IOTs will be integrated into \nADB\u2019s Multi-Regional Input\u2013Output Table Database; local, regional, and global value chain \nparticipation  indicators  and  analyses;  regional  cooperation  and  integration  indicators  and \nanalyses; and local, regional, and global economic impact analyses (of the type described in para. \n3) produced for the participating DMCs. \n \n11.  Output  2:  Functional  statistical  business  registers  established  in  developing \nmember countries. Using the SBR database software suite developed by ADB as part of ERCD \ntechnical assistance (TA) R-CDTA-8594,8 all participating DMCs will establish viable SBRs. SBRs \nare statistical databases used to collect, clean, process, structure, synthesize, analyze, and \nmanage various types of information related to business entities gathered from varied sources \nsuch as administrative records, surveys, and innovative data. Depending on the principal data \nsources used, the SBRs can be updated monthly, quarterly, and/or annually. A viable SBR can \nalso provide high-frequency data necessary for nowcasting key economic indicators such as GDP \nand employment. Relevant officials  in participating DMCs will be sufficiently trained in the \noperation and maintenance of SBRs and the integration, management, and analysis of multi-\nsourced business data within the framework of an SBR to produce the information required to \ndevelop and sustain an effective economic statistical system. \n \n12.  Output 3: Developing member countries utilize big data for statistical compilation. \nThe KSTA will demonstrate the feasibility of using big data on trade or related economic flows to \nbridge certain critical data gaps in the SNA and produce certain key economic statistics. The \nNSSs\u2019 primary reliance on conventional data sources largely renders their information outdated, \nespecially during rapidly changing economic circumstances brought about by phenomena such \nas the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the 2008 global financial crisis, and the coronavirus disease \n \n8 https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/47108/47108-001-tcr-en.pdf \n \n ", "4 \npandemic. Relevant big data sources will be analyzed and employed to produce high-quality and \nhigh-frequency key economic statistics for the participating DMCs to discern and monitor rapidly \nevolving trade patterns and supply chains and facilitate policymaking.  \n \n13.  Output  4:  Knowledge  sharing  and  dissemination  by  the  developing  member \ncountries supported. The KSTA will enable selected officials, researchers, and academics from \nparticipating  DMCs  and ADB  staff  to  participate  in  international and  regional  conferences, \nseminars, and workshops on specific subject areas of  the SNA, to enhance technical and \ntechnological capacities, and promote knowledge sharing on topical issues in official statistics. \nParticipants will be required to write a paper on a topical statistical issue related to the SNA of \ntheir DMC. ADB will help the NSSs of participating DMCs develop online economic information \ndissemination  facilities  such  as  readily  accessible  and  easily  navigable  websites  built  to \ninternational standards; and upload data in files and formats that can be processed easily by \nvarious standard analytical software. This will also enable ADB to access economic data of the \nparticipating DMCs directly for the purposes of its flagship publications, such as Key Indicators \nfor Asia and the Pacific, Asian Development Outlook, and the Asian Economic Integration Report. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-VI and TASF-other sources). The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB through the EROD-SDI will be the executing agency for this TA. The EROD-SDI will \nwork closely with all relevant departments, such as the Department of Communications (DOC), \nInformation  Technology  Department  (ITD),  Sustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change \nDepartment, Strategy and Policy Department, and the regional departments. Specifically, the \nproject team will consult the ITD regarding procurement of equipment, software, and other \ninformation technology-related needs of the TA. The DOC will be requested to provide inputs for \nthe publication of knowledge products. The EROD-SDI will also explore potential areas for \ncollaboration with the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department. As a focal point \nof the SDGs, the Strategy and Policy Department will be regularly updated on the TA activities to \nensure synergy between other ADB departments\u2019 existing SDG-related initiatives and those of \nother regional and international agencies. \n \n16.
