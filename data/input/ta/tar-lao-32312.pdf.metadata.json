During the 2003 Country Programming Mission, the  Government of  the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) to \nprepare the Basic Education Development Project. ADB included a loan of $15 million for the \nProject in 2006 in its Country Strategy and Program Update (2004\u20132006). The TA Fact-Finding \nMission from 13 to 22 September 2004 reached an understanding with the Government on the \nobjectives, scope, implementation arrangements, cost estimates, financing arrangements, and \nconsultants\u2019 terms of reference for the TA.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Government\u2019s efforts to establish equitable education, first at the primary and then \nat the lower secondary level, has resulted in the net enrollment rate (NER) of primary schools \nincreasing from 63% in 1989/90 to 83% in 2004/05 and  the gross enrollment rate (GER) of \nlower secondary schools increasing from 30% in 1989/90 to 56% in 2004/05.2 Student numbers \nare increasing rapidly, by some 10,000 annually at the primary level and by some 10% annually \nat the secondary level. ADB has supported the Government\u2019s efforts since 1991. In 2000, the \nGovernment formulated  an Education Strategic Vision  up to 2020, which incorporated the \nMillennium Development Goals and aimed to achieve universal primary education by 2015, \ntogether with a continued expansion in participation at lower secondary level.3 To achieve these \ngoals, the Government increased education\u2019s share of the national budget from less than 8% in \n1997/98 to about 11% in 2003/04, and made education one of four priority areas in its National \nGrowth and Poverty Eradication Strategy, published in 2004. The Ministry of Education (MOE) \nhas also strengthened aid management and coordination by setting up a development partners\u2019 \nmeeting and preparing for a sector-wide approach since 2002. In 2000, the Government issued \na prime ministerial decree on decentralization, applicable to all socioeconomic sectors, including \neducation, seeking improved efficiency and effectiveness in public sector operations.  \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s assistance started in 1991 with the first Education Quality Improvement Project,4 \nfollowed by  the Basic Education (Girls) Project in 2000.5 Based on a comprehensive sector \nstudy in 1998 that provided a policy and investment framework for the period 2001\u20132005,6 ADB \nprovided a loan for the Second Education Quality Improvement Project in 2001,7 which focused \non expanding access to primary education. It also provided a loan in 1995 to revive the higher \neducation system to produce skilled  people to lead national development in various sectors, \nincluding  education,  through  the  establishment  of  the  National  University  of  Laos.8  Other \ninternational  and  bilateral  agencies  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  have  also \nsupported the expansion of primary education,  including the World Bank through its first and \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 27 February 2004.  \n2   Formal education consists of preschool, primary (5 years), lower secondary (3 years), upper secondary (3 years), \nand tertiary (2\u20137 years). Enrollment rates are MOE\u2019s estimate. \n3   Ministry of Education, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. 2000. The Education Strategic Vision up to the Year \n2020. Vientiane. \n4   ADB. 2000.

The report assessed the project as highly successful. \n ", "2  \nsecond Education Development Project in 1993 and 2004, the Government of Japan through \ngrant assistance for teacher training and primary school construction since 1998, and the United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) for a teacher upgrading program since 1996. United Nations \nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has recently drafted the National \nEducation for All (EFA) Action Plan 2003-2015,9 which  is expected to provide a common \nframework for future assistance once it is adopted by the Government. \n \n4.  While progress in basic education was made during the 1990s with external assistance, \neducation service delivery is still uneven and the quality of education has not kept pace with the \nphysical expansion of the system. At the primary level, the NER varies from almost 100% in \nVientiane  City,  to  a  little  more  than  50%  in  northern  and  southern  provinces, indicating \ninsufficient access to primary education in rural areas. Even recently, it required an average of 8 \nyears to produce a primary school graduate.10 About half of students in primary school repeat \ngrades 1 and 2, resulting in poor internal efficiency. At the secondary level, the NER and GER \ndifferentials are more pronounced. The lower secondary level NER in rural areas is much less \nthan half of the NER in  urban areas. A  significant difference in NER  can be  also observed \nbetween the lowest and highest socioeconomic groups.11 The major issues therefore are access \nto basic education by the rural population12 and quality improvement.  \n \n5.  In mountainous areas containing poor rural villages, with ethnically and linguistically \ndiverse populations, including 49 ethnic groups, it is very difficult to  deliver basic education \nservices to  all.  For primary education, despite many ongoing projects, in more than 10,000 \nvillages nationwide MOE predicts that many villages still remains without a primary school, or at \nbest will have an incomplete school that offers only up to the second or third grade. This will \nresult in very few children continuing their education and means that the provision of access to a \ncomplete primary school within a commutable distance will remain an urgent issue. However, \nlow population densities mean that it will be difficult to provide cost-effective education services \nin remote areas.  School-related expenses (including fees), and the need to  involve all the \nfamily members in securing basic necessities, discourage enrollment or continued schooling. \nCreating affordable school access for demand and supply sides and involving local community \nin operation and facility maintenance will be the key.  \n \n6.  Provisions for teaching and learning materials, basic furniture such as a blackboards, \nand trained teachers  have  not  caught  up with the physical expansion of basic  education \nservices, which is one of the main reasons for the inefficiency, i.e., high dropout and repetition \nrates. Although the Lao language should be the medium of instruction, to help students from \nethnic minority groups, MOE  acknowledges the importance of  having teachers from ethnic \nminority  groups  and  providing  supplementary  materials  for  teaching  and  learning  in  other \nlanguages. In Phongsaly Province, for example, less than 10% of the population speaks Lao at \nhome. Considering that the high GER in primary schools includes late enrollment, with many \nstudents already at productive age, incorporation of life skills into school curricula should be \nconsidered in order to motivate older students. Innovative and flexible approaches are needed \nto address demand side issues related to access and relevance. Similar issues can be seen in \nlower secondary education, which is also experiencing a rapid increase in enrollment. However, \nthe approach may need to be different including the expansion of school buildings, separate \nboarding arrangements for boys and girls, and a flexible curriculum, which takes account of the \n                                                 \n9   UNESCO. 2004.

Outreach services targeting female dropouts should \nalso be considered, since very few girls return to class, especially in lower secondary schools.  \n \n7.  The  management  system  must  be  capable  of  delivering  or  supporting  the  future \nexpansion of basic education services nationwide in a cost-effective way. Within the framework \nof the prime ministerial decree, MOE has been decentralizing education management in order \nto improve the relevance and efficiency of service delivery. The province is perceived as the \nstrategic unit, the district as  the planning and budgeting unit, and the village as  the basic \nimplementation unit. The role of the Government will be to supervise and control financial as \nwell as physical process under the decentralization. ADB has recently provided TA to prepare a \nset of operational policies, including preliminary assessments of resources and staff training \nrequired,  particularly  at  the  provincial  and  district  levels.  Continued  assistance  for  the \ndecentralization process will be provided by the proposed project.  \n \n8.  Issues that need to be addressed through policy dialogue during the TA implementation \nand project appraisal include  (i) the control system under  a decentralized system, and (ii)  a \nteacher development and administration framework for basic education. Since the deep cuts in \nthe education budget in 1997 that reduced education\u2019s share of the national budget from about \n15% to below 8%, recovery  has been slow. Although the Government indicates the annual \nbudget guidelines, the final decisions rest with individual provincial governors, whose authority \nis equivalent to that of ministers. Once they have received the total amount for their provinces, \ngovernors may allocate the budget for what they perceive to be the most urgent needs. There is \noften little national coordination because central agencies lack appropriate systems to monitor \nand control budgeting and disbursement at  the provincial level. Decentralization needs  to \nacknowledge  that  resources  need  to  be  allocated  according  to  national  as  well  as  local \npriorities.  \n \n9.  The total supply of teachers needs to be  examined.  Most teachers prefer to stay in \nurban areas, despite the 15\u201325% premiums for teachers assigned to rural areas. There may be \nseveral  reasons  for  this,  including  lack  of  career  opportunities,  poor  communications  and \ncultural barriers in remote villages, and unclear terms of service. Under the rapid expansion of \nthe basic education system, teacher training was carried out on an ad hoc basis by individual \nprojects without a clear teacher development and administration framework. This issue needs to \nbe addressed  in a context of decentralized education management and the relevant policy \nframework, which is being developed under the Second Education Quality Improvement Project. \n \n10.  In summary, urgent issues are (i) improving access to basic education through  the \nconstruction of schools with supply of capable teachers in disadvantaged areas; (ii) enhancing \nthe quality of basic education through  the provision of curricula, instructional materials, and \ntrained  teachers;  and  (iii)  decentralizing  education  management  and  establishing  teacher \ndevelopment and  administration framework within a context of the Lao  People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic\u2019s National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy and the Education Strategic Vision \nUp To 2020. The proposed intervention fits within ADB\u2019s country and sector strategies, both of \nwhich support the Millennium Development Goals.   \n \n    III.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The TA aims to help the Government to prepare the Project so it can start in 2006. The \nProject will be built on three pillars: equitable access, quality and relevance, and management. \n ", "4  \nIt will focus on strengthening basic education service delivery in disadvantaged areas through \nprovisions of facilities and human resources, and institutional development. Specifically, it will \nstrengthen  primary  and  lower  secondary  education  service  delivery  by  (i)  expanding  or \nimproving  school  facilities  for  improved  access;  (ii)  developing  curricula  and  instructional \nmaterials, and teachers through in-service training; and (iii) implementing operational policies for \ndecentralized  education  management,13  together  with  an  institutional  arrangement  for \ndeveloping and administering teachers. The TA output will be a project proposal and a detailed \nproject implementation plan which will identify sites for new schools and include manuals for \ncommunity-based civil work and procurement (CBCP) for consideration by the Government and \nADB. The CBCP manual will also include school design and costing standards, and fund \ndisbursement procedures. The project proposal will compare design and investment alternatives \non the least-cost and sustainability grounds; and will include a detailed procurement plan and \nproject monitoring indicators with baseline data. The project framework is in Appendix 1. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  Activities will be organized in  three components: (i) identifying investment needs by \nupdating  the  relevant  part  of  the  Education  Sector  Development  Plan  Report  2001\u20132005 \n(ESDP) with reference to the Government\u2019s 5-year plan, the EFA Action Plan, and operational \npolicies for decentralized education management; (ii) preparing design alternatives together with \nassessment papers addressing (a) economic, financial, institutional, social,14 and environmental \ndimensions; and (b) the project implementation capacity of and the financial governance and \nmanagement in the Executing Agency; and (iii) preparing a project proposal. Under the TA, \nclose partnership with other donors (for cofinancing) and NGOs (for contracting) will be explored \nso that the Project will be prepared (i) on what has been achieved by the previous project; (ii) in \nconnection with what is being achieved by on-going projects; and (iii) by incorporating lessons \nand experience in the sector.15 An ESDP update for basic education will be prepared  using \navailable secondary data and references. It will summarize (i) remaining issues, prioritizing \nprimary and lower secondary education in terms of school distribution, curricula, textbooks \n(reprinting and distribution), teacher development and administration, community participation, \neducation management, and other areas based on the achievements in the period 2001\u20132005; \nand (ii) capital investment requirements, together with recurrent cost implications, with reference \nto an education sector expenditure review and forecast16 and assistance policies, plans, and \ncommitments of other donors. The project proposal will follow ADB\u2019s guidelines and will be \nsupported by an evaluation of design alternatives; impact assessments; and plans to address \nissues related to resettlement, gender, ethnic minorities, and other dimensions (Appendix 2). \nBased on the assessment papers and lessons from previous projects, policy dialogue will be \nundertaken to make the Project sustainable and minimize risks. Considering the need for \ncommunity participation in the development and operation of village schools, the Government \nwill prepare and adopt manuals for CBCP during the TA period in consultation with ADB.17 \n                                                 \n13   ADB. 2003.

Bangkok. \n14  Social dimensions include poverty, ethnic minority, and gender issues.  \n15  For example, the Project will coordinate with the United Nations World Food Programme to use the distribution \nnetwork of its school food supply project for distributing textbooks and supplementary materials. Coordination with \nthe World Bank\u2019s Second Education Development Project and UNICEF will be explored for textbook reprinting. \n16  World Bank. 2002.

Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $250,000 equivalent is the local currency cost (Appendix 3). The \nGovernment  has  asked  ADB  to  finance  $600,000  equivalent,  covering  the  entire  foreign \nexchange cost and $100,000 of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance \nthe remaining $150,000 equivalent of local currency cost, mainly through contributions in kind \nfor  office  accommodation,  counterpart  staff,  administrative  and  logistic  support,  and  other \nrelated services. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit \nADB to finance an ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  MOE will be the Executing Agency. A steering committee chaired by the vice minister of \neducation  comprising  related  departments  in  MOE  and  representatives  from  the  Prime \nMinister\u2019s Office, the Committee for Planning and Investment, and the ministries of finance and \nforeign affairs will review and provide feedback on major reports produced by the TA, and \nensure that the Project is consistent with Government policies and priorities. MOE will appoint a \ntask force of about 10 counterpart staff to help the steering committee and the TA consultants \nand to prepare the project implementation plan. The TA will be implemented from April 2005 to \nMarch 2006. Each component will be completed in 3\u20134 months. At the end of each component, \na national workshop and a tripartite meeting will be held and the following milestone reports will \nbe submitted to ADB: an inception report, an ESDP update, a project design and assessment \nreports, and a project proposal with a detailed implementation plan. Donors and NGOs will be \ninvited to the national workshops.  \n \n15.  A  team  of  six  international  (17.5  person-months)  and  four  domestic  (25.0  person-\nmonths) consultants will be engaged through a firm by quality- and cost-based selection and a \nsimplified technical proposal procedure, in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \nThe international consultants will be specialists in (i) education management, evaluation, and \nmonitoring (team leader, 10.0 person-months); (ii) basic education for curriculum and textbook \ndevelopment and distribution (1 person-month); (iii) economics  (public expenditure review in \neducation)  (3  person-months);  (iv)  financial  management  and  project  costing  (1.5  person-\nmonths); and (v) procurement (2 person-months). The domestic consultants will have expertise \nin (i) project management and costing (deputy team leader, 10 person-months), (ii) procurement \nand civil works (6 person-months), (iii) social dimensions (6 person-months), and (iv) school \nbuilding  design  and  costing  (3  person-months).  The  outline  terms  of  reference,  including \nreporting requirements, are in Appendix 4. The consultants will carry out all procurement \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Equipment procured under the TA will be turned \nover to MOE upon TA completion.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for preparing the Basic Education \nDevelopment Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "  6  Appendix 1 \nPRELIMINARY PROJECT FRAMEWORK  \n \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary   Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n   \nGoal       \n       \n\u2022 Basic education services  \u2022 By (*), net enrollment rate at  \u2022 Government \nestablished nationwide  primary and lower secondary  statistics \n  schools increased to (**) and (**)   \n     \n\u2022  By (*), gross enrollment rate at  \u2022 ADB statistics \n \nprimary and lower secondary   \nschools increased to  (**) and (**) \n \nPurpose       \n      Assumptions \nBasic education service  \u2022  By (*), (**) students in (**)  \u2022 Semi-annual   \ndelivery in disadvantaged  villages or (**) districts with  loan review  \u2022 Close coordination with the \nareas strengthened in  access to primary and lower  missions  other active donors and \ncoordination with ongoing  secondary school with textbooks    NGOs, particularly with World \nexternal assistance  and teachers  \u2022 Quarterly  Bank regarding its Second \n  progress  Education Development \n\u2022  By (*), geographical net  reports  Project \nenrollment rate and gross     \nenrollment rate disparities  \u2022 Midterm and  \u2022 Community-based civil work \ndecreased to (**) and (**),  final reports  and procurement and NGO \nrespectively    contracting procedures \n    approved by the Government \nprior to the loan effectiveness \n      in harmonization with similar \nsystem introduced by other \ndonors, particularly with a \ncommunity-based contracting \nunder the World Bank Second \nEducation Development \nProject. \n \nRisks \n \n\u2022 Timely policy formulation \n\u2022 MOE has adequate \nimplementation capacity \n\u2022 Timely provision of \ncounterpart fund/contribution \n\u2022 Recurrent expenditure budget \nproperly allocated and \ndisbursed \n \n* = year, ** = figure. \n ADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, LFIS = loan financial information system of ADB, MOE \n= Ministry of Education, NGO = nongovernment organization, TTC = teacher training college, TTS = teacher training school. \nNote: This framework is indicative and noncommittal, and is subject to the result of the TA implementation and project \nappraisal process, which will seek to coordinate activities under the ongoing assistance. \n, \n ", "  Appendix 2  7 \nINITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS  \n \nA.

School-related expenses \n(including fees) and the need to have all family members help in securing basic necessities discourage enrollment and \ncontinued schooling. Nevertheless, there is a strong correlation between poverty and education. The incidence and \nseverity of poverty is greatest among illiterate households. A multivariate analysis of household poverty shows that \nevery extra year of education received by the head of household raised family income by 2%.1 Thus, even though lack \nof education may not be a direct cause of poverty, increasing the level of education is considered a critically important \nfactor for poverty reduction. \n \nImproving access to education for all, enhancing the quality of education and strengthening management of the sector \nare thus priority areas for public investment, as are vocational training and nonformal education.   \n \nThe medium term operation framework of the Lao  People\u2019s Democratic Republic\u2019s National Growth and Poverty \nEradication Strategy, 2004 comprises four main sectors, one of which is education. \n \n \nB.
