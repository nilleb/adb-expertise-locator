THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The  proposed  transaction  technical  assistance  (TA)  facility  will  provide  support  for \nsustainable water management of Dhaka City by focusing on restoration of severely degraded \nwaterbodies in Dhaka watershed through capacity building support to two projects: (i) ongoing \nproject: Dhaka Water Supply Network Improvement Project (DWSNIP),1 and (ii) ensuing project: \nPiloting of Online Continuous Effluent Monitoring System for Surface Water Quality Improvement \nin Dhaka Watershed (for approval in 2021).2  The TA is included in  Bangladesh country \noperations business plan (COBP), 2020\u20132022.3 The TA is aligned with ADB Strategy 2030\u2019s \noperational priorities and will support the delivery of solutions for (i) addressing remaining poverty \nand reducing inequalities, (ii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, \nand  enhancing  environmental  sustainability,  (iii)  making  cities  more  livable,  and  (iv) \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity. \n \n2.  The megacity Dhaka, established on the bank of the Buriganga River about 400 years \nago, had the potential to grow like Venice, for a functional natural drainage system of over 65 \ncanals and lakes crisscrossing the city, and four rivers (i.e. Buriganga, Turag, Balu and Tongi \nKhal) encircling the city.4  Over the past few decades, the lakes and rivers of the city have been \nseverely degraded and the groundwater aquifer has rapidly depleted due to high population \ngrowth (from 0.1 million in 1906 to 20.2 million in 2020) and unplanned urbanization. Water \nmanagement practices have been environmentally unfriendly and unsustainable because of \ndirect discharge of 2 million cubic meters of untreated wastewater from 7,000 industries, 200 \nmillion liters of untreated municipal sewage,5 and improper disposal of 4,000 metric tons of solid \nwaste from the two city corporations every day.6  As a result, surface waterbodies have been \nhighly degraded and filled with solid waste. The natural drainage system has also collapsed due \nto illegal encroachment of 43 of the 65 major drainage canals, rivers, and ponds. \n \n3.  Dhaka City began sourcing public water supply from the Buriganga River since 1874 \nbefore  slowly  transitioning  to  groundwater  to  meet  demand.  With  the  increased  demand, \nShitalakhya River was included to supplement water supply.7 However, as the surface water \nsources around the city become unsafe and untreatable, groundwater has become the prime \nsupply source as the reserve was abundant and of good quality, while the surface water was \ndeteriorating.  \n \n4.  Dhaka  City  extracts  87%  of  its  water  supply  from  groundwater  aquifers.  Increased \ndependency on groundwater has led to a rapid fall of groundwater table by 2-3 meters per year, \nputting the city at the risk of subsidence (footnote 7). The natural process of groundwater \nrecharge is very slow due to increased impervious built-up area and thick impermeable clay \ncover on the Dupi Tila aquifers. Lateral inflow from existing surface waterbodies, such as ponds, \n \n1 ADB. 2016.

Manila: ADB. \n ", "2 \n \ncanals, lakes, and rivers, which are degraded, is an important source for groundwater recharge.8 \nExperts have suggested that to make the Dhaka City healthy, livable, and resilient, it must \nconserve 5,737 acres of water retention area, 18,782 acres of canals and rivers, and 81,000 \nacres of flood-flow zones.9 \n \n5.  Government has taken various initiatives including the policy measures for restoration and \nsustainable management of waterbodies in Dhaka watershed. The four rivers around Dhaka \nCity\u2014Buriganga, Balu, Shitalakhya, and Turag\u2014were declared an Ecologically Critical Area in \n2009 due to high pollution level. The National River Conservation Commission was formed in \n2013  to  recover  the  waterbodies  from  illegal  encroachment.  Revitalization  of  waterbodies \nincluding sustainable management of aquifers was a priority set out in the seventh five-year plan \n(2016\u20132020).10  The forthcoming eighth five-year plan (2021\u20132025) is considering a new priority \non the management of aquifer recharge for artificial storage of water using rainwater harvesting \nto improve the groundwater table.11 The Water Act 2013 promotes rainwater as an important \nsource of safe potable water. However, government has not been able to restore the waterbodies \nand minimize surface water pollution in the city. Implementation of these priority activities \nremains a challenge as detailed studies on the current conditions or the best suitable solutions \nare yet to be explored.  \n \n6.  The ongoing project. The TA facility will support in implementation of the Dhaka Water \nSupply Network Improvement Project. The outcome of the project is sustainable provision of a \nmore reliable, improved, and climate-resilient water supply in Dhaka City. The three outputs are: \n(i) distribution network strengthened, (ii) sustainable managerial capacity of district metered \nareas enhanced, and (iii) capacity for quality delivery service enhanced. Output 1 is being \nachieved by renewing the entire distribution network in the Dhaka City and installation of at least \n50 new production deep tube-wells (DTWs) and regeneration of 200 existing DTWs to ensure \nmore reliable and improved water supply. Output 2 will strengthen the Dhaka Water Supply and \nSewerage Authority\u2019s (DWASA) managerial and technical capacity to keep nonrevenue water at \na low level. Output 3 planned for demand management, water conservation, and preparation and \nimplementation of a water quality monitoring system. The total project amount is $275 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, of which $213.97 million has been disbursed. The project \nwas approved in 2016 and is expected to close in December 2021. DWASA is the implementing \nagency. The risk categorization of the project is \u201ccomplex\u201d in the eOps. Hence, the proposed TA \nwill be classified as \u201ccomplex\u201d. \n \n7.  Dhaka\u2019s dependence on groundwater remains relevant despite the government initiatives \nfor treatment of surface water to meet the demand. According to Water Supply Master Plan, \nDWASA has a zonal approach of water supply by conjunctive use of groundwater and surface \nwater sources, where 30% of supply will be met by groundwater. Among the existing 11 zones \nof  the  city,  eight  zones  have  conjunctive  sources  (footnote  4).  Therefore,  availability  of \ngroundwater in the Upper and Lower Dupi Tila aquifers in the Dhaka watershed needs to be \nstudied well for sustainable management of this resource. This will support the government\u2019s \nplan for conjunctive use of water from both surface and groundwater sources and is aligned with \n \n8  Trotter et al. 2017.

These activities will contribute to the overall Outcome, Output 1, and Output 3 of the ongoing \nproject. \n \n8.  The ensuing project. The TA facility will support the preparation of an ensuing project: \nPiloting of Online Continuous Effluent Monitoring System for Surface Water Quality Improvement \nin  Dhaka  Watershed,  for  approval  in  2021  with  an  expected  outcome  of  restoration  of \nwaterbodies in the Dhaka watershed. 13  The proposed project will be aligned with the priorities \nof the eighth five-year plan (2021\u20132025). The project will implement restoration measures \nincluding water quality monitoring in the pollution hotspots of Dhaka watershed. The project will \nuse innovative technology for online water quality monitoring which will complement output 3 of \nthe Dhaka Water Supply Network Improvement Project (para. 6). As Dhaka\u2019s polluted surface \nwaterbodies, such as ponds, canals, lakes, and rivers are contributing to aquifer recharge, the \nensuing project will further support the achievements of the Dhaka Water Supply Network \nImprovement Project through restoration of existing surface waterbodies in Dhaka watershed.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n9.  The TA facility will deliver following three key outputs: \n \n10.  Output 1. Support hydrogeological study of Upper and Lower Dupi Tila aquifers with \ncomprehensive plan for aquifer recharge. The TA will support the ongoing project through \ncompletion of hydrogeological study to assess the storage capacity of the aquifers, groundwater \nreserves, and recovery status.  The following activities will be conducted: (i) assess the storage \ncapacity of aquifers, threats of pollution from endogenous and exogenous processes, and \nanalyze  groundwater  reserve  and  recovery  status,  and  (ii)  explore  suitable  locations  and \ntechniques for aquifer recharge and (iii) prepare a comprehensive plan for artificial aquifer \nrecharge. As surface waterbodies contribute to aquifer recharge, water quality monitoring and \nrestoration measures supported by ensuing project will directly contribute to the outcome of \nongoing project. The TA will recruit a mix of international and national consultants through a firm \nto deliver the above activities, and they will also help to build the capacity by conducting training \nand raising awareness on demand management, water conservation, and pollution of water \nresources.  \n \n11.  Output 2. Prepare comprehensive water quality monitoring plan for restoration of \nwaterbodies  in  Dhaka  watershed.14 The  TA  will  support  the  ensuing  project  through \npreparation of comprehensive water quality monitoring plan including measures for restoration \nof waterbodies in Dhaka watershed.  The following activities will be conducted: (i) assess supply \naugmentation potentials of available surface waterbodies that are partially or entirely within \nDhaka City by detailed mapping, (ii) prepare a list of waterbodies with restoration potential \nfocusing on all season storage enhancement, groundwater recharge, and enhanced ecosystem \nservices to be supported under the project, (iii) pollution mapping including pollution levels of \n \n12 The study findings will lead to an investment project that will be included in the upcoming country operations business \nplan (COBP), which will lead to sustainable water management, better water quality and environment, and livable \ncities. This is also a priority area for the Government of Bangladesh, and the Government has requested for ADB\u2019s \nassistance in addressing these issues in the Dhaka watershed. \n13 The project for $10 million COL is listed firm for 2021 in the COBP, Bangladesh, 2021\u20132023. \n14 The project will finance innovative technology for online water quality monitoring. \n ", "4 \n \nwaterbodies, quality of receiving influents, and sources for both surface water and groundwater, \n(iv) identify and evaluate suitable restoration measures including technical and nature-based \nsolutions for pollution prevention and reduction, and flow augmentation, and (v) develop a \nmechanism  for  online  water  quality  monitoring.  A  team  of  consultants  will  prepare  a \ncomprehensive plan for water quality monitoring through the activities as above, for both surface \nwater and groundwater to ensure that harmful wastewater is not polluting the groundwater \naquifers. The results will support the preparation of the ensuing project particularly in ensuring \nadherence to ADB\u2019s due diligence15 requirements. \n \n12.  Output 3. Review policies and institutional framework to support restoration of \ndegraded  waterbodies.  Considering  both  surface  water  quality  and  groundwater  supply \naugmentation, the TA will help identify the gaps and suggest policy measures in Dhaka \nwatershed. Artificial aquifer recharge through various measures will be reviewed that can help \nthe  ensuing  project  in  exploring  design  options  to  facilitate  the  restoration  of  surface \nwaterbodies.  A  team  of  international  and  national  consultants  will  deliver  the  output  as \nenvisaged. The policy analysis would bridge the capability gaps, apply best practices, and foster \ninnovative solutions for restoration of waterbodies with a focus on sustainable water supply \nchallenges in the urban water sector which will be utilized in the design of the ensuing project. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n1. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, \noffice supplies, secretarial and coordination assistance, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.
