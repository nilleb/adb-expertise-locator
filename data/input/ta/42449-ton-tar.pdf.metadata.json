INTRODUCTION \n1.  Support by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for economic and strategic management \nin Tonga began in 2002 with the Economic and Public Sector Reform Program (EPSRP),1 which \naimed to help the government address slow economic growth; inequality in income distribution \nand  access  to  services;  and  unemployment  and  poverty.  This  was  followed  by  technical \nassistance (TA) to support the formulation of the Strategic Development Plan 2006/07\u20132008/09 \n(SDP-8),2 and TA for Support for the Implementation of SDP-8.3 During a country contact \nmission in March 2009, the government requested ADB assistance towards the implementation \nof the successor planning document to SDP-8, which ended in June 2009. The government also \nconfirmed that there is limited economic and policy analysis to support decision-making and the \nannual budget process. Specific areas identified for support include macroeconomic analysis \nand forecasting and budget analysis. The key central agencies such as the Ministry of Finance \nand National Planning (MFNP), Public Service Commission (PSC), and the Prime Minister's \nOffice (PMO) also need to strengthen their provision of technical and policy advice, as the \noverall success of policymaking and public financial management depends on each agency \nfulfilling its role. In addition, there is a pressing need to see the central agencies work together \nmore effectively. This requires a closely coordinated and coherent approach to strengthening \neconomic  and  public  financial  management.  The  capacity  development  TA  will  be \ncomplemented by a regional TA supporting economic management in the Pacific in response to \nthe global economic crisis.4  \n \n2.  An ADB fact-finding mission was conducted in June 2009 to reach an understanding \nwith  the  government  on  the  objectives  and  scope,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan, \nimplementation arrangements, and the detailed terms of reference for consulting services of the \ncapacity development TA. The proposed capacity development TA has been included in the TA \nprogram for 2009 in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan 2010\u201320125 and is consistent with \nthe strategic objectives of Responding to the Priorities of the Poor: A Pacific Strategy for the \nAsian Development Bank 2005\u20132009.6 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.7 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  ADB's country partnership strategy 2007\u201320128 for Tonga supported the implementation \nof the SDP-8. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy has three intervention pillars to address \nTonga's  growth  constraints:  (i)  integrated  urban  infrastructure  development,  (ii)  prudent \nmacroeconomic and fiscal management, and (iii) private sector development. The follow-on TA \nfor Support for the Implementation of SDP-8 primarily addressed goal 2 of the SDP-8 to ensure \nmacroeconomic stability through strengthening capacity in the areas of development planning, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

The  SDP-8  ended  in  June  2009  and  Cabinet  endorsed  the  new  national  strategic \nplanning framework (NSPF). The NSPF: (i) takes a longer-term strategic approach to achieving \nsustainable  development  (5\u201310  years),  with  attention  focused  on  the  key  determinants  of \neconomic and social development; and (ii) focuses on a limited number of uniquely national or \ngovernment-wide priorities, with implementation details to be contained in the corporate plans of \nministries and departments. The NSPF identified seven outcomes regarded as fundamental to \nproducing sustained and more equitable economic growth in Tonga. These are (i) community \ndevelopment that meets service needs; (ii) private sector growth (through better engagement \nwith the government, appropriate incentives and streamlining of rules and regulations); (iii) \nconstitutional reform; (iv) improved provision and maintenance of infrastructure; (v) increased \nperformance  of  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training  to  meet  the  challenges of \nmaintaining and developing services and infrastructure; (vi) improved health of the people by \nminimizing the impact of non-communicable diseases; and (vii) environmental sustainability and \nclimate change integrated into all program planning and execution. The three pillars of ADB's \nstrategy for Tonga remain valid in light of the outcome objectives highlighted under the NSPF. \n \n5.  The NSPF is being refined to include performance targets and indicators and will be \noperationalized by ministry and department corporate plans, which are intended to link to the \nbudget process; these will align the NSPF with national priorities, and ministry and department \nobjectives and resource allocations. The NSPF also requires a more robust management and \nmonitoring  mechanism  to  track  the  achievement  of  strategic  objectives,  which  challenges \nministries and departments to focus on the quality of their corporate plans. The Expenditure \nReview Committee (ERC), chaired by the Prime Minister, provides more strategic direction to \nthe government's budget, financial management, and economic policymaking. The capacity of \nministries for planning varies, however, and support is consequently needed to strengthen the \ncapacity of line ministries to support economic management. Activities to finalize the NSPF and \nprepare  corporate  plans  are  now  underway  with  support  from  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development. The proposed capacity development TA will continue this work, and \nwill, in particular, strengthen the link to the overall budget process, as well as the updated \nmedium-term budget framework (MTBF). \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s TA for Support for the Implementation of SDP-8 was designed to support the \nimplementation of SDP-8, but suffered from a number of problems. The TA helped prepare an \nMTBF and provided useful guidance for improvements in public financial management. The \nMTBF lacked strategic direction; however, due to the absence of a clear overarching strategy at \nthe time it was prepared, particularly in terms of medium-term resource allocation. Further work \nis  therefore  required  in  light  of  the  new  NSPF.  The  MTBF  has  helped  MFNP  prioritize \ninvestment projects for possible development partner financing, but further support is required to \nrevise the MTBF and enable it to serve as a useful resource allocation tool. While the focus is \non the MTBF, it is also important to note that the Budget Division of MFNP has experienced \nsignificant recent staff turnover, and much expertise in budgeting has consequently been lost. \nThe  Budget  Division  therefore  requires  capacity  development  in  budget  preparation  and \nanalysis, which should include turning the MTBF into a more strategic tool. The CDTA will \nsupport the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) who will lead the MTBF \nactivities with the Government. \n \n7.  The Economic, Social, Policy and Planning Division of MFNP (known as Policy and \nPlanning) has a diverse role, including provision of economic reports (quarterly and monthly); \n ", "  3\neconomic, debt and sector policy analysis; revenue and GDP forecasting; planning and plan \nmonitoring, reviewing, and reporting; and development of procurement policy among others. \nStrategic planning has been identified as a weak area, partly as one of two positions dedicated \nto this function remains unfilled. The adoption of a much more succinct strategic planning \nframework will place the onus on the ministries and departments to ensure corporate plans (i) \nare aligned with the NSPF, (ii) contain valid and measurable targets and indicators, and (iii) are \nused  as  management  and  performance  assessment  tools.  While  responsibility  for  the \npreparation of corporate plans rests squarely with the ministries and departments concerned, \nPolicy and Planning has an important role in helping ensure that the plans are fully aligned with \nthe  NSPF,  and  that  the  targets  and  indicators  contained  in  them  can  be  measured  and \naggregated, to assist in monitoring and reporting on national strategic plan achievement. The \nPSC has a key coordinating role in the preparation of corporate plans, which it will use as the \nbasis for its performance management system, which is expected to be implemented during \n2009\u20132010. Policy and Planning and the PSC will need to work closely together in helping \nministries and departments prepare their corporate plans.  \n \n8.  Policy and Planning also needs an improved model to assist in GDP and revenue \nforecasting\u2014a common model should be used by the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT), \nStatistics Department and the PMO. A model developed in Samoa with ADB assistance is being \nevaluated with a view to customizing it for use in Tonga. Some assistance is also required in the \nareas  of  more  timely  and  relevant  policy  analysis.  It  is  proposed  that  ADB\u2019s  capacity \ndevelopment  TA  provide  assistance  to  address  the  above  identified  needs  in  Policy  and \nPlanning. \n \n9.  The PMO supports the ERC and is playing an increasing role in policy coordination and \noverall policy direction setting. The greater involvement of the PMO and ERC provides the basis \nfor (i) more strategic management of the budget process; and (ii) clearer strategic guidance to \nministries and departments on policy priorities, making policy choices, and arbitrating between \ndepartments. As NSPF implementation proceeds, the ERC will need to be informed on progress \nrelative  to  performance  targets  in  order  to  (i)  inform  its  decision  making  to  improve \nimplementation; and (ii) where required, establish new priorities and targets. The Australian \nAgency for International Development is supporting the work of the ERC through structural \nreviews of ministries. ADB recently provided funding for the services of an economic and \nstrategy adviser to the Prime Minister, and it is proposed that this support be continued under \nthe capacity development TA.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The intended impact of the capacity development TA is enhanced resource allocation to \nfoster  economic  growth  and  achieve  national  development  priorities.  The  impact  will  be \nmonitored through demonstrated improvements in the country performance assessment ratings \nin macroeconomic management and the quality of budgetary and financial management. The \nexpected TA outcome will be the adoption by the Government of Tonga of improved economic \nand strategic management processes. The achievement of this outcome will be reflected in \nimprovements in public expenditure and financial accountability ratings. \n \n ", "4   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The following outputs are envisaged: (i) regular monitoring and reporting on progress of \nthe NSPF, (ii) use of a GDP and revenue forecasting model, (iii) presentation to decision \nmakers of robust and timely economic policy analysis and proposals, (iv) an MTBF that is \nstrategically aligned and used, and (v) improved policy coordination. \n \n12.  Key activities for output 1 include (i) establishing a monitoring and reporting process for \nthe NSPF, and (ii) capacity development in the monitoring of corporate plan progress and the \nalignment of corporate plans with resource allocations. For output 2, key activities will include (i) \nevaluating and customizing a GDP and revenue-forecasting model; (ii) establishing the model in \nthe  Policy  and  Planning  Division,  the  NRBT,  and  Statistics  Department;  (iii)  developing \nsupporting manuals; and (iv) conducting relevant training and capacity building. For output 3, \nactivities will include (i) research on topical issues, in particular domestic and global trends and \ndevelopments that are likely to impact on the Tongan economy; and (ii) preparation of relevant \nand timely policy papers to advise on the formulation of appropriate policy responses to mitigate \nthe impacts of domestic and external shocks. For output 4, the activities include (i) developing a \nstrategically aligned MTBF, and (ii) establishing a process for updating and using the MTBF. For \noutput 5, the activities include (i) providing advice to the Prime Minister, (ii) providing support to \nERC, and (iii) liaising between the ERC and ministries and departments. \n \n13.  As part of its constitutional reforms, Tonga expects to hold its first democratic elections \nat the end of 2010. A potential risk is that a new government, with limited parliamentary and \nministerial experience, may emphasize different development priorities, raising uncertainties \nwith respect to project implementation. One mitigating factor is the strengthening of the role of \nthe chief executive officers and senior management officials in providing relevant advice to \nincoming  political  leaders,  and  having  the  capacity  to  ensure  implementation  continuity. \nCorporate planning activities undertaken to implement the NSPF will strengthen the capacity of \nchief executive officers, and will be complemented by ongoing public service reforms. ADB \nshould continue to engage a wide range of key stakeholders in programming discussions and \nproject and TA processing to ensure that a minimum level of awareness is maintained, and \nallow for continued support during post-election implementation. \n \n14.  There is a need for continuing coordination\u2014through regular dialogue and information \nsharing\u2014with other key development partners regarding economic and public sector reforms \n(Supplementary Appendix A), and with ADB's regional TA for Pacific Economic Management \n(footnote 4). ADB recently established a joint country focal office with the World Bank Group in \nTonga,  and  a  Tongan  national  has  been  selected  as  the  country  focal  officer.  This  will \nstrengthen collaboration between ADB and the World Bank, and also provide an on-the-ground \npresence  for  both  institutions  for  ease  of  coordination  with  the  government  and  other \ndevelopment partners. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the capacity development TA is estimated at the equivalent of $625,000, \nof which $500,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, \nfunded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the equivalent of $125,000 \nin-kind  through  the  provision  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  and  local \ncommunication. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  MFNP will be the executing agency for the capacity development TA and will ensure that \nTA activities are closely coordinated with the implementing agencies\u2014e.g., the Budget and \nPolicy  and  Planning  divisions,  PMO  (for  forecasting  and  policy  coordination),  NRBT  (for \neconomic analysis, management and forecasting), Statistics Department (for forecasting), and \nline ministries (for corporate planning)\u2014as well as other key stakeholders. The ERC will be the \nsteering committee for the capacity development TA, while the recently revived Macroeconomic \nTechnical Committee will oversee the implementation of support from various development \npartners,  and  monitor  progress  by  the  implementing  agencies.  The  Macroeconomic \nCoordinating  Committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  secretary  for  finance  and  includes \nrepresentatives  from  the  key  central  agencies  such  as  the  PMO,  NRBT,  and  Statistics \nDepartment. The Macroeconomic Technical Committee will also act as the conduit between the \nERC (which provides policy direction), the Project and Aid Coordinating Committee (which \nconducts investment project appraisals), and line ministries. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 2 years, from January 2010 to December \n2011.  ADB  will  engage  international,  regional,  and  national  consultants  with  expertise  in \nplanning, economic policy, economic modeling and budget analysis through a firm using the \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  method,  after  seeking  simplified  technical  proposals.  An \nindividual consultant will be selected in addition to a firm.9 The consultants will be engaged \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nThe TA will require about 35 person-months of consulting services comprising about 15 person-\nmonths of international, 8 person-months of international or regional, and 12 person-months of \nregional or national consultant services to carry out the activities as defined in the terms of \nreference (Appendix 3). The experts will be supplemented by ADB's regional TA resources, \nincluding the ADB\u2013World Bank Group country focal officer and experts under ADB\u2019s TA for \nPacific Economic Management, as required. The proceeds of the capacity development TA will \nbe disbursed in line with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.10 \n \n18.  The team leader will produce a concise inception report outlining the work program and \nmilestones for the duration of the capacity development TA, and a final report summarizing the \nachievements, issues, lessons learned, and next steps. Throughout the capacity development \nTA, the team leader will submit (by e-mail) brief monthly progress reports summarizing TA \nactivities, progress, issues, and constraints. Team members will produce inputs (reports) on \ntheir respective activities for the team leader's progress and final reports. The team leader's final \nreport will be submitted in draft form at least 5 weeks prior to the end of the assignment, and the \nfinal report within 2 weeks of receipt of comments by the government and ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Tonga for Support for Economic and Strategic Management, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n9  The services of the economic and strategy adviser to the Prime Minister (para. 9) will be continued under an \nindividual contract. \n10 ADB. 2008.

Public sector finances have improved significantly in the past two years. Earlier in the \ndecade,  substantial  progress  had  been  made  in  reducing  endemic  public  sector  deficits\u2014by \nFY2004, government accounts were in surplus and remained so for FY2005. However, the civil \nservice strike in 2005 and the consequent large increase in public sector wages and salaries had a \nsubstantial negative impact on the fiscal position. Even though there was a large subsequent \ndownsizing  of  the  civil  service,  the  pay  increases  and  the  redundancy  packages  increased \ngovernment expenditure by the equivalent of 15% of GDP in the two years ending June 2007. \nHowever,  the  Government  managed  the  impact  prudently.  Helped  by  a  strong  revenue \nperformance and significant expenditure cuts, deficits were limited to 1.8% of GDP in FY2006 and \nthe budget balance was in surplus in FY2007. The Government further tightened its fiscal stance in \nFY2008 and achieved a more substantial surplus of 2.2% of GDP. The Government needs to build \non its fiscal prudence by improving its economic and strategic management. \n \n2.  The Economic and Public Sector Reform Program (EPRSP) put in place the institutional \nand legislative framework for public financial management, public enterprise management, and \npublic service delivery. However, the program was not fully implemented. Generally, preparation of \nregulations supporting the newly adopted legislation was slow and enforcement remained weak \ndue to resource constraints and lack of political commitment. Importantly, the issue of downsizing \nthe public service was not addressed and nor was an effective performance management system \nlinked to better public service delivery put in place. Macroeconomic performance in 2002\u20132005 fell \nshort of EPRSP targets. Subsequently, a voluntary redundancy program, initiated in the first half of \n2006, downsized the public service, but there was no strategic dimension to this (i.e., prioritization \nof where the cuts should be made).   \n \n3.  The  ADB  TA  to  support  the  implementation  of  SDP-8  provided  useful  guidance  for \nimprovements in public financial management which largely confirmed and built on an earlier public \nexpenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) assessment. Together, these assessments clearly \nidentify the areas for improving public financial management. Progress of this will be monitored \nthrough future PEFA assessments and AusAID has indicated its interest in supporting improved \npublic financial management. ADB is well placed to provide technical backstopping through its \nCountry Focal Officer in Tonga and staff in its Suva office as required. AusAID TA support would \nbe centered on the Treasury Division of MFNP. \n \n4.  Economic policy making in Tonga suffers from weaknesses in the availability and reliability \nof economic data. A recent IMF Article IV mission concluded that improved economic statistics \n(particularly in the areas of national accounts and balance of payments) will enhance policy making. \nRecent work by the Statistics Adviser of the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) \nhas provided recommendations for what needs to be done to remedy this situation. The Statistics \nDepartment needs improved leadership and technical strengthening. AusAID has indicated its \nwillingness to provide assistance to the Statistics Department. It is expected that PFTAC will \nprovide technical backstopping as required. \n \n5.  The NRBT suffers from a severe and persistent lack of technical skills in the areas of \neconomic analysis, monetary policy formulation and banking supervision, particularly of non bank \nfinancial institutions. NRBT has been developing its system for data collection and dissemination \nand undertaking basic analysis of such data over the past few years. There is now a need to \nleverage current dataset and improve analytical ability to be of greater benefit for monetary policy \nformulation, improved economic management and banking supervision. Support is needed through \na relevant technical expert to work within the Research Department to improve economic analysis, \n ", "12  Supplementary Appendix A \n \nmanagement  and  forecasting.  Banking  supervision  and  monetary  policy  would  be  most \nappropriately supported by PFTAC with or without longer term support from another development \npartner. \n \n6.  With support from the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), the Public \nService Commission has started a structural review of departments with work ongoing for three \ndepartments (Ministry of Finance and Planning, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, Forestry and \nFood, and Revenue Services Department). The results will be considered by the Expenditure \nReview Committee (ERC). The decisions made from this exercise will also be reflected in the new \ncorporate plans. In turn, a revised medium term budget framework (MTBF) will flow out of the new \nstrategically aligned ministry and department corporate plans. The corporate plans will provide the \nbasis for PSC to manage the performance of the public sector senior managers. \n \n7.
