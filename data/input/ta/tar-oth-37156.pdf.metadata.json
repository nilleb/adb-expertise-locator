Urban areas in the Mekong region are the locus of forward and backward linkages. \nBackward linkages occur through economic and demographic interactions between urban and \nrural areas while forward linkages take place through the interface, in the urban centers, of \nnational and subregional1 marketing and production channels. The extent to which urban areas \ncan play an effective role in properly integrating rural economy and population with national, \nsubregional,  and  global  markets  and  in  broad-based  distribution  of  globalization  benefits, \ndepends on the nature of rural-urban-subregional linkages to be largely influenced by urban \nstrategies.  With  proper  strategies,  these  linkages  can  leverage  balanced  rural  and  urban \ndevelopment and broad-based national growth. However, the current knowledge of rural-urban-\nsubregional linkages in the Mekong region is inadequate to formulate appropriate strategies. In \nresponse to the issue, a fact-finding mission visited Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic (Lao PDR), and Viet Nam during May 2003. Based on discussions with stakeholders \nand  a  review  of  relevant  policy  and  strategy  documents,  including  the  10-year  Strategic \nFramework for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) program of economic cooperation, the \nmission formulated and reached an understanding with the governments on the objective, \nscope,  cost,  financing  plan,  and  implementation  arrangements  of  the  regional  technical \nassistance (TA)2.  The  TA  is  intended  to  help  fill  the  knowledge  gap  on  rural,  urban,  and \nsubregional linkages and develop effective strategies to promote mutually supportive rural and \nurban development and competitive cities and towns in the process of subregional economic \nintegration in the Mekong region. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Until  recently,  most  development  and  poverty  reduction  efforts  have  been \ncompartmentalized, focusing on either \u201curban\u201d or \u201crural\u201d issues with little consideration of the \ninterrelations between the two. In countries that are at early stages of urbanization and where \npoverty is predominantly a rural phenomenon, the development agenda has been dominated by \nrural concerns whereas in countries with higher levels of urbanization, efforts have been biased \ntowards  urban  interests.  However,  it  is  now  increasingly  recognized  that  rural  and  urban \ndevelopment is interdependent. There are economic and demographic linkages reflected in the \nflows of goods, services, people, labor, capital, and information across the urban and rural \nspace. In an economic sense, rural producers need markets, services, information and capital \nthat are mostly found in the urban areas while demographic linkages (rural-to-urban migration \nand  commuting)  form  a  critical  means  of  access  to  nonfarm  employment  and  livelihood \ndiversification for the rural poor (Appendix 2). These linkages between urban and rural areas \nmean that changes in one affect the other: investments in urban and rural areas are not \nmutually exclusive, but can be mutually supportive, if they are properly planned.  \n \n3.  Some countries in the Mekong region have acknowledged rural and urban development \ninterdependencies. For example, the Lao PDR has made, in its national development plan, a \ncommitment to strengthening rural to urban market linkages to support its rural development \nstrategy. A recent project, in the Lao PDR\u2019s small towns, demonstrated significant potential \nimpact of urban investments on the surrounding poor rural hinterland in terms of (i) expanded \nmarketing, know-how, and agricultural input for rural produce; (ii) improved urban services, \namenities, and commodities that are of vital importance to rural well-being; and (iii) increased \nnonfarm jobs for the rural poor. Viet Nam has also recognized the importance of rural-urban \nlinkages. A principal thrust of Viet Nam\u2019s Central Region Development Strategy (2000) is to \nenhance rural-urban linkages. Moreover, rural-urban linkages are a high priority item on the \n                                                 \n1  Subregion, in this paper, refers to the Greater Mekong Subregion,  which comprises Cambodia, Lao PDR, \nMyanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam, and the Yunnan Province of People\u2019s Republic of China, which are included under \nthe ADB-supported GMS economic cooperation program. Initiated in 1992, the program has been strengthening \neconomic linkages among the countries through infrastructure and nonphysical interventions.    \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 23 April 2003.   ", "2   \nagenda  of  the  Viet  Nam  Urban  Forum,  composed  of  representatives  of  the  government \nagencies and development partners.  \n \n4.  Nevertheless, despite the widespread acceptance of the concept of rural-urban linkages \nin the Mekong region, there still remains inadequate knowledge of the interconnectivities of rural \nand urban development and the particular ways these linkages can be affected positively. In \nsome  Mekong  countries,  such  as  Cambodia,  with  relatively  higher  proportions  of  rural \npopulations, this knowledge gap has led to a tendency to focus development efforts solely within \nrural boundaries. At the urban level, inadequate knowledge of rural-urban linkages has resulted \nin planning and management practices that have been ineffective at exploiting the potential role \nthat urban areas can play in promoting complementarities for rural development and reducing \npoverty within and beyond urban boundaries. These practices have been reflected (i) in some \ncases as the concentration of economic activities, wealth, and population in few larger cities, \nsuch as Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi in Viet Nam, at the expense of extensive rural regions with \nlittle access to essential urban markets and services; and (ii) in other cases, like the in the city of \nPhnom Penh, as initiatives to stop rural-to urban migration by overlooking the basic needs of the \nmigrant populations, with destructive effects on labor markets and the livelihood of the poor. \nInappropriate  urban  strategies  have  also  meant  ill-defined  public  investments  in  wrong \nlocations,  i.e.,  inefficient  use  of  scarce  resources  available  for  development  and  poverty \nreduction.  \n \n5.  Furthermore,  the  prevailing  knowledge  gap  about  rural-urban  linkages  has  been \ncompounded by changing forms of rural and urban relationships under the current phenomenon \nof global and subregional integration in the Mekong region. The linkages have gone beyond the \nnational  boundaries  and  been  further  complicated.  Growing  globalization  of  production \nprocesses,  cross-border  trade,  foreign  investment,  and  labor  mobility  among  the  regions\u2019 \ncountries  have  made  the  regions\u2019  national  economies  increasingly  interdependent.  In  this \nprocess,  the  urban  areas,  as  the  locations  of  massive  markets,  production,  know-how, \ninnovation, and management and financial skills and resources, have emerged as strategic \nplaces. Beside being home-towns and centers for marketing and servicing for their national \nregions, urban areas have become crucial nodes for subregional interaction and servicing of \nfirms, markets, and financial operations.  \n \n6.  At  the  same  time,  the  process  of  integration,  reinforced  by  major  subregional \ninfrastructure and nonphysical interventions under the GMS economic cooperation program, is \nrapidly transforming the urban systems in the region. More importantly, the four GMS flagship \nprograms of north-south, east-west, and southern economic corridors, and Facilitating Cross-\nborder Trade and Investment have significant effects on the urban areas on these corridors and \nborders. For example Danang, on the eastern end of the east-west corridor in Viet Nam, is \nrapidly becoming an important agro-processing and manufacturing center, a business hub of the \nViet Nam central region, and a significant gateway for exports of the GMS to global markets. \nBorder towns, such as Mukdahan in Thailand and Savannakhet in the Lao PDR, are evolving \ninto areas of major interface between the Lao PDR\u2019s natural resources and Thai capital and \nskills. Lao Cai in Viet Nam, a border crossing point between Yunnan Province of the People\u2019s \nRepublic China and Viet Nam on the northern economic corridor, is flourishing with the trade \nsector growing at 40% per year. Towns such as Sisophon and Battambang on the southern \ncorridor in Cambodia are becoming subregional centers as a result of the enhanced linkages of \nproduction and trade being created by the southern corridor.       \n \n7.  Major  implications  of  the  expanded  interconnectedness  and  accompanying \ntransformation are that (i) the growth and welfare of urban centers and their rural hinterlands are \nno longer affected only by internal factors, but are also influenced by forces far beyond national \nborders; (ii) cities and towns are increasingly placed in a competitive framework of subregional \nintercity networks; and (iii) economic corridors create significant opportunities to strengthen the ", "  3 \nrural-urban-subregional linkages in the poorer sections of the Mekong region, and present \nconsiderable  planning  and  management  challenges  for  the  urban  areas  to  meet  the  new \ndemands of the integration process. Understanding of the forces of subregional integration as \nwell as the prominent roles that urban areas are playing and will play in the subregional \nintegration process is vital to devising and implementing appropriate strategies that will unleash \nthe potential of urban areas to exploit the new opportunities for the benefit of the region\u2019s poor.  \n \n8.  If the Mekong region is to grow in a balanced way, there is need for policy-makers and \nplanners (i) to develop a clear understanding and knowledge of interdependencies between \nrural and urban development and the symbiotic relationships and effects between the region\u2019s \nurban areas and the subregional integration process, and (ii) to promote appropriate national \nand local-level urban strategies that can influence rural-urban-subregional linkages to enhance \nthe  urban  support  for  rural  development  and  poverty  reduction  while  maximizing  pro-poor \nbenefits from the subregional integration process.  \n \n9.  Subregional integration is a major element in promoting sustained growth and a better \nlife  for  all  in  the  country  strategies  and  the  poverty  reduction  partnership  agreements  of \nCambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. The TA will complement the GMS economic cooperation \nprogram supported by Asian Development Bank (ADB). The \u201cGMS Strategic Framework, 2002\u201d \nstresses the need to complement the sector approach with mechanisms for enhanced cross-\nsector linkages. The TA will contribute to developing a cross-sectoral approach to development, \nand thus enhance the overall development impact of individual sector interventions in the \nMekong region. It will particularly complement the four GMS flagship programs.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n10.  The long-term goal of the TA is to contribute to poverty reduction and broad-based \ngrowth  in  the  Mekong  region  by  promoting  the  synergies  of  positive  rural,  urban,  and \nsubregional linkages. The objectives are (i) to increase awareness and knowledge of task \nmanagers in the Mekong region on rural-urban-subregional linkages, (ii) to assess the issues \nand opportunities that are arising from rural-urban-subregional interdependencies and that have \nsignificant implications for poverty reduction in the region, and (iii) to determine appropriate \nnational and local urban strategies and potential areas of interventions that will foster mutually \nsupportive  rural-urban  development  and  enable  urban  areas  to  consolidate  gains  from \nsubregional integration for the benefit of the nations\u2019 poor.  \n \n11.  The TA will cover Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. Other GMS countries will be \nstudied as the complementarities, especially of subregion-level analyses, require. The TA will \nresult in a guiding framework that will offer an overview and analysis for understanding and \ninfluencing rural-urban-subregional linkages in the three participating countries. The output will \nalso offer clear strategies to harness the positive urban-rural-subregional linkages for broad-\nbased national development. The TA will improve urban strategy formulation and the project \ndesign that will foster the role of urban areas in support of rural development, broad-based \ngrowth, and national poverty reduction. It will influence the design of future urban projects e.g., \nLao PDR Northern and Central Region Urban Development. Moreover, a greater awareness of \nrural-urban-subregional  linkages  in  the  region  in  general,  and  improved  urban  strategy \nformulation  in  particular,  will  result  in  enhanced  national  planning  and  programming  and \nsubregional  strategy  formulation.  The  TA  will  support  the  Lao  PDR  country  strategy  and \nprogram  and  the  Viet  Nam  central  region  development  strategy,  both  of  which  aim  at \nstrengthening rural-urban linkages and competitiveness of the countries in the subregional \nintegration process. Cambodia will gain from increased understanding of development linkages \nbetween and impacts of subregional integration on urban centers and their rural counterparts. In ", "4   \naddition, the TA is expected to add to the emerging literature on rural-urban linkages in a \nglobalizing world.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented in two partially overlapping phases. In the first phase of the \nTA, an overview of rural, urban, and subregional linkages will be undertaken in each of the \nparticipating countries. The second phase of the TA will be assigned to more specific analyses \nand studies focusing on the selected geographic regions. The selected geographic regions will \nprioritize the GMS economic corridors, and are likely to include border areas and specific \ngeographic areas  that are  prioritized  by  ADB and  the  participating governments  for  future \ndevelopment assistance. The TA will  \n \n(i)  review  and  assess,  in  the  three  participating  countries,  types  and  forms  of \neconomic and demographic linkages between urban and rural areas in relation to \nspecific urbanization patterns and various categories of urban settlements and \nassess the implications of these linkages for both urban and rural development; \n(ii)  assess the impact of prevailing urbanization patterns and national urban systems \non  rural  development  and  poverty  reduction  as  well  as  the  subregional \nintegration process;  \n(iii)  analyze the changing character of urban areas, national urban systems, and \nemerging subregional interurban network produced by increased transnational \ninteractions, especially as a result of the ongoing development of the four GMS \nflagship programs of north-south, east-west, and southern economic corridors \nand facilitating cross-border trade and investment;  \n(iv)  analyze the impact of subregional integration process, including the effects of the \nfour GMS flagship programs on the relationship of urban areas with their national \nregions  and  rural  hinterlands  and  emerging  opportunities  and  challenges  for \nregional development and poverty reduction; \n(v)  assess  the  new  demands  placed  on  the  urban  areas  as  a  result  of  the \nsubregional integration and measures to enhance the competitiveness of urban \nareas while strengthening the positive linkages with the rural hinterland;           \n(vi)  examine  national  and  local-level  urban  and  regional  policies  and  strategies, \ninstitutional  and  governance  frameworks,  as  well  as  sector  policies  such  as \ntrade,  industry,  agriculture,  which  have  a  bearing  on  rural-urban-subregional \ninteractions;  and  assess  the  strength  and  weaknesses  of  these  policies  in \npromoting mutually beneficial urban and rural development and exploiting the \ntransnational opportunities for the benefits of the nations\u2019 poor; and  \n(vii)  determine areas and the nature of urban interventions in policy (spatial, fiscal, \neconomic), regulatory, institutional, and operational (investment strategies) terms \nthat will promote mutually reinforcing urban and rural development and enable \nurban areas to maximize pro-poor benefits from subregional cooperation.  \n \n13.  The TA, to the extent possible, will build on and use existing studies under the GMS \neconomic cooperation program and will coordinate with relevant projects, e.g., the Lao PDR \nNorthern Region Strategic Action Plan and the TA for Markets for the Poor. The TA, through \nworkshops and consultative meetings, will be used as a process of learning on rural-urban-\nsubregional linkages in the Mekong region. These forums will provide challenging empirical \nassessments  and  advice  to  task  managers  who  are  in  charge  of  urban/regional  strategy \nformulation and investment decisions with far-reaching consequences for the quality of life of \nthe urban and rural populations. A subregional workshop is also planned at the end of the TA to \nshare with the country task managers, development partners, and other stakeholders, the TA \noutputs.  \n \n ", "  5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $450,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $400,000, \non a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The participating governments will provide the \nremaining $50,000 equivalent, largely in kind. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  The  TA  focal  agencies  in  each \nparticipating country will oversee and coordinate the TA activities. For Cambodia, the focal \nagency will be the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning, and Construction; for Lao \nPDR, the Department of Housing and Urban Planning under the Ministry of Communication, \nTransport, Posts, and Construction; and for Viet Nam, the National Institute of Rural and Urban \nPlanning under the Ministry of Construction. Each country will form a task force, chaired by the \nTA focal agency, and comprising members of national planning agency, ministries responsible \nfor urban and rural development, GMS coordinating body, urban local governments, and other \nagencies  concerned.  Mechanisms  will  be  established  to  closely  involve  in  the  TA \nrepresentatives of the private sector, nongovernment, and mass organizations.  \n \n16.  The TA will be undertaken by a team of international and domestic consultants to be \nrecruited on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. About \n31 person-months of consulting services will be required, including about 10 person-months of \ninternational  and  21  person-months  of  domestic  specialists.  The  team  will  comprise  an \ninternational specialist and team leader (7 person-months) with expertise on regional and urban \ndevelopment  planning and  an  international  development  economist  (3  person-months)  and \ndomestic  specialists  in  regional  and  urban  planning,  development  economics,  and  public \nadministration and governance. The outline terms of reference for consultants and outline of the \nfinal report are in Appendix 4.    \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over a 13 month period from November 2003 to December \n2004, with intervals for review and consultation. The TA focal agencies in each participating \ncountry will provide office space, facilities, and suitably qualified counterpart staff. Equipment \nrequired under the TA will be procured according to ADB\u2019s guidelines for procurement, and \nturned over to the TA focal agencies upon completion of the TA. An inception report, proposing \na sound research methodology, a framework for analysis of rural-urban-subregional linkages, \nand a work program, will be submitted within 1 month of the TA\u2019s start. An interim report, to be \nsubmitted by the end of the sixth month of the TA, will provide an overview of rural-urban-\nsubregional  development  linkages  in  the  three  participating  countries.  A  draft  final  report, \ncontaining detailed assessments in and the proposed strategies for the specific regions, will be \nsubmitted within 12 months of the TA commencement. A final report will be submitted 1 month \nafter the governments and ADB comment on the draft final report. Tripartite meetings will be \nheld among the participating governments, ADB, and the consultants at key stages of the TA. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis for \nRural,  Urban,  and  Subregional  Linkages  in  the  Mekong  Region:  A  Holistic  Approach  to \nDevelopment and Poverty Reduction, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  6 \nTECHNICAL
