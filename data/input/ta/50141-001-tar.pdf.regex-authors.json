INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested policy and advisory \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  support  the  PRC\u2019s \ninitiative on Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, which are jointly \nreferred to as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The TA is included in the ADB Country \nOperations Business Plan, 2016\u20132018 for the PRC.1 ADB fielded a reconnaissance mission in \nmid-January 2016 and reached an understanding with the government on the impact, outcome, \noutputs,  implementation  arrangements,  costs,  and  terms  of  reference  for  consultants.  The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Regional cooperation and integration (RCI) is a process by which national economies \nbecome  more  interconnected  regionally.  RCI  plays  a  critical  role  in  accelerating  economic \ngrowth, reducing poverty and economic disparity, raising productivity and employment, and \nstrengthening institutions. It narrows development gaps between ADB\u2019s developing member \ncountries by building closer trade integration, intraregional supply chains, and stronger financial \nlinks, enabling slow-moving economies to speed their own expansion. It is an important platform \non which countries work together toward unlocking their vast economic potential, achieving \nsustained rapid growth, and reducing poverty. \n \n3.  The PRC conceptualized the BRI Initiative in 2013. In March 2015, the government \nissued  a  vision  document  that  provides  information  on  the  background,  principles  and \nframework, priority areas, and proposed cooperation mechanisms of BRI.3 The vision document \nstates that BRI aims to achieve better connectivity and economic cooperation among countries \nin Eurasia. The Silk Road Economic Belt focuses on bringing together PRC, Central Asia, \nRussia and Europe (the Baltics); linking PRC with the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean Sea \nthrough Central Asia and West Asia; and connecting PRC with Southeast Asia, South Asia and \nthe Indian Ocean through this initiative, the PRC is interested in supporting the development of \nsix  economic  corridors  in  coordination  with  other  concerned  countries:  (i)  PRC\u2013Mongolia\u2013\nRussian Federation, (ii) new Asia\u2013European Continental Bridge, (iii) PRC\u2013Central Asia\u2013West \nAsia, (iv) PRC\u2013Mainland Southeast Asia, (v) PRC\u2013Pakistan, and (vi) Bangladesh\u2013PRC\u2013India\u2013\nMyanmar. The 21st Century Maritime Silk Road proposes to focus on port construction and \nmultimodal transport and logistics, as well as maritime ecological protection, linking PRC\u2019s \ncoastal regions to Europe through the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean in one route, and \nthrough the South China Sea to the South Pacific in the other. \n \n4.  BRI  is  one  of  the  major  regional  cooperation  initiatives  in  terms  of  its  geographic \ncoverage and expected scale of investment. The international community is keen to understand \nbetter how these strategies may influence and reshape the PRC\u2019s economic relations with its \nneighbors. Currently, different countries and multilateral development partners are promoting \nmany different regional and subregional cooperation initiatives aimed at linking Asia and Europe. \nThese include the Partnership for Quality Infrastructure (Japan), the Eurasia Initiative (Republic \nof  Korea),  Steppe  Road  (Mongolia),  and  New  Silk  Road  (United  States).  Regional  and \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2016\u20132018. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 31 March 2016. \n3  Government of the PRC, National Development and Reform Commission; Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and Ministry \nof Commerce. 2015. Vision and Actions on Jointly Building Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st-Century Maritime \nSilk Road. Beijing. http://www.sdpc.gov.cn/gzdt/201503/t20150330_669392.html \n ", " 2\nsubregional  cooperation  platforms  are  also  being  implemented,  including  the  Asia\u2013Europe \nMeeting,4 Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation, Economic Cooperation Organization,5 \nEurasian  Economic  Union,  6 Greater  Mekong  Subregional  (GMS)  economic  cooperation, \nLancang\u2013Mekong Cooperation,7 and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. It is important that \nBRI build synergy and ensure complementarity with these various initiatives and platforms. \n \n5.  For example, the proposed PRC\u2013Mainland Southeast Asia economic corridor under BRI \ncovers  the  geographic  area  of  the  GMS  program  and  extends  to  Malay  Peninsula  and \nSingapore.  The  need  for  a  coordination  mechanism  with  the  GMS  and  other  subregional \ncooperation mechanisms8 in the area will have to be raised with those participating countries \nthat are also interested in the PRC\u2013Mainland Southeast Asia economic corridor transport route, \nroad map, and implementation plan. The PRC government intends to promote BRI economic \ncorridors by relying on core cities along the transport routes and using economic zones and \nindustrial parks as cooperation platforms. \n \n6  The strategic importance of RCI is anchored in the ADB charter, which views RCI as a \ncritical complement to national development actions to improve welfare.9 ADB defined its roles \nin RCI from four perspectives: (i) as financier, providing or mobilizing financial resources for RCI; \n(ii) as knowledge provider, creating, consolidating, and disseminating knowledge on RCI; (iii) as \ncapacity  builder,  helping  developing  member  countries  and  coordinating  bodies  build  their \ncapacity to manage RCI; and (iv) as honest broker, serving as catalyst and coordinator of RCI in \nthe region. In terms of lending, the Strategy 2020 set a 30% overall lending volume target for \nRCI-related ADB operations by 2020.   \n \n7  The mid-term review (MTR) of Strategy 2020 (i) confirmed the importance of RCI in \nADB's strategic agenda, (ii) reiterated the 30% operational target, and (iii) highlighted the need \nto  adapt  the  implementation  of  ADB's  RCI  Strategy10 towards  improving  productivity  and \ncompetitiveness and better mitigation of vulnerabilities. Asia and the Pacific\u2019s architecture for \n                                                \n4 The Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) is an informal process of dialogue and cooperation bringing together the 28 \nEuropean Union member states, 2 other European countries, and the European Union with 21 Asian countries and \nthe ASEAN Secretariat. The ASEM dialogue addresses political, economic and cultural issues, with the objective of \nstrengthening the relationship between our two regions, in a spirit of mutual respect and equal partnership. It was \nofficially established on 1 March 1996 at the first summit in Bangkok, Thailand. The initial ASEM partnership in \n1996 consisted of 15 EU member states and 7 ASEAN member states plus China, Japan, Korea and the European \nCommission. It was officially established on 1 March 1996 at the first summit in Bangkok, Thailand. ASEM currently \nhas 53 partners: 51 countries and 2 regional organizations (European Union and ASEAN Secretariat). \n5  The Economic Cooperation Organization is an intergovernmental regional organization established in 1985 by Iran, \nPakistan, and Turkey for the purpose of promoting economic, technical, and culture cooperation among member \ncounties.   http://www.ecosecretariat.org/detail_info/about_eco_d.htm \n6  The Eurasian Economic Union is an economic union evolved from Eurasian Economic Community.  Its member \ncountries include Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia.   \n7  The Lancang-Mekong Cooperation framework was officially launched on November 2015 by the PRC, Thailand, \nCambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet Nam.  At the early stage, member countries will \ncooperate in three key areas:  politico-security issues, economic affairs and sustainable development, social affairs \nand people-to-people exchanges. \n8  There are 12 regional groupings within the Mekong subregion, which is participated by at least one GMS member. \n9  Article 2(ii) of the Charter mandates ADB \u201cto utilize the resources at its disposal for financing development of the \ndeveloping member countries in the region, giving priority to those regional, sub-regional as well as national \nprojects and programs which will contribute most effectively to the harmonious economic growth of the region as a \nwhole, and having special regard to the needs of the smaller or less developed member countries in the region.\u201d  \n10  ADB issued the RCI Strategy in 2006. In this strategy, ADB identifies four pillars for RCI promotion: (i) cross-border \ninfrastructure and related regulations, procedures, and standards; (ii) trade and investment cooperation and \nintegration; (iii) monetary and financial cooperation and integration; and (iv) cooperation in regional public goods.  \nThe RCI operation Plan is scheduled to be released by June of 2016.   \n ", "3 \ncollective action on RCI spans many mechanisms that vary widely in terms of objectives, scope, \nstructure, and actors. This \u201cmulti-track\u201d and \u201cmulti-speed\u201d approach to cooperation has allowed \ndeveloping member countries to pursue RCI in a way that is responsive to their needs. ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for the PRC for the 2016-2020 period also placed high priority for \nADB support to the PRC\u2019s regional cooperation efforts as an honest broker. \n \n8.  ADB  first  used  the term  economic  corridor  in  1998,  and  defines  it as  networks  or \nconnections between economic agents along a defined geographic area, which link the supply \nand demand sides of markets. ADB pays significant attention to economic corridor development \nduring  its  RCI  operations. What  economic  corridors  can  achieve  for  RCI  depends  on  the \ncharacteristics of the existing specific economic networks in the economic corridors, and on the \ncharacteristics that a corridor development is intended to introduce or strengthen.11  \n \n9.  The  GMS  countries  adopted  the  economic  corridor  approach  during  the  8th  GMS \nMinisterial Meeting held in Manila in 1998, and major economic corridors have been identified \nand  are  being  developed,  including  the  North\u2013South  Economic  Corridor,  the  East\u2013West \nEconomic Corridor, and the Southern Economic Corridor.12 ADB supports the development of \nthe GMS economic corridors through design of master plan, creation and maintenance of \nforums  and  working  groups,  assistance  in  feasibility  and  engineering  studies,  and  fund \nmobilization. ADB\u2019s extensive experience regarding GMS economic corridor development can \nbe integrated into proposed PRC\u2013Mainland Southeast Asia economic corridor development.  \n \n10.  This  TA  will  examine  how  the  BRI  Initiative\u2014including  its  principles,  framework, \ncooperation  priorities,  and  latest  development  status\u2014and  analyze  ways  to  enhance \ncoordination between BRI and existing regional cooperation mechanisms. The TA will help to \nenhance the design of the PRC\u2013Mainland Southeast Asia economic corridor to strengthen \nconnectivity  between  economies,  improve  competitiveness  in  the  connected  market,  and \npromote regional public goods. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact will be realization of a new market opportunity for stakeholders along BRI \nareas. The outcome will be to help place of BRI in the overall RCI landscape, with an improved \ndesign of the PRC\u2013Mainland Southeast Asia economic corridor as a pilot case. The study will \nalso provide recommendations on how BRI can best coordinate with existing RCI mechanisms. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  Output 1: A comprehensive comparative study on the BRI Initiative and other \nrelevant regional cooperation and integration initiatives conducted. The TA will produce a \nflagship publication with two main parts: (i) a comprehensive comparative study of BRI and \nother relevant RCI initiatives and an analysis of BRI\u2019s positioning amid relevant regional and \nsubregional initiatives, and (ii) a road map for the development of the PRC\u2013Mainland Southeast \nAsia  economic  corridor  based  on  an  examination  of relevant  issues.

Output 2: Road map for the development of the PRC\u2013Mainland Southeast Asia \nEconomic Corridor prepared. Consultants and ADB researchers will review economic corridor \ndevelopment experience (on the part of ADB and other multilateral development banks); the \ndevelopment status of mainland Southeast Asia economies; and issues concerning international \nproduction network cooperation, connectivity between the PRC and mainland Southeast Asia, \nregional public goods, and regional competitiveness. The consultants will assess mainland \nSoutheast Asian countries' longer term development plans to find synergy or interface with BRI. \nBased on an analysis of these issues, a preliminary road map for corridor development and an \nimplementation plan will be prepared. The role of and ways to engage the private sector, plus \ncoordination with GMS and other existing RCI mechanisms will also be explored. \n \n14.  Output  3:  International  support  to  the  BRI  Initiative  enhanced.  Two  high-level \nconferences focusing on international policy dialogue will be conducted to allow policy makers \nand key stakeholders in mainland Southeast Asian countries to gain a better understanding of \nBRI and the PRC\u2013Mainland Southeast Asia economic corridor as a basis for future dialogue \namong the concerned countries. The first conference will focus on the scope of BRI and the \ninitiative\u2019s implications for RCI in Asia. The second will discuss best practices in economic \ncorridor development, coordination of GMS and existing RCI mechanisms, and approaches to \nthe development of the PRC\u2013Mainland Southeast Asia economic corridor that would enhance \nits competitiveness and ensure complementarity with other economic corridors. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $440,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of office space and local transport, remuneration and \nper diem of local support staff, equipment, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The Development Research Center of the State Council of the PRC will be the executing \nagency. The Development Research Center\u2019s International Cooperation Department will be the \nimplementing agency, and will coordinate and supervise the day-to-day work of the consultants \nand assume overall responsibility for workshops and conferences. \n \n17.  The proposed TA will be implemented from 30 June 2016 to 31 December 2017. The TA \nwill engage one international consultant (for 3 person-months) and four national consultants (for \n13 person-months). TA implementation will make extensive use of participatory workshops and \nconferences,  which  will  require  a  wide  range  of  skills  and  experience,  and  a  substantial \nprovision is therefore made for resource persons. The consultant terms of reference are in \nAppendix  3.  As  a  leading  institution  in  economic  corridor  development,  ADB  will  share \nknowledge and experience with the countries participating in the PRC\u2013Mainland Southeast Asia \neconomic corridor. ADB will set up a special study team within the RCI Thematic Group to work \nwith the executing agency during TA implementation. \n \n18.  The  consultants  will  be  hired  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in \n ", "5 \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). Consultants will be engaged individually. All reports (hard and electronic copies) \nwill  be  submitted  in  English  and  Chinese  to  both  ADB  and  the  executing  agency.  The \nconsultants will maintain close working relations with ADB and the executing agency and will \ndiscuss  progress  and  findings  regularly.  Tripartite  meetings  involving  ADB,  the  executing \nagency, and the consultants will be held when necessary to provide guidance to the consultants \nand to review draft reports. The implementing agency may use an advance payment facility for \ntraining and workshop administration. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China for Study of the Belt and Road Initiative, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nNew market opportunity for stakeholders along the BRI-covered areas realized (Vision and Actions on \nJointly Building Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road)a \n \nPerformance Indicators \nwith Targets and  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nPositioning of BRI in  a.
