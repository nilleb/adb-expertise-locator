INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will generate new knowledge and \nevidence, and build the capacity of stakeholders in developing member countries (DMCs) to \npursue transformative approaches to gender equality that will have a multiplier effect on both \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) operations and DMC policies and practices. The TA will support \naccelerating progress in gender equality, which is one of the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030.1 It will also support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5, \nwhich is dedicated to gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, in the Asia and Pacific region. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the 2018\u20132019 work plan of the Gender Equity Thematic Group \napproved by ADB Management. It will support the implementation of a new Gender Equality \nOperational Plan, 2019\u20132024.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  While Asia and the Pacific have made important progress on gender equality and women\u2019s \nempowerment since  1990,3 stubborn gender gaps  persist  across  all socioeconomic  areas. \nFemale labor force participation rates have declined; this is the only global region with this \nnegative trend. Girls are still less likely than boys to complete secondary education and pursue \nhigher levels of education. Subject segregation (wherein more boys study science, technology, \nengineering and mathematics, and information technology subjects than girls) contributes to the \nongoing feminization of nontechnical occupations and concentration of women in less-valued and \nunskilled jobs. Gender wage gaps remain very high across many DMCs, and women\u2019s access to \nleadership positions is among the lowest globally. On average, close to one in three women report \nan experience of intimate partner violence during their lifetime: this increases to one in two women \nin some DMCs (footnote 3). Increasing evidence points to the adverse impacts of such gender \ninequalities on development outcomes and economic growth: McKinsey estimates that the cost \nof gender inequality in Asia and the Pacific is up to $2.2 trillion.4 \n \n4.  The SDGs\u2019 transformative approach to development provides an important opportunity to \naccelerate progress on gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in Asia and the Pacific. The \ntransformative gender agenda is defined by the ambitious gender targets included in SDG 5 and \nacross other SDGs,5 which provide strategic entry points for challenging the discriminatory social \nnorms that drive such inequalities. Targets include gender-based violence, unpaid care and \ndomestic work, sexual and reproductive health and rights, women\u2019s participation in decision \nmaking and leadership, access to economic and productive resources, access to information and \ncommunication technology, and legal and institutional reforms. For Asia and the Pacific, adopting \na transformative approach to gender equality is particularly relevant given the rapidly changing \nregional context (e.g., demographic shifts, automation and digital transformations of the economy, \nand climate change), which threatens gender equality gains if a business-as-usual approach were \nto continue (footnote 3). \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 31 October 2018. \n3  ADB and UN Women. 2018.

Strategy 2030 offers an avenue for ADB to scale up support to its DMCs in responding to \nthese persistent and emerging gender challenges. Accelerating progress in gender equality is \none of Strategy 2030\u2019s seven operational priorities, which include gender targets for sovereign, \nas well as, for the first time, for nonsovereign operations. Building on its strong track record of \ninnovation in gender equality, ADB is also increasing its attention to SDG 5\u2019s transformative \ngender agenda under Strategy 2030 and the Gender Equality Operational Plan, 2019\u20132024. \nHowever, limited evidence and resources on \u201cwhat works\u201d to operationalize the transformative \ngender agenda are restricting operational opportunities. Stronger innovation, knowledge, and \nevidence that can demonstrate the development benefits of transformative gender approaches \nare needed to ensure that ADB can better support its DMCs in achieving SDG 5 by 2030. \n \n6.  Complementing this approach, the TA will also scale up the capacity development of \nexecuting and implementing agencies in DMCs to deliver gender-inclusive and transformative \nprojects.  Promoting  a  knowledge-action  loop  through  demonstration  effects,  capacity \ndevelopment, and knowledge-sharing events that are both cross-regional and cross-sectoral will \nfoster more opportunities to pursue and mainstream transformative gender agenda approaches \nacross a range of development areas at the country and regional levels. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) SDG 5-related gender equality results in \nADB operations improved in DMCs and (ii) Strategy 2030 gender targets supported. The TA will \nhave the following outcome: ADB operations (both sovereign and nonsovereign) integrating the \ntransformative gender agenda in DMCs increased.6 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output  1:  Evidence  and  knowledge  on  the  transformative  gender  agenda  in \noperations strengthened. This output will focus on action research subprojects, which ADB\u2019s \noperations departments will implement, with the aim to demonstrate the positive development \nimpacts of integrating a gender transformative agenda, as defined by the SDG 5 targets. The \nselection of subprojects drew on consultations with ADB\u2019s operations departments,7 with criteria \nfocusing  on  innovation,  relevance  for  future  sovereign  and  nonsovereign  ADB  operations, \ngeographic distribution and cross-regional comparability, and transformative development impact. \nFocus areas within the transformative gender agenda include unpaid care and domestic work, \naccess to economic and productive resources, access to digital technologies, and legal and \nregulatory reforms. Pending availability of future resources, the selection of DMCs and focus \nareas may be expanded. The following subprojects have been selected. \n \n9.  Under unpaid care and domestic work, subprojects will address a reduction in women\u2019s \ncare burden and time poverty. In the agribusiness sector, a subproject to be implemented by \nADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department will support the establishment of a training and \napprenticeship program for caregivers to support working parents in private companies. This will \ninclude formal accreditation training and apprenticeship opportunities, developing additional \n                                                \n6  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n7  Gender specialists were consulted for priority areas during the Annual Gender Consultation Workshop, 28\u201329 August \n2018. \n ", "3 \ntraining on caring for children with disabilities, and ongoing pedagogical skills development. In the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, a social norms campaign will address the unequal distribution \nof inter-household care responsibilities between women and men because of gendered roles. The \ncampaign, involving community leaders and media, will promote positive images of fatherhood, \nwhile providing mothers with a forum for networking and training on climate-friendly agribusiness. \n \n10.  Under access to economic and productive resources, subprojects will look at improving \nwomen\u2019s access to nontraditional male-dominated occupations through specialized training and \napprenticeship programs. In the city of Hetian in the People\u2019s Republic of China, women will be \ntrained and employed as bus drivers and maintenance mechanics. No women are currently \nemployed in these occupations in Hetian. In Pakistan, young women will be supported to pursue \ntechnical and vocational education and training, and to gain professional experience through an \napprenticeship program with selected companies in the energy sector. Female employees will \nalso benefit from additional upskill training programs designed to help them obtain relevant skills \nfor more senior responsibilities within the company. \n \n11.  Under  access  to  digital  technologies, subprojects  will  leverage  new  technologies  to \nimprove women\u2019s financial inclusion and women\u2019s health data availability. In Viet Nam, select \nfinancial institutions will undertake a comprehensive gender gap assessment of their business \ndevelopment products and services to identify how digital technologies and systems can improve \ntheir outreach to female clients and strengthen sex-disaggregated data on borrower profiles. In \nTonga, a forthcoming digital health program will capture gender data on SDG 3- and SDG 5-\nrelated topics  (including  maternal  health  and  adolescent  pregnancy), and  support  capacity \ndevelopment for the implementation of the health information system and use of gender statistics \nin decision making. This may also include further research on gender, health-seeking behavior, \nand referral pathways. \n \n12.  Under legal and regulatory reforms, a gender equality gap assessment of existing legal \nand regulatory frameworks will be undertaken in South Asia DMCs to identify future entry points \nfor ADB technical and/or financial support. \n \n13.  Data, evidence, and lessons learned from these subprojects will be captured in knowledge \nproducts and events, disseminated in DMCs and through the activities under output 2. A report \nanalyzing the development impacts and implications for ADB operations will be produced and \nmade available in digital and printed copies. \n \n14.  Output 2: Gender knowledge and capacity of DMCs enhanced. This output will focus \non strengthening awareness and institutional capacity in DMCs to pursue a gender transformative \nagenda. The activities will integrate the new evidence and data generated under output 1, with \nthe view to share knowledge with and reinforce the capacity of DMCs. Capacity development \nactivities will target key sector staff and gender focal points in executing and implementing \nagencies, national gender machineries in DMCs, and select private sector partners. These \nactivities build on existing ADB initiatives and experiences in strengthening knowledge and \ncapacity  within  executing  agencies  and  implementing  agencies,  and  promoting  knowledge \nsharing within the region. It has four sub-outputs: (i) one gender lateral learning event every two \nyears on a selected topic (e.g., digital technologies or unpaid care work), and support to DMC \nclients\u2019 participation in strategic gender events organized by non-ADB gender initiatives on the \ntransformative agenda; (ii) one Asia Women Leaders Program for senior women government \nofficers from \u201chard sectors\u201d (e.g. finance, transport, infrastructure) to strengthen their gender \nknowledge,  leadership,  and  communication  skills;  (iii)  two  external  forums  on  gender  and \ndevelopment organized to promote the transfer of state-of-the-art global knowledge and best \n ", "4 \npractices  on  operationalizing  a  gender  transformative  agenda;  and  (iv)  joint  research  and \nknowledge events with multilateral development banks and other development partners. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund ($1,500,000 from the TASF 6 and $500,000 from the TASF-\nother sources). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency and will administer the TA. The Gender Equity Thematic \nGroup Secretariat under ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department will \ncoordinate with the ADB operations departments that will implement the subprojects in output 1,8 \nas well as with other relevant sector and thematic groups and knowledge departments. The TA \nwill be implemented from January 2019 to December 2021. ADB will select, supervise, and \nevaluate consultants; organize workshops; and provide staff to act as resource persons in \ntrainings, seminars, conferences, and workshops. \n \n17.
