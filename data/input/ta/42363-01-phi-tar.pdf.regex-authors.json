INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the Philippines requested technical assistance (TA)1 from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to support the preparation of the Urban Water Supply and Sanitation \nProject.2 This project aims to improve water supply and sanitation (WSS) services in urban \nareas by providing investment capital and technical assistance to water districts.3 The country \noperations business plan4 for the Philippines shows the project as two projects: one for Metro \nCebu with TA approval in 2009 and loan approval in 2010 and one for Davao City with TA \napproval in 2010 and loan approval in 2011. It has been agreed to combine the projects and \ndesign the loan as a multitranche financing facility (MFF). A reconnaissance mission visited \nMetro Cebu and Davao City from 10 to 18 August 2010 and reached an understanding on TA \nimpact, outcome, outputs, activities, cost, implementation and financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference for consulting services. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Although water is abundantly available in the Philippines, urban areas face water stress.5 \nEspecially during the dry season, urbanization has brought a mismatch between water demand \nand supply caused by (i) increased population and demand and (ii) environmental pollution and \ndiminished supply.  \n \n3.  This mismatch caused a water crisis in Metro Manila in the early 1990s, resulting in the \nprivatization of the WSS services.6 Several other urban areas in the Philippines face the same \nproblems. Notably, two main economic centers, Metro Cebu in the Visayas and Davao City in \nMindanao, will experience a water crisis by 2015, while growing populations and the lack of \nincentives to invest in sanitation makes a sanitation crisis in these cities imminent.  \n \n4.  Averting a water crisis. Metro Cebu is the Philippines\u2019 second-largest metropolis, an \neconomic center in the Visayas with a population of 2.3 million, which is expected to grow to 4.0 \nmillion by 2030. The current net production capacity of 168,000 cubic meters per day is barely \nsufficient to supply 1.4 million consumers, or 35% of Metro Cebu\u2019s projected population. Davao \nCity is the third-largest urban area and the economic center of the southern Philippines. It has a \npopulation of 1.4 million, which is expected to grow to 2.5 million by 2030. The Davao City \nWater District (DCWD) serves 58% of the population with nine separate systems. Without \nexpansion, DCWD\u2019s raw water capacity is sufficient to supply 43% of Davao\u2019s population by \n2030. Both Cebu and Davao predominantly use groundwater from multiple points of supply. \nSurface water supplies less than 5% of demand.  \n \n5.  People without continuous potable water supply rely on either independent suppliers \nusing shallow groundwater sources or their own groundwater sources. These sources are within \ncity boundaries and exploit a polluted coastal aquifer. Further exploitation will lower groundwater \nlevels and cause land subsidence and saltwater intrusion. This will affect the capacity of water \ndistricts to expand and improve their services. Unless water districts aggressively expand their \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 20 August 2010.  \n2  Formerly the Metro Cebu and Davao City Water Supply and Sanitation Project. \n3  Water districts are government-owned and -controlled agencies tasked with providing water supply and sanitation \nservices to their mandated service areas. These services are the responsibility of local government units and over \n500 water districts. \n4  ADB. 2009. Philippines: Country Operations Business Plan 2010-2012. Manila \n5  Water stress occurs when demand for water exceeds supply for a period or poor water quality restricts its use. \n6  Republic Act No. 8041: Water Crisis Act, 1995. \n ", "2    \nwater-supply  capacity  and  distribution  systems,  both  urban  centers  will  face  significant \nshortages of drinking water and water quality problems.  \n \n6.  The need for a sanitary revolution.7 Water districts in the Philippines are mandated to \nprovide sanitation services. However, only a few have gone beyond collecting sludge from \nseptic tanks, which is commonly discharged in an uncontrolled manner in rivers and dumpsites. \nAlthough some capacity building has been provided by development agencies, it will not result \nin effective and sustainable sanitation and wastewater management without local government \nsupport, investment capital, and long-term capacity building. Ensuring sustainability requires \nthat initiatives be broadly supported by all stakeholders, notably communities. This support can \nbe  achieved  through  extensive  and  long-term  awareness  campaigns  aimed  at  behavioral \nchange and by creating demand for sanitary services.  \n \n7.  Strategic focus. The Philippine sector assessment, strategy, and roadmap for WSS8 \nrecognizes that low investment in WSS in urbanized areas of the Philippines worsens the \nincidence of water borne disease and environmental degradation, limiting the economic growth \npotential of these areas and worsening poverty. The project will address the following major \nsector  development  constraints  identified  in  the  assessment:  (i)  institutional  fragmentation, \nincluding a weak and fragmented regulatory framework; (ii) low performance by water utilities, \nincluding low tariffs and cost-recovery rates, (iii) low public and private investment in WSS; and \n(iv) low priority accorded to sanitation and hygiene and the lack of stakeholder involvement.  \n \n8.  The project aligns with (i) the country strategy and program, 2005\u201320079 by addressing \nthe development constraint of inadequate infrastructure, specifically with regard to water supply, \nand (ii) ADB\u2019s Water Financing Program,10 which aims to double investments in water and is \ndirected toward reform and capacity development. \n \n9.  Government strategies. Expanding WSS services is in line with the strategy of the \ngovernment, presented in the following documents: \n(i)  Philippine  Water  Supply  Sector  Roadmap,11 whose  targets  for  2025  are  (a) \nuniversal  coverage  and  sustained  utility  operations  and  (b)  existing  utilities\u2019 \ncontinuing to expand coverage on par with population growth;  \n(ii)  Philippine Sustainable Sanitation Roadmap,12 whose targets for 2028 are (a) \nuniversal access to safe and adequate sanitary facilities, (b) proper hygiene \npractices  in  families  and  communities,  and  (c)  mechanisms  for  sustainable \nsanitation; and \n(iii)  National Sewerage and Septage Management Program,13 which aims to improve \nwater quality and public health in urban areas of the Philippines by 2020 by \nenhancing  the  ability  of  local  implementers  to  build  and operate  wastewater \ntreatment  systems  for  urban  centers  and  promote  the  behavior  change  and \nsupporting environment needed for systems to be effective and sustainable.  \n \n                                                 \n7  The term commonly applied to the set of policies and actions implemented in Western Europe and North America, \nbeginning in the last third of the 19th century, following several cholera epidemics and the discovery of how water, \nsanitation, and hygiene were linked. \n8  Under preparation. \n9  ADB. 2005.

Private concessions in Metro Manila have demonstrated that the \noperational efficiency and quality of services can be improved if sound commercial management \nis applied. Although the operational efficiency of the Metro Cebu Water District (MCWD) and \nDCWD is acceptable, room for improvement exists. Private sector participation needs to be \nmaximized to reduce political interference, build autonomy in operations, and further improve \nthe water districts\u2019 efficiency and profitability.  \n \n11.  Gender  focus.  The  least-recognized  factors  affecting  the  health  and  well-being  of \nwomen  are  water,  sanitation,  and  hygiene.  The  benefits  of  these  basic  interventions  are \nextensive, affecting women and their daughters from generation to generation. Water is at the \ncore of women\u2019s traditional responsibilities: collecting and storing water, caring for children, \ncooking, cleaning, and maintaining sanitation. Better sanitary conditions are of the greatest \nimportance to women, providing greater privacy, convenience, safety, and dignity. \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s  and  development  partners\u2019  involvement  in  the  sector. Since 1993, ADB \nassistance in the sector totaled 13 loans and 9 TA projects, contributing significantly to the \ninstitutional strengthening of participating utilities and expanding services. ADB is currently \npreparing the Water District Development Sector Project to assist smaller water districts.14 \n \n13.  Other development partners also promote the competent delivery of services by water \nutilities and enterprises. The World Bank, in particular, vigorously supports the localization of \ninfrastructure  subprojects  by  directly  engaging  local  government  units,  community-based \norganizations, and businesses in investment financing and technical assistance interventions. \nThe United States Agency for International Development extends bilateral assistance through \ngrants and loans and is currently the biggest supplier of grants. Its major involvement in WSS is \nthe establishment of the Philippine Water Revolving Fund. German development cooperation \nthrough the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) aims to improve basic conditions \nfor developing the water sector through sustainable water-management technological solutions \nand  strengthened  interagency  coordination.  The  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency \nprovided assistance to small water districts and completed a water source development study \nfor Metro Cebu. \n \n14.  The main lessons of ADB\u2019s sector involvement are as follows: (i) The water district \nmodel is still the preferred service vehicle in urban areas because water districts are relatively \nindependent. (ii) Demand forecasts should be realistic to avoid excess supply infrastructure. (iii) \nMultiple executing agencies complicate project implementation and monitoring. (iv) Building the \ncapacity of water supply providers is critical to long-term success.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The impact of the TA will be improved access to water supply and sanitation services in \nselected urban areas by 2022. Service coverage providing access to continuous water supply at \nminimal pressure will increase from 50% of the population to 80%, while the coverage of access \nto hygienic sanitation will increase from 10% of the population to 50%. The outcome of the TA \nwill be an agreed design for an MFF by March 2012. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1, and the initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2.  \n \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2008. Preparing the Water District Development Sector Project. Manila. \n ", "4    \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The proposed project will be designed to (i) expand the raw water supply capacity of the \nwater  districts  by  reducing  physical  leakage  and  developing  new  bulk  water  sources;  (ii)  \nrehabilitate and  expand  water  distribution systems;  (iii)  raise  awareness  of  the benefits  of \nhygienic  sanitation  by  informing  communities  of  its  health  and  financial  benefits,  and  by \ninforming  policy  and  decision  of  the  economic  benefits  of  sanitation  and  wastewater \nmanagement; (iv) design and construct wastewater collection and disposal facilities; and (v) \ndevelop and implement a sanitation strategy.  \n \n17.  The TA will detail a project concept suitable for MFF financing by (i) reviewing the \nstrategic context as reflected in government strategic documents, (ii) developing a project road \nmap that indicates the strategic direction of the MFF, and (iii) developing a policy framework that \nidentifies the main challenges to ensure project efficiency and sustainability. Although the TA \nwill primarily focus on improving access to water supply and sanitation services in Metro cebu \nand Davao City, other urban areas with similar problems will be identified and included in the \nProject design for potential financing under the MFF. \n \n18.  Through socioeconomic surveys, analyses, and focus group discussions, the TA will \nfurther develop the project scope and confirm the design and monitoring framework, baseline \nand target indicators, and monitoring program. \n \n19.  The TA will prepare the implementation of the project by (i) assessing raw water supply \noptions,  such  as  surface  water,  groundwater,  and  desalination;  updating  water  demand \nforecasts; and preparing feasibility studies and preliminary designs of the most suitable options; \n(ii) assessing the amount of nonrevenue water, developing an asset management system, and \ndrawing  up  basic  designs  for  network  expansion  plans  and  management  strategies;  (iii) \ndeveloping sanitation awareness-raising campaigns and identifying pilot demonstration works; \n(iv) identifying and preparing feasibility studies and basic designs of urgent wastewater and \nseptage treatment works; and (v) carrying out consultations, developing financing and cost-\nrecovery mechanisms, and preparing an overall sanitation strategy. \n \n20.  To ensure the operational sustainability of investments, the TA will prepare a capacity \nbuilding and institutional development plan using (i) an assessment of technical, financial, and \nmanagement capacity gaps; (ii) strengths\u2013weaknesses\u2013opportunities\u2013threat analysis of utilities\u2019 \noperations; (iii) and a review of institutional settings, management and incentive structures, and \nlegal and regulatory frameworks. The potential role of the private sector will be assessed. \n \n21.  The TA will prepare an investment and procurement plan covering physical and other \ninvestment requirements. A detailed financing plan will be prepared using extensive willingness-\nto-pay and affordability analyses and projections of utilities\u2019 debt-servicing capacity and potential \ninternal revenue sources. Consultations with the government and financiers will identify potential \npublic and/or private financing sources and agree on the funding mechanism. \n \n22.  The TA will carry out due diligence on (i) energy efficiency and climate adaption and \nmitigation measures, including the preparation of a water safety plan; (ii) the impact of the \nproposed investments on poverty reduction and the social well-being of beneficiaries, including \nthe preparation of a gender action plan; and (iii) the proposed investments\u2019 impacts on the \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people and how to mitigate them in \naccordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Environmental, resettlement, and \nindigenous development frameworks will be prepared. The TA will assess governance issues, ", "  5\nfocusing on procurement capacity and risks, financial management, and corruption risks, and \nprepare a risk-management plan.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n23.  The TA is expected to cost the equivalent of $2.2 million, of which $2.0 million will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of France15 and administered by ADB. The \nGovernment of the Philippines will, through MCWD and DCWD, finance $200,000 equivalent in \nkind, covering the cost of office accommodation and utilities, remuneration and local transport \nfor counterpart staff, and training and workshop facilities. The government has been informed \nthat approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The cost estimate \nand financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  The TA executing agencies will be MCWD and DCWD, each of which will set up a \nproject management unit. About 184 person-months of consulting services, 44 international and \n140  national,  will  be  required.  MCWD  and  DCWD  will  carry  out  the  willingness-to-pay, \nsocioeconomic, and health surveys with assistance from ADB and individual consultants. The \nassessment of operational knowledge gaps and the capacity developed plan will be prepared, \nand  training  provided,  by  City  West  Water  (CWW),  a  government-owned  water  utility  in \nMelbourne,  Australia,  and  the  twinning  partner  of  MCWD  under  the  Water  Operators \nPartnership  Program  financed  by  ADB.16 CWW  has  program  that  was  used  to  make  a \npreliminary assessment of MCWD\u2019s capacity. Considering the nature of CWW\u2019s operations and \nexpertise, the availability an internally developed capacity assessment and training program, \nand CWW\u2019s knowledge of the Philippine water sector, CWW is the most suitable agency to \ncarry out these tasks. For other activities, ADB will recruit a team of international and national \nconsultants  to  provide  technical,  financial,  and  institutional  expertise,  engaging  them  in \naccordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime) using the quality- and cost-based selection method, with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20 and \nrequiring simplified technical proposals. Equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Equipment will be handed over \nto the executing agencies after TA completion. Disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The \noutline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. \n \n25.  The TA will be implemented over 15 months commencing around January 2011 and \nending around March 2012. Tripartite meetings of the government, ADB, and consultant team \nwill be held at TA inception, midterm, and completion. Key findings and outputs of the TA will be \ndisseminated through workshops and stakeholder discussions. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n26.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of France for Preparing the Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project. \n                                                 \n15 Through the Channel Financing Agreement (Technical Assistance Program) between the Government of France \nand ADB. \n16 ADB. 2008.

Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nThe country poverty assessment states that economic growth is necessary for poverty reduction and refers to well-\ndocumented links between improved health and reduced poverty. Furthermore, the country strategy and program, \n2005\u20132007 identifies inadequate infrastructure, such as for water supply and sanitation, as one of the main \nconstraints on more rapid progress in poverty reduction. The project will expand access to safe water and hygienic \nsanitation, thereby reducing the incidence of water-related diseases, stimulating economic growth, and reducing \npoverty in the project area. \n \nThe project will contribute to agenda No. 7, electricity and water for all, of the Medium-term Philippine Development \nPlan, 2004\u20132010. \n \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n General Intervention  \n Individual or Household (TI-H)  Geographic (TI-G)  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M7) \n \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \nThe project directly contributes to a reduction of the number of people without access to water supply and \nsanitation. \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n \n3.  What resources are allocated to the project preparatory TA and due diligence?  \nA full poverty analysis is not required. Further social analysis will be required as part of preparing the resettlement \nplan. \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit \nfrom the project?  \nThe urban poor will directly benefit from the project by gaining access to water and sanitation services. Project \ndesign will include measures to improve the access of the urban poor to these services. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \nAccess to safe water, education on hygienic practices, and sanitation facilities. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project \naddress them? \nAffordability will be the main issue, for which the project design will provide subsidies. Access to training and \neducation will be ensured through community-based approaches. \n \n \n \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \nLocal communities,  water supply companies,  local government agencies, and  national government agencies. \n \n2. What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the project preparatory TA or project \nprocessing  (e.g.,  workshops,  community  mobilization,  involvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  and \ncommunity-based organizations, etc.) \nConsultations take place mainly through workshops and direct consultations with community-based organizations, \nwater companies, and government agencies. \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \nStructural consultation and participation follows the existing methodologies and programs of the water supply \ndistricts, such as meetings, customer information, and consultation processes. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector and subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project or \nprogram?   \nThe limited size of distribution systems and limited availability of clean water mean many of the low-income and \npoor neighborhoods do not have household connections. Women in low-income and poor households bear the \nburden of collecting water from other sources or buying it from the vendors, which is more costly than public water \nsupply. Women are traditionally tasked with caring for sick family members, whose illnesses may be caused by the \nlack of safe water or hygienic sanitation, which increases the work and time burden on women. \n \n2.  Does the proposed project or program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s \nempowerment by improving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and \nparticipation in decision making?        Yes          No    Please explain. \n \nThe project will promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. It will provide direct benefits to women as a \nresult of household water connections. Women and girls will spend less time collecting water, and the time saved \ncan be used for other productive or income-generating activities. Women\u2019s inclusion as key beneficiaries of the pilot \nsanitation and hygiene projects will help to increase their knowledge of sanitation and hygiene practices, as well as \ntheir ability to plan and manage projects and finances on their own. This may increase the visibility of women in \nplanning and management positions, leading in the future to more opportunities for women to participate in decision \nmaking in their communities. Training women in design, implementation, and operation and maintenance will build \ntheir skills and increase employment opportunities in a traditionally male-dominated field, thus breaking gender \nstereotypes in learning and employment. The development of a gender-sensitive sanitation strategy will ensure that \nwomen\u2019s needs and interests are integrated, which will affect interventions in the sector as a whole. A gender \nspecialist will be recruited as part of the project preparatory technical assistance to undertake a gender analysis. A \ngender action plan will be prepared to ensure that women\u2019s needs and interests are integrated into project design \nand that women benefit from project processes, outputs, and outcome. \n \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or widen gender inequality?    \n          Yes          No    Please explain  \nLoss of traditional land rights and livelihood will be addressed through mitigation measures under the resettlement \nplan. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 2   11 \nIII.
