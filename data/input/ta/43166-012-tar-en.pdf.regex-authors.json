", "         1  \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  In recent consultations with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Government of \nIndia acknowledged ADB\u2019s significant role in strengthening processing of the India program by \nfast-tracking projects and enhancing capacity development. In this context, the Government \nemphasized  the  need  for  ADB  support  for  intensive  project  preparedness  and  capacity \ndevelopment  in  poorer  states  and  pro-poor  sectors.  ADB  intends  to  respond  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s request with a cluster technical assistance (TA) to support identified projects in \npoorer  states  and  pro-poor  sectors,  and  develop  local  capacity  for  improved  project \nimplementation. The Government concurs with the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation \narrangements,  and  cost  and  financing  arrangements  of  the  cluster  TA.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. 1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  About 302 million of India\u2019s population lives below the national poverty line.2 National \npoverty  in  2004/05  is  estimated  to  be  27.5%,  down  from  36%  in  1993/94  and  54.9%  in \n1973/74.3 Despite this improvement, 390 million currently live on less than $1 a day, 460 million \nat less than $1.25 a day,4 and about 630 million at less than $1.35 a day.5 About 233 million of \nIndia\u2019s population are undernourished, representing 43% of Asia\u2019s total. In 2004/05, 28.3% of \nresidents of rural areas were living in poverty compared with 25.7% in urban areas (footnote 3). \nThe global economic crisis triggered unemployment in a few key labor-intensive sectors, and \nslowed growth rates in manufacturing, potentially compounding poverty impacts. \n \n3.  Regional disparities in poverty persist. State poverty incidence reaches highs of 46.4% \nfor Orissa, 41.4% for Bihar, 40.9% for Chhattisgarh, and 40.3% for Jharkhand. The Government \nidentifies Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, \nand Uttarakhand as needing more comprehensive interventions.  \n \n4.  On 30 June 2006, ADB approved a cluster TA for $15 million.6 The said cluster TA \ndirectly  contributed  to  enhancing  project  preparedness,  improving  project  design,  and \nstrengthening effective implementation capacity for projects under ADB\u2019s India program (2006\u2013\n2010). It provided capacity development support to help improve the operating capacity of \nexecuting agencies in states such as Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Orissa. Specific \ncapacity  development  assistance  was  provided  in  subsectors  such  as  clean  development \nmechanism, integrated water resource management, tourism planning, environmental planning, \npublic\u2013private partnerships, and municipal innovations in urban sector projects. These early \ninitiatives for poorer states and pro-poor sectors need to be consolidated to ensure sustainability \nand  development  effectiveness.  The  experience  in  implementing  the  said  cluster  TA \nsubstantiated this need, and generated deep interest and the subsequent Government request \nfor a follow-on facility for low-income states and pro-poor sectors.   \n \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 June 2009. \n2  The all-India average poverty line of 2004/05 translates to $0.30 per capita per day in rural areas and $0.45 per \ncapita per day in urban areas based on August 2007 dollar equivalent rates. \n3 Government of India. 2007.

Over the past decade, ADB, at the request of the Government, has moved its focus to \ncomparatively  less-developed  states  that  have  limited  financial  and  technical  capacity  to \nundertake detailed project design. ADB is committed to assisting these states and executing \nagencies not only in formulating projects for sustainable development but also in developing \ntheir long-term capacities to plan and implement projects. \n \n6.  Some states require limited support in the form of incremental consulting services, while \nothers require extensive support, including detailed design, cutting across the boundaries of \ncapacity development, policy and advisory, and project preparatory TA. A facility like the cluster \nTA provides the flexibility to meet diverse and fast-emerging requirements, and to be relevant, \nresponsive, and results-oriented.  \n \n7.  The ADB policy on cluster TA excludes their use for project preparatory TA (PPTA).7 A \nwaiver of this was sought under the previous cluster TA and approved by the Board on 30 June \n2006 (footnote 6). This allowed inclusion of PPTA under the stated cluster TA. In a similar \nmanner for the proposed cluster TA, a waiver of PPTA exclusion is requested. This is based on \nthe encouraging experience of the said cluster TA in terms of enhanced project preparedness, \nclient  ownership,  comprehensive  monitoring  by  ADB  and  the  Government,  flexibility  in \nresponding to client needs, and capacity development (para. 4). \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED CLUSTER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The proposed cluster TA, formulated in close consultation with the Government, will \nfacilitate enhanced preparedness of ADB-supported projects in poorer states and pro-poor \nsectors. This will encompass a full range of activities including feasibility studies, preliminary \ndesign, due diligence, detailed design, and preparation and evaluation of bid documents, up to \nthe point of readiness for contract award. The cluster TA will ensure that sufficient capacity is \nbuilt for effective project implementation. Enhanced project preparedness, improved design, and \nbetter capacity for effective implementation created through this cluster TA will greatly impact \nthe quality and speed of delivery of proposed infrastructure and development investment in \nlower-income states and sectors identified as essential for inclusive and sustainable growth and \npoverty reduction. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The  cluster  TA  will  support  advanced  preparation  of  projects  in  the  India  program \nthrough  component  TA  projects  encompassing  varying  project  preparation  and  capacity \ndevelopment requirements for effective implementation. The cluster TA will reduce project start-\nup time after its approval, reduce the number of stand-alone TA projects in the India program, \nbuild critical project implementation capacity in lower-income states, strengthen the direct and \nindirect contribution to poverty reduction and more inclusive growth in the respective state, and \nenhance government ownership of ensuing projects. \n \n10.  Component TA projects to be included under the cluster TA were carefully selected from \nthe India program in terms of representing the poorest states in India or the pro-poor nature of \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1997.

A  strong  focus  is  placed  on  the  poorest  states  of  Bihar, \nChhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, and Rajasthan, among others. The pro-poor \nsectors in the ADB India program, such as water resources management, agriculture, rural \ndevelopment, development of less-developed regions, and urban poverty reduction, are well \nrepresented.  \n \n11.  Component TA projects are identified for 2009 and 2010.  \n \nProjects for 2009 include \n \n(i)   Capacity Development of Bihar Power Sector Entities ($0.5 million);  \n(ii)   Capacity Development in Value Chain Management for Agribusiness \n($0.6 million); \n(iii)   Capacity Development for Agribusiness Value Chains and Marketing Legal \nFramework in Bihar ($0.25 million);  \n(iv)   Capacity Development for Community-Based Flood Risk Management in Assam \n($0.5 million);  \n(v)   Capacity Development for Sustainable Coastal Protection and Management \n($0.2 million);  \n(vi)   Capacity Development for the Jharkhand State Roads Sector ($0.75 million);  \n(vii)   Madhya Pradesh State Roads III ($0.6 million);  \n(viii)   Preparing an Investment Plan for Himachal Pradesh Urban Development \n($0.5 million);  \n(ix)   Capacity Development for Rural Cooperative Credit Structure Reform (attached \nto the Rural Cooperative Credit Restructuring and Development Program) ($2.0 \nmillion);8 \n(x)   Water Users Association Empowerment for Improved Irrigation Management in \nChhattisgarh (attached to Chhattisgarh Irrigation Development Project) ($0.7 \nmillion);9 and  \n(xi)   Support for the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, Phase II \n($2.2 million).  \n \nProjects identified for 2010 include \n \n(i)  Preparing Integrated Coastal Protection and Management ($0.9 million); \n(ii)  Uttarakhand Energy Efficiency ($0.8 million);  \n(iii)  Developing the Orissa Public Resource Management Program ($0.3 million);  \n(iv)  Preparing the Madhya Pradesh Urban Environmental Improvement Project II \n($0.7 million);  \n(v)  Rajasthan Urban Development, Phase III ($0.6 million); and  \n(vi)  Land Transport Management and Master Plan for Sikkim ($1.0 million). \n \n12.

Cost and Financing \n13.  The cluster TA, with a cost of $14,000,000, will be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom.10 ADB will administer the TA. The Government will provide \ncounterpart contributions in kind estimated at $3,500,000. Details of the cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2, Table A2.1.  \n \n14.  The estimated funding requirement for each of the proposed component TA projects is in \nAppendix 2, Table A2.2. The Government was advised that approval of the cluster TA does not \ncommit ADB to financing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Department of Economic Affairs of the Government will be the Executing Agency for \nthe cluster TA. The state governments or other department agencies or institutions under the \nrelated component TA projects will be the implementing agencies.          \n \n16.  A  joint  cluster  TA  advisory  committee  (JTAC)  will  be  constituted  to  provide  overall \nguidance  on  programming  and  critical  project-related  aspects  of  the  cluster  TA.  The  joint \nsecretary of the Department of Economic Affairs and the country director of the ADB India \nResident Mission will cochair the JTAC. Relevant sector directors of the ADB  South Asia \nDepartment (SARD), sector specialists from the resident mission, project officers of the cluster \nTA, and project officers of the component TA projects under the cluster TA will be members of \nthe JTAC.  \n \n17.  The responsibilities of the JTAC will include (i) addition or deletion of component TA \nprojects in the cluster TA, and (ii) review of monitoring reports on the status of component TA \nprojects. The JTAC will, based on the information available, discuss (i) progress on each of the \ncomponent TA projects; and (ii) key issues and problems and proposed solutions. Timing and \nimplementation arrangements of component TA projects of the cluster TA will be determined by \nSARD director general based on the outlined scope and indicative budget provided herein with \nappropriate adjustment, if required, within the total funds and overall implementation time frame \nof the cluster TA.  \n \n18.  The ADB India Resident Mission will nominate a project officer and project support team \nfor the cluster TA as a whole. Project officers of component TA projects will provide semiannual \ninputs to the cluster TA project officer. Monitoring will be against (i) progress with project \nimplementation milestones for project preparedness and (ii) disbursements, among others. The \nDepartment of International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom will be provided copies \nof the progress reports. The project officer of the cluster TA will provide an information paper \n                                                 \n10 The Government of United Kingdom through the Department for International Development (DFID) has confirmed \nits intention vide its letter dated 17 December 2008 to support this partnership to focus on the poorest states in \nIndia where ADB has operations. The joint understanding between DFID and ADB also encompasses the pro-poor \nsectors in the ADB India program. ", "         5  \nannually, to inform the ADB Board of Directors of progress under the cluster TA. This will ensure \nmonitoring of the cluster TA by ADB Management and the Board. \n \n19.  For streamlined processing of component TA projects under the cluster TA, three types \nof component TA projects are identified: \n \n(i)  Type A. This includes component TA projects ready to commence implementation \nupon approval of the cluster TA. The five component TA projects listed under type A \n(para.  20)  will  commence  implementation  upon  the  endorsement  of  the  SARD \ndirector general.    \n \n(ii)  Type B. This includes component TA projects in the 2009 India program that will be \nprocessed separately for approval of the SARD director general as and when they \nare  ready  for  implementation.  It  also  includes  proposed  2010  component  TA \nprojects  and  those  attached  to  loans  that  are  under  processing.  In  line  with \nrequirements for processing component TA projects, the Type B component TA \nprojects  will  require  a  memorandum  outlining  the  outcomes,  scope,  intended \noutputs,  cost  estimates,  budget,  implementation  arrangements,  implementation \nschedule, terms of reference for consultants, consultant selection methods, and \nother aspects, as appropriate. Each of these component TA projects will be subject \nto review by departments and/or offices concerned before submission to the head of \nthe department for approval.  \n \n(iii)  Type C. This includes TA projects approved earlier by ADB, and funded by the \nUnited Kingdom Cooperation Fund for Technical Assistance (DFID Trust Fund). \nThese are being included under this cluster TA to facilitate smooth transition to the \nnew partnership arrangement financed by the Government of the United Kingdom. \n \n20.  Type A component TA projects include (i) Capacity Development of Bihar Power Sector \nEntities;  (ii)  Capacity  Development  for  Sustainable  Coastal  Protection  and  Management; \n(iii) Capacity  Development  for  Jharkhand  State  Roads  Sector;  (iv)  Madhya  Pradesh  State \nRoads III; and (v) Support for the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, Phase II. \nConcept papers for these component TA projects are in Appendix 4. The detailed TA paper for \nthe component TA on the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, Phase II, and the \ninitial poverty and social assessment for the Madhya Pradesh State Roads III PPTA are in \nSupplementary Appendix A and B.  \n \n21.  Type  B  component  TA  projects  include  (i)  Capacity  Development  in  Value  Chain \nManagement for Agribusiness, (ii) Capacity Development for Agribusiness Value Chains and \nMarketing  Legal  Framework  in  Bihar,  (iii) Preparing  for  Integrated  Coastal  Protection  and \nManagement, (iv) Preparing an Investment Plan for Himachal Pradesh Urban Development, (v) \nUttarakhand  Energy  Efficiency,  (vi) Developing  the  Orissa  Public  Resource  Management \nProgram, (vii) Preparing the Madhya Pradesh Urban Environmental Improvement Project II, (viii) \nRajasthan  Urban  Development  Phase  III,  (ix) Capacity  Development  for  Community-Based \nFlood Risk Management in Assam, and (x) Land Transport Management and Master Plan for \nSikkim. Concept papers for these component TA projects are in Appendix 4. \n \n22.  Since Type C component TA projects include two already approved TA projects, only a \nchange in funding source from the previous DFID Trust Fund to the current partnership is \nsought. These include (i) Capacity Building for Rural Cooperative Credit Structure Reform \n(attached to the Rural Cooperative Credit Restructuring and Development Program), and (ii) \n ", "6    \nWater Users Association Empowerment for Improved Irrigation Management in Chhattisgarh \n(attached to the Chhattisgarh Irrigation Development Project). TA papers as already approved \nfor these two component TA projects are in Supplementary Appendix C and D. \n \n23.  A consolidated cluster TA completion report will be prepared for the cluster TA. No \nseparate TA completion reports need to be prepared for the component TA projects. The \nmission leaders for each component TA project will provide complete information to the project \nofficer of the cluster TA for preparing the consolidated completion report.  \n \n24.  Each of the component TA projects will require a team of consultants to be engaged \nseparately. Cost estimates for the consulting services, both international and national, were \nprepared in consultation with project divisions of the component TA projects. However these are \nestimates that will be finalized during preparation of component TA project implementation \nplans. The broad requisite fields of expertise are in Appendix 3, and will be detailed in the \ncomponent TA project documents.  \n \n25.  Consultants under various component TA projects will be engaged in accordance with \nthe Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of national and international consultants. \nConsultant packages identified for each component TA project will comprise both firms and \nindividuals as appropriate. Overall, estimates indicate a requirement of 200 person-months of \ninternational and 1,250 person-months of national consulting services. Given the overall scale of \nconsulting  services  requirements,  and  accompanying  staff  resource  implications  for  the \nconsulting services division, project officers of component TA projects are encouraged to use \nthe services of consulting firms where possible. \n \n26.  In the case of small contracts, purchase of equipment and related procurement activities, \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  will  be  followed. \nEquipment  procured  will  be  handed  over  to  the  respective  implementing  agencies  of  the \ncomponent TA projects. Active involvement of stakeholders will be assured through workshops, \nas necessary. Disbursements under the cluster TA and component TA projects will be made in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.11 \n \n27.  The cluster TA will ensure enhanced ownership by the executing and implementing \nagencies  due  to  their  involvement  from  the  initial  stages  of  project  design  and  enhanced \ncapacity for implementation, among others. Under the cluster TA the responsibilities of the \nmission leaders will be enhanced to include for each component TA project, (i) preparation of \ncomponent TA project in terms of outlined scope and indicative budget provided herein with \nappropriate  adjustment,  if  required,  implementation  plans  and  their approval  by  the  SARD \ndirector  general  as  required,  (ii)  identification  of  capacity  development  requirements,  and  \n(iii) support for monitoring of component TA projects, to assess risks and suggest midcourse \ncorrections; among other aspects (para. 17). \n \n28.  The cluster TA will be implemented over 3 years from 1 September 2009 to 31 August \n2012. \n                                                 \n11 ADB.2008.

Link to country partnership strategy and/or regional cooperation strategy  \nThe Electricity Act, 2003, is the cornerstone legislation for power in India, and provides the legal framework for its efficient \ndevelopment. The Act primarily focuses on the restructuring of state electricity boards, open access, and competition. In \nBihar, reforms required by the Electricity Act are still evolving, although by most measures reform has fallen behind the rest \nof India. The state government of Bihar recently began passing legislation for reforms, and is in the process of finalizing its \nfinancial restructuring plan for the Bihar State Electricity Board (BSEB). Eight new successor companies to BSEB are now \nformally registered with the Registrar of Companies\u2014one holding company, one generation company, one transmission \ncompany, and five distribution companies. A draft transfer scheme for all assets, liabilities, and personnel from BSEB to the \nnew  companies  is  currently  under  discussion  with  all  stakeholders.  The  three-member  Bihar  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission (BERC) was set up and issued its first retail tariff notification for the 2008 financial year.  \n \nBSEB has limited institutional capacity as a consequence of constraints on recruitment of professional staff for the past 20 \nyears. Compounding the skill shortage within the organization is the absence of adequate training programs to develop \nemployees, and minimal computer use by professional staff. Consequently, BSEB\u2019s ability to tackle the issue of rampant \nlosses; and to plan for the efficient expansion, and the technical and financial management of the state\u2019s electricity assets is \nlimited. The unbundling of BSEB will exacerbate the problem in the short term, as it will create the need for new technical \nskills and for timely completion of accounts for multiple companies rather than just for the consolidated BSEB. \n \nAn underlying feature of the Electricity Act is the requirement to establish state electricity regulatory commissions, with \nconsiderable responsibilities to promote sector reform in their respective states. The act requires the commissions to \ndetermine tariffs; regulate power purchase arrangements between generators and distribution companies; facilitate intrastate \ntransmission and electricity wheeling; and issue licenses for  intrastate transmission, distribution, and power trading. \nAdditional responsibilities include adjudicating disputes between sector companies, promoting cogeneration and renewable \nenergy, specifying grid codes, and enforcing quality and reliability standards. \n \nBERC was established in 2002 under the provisions of the Electricity Regulatory Commission Act, 1998, and was made \nfunctional in 2005 under provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003. BERC\u2019s mandate is to introduce transparency and economic \nregulation to the sector. With the unbundling of the vertically integrated BSEB into generation, transmission, and distribution \ncompanies, and various sector companies, BERC will be expected to act beyond the statutory roles prescribed for it, and be \nactively involved in the evolving state policy-making with an objective of improving the financial health of the sector. This will \ninclude providing guidance and advice to new participants in power, and initiating discussions in critical areas such as power \nprocurement from renewable sources and demand-side management. In addition, BERC will need to pass interim orders in \nany proceeding, hearing, or matter before it; examine books and accounts related to generation, transmission, distribution \nsupply, or utilization of electricity; and impose penalties for contravention of licensing provisions.  \n \nBERC is a young organization that heavily depends on external consultants for its daily operations. In line with the provisions \nof the Electricity Act, 2003, a new organization chart for BERC and job descriptions for key positions were prepared and \nagreed to in principle by the state government. The new organization chart reflects the evolving regulation requirements and \nexperiences in other states of India. BERC will need to commence the process of staffing BERC in accordance with the \napproved structure. \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance will help the state government of Bihar through the following \ncomponents: \n \nComponent 1: Assist BERC in assessing a reporting framework for power entities it oversees, including available information \nand  data  requirements.  Based  on  this  assessment,  it  will  determine  user  requirements  and  identify  the  functional \nspecifications of a computer system, and assist BERC in developing a methodology for computing the cost of supply at \nvarious voltages.  \n \nComponent 2: Develop capacity in BSEB and successor entities through training programs and computerization. Training \nprograms will include transmission and distribution system planning, which is considered essential to reduce rampant \nelectricity losses.  \n \nb.   Impact  \nComponent 1: The presence of an effective regulator will enhance the efficiency of power delivery to end consumers through \nperformance improvements and transparency. Improved efficiency and effectiveness will relieve or at least lessen the \nburden of power generation and distribution on the state budget, and will facilitate economic development by removing \nimpediments to growth and allowing reallocation of scarce public resources. \n ", "16  Appendix 4 \n \n \nComponent 2: Capacity development of BSEB will improve the technical skills and thus the operating performance of BSEB, \nand assist with the unbundling process as mandated by the Electricity Act, 2003. \n \nc.   Outcome  \nThe CDTA will result in (1) BERC operating as an independent electricity regulatory commission, and a transparent \nregulatory framework for the power industry in Bihar; and (2) BSEB will have the capacity to implement the proposed ADB \nproject efficiently  \n \nd.

Link to country partnership strategy and/or regional cooperation strategy  \nThe  CDTA  is  associated  with  the  proposed  Agribusiness  Infrastructure  Development  Program  (AIDP).  Support  for \nagribusiness development in India is consistent with Asian Development Bank (ADB) strategy, which recognizes that greater \ncrop diversification and value addition in agriculture has the potential to significantly reduce poverty and improve the quality \nof life in rural India. The AIDP and CDTA are also in line with the 11th Five Year Plan (2008\u20132012), which addresses the \nthree main constraints to agriculture growth: (i) out-of-date technologies, (ii) lack of public investment in basic infrastructure, \nand (iii) limited diversification. \n \nAgricultural growth has fallen from an average of 3.5% during 1982\u20131997 to around 2% during 1998\u20132005. This has \nadversely affected the rural economy, and the overall level of poverty and social development in the country. The sector \nemploys 56.7% of the country\u2019s workforce and provides livelihood to two thirds of the population. The rural\u2013urban divide has \nworsened, and per capita household expenditure in rural India is estimated to now be less than half that in urban areas. With \nnearly three quarters of the country\u2019s poor (or nearly 220 million people) living in rural areas, agriculture and rural \ndevelopment are critical to poverty reduction and inclusive development. Two thirds of India\u2019s population derives their \nlivelihood from agriculture, which is dominated by a large number of small farmers: of the nearly 120 million individual farm \nholdings comprising 170 million hectares (ha), roughly 60% are less than 1 ha while another 20% are only 1\u20132 ha. \n \nGiven high inefficiencies and extremely high post harvest losses, development of agribusiness could have strong multiplier \neffects on employment, equitable income growth throughout the economy, reduced vulnerability, household food security, \nand higher farm and non farm incomes that can lead to poverty reduction. Diversification of Indian agriculture and increased \nefficiencies in the value chain will contribute to the goal of reducing poverty by raising the productivity of land and water \nresources in a sustainable manner, and augmenting the accrued economies. Private sector participation in such activities \ncan reduce the burden on central and state finances, and ensure greater efficiency. \n \nb.   Impact  \nThe concepts and practices of value chain management in commercial agriculture need greater dissemination in India. The \nCDTA will promote the understanding of stakeholders regarding various agribusiness-related commercial business models \nand on how integrated value chain management can improve agriculture marketing. It will contribute to improved investment \ndecisions in commercially viable integrated business models along the agricultural value chains developed under the \nAgribusiness Infrastructure Development Project in Bihar and Maharashtra. At the same time, the CDTA activities will give \nhigher bargaining power to farmers, including smallholders, and female and poor farmers, upgrading their position in the \nvalue chain and providing a greater share of the returns accruing from the chain to them. \n \nc.   Outcome  \nThe CDTA will help generate awareness about integrated value chain management among agribusiness stakeholders of the \nvalue chains developed under the AIDP in Bihar and Maharashtra. \n \nd.   Outputs \nOutputs will comprise the following: (i) better access for producers to markets and facilities for adding value to agricultural \nproduce; (ii) greater bargaining power for producers through collective (group) initiatives, resulting in higher net price \nrealization for their produce by about 10%\u201312%; (iii) better economies of scale for traders and processors by enabling them \nto deal with groups of producers rather than with individual farmers, and improving opportunities for long-term contract \nfarming; and (iv) better quality of produce at lower prices for consumers due to lower wastage during transit and handling. \n \nThe CDTA has three components: (i) component 1: supporting the formation of farmer groups and producer companies as \nthe first step in setting up efficient integrated value chains for high-value crops in Bihar and Maharashtra; (ii) component 2: \ndeveloping mechanisms such as contract farming to coordinate production, distribution, and retail arrangements between \ndifferent stakeholders along the value chains of high-value crops in Bihar and Maharashtra; and (iii) component 3: building \nstakeholder  capacity  on  value  chain  approaches  by  developing  their  skills  in  different  chain  activities  and  in  chain \nmanagement decision-making. \n13. Assumptions and Risks   \nThe private sector's willingness to invest in the development of agriculture value chains and small farmers' willingness to \ndiversify to high-value-added crops and integrate into the value chains are essential for successful development of the value \nchains. The risk is insufficient willingness and participation of the private sector and small farmers in this initiative.  \n \n \n ", "20  Appendix 4 \n \n14. Implementation Arrangements \n \na.

Department, Division: SARD, SANS     \n11. Key Development Issues to be Addressed  \nAgriculture\u2019s share of India's gross domestic product (GDP) has steadily declined\u2014from 56% in 1950 to 18% in 2007\u2014with \nrapid growth of the services sector. The agriculture sector remains significant\u2014economically, socially, and politically\u2014\nproviding livelihoods to about 58% of India's population. Despite the huge production base and huge domestic market, \nagribusiness is poorly developed. Three broad indicators are (i) exports as a percentage of total production, (ii) processed \nfood as a percentage of agricultural production, and (iii) movement of products within the country. The low quality of \ndecision making among the bulk of the country\u2019s agribusiness participants is partly to blame. They include individual \nproducers, directors of market-oriented organizations (such as self-help groups and producer cooperatives), and officials of \nline departments and non-government organizations. Most directors in the country\u2019s legion of primary producer agribusiness \ncooperatives lack appropriate administrative management skills. In addition, the present marketing and processing systems \nare characterized  by long  and fragmented supply  chains, high  wastage,  poor infrastructure, and excessive  market \nregulations. Farmers are not effectively integrated into the agricultural value chain; and agro enterprises have weak linkages \nwith farmers, consumers, service providers (research, extension, finance), and international markets. All these factors \ncontribute to slow agribusiness development, limiting the generation of off-farm employment. \n \nBihar, the third most populous state in India, accounts for one seventh of the country\u2019s population living below the poverty \nline. The state has a high rate of persistent poverty, weak governance, and inadequate infrastructure. Bihar has the lowest \nper capita income among the major states of India, less than a quarter of the national average. Occupational structure \nreveals the dependence of the majority of the work force on agriculture. The agriculture sector accounts for more than 80% \nof the state\u2019s workforce. The state is the third largest producer of vegetables and sixth largest producer of fruits in India. Yet \nthe agriculture sector contributes to only 40% of the state\u2019s GDP. The average size of landholding in Bihar is 0.75 ha, half \nthe national average. Small and marginal farms constitute 91% of total landholdings.  \n \nStudies by the National Horticulture Mission identify the paucity of skilled human resources, especially in horticulture; and a \nnumber of failures in export-oriented units based on capital intensive imported technology. Lack of skills contributes to these \nfailures.  Nongovernment  organizations  and  line  departments  have  capacity  limitations  in  understanding  modern \nagribusiness concepts. Their approach concentrates primarily on physical infrastructure without planning for a shift to \ninstitutional arrangements to ensure proper utilization and be more suitable for a modern business environment.  \n \nThe 1960 Bihar Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act aimed to improve regulation of buying and selling of \nagricultural produce, and to establish markets for agricultural produce in Bihar state, as well as accompanying issues. The \nBihar Agricultural Produce Markets Act had the same salient features of the APMC Act and prohibited transactions outside \nthe \u201cmarket\u201d established under the act. In 2006, the Bihar government, advocating the principles of a free market, repealed \nthe APMC Act by bringing into force the Agriculture Produce Market (Repeal) Act, 2006, with immediate effect. The repeal \nof the APMC Act created a regulatory vacuum in the state\u2019s agriculture sector. Although the legal framework of the country \nprovides certain rights and remedies under the prevailing civil and criminal statutes, enforcing any right or availing of any \nremedy under the prevailing legal framework is a lengthy and expensive process. In such a situation, the farmers dealing \nwith perishable commodities will be most adversely affected. At this nascent stage of development of the agriculture sector, \na regulated environment is needed for market participants to safeguard the interests of various stakeholders, including \nfarmers, and to encourage private sector participation. \n12. TA Description  \na.   Link to country partnership strategy and/or regional cooperation strategy  \nThe CDTA is associated with the proposed Agribusiness Infrastructure Development Investment Program (AIDIP). The \nAIDIP and CDTA are in line with the 11th Five Year Plan (2008\u20132012), which addresses the three main constraints to \nagriculture growth: (i) out-of-date technologies, (ii) lack  of public investment in basic infrastructure, and (iii) limited \ndiversification. Supporting agribusiness development in India is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nstrategy, recognizing that greater crop diversification and value addition in agriculture has the potential to significantly \nreduce poverty and improve quality of life in rural India.  \n \nb.  Impact  \nRecognizing that the concepts and practices of value chain management in commercial agriculture are not very well-known \nin Bihar, the CDTA will promote effective stakeholder understanding of a commercial business model and integrated value \nchain management to meet the needs of improved marketing and market predictability for agribusinesses. The CDTA \nimpact will be more efficient value chain management by agribusiness stakeholders in selected horticultural chains in Bihar.  \n \nc.   Outcome  \nThe expected outcomes of the CDTA are improved investment decisions and business practices resulting from use of a \ncommercially viable integrated business model along the value chain by participating stakeholders in selected horticultural \nvalue  chains  in  Bihar.  The  CDTA  will  also  help  (i)  improve  institutional  capacity  for  effective  implementation  and \nmanagement of the AIDIP, (ii) strengthen the institutional capacity of agribusiness development government agencies and \n ", "24  Appendix 4 \n \nfarming communities, and (iii) strengthen the legal framework for agricultural marketing. \n \nd.  Outputs \nCDTA outputs include (i) enhanced capacity of agribusiness stakeholders (farmers, traders, processors, service providers, \nand government officials) in understanding and using value chain principles, technologies, management, and operation, \n(ii) trained agricultural professionals with updated skills in sustainable agricultural practices, and the ability to use new \ninformation and communication technologies to access and evaluate relevant electronic information and knowledge; \n(iii) new and stronger institutional capacity for management, service delivery, resource generation and management, and \nparticipatory and accountable governance of public sector organizations involved in agribusiness; and (vi) a new legal \nalternative to repeal of the APMC Act, if needed, by completing a study on the regulatory framework for agricultural \nmarketing in Bihar. \n13. Assumptions and Risks  \nAs the activities will focus on institution and capacity Development, the development of social or environmental safeguard \nissues is unlikely. Some expected risks include a sudden government change in policies. However, the CDTA will mitigate \nthese risks by ensuring thorough consultations at the design stage, and retaining a flexible approach to adapt to changing \nneeds and circumstances.  \n14.

Link to country partnership strategy and/or regional cooperation strategy  \nThe CDTA aims to strengthen the capacity of the state government of Assam to implement the proposed Assam Integrated \nFlood and Riverbank Erosion Risk Management Investment Program (AIFRERMIP). The 11th Five Year Plan (2007\u20132012) \nof the Government of India accords substantially high priority to addressing the chronic flood problems constraining the \ndevelopment of the eastern region. An integrated flood risk management (IFRM) approach is promoted, comprising (i) \nsound planning framework and knowledge base, (ii) comprehensive structural and nonstructural measures, and (iii) \ninstitutional foundations. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy for India envisages enhanced \nroles for ADB in addressing the country's water sector problems including water disaster risk management, in response to \nthe Government's growing priorities as well as ADB's Strategy 2020.  \n \nProject preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) has been provided in two phases to (i) prepare the AIFRERMIP and (ii) \nprovide critical support for enhancing implementation readiness through advancing institutional reforms and establishing \nproject management systems and capacities (TA No. 7136). The AIFRERMIP aims to put into operation the participatory \nand community-based IFRM in selected existing flood embankment systems and adjacent riverine areas around urban, \nsuburban, and other strategic areas of the state, where poverty incidence is high. The CDTA will provide critical capacity \ndevelopment support to this end, following the reform framework and action plans being developed under the ongoing \nPPTA.   \n \nAnalysis of development constraints and issues relevant to the CDTA  \nEffective flood and river erosion risk management remains high on the development agenda of Assam; 90% of its \nagricultural land and urban areas are located in flood-prone areas. About 50% of these areas are covered by flood \nembankment systems with poor reliability. Despite recent reforms, such as preparation of a draft state water policy, a large \ngap remains between the present and required policy and institutional framework and capacities of the sector agencies. \nTheir approach remains largely ad hoc and structure-oriented; they lack a sufficient knowledge base and management \nsystems to respond to the highly dynamic Brahmaputra River environments in an adaptive, efficient, and sustainable \nmanner. Capacities to pursue comprehensive risk management programs in consultation with diverse stakeholders with \neffective linkages with the state\u2019s disaster management systems are also limited. The CDTA will address these issues in \nassociation with AIFRERMIP implementation. \n \nb.  Impact  \nThe overall impact of the CDTA (and the AIFRERMIP) will be the enhanced, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth in \nflood-prone areas of Assam. Risks of massive flood and erosion damage will be reduced in the project areas to support \nincreased investments in urban and rural industries, services, and agriculture.  \n \nc.  Outcome  \nThe CDTA outcome is enhanced reliability and effectiveness of state flood and riverbank erosion risk management systems. \nThey will be operated with the effective participation of local disaster management committees with sufficient representation \nof diverse local stakeholders, in particular poor and other vulnerable groups including indigenous people. The public \nagencies  designated to deliver the relevant programs  will  be held accountable,  and perform their functions to the \nsatisfaction of the concerned disaster management committees.  \n \nd.  Outputs \nIn support of operationalizing participatory IFRM under the AIFRERMIP, key CDTA outputs include (i) an autonomous \nAssam IFRM agency set up as an autonomous agency (registered under the Societies Registration Act) and made \nfunctional integrating structural and nonstructural flood and disaster risk management functions, (ii) community-based \ndisaster management committees strengthened with diverse stakeholder representation, (iii) guidelines for IFRM to define \ninstitutional mechanisms of the disaster management committees, (iv) progress in preparing state investment plans for \nIFRM integrating catchment management interventions with a river basin perspective, and (v) progress in institutional \nreforms for water resources department (WRD) in terms of organizational restructuring with strengthened capacities for data \nand knowledge base management, quality control, and asset management systems for sustainable maintenance. The TA \nwill be implemented over 24 months from April 2010 to March 2012, coinciding with the initial implementation period of the \nAIFRERMIP.  \n ", "28  Appendix 4 \n \n13. Assumptions and Risks  \nThe gap between the existing and requisite capacities to put into operation participatory and sustainable IFRM remains a \ncritical issue, comprising a policy and planning framework, transparency and accountability of mechanisms to deliver IFRM \nprograms, and sustainable maintenance financing. These are being addressed through the ongoing PPTA (phase 2), with \nimmediate actions such as  finalization of a draft state water policy,  establishment of the Assam IFRM board and \nparticipatory  disaster  management  committees,  and  preparation  of  action  plans  for  WRD  institutional  reforms  and \nsustainable maintenance mechanisms. Risk of implementation delay is being addressed by the ongoing PPTA (phase 2), \nwith early establishment of project management systems and capacities of the project organizations.  \n \nThe AIFRERMIP is classified as category A for involuntary resettlement and environment (and B for indigenous peoples). It \ninvolves acquisition of a strip of land in association with embankment renovation and shifting, and provision of riverbank \nprotection structures. Careful monitoring and response to dynamic river processes is required, although the project itself will \nnot have significant negative environmental impacts given its nature of sustaining the functions of the existing embankment \nsystems with higher reliability. \n14. Implementation Arrangements \n \na.

ADB inputs \n      \n \nd. Complementary inputs to be provided by government and/or other TA providing agencies \nProvision of counterpart staff (including working groups on institutional development, disaster management committee \ndevelopment, and technical assessments), information (including data and survey and/or study reports), office space, \nutilities, and operating costs of counterpart facilities (to be developed during TA fact-finding.) \nInternational and national consultants will be engaged to prepare the TA outputs together with the executing agency, \ncovering the expertise of water resources institutions, water disaster risk management, participatory development, and river \nengineering. ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n15. Nature and/or extent of government and beneficiary involvement in identifying or conceptualizing the assistance   \nThe Assam state government submitted an investment proposal in December 2005; this resulted in the CDTA. During the \nPPTA (phase 1), two state workshops were organized in December 2007 and June 2008, with representatives of the \nGovernment of India, the state and local governments, local research institutions including universities, and advocacy \nnongovernment  organizations  active  in  social  and  environmental  safeguards  agendas.  Given  the  highly  dynamic \nmorphological behavior of the Brahmaputra, the CDTA's approach involving improving the existing flood management \ninfrastructure in an incremental manner adapting to the natural processes (such as providing revetments along the naturally \ndeveloping bank lines as and when needed, as opposed to placing structures to control or obstruct the natural process), \nwas supported. Nongovernment organizations stressed that (i) the ownership and capacity of WRD should be strengthened \nto institutionalize the approach with stakeholder participation and accountability, which is presently lacking, (ii) careful \nenvironmental and social impact assessments should be undertaken with sufficient stakeholder consultation, and (iii) \nsufficient attention should be provided to enhance the livelihoods of the most vulnerable people who are mostly located \noutside the flood embankment systems. \n \nDuring implementation, the AIFRERMIP will strengthen and utilize the existing district, subdistrict, and village disaster \nmanagement committees. They will be empowered to take a lead role in plans and decisions on subproject and community \nimplementation  of  the  concerned  IFRM  plans,  based  on  which  the  programs  will  be  delivered  by  the  designated \norganizations under the monitoring and supervision of the disaster management committees. Special efforts will be provided \nto the enhanced participation of women, schedule tribes, and scheduled castes in the subproject areas in the subproject \ndisaster management committees. \n  ", "     Appendix 4       29\n16.

Key Development Issues to be Addressed  \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) is preparing a project to address immediate coastal protection needs by implementing \neconomically  viable  protection  works  using  environmentally  and  socially  appropriate  solutions  in  the  states  of  Goa, \nKarnataka, and Maharashtra of India. The project will address the causes and potential causes of coastal erosion and \ncoastal instability. Investments in this part will be directed mainly at coastal infrastructure that is presently causing, or with a \npotential to cause, damage to natural coastal processes. In addition, the project will support investments for natural \nprotection measures such as the development and planting of dunes, and planting of mangrove or other trees for protection \nor shelter. The project will support investments in the wider area of coastal management including water quality, navigational \nentrances, dredging, and training of river and drain mouths. It will develop capacity to meet the long-term needs of \nsustainable coastal protection and management including the development of central, state, and district capacities for \nshoreline planning, detailed planning, modeling, and design; and coordination and management of coastal infrastructure. In \naddition, the project will support initiatives to increase the participation of the private sector and communities in the planning, \ndesign, financing, implementation, and maintenance of coastal protection and management projects. Some other states \nhave shown strong interest for similar interventions for sustainable management of their coastal areas. Accordingly a new \nproject preparatory technical assistance for the next group of states is programmed for 2009.  \n \nSince  the  state  executing  agencies  of  the  proposed  Sustainable  Coastal  Protection  and  Management  Project  are \nsubstantially underresourced, and given the complex nature of project designs and extensive coordination needs with the \nthree states, further capacity development is needed for processing the Project. In addition, meeting the Department of \nEconomic Affairs' readiness criteria for project processing requires specialist assistance.  \n12. TA Description:  \na.   Link to country partnership strategy and/or regional cooperation strategy  \nThe country partnership strategy for India (2009\u20132012) envisages enhanced roles for ADB in increasing effectiveness and \nsustainability of coastal protection and management measures in coastal states. \n \nb.   Impact  \nThe impact of the CDTA will be sustainable shoreline protection and management to meet the needs of the stakeholders \nand environment. \n \nc.   Outcome \nThe key outcome of the CDTA is the preparation of an investment program to address the coastal protection and \nmanagement needs through the implementation of economically viable protection works using environmentally and socially \nappropriate solutions in the states of Goa, Karnataka, and Maharashtra.  \n \nd.  Outputs \nThe CDTA outputs comprise (i) sustainable shoreline management, (ii) an investment program for each state including \neconomically  viable  and  socially  and  environmentally  acceptable  solutions,  and  (iii)  financially  and  environmentally \nsustainable coastal zone management mechanisms. Key activities include (i) supporting finalization of project designs and \ninterventions, (ii) following up with states and executing agencies on outstanding issues and implementation arrangements \nfor the project, (iii) conducting environmental assessment and stakeholder consultations, and (iv) conducting a study tour of \nstate officials to familiarize them with coastal protection measures proposed by the project. The CDTA will focus on \nsupporting implementation of ADB's operation and management of interventions in coastal protection and management. \nThe CDTA will be implemented over 9 months from July 2009 to March 2010.  \n13. Assumptions and Risks  \nThe CDTA involves some issues and risks including implementation delays and organizations that may not be effective in \nimplementing sustainable coastal protection measures. Measures will be taken to minimize such risks. \n \n ", "32  Appendix 4 \n \n14. Implementation Arrangements \n \na.

Link to country partnership strategy and/or regional cooperation strategy  \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been providing assistance to India to develop roads, one of the key infrastructure \nsubsectors for inclusive economic growth. Since 2003, it has focused assistance on the relatively poor and weak capacity \nstates to support the Government in its efforts to reduce interstate disparities. The state of Jharkhand is one of the poor \nstates in terms of per capita gross state domestic product, poverty incidence, and other socioeconomic indicators. As the \nfirst ADB assistance to the state's infrastructure development, an investment project, the Jharkhand State Roads Project \n(JSRP), is currently being prepared for ADB processing in 2009. The Road Construction Department (RCD) of the \nJharkhand government is the executing agency for the JSRP. The CDTA will be attached to the JSRP, and provide \nassistance in improving efficiency of the state's road sector, focusing on institutional strengthening of RCD. This is in line \nwith  the  ADB  strategy  for  India's  state  road  sector,  under  which  ADB  provides  technical  assistance  for  capacity \nDevelopment along with financial assistance to improve the state road network.  \n \nAnalysis of development constraints and issues relevant to the proposed TA  \nWhile substantial capacity enhancement measures have been taken within RCD in preparation for the JSRP, further \ncapacity Development is necessary for RCD to be able to deliver the JSRP in an efficient and timely manner, and to \nmaintain the created asset in a sustainable manner. \n \nb.   Impact \nThe JSRP will be delivered in a timely manner. Further the overall state road network in Jharkhand will be maintained and \nimproved by RCD in a more effective manner, resulting in time and cost savings for road transport in the state. This will, in \nturn, facilitate economic growth and social development in the state.  \n \nc.   Outcome  \nAt CDTA completion, RCD is expected to have improved capacity in project management and will be ready to take full \nresponsibility for maintaining the road asset to be created at the end of the JSRP in a sustainable manner. Further RCD will \nbe ready to replicate the good practices introduced for the JSRP in other areas of its operation. \n \nd.   Outputs \nIn the early part of JSRP implementation, the CDTA will assist RCD in (i) improving its business procedure for project \nmanagement and asset management; (ii) adopting best practices and tools for project planning, design, road asset \nmanagement, and road safety; and (iii) enhancing its staff's skills through dedicated, structured training in these aspects. \nThe CDTA will assist RCD in determining the types and specifications of the equipment and facilities to be procured under \nthe JSRP for strengthening RCD's quality assurance function. \n13. Assumptions and Risks  \nWhile the current RCD management is keen to introduce various reforms, non managerial RCD staff could resist the new \nbusiness procedures and redefinition of RCD's roles in improving and maintaining roads. \n14. Implementation Arrangements \n \na. Proposed executing and implementing agencies: Road Construction Department, State Government of Jharkhand       \n \nb.

A project \nimplementation cell created within RCD is being staffed with qualified officials.  \n \nc. ADB inputs \n      \n \nd. Complementary inputs to be provided by government and/or other TA providing agencies \n \nADB will engage the consultants in accordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). The project implementation cell will be fully staffed and functioning by the start of the CDTA; its staff will serve as \ncounterpart staff for the CDTA. RCD will provide office accommodation and make reports and other documents related to \nJSRP preparation and implementation available to the CDTA consultants.  \n ", "     Appendix 4       35\n15. Nature and/or extent of government and beneficiary involvement in identifying or conceptualizing the assistance   \n \nDuring the preceding PPTA, RCD staff were consulted on the scope of the CDTA. During the loan fact-finding mission for \nthe JSRP in July\u2013August 2008 and a follow-up consultation mission in November 2008, further consultation was carried out \nwith RCD to develop the CDTA concept and scope.  \n  \n16.

Link to country partnership strategy and/or regional cooperation strategy       \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) provides support to India in road sector development as a core infrastructure operation \nfor inclusive economic growth. Since 2003, it has focused on the relatively poorer and weak capacity states to support the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to reduce interstate disparities. The state of Madhya Pradesh is one of the poorest states in India and \nthe first state to receive ADB\u2019s assistance to India\u2019s state roads (2002). Based on the substantial development of the reform \nand physical investment in roads under ADB assistance, the state government of Madhya Pradesh (SGMP) has proposed ", "     Appendix 4       37\nto implement the third generation of ADB assistance for state road development. PPTA is required to ensure full compliance \nwith ADB safeguard requirements and quality assessment in key areas such as project economics and results monitoring. \n \nb.  Impact  \nThe resulting project will enhance road transport efficiency and safety, with increased traffic growth rates and reduced travel \ntime on project roads. \n \nc.  Outcome \nAgreed design of the resulting project. \n \nd.  Outputs         \nThe PPTA will assist the executing agency in preparing the project to fully comply with ADB requirements and to enhance \noverall  implementation  readiness,  including  (i)  feasibility  studies  (assessment  of  project  economics  and  financial \nsustainability); (ii) environmental studies; (iii) social impact assessments; (iv) resettlement impact studies and preparation of \nresettlement  plans,  including  detailed  action  plan  for  establishing  resettlement  and  rehabilitation;  (v)  implementation \narrangements; (vi) review and finalization of detailed project reports, bidding documents for civil works, and RFP for \nconsultant recruitment; and (vii) assessment of need for institutional strengthening and capacity development of Madhya \nPradesh Roads Development Corporation and Public Works Department. \n \nClose coordination with the executing agency, its consultants, and PPTA consultants, and consultation with affected people \nwill be undertaken. \n9.  Assumptions and Risks  \nNo major social and environmental issues are envisaged as all the proposed roads are to improve existing roads. The \nexecuting agency has experience managing safeguard activities in line with ADB safeguard requirements. The executing \nagency will engage additional consultants to support implementation of safeguard aspects. Frameworks for environmental \nassessment and review, resettlement, and indigenous peoples will be prepared in line with government and ADB policies \nand procedures. Capacity enhancement needs will be reflected in these frameworks. \n10. Implementation Arrangements \na.

Due to the abundance of perennial rivers, \nHimachal sells hydroelectricity to other states such as Delhi, Punjab, and Rajasthan. The economy of the state is highly \ndependent on three revenue sources: hydroelectric power, tourism, and agriculture. About 45% of the gross state domestic \nproduct is from agriculture, which 93% of the population depends upon. \n \nHeavy dependence on agriculture may make the economy  of Himachal Pradesh vulnerable to sudden changes in \nagricultural commodity prices; thus it needs to gradually diversify its income sources. Nevertheless, Himachal Pradesh is \nfacing a number of constraints in industrial development, i.e., lack of dependable transport and poor accessibility. Other \nproblems are poor mineral resources, non availability of infrastructure and communication facilities, shortage of capital, and \nlack of modern skills. The ample availability of electricity is the state\u2019s strength. \n \nAs the tourism industry grows, the lack of infrastructure becomes a serious problem. The increasing numbers of tourists are \nexceeding the capacity of urban infrastructure in the major cities of Himachal Pradesh. Vertical expansion of building as a \nresult of limited availability of flat land, such as high-rise hotels and shops, increase the population density. This places a \nheavy strain on existing urban infrastructure. The government of Himachal Pradesh has put much effort into investing in \nurban infrastructure in its major urban cities. For example, Shimla city is covered under the Jawaharlal Nehru National \nUrban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) to address inadequate sewerage provision, solid waste management, and traffic \ncongestion. The government of Himachal Pradesh claims, however, that the JNNURM financial resources are too limited to \nimprove urban services in the state\u2019s major cities. \n \n8.  TA Description \na.  Link to country partnership strategy and/or regional cooperation strategy       \nIndia\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan (FYP) 2007\u20132012 identifies 27 national targets, covering both economic and social goals. They \ninclude (i) ensuring clean drinking water is available to all by 2009, by the end of the 11th FYP; and (ii) treating all urban \nwastewater by 2011/12 to clean river water. Also, the FYP recognizes infrastructure bottlenecks and lack of long-term funds \nfor infrastructure investment as binding constraints for achieving the goals. The Plan calls for public sector investment in \nmeeting infrastructure requirements where private participation is unlikely to be forthcoming. \n \nThe country partnership and strategy is designed to support the Government of India\u2019s efforts to address the binding \nconstraints in the 11th FYP through four strategic pillars (support for inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth, \ncatalyzing investment through the use of innovative business and financing solutions, strengthening results orientation and \nemphasizing knowledge solutions, and support for regional cooperation. One of the pillars emphasizes the continuation of \nADB assistance to infrastructure development in various sectors, including urban. \n \nThe outputs of the PPTA will help the government of Himachal Pradesh determine the investment scope, based on which a \nsubsequent PPTA with bridging assistance will be separately proposed. The PPTA will assess \n(i)  master plans of the major cities of Himachal Pradesh, and actual land use and development; \n(ii)  the regulatory mechanism for urban development; \n(iii)  the existing long-term investment plan, if any, and revise and/or develop a new plan in accordance with the master \nplan; and \n(iv)  the size of works that can be financed by the regular capital investment budget of state agencies and urban local \nbodies (ULB). \n \nb.  Impact  \nThe government of Himachal Pradesh will have a clear investment strategy for improving urban service delivery to promote \ninclusive growth. \n \nc.  Outcome \nA scope of potential urban development projects requiring a large financial resource have been developed. \n \nd.  Outputs \n(i)  Modified master plans for the major cities of Himachal Pradesh \n(ii)  Recommendations for reforms of the regulatory mechanism for land use and development \n(iii) New and/or revised 10-year investment plan for water supply, sewerage, and solid waste management following the \nmodified mater plans, together with 5-year project pipelines \n(iv) A clear idea of what size of works can be left with the state government agencies and ULB to finance by themselves \n(v)  A clear idea of which agencies are legally and technically suitable for implementing investment projects ", "     Appendix 4       41\n9.  Assumptions and Risks  \nThe government of Himachal Pradesh has not yet requested ADB financial assistance due to the lack of a clear investment \nplan and project proposals. The TA may not result in an immediate request for a loan from the government of Himachal \nPradesh. \n \nThe executing agency has little experience in preparing aid-funded projects. Therefore, the executing agency may have a \ndifferent understanding of ADB\u2019s lending policy, safeguards policy, and procurement and consultant recruitment guidelines. \nThis may result in delay in production of the outputs. \n10.

Key Development Issues to be Addressed  \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided TA for the first 3 years of implementation of the Jawaharlal Nehru National \nUrban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), which is likely to be completed in October 2009. The Government of India appreciated \nthis TA support, and requested continued TA support for the remaining period of JNNURM implementation (up to March \n2012).  \n \nGrowing Significance of Urban Development. The 11th Five Year Plan of India (2007\u20132012) gives high priority to urban \ndevelopment and notes that \"Indian cities will be the locus and engine of economic growth over the next two decades, and \nthe realization of an ambitious goal of 9-10% growth in GDP depends fundamentally on making Indian cities much more \nlivable, inclusive, bankable, and competitive.\" The plan identifies spatial disparities in urban infrastructure across the cities \nas one of the major constraints to India's urbanization and economic growth. The JNNURM is the flagship government \nprogram to accelerate urban infrastructure development as well as improve urban governance. The Government of India, \nstate governments, and JNNURM cities have committed substantial funds under the ongoing JNNURM to improve urban \ninfrastructure.  \n \nGaps in Urban Infrastructure. Currently, the provision of urban infrastructure and services in India is characterized by \nsevere deficiencies. While 90% of the urban population has access to water supply, only 74% of the country\u2019s population \nhave access to piped water. The amount and quality of piped water is poor, with water available only for a few hours per \nday. Only 62% of the urban population has access to toilets either connected to sewers, septic tanks, or latrines, which are \nnot properly maintained, leading to health and environmental problems. About 50% of solid waste generated is not \ncollected. Urban roads and transport systems are inadequate making travel within cities time-consuming and inefficient. In \nabsence of reliable rapid transport systems, commuters depend on private transportation. Urban roads are rundown and/or \noverwhelmed  by  increasing  vehicular  traffic.  Roads  are  clogged  during  rush  hour,  leading  to  lost  productivity  and \nenvironmental pollution. India needs huge investments to upgrade its urban infrastructure to improve water and sewerage \nservices, solid waste management, mass transportation systems, among others.  \n \nScaling Up Investments. The JNNURM is a timely initiative and, given the history of urban infrastructure development in \nIndia, the scale of JNNURM intervention is impressive. However, given the speed of urbanization, the pent-up demand for \nurban infrastructure, and investments in urban infrastructure required to sustain high economic growth, much greater \nsustained urban infrastructure investments are required in the future. Hence, TA support for the JNNURM is required not \nonly to consolidate the first phase TA support, but also to assist MOUD in increasing urban infrastructure investments and \nsupport the reform agenda for enabling governance, fiscal, and institutional changes that will truly transform Indian cities \ninto globally competitive, vibrant, environmentally sustainable, and inclusive cities. While finances are certainly a constraint, \nstate and city institutional capacity to conceive, design, procure, and execute complex urban projects and sustainable \nmechanisms to operate and maintain the assets being created, is another. Most of the states and cities that are lagging in \nJNNURM implementation are those whose state and city urban development departments lack agencies with engineering \ncapacity to prepare detailed project reports and procure and monitor civil works effectively. TA is required to support states \nthat are falling behind with JNNURM implementation.  \n \nInstitutionalization of Capacities for Long-Term Development. Urbanization will become more intense. In addition to \nmeeting the urban infrastructure gaps that continue to be massive, the momentum of urban development has to shift from \nreactive to proactive. The current reactive approach is responding to unsystematic urbanization by largely meeting urban \nbasic service needs of the burgeoning urban population. In a proactive approach, urbanization is planned and the \nurbanization process is utilized to provide stimulus for sustained economic growth by strategic urban investments. To \nachieve this transformational shift from being reactive to proactive, the institutional and financial framework of urban \ndevelopment will need a systematic overhaul. Given these massive challenges, national and state capacity developed \nthrough the JNNURM must be maintained, i.e., complex multidisciplinary capacities (engineering, procurement, financial \nmanagement,  urban  planning,  municipal  finance,  and  environmental  sustainability)  relating  to  urban  infrastructure \ndevelopment and urban reforms under a sustainable institutional framework.  \n \n12. TA Description  \na.   Link to country partnership strategy and/or regional cooperation strategy  \nADB's  country  strategy  for  India  gives  high  priority  to  urban  development,  and  supports  the  Government's  urban \ndevelopment  agenda  with  dual  objectives  of  improving  the  quality  of  life  of  urban  residents,  and  enhancing  the \ncompetitiveness of Indian cities to attract investment in a globalizing world. The key outcome of ADB\u2019s urban sector \nassistance comprises contributions to the 11th Five Year Plan\u2019s targets for (i) increasing access of the urban population to \nwater supply and sanitation, (ii) enhancing urban accessibility and mobility, and (iii) improving the environment and public \nhealth for the urban population. The rationale for continuing ADB support to the JNNURM is as follows: Urban infrastructure \n ", "46  Appendix 4 \n \ndevelopment on a scale to meet the burgeoning needs of Indian cities has been undermined for decades. The JNNURM is \nthe first large-scale national program to address neglected gaps in urban infrastructure, and address the current demands \nfor infrastructure. However, executing the JNNURM in an institutional context accustomed to small scales of urban \ninvestments and an environment of constrained policy, capacity, and governance has been a difficult task. The first phase of \nADB assistance through TA helped MOUD set up systems, procedures, and monitoring of the JNNURM. Additional \nassistance is now needed to consolidate the gains, institutionalize the systems in a sustainable manner, and support states \nlagging in implementation. The CDTA is in line with ADB\u2019s country strategy for urban infrastructure development and is \nincluded in the country operations and business plan 2009\u20132010. The CDTA will support initiatives to institutionalize \ncapacities developed during the current phase of JNNURM implementation, and strengthen such institutionalized national, \nstate, and city urban development capacities.  \n \nb.   Impact  \nImproved urban infrastructure and JNNURM-led reforms lead to higher quality urban basic services, and faster and \nsustained economic growth in India. \n \nc.   Outcome  \nBy the end of the 11th Five Year Plan of India (2012), the targeted investments in urban infrastructure and enabling \ninstitutional reforms envisaged by the JNNURM are achieved. \n \nd.

Assumptions and Risks  \nEstablishing sustainable national, state, and city institutions to retain capacity built during the current phase of the JNNURM \nis a major issue, i.e., for undertaking long-term urban development of Indian cities. The TA will address this to some extent \nby supporting national institution building, and working with five lagging states. A prolonged global economic downturn could \nslow the Government's efforts to increase urban infrastructure investments. Resistance to fiscal devolution and lack of \ncommitment to strong urban local bodies is a risk for JNNURM reforms. The lack of good quality consultants could be \nanother risk for effective implementation of the CDTA. \n14. Implementation Arrangements \n \na.

The core team will comprise an urban infrastructure \nfinance expert (team leader, 25 person-months); urban infrastructure and water supply, sewerage, and drainage expert \n(deputy  team  leader,  25  person-months);  procurement  expert  (25  person-months);  monitoring  and  evaluation  and \ninformation technology expert (25 person-months); urban infrastructure and urban transport expert (18 person-months); \nsolid  waste  management  expert  (18  person-months);  economist  and  financial  analysis  expert  (12  person-months); \nenvironmental safeguard expert (12 person-months); and social safeguard and social development expert (10 person-\nmonths).   \n \nIn addition, the consultant firm will provide eight resident urban infrastructure and procurement experts (140 person-months) \nwho  will  be  deployed  in  a  flexible  manner  at  selected  state  headquarters  to  provide  support  for  JNNURM  state \nimplementation. The overall function of the consultant firm is to provide support to MOUD in the overall management of the \nprogram with special focus on strategy, systems, processes, institution building, monitoring, and evaluation to ensure high \nquality and time-bound execution of infrastructure projects financed by the JNNURM with special focus on lagging states. \nThe consultant firm will help strengthen systems and processes for monitoring the quality of infrastructure; and provide, \nwhere necessary, support for developing feasibility reports, detailed designs, procurement, hiring of independent quality \nassurance firms, and training for client state and cities. \n \nThe Independent consultants will be project management and institutional development experts hired for 100 person-\nmonths. ADB will engage consulting firms and individual consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). QCBS with simplified technical proposals will be used to select the \nconsultant firm. The quality/cost ratio to be used for the QCBS will be 80:20. All equipment purchased under the CDTA will \nbe handed over to MOUD after TA completion. To facilitate implementation, the CDTA will use an advance payment facility \nfor workshops and surveys. The amount of the advance and its liquidation will be arranged in line with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2008).  \n \nd. Complementary inputs to be provided by Government and/or other TA providing agencies \nMOUD, the Executing Agency, will be responsible for overall coordination of all CDTA activities. The JNNURM mission \ndirector, in MOUD, will be the project director of the CDTA and the consultants will directly report to the mission director. \nThe Government will appoint counterpart staff to be part of the JNNURM project cell, who will work directly with the CDTA \nconsultants. Mobilizing an adequate number of skilled counterpart staff from the market on a contractual basis as well as \nobtaining staff on deputation from other agencies will be important for CDTA success. During CDTA implementation, close \ncoordinated work between the TA team and counterpart staff will help transfer skills and processes from the consultants to \nthe counterpart staff, and in the process help build sustainable capacity. A steering committee chaired by the MOUD \nsecretary will review CDTA performance quarterly, and provide overall stewardship for enhancing CDTA effectiveness.

All the coastal states and union territories are to some extent affected by \ncoastal erosion. About 26% of the mainland coastline faces serious erosion problems; much is actively retreating. Many of \nthe coastal protection strategies employed have been ineffective as coastal properties and investments remain threatened \nby erosion, particularly during monsoon seasons. Furthermore, the extensive use of rock protection structures has \ncontributed to degradation of beaches and the social environment of the coastal zone. Sea level rise in the Indian \nsubcontinent is projected to be between 15 and 38 centimeters by the middle of the century. The rise in sea level and the \nlikely increased frequency and intensity of storms will exacerbate the erosion problem.  \n \n \n ", "50  Appendix 4 \n \n8.  TA Description: \na.  Link to country partnership strategy and/or regional cooperation strategy       \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) CPS for India (2009-2012) envisages an enhanced role for ADB in increasing \neffectiveness and sustainability of coastal protection and management measures in coastal states.  \n \nb.  Impact  \nThe impact of the PPTA and the resulting project is the long-term sustainability and economic development of the shoreline \nfor the benefit of coastal communities in selected states.  \n \nc.  Outcome \nThe outcome will be an ADB project design that includes preparation of an investment program for ADB financing under a \npossible multitranche financing facility (MFF) modality that includes (i) infrastructure, (ii) institutional strengthening, and \n(iii) capacity development. \n \nd.  Outputs         \nThe PPTA will address the due diligences requirements for an MFF program and support investment preparation for \nsubprojects to be financed through the first tranche of the MFF, including structural and nonstructural costal protection and \nmanagement interventions. \n \nThe first component of the PPTA will focus on addressing the due diligence of MFF processing requirements. The following \noutputs will be delivered: (i) a refined policy framework, (ii) a sector road map, (iii) a medium-term investment program, (iv) a \nprogram  financing  plan,  (v)  a  program  design  and  monitoring  framework,  (vi)  necessary  safeguard  frameworks \n(environment, resettlement, and social) and institutional and governance frameworks. Importantly, the PPTA will provide \nrecommendations to establish the program management facility (PMF), which will assist with implementing the investment \nprogram, and activities under the first financing tranche (including safeguards, institutional, technical) as well as the \npreparation of physical and nonphysical investments for inclusion under the subsequent MFF tranches. The PPTA will \nprepare bidding documents for the PMF consultants and equipment procurement to ensure quick start-up of program \nimplementation.  \n \nThe second component of the PPTA will comprise preparation of the program first tranche investment and due diligence \nrequirements. The outputs will include (i) subproject selection criteria and a list of selected subprojects; (ii) completed \nsubproject feasibility and detail design studies including technical, economic, financial, legal, social, and environmental due \ndiligence; (iii) recommendations for improving coastal zone management mechanisms; (iv) a first tranche investment plan, \ndesign and monitoring framework, implementation plan, and tender documents for subproject construction works.  \n9.  Assumptions and Risks       \nThe PPTA involves some issues and risks including implementation delays, pressure to develop inappropriate solutions, \nand ineffective organizations to implement sustainable coastal protection measures. Lack of needed institutional changes to \nensure the long term sustainability of the project initiatives is a major risk. Measures will be taken to minimize these. Given \nthe pressure to continue the program of rock-wall construction, change to soft and environmentally appropriate options may \nnot always be perceived as acceptable. A key issue is the sustainability of project interventions, which will require \nresources, capacities, and organizations for management and maintenance of the completed works. The sustainability of \nthe project will also require the initiation of a number of institutional reforms. \n10. Implementation Arrangements \n \na.

Link to country partnership strategy and/or regional cooperation strategy       \n        Development of the power subsector is an important plank of ADB's country partnership strategy for India. \n \nDuring the 11th Five Year Plan (2008\u20132012), the Government of India proposes to increase installed generation capacity \nfrom about 140,571 megawatts (MW) (as of 31 December 2007) to 209,440 MW. Financing this capacity expansion of \n78,577 MW and the associated transmission and distribution system is a major challenge for the power subsector. The \nGovernment also aims to reduce aggregate technical and commercial losses from 40% to 15% by 2012. The PPTA will \nreview possible areas and projects for energy efficiency improvement in generation, transmission, and distribution in \nUttarakhand by adopting, for example, new generation technology, high-efficiency transmission network development, and ", "     Appendix 4       53\ndemand-side management in distribution. The PPTA will review possible projects in renewable energy for off-grid areas, \nsuch as mini-hydro and watermills, hybrid solar, and wind generation, to help achieve the Government\u2019s \u201cPower for All by \n2012\u201d initiative targets.  \n \nb.  Impact  \nThe anticipated impact of the PPTA (and outcome of the ensuing projects) is sustained inclusive economic growth by \nimproving efficiency and increasing capacity in Uttarakhand\u2019s energy sector. A more efficient and effective sector will relieve \nor at least lessen the burden of the power subsector on the state budget, and will facilitate economic development by \nremoving impediments to growth and allocating scarce public resources away from the power industry. \n \nc.  Outcome \nThe outcome of the PPTA is to develop a least-cost project design and comprehensive feasibility studies agreed between \nthe Government and ADB, for improving energy efficiencies in generation, transmission, and distribution, along with \nadditional renewable energy generation development schemes using such approaches as watermills, solar, wind, and \nbiomass.  The  PPTA  will  facilitate  identification  of  various  options  and  investment  needs  to  achieve  environmental \nsustainability in the energy sector. \n \nd.  Outputs         \nThe PPTA will have three principal outputs: (i) Uttarakhand energy efficiency master plan, (ii) a status report on various \noptions (including ways and means) and investment needs to achieve environmental sustainability in the energy sector, and \n(iii) a draft strategy, and financing mechanism for identified investment options to become commercially viable activities. The \nfinancing mechanism for selected options will include potential for private sector participation and various other innovative \nfinancing arrangements. These outputs will ensure possible loan and grant projects with cost estimates; technical, financial, \neconomic, and socioeconomic analyses; and social and environmental assessments.  \n9.  Assumptions and Risks       \nSince  the  review  areas  are  scattered,  involving  generation,  transmission,  distribution,  and  renewable  energy,  good \ncoordination with all stakeholders, such the national and state governments, executing and implementing agencies, other \ndevelopment partners, and local communities, is required to create the Uttarakhand energy efficiency master plan and other \ndocuments, which should be comprehensive and harmonized with all reviewed areas.  \n \nVarious tough issues, such as the power shortage in urban areas, demand assessment in rural and off-grid areas, power \nprices and cost recovery, willingness to pay, affordability, subsidization of consumption, regulation, and conflict in use, also \nneed to be covered to understand sustainability of the sector.        \n \nSimilar to other ongoing ADB projects, such an energy efficiency project based upon rural electrification, the project may be \ncategorized as \"B\" because it is expected to minimize or mitigate any negative environmental impacts and has positive \nsocial and environmental impacts.    \n ", "54  Appendix 4 \n \n10. Implementation Arrangements \na.  Proposed executing and implementing agencies      \nThe Uttarakhand Energy Department (UED) will be the Executing Agency for all PPTA components. The four implementing \nagencies  are  (i)  Uttarakhand  Power  Corporation  Limited  for  distribution-related  components  and  any  on-grid  rural \nelectrification;  (ii)  Uttarakhand  renewable  energy  development  agency  (UREDA)  for  renewable  energy  development \nincluding water mills, biomass, off-grid solar rural and/or wind power generation plants; (iii) Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam \nLtd. for hydropower generation areas; and (iv) Power Transmission Corporation of Uttarakhand Ltd. for transmission areas. \nThe Project Management Office (PMO) of UED for ADB projects will set up a steering committee to coordinate with the \nimplementing agencies and oversee PPTA implementation. The PMO will establish the relevant project team for each PPTA \ncomponent to help the consultants liaise with government ministries and agencies, local authorities, and project area \nresidents; and obtain data and documentation from them. UED will provide sufficient office space, furniture, and support \nfacilities to the PPTA consultants on time.  \n \nb.

ADB inputs \n      \n \nd.  Complementary inputs to be provided by Government and/or other TA providing agencies \nThe PPTA will require 100 person-months of consulting services (40 international and 60 national). The consultant team will \ninclude eight areas of expertise: (i) power sector management, (ii) renewable energy, (iii) urban\u2013rural power distribution, \n(iv) hydropower and transmission, (v) economic analysis and evaluation, (vi) financial analysis and management, (vii) social \nsafeguard development, and (viii) environmental assessment and management.  \n \nThe executing and implementing agencies will establish the counterpart project team and appoint its manager for each \nPPTA component to help the consultants liaise with other government ministries and agencies, local authorities, and people \nin the project areas, and obtain data and documentation from them. UED will provide sufficient office space, furniture, and \nsupport facilities to the PPTA consultants on time.  \n11. Nature and/or extent of government and beneficiary involvement in identifying or conceptualizing the assistance   \nAll  the  power  sector  agencies  concerned  and  key  development  partners  in  Uttarakhand  were  consulted  during \nconceptualization of this assistance program.

Department, Division: SARD, SAFM \n11. Key Development Issues to be Addressed:  \nOrissa is India\u2019s 9th largest state by area (share of 4.74%) and 11th largest by population (share of 3.58%). However, it \nranks 14th according to gross state domestic product (GSDP) (2005/06) among the 17 nonspecial category states. Though \nits GSDP has almost doubled during the last 5 years, from Rs434.9 billion in 2001/02 to Rs911.5 billion in 2006/07, its share \nof India\u2019s gross domestic product has increased only marginally from 2.24% to 2.40% from 2001/02 to 2006/07. Annual per \ncapita income of the state is 5th lowest in the country at Rs17,610 compared to the all India average of Rs25,956 for \n2005/06. Among the 15 major states of India, Orissa\u2019s human development index was the 5th lowest in 1981, 4th lowest in \n1991, and again the 5th lowest in 2001, even though the absolute value of the index rose between 1981 and 2001 by 51.3%, \nalbeit from a rather low level (Orissa Human Development Report 2004). \n \nOrissa embarked on fiscal reform during the past decade. During 1999\u20132001, the state signed a memorandum of \nunderstanding with the Government of India to implement an agreed set of reform measures. The state enacted the Fiscal \nResponsibility Legislation in 2005 and formulated a medium-term fiscal plan with monitorable fiscal targets. Orissa has \nundertaken significant reform to enhance revenue, reform expenditure management, and rationalize staffing. Some of the \nmajor reform initiatives are (i) introduction of value-added tax in 2005; rationalization of tax rates, stamp duty, and \nregistration fees; and computerization of commercial taxes; (ii) introduction of a defined contributory pension scheme and \nfast-track  mechanism  for  completion  of  infrastructure  projects,  as  well  as  treasury  computerization  through  on-line \nverification of budgetary allocation; (iii) introduction of a voluntary retirement scheme for state government employees, \nrestrictions on new recruitment, and staff rationalization through efficient human resources utilization.   \n \nThe state government is now considering reform of public sector enterprises (PSEs) (such as closure, privatization, and \nrestructuring of loss-making PSEs). Inadequate provision of economic and social infrastructure continues to hamper state \ndevelopment, and Orissa continues to be a poor state with considerable scope for development. The overall literacy rate in \nOrissa was 63% in 2001, which ranks 24th among the 35 states and union territories. Infant mortality continues to be highest \nin Orissa among all the states. Lack of access to safe drinking water, and inadequate nutrition and health care services are \nmajor causes of the state\u2019s high infant mortality rate. \n \nWeak economic and social infrastructure, slow industrial development, high proportion of tribal population, high cost of \nservice delivery, and inadequate investment are some of the key issues indicating a need for continuing reforms in the state. \nIn the presence of widespread poverty and urgent need for economic and social infrastructure, efficient public resource \nmanagement reform (PRMR) becomes imperative.  \n \n12. TA Description:  \na.  Link to country partnership strategy and/or regional cooperation strategy  \n      \nb.   Impact  \nThe impact of the PATA will be improved development management in Orissa by designing a policy matrix for PRMR to \nhelp achieve improved financial flexibility for the state government. This will allow it to actively promote social and physical \ninfrastructure development and improve economic growth performance. \n \nc.  Outcome  \nThe outcomes of the PATA will include an agreed design of a program loan with a policy matrix governing areas of revenue \nadministration, expenditure management, debt management, PSE reform, as well as capacity Development to successfully \nimplement the policy matrix. \n \nd.   Outputs \nKey activities of the PATA include (i) developing revenue augmentation and facilitating administration for tax and nontax \nrevenues; (ii) developing procedures for introducing output-based budgeting, including financial indicators for monitoring; \n(iii) developing mechanisms for capturing data and providing expenditure estimates for the operation and maintenance of \nasset-creating projects in the budget; (iv) undertaking a feasibility study and preparing an action plan for creating physical \nasset registers for state government assets, in preparation for moving to accrual-based accounting; (v) developing efficient \ndebt management and guarantees including maintenance of a debt data system and regular reporting mechanism; \n(vi) studying the functioning of 29 PSEs currently in operation and providing categorization of enterprises according to \nwhether they should be restructured or closed (for this analysis, Orissa PSE reform program by Department for International \nDevelopment (United Kingdom) will be used as a basis); and (vii) identifying emerging skill demands in the job market in \nOrissa with an emphasis on the labor market and rising industries in Orissa. \n \nThe major outputs of the PATA include (i) an agreed design on a policy matrix, strategy, and action plans, along with an \nestimation of appropriate adjustment costs, as part of the overall fiscal consolidation program of Orissa PRMR; (ii) a holistic \nanalysis of the operating PSEs and recommendation for reform; (iii) examination of relevant international and national best \n ", "58  Appendix 4 \n \npractices in designing desirable revenue augmentation, expenditure and debt management, as well as state-owned \nenterprise  reform;  and  (iv)  capacity  development  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  to  improve  program \nmanagement and implementation with resulting impact on timely and effective program implementation.  \n13. Assumptions and Risks \nPotential issues include the following: (i) Revenue administration: Orissa has made decent progress in revenue reforms such \nas  introduction  of  value-added  tax  in  2005;  rationalization  of  tax  rates,  stamp  duty  and  registration  fees;  checking \nundervaluation of property; computerization of commercial taxes; and on-line registration and e-filing of tax returns. \nHowever, potential for improvement remains for revenue collection and administration in terms of low tax base and limited \nprogress in public resource management. (ii) Expenditure management: Currently overall PRMR is lacking. The only \ndepartment with a medium-term expenditure framework is in the health sector. The state government has not yet developed \na proper output-based budget. Reform will be needed for the treasury computerization system with the provision of \nmanagement information system (MIS) facilities and a bank interface with the treasury system. (iii) Debt management: \nOrissa's debt to GSDP ratio of 40% is 6th highest among the nonspecial category states and is high compared with the debt \nto GSDP ratio of 28% for all states. To curb growing interest payment obligations, the state needs to continue swapping and \nbuying back high-cost debt, and access low-cost and concessional borrowings from external funding agencies through the \nnational Government, (iv) PSE reform: The state government's investments in PSEs and devolution of guarantees by \ngovernment on debts raised by the PSEs have been a major fiscal drain on the state finances. Thus, PSE reform becomes \nvery important for the state to enable development, utilization of resources, and facilitate private sector investments into \nsectors exclusively reserved for or dominated by the public sector.  \n \nSome minor risks involve the nonsustainability of current reform measures, because, for example, of insufficient capacity in \nspecific implementing government agencies. However, these risks can be mitigated by continued policy dialogue with the \nstate government and other stakeholders, including business associations; as well as specific technical assistance and \ncapacity development support. \n14. Implementation Arrangements \na. Proposed executing and/or implementing agency  \nThe Finance Department of the state of Orissa will be the Executing Agency for the PATA. It will provide office space, \nfurniture, equipment, and counterpart staff for TA consultants, who will receive operations advice and guidance from the \nproject director of the Finance Department. The state government will set up a steering committee, cochaired by the \ncommissioner and Finance Department secretary, with the project director acting as the committee secretary. \n \nb.

Key Development Issues to be Addressed  \nThe Government of India\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan aims for \u201cfaster and more inclusive growth,\u201d citing the issue of inequitable \nshare of growth, which is seen as increasing disparities among states, and regions within states; between urban and rural \nareas; and between various sections of the community. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) supports faster and more \ninclusive growth mainly focusing on infrastructure development: transport, energy, and urban in weaker states during 2008\u2013\n2010. \n \nMadhya Pradesh was formed in 1956 by merging three states. It inherited its feudal character, large socially and \neconomically disadvantaged population, and poor social and physical infrastructure from the original three states. It is one of \nthe five major states of India known for being worse off than the rest of the country in terms of many development indicators. \nTherefore, investment in urban infrastructure in Madhya Pradesh will contribute to minimizing increasing disparities among \nstates. \n \n8.  TA Description \na.  Link to country partnership strategy and/or regional cooperation strategy  \nADB\u2019s financial assistance for investment in urban infrastructure in Madhya Pradesh started in 2003. The Urban Water \nSupply and Environmental Improvement in Madhya Pradesh Project (the Project) invested in water supply, sewerage, and \nsolid waste management in the four major cities. The Urban Administration and Development Department of the state \ngovernment of Madhya Pradesh (SGMP) was the executing agency. A supplementary loan was provided in 2008, to \nrecuperate the impact of the steep rupee appreciation against the dollar in 2007 and 2008. The Project is expected to be \ncompleted in 2011. \n \nADB\u2019s financial assistance has two outcomes: (i) improved urban infrastructure is being developed on a large scale in the \nfour cities; and (ii) the weak Project Management Unit (PMU) of the executing agency was transformed into a strong PMU \nthrough a major business process reengineering, which resulted in quick decision making, reliable costing, and attainment of \npublic confidence. The executing agency is now capable of implementing a large-scale project, i.e., the PMU can supervise \nconsultants, float contracts for tenders, attract bidders, supervise the contractors, and make immediate payments to \ncontractors. \n \nThe PMU is now ready to expand its activities to other cities of Madhya Pradesh. This requires (i) development of projects in \nother cities, (ii) preparation of detailed engineering design, and (iii) identification of a financing source for investment. \n \nb.

Key Development Issues to be Addressed  \nThe urban population in India currently comprises 28% of the total population and is expanding at a rapid pace in \nconjunction with accelerating economic growth. Urban areas have, in turn, been the key drivers of economic growth, \ncontributing to around 50%\u201360% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. Acknowledging that urban India is the country's \nengine for growth, the Government recently strived to give importance to the urban sector and improve urban infrastructure \nand services through institutional and financial interventions based on the 74th Constitution Amendment Act corroborated \nwith two consecutive five-year plans from FY2002 to FY2011. \n \nRajasthan is India's largest state with a total area of 0.35 million square kilometers and population of 56.5 million. Rajasthan \nhad been lagging the other states with slow economic growth and development; the state's per capita income is 69% of the \ncountry's average. While the state is still predominantly rural, the population shift from rural to urban areas has been a clear \ntrend. The state adopted a policy to promote urban development by providing basic urban infrastructure with sound urban \nplanning. \n8.  TA Description \na.  Link to country partnership strategy and/or regional cooperation strategy  \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been supporting the government of Rajasthan through the Rajasthan Urban \nInfrastructure Development Project (RUIDP) and the Rajasthan Urban Sector Development Investment Program (RUSDIP) \nto improve urban services and infrastructure in the state\u2019s major urban centers. While the RUIDP assisted the six largest \ncities in the state and is in an advanced stage of implementation with residents of the six cities already beginning to receive \nbenefits from improved services, 15 smaller urban local bodies (ULBs) are currently benefiting with the support of the \nRUSDIP in their urban environment improvement. The state government of Rajasthan recently asked ADB, through the \nGovernment of India, to provide further assistance with investment in urban environment improvement for the remaining \nselected ULBs of Rajasthan.  \n \nThe PPTA will assist the SGR in preparing a feasible investment program for ADB loan financing for improvement of urban \nservices and infrastructure in selected ULBs. This third phase intervention for Rajasthan will build on the experience of the \nRUIDP and RUSDIP, and support the needs for urgent improvements in rapidly growing towns.      \n \nb.  Impact  \nImpacts include improved living conditions and urban environment, and optimized social and economic development, in \nselected ULBs of Rajasthan. \n \nc.  Outcome \nThe desired outcome of the PPTA will be a feasible investment program for urban sector development in the smaller ULBs \nin the state of Rajasthan to be financed by an ADB loan.  \n \nd.  Outputs   \nThe PPTA will comprise activities for (i) feasibility studies for the investment program and necessary documents including \ntechnical, economic, financial, and safeguards due diligence required for preparing the investment program in accordance \nwith ADB policies and guidelines; (ii) identification of institutional development, financial management, and capacity \ndevelopment program for the selected ULBs under the investment program; (iii) identification of required land acquisition \nnotification with disclosure to affected people issued by the implementing agencies, and prepared resettlement guidelines; \n(iv) community awareness and livelihood generation programs; (v) improvement of overall readiness of participating ULBs \nfor project implementation; and (vi) completion of project readiness-related activities to fast track investment program \nimplementation, including detailed design works. \n \nThe outputs of the TA are as follows: \na.  an agreed design for a feasible investment program for ADB financing after completion of a feasibility study, \nincluding all necessary documents for loan processing, reflecting technical, economic, financial, and safeguards \ndue diligence; \nb.  capacity development of the prospective executing and implementing agencies to improve program management \nand implementation with resulting impact on timely and effective program implementation; \nc.  detailed engineering and design reports for selected investment components, including tender documents; and \nd.  an investment program ready for implementation according to the project readiness criteria agreed with \nGovernment of India \n ", "     Appendix 4       65\n9.  Assumptions and Risks  \nThe PPTA and ensuing investment program are expected to result in net positive benefits to the environment and residents \nof target ULBs in the state of Rajasthan. The prospective executing and implementing agencies in the state have good \nexperience in processing and/or implementing ADB-funded urban projects, however the institutional and financial capacity \nof the ULBs is generally low. To ensure the long-term sustainability of assets and service delivery, the project design will \nneed to include extensive capacity enhancement program for ULBs. Therefore, the PPTA and the ensuing investment \nprogram will assist the ULBs in building technical and planning capacity, and institutional and financial reform activities, as \nrequired for sustainable urban services delivery. \n10.

Key Development Issues to be Addressed  \nVarious transport infrastructure, such as an airport in Pakyong, East Sikkim, and the extension of the railway line from New \nJalpiaguri to Rangpo at the Sikkim border with West Bengal, is needed to ensure adequate connectivity between transport \ninfrastructure being planned in Sikkim. The land transport system must be optimally developed to ensure full realization of \nthe network benefits of transport infrastructure. This will ensure more effective utilization of funds in the state, and optimum \nsocial and economic benefits to the population of the state. \n12. TA Description  \nThe PATA will prepare a land transport master plan for the state of Sikkim to (i) ensure connectivity of different infrastructure \nbeing built, (ii) provide the land transport infrastructure necessary to support socioeconomic development of the state for the \nnext 10 years; and (iii) build planning capacity in land transport in the state to ensure that follow-on planning for required \ninfrastructure can be effectively implemented. \n \na.   Link to country partnership strategy and/or regional cooperation strategy  \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) CPS for 2009\u20132012 states that in view of the huge infrastructure investment required\u2014\nnearly $514 billion over the 11th Five Year Plan period\u2014ADB, in line with the Government\u2019s stated priorities in the 11th plan, \nwill continue to focus on infrastructure development in the transport, energy, urban, agriculture, and water resources \nmanagement sectors. ADB's country strategy in the transport sector emphasizes establishing seamless connectivity via \nroads: national highways, state roads, and rural roads, as well as connectivity with other modes of transport such as \nrailways. ADB will continue to expand operations to poorer states like Sikkim to help address interstate disparities, build \ncapacity, and support inclusive growth. This is in line with the Government's own development strategy, which emphasizes \npoverty reduction and social development through faster and more inclusive growth, and promotion of inclusive growth and \npoverty reduction through infrastructure development, as stated in the 11th Five Year Plan.  \n \nb.  Impact  \nThe impact will be to enhance efficiency of the planning, programming, policy formulation, and monitoring of the land \ntransport network comprising both roads and rail links such that connectivity in the state improves and the percentage of \nresidents having access to roads increases by 30% in the next 5 years and 70% in the next 10 years \n \nc.   Outcome  \nThe most optimum investment program for core land transport network to support socioeconomic growth of Sikkim for the \nnext 10 years will be adopted after considering different alternatives.  \n \nd.   Outputs \nThe core road and rail network to support future socioeconomic needs of the state for the next 10 years will be formulated \nas the prioritized master plan to guide investment decisions.  \n13. Assumptions and Risks       \nThe capacity of relevant state agencies to follow through with the planning process, as well as the availability of financial \nresources to execute the plan are potential issues and risks. \n14.

ADB inputs \nThe PATA will finance the engagement of a consultant firm with expertise in transport planning to provide 10 person-months \nof international and 45 person-months of national consultant input. The firm will be selected using quality and cost-based \nselection methods; a simplified technical proposal will be required.  \n \nd. Complementary inputs to be provided by government and/or other TA providing agencies \nThe Government will provide office accommodation, utilities, data and counterpart support equivalent to $250,000.  \n15. Nature and/or extent of government and beneficiary involvement in identifying or conceptualizing the assistance:  \nThe state government of Sikkim conceptualized the PATA; the scope of the work will be determined in close consultation \nwith relevant government agencies.   \n ", "     Appendix 4       69\n16.
