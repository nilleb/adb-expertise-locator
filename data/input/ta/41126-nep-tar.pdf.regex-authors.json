The country strategy and program (2005\u20132009)1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfor Nepal identifies the need to help build the Government\u2019s capacity for improved public policy \nanalysis and formulation, and more effective poverty monitoring. At the Government\u2019s request, \nthe technical assistance (TA) was included in ADB\u2019s country program for 2008. ADB undertook \na  Fact-Finding  Mission  during  7\u201325  July  2008  to  gather  inputs  from  relevant  government \nagencies and other stakeholders concerned for designing the TA. The Mission reached an \nunderstanding with the Government on the TA\u2019s objectives, scope, costs and financing plan, \nimplementation arrangements, and counterpart support. The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Institutional capacity for economic policy analysis in Nepal is weak due to a lack of \nappropriate policy analysis tools and an underdeveloped statistical system, among other factors. \nPublic policy formulation is often not based on a sound analytical foundation. The need for \nsound  economic  policy  analysis  has  become  more  critical  in  view  of  stagnating  economic \ngrowth.  There is a need for better understanding of the evolving structure of Nepal\u2019s economy, \nits  increasing  complexity,  and  the  interactions  between  different  sectors  of  the  economy. \nEconomic policy analysis has also been constrained by the inadequate coverage and low \nquality of national statistics. \n \n3.  In this context, ADB supported the Government in developing a macroeconomic model \nin 2005\u2014Nepal Macroeconomic Model (NMEM)\u2014as part of TA for Strengthening Institutional \nCapacity  for  Public  Debt  Management3 to  strengthen  institutional  capacity  for  public  debt \nsustainability  analysis  and  management.  The  NMEM  is  based  on  the  Keynesian  income\u2013\nexpenditure approach in which gross domestic product (GDP) is determined endogenously. \nApart from being used by the Government for debt sustainability analyses, Nepal Rasta Bank \n(NRB)\u2014the central bank of Nepal\u2014has also been using the NMEM for economic forecasting. \n \n4.  However, the NMEM\u2019s utility has become limited due to some major developments in \nrecent years. First, the structure of Nepal\u2019s economy has changed significantly. Agriculture\u2019s \ncontribution to GDP has declined from 48% in the early 1990s to 33% in recent years, whereas \nthe services sector\u2019s contribution has grown to about 51% from 34%. Industry\u2019s share of GDP \nhas remained largely unchanged at about 16%. The national accounts also underestimate \ncertain incomes, such as migrant workers\u2019 remittances, which have grown sharply since 2004. \nSecond, there have been some major revisions of key macroeconomic data standards since the \nNMEM was developed, including the national accounts, fiscal account, and the balance of \npayments. In view of these changes, the Government sees the need for NMEM to be updated \nand enhanced for analytical work and macroeconomic forecasting, and has requested ADB\u2019s \nsupport in this regard.   \n \n5.  The NMEM, originally developed for supporting debt sustainability analysis, has certain \nlimitations for the evaluation of policies that affect various sections of the economy in different \nways. The approach of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) modeling has emerged \nas an appropriate tool for policy analysis and conceptual support for decision making by policy \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Nepal for Strengthening Institutional Capacity for Public Debt \nManagement . Manila (TA 4017-NEP, approved on 6 December 2002 and completed in December 2005).  \n ", "2   \nmakers. Compared with traditional macroeconomic models, DSGE models have the advantage \nof stating explicitly the microeconomic issues that give rise to macroeconomic dynamics. DSGE \nmodels are used to organize thinking, measure the importance of different phenomena, and \nprovide policy prescriptions. They could be used for quantitative data analysis, especially short- \nand medium-term forecasting, and projections of macroeconomic aggregates under different \nscenarios. A DSGE model would not only allow overcoming the limitations of the NMEM, but \nalso provide a tool for research and analysis of macroeconomic aggregates, and derive policy \nimplications. It will establish a valid mechanism for policy makers to base policies on sound \nquantitative analysis. However, being a complex and sophisticated tool, it requires both internal \nconsistency in relation to the underlying assumptions of the rational decision-making agents and \nexternal consistency in relation to other subfields of economics. The capacity of policy-making \ninstitutions  will  need  to  be  strengthened  substantially  to  generate  effective  policy  analysis \nthrough these tools. Key user agencies\u2019 capacity will also need to be strengthened for updating \nand modifying the model when necessary. \n \n6.  Given the importance of reliable and timely macroeconomic data for policy analysis and \nformulation, development planning, and effective monitoring and evaluation, ADB has also been \nassisting in improving Nepal\u2019s statistical system, including a comprehensive diagnostic study on \nNepal\u2019s statistical system under TA for Statistical Capacity Building in the Asia and Pacific \nRegion4 in 2007. The TA assessed Nepal\u2019s state of statistics development, reviewed ADB\u2019s \nassistance for statistics development, and identified the country\u2019s ongoing needs. The review \nconcluded that Nepal\u2019s statistical system is still weak at generating adequate statistics that meet \nanalytical and policy needs, and that the weaknesses are largely due to ineffective supporting \nlegislation and institutional setup, data gaps, and inadequate levels of human resource and \ntechnology development. A weak institutional and legal framework was identified as contributing \nto the ineffectiveness of the National Statistics Act, inadequate legal status of the apex policy-\nmaking statistical body\u2014the National Statistical Council (NSC)\u2014a lack of autonomy of the \nnational statistics office\u2014the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)\u2014and weak statistics units in \nline ministries and departments. In addition, many data gaps still exist in the statistical system.  \n \n7.  Against  this  backdrop,  the  diagnostic  study  proposed  a  long-term  action  plan  for \nimproving Nepal\u2019s statistical system by strengthening the legal and institutional framework; \nmeeting  data  gaps  in  socioeconomic  statistics;  improving  the  quality  and  coverage  of  the \npresent statistical outputs; and upgrading information technology, infrastructure, and human \nresource development and training. To improve the legal and institutional framework, the action \nplan stressed the urgent need to implement the Consolidated National Statistical Plan (CNSP) \nwithout further delay.5 The TA also identified other key short- to medium-term priorities among \nthe needs identified by the long-term action plan. These included support for conducting an \neconomic census and establishing a system of follow-up surveys of enterprises; and continuing \nto improve the national accounts statistics by sustaining the recent initiatives on institutional \nsector accounts and developing quarterly national accounts (QNA), including improvement of \nagricultural statistics.  \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2006.

Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Nepal for \nStrengthening the National Statistical System. Manila (TA 3451-NEP, approved on 1 June and closed in 2004), \nproposed revision of the Statistical Act 1958 to reflect emerging changes, raising the status and autonomy of CBS \nto a ministry level, establishment of a system of designated statistics, and revamping the NSC into a more \nfunctional body. Implementation of the CNSP has been delayed mainly due to frequent changes of government \nand budget constraints.  However, there has been some recent progress, including prioritization of the scope of the \nCNSP and finalization of the draft amendment to the Statistical Act, which is currently under the Legal Reform \nCommission\u2019s review.  \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA will enhance the Government\u2019s capacity for economic policy formulation based \non reliable macroeconomic data and sound policy analysis. This will be achieved by helping to \nfurther improve the national statistical system and develop and use macroeconomic models for \npolicy simulations, macroeconomic forecasting, and economic planning. The national statistics \nsystem will be improved by supporting legal and institutional reforms; helping to compile QNA; \nand building institutional capacity for continued improvement of the national accounts, which \nhave been updated based on the 1993 System of National Accounts beginning in FY2008 and \ntaking FY2001 as the base year. The macroeconomic models will help policy makers in devising \nsuitable policies for medium-term growth and preparing development plans. \n \n9.  The outputs of the TA will be: (i) implementation of the CNSP to strengthen the national \nstatistical system; (ii) a system for compiling QNA and GDP estimates for FY2007\u2013FY2010;  (iii) \nupdated and upgraded NMEM based on the revised macroeconomic data standards in recent \nyears and structural changes in the economy; (iv) a DSGE-type model for Nepal; and (v) \nstrengthened capacity of key institutions\u2014including, among others, NRB, the National Planning \nCommission (NPC), Ministry of Finance (MOF), and CBS\u2014for macroeconomic data collection, \ncompilation, and analysis and forecasting. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The proposed TA will have two components: (i) improving the national statistical system, \nand (ii) upgrading the NMEM and developing a DSGE-type macroeconomic model. \n \n11.  Component A will be based on the recommendations of TA for Statistical Capacity \nBuilding in the Asia and Pacific Region. Under this component, the Government will implement \nthe CNSP by taking necessary actions for enactment of a new statistical act (a draft of which \nhas already been prepared), followed by the restructuring and upgrading of CBS, strengthening \nof NSC, and establishment of a designated statistical system. The TA will provide necessary \ntraining to familiarize government agencies concerned with the new legislation and institutional \nstructures. In support of the Government\u2019s continued efforts to further improve the national \naccounts, the TA will assist in compiling QNA and estimating quarterly GDP series at both \ncurrent and constant prices based on the production (industry) approach. The TA will also \nexamine  the  feasibility  of  compiling  quarterly  GDP  estimates  based  on  the  expenditure \napproach. Primarily, compilation of the QNA will be based on existing administrative records. In \nthis regard, the TA will, in coordination with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), support CBS \nand other related agencies in implementing IMF\u2019s recommendations6 for developing a system of \nQNA based on existing administrative records. The TA will also support certain priority surveys \nand studies, including a horticulture survey, to help fill data gaps for compiling the QNA. Data \ncollected through existing sources and new surveys will be compiled into a QNA series covering \nFY2007\u2013FY2010,  which  will  be  analyzed  to  ensure  consistency  with  the  annual  national \naccounts (ANA). Based on these activities, a system of QNA data collection, compilation, and \nanalysis  will  be  established  for  estimating  quarterly  GDP  series  in  the  future.  To  ensure \nsustainability of the QNA system, the TA will provide on-the-job training for CBS staff on QNA \n                                                 \n6  At the request of the Government, IMF has been providing technical advice to CBS for developing QNA since 2005. \nIMF\u2019s Real Sector Statistics Mission in July 2006 reviewed the quarterly indicators and planned quarterly surveys, \nand made specific recommendations for QNA development. IMF\u2019s recommendations focus on collecting data from \nadministrative sources and compiling and analyzing data series that are already available. \n ", "4   \ndata collection and compilation, organize workshops and seminars to orient the staff of other \nline ministries and departments responsible for supplying data, design necessary surveys and \ntrain them on data collection and analysis, and support an apprenticeship program with a well-\nestablished regional statistical organization to enhance the skills of CBS staff in compiling QNA.  \n \n12.  Under the macroeconomic modeling component (component B), the TA will support \nupdating and enhancing the NMEM to cater to the needs of NPC and MOF for macroeconomic \nanalysis, growth projections, and development planning. The model will also be enhanced by \nincluding the monetary variables and their linkages for use by NRB for analysis of monetary \naspects  of  the  economy.  Additionally,  the  TA  will  support  development  of  a  DSGE-type \nmacroeconomic model with adequate specifications with respect to production, consumption, \ntrade, and price mechanisms among other factors. The TA will support collecting and organizing \ndata for developing a DSGE-type model suitable for the evolving structure of the Nepalese \neconomy. As NPC and MOF are important government agencies using macroeconomic models \nfor medium-term growth projections and planning, mechanisms will be developed to ensure their \neffective participation in model development and capacity building. \n \n13.  The TA will also help develop a calibration methodology for making the models user-\nfriendly. Model-consistent data links, reporting systems, and user manuals for both models will \nbe developed during the implementation period. Both models will be designed to facilitate and \nsupport  policy  simulation  and  analysis  for  making  pragmatic  policy  recommendations  and \ndecisions.  Training  will  be  provided  for  agencies  and  other  concerned  stakeholders  to \nstrengthen their technical capacity for analytical and computation skills for macroeconomic \nmodeling. In particular, training will enable them to run the models, analyze policy implications, \nand modify the models as needed to ensure sustainability of the TA objectives. To facilitate and \nmaximize  the  use  of  these  models,  the  TA will  establish  an  information  technology-based \nsystem for easy and wider access to the models and develop user manuals for key institutions \nsuch as NPC, MOF, NRB, and others.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $825,000. ADB will provide $675,000 on a grant \nbasis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The main items to be funded by ADB are the services of \ninternational and domestic consultants, equipment, workshops and seminars, and surveys. The \nGovernment will contribute $150,000 equivalent to provide office accommodation, counterpart \nstaff support, facilities for seminars and meetings, and other administrative expenses. Details of \nthe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  Institutional Arrangement. CBS will be the Executing Agency (EA) for component A of \nthe TA and NRB for component B. Both components of the TA will be implemented in close \ncoordination with other relevant Government agencies, including MOF, NPC, and other line \nministries and departments. \n \n16.  A  steering  committee  will  be  formed\u2014chaired  by  the  relevant  NPC  member  and \ncomprising representatives of MOF, the NPC secretariat, NRB, CBS, and other relevant line \nministries and departments as necessary\u2014to provide overall policy guidance for implementation \nof the TA, monitor progress, and take necessary actions to facilitate implementation of the TA. \nSeparate technical committees will provide guidance at the technical and operational level. The \ntechnical committee for component A will be chaired by the director general of CBS, while the \n ", "  5\ntechnical committee for component B will be chaired by the executive director of the Research \nDepartment of NRB. The technical committees will comprise representatives of MOF, NPC, and \nother  agencies  as  appropriate.  The  steering  committee  and  the  technical  committee  for \ncomponent A will also function as coordinating bodies for facilitating the supply of necessary \nadministrative data from government ministries and departments concerned with compilation of \nQNA.7 The technical committee for component B will coordinate with other macroeconomic \nmodeling activities, including the proposed United Nations Development Programme supported \nmacroeconomic modeling for monitoring the Millennium Development Goals.  \n \n17.  Both EAs (CBS and NRB) will appoint focal persons who will be responsible for overall \nsupervision and coordination of the implementation of their respective TA components. The \nfocal persons will oversee the day-to-day implementation of the TA activities, maintain close \ncoordination with all relevant stakeholders, and manage the consultants\u2019 inputs. \n \n18.  Consulting  Services.  A  total  of  10  person-months  of  international  and  21-person \nmonths of national consulting services will be provided under the TA. Individual consultants will \nbe  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). The outline of the terms of reference for the consulting services is \nin Appendix 3. Equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time), and will be handed over to the Government on the \ncompletion of the TA. ADB will recruit the consultants, and disbursements under the TA will be \nconducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2008, \namended from time to time). \n \n19.  The lead consultants will submit inception reports\u2014including a detailed work program for \nthe  TA  to  the  steering  committee,  respective  focal  units,  and  ADB\u2014within  30  days  of \ncommencement of the TA. Quarterly progress reports and mid-term reports will be submitted to \nthe EAs and ADB separately. Draft final reports (1 month prior to completion of the TA) and final \nreports (after completion of the TA) will be submitted to the respective focal units and ADB. \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months from November 2008 to October 2010. \nSeparate tripartite meetings among the respective EAs, TA consultants, and ADB will be held at \nleast twice per year, or more frequently as required, and chaired by the heads of the respective \ntechnical committees, to review implementation progress of the TA components, address any \nimplementation issues, and provide guidance to the TA consultants. The steering committee will \nmeet at the beginning of the TA and every 4 months thereafter to guide TA activities and resolve \nany policy and implementation issues.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of the technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $675,000 on a grant basis \nto  the  Government  of  Nepal  for  Strengthening  Capacity  for  Macroeconomic  Analysis,  and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n7  The interagency flow of such data is expected to improve in the longer term with the implementation of the CNSP.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nEconomic policies based  Legal and institutional  Review missions, progress  Adequate human resources and \non an improved statistical  reforms (CNSP)  reports, and timely publication  interagency coordination for \nsystem (national  implemented, and  of quarterly gross domestic  regular supply of necessary \naccounts) and sound  capacity developed for  product (GDP) estimates  data for compilation of QNA \nquantitative  compiling quarterly     \nmacroeconomic analysis  national accounts (QNA)     The Government\u2019s commitment \n      to adopt the analytical \nCapacity developed for  Quantitative tools are used  framework developed \ngrowth projections,  for ex ante and ex post   \nmacroeconomic  analysis of the Government  Risk \nforecasting, and  policies  Political instability affecting \ndevelopment planning    implementation of CNSP  \n   \nOutcome       Assumptions \nComponent A:      Government commitment to \nA more conducive legal  Promulgation of a new  Nepal Gazette, review  legal and institutional reforms \nand institutional  Statistical Act and  missions, and assessment of  for statistical development \nenvironment for improving  institutional restructuring  technical assistance (TA)   \nthe national statistical    progress reports of  Availability of qualified \nsystem     consultants  government counterpart staff \n      and their continuity \nA system of QNA- Trained Central Bureau of  Budget speech, interim policy   \ncompilation established  Statistics (CBS) staff  announcements, and periodic  Risk \n  capable of compiling QNA  development plans  Lack of priority and institutional \n    environment to sustain the \n  Short- to medium-term  quantitative and policy analysis \nComponent B:  macroeconomic  process. \nMacroeconomic tools  forecasting undertaken for \ndeveloped for short- to  policy analysis and \nmedium-term  formulation  \nmacroeconomic   \nforecasting and policy \nanalysis \n \nOutput      Assumption \nComponent A:      Availability of qualified \n1.
