INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) is closely aligned to the recently \napproved Strategy 2030 and will help the Asian Development Bank (ADB) respond best to highly \nrelevant knowledge needs for Bangladesh\u2019s inclusive and sustainable development.1 The TA will \ncreate  innovative  and  operation-relevant  knowledge  solutions.  Knowledge  products  will  be \ndeveloped  on  strategic issues for  Bangladesh\u2019s  economic transformation  and  core  sectors \nrelevant to ADB\u2019s operations in the country. The policy development and advisory work under the \nTA will include the preparation of the background documents and inputs for overall policymaking, \ndevelopment plans, sector development, and potential project development. \n \n2.  The TA is included in ADB\u2019s current country operations business plan, and consistent with \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Bangladesh,  2016\u20132020.2 The  country  partnership \nstrategy prioritizes the knowledge support for economic and sector analysis to support more rapid \nstructural transformation of the Bangladesh economy, including in-depth analysis of economic \ncorridor development.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Bangladesh has achieved impressive economic and social development over the past \ndecade. From 2009 to 2018, the average gross domestic product growth rate was 6.5%, and \nBangladesh achieved a record high gross domestic product growth rate of 7.9% in fiscal year \n2018. The country is now keen to consolidate these gains and accelerate its economic momentum \nby attaining an annual growth rate of 8.0% by fiscal year 2020. Ultimately, Bangladesh aspires to \nmake  growth  more  inclusive  and  reduce  poverty  by  creating  jobs  and  fostering  regionally \nbalanced development. \n \n4.  However, the country still faces a number of medium- to longer-term challenges, including \npreference erosion and higher cost of finance and debt servicing liability arising from its possible \ngraduation from least developed country (LDC) status in the near future.4  To attain its vision to \nbecome a developed country by 2041, Bangladesh needs to overcome middle-income challenges, \nsuch  as  low  productivity,  narrow  economic  base,  and  growing  inequality,  and  seize  new \nopportunities from the changing economic landscape, such as the advent of Industry 4.0\u2014the \ntrend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies. \n \n5.  Recognizing  these  challenges,  the  Government  of  Bangladesh  has  committed  to \nmodernizing the country\u2019s agriculture, strengthening industrialization, improving human capital, \nand accelerating regionally balanced development. Bangladesh aims to sustain the growth \nmomentum, and accelerate the growth for its longer-term goal to become a developed country. \nInnovative knowledge solutions remain one crucial key element to achieve the goal. Extensive \npolicy  research  and  analytical  advice  will  help  policy  makers  understand  the  development \nchallenges and conditions unique to Bangladesh. \n \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2016. Country Partnership Strategy: Bangladesh, 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 April 2018. \n4  On 15 March 2018, the United Nations Committee for Development Policy officially declared that Bangladesh has \nattained the first eligibility for graduation from LDC and handed over a letter to that effect to Bangladesh. To graduate \nfrom the LDC category, Bangladesh has to cross at least two of these three thresholds: (i) gross national income per \ncapita to be $1,242 or above, (ii) human assets index to score 66 or above, and (iii) economic vulnerability index to \nscore 32 or below during two consecutive triennial reviews until 2024. \n ", "2 \n6.  One critical area for knowledge solutions is broadening the economic base with an \nemphasis on the lagging regions for industrialization. Bangladesh has adopted the establishment \nof economic corridors as a holistic development approach to drive structural transformation and \nimprove welfare across various regions. Economic corridor development is closely aligned with \nthe Seventh Five Year Plan.5 It entails constructing world-class infrastructure that is typically \naligned with a major transport network, connecting urban clusters with vibrant industrial zones, \nand providing a favorable and competitive environment for setting up businesses and facilitating \nthe efficient movement of goods and people. The proposed Bangladesh Economic Corridor (BEC) \nwill run from Jessore in the country\u2019s southwest to Sylhet in the northeast via Dhaka, and will \ninclude an extension to several key gateways. This is one of the national corridors identified in \nthe South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Operational Plan with potential to \ndevelop into a regional economic corridor.6  \n \n7.  ADB supported the preparation of a comprehensive development plan (CDP) for the \nSouthwest  Bangladesh  Economic  Corridor  (SWBEC)\u2014phase  1  of  the  envisaged  BEC \nalignment\u2014under a regional TA project.7 The CDP offers a knowledge solution for the efficient \nand integrated implementation of the economic corridor project. While the envisaged SWBEC is \nexpected to contribute significantly to the development of the southwest region, the proposed \nphase 2 of the BEC will integrate the northeast region of the country with the more vibrant growth \ncenters of Dhaka and Chittagong. Extensive planning will need to be conducted for the second \nphase  for  the  entire  corridor  alignment,  from  the  southwest  to  the  northeast,  to  boost \nBangladesh\u2019s transport and trade linkages with South Asia and integrate with rapidly growing \nmarkets in Southeast Asia and East Asia, maximizing its geographical advantage. It will promote \nsynergies between economic corridors being developed in SASEC countries to maximize the \ndevelopment impacts of investments.  \n \n8.  In addition to the phase 2 of the BEC, this TA will also respond to needs for analytical work \nand knowledge solutions in a wide range of sectors and thematic areas. It will support the \nformulation  of  sound  interventions  and  development  strategies  to  maintain  prudent \nmacroeconomic policies, accelerate economic transformation, improve human capital, introduce \nclimate-friendly smart agriculture, upgrade industry, boost foreign direct investment, expand the \ntax base, address infrastructure gaps, and improve the investment climate. A key element of \neconomic transformation will be the use of high level technologies and skilled human capital that \nare optimally suited to deliver a knowledge economy.  \n \n9.  Aside  from  a  deficiency  in  innovative  knowledge  solutions,  weak  governance  and \ninstitutional  capacities  continue  to  constrain  Bangladesh\u2019s  development  prospects.  The \ninternational development community\u2019s commitment to strengthen governance and institutional \ncapacities  was  reaffirmed  in  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals,  particularly  Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 17, which aims to enhance the effectiveness of capacity development to \ndeveloping countries.8 ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 ascertains that ADB will strengthen its role as a \nknowledge provider and continue to work with the government to enhance their ability to address \ndevelopment issues and deliver projects.9 For more impactful knowledge dissemination and \n                                                \n5  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Planning. 2015.

These can \nprovide  opportunities  for  in-depth  discussions  and  deliver  comprehensive  inputs  to  policy \nformulation. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: policy environment to support regionally \nbalanced, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable development in Bangladesh improved.10 The TA \nwill  have  the  following  outcome:  well-informed  and  well-developed  policies  on  economic \nmanagement solutions adopted.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output  1:  Comprehensive  development  plan  for  the  Northeast  Bangladesh \nEconomic Corridor prepared. Following the completion of the CDP for the SWBEC, the TA will \nprepare the CDP for the Northeast Bangladesh Economic Corridor, the phase 2 of the BEC. This \nintegrated study will (i) identify the priority economic nodes to be developed; (ii) pinpoint priority \nindustries for future development along the corridor, including micro, small, and medium-sized \nenterprises; (iii) craft an infrastructure strategy that identifies priority infrastructure development \nprojects  across  various  sectors;  (iv)  analyze  the  opportunities  for  Bangladesh\u2019s  successful \nintegration into the international economic corridors, including the Bangladesh\u2013China\u2013India\u2013\nMyanmar  Economic  Corridor;  and  (v)  recommend  an  appropriate  set  of  policies  and  a \ncorresponding institutional framework to streamline the regulatory process for setting up and \noperating businesses efficiently.12 The CDP will take into account climate change and disaster \nrisks in its analysis and promote environmentally sustainable development. Digital publication is \nthe default approach for dissemination. However, external publications can be printed for targeted \nstakeholders and high-level government officials. \n \n12.  Output 2: Knowledge products for inclusive and sustainable development produced. \nKnowledge products covering various sectors and themes will be produced to meet Bangladesh\u2019s \ngrowing knowledge solution needs. This may include, but is not limited to, logistics sector \ndevelopment, infrastructure development, economic zones development, industry development, \nregional cooperation and integration, new and innovative technologies, rural development and \nfood security, macroeconomic management, public\u2013private partnership, social development, \nclimate change and disaster risk management, and other analytical work relevant to ADB\u2019s \noperations in Bangladesh.13 The knowledge products will also contribute to the preparation of the \ngovernment\u2019s Eighth Five Year Plan. Technical studies, working papers, and policy briefs will be \nproduced to effectively disseminate the findings, recommendations, and knowledge solutions. \nThe research methodology will employ quantitative methods grounded in relevant economic \ntheory,  supplemented  by  qualitative  analysis.  As  relevant,  enterprise  surveys  and  primary \ninteractions with stakeholders will be conducted. Gender elements will be considered in the \nknowledge products as appropriate. Digital publication is the default approach for dissemination. \n                                                \n10 Defined by the TA. \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n12 ADB recognizes \u201cChina\u201d as the People\u2019s Republic of China.  \n13 The Government of Bangladesh plans to establish 100 economic zones by 2030 to create jobs for 10 million people \nand produce products and services worth $40 billion. http://www.beza.gov.bd/.  \n ", "4 \nHowever,  external  publications  can  be  printed  for  targeted  stakeholders  and  high-level \ngovernment officials. \n \n13.  Output 3: Institutional capacity and knowledge enhanced. The TA will contribute to \nenhancing the capacity and knowledge of the policy makers and government officials through \ncapacity building and knowledge events, based on, but not limited to, the knowledge products \ngenerated by the TA. The capacity building and knowledge events will include (i) development \nforums on issues faced by Bangladesh; (ii) policy workshops; (iii) knowledge dissemination \nactivities; and (iv) others, such as site visits and study visits for relevant officials.
