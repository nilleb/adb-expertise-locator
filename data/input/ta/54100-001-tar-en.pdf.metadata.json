INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will strengthen the capacity of \ndeveloping  member countries (DMCs) to facilitate access to quality jobs.1 The TA will \n(i) develop  new  directions  for  social  protection  in  labor  markets,  (ii)  develop  effective \napproaches for skills development and job facilitation, and (iii) initiate a coherent approach to \nfacilitating quality jobs for DMCs through Asian Development Bank (ADB) operations.  \n \n2.  The TA is in line with the Strategy 2030 operational plan for priority 1, pillar 2, which \nunderlines the importance of quality jobs in addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequality.2 With the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic resulting in lockdowns and \nhalts to economic activities, progress made toward job growth and poverty reduction is \ncritically at risk. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimated that employment for \n125 million full-time workers in Asia and the Pacific will be lost in the second quarter of 2020, \nwith tourism, retail, and manufacturing being most affected.3 ADB estimated that this would \nlead 34.3 million people  to fall  into extreme poverty.4 The TA  is included in the 2020 \nManagement-approved results-based work plan of the Sustainable Development and Climate \nChange Department.5  \n   \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Access to quality jobs. Facilitating increased access to quality jobs is essential for \ncreating a region without poverty and with reduced inequality. Asia and the Pacific has \nexperienced rapid economic progress over the past 25 years, creating 30 million jobs annually \nand contributing to significant improvements in living standards.6 The growth in jobs has been \naccompanied by improved productivity, higher earnings, and large reductions in poverty. \nDespite continued economic growth (4.6% in 2019) and a relatively low unemployment rate \n(4.4% in 2019), developing Asia\u2019s job challenge is far from over. While new jobs were created \nrapidly as part of economic growth, they have not always been quality jobs that provide a \nsecure  and  stable  source  of  income,  particularly  for  the  poorest  and  most  vulnerable. \nMoreover, several structural weaknesses in the labor market threaten the progress that has \nbeen made. The share of youth not in employment, education, or training is on the rise, \nreaching 24.3% in 2019; and labor underutilization was 10.3% in 2019. Importantly, two-thirds \nof the workforce remain in the informal sector, while 4.2% of workers in the region continue to \nlive in extreme poverty and another 14.6% live in moderate poverty.7 Gender disparities in \nlabor force participation also continue to persist, particularly in South Asia (23.2% among \nwomen  compared  with  76.9%  among  men  in  2019).  Pandemic-related  job  losses \ndisproportionately harm workers with basic levels of education.8 Additional and concerted \nefforts  are  required  to  create  inclusive  and  quality  jobs  to  prevent  long-term  damage, \nespecially to the most vulnerable, including women, youth, migrant workers, and informal \neconomy workers.  \n \n1  Quality jobs are decent and productive jobs that provide earnings contributing to workers\u2019 well-being, access to \nsocial protection benefits, safe working conditions, and access to social dialogue. These four components are in \nline with Sustainable Development Goal 8.5 on the achievement of full and productive employment and decent \nwork for all women and men by 2030. \n2 ADB. 2019.

A major challenge for Asian economies is to \ncope with structural changes and disruptions in job markets. The COVID-19 pandemic is \ncausing a massive disruption in the labor market, with significant immediate and longer term \nsocial and economic implications, affecting both workers and enterprises. Even before the \ncurrent crisis, technological advances, demographic changes, climate change, and migration \nwere disrupting jobs and the skills employees need to do them, leaving many workers with \nless  secure  jobs,  compounded  by  a  structural  shift  from  manufacturing  to  services.9 \nTechnological disruptions can lead to job displacements and changing skill and task profiles, \nimposing hardship  on  workers, particularly female workers, who  may  not yet have the \nnecessary skills to adapt to new tasks or access job opportunities in the new digital economy. \nNew forms of  employment  are accompanied by  less job security, requiring workers to \npotentially  have  several  part-time,  on-call,  and  temporary  jobs  to  sustain  income  and \nlivelihoods. Demographic changes are also visible in the region, with many countries in South \nand Southeast Asia, and the Pacific experiencing a youth bulge, while other countries in East \nand Southeast Asia are witnessing rapid aging. Demographic changes are contributing to \ngrowth in migration (domestic and external) and expanding demand for skills and care services \nto support aging societies in the region and globally. Climate change is another major trend \nshaping the future of work, creating both challenges and opportunities, e.g., through green \njobs. The COVID-19 crisis exacerbates many of these structural changes in what was already \na vulnerable and rapidly changing situation in the labor market for workers in developing Asia. \n \n5.  Social  protection  systems.  Improved  social  protection  systems  are  needed  to \naddress growing labor market imperfections, and support workers\u2019 access to quality jobs. The \nlabor market is increasingly unpredictable, with an increasing number of temporary jobs \nrequiring an ever more skilled workforce. With long-term employment in decline, it is important \nto protect workers moving frequently between jobs. Income replacement protection is needed \nfor fast-changing labor markets with frequent spells of unemployment, together with skilling \nand re-skilling support, and job facilitation allowing workers to move between jobs during their \nworking life.10 During the lockdown period of the COVID-19 crisis, the role of social protection \nto lessen the impacts of shocks and to provide temporary income support has been highlighted. \nSocial protection measures have taken the form of wage subsidies to employers (on the \ncondition that the worker remains employed), unemployment benefits, targeted cash transfers \nto individuals who lost their jobs because of the lockdown, and food support to families. Social \nprotection support during COVID-19 is building on existing programs or creating new ones. \nWorldwide, countries are spending an average of $44 per capita on the COVID-19 social \nprotection  response. 11  Countries  with  large  informal  economies,  low  social  protection \ncoverage, and weak or no social registries are struggling to put in place adequate responses \nto the shock. During the transition and recovery periods, social protection systems will need \nto adapt to the \u201cnew normal,\u201d keeping in mind the likely continuation of social distancing \nmeasures, high unemployment (especially in highly impacted sectors), and low or even \nnegative economic growth. This period will continue to affect those with less secure incomes \nand jobs disproportionately. Women are more likely to be excluded from any kind of social \nprotection because of their concentration in informal jobs. Employment prospects of young \nworkers are often more sensitive to fluctuations in demand. Other vulnerable groups include \nmigrants,  older  workers,  temporary  or  casual  workers,  and  workers  in  new  forms  of \nemployment including the gig economy. The challenge will be to get people who are able to \nwork back into productive employment, while keeping the most vulnerable protected.    \n \n \n9  M. Helble, S. Khatiwada, and B. Shepherd. 2020.

Training systems need to adapt to the future of work, and job \nfacilitation needs to be enhanced for women and vulnerable groups. The extensive disruptions \ncaused by COVID-19 have reinforced attention on the skills deficit. Adapting employees\u2019 skills \nand roles to post-pandemic  work  will be crucial  for business  resilience.12 In 2017, the \nMcKinsey Global Institute estimated that as many as 375 million workers\u2014or 14% of the \nglobal workforce\u2014would have to switch occupations or acquire new skills by 2030 because of \nautomation and artificial intelligence.13 After COVID-19, talent shortages in some new digital \noccupations  may  arise,  making  lack  of  digital  skills  more  acute,  which  is  particularly \nchallenging for many women, given the digital skills gap.14 A survey conducted by the Everest \nGroup in early 2020 found that 86% of enterprises considered the talent shortage a key barrier \nto achieving business outcomes even before the COVID-19 crisis.15 Digital transformation is \ninevitable and the COVID-19 response shows that digitalization will reach tipping points. Far \ngreater  investments  in  on-the-job  training;  upgrading  of  curriculums;  and  new,  flexible \ncredential systems are required to cope with changes.16 Singapore\u2019s SkillsFuture initiative is \nan example of skills development helping citizens to be productive, access higher order jobs, \nremain employable, and move to new jobs or roles. Training institutions need to become agile \nand versatile to service new occupations with new course offerings and \u201cback-to-school\u201d \nprograms  for  mid-career  workers  to  re-skill  and  upskill.  Skills  development  can  help \nprofessionalize important segments such as the care economy.17 Real-time labor market \ninformation systems, digital and other solutions to job facilitation, and modernization of public \nemployment exchanges will become increasingly crucial to address the needs of job seekers, \nincluding vulnerable workers and employers. \n  \n7.  Quality jobs. A coherent approach to facilitating quality jobs will amplify returns from \ninfrastructure and other investments for DMCs. Job creation from investments in infrastructure \ncan  be  reinforced  through  appropriate  diagnostic  tools.  Economic  and  fiscal  stimulus \npackages for inclusive post-COVID-19 recovery, including quality job creation, will mitigate job \nlosses.  Adequate  jobs  analysis  in  preparing  infrastructure  investments  can  boost  job \nprospects from infrastructure assets. A good example of job creation from infrastructure is in \nthe  ADB-supported  Visakhapatnam\u2013Chennai  Industrial  Corridor  Development  Program, \nlinking infrastructure with employment growth, potentially generating 11 million additional jobs \nover 30 years.18 A coherent jobs approach toward infrastructure and related investments, with \ndiagnostic tools that are gender-responsive to better understand demand- and supply-side \nconstraints to quality jobs, will help policy makers develop appropriate strategies, including \ntaking into account women\u2019s care burdens and the subsequent impacts on access to quality \njobs. ADB can draw on the experience of other organizations, such as the World Bank and \nthe ILO, to formulate approaches to quality jobs and develop contemporary tools for job \nfacilitation, job matching, and job creation. \n \n \n12 S.

The TA will have the following outcome: DMC capacity to facilitate access to \nquality jobs improved.19 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: New directions for social protection in labor markets developed. Under \noutput 1, the TA will explore adequate social protection responses to changing dynamics in \nthe labor market and during shocks such as the COVID-19 crisis. As a first step, the TA will \nprepare a study on adequate responses for social protection in labor markets as a medium-\nterm  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic\u2014identifying  strategies  for  post-COVID-19 \napproaches during the three stages: lockdown, transition, and recovery. The study\u2019s findings \nwill be shared with governments, the private sector, civil society, and development partners \nthrough workshops and webinars, with the final publication posted on the ADB website. The \nservices of a firm will be hired to prepare an analytical framework to identify the most \nappropriate measures to make social protection and labor market policies and programs more \nresponsive to COVID-19. The analytical framework will guide the preparation of country \nstudies in four DMCs,20 and recommend appropriate social protection  and labor market \nmeasures to be taken, with a focus on people who lost their jobs during the lockdown period, \nespecially vulnerable groups such as women, older workers, and migrants, as well as first-\ntime job seekers. Additional studies will be prepared on making social protection systems more \nresponsive to structural changes in the labor market. These studies will similarly be shared \nduring conferences and webinars, and posted on the ADB website.  \n \n10.  Output  2:  Effective  approaches  for  skills  development  and  job  facilitation \npromoted. The TA will look into new digital pathways for skills development (especially \nimportant in the  post-COVID-19 world)  and lifelong  learning options  that  keep workers \nadequately skilled and relevant in labor markets. Output 2 will (i) assess the changing \ndynamics of skills demand for new occupations, particularly digital skills for Industry 4.0 and \npost-COVID-19 work environments that will call for enhanced digital skills; (ii) assess new \napproaches for curriculum and course renewals that match the needs of rapidly evolving labor \nmarkets, together with new and tech-enabled delivery mechanisms for skills development, \nwith a matching design of flexible and online credentials and certification; and (iii) undertake \na survey of public employment exchanges and job-matching platforms to assess the potential \nuse of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence for job matching and career \ncoaching to strengthen real-time labor market forecasting and enhance access to quality jobs. \nBest practices in job facilitation and placement services will be documented. The country \nstudies in the four DMCs will include an assessment of changes in skills demand, new forms \nof credentials and certification, and the surveys of public employment exchanges and job \nmatching platforms. \n \n11.  Output 3: Coherent approach to facilitating quality jobs for developing member \ncountries  initiated.  The  TA  will  initiate  steps  toward  building  an  evidence-driven  and \nintegrated  approach  to  job  promotion  in  projects  in  economic  segments,  specifically \ninfrastructure. Output 3 will (i) map a selection of past, ongoing, and pipeline ADB projects to \nanalyze the potential for job creation, and highlight best practices to promote quality jobs; (ii) \ndevelop job diagnostics tools that DMCs can apply to assess the potential for quality job \n \n19 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n20 Country studies will be prepared for Bangladesh, Georgia, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea upon receipt of \ngovernment concurrence. If any of these DMCs does not agree to participate, new DMCs will be identified in \nconsultation with the regional departments. \n ", "       5 \ncreation, and incorporate concrete measures to amplify job creation effects of infrastructure \ninvestments; and (iii) prepare an illustrative guide on design elements to embed creation of \nquality jobs in ADB infrastructure operations. This tool will be used in selected pipeline projects \nto unlock the potential creation of quality jobs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($0.821 million from TASF-6 and $0.679 million \nfrom TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA.  The  Social  Development  Thematic  Group  and  the \nEducation  Sector  Group  under  the  Sustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change \nDepartment will be responsible for the administration and supervision of the TA.
