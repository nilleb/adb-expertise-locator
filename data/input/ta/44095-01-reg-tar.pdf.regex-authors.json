INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  At  the  Ninth  ASEAN  (Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations)  Summit  in  Bali  on  \n7 October 2003, the ASEAN leaders agreed to establish an ASEAN economic community (AEC) \nby 2020. That deadline was later brought forward to 2015. The AEC aims to achieve a single \nmarket and production base in ASEAN with free flow of goods, services, investments, capital, \nand skilled labor.   \n \n2.  Three major factors prompted ASEAN countries to advance the time frame to achieve \nthe AEC. First was the need to maintain the centrality of ASEAN's role despite the proliferation \nof free trade agreements between ASEAN and its dialogue partner countries. Many of ASEAN\u2019s \nfree trade agreements aim at full liberalization of the markets before or by 2015; if the ASEAN \nmarket is not fully integrated before the realization of ASEAN free trade agreements, ASEAN's \ncentral role faces the risk of being eroded. Second is the genuine political desire of ASEAN \nleaders to expedite ASEAN economic integration and thereby take it to the next level. Third is \nthe growing concern over the erosion of ASEAN's competitiveness vis-\u00e0-vis its key competitors, \nsuch as the People\u2019s Republic of China and India.   \n \n3.  ASEAN economic integration has been facilitated by a number of key initiatives. These \ninclude the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) based on the Common Effective Preferential Tariff \nScheme, the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services, and the ASEAN Investment Area. \nHowever, much remains to be done to move ASEAN economic integration forward.  \n \n4.  The need to achieve a single market in ASEAN has become more pressing than ever. \nASEAN member countries are fully aware that unless the realization of the AEC is expedited, \nASEAN economic integration could lose its momentum. This regional technical assistance (TA) \nwill examine the effectiveness and relevance of the goals and targets of the AEC in the context \nof the changing global, regional, and national economic landscape. The assessment will help \nidentify policy measures for ASEAN countries to realize the establishment of the AEC by 2015.1   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  In November 2007, the ASEAN leaders adopted the ASEAN Economic Community \nBlueprint to facilitate the realization of the AEC. The blueprint contains clearly defined goals and \ntargets for AEC operationalization. ASEAN has since made major strides toward these goals. \nThe  adoption  of  the  ASEAN  Trade  in  Goods  Agreement  (ATIGA)  and  the  ASEAN \nComprehensive  Investment  Agreement  (ACIA)\u2014which  provide  specific  targets  for  ASEAN \nmarket integration, and investment liberalization and facilitation\u2014are two of the most significant \nachievements in this regard.   \n \n6.  ASEAN has now largely completed the easy phase of promoting integration through \nintraregional trade liberalization. As of 2009, zero tariffs applied to 64% of products in the \nInclusion List of the ASEAN-6.2 The average tariff for ASEAN-6 under the Common Effective \nPreferential Tariffs Scheme has decreased to 1.5% from 12.8%, when the tariff-cutting exercise \ncommenced in 1993. What remains are the economically sensitive sectors, such as agriculture, \nsteel, and motor vehicles, and the more politically sensitive areas, such as reducing nontariff \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 August 2010. \n2  ASEAN-6 comprises Brunei Darussalam,  Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. \n ", "2   \nmeasures;  pursuing  faster  trade  liberalization  of  services;  establishing  an  effective  dispute \nsettlement mechanism; and reforming ASEAN\u2019s institutional structure.  \n \n7.  Moreover, the global economic landscape has also changed rapidly since the adoption \nof the AEC Blueprint, and all these changes are posing new and difficult challenges for ASEAN. \nThe 2008 global financial crisis changed the balance of global economic power, and spurred \nmassive  domestic  and  regional  policy  shifts.  Within  ASEAN,  the  crisis  has  produced \ncontradictory responses. On the one hand, the crisis has put pressure on ASEAN countries to \nexpedite ASEAN economic integration. On the other hand, some member countries have opted \nto rescind their commitments due to the impact of the global crisis.   \n \n8.  Therefore ASEAN must thoroughly assess the effectiveness and relevance of the AEC \ngoals  and  targets  in  the  context  of  this  changing  global,  regional,  and  national  economic \nlandscape. The assessment will help identify policy measures for ASEAN countries to continue \nto expedite implementation of the AEC by 2015.    \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.   Impact and Outcome \n9.  The overall objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness and relevance of the \ngoals and targets of the AEC. It will examine impediments to building an AEC by 2015. In this \nrespect, the study should materially extend, and provide additionality to Institute of Southeast \nAsian Studies (ISEAS) work documented in Brick by Brick: The Building of an ASEAN Economic \nCommunity.3 The study aims to (i) address major impediments to the AEC\u2019s building blocks (i.e., \nAFTA, ASEAN Investment Area, and ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services); (ii) examine \nthe  challenge  of  narrowing  the  economic  development  divide  within  ASEAN;  (iii)  examine \nwhether the goal of building an economic community in an uncompromised and legitimate way \ncan be realized given the current economic crisis and the relatively short timelines involved; and \n(iv) provide policy recommendations that could be implemented to expedite the integration \nprocess. In doing so, the TA should contribute to the timely achievement of the AEC (outcome), \nand ultimately help accelerate the process of ASEAN economic integration (impact).  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The assessment will look at the four pillars of the AEC and examine reforms for the \nASEAN institutional architecture to support deeper economic integration. \n \n11.  Pillar 1: Achievement of a single market production base. The progress of achieving \na single market and production base in ASEAN will be reviewed. The assessment will examine \nthe challenges and issues that hinder AEC implementation, and include four background papers \nto examine the following challenges, among others: \n \n(i)  Nontariff  measures.  While  most  ASEAN  countries  have  complied  with  tariff \nreductions under AFTA, utilization of the common effective preferential tariffs has \nbeen relatively low. One of the main reasons could be nontariff measures, which \npersist and impede greater intra-ASEAN trade. Hence, effectively tackling nontariff \n                                                 \n3  D. Hew, ed. 2007. Brick by Brick: The Building of an ASEAN Economic Community. Singapore: Institute of \nSoutheast Asian Studies. \n ", "  3\nmeasures and trade barriers would be crucial if a fully functioning AFTA is to be \nfeasible  by  2015.  This  paper  will  examine  the  status  of  the  use  of  nontariff \nmeasures in ASEAN and recommend measures to eliminate and/or remove barrier \ncomponents of existing nontariff measures.    \n(ii)  ASEAN dispute settlement. Despite the principles for dispute settlement set out \nin the 2004 ASEAN Protocol on Enhanced Dispute Settlement Mechanism and \nthe 1996 ASEAN Protocol on Dispute Settlement Mechanism, ASEAN countries \nhave yet to activate implementation of the protocol. This failure is due to many \nfactors,  including  the  traditional  ASEAN  way  of  settling  disputes  in  a \nnonconfrontational manner. This paper will find ways to strengthen the ASEAN \ndispute settlement mechanism as an important component for building a rules-\nbased  structure  for  ASEAN  cooperation.  Lessons  from  other  regions  in \nestablishing a dispute settlement mechanism will be presented. \n(iii)  Trade in services. Liberalization of services has been significantly bolder under \nthe  ASEAN  Framework  Agreement  on  Services  than  under  the  World  Trade \nOrganization\u2019s General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). In 2003, ASEAN \nleaders adopted the application of the ASEAN-X formula, which aims to expedite \nliberalization in priority service sectors including air transport and tourism, health \ncare, and e-ASEAN. However, the progress of ASEAN service liberalization is still \nslow. This paper will seek to determine why liberalization has been slow, and \nwhether ASEAN should adopt a new approach to liberalizing trade in services in \nASEAN.  \n(iv)  Investment liberalization. The scope of the ASEAN Investment Area has placed \ntoo  much  emphasis  on  intraregional  foreign  direct  investment\u2014it  prioritized \ninvestment  facilitation  and  provision  of  national  treatment  among  the  ASEAN \npartners. This strategy made very little sense, given that the bulk of foreign direct \ninvestment into the region comes from non-ASEAN economies like the United \nStates, Japan, Europe, and increasingly, the People\u2019s Republic of China and the \nRepublic of Korea. To rectify this, a new ASEAN Investment Area platform in the \nform of the ASEAN Comprehensive Investment Agreement was signed in 2008. \nThis  paper  will  examine  ASEAN  investment  liberalization  and  identify  ways  to \npromote the region\u2019s dynamic involvement in regional and international production \nnetworks. \n \n12.  Pillar 2: Achievement of a highly competitive economic region. Three background \npapers will look at the following issues: \n \n(i)  developing regional guidelines on competition policy; \n(ii)  protecting intellectual property rights in ASEAN; and \n(iii)  promoting ASEAN connectivity: infrastructure development (transport, energy, \ntelecommunications) and financing ASEAN infrastructure development.   \n  \n13.  Pillar  3:  Achievement  of  a  region  of  equitable  economic  development.  Three \nbackground papers will examine the following issues: \n  \n(i)  implementing the ASEAN policy blueprint for small and medium-sized enterprise  \ndevelopment; \n(ii)  operationalizing the concept of ASEAN (regional) public goods; and  \n(iii)  developing  subregional  cooperation  programs  such  as  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion,  the  Brunei  Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines  East \n ", "4   \nASEAN  Growth  Area  (BIMP-EAGA),  and  the  Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Thailand \nGrowth Triangle (IMT-GT). \n \n14.  Pillar 4: Achievement of a region fully integrated into the global economy. One \nbackground paper will review the following issues: \n \n(i)  developing approaches and mechanisms to strengthen ASEAN\u2019s role as a hub in \nEast Asian integration;  \n(ii)  promoting  wider  ASEAN  trade\u2014many  ASEAN  trade  and  investment  facility \nprograms, including capacity building, could be strengthened through synergy \nwith similar programs of wider regional cooperation arrangements (e.g., ASEAN \nPlus Three, Six, Eight, and proposals on the Asia Economic Community, Asia \nPacific free trade agreement);  \n(iii)  developing  effective  and  open  regionalism  cooperation  schemes  with  other \nregions (e.g., North America, Europe, and Latin America); and \n(iv)  ensuring  compatibility  with  World  Trade  Organization  principles  by  pursuing \nmeans  to  multilateralize  preferential  accords  and  liberalize  rules-of-origin, \nthereby minimizing distortions and trade diversion. \n \n15.  ASEAN institutional architecture to support deeper economic integration. Deeper \neconomic integration in ASEAN cannot be successfully achieved without establishing a stronger \ninstitutional structure. This paper will study the ASEAN institutional architecture and recommend \nhow it should evolve in the future. The \u201dASEAN Way\u201d has traditionally entailed noninterference \nin the internal affairs of member states and consensus-based decision making. The paper will \nexamine the ASEAN Charter and determine how ASEAN can move to a rules-based institution \nto oversee and coordinate the administrative tasks of establishing and setting policies.   \n \n16.  The background papers reviewing the impact of nontariff measures, services, investment, \nand ASEAN trade will include business surveys as part of the overall analytical framework. A \nperception survey will be undertaken to seek the opinions of leaders and the public on ASEAN \ncooperation.  \n \n17.  Reference materials for the background papers will include recent studies on ASEAN \nprepared by ADB, the ASEAN Secretariat and ISEAS. The findings of ADB's flagship studies\u2014\nEmerging  Asian  Regionalism:  A  Partnership  for  Shared  Prosperity,4 Infrastructure  for  a \nSeamless Asia,5 and Institutions for Integration: Toward an Asian Economic Community 6\u2014will \nbe useful reference materials. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund:  $300,000  from  TASF-IV  and \n$200,000 from TASF\u2014other sources. The financing will cover the remuneration and travel \nexpenses  of  international  and  national  consultants,  travel  expenses  of  conference  and \nworkshop resource persons, report production, and other miscellaneous expenses. The cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2008. Emerging Asian Regionalism: A Partnership for Shared Prosperity.

Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB will be the executing agency.  The TA will be implemented by the Office of Regional \nEconomic Integration, in collaboration with ISEAS. The TA is expected to commence in August \n2010, and be completed by May 2012.  \n \n20.  The TA will require one international principal consultant for 12 person-months, six \ninternational  trade  economists  for  12  person-months,  three  international  trade  lawyers  for  \n6 person-months, an infrastructure consultant for 2 person-months, and a social development \nconsultant for 2 person-months. The TA will also require 5 person-months of national consulting \ninputs. ADB will recruit the international consultants through single-source selection of a firm, in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime).  \n \n21.  ISEAS, the firm being considered for this TA, is uniquely qualified for the planned scope \nof work, given its expertise in the ASEAN region. The primary focus of ISEAS and its work \nprogram is on ASEAN countries, including AEC-related research and policy work. ISEAS is the \nonly institution in Asia with expertise required in ASEAN matters to undertake the kind of \nspecialized and detailed work associated with the realization of the ASEAN AEC. It houses the \nASEAN Center, which is headed by Rodolfo Severino, a former secretary-general of the ASEAN \nSecretariat. ISEAS is intimately familiar with the ASEAN Charter and ASEAN\u2019s organizational \nstructure and framework in general and the AEC Blueprint in particular, including its action plans \nand  target  dates  for  the  accomplishment  of  the  AEC.  In  addition,  ISEAS  has  a  thorough \nunderstanding of and experience in research relating to the accelerated realization of the AEC \nby the target date of 2015.  \n \n22.  ISEAS will provide 34 person-months of international consulting services for the TA, \nwhich will cost approximately $340,000, covering remuneration, travel, and per diem.   \n \n23,  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nAssessment  of  Impediments  and  Actions  Required  for  Achieving  an  ASEAN  Economic \nCommunity by 2015, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance     \n  Targets and/or  Data Sources and/or   \nDesign Summary  Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nAccelerated process  Increased  ASEAN database on  Effective collaboration with the \nof ASEAN economic  intraregional trade  trade and investment,  ASEAN Secretariat and ASEAN \nintegration  and investment  International Monetary  member countries  \n  Fund\u2019s Direction of Trade   \nStatistics, United Nations  Risk \nConference on Trade and  Lack of political commitment of \nDevelopment, Trade  ASEAN member countries \nStatistics, World Bank\u2019s \nDoing Business  \nOutcome      Assumption \nTimely achievement of  Approved policy  Reports of ASEAN senior  Effective collaboration with the \nthe AEC   recommendations by  economic officials  ASEAN Secretariat and ASEAN \nASEAN member  meeting, ASEAN  member countries \ncountries  economic ministers   \nmeeting  Risk \nLack of political commitment of \nASEAN member countries \nOutputs       Assumptions \n(i)  12 background  Quality background  Reports of ASEAN senior  Effective collaboration with the \nstudies  papers   officials meeting, ASEAN  ASEAN Secretariat and ASEAN \n(ii)  3\u20134 business  Quality business and  economic ministers  member countries  \nsurveys   perception surveys  meeting   \n(iii) 1 perception    Timely recruitment of consultants \nsurvey      \n(iv) Final publication  Quality publication  Risk \n(v)  Inception, review,    Lack of political commitment of \nand dissemination  ASEAN member countries \nworkshops \n \nActivities with Milestones: August 2010\u2013April 2012  Inputs \n1.1.
