THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) grant to Solomon Islands for the Transport Sector Project Development \nFacility. \n \n2.  The  proposed  facility  will  support  the  government  to  improve  the  design  and \nimplementation readiness of priority transport projects in the roads, maritime, and aviation sectors \nby (i) preparing feasibility studies and detailed designs; (ii) providing implementation support for \nprocurement,  social,  and  environmental  safeguards  activities  at  the  early  stage  of  project \nimplementation; and (iii) supporting capacity building of key implementing agencies.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Solomon Islands is an archipelago with six large islands, dozens of smaller islands, and \nhundreds of islets and atolls. The country relies heavily on intermodal transport to connect its \npopulation with essential goods and services. About 85% of the population is dispersed across \nrural  and  often  remote  villages.  Given  its  dispersed  geography,  the  development  and \nmanagement of a reliable, appropriate, sustainable, and affordable transport system is critical for \nsustaining economic growth. An effective transport sector provides access to essential goods and \nservices and helps create livelihood opportunities. However, Solomon Islands still lacks transport \nservices and facilities. This restricts economic activity and negatively affects livelihoods and \nincome-generating opportunities. The country\u2019s economic potential\u2014particularly from agriculture \nand tourism\u2014remains unrealized. In addition, Solomon Islands is ranked sixth in the world for \nbeing at risk from disasters caused by extreme natural events such as cyclones, floods, storm \nsurges, earthquakes, tsunamis, and droughts.1 These factors emphasize the need for integrated \nand climate-resilient marine, land, and air transport connectivity to drive sustainable and inclusive \neconomic development. \n \n 4.  Solomon  Islands\u2019  National  Development  Strategy  (NDS)  provides  a  framework  for \nsustained and inclusive growth.2 It highlights the need to expand and upgrade weather-resilient \ninfrastructure and utilities focused on access to productive resources, markets, and essential \nservices. As a key measure for achieving equitable socio-economic growth by 2020, the NDS \ntargets to provide at least 30% of Solomon Islands\u2019 rural population with access to essential \nservices through improved transport.  \n \n5.   The National Transport Plan (NTP) outlines Solomon Islands\u2019 policies, priorities, and plans \nfor  improving  transport  infrastructure  and  services  in  line  with  the  NDS.3 The  Ministry  of \nInfrastructure Development (MID) updated the 2010 NTP in 2016 to cover 2017\u20132036, and the \nupdated plan highlights 260 priority construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance projects. The \nMedium-Term Transport Action Plan (MTTAP) of the NTP sets out priority investments for the \nprojects identified in the NTP, covering 2017\u20132021. The total investment needs for construction \nand  rehabilitation  works  under  the  MTTAP  are  about  $280  million,  and  corresponding \nmaintenance works are estimated to be $90 million. \n \n                                                \n1  B\u00fcndnis Entwicklung Hilft, 2017.

Solomon Islands National Transport Plan, 2017\u20132036. Honiara.   ", "2 \n6.  In 2009, the Government of Solomon Islands established the National Transport Fund \n(NTF) under the MID to help finance the rehabilitation and maintenance of transport assets. The \nestablishment of the NTF has led to increased government and development partner contributions \nto the transport sector. About 87% of its funds (SI$313 million) during 2011\u20132016 were allocated \nto maintenance works. As a result, the length of all roads under regular maintenance increased \nfrom 20% in 2011 to 42% in 2016. The MID\u2019s capacity for planning and maintenance of transport \ninfrastructure has also improved over the years with TA support from various development \npartners. \n \n7.  To  help  achieve  NTP  targets,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the \nSustainable Transport Infrastructure Improvement Program (STIIP) in 2016.4 It is a $78 million \nprogram, jointly financed by ADB and the Governments of Australia and Solomon Islands to \nsupport the implementation of the road and maritime projects prioritized by the MTTAP and \nfinanced through the NTF. The country\u2019s procurement and public financial management systems \nwere adopted for the program. About 46% ($36 million) of the project\u2019s budget is allocated to \ninvestments to construct and rehabilitate assets, while the balance of 54% ($42 million) is \nallocated to maintenance for 2017\u20132021. \n \n8.  Key lessons from completed and ongoing ADB-funded projects show that significant delays \noccur at the project start-up stage after ADB\u2019s loan or grant approval. This particularly applies to \npreparing detailed designs, updating and implementing social and environmental safeguards \nassessments prepared at feasibility stage, and procurement activities (preconstruction activities). \nOf all the ADB funded transport sector projects that financially closed in Solomon Islands during \n2010\u20132013, an average of only 30% disbursement had been achieved after 65% of the project\u2019s \nelapsed time while transport sector projects that financially closed during 2013\u20132015 received an \naverage time extension of 100%, equivalent to about 3 years.5 This is attributable to weak \ntechnical capacity to comply with ADB\u2019s safeguard and procurement requirements and insufficient \nfunding within the transport agencies including the MID, the Ministry of Communication and \nAviation (MCA), and the Solomon Islands Ports Authority (SIPA) to finance detailed designs and \nundertake these activities prior to loan or grant effectiveness.  \n \n9.  Most of the projects faced issues in securing land after ADB Board approval because of \ninadequate time and resources allocated prior to project approval for community consultation and \nconsent. This resulted in significant implementation delays because of land disputes. Completing \ndetailed designs and preparing bidding documents takes more than 1 year after project approval, \ndelaying mobilization of contractors at the site. Cost and time overruns were common as cost \nestimates at project approval were not based on detailed designs.  \n  \n10.  The lack of project readiness has resulted in underinvestment in the transport sector, which \nhas led to the degradation of key assets. Out of Solomon Islands\u2019 total road network (1,545 \nkilometers [km]), only 67% (1,035 km) is in maintainable condition while the rest needs substantial \nrehabilitation to become maintainable.6 Similarly, out of the 91 domestic wharves, only 46 are in \nmaintainable condition, and two international and associated domestic wharves require major \nrehabilitation. In the aviation segment, only six out of 22 airfields have regular flights, and the \ninfrastructure of domestic airports is in poor condition. Projects under the MTTAP will improve the \ncondition of assets across the transport sector; however, there is no single mechanism to examine \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2016.

These activities are crucial to \nensure proper investment planning, and to prepare the subprojects for financing. \n \n11.  The facility and ensuing projects will complement the STIIP. About 54% of the funds in the \nprogram are allocated through the NTF to maintain roads and wharves as the prime focus of the \nNTF. The rest of the funds are allocated to small-scale investments. Consistent with ADB\u2019s policy \non results-based lending and the policies of the Government of Solomon Islands, the STIIP does \nnot cover projects with large-value contracts and those with significant environmental and social \nimpacts. In addition, the program does not cover the aviation segment or international wharves \nand associated domestic wharves under the SIPA. As a result, a significant portion of the projects \nslated for implementation under the MTTAP still requires complementary arrangements for design \nand implementation. The facility and associated projects will fill this gap.   \n \n12.  In summary, low project readiness has caused long delays in project implementation, cost \nand time overruns, and suboptimal quality of project designs  which fall short of  achieving \ndevelopment  outcomes.  Continuing  to  follow  the  same  approach  could  prevent  successful \nimplementation of the MTTAP as there are very few projects developed for project funding. There \nis a risk of not achieving the sustainable and inclusive growth targets of the NTP and NDS. \n \n13.   Value  added  by  ADB  assistance.  Given  the  government\u2019s  sector-wide  approach \nestablished through the NTP, transport sector institutions need to be equipped with the capacity \nto carry out preconstruction activities efficiently. Successful project implementation requires \ntimely, high-quality preparation works to comply with the development partners\u2019 requirements for \nproject processing and to avoid any delays. A readily accessible project development facility will \nallow easy access by transport sector institutions including the MID, SIPA, and MCA to conduct \npreconstruction activities efficiently and on time. \n \n14.   The facility aims to ensure (i) design readiness by supporting the government in preparing \nfeasibility studies (including environmental and social assessments, resettlement plans, and \neconomic analysis) and detailed designs; and (ii) project implementation readiness by supporting \nproject start-up during the inception stage with selection of supervision consultants; compliance \nwith social and environmental safeguards requirements; and procurement activities including bid \npreparation, evaluation, and contract negotiations. The facility will also support the technical \ncapacity building for the key implementing agency: the MID and its central project implementation \nunit (CPIU). \n \n15.  The proposed facility will help prepare a high-priority project pipeline not covered under the \nSTIIP and will thereby complement that program. The NTF can also fund projects developed \nunder the facility depending on the social and environmental impacts, size, and nature of the \nprocurement. Improving project start-up is important for complying with the requirements of \ndevelopment partners (to avoid delays in project financing) and ensuring continued efficiency over \nthe project\u2019s life cycle. Furthermore, demonstrating implementation effectiveness is essential for \nbuilding the confidence of development partners and increasing investments in the transport \nsector. A summary of transport sector assessment and development coordination in the sector is \nin the linked documents.7 \n \n                                                \n7 Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport and Development Coordination are accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "4 \n16.  The facility is aligned with the government\u2019s NTP and NDS. It is also consistent with the \ncurrent ADB country partnership strategy.8 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n17.  The facility is aligned with the following impact: All Solomon Islanders have access to \nessential services and productive resources and markets. It will have the following outcome: The \nreadiness of the priority transport projects in the MTTAP for funding is improved.9 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n18.  Output 1: Feasibility studies and detailed designs completed for selected priority \nprojects. The facility will support the preparation of roads, selected domestic wharves, and \ninternational ports projects. Feasibility studies are already ongoing under ADB's regional TA \nprograms for Guadalcanal roads and ports.10 These will be prioritized as the first batch of projects \nfor developing detailed designs and preparing safeguards and procurement documents. \n \n19.  Output 2: Initial implementation for new transport projects is supported. The facility \nwill provide implementation support at the project start-up stage for (i) safeguard compliance \nactivities including signing of memoranda of understanding with landowners, land acquisitions, or \nresettlement activities if required; and (ii) procurement activities, including preparation of bid \ndocuments, bid evaluation, and contract negotiations. \n \n20.   Output  3.  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  Development\u2019s  capacity  in  design  review, \ncontract supervision, and quality assurance strengthened. The facility will support the MID \nto strengthen its technical design unit within the CPIU. In addition, MID\u2019s technical skills in road \nconstruction supervision and quality assurance and control will be increased. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n21.  The estimated project cost is $6.96 million. The facility will finance consulting services for \nproject preparatory activities and capacity development, taxes and duties, contingencies, and \nproject management costs (Table 1).

MID will recruit a consulting firm to undertake feasibility studies, detailed designs, and \nprocurement activities including preparation of bid documents for subprojects. MID will also recruit \nindividual consultants or a consulting firm to support the government to review the feasibility \nstudies and detailed designs prepared by the firm, and to supplement the contract management \n ", "7 \nand quality assurance and control. The government has requested ADB to carry out consultant \nselection on its behalf to avoid start-up delays. ADB has agreed to jointly select consultants based \non an agreed responsibility matrix. The government will retain its responsibility for contract \nnegotiation and contract signing through the MID (footnote 11). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n28.  All transport sector investments to be prepared under the facility should be in line with (i) \nthe government\u2019s NDS, NTP, or any subsector master plan; and (ii) ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan.12 Investment projects in the preliminary list are the government\u2019s priority projects \nin the road and maritime subsectors. The terms of reference for consulting firms that will be \nengaged under the facility will cover technical aspects such as engineering design, safety, climate \nchange mitigation and adaptation, and gender-responsive design features. In addition to standard \ntechnical solutions, the consultants will provide innovative approaches in infrastructure design \nand specifications that will consider the availability of local knowledge and materials and adapt \nthe tested expertise to local conditions for better climate resilience and sustainability.13  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n29.   Through the facility, the project facility will support the government in preparing feasibility \nstudies and detailed designs and will assist the implementing agencies in procurement and \nsafeguard implementation. The facility will enhance the project readiness of pipeline projects, and \nin turn will minimize existing delays between preconstruction activities and civil works. Increased \nproject readiness will reduce the opportunity cost of funds that may otherwise remain unutilized \nafter project approval, by allowing them to be used for other investment projects. The terms of \nreference for consulting services include carrying out economic and financial assessments in \naccordance with the related policies and guidelines of the government and ADB\u2019s 2017 Guidelines \non the Economic Analysis of Projects, and ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Financial Management and \nAnalysis  of  Projects  (2005). 14  These  assessments  will  help  the  government  formulate \neconomically and financially viable investment projects. \n \n30.   The investment projects prepared under the facility will support the overall economic \ngrowth of Solomon Islands by (i) reducing the transport costs to regional and domestic markets, \n(ii) connecting communities with broad economic and social activities, and (iii) promoting tourism. \nThe selected projects ranked highly on the NTP, which follows the scoring criteria used for the \n2013 National Infrastructure Investment Plan.15 These scoring criteria include sustainable and \ninclusive economic growth and poverty alleviation indicators. In addition, the facility will support \nHoniara and Noro ports if the economic and financial viability is established from the feasibility \nstudies undertaken by the ongoing ADB regional TA.16  \n \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2017. 11 Small Pacific Island Countries, 2018\u20132020.

Only consulting services (firm or firms, and \nindividual consultants) will be recruited under the facility. All consultants will be recruited in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time) \nand Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). ADB will \nselect the consultants, and the implementing agency will negotiate with and contract the selected \nconsultants (para. 27). Consultants will submit reports to the implementing agency and ADB, in \nline with the agreed submission milestones during implementation, to ensure the quality and \ntimeliness of the consultants' work. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  The facility is not expected to have any adverse social impacts and will prepare follow-on \nprojects in compliance with ADB's Handbook for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Projects \nand Handbook on Social Analysis: A Working Document.17 The facility will assess gender, labor, \nHIV/AIDS, and other social risks related to follow-on projects, and prepare a mitigation plan under \nthe facility to address these risks. \n \n35.  The project is proposed as having some gender elements. The facility will ensure that \nthere will be at least 40% women and vulnerable groups participating in consultations and \nmeetings during due diligence.18 The facility will ensure that (i) separate meetings will be held with \nwomen to ensure their open and meaningful participation, particularly in assessing their different \ndemands and need for transport (ii) poverty, social, and gender assessments will be undertaken \nin each of the projects to identify (a) the constraints and challenges facing women in accessing \ntransportation and the economic and social impacts; and (b) gender differences in travel, transport \nmode, poverty, mobility and safety, among others. The government will incorporate the outcomes \nof the poverty, social, and gender assessments in the design of all ensuing investments. The \nfacility will prepare the Gender Action Plan for at least two of these projects.  \n \n                                                \n17 ADB. 1994.

Safeguards \n \n36.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the facility is categorized C \nfor environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people\u2019s safeguards.19 The proposed \nfacility will support the development of environmentally and socially viable investment projects. \nThe facility is not expected to have any adverse involuntary resettlement or environmental impacts \nbecause it is focused on preparing investment projects and will not involve construction work. \nProjects under the facility will each be assessed for safeguards in accordance with ADB's \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  government  guidelines,  regulations,  and  policies \nincluding the MID\u2019s Safeguards Procedures Manual. During the feasibility studies, the consultants \nwill  prepare  environmental  impact  assessments  or  initial  environmental  examinations  as \napplicable,  including  environmental  management  plans  and  climate  risk  and  vulnerability \nassessments for the selected transport projects. At this stage, consultants will develop the \nresettlement framework, indigenous peoples plan framework and/or resettlement plans, and \nindigenous people\u2019s plans. Safeguards preparatory activities will also include consultations and \nsigning of memoranda of understanding with the landowners that will confirm their support for the \nproject and willingness to comply with ADB safeguards and pertinent government policies. The \nfacility will also support IAs\u2019 to build safeguards capacity.  \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n37.
