May 2003. Sri Lanka Assessment of Conflict-related Needs in the Districts of Jaffna, \nKilinochchi,  Mullaitivu,  Mannar,  Vavuniya,  Trincomalee,  Batticaloa,  and  Ampara, \nPrepared with the support of Asian Development Bank, United Nations and World Bank, \nSri Lanka.  \n  ", "  iii\nLOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY \n \nBorrower  Sri Lanka \n   \nClassification  Primary: Poverty Intervention \nSecondary: Human Resource Development \n   \nEnvironment  Category B. The Project involves small-scale civil and building works at \nAssessment  sites previously or currently used for the same or similar purposes and is \nnot  likely  to  generate  any  significant  environmental  impact.  All \nsubprojects will be required to complete and satisfy an environmental \nchecklist during formulation.  \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  contributes  to  the  Government\u2019s  overall  relief  and \nrehabilitation program for the conflict-affected areas of the Northern and \nEastern provinces, which make up almost one third of Sri Lanka\u2019s area \nand contain about 10% of its total population. The Project will focus on \nessential economic and social infrastructure and address basic needs in \nthe  conflict-affected  areas  through  health,  education,  agriculture, \ncommunity, and income generation subprojects. Restoration activities \nwill focus on medium-scale subprojects designed to bridge community \ndevelopment with broader district-level improvements.  \n   \nRationale  For nearly 20 years, the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka \nserved as the theater for the conflict between the Government\u2019s armed \nforces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), leaving over \n65,000  dead,  several  times  as  many  people  disabled,  and  nearly \n800,000 people displaced from their homes. On 22 February 2002, the \nGovernment  and  the  LTTE  signed  a  cease-fire  agreement,  thereby \ncommencing the long process of ending the conflict and beginning a \nperiod of reconciliation and restoration. Although only in effect for 2 \nyears, the cease-fire has brought a measure of normalcy to the country, \nand, in particular, to the North East. However, the vast majority of people \ndirectly  affected  by  the  conflict  still  suffer  from  a  lack  of  basic \ninfrastructure and social services.  \n \n  The operations of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the conflict-\naffected areas began well before the cease-fire agreement through Loan \n1846\u2013SRI(SF):  North  East  Community  Restoration  and  Development \n(NECORD) Project. The NECORD Project is now improving the well-\nbeing of people affected by the 20-year long conflict in the North East by \nproviding  basic  services  for  those  affected  by  the  conflict,  restoring \nhealth  and  education  facilities,  reestablishing  agricultural  and  fishing \nactivities as a means of providing incomes, and mobilizing communities \nto become involved in implementing project-financed activities.  \n ", "iv   \n  A needs assessment, which was presented to international aid agencies \nat the Sri Lanka Reconstruction and Development Conference held in \nTokyo  in  June  2003,  identified  immediate  and  medium-term \nrehabilitation  needs  across  all  sectors,  costing  about  $1.9 billion,  of \nwhich about $700 million was required immediately. The Conference, \nthrough  the  Tokyo  Declaration,  also  agreed  that  assistance  by  the \ninternational  aid  agencies  must  be  closely  linked  to  substantial  and \nparallel  progress  in  the  peace  process.  About  $550 million  and \n$194 million  have  been  committed  by  the  multilateral  and  bilateral \nagencies, respectively, through ongoing and planned projects. However, \nthe present commitments account for only 35% of the total immediate \nneeds,  with  significantly  less  commitment  toward  the  restoration  of \nessential physical and social infrastructure. Resumption of economic life \nand  reestablishment  of  livelihoods  rely  on  rehabilitation  of  key \ninfrastructure facilities and community restoration.  \n \n  Recognizing that the conditions in the North East are the aftermath of 20 \nyears  of  conflict  and  have  resulted  in  a  situation  where  needs  that \nrequire urgent attention greatly exceed available resources, the Project \nhas been processed under ADB\u2019s emergency rehabilitation procedures. \nThe  Project  follows  the  ongoing  NECORD  Project,  and  adopts  that \nproject\u2019s sector loan approach. The Project will reinforce the perception \nthat the international community remains involved with and is supporting \nthe  peace  process,  and  will  also  confirm  ADB\u2019s  leading  role  in \nrehabilitation  and  peace  support  operations  in  the  country\u2019s  most \nimpoverished and vulnerable region.  \n   \nObjectives and  The objective of the Project is to rapidly improve the living conditions \nScope  and well-being of the significant number of people in the areas badly \naffected by the conflict, particularly in the North East. The purpose is to \nrestore basic social infrastructure and community service needs in these \nareas.  The  Project  will  support  and  augment  the  Government\u2019s \nrehabilitation and relief efforts already under way through the existing \nNECORD Project.  \n \n  The Project will focus on the highest priority sectors and areas for which \nADB assistance is most appropriate, based on the needs assessment \nand reflecting consultations with the Government, development partners, \nthe LTTE, communities, nongovernment organizations, and others. The \nProject  is  being  prepared  and  will  be  implemented  using  a  sector \napproach, through which subprojects will be selected on the basis of \nagreed  general  and  sector-specific  criteria.  The  Project  will  address \nbasic  needs  in  the  conflict-affected  areas  through  health,  education, \nagriculture,  income-generation  capacity  building,  and  social  cohesion \nsubprojects. Subprojects in each of these sectors will be selected and \nformulated in response to requests from conflict-affected persons and \nthe Government. \n \n  ", "  v\n  Representative  subprojects  proposed  for  implementation  under  the \nProject include the reconstruction of the Chavakacheri Hospital, Jaffna \ndistrict;  rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  the  Vavuniya  General  and \nMannar  Base  hospitals;  reconstruction  of  the  Kilinochchi  Central \nCollege,  destroyed  in  the  conflict;  provision  of  cluster-housing \ncompounds  for  teachers  in  remote  areas;  construction  of  a  cultural \ncenter in Vavuniya, to assist in reconciliation of the area\u2019s three ethnic \ncommunities; livestock development and agriculture extension services; \nskills development and training programs; and a prototype program to \ndevelop a women\u2019s enterprise initiative, for wider-scale use on follow-on \nprojects in the north and east.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The estimated total cost is $14.3 million equivalent, inclusive of taxes, \nduties, and interest during implementation.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total   \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost  % \nADB  5.5  4.5  10.0  70 \nGovernment  0.0  4.3   4.3  30 \nTotal 5.5  8.8  14.3  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nLoan Amount and  The Government has requested a loan of $10 million equivalent from \nTerms  ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the Project.  The term of \nthe loan will be 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years, with \nrepayment of principal at 2% per year for the first 10 years after the \ngrace period and 4% a year thereafter, with an interest charge at the \nrate of 1% per annum.   \n   \nPeriod of  Until 30 June 2007 \nUtilization   \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government will serve as \nthe Executing Agency. The North East Provincial Council, under the \ndirection  of  the  chief  secretary,  will  be  the  implementing  agency \nresponsible for overall project coordination and implementation.  \n   ", "vi   \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented using the same process approach and \nArrangements  will follow the same implementation arrangements that are already in \nplace and that are working extremely well for NECORD, thereby allowing \nsignificant  additional  needs  to  be  met  quickly  and  effectively.  The \nGovernor of the Northern and Eastern provinces will coordinate activities \nbetween the civil and military authorities. A project management unit \n(PMU), operating in Trincomalee and headed by a project director, will \nmanage the Project on a day-to-day basis. The PMU will implement \nsubprojects  through  government  and  NECORD  structures  and \nprocedures at the provincial, district, and divisional levels. District PMUs \nestablished  in  each  district  under  NECORD  and  headed  by  deputy \nproject directors will be responsible for district-level project operations. A \nnational  project  coordinator  based  within  the  Ministry  of  Provincial \nCouncils and Local Government in Colombo will assist the PMU with the \nexecution  of  the  Project.  The  German  Government\u2019s  Deutsche \nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit has provided a team of \ninternational  and  domestic  specialists  to  assist  the  PMU  in \nadministration of NECORD. This assistance will continue through the \nNorth  East  Provincial  Council  in  areas  such  as  planning,  human \nresource  development,  and  monitoring,  and  will  be  available  to  the \nProject on a preferential basis.  \n   \nProcurement  Procurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement,  and  the  Government\u2019s  tender \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Local procurement will be the preferred \nmode  for  all  project  activities,  because  of  the  relatively  short \nimplementation  period,  the  small  size  of  contract  packages  (below \n$2.5 million), the wide geographic spread of the project sites, and the \nneed  for  local  awareness  of  security  and  other  frequently  changing \nmatters relevant to accessing the project area. Contracts with estimated \nvalues  less  than  $100,000  will  be  procured  under  local  competitive \nbidding using post-facto approval procedures.  \n \n  Equipment  and  materials  will  be  procured  under  international \ncompetitive bidding where the estimated cost is more than $500,000 \nequivalent,  by  international  shopping  where  the  estimated  cost  is \nbetween  $300,000  and  $500,000  equivalent,  and  through  local \nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB where the estimated cost is \n$300,000 equivalent or less. Minor items costing less than $100,000 \nequivalent may be procured through direct purchase.  \n   \n  ", "  vii\nConsulting  The existing consultants for NECORD, who are providing procurement \nServices  and contract management support, and training of domestic agencies, \nwill extend their services through direct selection to cover the additional \nrequirements  of  the  Project.  For  new  services,  primarily  for  the \npreparation of master plans and bid documents for larger subprojects, \nconsultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants. \nConsultants will be provided individually and through firms; quality and \ncost-based  selection  procedures  will  be  used  in  the  recruitment  of \nconsulting firms. Individual consultants will also be fielded to assist in the \npreparation  of  gender-oriented  economic  activities  and  business \ncooperatives. The Project will require approximately 350 person-months \nof domestic consulting services.  \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2006 \nCompletion Date \n   \nProject Benefits  The  conflict-affected  areas  suffer  from  poverty  levels\u2014estimated  to \nand Beneficiaries  range from 60% to 90%\u2014that are much higher than in the rest of the \ncountry. Little of the social or economic infrastructure remains intact; \nmuch  of  what  remains  has  long  passed  its  useful  life.  Until  the \ninfrastructure is restored, at least marginally, there is little opportunity for \nthe restoration of livelihoods.  \n \n  The Project will benefit a significant proportion of the nearly 800,000 \npeople who were forced to relocate because of the conflict\u2014and who \nare  now  returning  to  their  homes\u2014as  well  as  those  people  who \nremained  in  place  but  lost  access  to  basic  social  and  economic \ninfrastructure;  many  are  physically  disabled  people,  female-headed \nhouseholds, and children. Through the restoration of sectors that form \nthe backbone of the economy of the North East, the Project serves as a \nchannel  that  brings  about  normalcy  to  the  lives  of  the  affected \ncommunities  and  assists  in  stabilizing  the  economic  basis  of  those \naffected  by  the  conflict,  reducing  their  dependency  on  government \nsupport and securing a sustainable livelihood for them. The Project\u2019s \nhealth and education activities will start the long process of restoring the \nsocial indicators in the North East to preconflict levels. A significant \nportion of the Project will focus on providing employment, training, and a \nsense of ownership for people, who now lack most of the basic essential \nrequirements for a productive life. Specialized prototype programs will \nbe developed to address the plight of the high percentage of war widows \nin fishing communities.  \n   ", "viii  \nRisks and  The major risk is that the Project, through poor targeting and inadequate \nAssumptions  control and monitoring, will exacerbate the tensions that ultimately led to \nconflict. On condition that the beneficial outcomes are shared sufficiently \nequitably among the major ethnic groups and across the target area, the \nProject  is  not  expected  to  contribute  to  an  intensification  of  social \ntensions. The Project has been designed and will be implemented in a \nmanner to ensure that balances among ethnic groups and regions within \nthe project areas are carefully monitored and managed, and that there is \ntransparency and complete community ownership of project activities.  \n \n  Beyond just \u201cdoing no harm,\u201d the Project can potentially make a positive \ncontribution to the rebuilding of key infrastructure and help make existing \ninfrastructure more effective in strengthening the socioeconomic fabric of \nthe conflict-affected areas. The challenge will be in implementing these \nactivities in a conflict-sensitive manner.  \n \n  Finally,  reflecting  the  linkage  between  aid  agency  assistance  and \nprogress in the peace process, there is a risk that, if the peace process \nfalters, the Project\u2019s scope and schedule may require review. However, \ngiven  the  recently  restated  commitment  of  the  Government  and  the \nLTTE to resume peace talks, and the robustness of the peace process \nitself\u2014despite recent political and other uncertainties, the peace process \nremains intact and the cease-fire agreed to in 2002 continues to be \nobserved\u2014this risk is assessed to be small.  \n \n  ", "  ix\n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the North East Community Restoration and \nDevelopment (NECORD) - Extension Project. \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  For nearly 20 years, the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka served as the \ntheater for the conflict between the Government\u2019s armed forces and the Liberation Tigers of \nTamil Eelam (LTTE), leaving over 65,000 dead, several times as many people disabled, and \nnearly 800,000 people displaced from their homes. While all of Sri Lanka has suffered from the \nconsequences, the North East and the adjacent areas have borne the brunt of the conflict. On \n22 February 2002, the Government and the LTTE signed a cease-fire agreement, thereby \ncommencing the long process of ending the conflict and beginning a period of reconciliation and \nrestoration.  Although  only  in  effect  for  2  years,  the  cease-fire  has  brought  a  measure  of \nnormalcy to the country, and, in particular, to the North East. However, the vast majority of \npeople directly affected by the conflict still suffer from the lack of basic infrastructure and social \nservices.  \n \n3.  Since  the  cease-fire,  nearly  40%1  of  the  internally  displaced  persons  (IDPs)  and \nrefugees have returned to their places of origin, usually to find their villages devastated, and \nbasic infrastructure, such as access to health, schools, and community facilities, no longer \nfunctioning.  The  Government,  with  the  assistance  of  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies,  is \nproviding  some  assistance  to  the  returnees  through  its  Unified  Assistance  Scheme.  This \nassistance, which is essentially a small cash grant and food rations for a limited period, is \nsufficient only for the returnees to establish themselves. In addition, several agencies, including \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB), are helping with the substantial task of rehabilitating and \nreplacing essential infrastructure, to build confidence among the IDPs and the host communities \nthat suffered through the conflict.  \n \n4.  Although  the  conflict  has  yet  to  formally  end,  the  Government,  the  LTTE,  and  the \ninternational  community  clearly  recognize  the  need  to  continue  the  rehabilitation  and \ndevelopment efforts in the conflict-affected areas to reinforce the confidence in the ongoing \npeace process, and as a \u201cpeace dividend\u201d for the area\u2019s people and for the entire country. The \nmultilateral  agencies  operating  in  Sri  Lanka2  gave  substance  to  this  by  undertaking  a \ncomprehensive needs assessment of relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction needs for the \nconflict-affected areas, primarily in the eight districts that make up the North East and the areas \nof the four adjacent districts that have also been impacted by the conflict (see Map). The \nassessment,  which  was  presented  to  the  international  community  at  the  Sri  Lanka \nReconstruction and Development Conference held in Tokyo in June 2003,3 concluded that \nabout $3 billion would be required for relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction\u2014$2 billion for \nimmediate and medium-term needs (within 6 years) and $1 billion for longer-term needs. The \n                                                 \n1  As  per  the  statistical  summary  issued  by  Ministry  of  Rehabilitation,  Resettlement  and  Refugees  with  the \nassistance of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. \n2  United Nations organizations, World Bank, and ADB. \n3  Sri Lanka Assessment of Needs in the Conflict Affected Areas (May 2003) prepared by the Government of Sri \nLanka with support from ADB, United Nations, and World Bank (the \u201cneeds assessment\u201d). ", "2  \nConference, through the Tokyo Declaration issued at its conclusion, also agreed that assistance \nby international aid agencies must be closely linked to substantial and parallel progress in the \npeace process toward fulfillment of the objectives agreed upon by the Government and the \nLTTE at the previous conference held in Oslo in December 2002. To date, the international \ncommunity  has  committed  about  $645 million  in  assistance\u2014about  35%  of  the  immediate \nneeds\u2014mainly for relief and rehabilitation activities. Of this amount, ADB\u2019s contribution to date \nis $237 million,4 amounting to 11% of the identified immediate needs.  \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s  operations  in  the  conflict-affected  areas  began  well  before  the  cease-fire \nagreement,  when  the  conflict  was  most  intense,  through  Loan  1846\u2013SRI(SF):  North  East \nCommunity Restoration and Development (NECORD) Project. This multisector rehabilitation \nand reconstruction project was approved in October 2001 and began implementation in January \n2002. It operates in all eight districts, including areas under the control of the LTTE. To date, \nabout  500  subprojects,  primarily  for  rehabilitation  of  basic  infrastructure  and  restoration  of \ncommunities, have been approved for implementation, and about 200 have been successfully \ncompleted.  A  summary  of  the  NECORD  subprojects  by  sector  and  district  is  provided  in \nAppendix 1.  The  project  funding,  originally  $40 million  but  now  substantially  more  through \npostapproval  cofinancing,  is  fully  committed  and,  as  such,  no  further  subprojects  can  be \napproved for implementation under NECORD. Although NECORD has been very effective and \nhighly efficient to date, it can only address a fraction of the immediate rehabilitation needs.  \n \n6.  In recognition that the conditions in the North East are the aftermath of 20 years of \nconflict and have resulted in a situation where needs that require urgent attention greatly \nexceed available resources, the Project has been prepared under ADB\u2019s disaster rehabilitation \nprocedures as appropriate and in anticipation of ADB\u2019s forthcoming policy on disaster and \nemergency assistance being prepared during processing of the Project.5 The Project follows the \nongoing NECORD Project and other emergency lending projects, and for reasons of continuity \nand rapid response, adopts the lending terms, and process implementation approach of those \nprojects (see project framework in Appendix 2). This process has worked extremely well for \nNECORD and other emergency lending projects, thereby allowing significant additional needs to \nbe  met  quickly  and  effectively,  demonstrating  visible  and  effective  support  for  the  peace \nprocess.  The  Project  therefore  reinforces  the  perception  that  the  international  community \nremains involved with and is supporting the peace process, and will also confirm ADB\u2019s leading \nrole in rehabilitation and peace support operations in the country\u2019s most impoverished and \nvulnerable region. The project framework also identifies broad performance indicators to be \nused to monitor and evaluate project performance and attainment of benefits; with the sector \nloan and process implementation approach, detailed performance indicators will be developed \nduring the course of the Project.  \n \n7.  Because  the  Project  has  been  processed  under  ADB\u2019s  disaster  and  emergency \nassistance policy and will use a sector-style approach to approving projects for implementation, \neconomic analysis is not required. As for the original NECORD Project, investments will be \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2001.

Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n8.  The North East constitutes almost a third of Sri Lanka\u2019s land area, and is administratively \ndivided into eight districts.6 Although the LTTE controls the districts of Kilinochchi and Mullaittivu \ncompletely and exercises partial control in other districts, the Government\u2019s civil administration, \nother than the military, police, and the judiciary, is functioning in all eight districts. The North \nEast\u2019s preconflict population of about 2.1 million people is now reduced to significantly less than \n2 million. The conflict caused significant movements of population within all districts in the North \nEast and into the bordering districts. Since the cease-fire, it appears that the populations of \nJaffna, Mullaittivu, and Kilinochchi districts are increasing as displaced families return to their \nhomes, a process that occurs spontaneously and often results in significant deprivation as \nfamilies find that support is not available. In other districts, there is either a decrease due to \noutward IDP movement or stability in the population.  \n \n9.  The population of the North East has always been largely rural, with over 88% living \noutside the principal towns. Livelihoods mainly depend on agriculture, fishing, and subsistence \nfarming. During the conflict, much of the agricultural land became inaccessible, through direct \nconflict or because of land mines. Irrigation systems were either destroyed, or fell into disuse \nand now require extensive rehabilitation before being returned to service. Fishing was severely \nlimited, which had a serious impact on a region that once provided more than half of the \ncountry\u2019s  fresh  and  dried  fish.  Most  fishing  boats  and  many  fishing  facilities  (harbors,  ice \nfacilities, markets, etc.) were destroyed, and have not yet been replaced. Much of the region\u2019s \nphysical  infrastructure  and  the  means  of  production  was  damaged  or  destroyed,  or  has \ndeteriorated over time. Its replacement and rehabilitation are essential if economic life is to \nresume and normal livelihoods are to be reestablished.  \n \n10.  Since the cease-fire, rehabilitation of some of basic infrastructure has been undertaken \nwith the assistance of multilateral and bilateral agencies which, respectively, have committed \nabout  $550 million  and  $194 million,  as  detailed  in  Appendix 3,  and  through  ongoing  and \nplanned projects for 2003 and 2004. However, the present commitments account for only 35% \nof  the  total  immediate  needs,  most  of  which  provide  relief  and  target  the  restoration  of \nlivelihoods;  other  than  for  ADB-supported  programs,  there  has  been  significantly  less \ncommitment  toward  the  rehabilitation  and  restoration  of  essential  physical  and  social \ninfrastructure.  \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s  contribution  by  ongoing  and  committed  projects  is  $237 million.  The  most \nsignificant projects that contribute directly to the rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts are \nNECORD and Loans 2043/2044-SRI: Conflict Affected Areas Rehabilitation Project (CAARP). \nThe efficiency and development impact of the NECORD Project has encouraged bilateral and \nmultilateral agencies to complement the project by providing additional financial and technical \nresources for new or expanded activities, which to date amount to about $25 million. This \nadditional  funding\u2014approved  or  under  processing\u2014has  come  from  the  Netherlands  for \n                                                 \n6  Districts of Ampara, Batticaloa, Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Mullaittivu, Trincomalee, Vavuniya. A synopsis of \nthese districts is attached as Appendix 4.  ", "4  \neducation,  agriculture,  and  IDP  resettlement  grants;  Norway  and  Finland  for  the  crucial \nKilinochchi hospital; and the European Union for provincial and rural roads. In addition, the \nWorld Bank has made use of the project\u2019s management and financial systems to channel \n$15 million in resettlement grants to about 57,000 IDP families.  \n \nC.  Lessons Learned \n \n12.  The NECORD Project is recognized for (i) its preparedness to respond quickly and \nflexibly; (ii) its focus on restoring facilities; (iii) ADB\u2019s supervision during implementation, as the \nproject places a heavy burden on executing agency and implementing agency (IA) staff; and \n(iv) support through equally rapid action by the Government. Lessons learned from NECORD \naffirm  that  (i) beneficiary  participation  must  be  ensured  during  project  preparation  and \nimplementation;  (ii) environment  and  social  aspects  should  be  considered  during  project \nimplementation, even though the need for rapid response may not permit a detailed treatment of \nthese issues prior to the approval of the assistance; (iii) arrangements for disbursements should \ngive ready and uncomplicated access to funds; (iv) focusing on physical infrastructure alone \nreduces the project value, therefore broader issues of assisting communities with regaining a \nproductive life should be included; (v) the adopted approach should permit flexible adjustment of \nproject design during implementation, as security and IDP movements require; (vi) criteria for \nsubproject selection should permit simple prioritization and short implementation periods but \nmust  ensure  a  balance  among  communities  and  maximum  benefits  for  the  community; \n(vii) there is a need for close and frequent monitoring to ensure transparency and facilitate \nimplementation; and (viii) there is a need to coordinate the large number of government and \nexternally assisted rehabilitation programs in the affected areas. The Project, which will be \nimplemented through the administrative systems established and operating under NECORD, \nhas been carefully formulated to reflect each of these lessons learned. In addition, reflecting a \nlesson learned from the close international aid agency coordination in rehabilitation programs, \nand the need to provide a linkage between aid agency assistance and the peace process, the \nProject will be implemented within the framework of the Tokyo Declaration (para. 4).  \n \nD.  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s Strategy \n \n13.  The Project was formulated during the midterm review of NECORD, which undertook a \nreview of all requirements and safeguard policies also applicable to the Project at that time. The \nProject is in line with the Government\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy,7 which recognizes that \npeace is the key to reducing conflict-related poverty; peace is one of the six pillars of the \nstrategy. The Government's policy on relief and rehabilitation aims to bring the population \naffected  by  the  conflict  back  to  productive  life  by  providing  basic  amenities  to  create  a \nphysically, economically, and socially sustainable environment for their reintegration. Also the \nProject is in line with the Poverty Partnership Agreement8 between the Government and ADB, \nwhich states that ADB will assist in addressing conflict-related poverty. The Country Strategy \nand Program for Sri Lanka 2004\u201320089 supports the Government's efforts in rehabilitating and \nreconstructing the conflict-affected areas. During the Tokyo Conference in June 2003, ADB \nagain  declared  its  commitment  to  provide  peace-enhancing  assistance  to  Sri  Lanka.  The \nproposed Project, which is based on the needs assessment and on wide consultation with the \n                                                 \n7  Government of Sri Lanka 2002.

The goal of the Project is to rapidly improve the living conditions and well-being of the \nsignificant number of people in the areas badly affected by the conflict, particularly in the eight \ndistricts of the North East. The purpose is to restore basic social infrastructure and community \nservice  needs  in  these  areas.  The  Project  will  support  and  augment  the  Government\u2019s \nrehabilitation and relief efforts already under way in the existing NECORD Project.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n15.  The  Project  will  address  basic  needs  in  the  conflict-affected  areas  through  health, \neducation, agriculture, community, and income generation subprojects. Subprojects in each of \nthese sectors will be selected and formulated in response to requests from conflict-affected \npersons and the Government. Restoration activities will focus on medium-scale subprojects \ndesigned to bridge community development with broader district-level improvements. For these \ntypes and scale of subprojects, land mine and unexploded ordnance contamination is not \nexpected to be substantial; many proposed subproject sites, which were destroyed during the \nconflict, have already been cleared. However, provisions for obtaining clearance certification of \nsubproject sites will be incorporated into each civil works contract. A list of potential subprojects \nis presented in Appendix 5.  \n \n1.  Health \n \n16.  The  health  sector  component  will  include  replacement  and  rehabilitation  of  health \nfacilities and hospitals destroyed or in serious disrepair. During preparation of NECORD, a \ndetailed analysis of the health system in the North East was undertaken, which identified a list of \nhospital  and  health  centers  requiring  reconstruction  and  refurbishment.  In  most  instances, \nparticularly for larger medical facilities, master plans had to be prepared prior to construction. As \na result, and due to needs exceeding available resources under the NECORD project, several \nof  these  key  health  facilities  still  require  rehabilitation.  The  project  scope  of  health  sector \nactivities  will  include  the  restoration  of  critical  referral  medical  facilities  through  hospital \nreconstruction  and  refurbishment,  provision  and  replacement  of  medical  equipment  and \nfurniture, construction of doctors\u2019 quarters at hospital compounds, and rehabilitation of village \nhealth  clinics.  Although  hospital  staffing  is  generally  satisfactory,  an  essential  subproject \nselection criterion will stipulate sufficient availability of qualified staff to operate the rehabilitated \nfacilities (as well as other existing facilities). Representative health sector subprojects proposed \nfor implementation under the Project include (i) the reconstruction of the Chavakacheri Hospital, \nJaffna  district;  (ii) rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  the  Vavuniya  General  and  Mannar  Base \nhospitals; and (iii) rehabilitation of outpatient development wards in Batticaloa and at the Maha-\noya Base Hospital, Ampara district.  \n \n2.  Education \n \n17.  Subprojects in the education component will restore education services and facilities \nthrough (i) the reconstruction and rehabilitation of teaching facilities and school buildings serving ", "6  \na large population area, (ii) construction of cluster-housing units for teachers in areas where \nexisting housing is limited or unavailable, and (iii) provision of English-language training to \nexisting  teachers.  The  cluster-housing  concept  reflects  a  lesson  learned  from  the  original \nNECORD project education component. Schools would only be rehabilitated if teachers were \navailable. Typically they were available, in the sense of being assigned to schools. However, the \nabsence of accommodation in the more remote areas, since most housing had been destroyed, \nmeant that their attendance was irregular. Since this problem did not arise wherever housing \nwas available, the Project will address this problem by providing simple cluster housing where \nno suitable accommodation is available. Addressing these needs, including the housing issue, \nwill help make schooling a continual and rewarding experience for students and enable them to \nmake up for previous education opportunities lost.  \n \n3.  Income Generation, Capacity Building, and Social Cohesion \n \n18.  This combined component of the Project will address several sectors through a variety of \nsubprojects that restore livelihoods, provide opportunities for income generation, and support \nreconciliation and social cohesion. Livelihood opportunities will be provided in the agricultural \nand  fisheries  sectors  through  subprojects  that  promote  livestock  development  and  market \ngardening, provide facilities for seed production, and establish inland aquaculture and fish-\nbreeding programs. A master plan for phased construction will be prepared to reestablish the \nfaculty  of  agriculture  of  the  University  of  Jaffna  in  Kilinochchi,  subject  to  further  review \nconfirming availability of staff and operation and maintenance funding. Construction of key \ncomponents, including provision for student and faculty housing, will promote education and \ntraining in the agriculture sector. Restoration of district agriculture centers will help assist rural \nfarmers.  Skills  development  and  service  training  will  also  be  provided  for  microenterprise \ndevelopment in areas such as horticulture, postharvest food processing, and the tourism and \nhotel industry.  \n \n19.  Capacity building in the conflict-affected areas will be improved through subprojects that \nprovide staff quarters for government employees in areas where accommodations are difficult to \nfind or unavailable. Adequate housing will attract and retain greater numbers of quality staff into \nthe North East, particularly into the areas hardest hit by the conflict.  \n \n20.  As an example of the Project\u2019s focus on reconciliation, the cultural hall in Vavuniya\u2014\nstrategically situated at the crossroads of the north and east\u2014will be restored. Although the cost \nis small, the facility and others like it will assist in reconciliation of the area\u2019s three ethnic \ncommunities and will provide residents and visitors with the opportunity to celebrate their culture \nand traditions away from reminders of the conflict.  \n \n21.  The conflict also left a high percentage of female-headed households, particularly in \nfishing and agricultural communities. Specific training programs will focus on female-headed \nhouseholds in these areas. In addition, prototype programs will be developed to guide and \nassist  vulnerable  women\u2019s  group\u2019s,  such  as  fishers\u2019  war  widows  in  establishing  income \ngenerating enterprises, ancillary units, and cooperatives in a secure environment. Lessons \nlearned from these prototype programs will be applied on a larger scale in follow-on projects in \nthe North East.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n22.  The Project has been formulated to address especially urgent basic needs and social \nservices lost as a result of the 20-year conflict. Over the last two decades, the project area \n  ", "  7\nserved as a battleground of ethnic and communal tensions that led to the destruction of physical \nassets and erosion of human capacity. For a return to normal life in the area, social services \nmust  be  restored,  destroyed  infrastructure  must  be  rebuilt,  and  access  to  employment \nopportunities must be made available; the people must see a rapid and visible peace dividend \nas a reason not to return to conflict. The Project is therefore being processed and will be \nimplemented expeditiously. Under ADB\u2019s procedures for providing rehabilitation assistance after \ndisasters, guidelines can be flexibly interpreted in order to commence activities promptly. The \nprocedures  for  project  loan  processing,  procurement,  consultant  engagement,  subproject \nselection, and the type of works to be done reflect this flexibility, without sacrificing quality, \ntransparency, and safeguards. However, extra effort and time will be taken to provide proper \ntargeting and adequate subproject control and monitoring, to ensure community participation \nand to address area resource capacity constraints.  \n \n23.  The Project will introduce specific strategies to help change the perceptions and realities \nof women in the conflict-affected areas as victims and war widows. While seeking to reduce the \npoverty levels of women, the Project will also design specific measures to uplift the status of \nwomen  in  society.  Subprojects  will  be  developed  to  promote  the  advancement  of  women \nthrough economic activities that will empower them to control and manage their own resources \nin  a  sustainable  manner.  Case  studies  for  development  and  implementation  of  prototype \nprograms will be undertaken in two fishing areas that have a high number of female-headed \nhouseholds to help establish replicable women\u2019s industrial centers. Lessons learned from these \nprototype programs will be applied in follow-on projects in the North East for wider development \nof these women\u2019s industrial centers. Consultant guidance and assistance will be provided, first \nto assess and develop the programs, then to serve as catalysts for establishing the centers; \nbeneficiary women\u2019s groups themselves will undertake the majority of the work involved in the \nformation and establishment of these prototype centers. By providing a secure environment to \nconduct such activities, these pilot centers will also create an enabling environment to promote \nwomen\u2019s confidence and entrepreneurship. Thus, the Project will be instrumental in starting a \nprocess of uplifting the status of women in the conflict zones from positions of vulnerability to \nthat of economic independence and stability. The Project will build on existing networks, namely \nthe district women's rural development societies and involve the cooperation of women\u2019s NGOs \nto be identified at the implementation stage. The process of delivering the prototype programs is \noutlined in Appendix 6.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n24.  The total project cost is estimated at $14.3 million, comprising $5.5 million (38%) in \nforeign exchange and $8.8 million equivalent (62%) in local currency costs. A summary cost \nestimate is shown in Table 1.

Financing Plan \n \n25.  The Government has requested that ADB finance 70% of the cost of the activities to be \nundertaken  under  the  scope  of  the  Project  with  a  loan  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$10 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The Borrower will be Sri Lanka. Cofinancing\u2014\nto finance items such as equipment and furniture for medical or educational facilities\u2014is being \nsought and is expected to be provided during the course of the Project.10 The term of the loan \nwill be 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years, with repayment of principal at 2% per year \nfor the first 10 years after the grace period and 4% a year thereafter, to be paid semiannually, \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum. The Government will finance the remaining \ncost of $4.3 million (30% of total cost) in local currency, including taxes and duties.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local     \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  5.5  4.5  10.0  70 \nGovernment  0.0  4.3  4.3  30 \nTotal  5.5  8.8  14.3  100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n                                                 \n10  Cofinancing will similarly continue to be sought for NECORD, independently of the Project.  \n  ", "  9\nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n26.  The project management arrangements described here reflect the present government \nadministration structure in the North East, and may change during project implementation. The \nProject\u2019s loan agreement addresses this by referring to successor entities and arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \n27.  The Project will be implemented using the same process approach and follow the same \nimplementation arrangements already in place\u2014and working quite successfully\u2014on NECORD \nas described below: \n \n(i)  The Governor of the Northern and Eastern provinces will be the overall coordinator \nfor  the  Project,  in  particular  managing  the  critical  interaction  between  provincial \nauthorities and the security services.  \n \n(ii)  The Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government (MPCLG) or its successor \nentity, acceptable to ADB, will be the Executing Agency.  \n \n(iii)  The North East Provincial Council (NEPC) under direction of the chief secretary will \nbe the IA, acting through its provincial departments and agencies.  \n \n(iv)  The  National  Project  Coordination  Committee  (NPCC)  will  be  chaired  by  the \nsecretary of MPCLG and will include representatives of the ministries responsible for \nrehabilitation in the project area, as well as the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry \nof  Finance;  line  ministries  including  Health,  Education,  Agriculture;  the  project \ndirector; and others as appropriate. The chief secretary of NEPC will also be a \nmember of NPCC. ADB and the German Government\u2019s Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr \nTechnische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), which have provided a team of international and \ndomestic  specialists  to  assist  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  in  the \nadministration  of  NECORD,  will  be  represented  on  NPCC.  Among  other \nresponsibilities, NPCC will (a) review subprojects approved by the Provincial Project \nCoordination Committee (PPCC) ensuring that these comply with the subproject \nselection criteria, and are distributed appropriately among communities and areas; \n(b) monitor  overall  project  implementation;  (c) resolve  serious  implementation \nproblems,  in  particular  those  related  to  access  of  personnel,  equipment,  and \nmaterials into the project area; and (d) provide top level coordination with other \nnational  government  agencies  and  projects  involved  in  relief  and  rehabilitation. \nNPCC will meet as required, but at least quarterly.  \n \n(v)  PPCC will be chaired by the chief secretary of NEPC and will include the government \nagents for the districts making up the project area, representatives of the provincial \ndepartments relevant to the Project, the security forces, the project director, the \nleader  of  the  GTZ  management  team,  a  representative  of  ADB,  and  others  as \nappropriate. PPCC will meet on a regular basis, but not less than quarterly. Meetings \ngenerally will be held in Trincomalee, but from time to time in other district capitals. \nAmong other responsibilities, PPCC will (a) review and approve subprojects ensuring \nthat these are distributed appropriately among communities and areas; (b) monitor \nimplementation of the approved subprojects; (c) resolve implementation problems, in \nparticular those related to access of personnel, equipment, and materials into the ", "10  \nproject area; and (d) coordinate with other agencies and projects involved in relief \nand rehabilitation. \n \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that the existing PMU under NECORD established in \nTrincomalee will be appropriately strengthened and maintained for the duration of the \nProject to allow the PMU to perform its obligations under the Project. The PMU will \nbe headed by the project director, who will have direct responsibility for implementing \nthe Project, through the existing provincial and central government sector agencies, \nand for ensuring that the essential balances among communities are monitored and \nmaintained.  The  PMU  will  manage  and  coordinate  subprojects  through  existing \nstructures and procedures at the provincial, district, and division levels. PMU will act \nas the secretariat for NPCC and PPCC. The PMU may engage suitably qualified and \nacceptable international and domestic NGOs for management of specific activities in \nthe  Project  in  accordance  with  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  District  project \nmanagement units (DPMUs) established in each district under NECORD will closely \nmonitor the implementation of district subprojects and report to the PMU. A deputy \nproject director, who will directly implement smaller-scale subprojects at the district \nand divisional levels, will head each DPMU.  \n \n(vii)  District-level project organizations will make use of the existing structures of the \nGovernment to the extent possible, including district coordination committees. The \ngovernment agents will act as secretaries to these committees and provide initial \nscreening of subproject proposals prior to their submission to PMU and PPCC. The \nproject organization in each district will be headed by a deputy project director, and \nwill take direct responsibility for implementing the Project at the district and division \nlevels.  \n \n28.  The February 2004 midterm review of the NECORD Project confirmed that the PMU and \nthe  DPMUs  would  be  able  to  manage  the  additional  workload  at  current  staffing  levels. \nHowever,  given  the  likelihood  of  similar  follow-on  projects  and  the  potential  for  additional \nfunding for other external sources of assistance, the need may arise for additional project staff. \nThe Government agreed to provide the PMU and the IA with additional staff if required, as part \nof the Government\u2019s contribution to the Project.  \n \n29.  The scope of the GTZ-provided technical assistance was modified somewhat during the \nNECORD project midterm review; the technical assistance, which has been particularly effective \nfor the Community Development component of the NECORD Project, will provide wider support \nthrough the NEPC in areas such as planning, human resource development, and monitoring on \nany projects ongoing in the North East, with a focus on impact monitoring, capacity building, and \nsustainability. The GTZ assistance will be available to the Project as needed on a preferential \nbasis.  \n \n30.  Given the complexity and sensitivity of the Project and the need for close coordination \nwith the actors in the North East\u2014Government, LTTE, external assistance agencies, NGOs, \nand others\u2014the Project will be administered through ADB\u2019s Sri Lanka Resident Mission in \nColombo, as is presently the case for the NECORD and CAARP projects.  \n \n2.  Selection and Approval of Subprojects \n \n31.  Subprojects will be selected to ensure equitable distribution of rehabilitation activities \nacross all the affected districts\u2014taking into account geographic and sector balances along with \n  ", "  11\nthe ethnic composition of the project area\u2014to maximize benefits in the affected areas and, \nequally important, to not contribute to the intercommunal tensions that initially led to the conflict. \nThe subproject selection process will also reflect the need to link assistance to progress in the \npeace process (para. 4). Subprojects will be identified and selected in accordance with sector-\nspecific criteria agreed upon by the Government and ADB, as presented in Appendix 5. In \naddition, regardless of the sector, each subproject proposal will be selected on the basis of the \nfollowing general criteria:  \n \n(i)  The subproject will rehabilitate or reconstruct the conflict-damaged infrastructure, \nand/or directly address the requirements of the conflict-affected people.  \n \n(ii)  The subproject will be identified and prioritized based on the needs assessment \n(footnote  3),  and  will  be  further  selected  and  designed  taking  beneficiary \nconsultations into account.  \n \n(iii)  The subproject reflects the requirement for a reasonable balance of activities \namong communities and districts in the Project area.  \n \n(iv)  The subproject will not be financed by another aid agency, unless the other \nagency and ADB are cofinancing it.  \n \n(v)  The  subproject  must  be  technically  feasible  and  represent  the  least-cost \nalternative, taking into account the need to provide for a reasonable increase in \ndemand in the future.  \n \n(vi)  The equipment, materials, and other resources required can be acquired in, or \ntransported to, the subproject location without unreasonable obstruction or delay.  \n \n(vii)  The subproject can be completed within the Project implementation period.  \n \n(viii)  The  subproject  is  in  compliance  with  the  Government's  environmental \nrequirements  and  ADB's  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines  (2003)  as  well  as  its  Environmental  Guidelines  for \nSelected  Infrastructure  Development  Projects  and  the  agreed  Environmental \nAssessment Framework (Appendix 11). For subprojects that require an initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE), the IEE is included in the subproject proposal, \nand government environmental clearance is obtained prior to the award of the \nsubproject contract.  \n \n(ix)  The subproject will not involve any land acquisition or involuntary resettlement. If \neither  of  these  is,  in  fact,  required,  in  the  course  of  the  Project,  it  will  be \nconducted in accordance with the Government\u2019s applicable laws and regulations, \nthe  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on \nResettlement: A Guide to Good Practice (1998), and the agreed resettlement \nframework (Appendix 8).  \n \n32.  Subproject proposals will be prepared by the IA in formats agreed between the Borrower \nand ADB. The subproject proposals will be reviewed, prioritized, and approved, by PPCC during \nits regular meetings. The PMU will be responsible for establishing the necessary management \ninformation  system  to  track  subprojects  through  their  preparation,  submission,  approval, \nimplementation, and benefit monitoring and evaluation stages. The system also tracks critical ", "12  \nethnic community and regional balances in allocation of subprojects. Details of the subproject \nselection process are provided in Appendix 9.  \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n \n33.  The Project will be implemented over a 2.5-year period, ending concurrently with the \nongoing  NECORD  Project  on  31  December  2006  (Appendix 10).  With  NECORD  project \nadministration  systems  already  well  founded  and  fully  functioning,  minimal  time  will  be \nnecessary  to  commence  implementation  of  the  Project\u2019s  subprojects.  The  capacity  of  the \nvarious implementing departments and the nascent construction industry has begun to evolve\u2014\nin  part  through  the  NECORD  subprojects  already  completed\u2014but  the  need  for  continued \ncapacity building remains. To ensure an on-schedule completion, subprojects will be small \nscale,  although  generally  larger  than  typical  subprojects  already  implemented  through \nNECORD, and will have construction periods of less than 2 years. Contractor capacity has also \nrecently been strengthened through a series of construction and contracting seminars presented \nby GTZ and ADB through NECORD in each of the eight project districts.  \n \n4.  Social and Environmental Measures \n \n34.  As it is for NECORD, the Project will not require land acquisition or resettlement; only \nvacant  state-owned  land  will  be  used  for  project  improvements.  Reconstruction  and \nrehabilitation will generally take place at existing infrastructure locations. The works will be \ndesigned to ensure that improvements will be within existing property boundaries. Cluster-\nhousing units for teachers will be located at or adjacent to existing education facilities, on \ngovernment land. However, to comply with ADB\u2019s safeguard policy requirement for a sector \nloan, a resettlement framework, as presented in Appendix 8, has been agreed upon by the \nGovernment and ADB to address any possible adverse impacts relating to land acquisition or \ninvoluntary resettlement. It is unlikely that indigenous peoples will be affected by the Project. In \nthe event of their involvement in any of the subprojects, all necessary actions required under \nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1999) will be taken.  \n \n35.  The  Project  is  classified  as  a  category  \u201cB\u201d  project,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002). The Project involves small-scale civil and building works at sites \npreviously or currently used for the same or similar purposes and is not likely to generate any \nsignificant environmental impact. All subprojects will be required to complete and satisfy an \nenvironmental checklist during formulation. For subprojects located within areas subject to the \nCoast Conservation Act No. 64 of 1988, the Flora and Fauna Project Ordinance of 1937 and as \namended, and the Forest Ordinance of 1907 and as amended, ADB will require that applicable \nenvironmental clearance be obtained from the environmental concerns associated with the \nrehabilitation  activities.  Recommended  mitigation  measures  will  be  incorporated  into \ncontractors\u2019 work assignments. To ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s environmental policy and with \nthe  Government\u2019s  environmental  requirements,  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedures are provided in Appendix 11 to guide the implementation of the Project.  \n \n5.  Procurement of Civil Works and Equipment \n \n36.  Procurement of goods and services under the Project will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and the Government\u2019s tender procedures acceptable to \nADB. ADB\u2019s procedures for providing rehabilitation assistance after disasters provide for flexible \ninterpretation of these guidelines, so that project activities can start promptly. Local procurement \nwill be the preferred mode for all project activities because of the relatively short implementation \n  ", "  13\nperiod, the small size of contract packages, the wide geographic spread of the project sites, and \nthe need for local awareness of security and other frequently changing matters relevant to \naccessing the project area, in particular where the LTTE controls access. Local procurement will \nbe restricted to private sector companies and joint ventures; state-owned entities will not be \neligible  to  participate  in  the  project,  either  as  sole  contractors,  joint-venture  partners,  or \nsubcontractors.  \n \n37.  It  is  presently  intended  that  none  of  the  Project\u2019s  civil  works  contracts  will  exceed \n$2.5 million in cost. However, if this situation changes, civil works contracts with estimated \nvalues greater than $2.5 million will be procured in accordance with international competitive \nbidding procedures. Contracts with estimated values of $2.5 million and below will be procured \nin accordance with local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to ADB, typically \nthose now used for NECORD. Contracts with estimated values less than $100,000 will be \nprocured under LCB using post-facto approval procedures, also typical for NECORD. LCB civil \nworks procurement will include, where relevant, single-stage, two-envelope procedures, and \nbidding periods of at least 21 days.  \n \n38.  Equipment and materials will be procured under international competitive bidding where \nthe estimated cost is more than $500,000 equivalent, by international shopping where the \nestimated cost is between $300,000 and $500,000 equivalent, and through local procurement \nprocedures acceptable to ADB where the estimated cost is $300,000 equivalent or less. Minor \nitems costing less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured through direct purchase.  \n \n39.  The Government has requested ADB\u2019s approval of advance action for procurement of \ncivil works, including inviting and receiving bids for contracts, for subprojects that might be \napproved for implementation prior to loan effectiveness. The Government has been advised that \nADB\u2019s approval of advance action would not commit ADB to financing the Project.  \n \n6.  Consulting Services \n \n40.  The existing consultants for NECORD, who are providing procurement and contract \nmanagement support, and training of domestic agencies, will extend their services through \ndirect selection to cover the additional requirements of the Project. For new services, primarily \nfor the preparation of master plans and bid documents for larger subprojects, particularly in the \nhealth sector, consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic consultants. Consultants will be provided individually and through firms; quality and \ncost-based selection procedures will be used in the recruitment of consulting firms. Individual \nconsultants  will  also  be  fielded  to  assist  in  the  preparation  of  gender-oriented  economic \nactivities and business cooperatives. The Project will require approximately 350 person-months \nof domestic consulting services. Sample outline terms of reference for potential consultant \nassignments are provided in Appendix 12.  \n \n41.  The Government has requested ADB\u2019s approval of advance action for recruitment of \nconsultants,  including  preparing  and  negotiating  direct  selection  contracts  with  consultants \nalready installed on NECORD. The Government has been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of \nadvance action would not commit ADB to financing the Project.  \n ", "14  \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n42.  Loan disbursements will be made through procedures similar to those used in NECORD \nand in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, as amended from time to time, \nand with detailed arrangements between the Government and ADB. For larger contracts, direct \npayment and commitment letter procedures will be used. For other activities, an imprest account \nwill be established at the Central Bank with MPCLG, which in turn will fund a second-generation \nimprest account (SGIA) at the province level, to be operated by NEPC. The initial amount to be \ndeposited into these imprest accounts will not exceed the equivalent of 6 month\u2019s estimated \nexpenditure, or $800,000, whichever is less. Third-generation imprest accounts (TGIAs) will be \nestablished by the NEPC at the district level at banks to be agreed by the Government and ADB \nfor each district, and operated by the respective DPMUs. The initial amount to be deposited into \neach TGIA will not exceed the equivalent of 6 month\u2019s estimated expenditure, or $100,000, \nwhichever is less. The SGIA and TGIAs are necessary as implementation of the Project will be \nat  the  provincial  and  district  levels.  Through  their  successful  management  of  NECORD\u2019s \nfinances, the agencies at all three levels have the resources and experience to manage Project \nfunding effectively.  \n \n43.  The imprest accounts, SGIA and TGIAs will be established, managed, replenished, and \nliquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements \nagreed to by the Government and ADB. Statement of expenditures (SOE) procedures may be \nused  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances  made  into  the  imprest \naccounts, the SGIA and the TGIAs in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nAny  individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedures will not exceed the equivalent of $50,000.  \n \n44.  The PMU will be responsible for monitoring accounts, including monthly reconciliation of \nthe accounts and preparation of the withdrawal applications for liquidation or replenishment of \nthe imprest account. Financial performance of the PMU for NECORD has been satisfactory, \nhaving processed contracts for nearly 500 separate subprojects to date.  \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n45.  The MPCLG, NEPC, and PMU, as they are doing now for NECORD, will maintain \nseparate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  financing  resources  received  and \nexpenditures made on the Project, including the goods, works, and services financed out of the \nloan proceeds and out of local funds. These project accounts and related financial statements \nwill be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by auditors acceptable to \nADB. The Government will submit annual audited reports and related financial statements to \nADB within 12 months after the end of each fiscal year; compliance of audit submissions for \nNECORD has been satisfactory. The audit of imprest accounts and statements of expenditures \nwill be carried out as part of the annual audit, with the auditor\u2019s opinion of that part separately \nset out in the auditor\u2019s report. Independent audit, if required, is provided for in the project costs.  \n \n46.  The PMU presently prepares brief progress reports for NECORD each month. Project \nactivities will be similarly reported in separate monthly reports. Subproject completion reports, \nwhich identify project impact, will be prepared for each subproject. Within 3 months of the \nphysical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  Government  will  furnish  to  ADB  an  overall  project \ncompletion report providing a detailed evaluation of the project design, costs, contractor and \nconsultant performance, social and economic impact, and other details as may be requested by \nADB.  \n  ", "  15\n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n47.  The  management  information  system  developed  for  NECORD\u2014in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Project  Performance  Management  System  Handbook\u2014will  be  used  to  monitor \nsubproject benefits and impacts. Baseline indicators and targets for each subproject will be \ndeveloped prior to implementation for monitoring purposes as well as for checking against \nselection criteria. The outputs of the system will provide major inputs to the Project\u2019s monthly \nprogress reporting.  \n \n10.  Project Review \n \n48.  The  Project  will  have  regular  reviews  by  the  staff  of  Sri  Lanka  Resident  Mission, \nincluding  attendance  at  PPCC  meetings  to  consider  and  approve  subprojects  for \nimplementation.  However,  as  the  Project  was  formulated  during  the  midterm  review  of \nNECORD\u2014which reviewed all requirements and safeguard policies at that time\u2014and given the \nrelatively short implementation period, no midterm review will be conducted, unless deemed \nnecessary by ADB and the EA. In that event, the Government will submit to ADB a detailed \nprogress report on the implementation and achievement of the Project.  \n \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n \n49.  A high incidence of poverty is evident in the conflict-affected north and east, with poverty \nlevels much higher than in the rest of the country, ranging from 60% to as high as 90%. Basic \nfacilities have to be restored if the affected communities are to recover from the effects of the \nconflict and begin the long climb toward development that has been available to the rest of the \ncountry during the past two decades. Rehabilitation that has taken place to date remains \ninadequate in the face of the immense destruction caused. A summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is provided as Appendix 13.  \n \n50.  The Project will address the urgent needs of a population of approximately 2 million, \nconsisting in large part of the physically disabled, female-headed households, and children. \nThese  people  are  now  beginning  to  rebuild  their  lives  in  areas  that  have  seen  serious \ndestruction and lengthy neglect. Through the restoration of sectors that form the backbone of \nthe economy of the North East, the Project serves as a channel that brings about normalcy to \nthe lives of the affected communities and assists in stabilizing the economic basis of those \naffected by the conflict, reducing their dependency on government support and securing a \nsustainable livelihood. The Project makes significant interventions in the health sector through \naddressing immediate and long-term needs of the communities that have been, and are still, \ndenied basic health needs. School buildings alone will not suffice in areas that are isolated and \nlack facilities. Given that education is of paramount importance for restoring normalcy and \nsecurity, particularly to children, specific subproject interventions that encourage teachers to \nreside in the locality of the school will make schooling a continual experience for students and \nenable students to make up for previous education opportunities lost.  \n \n51.  The  Project  focuses  on  restoring  preexisting  facilities  with  appropriate  provision  for \ntechnical improvement and future demand, based on a least-cost approach. After years of \nneglect and damage to administrative capacities, with 32% of administrative posts currently ", "16  \nvacant and 60% of buildings belonging to administration and local authorities either destroyed or \ndamaged,  project  interventions  focus  not  only  on  the  physical  rehabilitation  of  damaged \ninfrastructure  but  also  on  the  restoration  of  uninterrupted  high-quality  administrative  and \ntechnical services in the area.  \n \n52.  There is an important need to create an environment conducive for vulnerable groups of \nwomen in the conflict areas so they may become economically independent. Despite significant \nfunding channeled toward microenterprise development for women in the conflict zone, to date \nthere are no visible cohesive mechanisms that work toward uplifting the status of women as \nindependent contributors to the economy; their situation remains vulnerable and insecure, and \nthe Project is sensitive to this need. In addition, in a climate of competition and resentment \nwhen  whole  communities  are  beginning  to  rebuild  their  lives,  a  mechanism  is  needed  to \nencourage a more harmonious social climate and reduce communal tensions, suspicion, and \nhostility. Recognizing this, the Project will promote opportunities to foster peace among the \nthree different ethnic communities.  \n \nB.  Peace and Conflict Risks \n \n53.  The peace and conflict impact assessment is provided in Appendix 14. Reflecting the \nlinkage between aid agency assistance and progress in the peace process (para. 4), there is a \nrisk that, should the peace process falter, the Project\u2019s scope and schedule may require review. \nHowever, given the recently restated commitment of the Government and the LTTE to resume \npeace talks, and the robustness of the peace process itself\u2014despite recent political and other \nuncertainties, it remains intact and the cease-fire agreed to in 2002 continues to be observed\u2014\nthis  risk  is  assessed  to  be  small.  On  condition  that  the  beneficial  outcomes  are  shared \nsufficiently equitably among the major ethnic groups and across the target area, the Project is \nnot expected to contribute to an intensification of social tensions. The relatively small scale and \nlocal nature of activities appears to make them unlikely to be captured by elite or sectarian \ninterests. Beyond just \u201cdoing no harm,\u201d the Project can potentially make a positive contribution \nto the rebuilding of key infrastructure and help to make existing infrastructure\u2014schools, for \nexample\u2014more  effective  in  strengthening  the  socioeconomic  fabric  of  the  conflict-affected \nareas. The challenge will be in implementing these activities in a conflict-sensitive manner, \nensuring that:  \n \n(i)  subprojects are selected to ensure an ethnic balance that reasonably reflects the \ngeneral ethnic composition of the area;  \n \n(ii)  all major stakeholders, including the LTTE, are consulted regarding the final \nchoice of subprojects;  \n \n(iii)  rigorous measures are applied to limit the possibility of corruption in construction \nwork diverting resources to local, subnational, or national elites; and \n \n(iv)  all activities are characterized by transparency, so that the relevant stakeholders \nunderstand the project criteria and how the Project is progressing.  \n \n \n  ", "  17\nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n54.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances, which have been incorporated into the legal documents.  \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that project staff, materials, vehicles, equipment and \nall  other  items  required  for  the  implementation  of  the  Project  will  be  given \nreasonable access to the project area.  \n \n(ii)  The Government will continue its program of filling teacher vacancies, particularly \nin the Tamil language, and will ensure that teachers are available when required \nto staff the schools that are rehabilitated or improved with project assistance.  \n \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that, for training, extension, and similar facilities \nwhere construction or rehabilitation of buildings is required, (i) staffing is available \nand requires only the completion of the facility for training to commence, and \n(ii) staff so trained will not be reassigned out of the project area.  \n \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that adequate counterpart funds are made available \nto the Project when and in the amount required to enable the project agencies to \ndischarge their responsibilities under the Project.  \n \n(v)  The Government will ensure that the facilities provided under the Project are \noperated and maintained appropriately, and that adequate budgetary and other \nresources will be provided for this purpose. The Government will also ensure that \ncommunity-based organizations charged with operating and maintaining facilities \nprovided under the Project are provided with the support and training required to \nundertake these activities.  \n \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that all project interventions contribute to peace \nbuilding and community reconciliation. In the event that any intervention is having \nor is thought to have a negative impact on peace-building and reconciliation \nefforts, the Government agrees that ADB will have the discretion to determine \nwhether  the  intervention  should  be  continued,  redesigned,  suspended,  or \ncanceled.  \n \n(vii)  The  project  management  arrangements  reflect  the  present  government \nadministration  structure  in  the  North  East  that  may  change  during \nimplementation. The Government will immediately notify ADB of any proposed \nchange in the administrative structure in the project areas, and take all steps \nnecessary to ensure that the project management arrangements are revised in \nconsultation with ADB to reflect the new administrative structure and protect the \nviability of the Project. The Government will take all steps necessary and within \nits power to ensure than any successor project management entities enter into \nsuch project or other agreements with ADB as ADB may request.  \n \n(viii)  The Government will ensure that adequate environmental mitigation measures, \nin  accordance  with  (a) the  Government\u2019s  environmental  regulations  and \n(b) ADB's  Environment  Policy  (2002),  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected ", "18  \nInfrastructure  Development  Projects  and  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines  (2003),  are  incorporated  into  all  subproject  designs  and \nimplementation.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  agreed  environmental \nassessment framework (Appendix 11) is implemented; that all subprojects for \nwhich an IEE is required include such an IEE in the subproject proposal; and that \nall subprojects for which government environmental clearance is required obtain \nsuch clearance prior to the award of any contracts for that subproject. \n \n(ix)  The Government will ensure that, to the extent possible, subprojects will not \nrequire  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement.  In  the  event  that  land \nacquisition or involuntary resettlement is required for any subproject, then the \nGovernment  will  prepare  a  resettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement  (1995),  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Resettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good \nPractice (1998), the resettlement framework (Appendix 8), and submitted to ADB \nfor review and approval before any land acquisition is initiated.  \n \n(x)  The Government will ensure that, in accordance with ADB's Policy on Gender \nand Development (1998), (a) project interventions take into account the different \nimpacts  and  needs  of  women  and  men;  (b) special  features  are  built  into \nsubprojects  to  facilitate  and  encourage  women\u2019s  involvement  and  to  ensure \ntangible  benefits  to  women;  (c) specific  women-related  interventions  include \nactivities that uplift women from situations of vulnerability to positions of stability; \nand (d) project reporting reflects how gender-related needs are being addressed \nby the Project, and details the successes encountered, constraints met, and \nmeasures adopted to overcome them.  \n \n(xi)  The Government will ensure that all ADB-financed contracts under the Project \ninclude  contractual  clauses  during  design  and  construction  requiring  that  all \nnecessary  steps  be  taken  to  avoid  adverse  consequences  to  the  natural \nenvironment,  prevent  noise  pollution,  environmental  hygiene  related  issues, \nselection of sites for the extraction of construction materials, and selection of \nroads for transport of such construction materials. \n \n(xii)  The Government will ensure that subprojects will not affect vulnerable population \ngroups, such as indigenous peoples. In the event of their involvement in any of \nthe subprojects, the Government will take all necessary actions required under \nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).  \n \n(xiii)  The Government and the NEPC will ensure that all subprojects meet, to the \nsatisfaction  of  ADB,  the  agreed  selection  criteria  and  implementation \narrangements and that all subprojects are, to the satisfaction of ADB, properly \ncontrolled and monitored.  \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n \n55.  Based  on  consultation  with  the  Government,  development  partners,  and  other \nstakeholders, ADB shall have determined that the peace process is proceeding in a manner \nlikely to maintain the ongoing cease-fire and, over time, to lead to an end to the conflict.  \n \n \n  ", "  19\nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n56.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the supplementary loan in various currencies \nequivalent to Special Drawing Rights 6,864,000.00 to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri \nLanka for the North East Community Restoration and Development - Extension Project from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years, \nwith repayment of principal at 2% per year for the first 10 years after the grace period and 4% a \nyear thereafter, with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project \nAgreements presented to the Board.  \n \n \n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n24 May 2004 \n \n ", "20 Appendix 1 \nNECORD SUBPROJECT SUMMARY \n \n \n1.

Introduction \n \n1.  Detailed sector criteria were established for subprojects developed for the North East \nCommunity Restoration and Development (NECORD) Project to be used during the process of \nselecting and approving subprojects for implementation. These criteria will be applied to all \nsubprojects presented and considered for approval under the Project.  \n \nB.  Health \n \n2.  As the immediate need for improved medical and health services remains of foremost \nimportance,  additional  assistance  to  the  health  sector  is  critical  in  the  overall  assistance \nprogram  in  the  north  and  east.  To  help  improve  the  level  of  medical  services  available, \nsubproject components will include the restoration of larger medical facilities through hospital \nreconstruction and refurbishment, replacement of medical equipment and furniture, construction \nof doctors\u2019 quarters at hospital compounds, and minor improvements at village health clinics.  \n \n1.  Sector Criteria \n \n3.  The  health  component  under  the  Project  includes  rehabilitation  of  hospitals  and \nprovision of equipment, to provide better access to basic health facilities. In addition to the \ngeneral criteria requirements for considering subprojects in the health sector, the following \ncriteria will be applied:  \n \n(i)  Preference will be given to hospitals serving the largest patient population or the \nwidest outreach. \n \n(ii)  Capacity will be increased for hospitals where present capacity to meet basic \nhealth needs is inadequate and when there is confirmation that adequate budget \nis available for the additional staff necessary to operate the expanded facility.  \n \n(iii)  Improvements  for  larger  medical  facilities  will  follow  phased  construction \naccording to master plans and detailed designs that follow contemporary design \ntrends. \n \n(iv)  All new equipment will be compatible with existing equipment, use appropriate \ntechnology, and be accommodated under the maintenance resources available \nin the area. \n \n2.  Representative Subprojects \n \n4.  Representative health sector subprojects include the following:  \n \n(i)  Chavakacheri Hospital, Jaffna district\u2014reconstruction of facilities, which were \ncompletely destroyed in the conflict; makeshift medical facilities are currently \noperating in the former Ministry of Health administration building adjacent to the \nhospital compound; \n \n ", "Appendix 5    29\n(ii)  Vavuniya  General  Hospital\u2014rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  facilities,  which \nserve 600,000 people in the four-district area, through upgrade of construction of \nbuildings and provision of equipment; \n \n(iii)  Mannar  Base  Hospital\u2014rehabilitation  and  expansion,  through  construction  of \nbuildings and provision of equipment; \n \n(iv)  Batticaloa outpatient development (OPD) ward; \n \n(v)  Maha-oya Base Hospital, Ampara district\u2014construction of building for OPD and \nother specialist wards. \n \n(vi)  Pottuvil Hospital, Ampara district\u2014rehabilitation and reconstruction of facilities \n \nC.  Education \n \n5.  The immediate need for schools and improved educational facilities remains high in the \nconflict-affected areas. However, with the lack of adequate housing available for teachers, some \nof the schools constructed in more remote district areas have experienced difficulties in locating \nor retaining the necessary teaching staff. To realize the full potential from these reconstructed \nschools, accommodations must also be provided for teachers.  \n \n6.  The scope of this component therefore is the rehabilitation of schools and the provision \nof facilities that will make schooling an uninterrupted experience for conflict-affected children. \nSubprojects  in  the  education  sector  will  primarily  address  the  immediate  need  to  restore \neducation services and facilities through (i) the reconstruction and rehabilitation of teaching \nfacilities and school buildings serving a large population area, (ii) construction of cluster housing \nunits for teachers in areas where existing housing is limited or unavailable, and (iii) provision of \nEnglish-language training to existing teachers.  \n \n1.  Sector Criteria \n \n7.  In  addition  to  the  general  criteria  requirements  for  considering  subprojects  in  the \neducation sector, the following criteria will be applied: \n \n(i)  Cluster housing units will be provided for schools in areas with little available \naccommodation and high teacher vacancies.  \n \n(ii)  Cluster housing units will be centrally located to provide access to the greatest \nnumber of schools in the area.  \n \n(iii)  Preference  to  be  given  for  rural  schools  and  urban  schools  damaged  or \ndestroyed due to the conflict.  \n \n(iv)  Education sector improvements should not be included in any other ongoing \nfunded project.  \n \n2.  Representative Subprojects \n \n8.  Representative education sector subprojects include the following: \n \n ", "30 Appendix 5    \n(i)  Kilinochchi  Central  College\u2014reconstruct  all  classroom  buildings,  science \nlaboratory, activity rooms at the 1,200-student facility destroyed in the conflict; \n \n(ii)  Cluster housing units\u2014provide housing compounds for teachers in remote areas, \ncentrally located to cater to four to six schools in the area; \n \n(iii)  English  training  program\u2014assist  in  providing  specialist  training  to  existing \nteachers in using the English language as a teaching medium. \n \nD.  Income Generation, Capacity Building, and Social Cohesion \n \n9.  Subprojects  in  these  sectors  will  be  developed  to  restore  livelihoods,  provide \nopportunities  for  income  generation,  and  support  reconciliation  and  social  cohesion.  This \ncomponent of the Project will also focus on subprojects that take into consideration the different \nneeds of women and men in the communities. Restoring the Agriculture Faculty University \nFacility in Kilinochchi, subject to further detailed discussion with the Government about the \nsustainability and efficiency of reestablishing a single-purpose faculty of the Jaffna University at \nKilinochchi, will promote education and training in the agriculture sector. Livelihood opportunities \nwill  be  provided  in  the  agricultural  and  fisheries  sectors  through  subprojects  that  promote \nlivestock  development  and  market  gardening,  provide  facilities  for  seed  production,  and \nestablish inland aquaculture and fish-breeding programs. Replacement of district agriculture \ncenters will help assist female and male farmers in rural areas. Skills development and service \ntraining will also be provided without gender bias for microenterprise development in areas such \nas horticulture, postharvest food processing, and the tourist and hotel industry. A cultural hall in \nVavuniya will help with the reintegration of the three ethnic communities. Capacity building in \nthe conflict-affected areas will be improved through subprojects that provide staff quarters for \ngovernment employees in areas where accommodations are difficult to find or unavailable.  \n \n10.  Given the wide range of potential subprojects, and considering a sector implementation \napproach, broad criteria are presented. With the limited amount of financing available\u2014and the \nneeds far outweigh the funding available\u2014not all subprojects can be implemented under the \nProject.  \n \n1.  Sector Criteria \n \n11.  This  component  of  the  Project  provides  for  rehabilitation  of  agriculture  extension \nservices, rehabilitation of infrastructure, and development of inland fisheries.

Context \n \n1.  Two decades of conflict in the North East and the resultant increase of violent incidences \nagainst  women  in  the  area  have  instilled  fear  and  inhibition  in  the  minds  of  the  people. \nDiscussions with nongovernment organizations (NGOs) in the North East reveal that violence \nagainst women is an issue that is on the increase. In a context where women generally play a \nsubordinate role in society, this has served to further push women into insecure positions.  \n \n2.  Poverty levels in the North East are high, as high as 90% in certain areas. Of this \npopulation,  women  are  a  majority,  with  an  inordinately  large  number  of  female-headed \nhouseholds. Women, who have followed traditional patterns of work with the sole burden of \nhousehold care undertaken by them, are conditioned into thinking that they are incapable and \nunsuitable for the role of the head of household. The conflict has forced women to assume the \nrole of head of household, albeit devoid of the confidence, income generation skills, and the \nsocietal support and cooperation that must accompany this shift in roles.  \n \n3.  Daily wage labor rates for women in the North East, except in a few areas and specific \nsectors,  are  lower  than  those  for  men.  Many  women  undertake  traditional  home-based \neconomic activities in order to carry out dual roles of caring for the household as well as earning \nan income. In this work pattern, women do not enjoy the maximum benefits of their efforts, as \nthey often lack the confidence and experience in marketing and selling at higher levels. Cultural \nconditioning and lack of personal security are added factors that limit women, resulting in their \nbeing exploited.  \n \nB.  Analysis \n \n4.  Overall, 88% of the population in the North East is rural. Therefore, at least initially, \nemployment  generation  has  to  come  mainly  from  reviving  and  expanding  rural  economic \nactivities. Considering the fact that women constitute more than half of the population in these \nareas, as in the rest of the country, their capacities have to be built if they were contribute to the \ndevelopment and economy of their communities. Work patterns, attitudes, lack of skills, and lack \nof security have to be dealt with if women are to successfully involve themselves in economic \nactivities, with the ability to access and control their resources and to gain the full profit of their \nendeavor.  \n \n5.  Human  security  gains  primacy  in  a  situation  of  conflict,  particularly  for  women.  If \npersonal security is threatened, economic activity cannot be undertaken. For women to be \ninvolved in economically productive activities, they have to first be provided with a secure \nenvironment in which to work. Further, they need to be trained in specific skills such as trade-\nbased  skills,  management,  investment,  profit-making,  marketing,  leadership  skills,  and \nawareness on gender issues. Considering the social backdrop that they are placed in, attitudinal \nchanges are needed.  \n \n6.  In the 20 years of war, women have been perceived as victims, in vulnerable positions \nsuch as \u201cwar widows.\u201d In a context of overall development, it is time that society and women \ndefine a more active role for themselves other than positions of vulnerability. They need to be \nactive in decision-making bodies; they need to be seen as visible actors in the peace process. \nGiving them strength in economic activities helps uplift them to positions of economic stability \nand bargaining power.  ", "34 Appendix 6 \nC.  Solution \n \n7.  Experience shows that if equitable outcomes are to be achieved, gender dimensions of \nissues have to be addressed adequately. This initiative focuses its intervention among the \nwomen of fishing communities in the North East that have a high number of female-headed \nhouseholds,  women  who  have  been  traumatized  by  the  disappearance  or  death  of  male \nmembers  of  their  families.  The  initiative  is  formulated  to  provide  the  secure  environment, \ntraining, confidence, and marketing facilities needed to allow them to become active participants \nand contributors to the economy.  \n \nD.  Methodology \n \n8.  The initial phase of this women\u2019s enterprise initiative will be to undertake a case study of \na few areas severely affected by the conflict with an aim of establishing a replicable model of \nwomen\u2019s business centers in two districts. Special attention will be paid to the institutional and \nbusiness/marketing  aspects  of  the  area.  Two  individual  consultants  will  conduct  the  case \nstudies in the districts of Jaffna and Mullaittivu in the North. Additional guidance and assistance \nwill also be available from the German Government\u2019s Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische \nZusammenarbeit (GTZ) that has provided a team of international and domestic specialists to \nassist in NECORD and in the development and administration of other projects implemented in \nthe  North  East.  These  two  women\u2019s  business  centers  will  be  established  as  a  prototype \nprogram; lessons learned from this program will be applied in the wider-scale development of \nwomen\u2019s business centers in follow-on projects in the North East. A key focus of these case \nstudies  will  be  to  identify  tools  and  strategies  that  will  help  ensure  sustainability  of  such \ninitiatives beyond the life of the Project.  \n \n9.  In the case study, the consultant will conduct a participatory needs assessment in these \ncommunities. Direct consultation will be made with the women themselves, especially those in \nfemale-headed households among the fisherfolk, to understand their skills base, constraints in \naccess to resources, and their  interests and  management capacity  in collective enterprise \ndevelopment activities. The study will also focus on market outlets for possible products.  \n \n10.  Based on community needs identified in the case study, industries will be proposed and \nestablished within easy access of the women in the area. To assist women in gaining more \ncontrol of businesses, skills development and training on different aspects of management, \ntechnical know-how, marketing and profit-making, leadership, and gender-equity awareness, will \nbe provided under the Project. The Project will build on existing networks, such as the women's \nrural development societies (WRDS) in each district, and elicit cooperation of identified women\u2019s \nNGOs. Initially, a staff of volunteers selected from the WRDS will coordinate activities related to \nthe business center, with assistance and direction given by the government agents of the two \ndistricts. Initial operational costs will be provided by the Project along with contributions from \neach WRDS. Profits earned will be ploughed back into the centers. All workers of the center will \nbe  partners  in  this  business-collective  and  will  have  ownership  and  control  over  the \nmanagement of these businesses.  \n \n11.  The center will provide buildings to house the different industries  identified and an \nadministrative section. There will also be a community center to hold training courses and \nmeetings.  For  such  an  activity,  the  Project  also  provides  a  secure  setting,  an  enabling \nenvironment that brings out the best in women\u2019s entrepreneurship. The Project will in some \nmeasure be instrumental in uplifting the status of women in the conflict zones from positions of \nvulnerability to that of economic independence and stability.

Project Background \n \n1.  The Project consists mainly of community development, restoration, and infrastructure, \nincluding the reconstruction of school buildings and health facilities.  \n \n2.  All proposed subprojects under the Project fall either under Category B1 (insignificant \nimpacts) or C (no impacts). No indigenous peoples will be affected, as the Project is designed to \nensure that all communities, on an equitable basis, will benefit from the Project. The Project will \naddress the special needs of minority communities in the context of their social and cultural \nsystems. As part of the selection criteria, subprojects that may entail significant impacts will not \nbe included. The Project will be implemented under a sector approach, therefore, the following \nresettlement  framework  was  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB  to  guide  the \nGovernment  in  preparing  a  resettlement  plan  (RP),  if  this  becomes  necessary  during \nimplementation.  \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Entitlements \n \n3.  The resettlement framework aims to ensure that screening, planning, and management \nprocedures for involuntary resettlement on all subprojects will be in compliance with the Policy \non Involuntary Resettlement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other ADB social \nsafeguard policies.  \n \n4.  This policy framework has been built upon the existing Laws of the Land, Electricity Act \nNo. 17 1969 and amendment, National Involuntary Resettlement Policy (2001),2 and ADB\u2019s \nresettlement policy. The policy principles adopted are:  \n(i)  Avoid, minimize and mitigate negative land acquisition and resettlement impacts \nby reviewing alternatives to the project;  \n \n(ii)  If  involuntary  resettlement  is  unavoidable,  the  displaced  persons  should  be \nassisted to reestablish themselves and improve their quality of life;  \n \n(iii)  Gender quality and equity should be ensured and adhered to throughout the \npolicy;  \n \n(iv)  Affected persons (APs) should be fully involved in the selection of relocation \nsites,  livelihood  compensation,  and  development  options  at  the  earliest \nopportunity; cash compensation will be used since the Project will only require a \nsmall amount of land;  \n \n(v)  Compensation for loss of land, structures, and assets should be based on full \nreplacement cost3 (including transaction costs) and should be paid promptly;  \n                                                 \n1  Insignificant impacts\u2014fewer than 200 people are displaced from housing, fewer than 200 people will lose less than \n10% of their productive assets, or 200 people or more experience minor impacts. A short resettlement plan will be \nrequired for each Category B subproject.  \n2  To assist the relevant agencies in planning, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating all involuntary resettlement \nimpacts,  the  following  guidelines  are  provided:  (i) General  Guidelines  on  Planning  and  Implementation  of \nInvoluntary Resettlement, (ii) Guidelines for the Preparation of a Resettlement Action Plan, (iii) Process Manual for \nthe Implementation of the NIRP\u2014Ministry of Land, and (iv) Guidelines for a Participatory Resettlement Process. \n \n ", "Appendix 8   37\n \n(vi)  Resettlement should be planned and implemented with full participation of the \nprovincial and local authorities;  \n \n(vii)  Assist those affected to be economically and socially integrated into the host \ncommunities, participatory measures should be designed and implemented;  \n \n(viii)  Common  property  resources  and  community  and  public  services  should  be \nprovided; \n \n(ix)  Resettlement should be planned as a development activity; \n \n(x)  APs  who do not have documented title to  land should receive fair  and just \ntreatment;  \n \n(xi)  Vulnerable  groups  should  be  identified  and  given  appropriate  assistance  to \nsubstantially improve their living standards; and  \n \n(xii)  The Government should bear full costs of compensation and resettlement. \n \n5.

Procedures  \n \n6.  For the Category B subprojects, the following checklist needs to be answered and \nattached to subprojects proposals:  \n \n(i)  Will the subproject require land? What is the quantity of land required? \n \n(ii)  Will the impact be permanent or temporary (during construction)? \n \n(iii)  Who owns the land? How is land currently used? \n \n(iv)  If private land, how many landowners/tenants/sharecroppers will be affected? \n \n(v)  If state land, is it subject to customary claim? \n \n(vi)  If state land, are there any squatters or encroachers? \n \n(vii)  Are there any houses, structures, trees, and crops that will be affected? \n \n(viii)  How many households will be physically displaced? Can they move back to the \nresidual land? \n \n(ix)  Are there any public or community infrastructures? \n \n(x)  Will indigenous peoples be adversely affected? \n \n7.  In preparing the RP, the following procedures must be followed: \n \n(i)  Carry out consultations with various stakeholders to obtain inputs in avoiding or \nminimizing impacts, in RP planning, and in identifying needs and preferences of \nAPs.  \n \n(ii)  Undertake census (100% coverage) as well as asset inventory and detailed \nmeasurement surveys. A socioeconomic survey of sample population will also be \nundertaken.  \n \n(iii)  Analyze data to identify different categories of APs based on the degree and \nscale of impacts of the subproject.  \n ", "Appendix 8   39\n \n(iv)  Formulate  a  time-bound  schedule  for  RP  implementation;  procedures  for \ngrievance redress, monitoring and evaluation procedures; and the budget. \n \n(v)  Prepare a draft RP following the entitlement matrix (Table A8). If there are new \ncategories of APs and types of losses are identified, the entitlements will be \nincluded in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement. \n \n(vi)  Translate  into  local  languages  and  present  the  draft  subproject  RP  during \nconsultation and public meetings for comments. The final RP will incorporate the \ncomments and suggestions of the affected communities. \n \n(vii)  Submit the RP to ADB for review and concurrence. The approved subproject RP \nwill be implemented before the award of construction contracts.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements, Consultation, and Grievance Mechanisms \n \n8.  The  implementing  agency  (IA)  will  be  the  North  East  Provincial  Council  (NEPC). \nScreening of subprojects, preparation, implementation, and monitoring of subproject RPs will be \nthe responsibility of the concerned IA through its project management unit (PMU).  \n \n9.  The  subproject  RPs,  if  required,  will  be  based  on  consultation  with  APs  and  local \ngovernment representatives, an appropriate census, and an inventory of losses. Grievances will \nbe handled by the divisional secretary with the assistance of the grama niladhari and PMUs. \nRPs will be disclosed through the PMU field offices and local grama niladhari offices. The IA will \ncarry out its own internal monitoring activities and will submit quarterly reports to the PCC and to \nADB; these will include progress on planning and implementation of RPs.  \n \nE.  Cost Estimates and Financing \n \n10.  The associated costs of land acquisition and resettlement, if any, will be included in the \noverall project costs. The estimate will include measures for (i) planning and budgeting for land \nacquisition and resettlement costs, annual budget, and sources of funding; (ii) arrangements for \napproval of RP cost estimates; and (iii) the flow of funds to reach the people affected.  \n ", "40 Appendix 9  \nSUBPROJECT SELECTION PROCESS \n \n1.  The North East Community Restoration and Development (NECORD) Extension Project \nwill use the same process approach now used on NECORD to develop and approve specific \nsubprojects. Given the fluid situation of the project area, this approach\u2014highly successful under \nNECORD\u2014will be used to prepare subprojects for implementation under the Project.  \n \n2.  Larger-scale subprojects will be developed primarily at the district level by government \ndepartments,  beneficiaries,  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  These  subproject \nproposals will be then submitted to the divisional rehabilitation committee (DRC) and the district \nrehabilitation coordinating committee (DRCC) present in each of the eight project districts. The \nDRCC reviews and evaluates each proposal against the district development plans and also \nagainst  previously  established  subproject  criteria;  all  subprojects  must  also  satisfy  general \ncriteria for all subprojects. The district project management unit (DPMU) assists with these \nagencies in preparation of the subproject proposals in the standard formats used for the Project.  \n \n3.  After approval by the DRCC, DPMU through the government agent or district secretary \npresent the subproject to the project management unit (PMU) located in Trincomalee. The PMU \nmakes a detailed review of each subproject, considering if the subproject (i) fits the overall \nscope of NECORD, (ii) satisfies the general and component-related criteria, (iii) creates any \nproblems in the area, (iv) has been sufficiently justified, and (v) will attain the desired outputs \nand benefits. The PMU also (i) performs a detailed review of the subproject cost estimate and \nimplementation schedule, (ii) verifies beneficiary contribution, (iii) assesses if contractors are \navailable  and  capable  of  performing  the  work,  (iv)  confirms  that  land  will  be  available  as \nnecessary, and (v) investigates of any gender, social, or environmental concerns.  \n \n4.  If the PMU finds that the subproject satisfies all the evaluation criteria, the proposal will \nbe then forwarded to the provincial project coordinating committee (PPCC) and, 15 days prior to \na PPCC meeting, circulated to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the relevant secretaries, \nministries,  provincial  and  district  heads  of  departments,  government  agents,  government \nsecurity coordinators (police, army), NGOs, and bilateral and multilateral agencies implementing \nprojects in the area for review.  \n \n5.  The PPCC, chaired by the Chief Secretary of the North East Provincial Council, meets, \ntypically at 3-month intervals, to present each subproject for conditional approval. Attendees at \nthe PPCC include ADB, relevant PMU staff, government agents, district deputy project directors, \nand representatives from concerned national ministries. Subprojects not approved by PPCC will \nbe returned to the PMU/DPMU for further clarification or justification. If approved by the PPCC, \nthe PMU informs the proponent to further develop the subproject to include the designs, bill of \nquantities, specifications, and the bid documents. The final proposal will then be forwarded to \nADB for approval. Subprojects not approved by ADB will be returned to the PMU for further \nclarification or modifications to better comply with project criteria or ADB guidelines.  \n \n6.

Introduction \n \n1.   The Project is classified as a category \u201cB\u201d project, in accordance with the Environment \nPolicy (2002) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The envisaged subprojects will mainly \ninvolve activities to rehabilitate and develop the basic social infrastructure that existed prior to \nthe conflict. The sectors included in the Project will be rehabilitation of school and university \nbuildings, health facilities (less than 150 beds), buildings for improvement of capacity building \nand social cohesion, and small demonstration farms.  \n \n2.  The Project will use the same environmental evaluation procedures currently being used \non  Loan  1846-SRI(SF):  North  East  Community  Restoration  and  Development  Project \n(NECORD).  To  ensure  compliance  with  both  the  government  guidelines  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003), environmental checklists, detailed below, will be \nused. The checklists will be completed when the proponents develop the subproject proposals. \nIn the event that any subproject falls within any of the prescribed areas, or falls within the \nGovernment\u2019s and ADB\u2019s prescribed list, subprojects will be subject to an initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) or an environmental impact assessment (EIA) as appropriate prior to the \nimplementation  of  the  subproject.  The  responsibility  for  ensuring  compliance  with  the \nenvironmental  guidelines  will  be  with  the  project  management  unit  (PMU).  Any  mitigating \nmeasures suggested for those subprojects that fall within the list will be included as part of the \ncontract documents for implementation. The responsibilities of the Implementing Agency (IA) \nand ADB are explained in the following sections.  \n \nB.  Responsibilities of Implementing Agency and Asian Development Bank  \n \n3.  The following review procedure will be adopted to facilitate identification and mitigation \nof potential environmental problems or risks related to each subproject:  \n \n(i)  IA responsibilities:  \n(a)  Complete the checklist showed below as part of the subproject proposal. \n(b)  Prepare  the  simplified  IEE  report\u2014currently  being  used  under \nNECORD\u2014for  any  subproject  that  could  fall  within  the  checklist  as \nrequired and submit to ADB as part of the subproject proposal.  \n(c)  Obtain  environmental  clearance  from  the  relevant  project  approving \nagency (PAA) and ADB for environmental compliance before awarding \nany civil works contracts for that subproject.  \n(d)  Ensure  the  implementation  of  environmental  mitigation  measures  as \ndescribed in the IEE report and the PAA clearance (if required).  \n \n(ii)  ADB responsibilities: \n(a)  Review IEE reports and approve qualifying subprojects.  \n(b)  Disclose IEEs and Summary Initial Environmental Examinations of the \nsubprojects as ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) requires.  \n ", "44 Appendix 11 \n(e) Monitor the implementation of mitigation measures through project review \nmissions,  and  conduct  environmental  performance  monitoring  as \nnecessary.  \n  \nC.  Environmental Monitoring and Public Disclosure \n \n4.  The  IA  must  ensure  that  ADB  is  given  access  to  all  subprojects  to  undertake \nenvironmental  monitoring.    However,  the  IA  has  the  full  responsibility  for  monitoring  and \nreporting to ADB on the implementation of environmental mitigation measures for all subprojects \ndescribed in the IEE report and PAA clearance (if required). The environmental monitoring \nreport must be documented by the IA as part of the subproject specific record. Monitoring \nshould also include (i) accumulative environmental impacts by small-scale subprojects for which \nindividual environmental assessments are not carried out; and (ii) effectiveness of mitigation \nmeasures during implementation should be measured\u2014if significant environmental impacts are \nidentified, additional mitigation measures should be considered.  \n \n5.  The  IA  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  environmental  assessment  documents, \nincluding the environmental monitoring reports, are properly and systematically kept as part of \nthe subproject specific record.  \n \n6.  In  addition  to  public  consultations  required  by  national  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002),  all  environmental  documents  are  subject  to  public  disclosure; \ntherefore, these documents should be made available to the public, if requested.  \n \nD.  Environmental Checklists \n \n7.  The following section will be included in the main text of the subproject proposal. If the \nsubproject falls within any category listed in row one, the proponent should fill in the annex listed \nin para 8.  \n \nTable A9.1: Impact of the Subproject on Environment:  \nPlease Check if Appropriate to the Subproject \n \nDoes the subproject fall under the  Yes  No   \nfollowing categories: \n(1) New construction of housing areas \n(more than 100) \n(2) Hospital (more than 150 beds)   If your subproject is here, \n(3) Water supply and sanitation facilities       kindly fill in Annex II (Table \n(more than 500 population)  A9.2) \n(4) Irrigation systems (major/medium) \n(5) Fishing facilities (anchorage/processing) \nOr does the proposed subproject fall under \nthese categories: \n(1) Forestry research and extension,  \n(2) Rural health services     No need to fill in Annex II \n  \n(3) Marine services education   (Table A9.2) \n(4) Geological or mineral surveys  \n(5) Education  \n(6) Family planning, etc. \n ", "Appendix 11  45\n \n8.

Women\u2019s Enterprise Initiative \n \n5.  With a view to assisting women of the conflict-affected areas to uplift themselves from \npositions of vulnerability to economic strength, the Project proposes to establish a sustainable \nwomen-oriented business center in the conflict-affected areas. An individual consultant will be \nengaged to conduct case studies in specified districts in the conflict-affected areas and assist in \nestablishing the prototype center. The main objective of the case study therefore will be to find a \nviable mechanism through which to attain sustainable impact on the livelihoods of women \naffected by the conflict.

Physical injury, the pain of loss, repeated displacement, psychological stress, and war-related trauma have \naffected whole communities in the conflict-affected areas. Ethnic tensions have increased during this period of \ndeprivation and suffering resulting in renewed feelings of animosity among communities. Economic activities are not \nsustained and are not viable in an atmosphere of doubts, uncertainties, and lack of development.  \n \nIn the above context, continued efforts at improving existing services in the area with a focus on issues that would \nhave an immediate but lasting impact on the lives of the people is vital. The conflict-affected areas need to provide \nfacilities and services that would encourage people to return and to continue living in these areas. As such, \ninstitutional strengthening and capacity building are the need of the hour. Restoration of infrastructure alone is not \nsufficient if it is to provide optimum benefits and outreach. Therefore, facilities that would ensure continued activity and \ndelivery of adequate services of schools, agricultural extension services, and additional skills training programs toward \nbuilding a sustainable economic base in the areas are vital. This Project will therefore contribute to the restoration of \npeople\u2019s livelihoods, increasing social stability and ethnic harmony in the conflict-affected areas with equitable \ndistribution of benefits to help build a sound economy and cultivate an atmosphere of peace and human security. \n \n \nB.

Background \n \n1.  Sri Lanka is currently emerging from two decades of armed conflict, a conflict which itself \nstemmed from previous decades of accumulating social tensions. Consequences of the conflict \ninclude more than 60,000 people killed, more than 800,000 persons displaced internally, tens of \nthousands of families who have fled the country, physical infrastructure\u2014especially in the north \nand east\u2014devastated, an economy starved of investment and hobbled by insecurity, enormous \nsocial  trauma,  and  a  significant  deterioration  in  the  quantity  of  qualified  human  resources \navailable in both the social and economic spheres. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) \nsigned by the Government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in early 2002 \ngenerated fresh hope that a lasting peace could be negotiated and serve as a basis for the \nfuture development of the country. However, the suspension of negotiations by the LTTE in April \n2003, followed by a deepening political crisis in the south later in the year, have essentially \nresulted in forward progress in the formal peace process being brought to a halt, although \nsupport for peace remains robust. The general election planned for early April 2004 adds \nanother element of uncertainty to the overall picture. It is therefore essential that ADB remains a \nresponsive, effective, and sympathetic partner to Sri Lanka in its progress toward a lasting \npeace.  \n \n2.  Most of the conflict-affected areas, whether on the government or LTTE side, have been \nessentially devoid of new investment during the 20 years of armed conflict, although initial signs \nof  new  investment,  both  public  and  private,  have  begun  to  emerge  since  the  cease-fire \nagreement was signed in early 2002. On balance, the private sector plays a greater role in \neconomic life than it did 20 years ago. Taxes have become a controversial issue in LTTE-\ncontrolled areas, with the LTTE imposing various types of levies on individuals and companies \nin order to finance a portion of their activities. While reliable social statistics are not available for \nthe areas targeted by this project, anecdotal evidence from numerous aid agencies indicates \nthat social problems such as alcoholism, domestic violence, sexual abuse, drugs, and suicide \nsignificantly  increased  over  the  years  of  conflict.  Such  increases  suggest  widespread \npsychological trauma, alienation, and stress resulting from the breakdown of traditional social \nsupport networks. \n \n3.  Key actors who have an influence on the evolving conditions in the conflict-affected \nareas include the LTTE, who wish to ensure that peace will bring not only rehabilitation to the \nnorth and east, but also significant autonomy in the governance of the region, as reflected in \ntheir  proposal  (not  yet  discussed)  for  an  interim  administration  covering  the  northeastern \ndistricts. The Government, which controls about half of the conflict-affected areas, including \nJaffna,  sees  peace  and  the  ensuing  stability  as  an  essential  ingredient  in  relaunching  Sri \nLanka\u2019s economy. However, there are elements in the south who continue to actively promote \nthe dominance of the largest ethnic community, thus limiting the Government\u2019s scope to take \npeace initiatives and to make what are perceived by some as unacceptable concessions.  \n \nB.  Project Context \n \n4.  The Project will be implemented partly in government-controlled areas and partly in \nLTTE-controlled territory. Although the longer-term control of these areas will be the subject of \nfuture negotiations, for the moment, the boundaries are not actively contested by either party. \nThe political and security situation in the project area will depend greatly on the policies of the \nrecently-elected  government  and  their  approach  towards  peace  negotiations.  But  for  the \n ", "Appendix 14  53\nmoment, the context is generally stable, although punctuated by periodic reports of relatively \nminor breaches of the cease-fire agreement and of intimidation of local citizens and groups. \nEconomically, there has been some improvement since the cease-fire agreement in early 2002, \nwith some small-scale private investment, notably in the services sector, some increase in \nrehabilitation activities by aid organizations, and increased trade due to the opening of road \nlinks between LTTE- and government-controlled areas. It is expected that total aid flows will \nincrease significantly in 2004, on condition that there is not a fresh outbreak of armed hostilities, \nraising the issue of capacity constraints for both administrative structures and community-based \norganizations. Poverty remains endemic, with tens of thousands of internally displaced families \nlooking  to  resettle  in  their  places  of  origin.  Returns  since  the  ceasefire  have  significantly \naugmented the population of a number of districts such as Jaffna, Kilinochchi, and Mullaittivu \nthat had seen large outflows during the war.  \n \n5.  In areas of mixed ethnic composition, notably in the east, relations between the three \nmain groups (Tamil, Singhalese, and Muslim) remain volatile, despite the efforts of community \nleaders to establish conflict resolution mechanisms. Competition over limited resources and \ndisputed  land  rights  in  some  areas  are  flash  points  that  have  acted  as  triggers  for \nintercommunal  violence  on  recent  occasions.  Currently  many  Muslim  communities  feel \nmarginalized  in  debates  over  the  country\u2019s  future,  believing  their  specific  needs  are  not \nadequately taken into account and feeling under threat by the LTTE. Singhalese community \nmembers, especially those along the east coast, generally feel vulnerable to LTTE pressure and \ncomplain of not being adequately protected by the Government. Tamils are cautiously hopeful \nthat  the  LTTE  and  the  Government  will  eventually  return  to  the  negotiating  table.  All \ncommunities feel that their material conditions have not improved sufficiently since the MoU was \nnegotiated.  \n \n6.  The ethnic composition varies across the project area, with Tamils strongly dominating in \nthe north. In the districts in the east, the three main groups are relatively equally balanced. \nNevertheless,  individual communities tend to  be essentially mono-ethnic, thus  producing a \nschool system that is fragmented as well as communities that do not communicate easily with \neach other.  \n \n7.  Infrastructure in much of the project area, but especially the north, was destroyed or \nseverely damaged during the armed conflict, while the rest was not maintained and therefore \ndeteriorated due to lack of funds or access. Since the cease-fire, most people appear to feel \nthat their personal security has improved, but also fear the gains are fragile. Some studies, such \nas one commissioned by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) in 2002,1 \nsuggest  that  psychological  trauma  is  widespread  among  all  ages,  with  feelings  of  fear, \ndepression and helplessness being common. Children have been particular victims, not only \ndue to the psychological trauma suffered at an impressionable age, but also due to malnutrition \nthat has hampered their development, loss of years of schooling, and exposure to physical \ndangers  such  as  land  mines.  Many  women  have  suffered  the  trauma  of  losing  the  main \nbreadwinner in the family, obliging them to provide for their children and elder parents, often \nafter  being  forced  from  their  land.  In  addition,  the  conflict  environment  rendered  women \nparticularly vulnerable to sexual harassment.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Simms, Dr. Chris. 2002. Study on Psychosocial Distress in Sri Lanka. Colombo. \n ", "54 Appendix 14 \nC.  Prognosis \n \n8.  Despite the current political crisis in the south, the general trend since the MoU was \nsigned has been a gradual decrease in the overall level of tension in the country, although there \nis a clear sense that this decrease could easily be reversed. In addition, the trend does not \nexclude outbreaks of violence in specific locations as a result of local \u201ctriggers\u201d being set off by \nlocal issues. These issues tend to be related to competition for local resources, for example fish \nor  access  to  arable  land.  Because  of  the  lack  of  trust  and  effective  dispute-resolution \nmechanisms at higher levels, the danger is that these local triggers can cause wider eruptions \nof violence through contagion. There is also a danger of political entrepreneurs promoting \nextreme options in order to consolidate their following, thus engendering heightened inter-group \nhostility and tensions.  \n \n9.  Because specific ethnic groups tend to dominate in specific economic sectors, those \nimplementing the Project will need to be aware that certain subproject interventions might be \nperceived as favoring one group at the expense of another. Thus, they will need to consider not \nonly whether aid to one sector will achieve the desired outputs but also the potential impact on \nother groups in the area. In addition, they will need to ensure that the way aid is apportioned \nbetween different sectors allows for a reasonably equitable sharing of benefits among all ethnic \ngroups.  \n \n10.  Groups that may consider they could benefit from a re-escalation of tensions or even \nconflict include security forces on both sides whose influence and resources have expanded \ngreatly over the life of the conflict and could be expected to shrink if and as long-term peace \ntakes root. Thus demilitarization will become an issue if peace is to be consolidated.  \n \n11.  With regards to groups that can play a mitigating or transforming role in the event \nsociopolitical tensions worsen, there are numerous religious authorities of all faiths that appear \nwilling  to  contribute  at  both  the  local  and  provincial  levels.  There  are  also  a  number  of \nexperienced nongovernment organizations (NGOs) with extensive roots in the area, which have \ndeveloped both credibility and expertise in conflict mediation and transformation at the local \nlevel.  Finally,  a  number  of  community-based  organizations,  such  as  village  rehabilitation \ncommittees, have generated credible leaders over the past several years that could also be a \nuseful resource in constructively addressing local tensions. \n \n12.  The most likely scenario over the next few years is that the overall peace will hold, \ndespite periodic confrontations and outbreaks of violence. Transparent, effective, democratic \ngovernance meeting generally accepted international norms is however likely to continue to be \na concern in the near future, acting as a brake on the long-term development of the country, \nparticularly in the northeast but also in the south. As a result, the Project will need to pay \nparticular attention to the quality of its management and how the outputs connect with the \ngovernance structures that will be put into place as the peace process advances. \n \nD.  Project Parameters \n \n13.  A key to the project being perceived as providing a \u201cpeace dividend\u201d will be the extent to \nwhich target populations consider that benefits to them are being maximized. This means that \nnot only should the outputs be efficiently delivered but also that implementation methods favor \nthe maximization of benefits locally. For example, local labor should be used as much as \npossible while contracts and subcontracts should be designed to facilitate the participation and \nreinforcement of local contractors. Also, where work is to be implemented by civil society \n ", "Appendix 14  55\norganizations such as NGOs, attention should be accorded to strengthening their technical and \nmanagerial capacity as needed, in order to ensure not only the effectiveness of the work they \ncarry out but also their capacity to contribute to the future development of their area.  \n \n14.  The Project, as it is formulated, has the capacity to apportion benefits in an equitable \nmanner among the different ethnic groups, subject to the provisos mentioned earlier and subject \nto  ethnicity  being  one  of  the  criteria  (but  not  the  only  one)  used  in  targeting  specific \ncommunities. There is a risk that certain parts of the project may be temporarily destabilized by \nthe eruption of local tensions, but as long as tensions remain local, this destabilization is likely to \nbe of short duration. However, past experience indicates that the protection will be more cost \neffective if the Project, when it enters a new locality, takes the time to explain the objectives to \nlocal leaders and seeks to gain their endorsement. It will also be useful for the periodic reviews \nto include assessments of changes in the political and security environment and how/if they \nimpact on the Project, as well as how the Project appears to be impacting on peace and conflict \nfactors in the target areas.  \n \nE.  Correspondence between Project and Context \n \n15.  As  the  Project  responds  to  generally  recognized  needs,  the  support  for  such \ninterventions is by and large strong among government and LTTE representatives, as well as \namong community leaders. However, should negotiations with regards to a proposed interim \nadministration for the north and east eventually bear fruit, it will likely be necessary that ADB \ndiscuss carefully with the Government and the LTTE how decisions agreed at the negotiating \ntable affect implementation arrangements for the Project, within the parameters of the original \nloan agreement. The fact that the North East Community Development Project has gained \nconsiderable credibility and trust among all sociopolitical actors in the north and east over the \npast couple of years will be a significant asset in dealing with the inevitable tensions that will \nperiodically arise during implementation of the Project. \n \nF.  Projected Impacts \n \n16.  As long as the beneficial outcomes are shared reasonably equitably among the major \nethnic groups and across the target area, the Project is not expected to contribute to an \nintensification  of  social  tensions.  In  addition,  the  modest  nature  of  the  proposed  activities \nappears  to  make  them  unlikely  to  be  captured  by  elite  or  sectarian  interests.  Possible \ninadvertent negative outcomes for this type of project that will need to be monitored include \nopportunities for illegitimate profit taking on construction contracts and opportunities for levying \nvarious types of nontransparent taxes or fees.  \n \n17.  Regarding the potential for disillusionment among the beneficiary populations once they \nsee the actual outcomes delivered by the Project, the danger appears to be fairly modest, given \nthe  small-scale,  local  nature  of  the  outputs.  The  key  will  be  in  maintaining  complete \ntransparency with both the local authorities and the ultimate beneficiaries on what the Project \ncan  and  cannot  deliver  and  consulting  with  local  representatives  on  the  most  appropriate \nmethodology to adopt as the project advances. This includes being sensitive to any changes in \napproach  that  appear  to  be  advisable  in  light  of  changing  circumstances  over  the \nimplementation period.  \n \n ", "56 Appendix 14 \nG.  Conclusion \n \n18.  The Project as presented can potentially make a positive contribution to the rebuilding of \nthe infrastructure and socioeconomic fabric of the conflict-affected areas of Sri Lanka. The \nchallenge will be in implementing the Project in a conflict-sensitive manner, ensuring that: \n \n(i)  subprojects are selected in ways that ensure an ethnic balance that reasonably \nreflects the general ethnic composition of that area; \n(ii)  rigorous  measures  are  applied  to  limit  the  potential  of  corruption  diverting \nresources to local, subnational and national elites; \n(iii)  all phases of the project are characterized by transparency, so that the relevant \nauthorities,  community  leaders  and  beneficiaries  understand  the  project \nparameters and how it is progressing; and \n(iv)  implementation is done using local human and material resources as much as \npossible, encouraging a sense of ownership of the dividends flowing from the \ncease-fire. \n \n19.  Indicators that might be considered in order to track changes in the degree and nature of \ncommunal tensions and that could serve as warning (or reassuring) signs, include: \n \n(i)  the number of violent incidents involving four or more people\u2014averaged on a per \ncommunity basis\u2014within the previous 6 months;  \n(ii)  the number of disputes involving more than five households\u2014averaged on a per \ncommunity basis\u2014that have been resolved in a nonviolent manner in the past 6 \nmonths;  \n(iii)  the average total number of times each family in the village\u2014averaged on a per \ncommunity basis\u2014has traveled to another village or town in the previous month; \nand  \n(iv)  the judgment in community meetings whether the present security climate in their \narea is very poor, poor, fair, good, or very good.  \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20040616103903+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20040526163418+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R74-04", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}, "author_page": "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 1 May 2004)  \n \nCurrency Unit  \u2013  Sri Lanka rupee/s (SLRe/SLRs) \nSLRe1.00  =  $0.01     \n$1.00  =  SLRs98.850    \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \nADB    \u2013  Asian Development Bank \nCAARP  \u2013  Conflict Affected Areas Rehabilitation Project \nDPMU   \u2013  district project management unit \nGTZ    \u2013  Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit \n      (German Agency for Technical Cooperation) \nIA    \u2013  implementing agency \nIDP    \u2013  internally displaced person \nIEE     \u2013  initial environmental examination \nLCB    \u2013  local competitive bidding \nLTTE    \u2013  Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam \nMPCLG  \u2013  Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government \nNECORD  \u2013  North East Community Restoration and Development Project \nNEPC   \u2013  North East Provincial Council \nNGO    \u2013  nongovernment organization \nNPCC   \u2013  National Project Coordination Committee \nPMU    \u2013  project management unit \nPPCC   \u2013  Provincial Project Coordination Committee \n   \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December.  \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \n \nThis report was prepared by a team consisting of R.G.
