The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  strengthen  the \ncapacity of the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) of the Ministry of Communications \n(MOC)  to  conduct  a  comprehensive  assessment  for  social  and  poverty,  resettlement,  and \nenvironmental impacts of large-scale highway projects and to assist them in preparing such an \nassessment  and  measures  for  mitigating  the  adverse  impacts  of  expanding  the  Dhaka-\nChittagong highway (DCH) to four lanes in compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policy as well as \nthe Government\u2019s rules and regulations. A Fact-Finding Mission visited Bangladesh 20 \u2013 23 \nSeptember  2004.  The  Report  is  based  on  the  Mission\u2019s  findings  in  the  field  and  the \nunderstanding reached with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing \nplan, and implementation arrangements for the TA.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n \n2.  The  transport  system  in  Bangladesh  is  extensive  and  diversified,  comprising  about \n140,000 kilometers (km) of roads, 2,700 km of railways, 5,970 km of perennial and seasonal \nwaterways,  two major  seaports, and seven airports. The primary road network connecting \nnational and regional roads and district roads comprises 20,800 km, while the secondary roads \ntotal 115,000 km. National and regional roads and district roads are administered by RHD within \nMOC.  \n \n3.  RHD was founded in 1962 with a staff of 5,000, and 1,150 km of paved road under its \njurisdiction. RHD grew steadily and now has a staff of 20,000. RHD comprises three wings \n(mechanical,  technical  services,  and  network  management  and  build-operate-transfer)  and \nseven field zones, each headed by an additional chief engineer who reports directly to the chief \nengineer.  \n \n4.  RHD\u2019s  capacity  for  technical  engineering  has  proved  appropriate  in  undertaking  a \nnumber of large-scale road and bridge construction works. However, the capacity to address \nsocial (particularly resettlement) and environmental issues has been limited despite the clear \nneed for a mechanism to deal with such issues in RHD-wide projects and to respond to external \nfinancing agency requirements. In 1997, RHD set up the Road and Environment Circle (REC) \nstaffed with appropriately qualified personnel to review and monitor social and environmental \nissues in RHD projects. The achievement, however, did not meet expectations: because of \ninsufficient support from RHD management, particularly budgetary, REC could not take on \ngreater responsibilities in social and environmental issues.  \n \n5.  In 2000, RHD established the Social and Environment Circle (SEC) to strengthen its \ncapacity to adopt sound environmental management systems and socially responsible practices \nto ensure sustainable project development and implementation. SEC\u2019s mandate is to develop a \nframework  for  environmental  and  social  training  programs  for  RHD  and  formulate  a  work \nprogram for using established case studies on environmental impact assessment (EIA) and \nresettlement plans, and survey methods and practices to provide on-the-job training to RHD\u2019s \nproject  development  and  monitoring  staff.  SEC  is  also  mandated  to  monitor  construction \ncontracts to ensure that environmental concerns are addressed appropriately and to audit \nconstruction activities to ensure compliance. Even after the establishment of SEC, however, \nADB\u2019s road projects experienced considerable start-up delays caused by inappropriate land \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 27 August 2004 . ", "2  \nacquisition and resettlement plans and environmental management and monitoring plans, and \npoor implementation and monitoring of the action plans.  \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s special evaluation study2 conducted for ADB road projects3 identified several \nproblems in handling resettlement issues in Bangladesh. First, the national laws and legal \nframework used for project-induced displacement are inadequate to deal with displacement \nconsequences, particularly when it comes to assisting vulnerable groups. Second, RHD lacks \nexperience in resettlement and is institutionally weak to implement and manage involuntary \nresettlement. Monitoring and recording systems for resettlement activities have been weak. \nInstitutional capacity for planning, designing action plans, and implementing and managing \ninvoluntary resettlement needs to be improved.  \n \n7.  In 2003, ADB provided small-scale TA to enhance the capacity of RHD to manage \ninvoluntary resettlement. The TA enhanced awareness and understanding of ADB\u2019s policy on \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  strengthened  the  skills  of  RHD  staff  in  planning  and  managing \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  and  identified  key  areas  of  policy  interventions  necessary  for \nformulating  a  national  involuntary  resettlement  policy.  Two  TAs  for  developing  a  national \ninvoluntary resettlement policy programmed for 2004 and 2006, respectively, will be a follow-on \neffort to help the Government establish a national policy along with the national laws and legal \nframework for involuntary resettlement. \n \n8.  The DCH is the country\u2019s main transport corridor; it connects Chittagong, the port city in \nsoutheast, to Dhaka, and further up to the Jamuna Bridge linking the eastern and western parts \nof the country. The DCH was built with 2-lanes for most of its stretches and currently is unable \nto handle the high level of traffic. To accommodate the current level and expected high growth \nof traffic on the DCH, the Government decided to expand the DCH to a four-lane access-\ncontrolled expressway. The feasibility study and detailed design for four lanes are under way \nwith ADB financing.4 ADB\u2019s road sector development project programmed for 2006 will provide \npartial support to the Government\u2019s initiative to expand the DCH. \n \n9.  Since expanding the DCH to four lanes will involve substantive land acquisition and \nresettlement  and  is  likely  to  involve  critical  environmental  impacts,  an  extensive  and \ncomprehensive assessment of social and poverty, resettlement, and environmental impacts will \nbe  essential  for  the  success  of  the  project.  The  assessment  and  mitigating  measures  for \nadverse impacts should be in compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policy as well as with the \nGovernment\u2019s rules and regulations. The capacity of the fledgling SEC to address aid agencies\u2019 \nsafeguard policy issues and comply with their requirements needs strengthening.   \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2000.

", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n10.  The TA will strengthen the capacity of RHD to conduct a comprehensive assessment of \nthe social and poverty, resettlement, and environmental impacts of large-scale highway projects \nand assist the staff in preparing such an assessment and associated mitigating measures for \nthe DCH expansion, in compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policy as well as the Government\u2019s \nrules and regulations. The TA will also improve the efficiency and accuracy of the tasks of land \nacquisition, resettlement, and environmental impact assessment (EIA) during processing of the \nproject.  The  improvement  will  help  reduce  complaints  from  affected  people  and  minimize \ndisputes and related cost overruns during project implementation.  \n \n11.  The TA will produce (i) case-study-type manuals5 for social and resettlement impacts \nassessment, poverty impact assessment, and EIA of large-scale highway projects such as the \nexpansion of the DCH project; and (ii) social and poverty impact assessment, land acquisition \nand resettlement plans (LARPs), and EIA for the DCH project. The TA framework is in Appendix \n1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA will prepare socioeconomic and poverty profiles for the project areas to be \nserved by the expanded DCH. Data will come from statistical records, household surveys, \nvillage surveys (using participatory rapid appraisal techniques), and key informant interviews \nusing participatory community appraisal techniques. A survey will be conducted to develop a \nprofile of transport services and costs in the project areas; assess the level, viability, and quality \nof transport services; and propose interventions on how to maximize project benefits and make \ntransport services more available, efficient, and reliable. The information will also serve as a \nbaseline for performance monitoring. The TA will also assess how the proposed expansion of \nthe  DCH  will  help  improve  people\u2019s  incomes  and  livelihood.  On  the  basis  of  a  separate \neconomic  analysis,  the  TA  will  estimate  (i)  the  number  of  project  beneficiaries  by  area, \noccupation, and income level (poor, low, medium, and high); (ii) the number of adversely \naffected people by type of impact; and (iii) the poverty impacts. Performance monitoring and \nevaluation (M&E) systems will be developed with respect to social aspects focusing on the poor, \nethnic minorities, and women. \n \n13.  Resettlement household surveys will be conducted, particularly for seriously affected \nvillages to ensure adequate understanding of social impacts; develop indicators (which include \nextent of project impacts) and then identify seriously affected households; and quantify the \ntypes and degree of impacts on the affected people\u2019s income levels and sources, housing \nconditions, occupations, expenditure patterns, landholdings, skills base, and assets (production \nand living). The LARP will include village-level impact assessment of project-affected people, \nland,  assets  and  occupations,  impacts  on  each  ethnic  group  and  gender,  and  potential \nimpoverishment risks and vulnerable groups, including those severely affected through loss of \nland, those with low income, and others (e.g., disabled, elderly, unemployed, illiterate, women, \nchildren), as well as special mitigating measures. The TA will review the organizational structure \n                                                 \n5  RHD has prepared the guidelines for resettlement and environmental assessment for highway projects with support \nfrom the Department for International Development. All safeguard assessments for four-laning of Dhaka-Chittagong \nhighway will follow those guidelines that are in line with ADB\u2019s safeguard policy. The manual to be developed by \nthe TA will be a case study based on the actual safeguard assessments to be conducted for expansion of the \nDhaka-Chittagong highway and will be used for the building capacity of RHD staff. ", "4  \nand  capacity  for  resettlement  implementation  and  recommend  improvements  and  actions \nrequired before land acquisition starts.    \n \n14.  Environmental  conditions  in  the  project  areas  will  be  assessed:  natural  resources, \nforests, cultural sites, and historical monuments, as well as the current negative environmental \nimpacts resulting from industrial activities and road traffic. The EIA and summary EIA will be \nprepared on the basis of preliminary design data and an adequate level of public participation. \nIncremental costs of implementing the proposed environmental mitigating measures and other \nmeasures to minimize adverse environmental impacts will be estimated. Based on the EIA, an \nenvironmental monitoring and management plan will be prepared together with its estimated \ncost.  \n \n15.  In all activities, SEC staff will be involved to give them on-the-job training in assessing \nrelevant safeguards. All activities will be summarized as a case study in the form of manuals to \nprovide concerned RHD staff with hands-on experience in handling safeguard issues for large-\nscale highway projects. A workshop will be held to disseminate the findings of the safeguard \nassessments for expanding the DCH and to train the concerned RHD staff in using the case \nstudy.  After completion of the TA, SEC will play a focal role in safeguard assessments for all \naid-financed highway projects. The terms of reference are in Appendix 2.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent, comprising $364,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $261,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  provide  $500,000 \nequivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and a portion of the local currency cost \namounting to $136,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA \nfunding program. The Government will finance the remaining $125,000 equivalent to cover the \ncosts of surveys, office accommodation and support services, local communications, office \nsupply, and other facilities and services required for implementing the TA. Appendix 3 gives the \ndetailed cost estimates. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  RHD will be the Executing Agency for the TA. Within RHD, the superintending engineer \nin SEC will be the project director, and will be responsible for the TA\u2019s overall implementation in \ncoordination with the additional chief engineer. The project director will regularly report on TA \nprogress to ADB and ensure that the TA consultant interact with the consultants engaged for the \nfeasibility study and detailed design of the DCH project. RHD will appoint 2 executive engineers \nin SEC as project manager to manage the TA on a day-to-day basis. The project managers will \nreport to the project director and will be provided by RHD with appropriate support staff and \nfacilities.  All concerned SEC staff will be assigned to the relevant TA activities to participate in \nactual safeguard assessments to be conducted by the consultants.   \n \n18.  A team of international consultants in association with a domestic consulting firm will be \nengaged using the simplified technical proposal procedures based on the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic consultants.  \nThe TA will require 39 person-months of consulting services, 15 international and 24 domestic \nto carry out the TA as defined in the outline terms of reference (Appendix 2). The international \nconsultants will have expertise in (i) social and poverty impact assessment, (ii) land acquisition \nand  resettlement,  and  (iii)  EIA.  The  domestic  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  (i)  land ", "  5\nacquisition  and  resettlement,  (ii)  highway  engineering,  (iii)  poverty  impact  assessment  and \ntransport economics, and (iv) environment engineering. The consultants will closely coordinate \nwith the other consultant team to be engaged for the feasibility study and detailed design for \nexpanding the DCH, particularly in road alignment, initial environmental examination, and initial \nLARP to be prepared by the feasibility consultants. Equipment under the TA will be procured in \naccordance with arrangements satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n19.  The Government and ADB agree to include this TA under the Pilot Study for Delegation \nof Consultant Recruitment and Supervision under Technical Assistance to Executing Agencies \n(pilot  study)6  approved  by  ADB.  In  particular,  the  Government  agreed  to  follow  the \nimplementation procedures outlined in the pilot study and such other detailed procedures and \npractices as ADB may require from time to time. The Government has acknowledged that the \nterms and conditions of the Technical Assistance Framework Agreement (TAFA) executed \nbetween the Government and ADB on 5 February 1996 apply to this TA. Pursuant to Section \n3.01 of the TAFA, ADB agreed to delegate consultant selection and supervision for firms under \nthis TA to the Government. The TA Letter Agreement to be issued under the TAFA for this TA \nwill reflect this arrangement.  \n \n20.  The  consulting  services  will  be  carried  out  over  6  months,  with  TA  completion  by \nFebruary 2006. RHD will provide ADB and the consultants with the feasibility study, engineering \nstudies, initial environment examination, initial LARP, and any other materials, recent studies, \nand reports required to implement the TA.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Bangladesh  for  Support  to  the  Roads  and  Highways  Department  for \nSafeguard Policy Compliance, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2003.

Specific Tasks \n \n1.  The services to be provided by the consultants will cover, but will not be limited to, the \nfollowing areas.  \n \n1.  Social and Poverty Impact Assessment \n \n2.  The consultants will prepare socioeconomic and poverty profiles for the project areas to \nbe served by the proposed expansion of Dhaka-Chittagong highway (DCH) to four lanes. Data \nwill come from statistical records, household surveys, village surveys (using participatory rapid \nappraisal techniques) and key informant interviews (e.g., government officials in concerned \nprovinces,  women\u2019s  federation,  business  associations,  community  groups,  etc.)  using \nparticipatory community appraisal techniques. The information will include population, income \nlevels,  occupations,  unemployment,  education  levels,  health  conditions,  and  other  relevant \nsocioeconomic data by income group, ethnic group, and gender, where applicable. Data and \nprofiles should be sufficiently comprehensive to serve as the baseline for socioeconomic benefit \nmonitoring. \n \n3.  The consultants will conduct a survey to develop a profile of transport services and costs \nin the project areas; assessing the variety of transport services available and people\u2019s access to \nthem  and  to  the  existing  and  planned  road  infrastructure;  analyze  intermediate  means  of \ntransport in the project area, identify types of transport services affordable to the poor, assess \nthe level, viability, and quality of transport services in the project area; prepare maps showing \nschools and health facilities in the project area and indicate how the Project will improve access \nto  these  services,  investigate  both  supply  and  demand  issues,  including  transport-seeking \nbehavior of the poor and those residing in remote areas, suggest interventions on how to \nmaximize project benefits, and how to make transport services more available, efficient, and \nreliable. This information will also serve as a baseline for performance monitoring. \n \n4.  The  consultants  will  analyze  how  the  proposed  road  development  project  will \ncomplement  the  Government\u2019s  development  programs,  and  consult  with  local  government \noffices to identify development initiatives that could complement the roads project, particularly \nthose targeted at the poor and ethnic minorities, and identify possible sources of funding for \nthese initiatives. \n \n5.  On the basis of the initial poverty and social assessment, the consultants will conduct \npoverty and social analysis in accordance with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Handbook \non Poverty and Social Analysis and Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact in the Economic \nAnalysis  of  Projects,  and  assess  how  the  proposed  expansion  of  DCH  will  help  improve \npeople\u2019s incomes and livelihood. A separate economic analysis will estimate (i) the number of \nproject beneficiaries by area, occupation, and income level (poor, low, medium and high); (ii) the \nnumber of adversely affected people by type of impact; and (iii) the poverty impacts. The \nconsultants will specify how the Project will improve benefits (market access, employment \nopportunities, lower transport costs, reduced travel time, access to health and education, etc.) to \nlocal people by income group, recommend measures to enhance benefits and minimize adverse \nimpacts, particularly on the poor, women, ethnic minorities and other vulnerable groups, discuss \nthe proposed action with the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) and formulate a social \naction plan, ethnic minorities development plan, or gender plan, as applicable, and clearly \npropose the cost of such measures and the means for implementing them. \n ", "  Appendix 2  9\n \n   \n6.  The consultants will develop the performance monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems \nfor social aspects focusing on the poor, ethnic minorities, and women, collect baseline data for \ntarget  performance  indicators  as  prescribed  in  the  Technical  Assistance  (TA)  framework, \ndevelop a reporting format; and show how indicators will be measured, and baselines and \ntargets quantified. \n \n7.  The social and poverty surveys and analysis should provide adequate coverage for \ninvestigations  and  consultations  with  ethnic  minorities,  in  relation  to  potential  impacts  or \npossible  enhancement  of  project  benefits.  If  this  analysis  shows  the  need  for  an  ethnic \nminorities  development  plan  (EMDP),  the  consultant  will  help  RHD  prepare  the  EMDP  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Indigenous  People\u2019s  Policy  and  ADB\u2019s  Gender  Policy  and  reach \nagreement with the RHD on the mechanisms for implementation. The EMDP should contain an \naction, budget, implementation arrangements, and an M&E plan, include a plan for continuous \ninternal  monitoring  and  supervision  by  RHD,  and  a  plan  for  periodic  external  M&E  by  an \nindependent agency with semi-annual reports during implementation. The EMPD should have a \n5-page executive summary. The consultants will help RHD distribute the summary EMDP to all \naffected townships and villages. Bangladeshi versions of the approved EMDP will subsequently \nbe distributed to all relevant local government offices. \n \n8.  The consultants will help RHD establish consultation and participatory processes for the \nEMDP that will be implemented during project design, construction, and operation, identify \nstakeholders and consult representatives so their needs and demands can be incorporated into \nthe Project or taken as parallel initiatives; prepare a public participation and consultation status \nreport and plan for project implementation, which will be managed by RHD. The consultation \nplan can have environment and resettlement aspects. \n \n9.  The consultants will help RHD establish consultation and participatory processes for use \nduring project preparation and throughout project design, construction, and operation; identify \nstakeholders and consult representatives so their needs and demands can be incorporated into \nthe Project or taken as parallel initiatives; prepare an overall stakeholder participation and \nconsultation report, containing details of consultation meetings, including responsible agencies, \ndate, the number and occupation of participants, and their responses; assess any potential role \nfor  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  in  the  project;  and  prepare  a  participation  or \nconsultation plan for project implementation, which will be managed by RHD. The plan can have \nethnic minorities, environment, and resettlement aspects.  \n \n2.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Planning \n10.  The consultants will conduct resettlement household surveys1 and surveys of seriously \naffected  villages  to  ensure  adequate  understanding  of  social  impacts;  develop  indicators \n(showing extent of project impacts) and identify seriously affected households; and quantify the \ntypes  and  degree  of  impacts  on  the  affected  people\u2019s  income  levels  and  sources,  housing \nconditions, occupations, expenditure patterns, landholdings, skills base, and assets (production \nand living). \n \n11.  The consultants will prepare the resettlement plan (RP) documenting how the project \ndesign and alignment have avoided or minimized land acquisition and displacement of people \nand  businesses.  The  RP  must  include  village-level  impact  assessment  of  project-affected \n                                                 \n1 For household surveys, ADB requires at least 10% of affected people and enterprises and 20% of seriously affected \npeople. The number of surveys can be finalized during the inception phase. ", "10   Appendix 2 \n \npeople, land, assets and occupations. The consultants will also assess the impacts on each \nethnic  group  and  gender;  identify  potential  impoverishment  risks  and  vulnerable  groups, \nincluding those severely affected through loss of land, those with low income, and others (e.g., \ndisabled,  elderly,  unemployed,  illiterate,  women,  children);  and  develop  special  mitigating \nmeasures, as required.  \n \n12.  In collaboration with RHD and local government officials, the consultants will define \ncategories of impact and compensation eligibility of affected people; prepare an entitlements \nmatrix covering compensation and other assistance for all types of impacts to achieve full \nreplacement for lost assets, income, and livelihood; and explain why the proposed mitigating \nand livelihood restoration measures are sustainable. The entitlements must be based on the \nAcquisition  and  Requisition  of  Immovable  Property  Ordinance,  1982  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \ninvoluntary resettlement.  \n \n13.  To restore the incomes of affected people and host people in seriously affected villages, \nthe  consultants  will  prepare  village  economic  rehabilitation  plans  in  collaboration  with  local \ngovernment offices and RHD and will append the plans to the RP. Specific measures for the \nseverely affected, the poor, ethnic minorities or other vulnerable households will be identified.  \n \n14.  The  consultants  will  assist  RHD  and  relevant  local  government  officials  to  expand \nconsultation with the affected communities, local leaders, proponents, and stakeholders who \nmay be opposed to the Project; assess stakeholders concerns and consider possible changes \nin  the  project  design  to  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  effects;  prepare  a \nconsultation plan for RHD and a format for documenting consultation with affected persons, \nlisting events and summarizing the outcomes and improvements resulting from consultation; \nhelp RHD prepare a resettlement information booklet2 and distribute copies to all affected \nvillages and households; and ensure that the draft RP information booklet is disclosed to \naffected persons and their comments incorporated into revisions. Bangladeshi versions of the \nRP will subsequently be distributed to all relevant local government offices and affected village \nleaders. \n \n15.  The RP should be based on preliminary design data.  The consultants will verify that the \ncompensation standards are based on replacement value and that the overall resettlement \nbudget  is  sufficient  to  acquire  the  land  and  implement  the  RP  based  on  the  proposed \nentitlements and rehabilitation plans. The RP will have a 5-page executive summary.   \n \n16.  The  consultants  will  review  the  organization  structure  and  capacity  to  implement \nresettlement and recommend improvements and actions required before land acquisition starts; \nand help RHD prepare a detailed resettlement implementation schedule that is linked to the \noverall project schedule. The key milestones for resettlement supervision should be developed \nand agreed to by RHD and ADB before the RP is finalized. The RP will also include a plan for \ncontinuous internal monitoring and supervision by RHD, and a plan for periodic external M&E by \nan independent agency with semiannual reports during resettlement implementation, and annual \nreports  upon  completion  of  resettlement  and  for  2  years  thereafter  or  until    economic \nrehabilitation is successfully completed. \n \n3.  Environmental Impact Assessment \n17.  The consultants will prepare the (i) environmental impact assessment (EIA) including the \nenvironmental management and monitoring plan (EMMP) on the basis of preliminary design \n                                                 \n2 ADB has sample formats available. ", "  Appendix 2  11\n \n   \ndata and in accordance with (a) ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines, 2003; (b) The \nADB\u2019s Environmental Policy; and (c) the Government\u2019s environmental acts, regulations, and \nguidelines; and (ii) a summary EIA in ADB format.   \n \n18.  The  EIA  should  address  direct  and  indirect  environmental  impacts  as  well  as \naccumulated impacts during construction and operation of the Project such as borrow pits or \nother activities to supply construction materials. The area covered by the EIA should be defined \nas not only the project location but also areas that will be potentially affected by the Project. The \nEIA should be based on primary data of environmental conditions such as air quality, water \nquality, vegetation coverage, etc. to provide a clear picture of environmental conditions, and \nalso on secondary data if available. If the project site and potential area are in a sensitive \nlocation  such  as  important  wetlands,  forests,  or  other  protected  areas  such  as  wildlife \nsanctuaries,  primary  data  should  also  be  collected.    The  potential  impact  and  mitigating \nmeasures  should  be  assessed  during  preconstruction,  construction,  and  operation.    The \npotential impacts and the incremental environmental costs to execute the Project should be \nassessed against expected environmental benefits quantitatively, where possible. \n \n19.  The consultants will prepare the EMMPs based on the EIA; clearly define the costs to \nimplement the EMMPS as well as institutional arrangements with potential third parties (e.g., \nNGOs or community-based organizations for implementing the plans; and prepare a training \nplan, if necessary, for parties involved in implementing the EMMPs.  \n \n20.  The consultants will ensure adequate consultations with the public during the EIA and \npreparation of the EMMP to disclose information related to the Project and its potential impacts. \nThe EIA report should record public acceptance of the Project, and the public\u2019s views and \nconcerns. \n \n4.  Training, Case Study, and Workshop \n \n21.  The consultants will prepare an on-the-job training program spelling out how to involve \nSocial and Environment Circle (SEC) staff in the TA for assessing safeguards, together with \nterms  of  reference  for  SEC  staff  to  be  assigned  to  assess  safeguards;  guide  SEC  staff \nparticipating in safeguard assessments in accordance with the terms of reference; prepare a \nmonthly report of progress and achievement of the on-the-job training program and evaluation \nof  performance  of  trainees;  and  prepare  a  final  report  on  the  program  that  evaluates \nachievements and recommends future actions.  \n \n22.  The  consultants  will  develop  case  study-type  manuals  for  assessing  social  and \nresettlement,  poverty,  and  environmental  impacts  of  large-scale  highway  projects  that \nsummarize all activities undertaken to assess the safeguard policy issues in expanding DCH to \nfour lanes. \n \n23.  The consultants will organize a 2-day workshop to disseminate the findings of the TA \nand train RHD staff on safeguard assessments using the case study manuals; and prepare the \nworkshop  proceedings  and  an  evaluation  report  on  the  workshop  that  includes \nrecommendations on how to make better use of the case study manuals. \n  \nB.  Reporting Requirements \n \n24.  The consultants will prepare the following reports and documents for the Government \nand ADB, and will submit each report in the numbers indicated.
