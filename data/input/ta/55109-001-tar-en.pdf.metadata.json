INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the Government of the \nKyrgyz Republic in developing and increasing the capacity for information technology (IT)-enabled \nservices in electronic procurement (e-procurement). This will be achieved by digitalizing the \ngovernment\u2019s e-procurement system and shifting all procurement transactions online with better \nfunctionality and security. The TA will (i) develop new software to replace paper-based operations, \n(ii) modernize existing software, and (iii) procure equipment to implement the enhanced system. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country operations business \nplan for Kyrgyz Republic, 2021\u20132023.1 The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and will \ncontribute to the operational priority of strengthening governance and institutional capacity.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The government implemented its e-procurement system (e-GP) during 2013\u20132016 with \nTA from ADB.3 Since 2015, all government agencies and state-owned enterprises have used e-\nGP to process their procurement transactions. The government estimates that e-GP reduces \nprocurement costs by 10% on average and enables the government and the public to verify all \nagencies\u2019 procurement planning and transactions online. It also added an effective complaint \nmechanism, which improved bidder participation.4 However, three major problems with e-GP \nhave become apparent: (i) limited functionality and security lapses, (ii) several paper-based \nprocurement steps that should be digitalized, and (iii) outdated data management infrastructure \nthat lacks capacity. Solving these problems would save additional procurement time and costs, \nas well as promote transparency and efficiency in public procurement administration. \n \n4.  Since being introduced, e-GP\u2019s software has not been updated to improve functionality \nand is increasingly out of date.  Updating the software using the latest information technologies \nwill make e-GP more effective in terms of output (more operations processed) and required inputs \n(hardware capacity) and reduce security-related threats. Because of resource limitations, the first \nTA to implement e-GP (footnote 3) could not cover all procurement processes and create an end-\nto-end system. Instead, a partially online system was developed that covers preparation of the \nprocurement plan and advertising, online issuance of bidding documents, and bid submission and \nopening.  Bid  evaluation;  contract  award,  generation,  and  signing;  contract  implementation; \nmonitoring; and payments are still processed on paper. New software needs to be developed to \nshift  these  transactions  online.  Further,  the  equipment  for  data  management  (servers  and \nauxiliary equipment) were purchased in 2015 and are now past their useful lifetime and working \nat maximum capacity. The envisaged improvement of e-GP will require updated equipment with \nadditional capacity.  \n \n5.  ADB assistance is needed because the country has limited expertise with IT systems for \ne-procurement, coupled with insufficient resources to finance digital transformation in the sector. \nHowever, the government has a strong commitment to digital transformation. As the first e-\nprocurement project demonstrated, the government has the capacity to maintain such e-platforms. \nThis TA aims to make the new e-GP system financially self-sufficient by introducing subscription \nfees for bidders.      \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 December 2020. \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n3  ADB.

This TA will build on the results of a previous TA during 2013\u20132016, which helped develop \nand launch the government\u2019s e-GP system. The TA completion report recommended to \u201ccontinue \nenhancing the performance, usability, and functionality of the e-GP system.\u201d5 This new TA will be \na continuation of the joint efforts of ADB and the government to promote development through \ndigitalization and greater use of services enabled by information and communication technology \n(ICT). \n \n7.  In 2020, in response to the government\u2019s request, ADB initiated small-scale TA to help \nsolve e-GP\u2019s urgent problems. Limited hardware capacity caused major shutdowns, and bidders \nlodged numerous complaints about the confidentiality of price bids submitted through e-GP.6 The \nsmall-scale TA helped the Public Procurement Department (PPD) of the Ministry of Economy and \nFinance (i) implement asymmetric encryption to provide security and confidentiality of bids; (ii) \nintroduce  e-signatures  to  replace  paper  signing  and  provide  better  authentication  and \nconfirmation of transactions, including bid submissions; (iii) purchase equipment to increase the \nsystem\u2019s capacity; and (iv) prepare a road map for completion of e-GP digitalization. The road \nmap is the basis for this knowledge and support TA. The IT consultant under the small-scale TA \ndefined the scope of work needed to complete the digitalization and estimated a total cost of $1.6 \nmillion. This TA will finance an initial set of activities for $1.0 million during 2021\u20132025. In 2023, \nfollow-up TA or additional financing will be proposed to complete the full digitalization of the e-GP \nsystem during 2023\u20132026.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  improvement  of  public  procurement \nadministration in the Kyrgyz Republic7 through greater use of ICT.8 The TA will have the following \noutcome: improved functionality of e-GP with at least 80% of procurement transactions performed \nonline.9 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: New e-GP modules developed and existing modules enhanced. The \nfollowing transactions and functions will be transitioned to the e-GP system: (i) external IT \nsystems integration (including data exchange and ICT integration with other state agencies to \nconfirm a firm\u2019s registration, taxes paid, and licenses); (ii) bid and contract security submission \nusing blockchain technology; (iii) bid evaluation (technical and financial) and identification of the \nwinning bidder; and (iv) contract award and notification. The remaining functions, such as e-\npayment, an English version of the website, report generation, and other enhancements, will be \naddressed in the follow-up TA. The project will also enhance existing modules by upgrading the \nsystem\u2019s software.  \n \n \n5  ADB. 2016. Technical Assistance Completion Report: Implementing the e-Procurement System.

Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n ", "3 \n10.  Output 2: IT audit performed. For e-GP, the confidence of both purchasers (government \nagencies) and bidders (private businesses) in the security and confidentiality of the system is of \nparamount importance. An IT audit firm will study the e-GP system before new software is \ndeveloped (output 1) and recommend improvements that will be implemented by a software \ndevelopment firm. After the new software is developed and put into service, the IT audit firm will \nperform a final audit to confirm the security and reliability of the e-GP system. \n \n11.  Output  3:  Equipment  for  data  management  purchased.  New  IT  equipment  will \naccommodate a larger and more sophisticated software system needed to achieve the project \noutcome \n \n12.  Innovative features. TA will help the government fully digitalize its e-procurement system \nwith advanced ICT. New modules to replace paper-based operations and upgrade existing ones \nwill be developed or updated using new and updated technology. This will result in an advanced \nend-to-end e-procurement system, matching international best standards. Additionally, the bid \nand contract security submission function will incorporate blockchain technology, which will be \nthe first such system in Central Asia. This will replace paper-based bank guarantees with online \nsubmissions; blockchain technology will be used to verify and authenticate such guarantees.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7) and $500,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund (EAKPF) and \nadministered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n14.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation for consultants, Internet connection, access to e-GP software and hardware, \ninformation and documents relevant to TA implementation, and other in-kind contributions.10 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA and its Kyrgyz Republic Resident Mission will select, supervise, \nand evaluate the consultants and monitor the quality of their work. The Ministry of Finance of the \nKyrgyz Republic will be the executing agency; the ministry\u2019s PPD will be the implementing agency, \nresponsible for coordinating with the relevant government agencies and organizations. The TA \nwill be implemented over 50 months from November 2021 to December 2025. The TA resources \nwill be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as \namended from time to time). The TA does not require logistical support from PPD. \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department\u2019s Digital Technology \nfor Development Unit and the Procurement, Portfolio and Financial Management Department will \nbe informed on the project\u2019s progress, and their advice will be sought on the project\u2019s key issues. \n \n17.  ADB  is  preparing  the  Central  Asian  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  Digitalization \nStrategy, which is scheduled for approval in 2021. The project will also coordinate activities with \nthe Kyrgyz Ministry of Digital Development, which is the nodal agency for all ICT-related activities \nin the country. \n \n10 Counterpart support to be provided by the Public Procurement Department under the Ministry of Economy and \nFinance  \n \n ", "4 \n \n18.
