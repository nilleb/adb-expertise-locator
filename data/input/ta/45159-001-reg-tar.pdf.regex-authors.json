INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Review (ADR) is the scholarly journal of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). Strategy 2020 mandates that ADB engage in forward-looking research in support \nof knowledge creation for its developing member countries.1 \n \n2.  The rationale for this technical assistance (TA) is that ADB needs to position the ADR as \na key venue for publication and distribution of scholarly research on topics relevant to ADB\u2019s \ninstitutional franchise.2 It aims to gradually increase the level of awareness of the ADR and \nenhance its reputation in both academic and policy-making circles by ensuring that articles are \nwritten with academic rigor and that policy implications and prescriptions are based on sound \ntheoretical  considerations,  backed  by  empirical  evidence.3  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Declining awareness and readership of the Asian Development Review. The ADR \nhas a history of good readership and reputation for quality in both academic and policy-making \ncircles. Its decline in readership and circulation from 2002 to 2010 is most likely attributable to \nthe rise of a number of alternative journals, likewise specializing in development issues, which \nare accredited in the social science citation index (SSCI). Since universities and other academic \ninstitutions use publications in SSCI-listed journals as the main criteria for tenure and promotion, \nADR\u2019s status as a non-SSCI journal makes it less attractive to academic researchers as a \nvenue  for  communicating  scholarly  work.  An  SSCI  listing  is  akin  to  a  seal  of  Good \nHousekeeping, ensuring that a journal adheres to set standards. Economists in the region have \nbetter incentives to publish in SSCI-listed journals in order to gain credibility as experts among \nthe academic community as well as in policy-making circles. The waning attractiveness of the \nADR as a venue for publication also negatively affects readership, since researchers tend to \nlexicographically  order  their  reading  toward  SSCI-listed  journals  before  going  to  other \nalternatives. The declining awareness of the ADR as a reference material for scholarly research \non Asian development issues is a long-term consequence of its waning attractiveness as a \nvenue for publication and its chronic decline in readership. \n \n4.  Need to raise the profile of the Asian Development Review. In line with Strategy \n2020, raising the profile of ADR is important for the operationalization of ADB\u2019s strategy. The \nADR provides a venue for publication of rigorous research that adheres to academic standards, \nand is a potentially effective tool to support ADB\u2019s position as one of the region\u2019s premier \nknowledge centers.  \n \n5.  Inclusion in the social science citation index listing. In order to raise ADR\u2019s profile, it \nmust be included in the SSCI listing. To achieve this, articles in the ADR must be at least as \nrigorously written as those published in other SSCI-listed journals covering similar or related \nresearch topics. To ensure that an adequate number of scholarly articles are acquired, ADB can \ninvite other Asian research institutions to collaborate with it to achieve the goal of attaining an \nSSCI listing. In order to increase the number of high-quality, scholarly submissions the ADR \n                                                \n1 ADB.2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2 The concept paper was approved by the Office of the Chief Economist, Economics and Research Department in \nOctober 2011. \n3 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 October 2011. \n \n ", "2   \nmust strengthen its review and editorial capacity, initially through the inclusion of heads of \npartner research institutions on the editorial board. The marketing and distribution of the ADR \nmust be intensified to ensure that a virtuous cycle of submissions that comply with the minimum \nacademic rigor, journal citations, and readership, are obtained in the medium term. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.         Impact and Outcome \n6.  The research and development TA will raise the profile of ADB\u2019s flagship research \npublications to further enhance ADB\u2019s reputation as a knowledge center in the region. It will also \nexpand ADB\u2019s influence on policy making in the region through scholarly research based on \nsound theoretical frameworks and whose policy implications are backed by rigorous empirical \nevidence. A listing in the SSCI, an increased number of citations, and ADR\u2019s impact factor will \nbe indicators of ADB\u2019s recognition as a knowledge center in the region. \n \n7.  The outcome of enhanced quality of article submissions will be achieved through more \nstringent editorial controls and tightened standards. Together with improved distribution, this \nshould increase ADR\u2019s readership within the first year of the RDTA. Minimum requirements on \nthe quality of articles, required for SSCI listing, will be imposed by the latter half of the second \nyear of the RDTA. The demand for the ADR and its contents will be gauged primarily by the \nnumber of views and downloads of its electronic format and the number of print subscriptions. \nADB is targeting an annual increase of 15% in the number of views and downloads of the \nelectronic format and 10% in the number of subscriptions. \n \n8.  The TA will result in the medium-term objective of having the ADR listed in the SSCI. \nGiven ADR\u2019s current state, scholars have a disincentive to submit their work as they will not \nreceive the publication points they need for tenure and promotion. ADR\u2019s inclusion in the SSCI \nwill effectively remove this disincentive and increase the number of quality article submissions. \nAmong other requirements, the Thomson Reuters assessment process for inclusion in the SSCI \nrequires  three  successive  issues  of  a  candidate  journal  to  be  submitted.4  The  application \nprocess for SSCI listing will therefore take 2 years, as ADB intends to initially issue the ADR \nbiannually. \n \nB.        Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  To facilitate the acquisition of scholarly articles, conferences will be held in 2012 and \n2013 for each biannual issue of the ADR. Four months before the conferences, six experts in a \nspecific field will be invited to conduct research on topics consistent with ADB\u2019s research \nagenda. Upon acceptance of the invitation, each researcher will be given a specific research \ntopic for which he or she shall submit a research proposal within the first month of engagement. \nAfter a proposal review and acceptance, the researcher will conduct the research and submit a \ndraft  article  within  4  months.  Two  resource  persons  will  be  engaged  a  month  before  the \nconference to comment and provide constructive input on the drafts. The conferences provide a \nvenue for researchers to present their papers so that the resource persons and editorial staff \ncan provide comments and suggestions for improvement. A panel discussion will also be held to \nensure a robust interchange of ideas. At the end of the conference, each researcher will have \nclose to two months to revise and finalize their papers and submit final copies to the editorial \noffice for review and acceptance. The ADR publishes electronic copies in June and December \n                                                \n4 Thomson Reuters owns SSCI \n ", "  3 \nof  each  year.  Printed  copies  are  subject  to  a  2-month  delay  due  to  logistics.  All  articles \npublished in the ADR shall adhere to standards similar to those imposed on leading SSCI-listed \njournals. Details of the timetables for the engagement of consultants, conferences, and journal \nreleases are in Appendix 1. \n \n10.  The TA is related to the proposed development of an Asia Research Network (ARN), \nemulating the Global Development Network, which was initially sponsored by the World Bank. \nThis initiative could potentially yield large benefits to ADB and its research partners. ERD aims \nto adopt the Global Development Network model to develop a network of researchers, including \nADB staff, in Asia and the Pacific. The pool of researchers within the ARN is a potential source \nof expertise for research on specific topics, with the objective of publishing journal-quality \narticles in the ADR. The ADR will initiate a call for papers within the ARN at least 8 months \nbefore the next publication date. All submissions will be subjected to the same peer review and \neditorial process to ensure that minimum standards are met.  \n \n11.  ERD will explore the possibility of working with ADB-related institutions, such as the \nAsian Development Bank Institute, to facilitate the process of raising ADR\u2019s profile. If ERD could \norganize two to four conferences together with these institutions, they could yield a significant \nnumber of scholarly papers, which could be published in regular or special issues of the ADR. If \nthis is done regularly, then the ADR could increase the number of issues it published in any \ngiven year beyond the current two to perhaps three or four, without significantly increasing its \nresource requirements. \n \n12.  The objective of increased readership and number of journal citations will be supported \nby heightened marketing and distribution efforts to academics, policy makers, and nonpartisan, \nnonpolitical research institutions. Partnerships with the latter shall be explored, especially if \nthese do not maintain their own academic research publications. Distribution will be enhanced \nby  working  with  a  reputable  academic  publisher  (e.g.,  Oxford  University  Press,  Elsevier \nScience) and journal databases like EBSCO Information Services. Engaging a professional \npublisher also increases visibility since it normally promotes its clientele as well as providing \nproductivity  and  monitoring  platforms  (i.e.,  an  electronic  document  submission  system,  an \nauthor and referee tracking system, and a citation counter). An SSCI listing will further improve \nelectronic accessibility. \n \n13.  The ADR will be made available in electronic and print formats. Until an academic \npublisher is engaged, the electronic format will be made available through ADB\u2019s website for \nfree, and will be promoted in coordination with the Department of External Relations (DER). \nERD will coordinate with DER on strategies for the promotion and distribution of printed and \nelectronic copies of the ADR. Printed copies of the ADR will be priced to recover the costs of \nprinting and distribution. \n \n14.  ERD staff will manage the TA. International experts will be hired to conduct research and \nsubmit articles for publication. Consultants will also be engaged to act as resource persons and \nto  provide  comments  and  suggestions,  in  effect  acting  as  peer  reviewers.  In  addition  to \nconsultants and resource persons, a copy editor will also be hired. The scope of work and \noutline of the terms of reference for international and national consultants are in Appendix 2. All \nconsultants and resource persons will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n15.  Although the ADR is currently planned for a biannual release, ERD will explore the \npossibility of special or supplementary issues, possibly through a partnership agreement with \n ", "4   \nother departments within ADB, ADB-related institutions, and nonpartisan and politically neutral \nresearch institutions. The department is also considering hiring a managing editor, given the \nprojected increase in the volume of articles that will need to be reviewed. He or she will be given \nincentives to bring the ADR into the SSCI listing within 2\u20133 years. \n \n16.  Risks  and  assumptions.  The  desired  outcome  of  an  SSCI  listing  presupposes \nsustaining the quality of articles and ADR\u2019s editorial processes. Over the timeframe of the TA, a \nkey risk is the unavailability or lack of interest of top-tier technical experts and consultants to \nparticipate in workshops and subsequently generate high-quality articles. Another risk, albeit a \nmore  manageable  one,  is  the  potential  incompatibility  of  expertise  between  primary \ninvestigators and resource persons. The above magnifies the risk of a commissioned paper\u2019s \nfailure to meet the minimum standards required of SSCI-listed journals. Another risk is the lack \nof  effective  or  inadequate  promotion  and  distribution  channels,  which  pose  constraints  on \ndesired outcomes even if an SSCI listing is obtained. One upside is the possibility of internally \nsourcing ADR articles from papers produced within ADB\u2019s departments and Communities of \nPractice. Assuming these pass editorial review, they would provide a cost-effective source of \nquality content.5 Given the above considerations, the risk that experts will be unavailable will be \nmitigated  through  a  sufficiently  long  lead  time  for  journal  issues.  Relevant  and  effective \nfeedback from resource persons will be obtained during and after conferences and workshops. \nLastly, it is assumed that the overwhelming majority of research papers will meet the minimum \nrequirement for scholarly articles, given effective peer review and editorial processes. \n \nC.        Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000 equivalent, and will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.        Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The TA will begin on 15 December 2011 and will be completed by 28 February 2014. \nThe closing date should be 30 June 2014. ADB will be the executing agency, and the Office of \nthe Chief Economist within ERD will take the lead in the implementation. ERD will coordinate \nwith DER in the publication, promotion, and distribution of electronic and printed copies of the \nADR.  \n \n19.  A part-time editorial consultant (international) will be engaged for 24 months to assist \neditorial staff with charting the attainment of medium-term objectives for the ADR, inclusive of \neditorial process improvements and editorial board changes. He or she will also provide support \nfor the improvement of article quality and ADR readership. The option of having a full-time editor \nis under consideration, but must be approached through alliance building (para. 15). The use of \na professional publisher (e.g., Oxford University Press) will be considered, since this would \nprovide extensive marketing and promotion. \n \n20.  Eight  international  consultants  will  be  engaged  every  6  months  during  the  TA\u2019s \nimplementation period. Of the eight, six will conduct research and present findings, and each \nwill submit a scholarly article for publication at the end of the sixth month. Two consultants will \n                                                \n5 Incentive systems for ADB staff whose papers successfully pass editorial review could be defined together with \nADB\u2019s Budget, Personnel and Management Systems Department. \n \n ", "  5 \nact as resource persons, providing comments and guidance to researchers on the conduct, \nprogress, and output of their research. A total of 32 international consultants and resource \npersons will be engaged for the duration of the TA for the purpose of generating scholarly \narticles for the ADR. Each consultant will be engaged on a lump-sum basis for 6 months, and is \nexpected to adhere to the submission schedule for drafts and final submissions.6 Variable rates \nof lump-sum compensation, based on the track record of scholarly publications and prevailing \nmarket rates for this type of engagement will be offered to researchers and resource persons.   \n \n21.  A national consultant will be engaged for 20 months to act as copy editor and provide \nsupport  in  coordinating  with  ADR\u2019s  editorial  board.  In  addition,  short-term  administrative \nassistants will be hired as needed. \n \n22.  All international and national consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The national \nconsultant  will  be  based  at  ADB  headquarters  in  Manila.  The  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n23.  Disbursement  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n24.    The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Asian Development Review 2012\u22122013, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n                                                \n6 Please refer to page 9 of ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \n \n ", "6  Appendix 3 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \n       \nImpact  Assumptions \n \nIncreased recognition  Increased number of  Thomson Reuters, if  Availability of experts in \nof ADB as a  journal citations and  SSCI listed  the topics for research \nknowledge center  increasing impact factor     \n      Acquisition of relevant \n      feedback from \n    conference participants \n      \n    Risks \n \n   \nUnavailability or lack of \ninterest among known \nexperts in the specific \nareas of research \n \nMismatch in the \nexpertise of researchers \nand resource persons \n \n       \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nWider dissemination  Increased demand for the  Number of downloads  Increased awareness of \nand readership of the   electronic format of the    the revamped ADR \nADR after the first  ADR by at least 15% each     \nyear of the TA  year for 2012 and 2013, as    Article submissions \n  evidenced by number of    meet the minimum \n  views and downloads    standards used by \n      SSCI-listed journals \nMeeting the minimum  Increase in the number of  Number of subscriptions   \nrequirements for  subscriptions to the ADR     Risks \nquality of articles,  by at least 10% each year   \nleading to an SSCI  for 2012 and 2013  Inadequate promotions \nlisting by Dec 2013    and distribution \n    channels to support the \n  objective of raising the \nprofile of the ADR \n \nBulk of the article \nsubmission fail to meet \nminimum standards \nused for top-tier \nrefereed journals \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 1  7 \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutputs       Assumptions \n       \n1.
