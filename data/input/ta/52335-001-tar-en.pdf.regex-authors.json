THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will help the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Southeast Asia developing member countries (DMCs) in designing programs and projects \nin human and social development (HSD), including piloting innovations, and furthering institutional \nand policy reform. The initial focus will be on programs and projects included in the country \noperations business plans up to 2021 and assistance for ongoing project implementation.1 The \nTA facility will also support demand-driven policy and technical advisory services, capacity \nbuilding, and knowledge sharing. The list of programs and projects supported is in Appendix 2. \n \n2.  Delivering solutions aligned with Strategy 2030. The TA facility will support HSD \npriority projects of Southeast Asia DMCs and address critical common challenges across the \nregion. It is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 20302 and the key thrusts of operational priorities 1 \n(addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities) and 2 (accelerating progress in gender \nequality): generating quality jobs, strengthening human capital, achieving better health for all, and \nensuring social protection for those in need. Cross-sectoral synergies and thematic concerns will \nbe incorporated into the design of all projects, so that integrated solutions are offered to DMCs. \nThe TA facility will foster gender mainstreaming, regional cooperation and integration, climate \nchange risk mitigation and adaptation, innovative financing modalities, technological solutions, \nand private sector engagement across HSD operations. It will help mobilize financial resources \nincluding co-financing and promote knowledge partnerships. The TA facility will enable ADB to \nrespond to demand for project preparatory activities in a timely and effective manner, provide \noversight support, and address emerging capacity gaps for project implementation. By reducing \nthe number of stand-alone TA projects and taking advantage of similar due diligence and \nconsulting service requirements across projects, the TA facility will enhance efficiency in project \npreparation, improve readiness, and expedite implementation.3 Synergy with other TAs in the \nSoutheast Asia Department and ADB departments will be ensured to address HSD priorities in a \nholistic manner, minimizing duplication.  \n \n3.  Generating quality jobs. Ensuring equitable access to decent and productive jobs is \ncritical for reducing inequalities and bringing prosperity. Rapid globalization, disruptive advances \nin technology, urbanization, and increased longevity are dramatically changing the nature of the \njobs, forms of employment, and skills requirements. Improving the business environment for small \nand medium businesses, developing entrepreneurship skills, and strengthening the financial \nsector are essential for creating quality jobs in both urban and rural areas. Preparing the youth \nworkers for non-routine, technology-driven job tasks will require transformative education and \ntraining institutions and enterprises. Providing lifelong learning, new job opportunities for all, \nincluding the elderly, and strengthening social protection by improving labor market programs, will \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017.

The TA facility will support a multisectoral approach, \nespecially on livable cities and health human resource development and aging. \n \n4.  Human capital and social inclusion in Southeast Asia. The Southeast Asian region \nhas experienced impressive HSD progress in recent decades\u2014people live longer, more children \nare in school, and more people have access to employment opportunities and basic social \nservices. The Human Capital Index (HCI),4 quantifies this progress by showing the contribution of \nhealth and education to the productivity of the next generation of workers. While the worldwide \naverage HCI is 0.57, most Southeast Asian countries rank below this (Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic [Lao PDR] 0.45, Myanmar 0.4, Cambodia 0.49, Indonesia 0.53, and Philippines 0.55). \nThailand  and  Viet  Nam  score  0.6  and  0.67  respectively.  With  longer  life  expectancy  and \ndecreasing fertility, Southeast Asian countries are aging rapidly.5 While youthful populations offer \npotential demographic dividend, this relies on quality jobs and maximizing productivity of the \nworking population. Further, income inequality remains challenging particularly in Indonesia, \nPhilippines, Viet Nam, and Lao PDR.6 Disparities by gender also remain significant; according to \nthe gender inequality index,7 Cambodia and Lao PDR rank 112 and 106, respectively, of 188 \ncountries. Paras. 5\u20137 describe gaps in key sectors.  \n \n5.  Education and skills gaps. Increasing competition in regional and global markets and \nthe shift towards a knowledge- and technology-based economy call for significant reform and \nmodernization of education and technical and vocational education and training (TVET) systems. \nMany Southeast Asian governments have launched \u201cindustry 4.0\u201d policies to facilitate the growth \nof industries using new technologies. In parallel, education and TVET systems need to respond \nto the changing skills mix and competencies demanded by industry.8 As emphasized under \nStrategy 2030, ADB will assist DMCs in using technology solutions to improve the quality and \ndelivery of education and skills development. It will help to strengthen students\u2019 foundational skills, \nincluding digital literacy and soft skills, and familiarize them with emerging technologies. The focus \non science, technology, engineering, and mathematics will be enhanced, especially for female \nstudents. ADB will promote stronger links with industry and support lifelong learning and re-skilling \nprograms to ensure that mid-career and older workers can stay productively engaged. It will \nsupport DMCs in developing and operationalizing skills development plans and systems that meet \nthe dynamic pace of change in industry needs at local, national, and regional levels. \n \n5.  Health gaps. Southeast Asian DMCs face several challenges as they try to move towards \nuniversal health coverage.9 On the demand side, many governments are now implementing \nhealth insurance schemes to improve affordability and predictability of health care expenditure. \nHowever, the range of benefits remains insufficient to respond to changes in demographic and \ndisease profiles, including increasing numbers of non-communicable diseases and lifestyle-\n                                                \n4  The HCI consists of the knowledge, skills, experience and health that people accumulate throughout their lives and \nrepresents productivity relative to a benchmark of complete education and full health on a scale of 0 to 1.

Support to the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations Economic Community. \n9  Access to good quality and affordable health care. \n \n ", "3 \nrelated illnesses. On the supply side, many DMCs suffer from poor quality health care services \ndue to outdated infrastructure and equipment, and inadequately trained human resources.10 \nWeak standards for medical education, licensing, management, and systematic deployment of \nhealth  professionals  presents  challenges  for  providing  good  quality,  affordable  health  care \nincluding long-term care for the elderly. In the Greater Mekong Subregion, countries have made \nsignificant progress in improving information exchange on communicable diseases and regularly \ncollaborate to solve regional issues jointly.11 However, gaps remain. These include more effective \nreferral systems, and harmonized policies and regulations governing different health systems. \nFurther, portability of health insurance for vulnerable populations such as migrants will be \nimportant as the region becomes increasingly connected. Countries also need support to carry \nout health impact assessments especially in special economic zones and strengthen health \ninformation networks.12 Demand and supply side interventions require policies which harness \ntechnological  solutions,  empower  communities,  and  encourage  social  entrepreneurship. \nExamples of this include training of community health workers using e-training, telemedicine, and \nelectronic medical records. Supporting the growth of technologies to support \u2018aging in place\u2019 \npresent exciting opportunities for engagement.13 Green solutions for health infrastructure and \nclimate change mitigation measures to promote livable cities will be prioritized.14 \n \n6.  Social protection gaps. The 2013 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \nDeclaration on Strengthening Social Protection recognizes that integrated and functioning social \nprotection systems are fundamental to reducing poverty and inequality, and promoting inclusive \ngrowth. Between 2009 and 2015, for the Asia region, social protection expenditure on each target \nbeneficiary as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita increased from 3.4% to 4.2% \nof GDP per capita. Social protection and social assistance coverage also improved in many \nSoutheast  Asian  countries  including Thailand, Cambodia,  and  Philippines,  primarily  due  to \nprogress in old-age protection through noncontributory social pensions and welfare assistance.15 \nDespite these achievements, more effort is needed to expand coverage and level of protection \nthrough new social assistance, social insurance, and labor market programs.16 This is particularly \nimportant because of the growing challenges posed by climate change, potential job losses owing \nto rapid technological advancement, the growing number of independent workers, and structural \nincome inequality. Attention needs to be given to the most vulnerable populations (youth, elderly, \nwomen, and disabled) living in remote areas to address the needs of an aging population in an \ninter-generational, cross-sectoral, and inclusive manner. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n7.  Output 1: Human and social development projects prepared. Output 1 will provide \ntechnical support to all Southeast Asian DMCs to prepare HSD investment projects and programs. \nThis will include necessary due diligence covering technical, fiduciary, safeguards, social, and \ninstitutional dimensions; economic and financial analysis; and measures to strengthen project \n                                                \n10 ADB is supporting Lao PDR to improve health care quality through complementary TAs.

Specific  activities  include: (i) feasibility  studies; (ii) \neconomic analysis; (iii) financial management assessment, financial evaluation and analysis; (iv) \nprocurement assessment; (v) gender action plans; (vi) risk assessment and management plans; \n(vii) safeguards documents on environment, involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples; \n(viii) sector assessments and country diagnostics; and (ix) poverty and social analysis. Where \nhigh-level and green technology is planned, the feasibility of such technology will be assessed. \n \n8.  Output  2:  Demand-driven  policy  advice  and  capacity  building  for  project \nimplementation supported. The TA facility will provide policy advice and support institutional \nreforms  and  capacity  building  to  ensure  sustainable  project  implementation.  It  will  support \nresearch and build monitoring and evaluation capacity for evidence-based policymaking in areas \nincluding public health, education and TVET policy, labor market assessments, public-private \npartnerships, TVET regional partnership development, accreditation systems, social protection, \nentrepreneurship,  and  marketization  of  innovations.  Capacity  building  activities  including \nstrengthening collaboration arrangements between government staff and national or regional \ninstitutions and industry will be supported. The TA facility will also assist DMCs to explore future \ninvestment opportunities. \n \n9.  Output 3: Knowledge development among countries in the Southeast Asian region \npromoted. Recognizing the value of knowledge sharing beyond Southeast Asian DMCs, the TA \nfacility will support knowledge exchange to align systems and procedures with ASEAN standards, \nand support project development of proposed loans and administration of approved loans. \nBuilding upon ongoing initiatives like accreditation and mutual recognition, applied research, cross \nborder information exchange, analysis on required skills and training towards industry 4.0 will be \nprioritized. Knowledge sharing and dissemination activities will be encouraged through trainings, \nworkshops, and national and regional conferences between DMCs and across ADB thematic \ngroups. All publications and knowledge products will be disseminated electronically by default. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $3,000,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($2,000,000 from TASF-6 and $1,000,000 from TASF-\nother sources). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. The TA facility may be \nreplenished as funds are required or cofinancing from trust funds become available. \n \n11.  The DMC governments will provide support in the form of counterpart staff, office space \nand supplies, secretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions. Governments were informed \nthat TA facility approval does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB will be the executing agency. The Human and Social Development Division of the \nSoutheast Asia Department will administer the TA facility. Activities under Output 1 will commence \nafter ADB concept paper  approval of the ensuing projects. Output 2 and 3 activities may \ncommence upon TA facility approval.  In-country activities will start after obtaining no-objection \nfrom DMC governments. \n \n13.  ADB  will  be  responsible  for  consultant  recruitment  in  consultation  with  participating \ngovernments.17 Concurrence  will  be  sought  from  participating  governments  for  shortlisting \n                                                \n17 Output-based/lump sum contracts will be considered for consulting services where applicable and relevant. \n ", "5 \nconsultants.
