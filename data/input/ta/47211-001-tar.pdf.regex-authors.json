The technical assistance (TA) will provide support during the initial 2-year phase of the \nPartnership for Innovation in Education in Asia and the Pacific, which the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) is pursuing in collaboration with a range of interested partners.1 The partnership will \nbe primarily a knowledge partnership for leveraging know-how and resources for innovation in \neducation  that  will  help  transform  education  services  and  improve  education  outcomes  in \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) in line with their future human resource needs. These \nefforts  also  support  the  implementation  of  ADB\u2019s  education  sector  operations  plan,  which \nemphasizes  the  importance  of  pursuing  new  approaches  and  innovation  in  education \ndevelopment.2 ADB\u2019s role in leading the partnership also very much reflects the spirit and \nobjectives of ADB\u2019s Knowledge Management Directions and Action Plan, 2013\u20132015.3 The \ndesign and monitoring framework of the TA is in Appendix 1.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  While DMCs have increased domestic financing for education, heightened spending has \nnot effectively translated into better education outcomes. In addition, persistent inequality in \naccess to education services is contributing to income inequality and widening disparities in the \nregion.  High  dropout  rates  and  low  completion  rates  in  education  further  exacerbate  the \nsituation in many DMCs. Inefficiency of education has become more visible as many DMCs \nmove toward middle-income status. Increasingly, stakeholders in the region raise concerns \nabout the failure of education to meet the growing demand for appropriately skilled human \nresources so essential to greater productivity, higher economic growth, and regional integration. \n \n3.  It is important to improve equitable access to education and make it more inclusive at all \nlevels, including in secondary and higher education, and skills development services, in which \nthe region is experiencing a strong demand. Efforts must also be intensified to boost the quality \nand labor market relevance of education. However, incremental development strategies do not \neffectively  help  transform  education,  thus  their  impact  on  education  outcomes  is  weak. \nInnovative  education  strategies  and  approaches  are  needed  to  help  transform  education \nservices for impact. This will require in-depth knowledge and understanding of the factors that \nconstrain innovation in education, and action to creatively overcome the constraints. This also \nwill require collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, including the private sector and \nindustry. Investment in the transformation of education is increasingly necessary to enable \neducation to better play its crucial role in developing human resources, which are needed for \nproductive economies and to meet other important development goals.  \n \n4.  The  partnership  will  serve  as  a  catalyst  for  transforming  education,  particularly  by \n(i) identifying and encouraging innovative strategies and operational solutions in education and \n                                                \n1 The partnership approach draws on consultation workshops and meetings of ADB's education community of practice \n(CoP) with several interested development agencies and private sector organizations, including corporate social \nresponsibility  programs  and  foundations.  Demand  for  ADB  support  to  partnership  building  for  innovation  in \neducation is strong and has been consistently expressed by delegates of developing member countries\u2019 education \nministries and institutions, and labor market stakeholders, during ADB-hosted education sector events. Unlike other \ncurrent TA projects supporting collaboration in the sector, the proposed TA has a strong focus on building an \nexpanding partnership model, a regionwide (Asia and the Pacific) scope, and includes direct support to upstream \nwork in ADB operations in the sector.  \n2 ADB. 2010.

Manila. \n4 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 August 2013.  \n ", "2   \nevaluating the scalability of successful models; (ii) creating a strong enabling environment for \ninnovation in education, including through formulation of supportive policies, strategies, and \nplans; and (iii) developing the capacity of stakeholders to collaborate on innovation in education. \n \n5.  The partnership will prepare studies; share knowledge; and promote the design of, and \nexperimentation with, innovative approaches in education in DMCs. It will foster productive \ncollaboration across a wide range of public and private sector stakeholders. Its approach is \ndesigned to be demand-driven and flexible enough to permit expansion and evolution over time \nto accommodate the needs of DMCs at different development stages. In middle-income DMCs \nand  DMCs  approaching  middle-income  status,  innovative  approaches  are  needed  in  skills \ndevelopment and higher education, in particular to respond to the human resource needs of \nsuch DMCs. In low-income DMCs, innovation may focus more on the development of basic and \nsecondary education services as the basis for further education and skills development. \n \n6.  The partnership will include four closely linked platforms. In the initial 2-year phase, \nthese will be established and become operational:  \n \n(i)  Ideas  incubation  markets.  This  process  will  enable  engagement  with  multiple \neducation stakeholders in the region to build consensus on strategic and operational \npriorities  for  transforming  education.  This  will  focus  on  (but  not  be  limited  to)  the \nfollowing broad development areas in which innovation is likely to have a positive, \ntransformative impact on education services in DMCs: \n(a)  Expanding equitable access to education at various levels of education systems \nand  strengthening  inclusive  education.  This  will  require  development  of \ninnovative access and inclusion strategies to enable schools, universities, and \nskills development institutions to better adjust to the needs of the excluded. The \ninclusive education policy and action plan in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic is \nan example of innovative approach in this field. \n(b)  Improving  the  quality  of  education  pedagogy  with  the  help  of  technological \nadvances. This will require greater utilization of latest innovative information and \ncommunication technology (ICT) and social media. The technological advances \nalso will help expand access to education services, including for students from \ndisadvantaged groups and in remote areas in DMCs. South Pacific University \nnetwork is an example of the use of ICT for expanding access across borders.  \n(c)  Strengthening the labor market relevance and sustainable financing of education. \nThis  will  require  innovative  collaboration  strategies,  including  with  private \neducation  providers,  and  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs)  and  other \npartnership  models  for  effective  engagement  with  \u201cnontraditional\u201d  education \ndevelopment partners, including industry and other labor market stakeholders. \nFor example, several DMCs in South Asia are pursuing PPPs to improve and \nexpand basic education delivery through low cost private schools.  \n \n(ii)  Knowledge  generation  and  sharing.  The  partnership  will  make  widely  available \nlessons  on  innovation  in  education  and  skills  development.  The  focus  will  be  on \ninnovative strategies and operational approaches that can make education and skills \ndevelopment services in DMCs more responsive to future human resource needs. This \nwill  also  include  learning  from  successful  innovation  models  in  other  sectors  and \nassessing the feasibility of such models for adoption in the education sector.  \n \n(iii)  Operational  innovation  services.  The  partnership  will  include  the  design, \nimplementation,  and  evaluation  of  innovative  approaches  in  education  in  selected \n ", "  3 \nDMCs. Operational innovation services will help determine the potential impact of these \npilots on transforming education services for better outcomes, the sustainable scalability \nof successful pilots in both technical and financial terms, and the feasibility of their \nadoption in the context of other DMCs.  \n \n(iv)  Capacity development support. This will draw on the knowledge generated in the \npartnership  and  lessons  from  field  pilots.  It  will  help  DMCs  improve  the  enabling \nenvironment for  innovation  and  transformation in  education  by formulating  pertinent \nsector  policies  and  strategies  and  by  developing  the  capacity  of  stakeholders  for \nimplementing innovation in education.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact of the TA will be strengthened contribution of education in human resource \ndevelopment in DMCs. The outcome will be DMCs pursuing transformation of education through \ninnovative pedagogical approaches, technological advances, and other creative solutions. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will provide technical support to an initial 2-year phase of the partnership, during \nwhich partnership operations will be established. The TA will feed lessons from innovation in \neducation to ADB\u2019s operations in the sector, and also help inform the international development \ncommunity in this field. In addition, the TA will help devise an operational model for acceleration \nand expansion of the partnership\u2019s activities beyond the initial phase.  \n \n9.  Output 1: Enabling environment for innovation in education strengthened in DMCs. \nFor this output, the TA will provide technical support for the partnership\u2019s platforms, as follows:  \n \n(i)  The  TA  will  organize  ideas  incubation  market  events  and  enable  consultation  with \nmultiple public and private stakeholders to build consensus on strategic and operational \npriorities for innovation in education in DMCs. The TA will engage interest groups (e.g., \nfor issues in particular subsectors and key thematic areas in education) to boost focused \npeer and stakeholder participation and ensure tangible consultation results. TA team \nmembers will serve as resource persons during the events.  \n \n(ii)  The TA will undertake various knowledge generation and sharing activities. In particular, \nthe TA will (a) review studies undertaken and knowledge available globally on policies, \nstrategies, and operational models that support innovative approaches in education; \n(b) carry out further studies and analytical work in this field,  as necessary in close \ncollaboration with centers of excellence and other specialized institutions, and prepare \nrelated briefs, analytical think pieces, case studies, policy and technical notes, and other \noperationally  relevant  knowledge  products,  focusing  particularly  on  innovation  in \neducation that is pertinent to developing countries in Asia and the Pacific; and (c) share \nthe knowledge through diverse channels, including social media. \n \n(iii)  To support operational innovation services, the TA will develop a method to identify and \nprioritize promising operational models for piloting innovation in education services in \n ", "4   \nselected DMCs.5 For experimentation of the pilots, the TA will help establish operational \npartnerships  between  public  and  private  organizations  and  other  stakeholders,  as \nnecessary. The TA will provide technical support to the operational partnerships and \nassessment of scalability of the pilots.  \n \n(iv)  The  TA  will  organize  regional  and  subregional  capacity  development  events  (and \nnational events in selected DMCs) to bring together leaders and officers from education \nministries and institutions and other important stakeholders. Training will be provided on \nformulation  of  policies,  strategies,  and  models  that  support  innovation  in  education \nservices, and on effective collaboration in their implementation. The TA support also will \nhelp establish professional communities of practice (CoPs) in this field in DMCs and in \nthe region. TA team members will serve as resource persons during the events. \n10.  Output 2: ADB operations strengthened for supporting innovation in education. \nDrawing on the knowledge and lessons generated, the TA will accomplish the following: \n \n(i)  Provide  expert  services  to  ADB\u2019s  education  CoP  and  operations  departments  to \nstrengthen  upstream  work  in  the  education  sector,  with  a  particular  focus  on  new \napproaches and operational strategies that help DMCs pursue innovation in education. \nThis will include support to sector analytical work and preparation of road maps for \ncountry  partnership  strategies  (CPSs),  including  support  to  preparatory  work  for \neducation projects or programs. \n \n(ii)  Prepare practical tools to guide the design and implementation of effective external \nsupport for innovation in education. These will be used as reference material for (a) the \neducation  CoP\u2019s  staff  development  program;  (b)  dialogue  with  DMC  education \nministries, institutions, private sector organizations, and other education stakeholders; \n(c) programming  of  ADB  support  to  education  in  DMCs;  and  (d)  design  of  specific \ninnovative  components  in  ensuing  ADB-financed  education  projects  and  sector \nprograms in DMCs. The tools also will be made available for wider regional and global \ncommunity of education practitioners. \n \n11.  Output 3: Operational model for the partnership\u2019s next phase developed. The TA \nwill provide technical inputs to ADB\u2019s international conference on external support for innovation \nin education. DMC governments, development partners, and a range of public and private \nstakeholder organizations will be invited to contribute to the event. The TA also will assist in in-\ndepth analysis of lessons learned in the initial phase of the partnership. Drawing on outcomes of \nthe conference and the analysis, the TA will provide technical support to the development of an \noperational model that will accelerate and expand the partnership to a comprehensive regional \npartnership facility for innovation in education, in which ADB continues to provide leadership \nand foster concerted action among a range of public and private sector stakeholders.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.7 million equivalent, of which (i) $400,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V); and (ii) $1.3 million will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Government of Finland, and administered by ADB. The cost \nestimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2. \n                                                \n5 The developing member countries will be selected when pilots are prioritized. Concurrence of governments will be \nsought prior to field work. \n ", "  5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  of  the  TA.  A  partnership  committee  will  meet \nsemiannually (physically or virtually) to provide strategic guidance for the partnership and the \nTA, review and approve the implementation plan, and oversee and monitor the execution of the \nplan. The committee will be chaired by the director general of the Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment  Department  (RSDD)  of  ADB,  or  his  or  her  designate,  and  will  comprise \nrepresentatives of external partner organizations, ADB\u2019s education CoP chair and co-chairs, \nand directors of ADB\u2019s social sector divisions. A partnership operations working group, led by \nADB\u2019s  practice  leader  for  education,  and  comprising  ADB  education  CoP  members  and \neducation sector experts from partner organizations, will provide coordination and operational \nguidance for the partnership, including the technical support provided by the TA. The education \nCoP  Secretariat,  located  in  RSDD,  will  provide  logistical  assistance  for  the  partnership \ncommittee and the operations working group.  \n \n14.  Implementation is expected to begin in November 2013 and be completed in October \n2015. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with the Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The partnership will need to \nensure  a  demand-driven  approach  and  evolution  to  effectively  catalyze  transformation  in \neducation. Thus, the TA supporting the partnership will include a pool resource arrangement for \nconsultants to ensure flexibility and operational latitude for the TA to respond adequately to the \nneeds of partnership implementation. Similarly, to ensure responsiveness, TA consultants will \nbe engaged individually in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas amended from time to time). The total requirements are 45 person-months of international \nconsultants and 50 person-months of national consultants.  \n \n15.  Expertise will be needed to support the ideas incubation process and organization of \nconsultative events. Given the strong emphasis on effective knowledge generation and sharing \nin  the  partnership,  the  TA  will  include  research  expertise  to  support  the  design  and \nimplementation of studies on new strategies and approaches in education; and production of \nrelated knowledge  products  in  user-friendly formats,  including  dissemination  through  social \nmedia. Operational expertise will be needed to guide the design of innovative pilots in education \nin DMCs. Evaluation expertise will be needed to help assess the transformative impact of the \npilots, and their sustainable scalability in technical and financial terms. The TA team also will \ninclude experts in education sector planning to assist DMCs in transforming education services \nthrough formulation of appropriate policies and strategies, and to help strengthen collaboration \ncapacity for implementation of innovation and new approaches in education. Outline terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n16.  To ensure synergy and complementarity, it will be important to closely coordinate the TA \nsupport with possible contributions (i.e., non-TA contributions: expertise resources and financing) \nfrom partner organizations that will participate in the partnership\u2019s initial phase. Therefore, the \nTA will assist ADB in coordinating contributions from such partners.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,300,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Finland; and (ii) ADB providing the balance not \nexceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis, for the Partnership for Innovation in \nEducation in Asia and the Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact  Assumption \n   \nContribution of  Education services are more  Data from education  DMCs value the \neducation to  responsive and education  ministries and  importance of \nhuman resource  outcomes are better,  institutions  innovation for \ndevelopment  corresponding to the human  transformation in \nstrengthened in  resource development needs in  Tracer studies of  education, and \nDMCs  DMCs  graduates  support these \nefforts with \nLabor market reports  appropriate policies \nand adequate \n \nfinancial and other \nnecessary \nresources \nOutcome  Risk \n   \nDMCs pursue  Education sector policies,  Documents and plans of  Bureaucratic \ntransformation of  strategies, and implementation  education ministries and  impediments in the \neducation  plans in DMCs reflect increasing  institutions  education sector in \nthrough  efforts to implement innovation in    DMCs hamper \ninnovative  education to improve the quality  TA progress reports and  efforts to pursue \npedagogical  and labor market relevance of  monitoring reports  innovation in \napproaches,  education, strengthen  education in an \ntechnological  inclusiveness of education  effective and \nadvances, and  systems, and improve cost- sustainable manner \nother creative  efficiency and sustainable \nsolutions  financing of education services \nOutputs  Assumption \n   \n1.
