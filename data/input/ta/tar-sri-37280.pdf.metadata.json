A technical assistance cluster (TAC), Financial \nSector Development and Product Innovation, was included in the CSP. The TAC included \ncofinancing for $1.2 million, of which $700,000 would be provided in 2004, and $500,000 in \n2005. ADB will provide $500,000 for the TAC in 2004.  \n \n2.  The  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency  (Sida)  will  provide \ncofinancing1 for the TAC. A  Fact-Finding Mission with Sida participation was fielded on 26\u201330 \nApril 2004. The Government of Sri Lanka, ADB, and Sida agreed on the TAC\u2019s objectives and \nthat the TAC should focus on implementing products and services for the domestic debt market. \nAn ADB follow-up Mission visited Sri Lanka on 19-21 May to confirm with the Government and \nstakeholders the TAC\u2019s components and structure. The TAC2 framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n3.  The  Government  has  made  significant  strides  in  the  overall  framework  supporting \nsystemic development of the financial sector. Various donor organizations have helped draft \nlaws and regulations for an effective regulatory framework. However, there is an urgent need to: \n(i) deepen the implementation of the financial reforms included in the policy and regulatory \nframework; and (ii) adapt relevant financial products and services necessary to adequately \nsupport the development of a stronger and more competitive financial (i.e., banking and capital) \nmarket that will enhance economic growth, create jobs, and reduce poverty.  \n \n4.  The TAC will complement (i) Sida\u2019s ongoing technical assistance (TA) in collaboration \nwith Riksbanken (Central Bank of Sweden) to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka; (ii) ADB\u2019s Private \nSector Development Program approved in 2000,3 Private Sector Development (Subprogram II),4 \nand the Small and Medium Enterprise Sector Development Program5 approved in 2001; (iii) \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  financial  recommendations;6  and  (iv)  the  World  Bank\u2019s \nongoing work in restructuring contractual savings institutions, including pension and provident \nfunds.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n5.  Limited access to financing, particularly long-term financing for infrastructure, and the \nhigh cost of funds in the country hinder increased private sector activity. Much progress has \nbeen made, particularly with regard to the Government's fiscal consolidation of the historically \nlarge deficits, primarily financed through the short-term domestic debt market. Additionally, \nauctions of treasury bills and bonds in recent years have proved a better basis for Government \nborrowings and have improved the activity of the long-term debt market, but further progress still \nneeds to be made. Moreover, there are a limited number of corporate bonds presently issued. \n                                                 \n1  Sida has committed to provide cofinancing in the amount of SEK9,500,000. Based upon the exchange rate as of 25 \nAugust 2004 of $1.00 = SEK7.57, Sida's (maximum) total commitment is approximately $1,255,000.  \n2  The TAC first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 11 May 2004. \n3  ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for Private Sector Development Program. Manila.  \n4 TA 4248-SRI: Project preparatory work is ongoing for the $65-million private sector development program \n(subprogram II) scheduled for ADB Board consideration by December 2004. Regulatory and policy reforms in the \ncapital market, including the debt market, will be included in the program. \n5  ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for Small and Medium Enterprise Sector Development Program. Manila.  \n6  IMF Country Report No. 04/68.  ", "2  \nPublicly traded bonds with an extended yield curve (i.e., 15\u201320 years) should also be made \navailable in the capital market. \n \n6.  The financial system continues to be dominated by the banking sector and state-owned \ninstitutions. The latter has a large presence in banking, insurance, and provident funds; controls \nover 60% of the total assets of financial institutions; and utilizes over 50% of the country\u2019s \nfinancial resources. Assets of institutional investors amount to approximately one third of the \ntotal assets of banks. Despite their large size, their impact on financial market development and \nproducts and services offered have been negligible, mainly because they have been used as a \ncaptive source of funding Government debt, which has primarily issued short-term paper.  \n \n7.  As  a  result  of  limited  long-term  financing  products  available  in  the  debt  market, \ninsurance companies face significant risks in managing their portfolios and are unable to match \nthe maturities of their investment with the liabilities in the portfolio (e.g., investments, on \naverage,  have  maturities  of  3-5  years  while  liabilities  have  maturities  of  20\u201330  years). \nAdditionally, mortgage companies have difficulty raising long-term financing, resulting in limited \nfinancing for home mortgages. The mortgage financing that is available is too expensive.  \n \n8.  Sri Lanka has few long-term savings institutions and institutional investors. Long-term \nsavings are primarily held in State-operated Employee Provident Funds and the State-owned \nNational Savings Bank. These institutions could reduce their portfolio risks and improve their \ninvestment yields if proper asset management techniques were employed. There is a need to \nstrengthen the network of financial intermediaries and financial institutions in the debt market.  \n \n9.  The absence of a well-functioning financial market has led to insufficient risk pooling and \nrisk sharing, thereby limiting the scope for high-risk/high-return projects necessary to increase \neconomic growth. The number of products and services offered is limited, especially to manage \ninvestment risk for issuers and investors. If investor confidence and knowledge improved, \ninterest rate spreads would narrow. \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.   Purpose and Output \n \n10.  The TAC\u2019s purpose is  to further strengthen the domestic debt market (and, thus, the \nfinancial system) on the basis of identified needs, as outlined in the previous section. The TAC \nwill  support  implementation  of  some  of  the  necessary  financial  reforms  for  long-term \nsustainability by providing awareness campaigns, capacity building, and on-site training through \n\u201clearning by doing\u201d from international institutions. Priority for improving skill development will be \ngiven to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the Public Debt Department. \n \n11.  The expected results and deliverables of the TAC include (i) introduction of relevant \nproducts and services for the debt market that should attract more domestic and international \ninvestment capital to Sri Lanka; (ii) stimulation of economic growth by providing additional \nfinancial products and services; (iii) reduction of overall capital cost and financial risk to the \nGovernment and private sector; (iv) improvement and strengthening of financial institutions; (v) \ndiversification of investment opportunities for asset managers, pension funds, and insurance \ncompanies; (vi) improvement of liquidity, market efficiency, and transparency in the capital \nmarket;  (vii)  provision  of  alternative  savings  products;  and  (viii)  improvement  of  the \nmanagement and financial performance of pension and provident funds.  \n ", "  3\n \n12.  As  a  collaborative  effort,  the  TAC  will  be  implemented  in  close  consultation  with \nstakeholders. IMF, World Bank, Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and United \nStates Agency for International Development (USAID) support an enabling environment for \nbusiness development. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.   The TAC has six components: \n  \n1.  Component 1: Asset and Risk Management \n \n14.  The TAC will provide support to the bond market in the areas of (i) credit, (ii) interest \nrate, and (iii) currency risk management. The TAC will also provide skill development for asset \nmanagers to understand and better manage financial risks in investment portfolios. The TAC will \nexpose issuers and investors to alternative hedging and debt-financing products. \n \n2.  Component 2: Publicly Traded Securitized Bonds \n \n15.  Appropriate awareness campaigns and capacity building will be provided to introduce \npublicly traded securitized bonds, which will improve liquidity in the debt market; improve the \nbalance sheets of financial institutions; provide less expensive sources for funding; develop a \nlonger term yield curve in the bond market; and provide critically needed financing alternatives \nto various industries, particularly the home mortgage market.  \n \n3.  Component 3: Bond Derivatives \n \n16.  Awareness campaigns will be conducted on the use of derivatives, in general, and bond \nderivatives, in particular, with the goal of developing a bond derivatives market7 in Sri Lanka. \nCapacity building for users, investors, regulators, and other pertinent stakeholders will be \nconducted. Bond derivatives should help portfolio managers reduce risks associated with asset \nand liability management, as well as improve the rates of returns on ni vestment portfolios, \nthereby stimulating savings and development of additional savings products.  \n \n4.  Component 4: Infrastructure Bonds with Credit Insurance Guarantee  \n \n17.  The feasibility of providing a credit insurance guarantee for issuance of long-term (e.g., \n10\u201315 years) Sri Lankan rupee-denominated bonds to be listed on the domestic bond market to \nfinance a pilot infrastructure project will be assessed. The credit insurance guarantee would \nguarantee timely payments of principal and interest on the bond, and through the guarantee, the \nbond would be \u201cAAA\u201d rated, thus eliminating the need for a Government guarantee. The TAC \nwill identify potential donor organizations to provide a credit insurance guarantee8 in local \ncurrency. Funding in domestic currency could facilitate the financing of certain infrastructure \nprojects that are not possible or appropriate to finance through dollar financing (i.e., avoiding \ncurrency mismatch by matching a project's costs, including debt service, with the project\u2019s \nrevenue flows). By providing funds in local currency, local institutions (e.g., banks) could also \n                                                 \n7 The repurchase agreement (REPO) market in Sri Lanka is very active. As a result, bond derivatives will be the first \nderivative product to be introduced into the capital market. \n8  ADB; Sida; and/or GuarantCo, a group of bilateral donors within the Private Infrastructure Development Group \n(including the development aid authorities of the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom). \n ", "4  \nprovide additional credit for the project. The availability of long-term instruments, if openly \ntraded, should further develop the local debt market. The choice of the pilot case would depend \nupon, among other things, (i) the project\u2019s probability of success, (ii) size of the issue, and (iii) \npotential demand for the investment. MOF staff will be assigned to work on the pilot project with \nthe consultants, thereby enhancing financial skills within the MOF.  \n \n5.  Component 5: Capacity Building for the Public Debt Department  \n \n18.  Capacity building will be provided to the Public Debt Department in debt management, \nrisk analysis, and methods of adapting an efficient publicly traded Government bond market. \n \n6.  Component 6: Capacity Building in the Debt Market for the Ministry of \n  Finance \n \n19.  The TAC will provide capacity building in the capital market, including the commercial \ndebt  market,  for  MOF  staff.  In  order  to  further develop the skills needed at the External \nResources and the Development Finance departments within the MOF, specific courses will be \ndeveloped for each of the departments. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n20.  The TAC\u2019s total cost is estimated at $2,040,000 equivalent, comprising $1,253,400 in \nforeign exchange, and $786,600 equivalent in local currency costs. Sida will provide cofinancing \nof $1,200,000 (footnote 1), of which $700,000 will be funded in 2004, and the remaining \n$500,000 in 2005. The ADB portion of the TAC will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. ADB will provide $500,000 in 2004, of which $368,647 will cover the foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $131,353  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  will \ncontribute $340,000 equivalent to fund counterpart staff, office facilities, and administrative \nservices.  ADB  will  administer  the  TAC,  including  cofinancing  provided  by  Sida.  The  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  MOF will be  the TAC\u2019s Executing Agency, as well as the Implementing Agency for \nComponent 6. The Implementing Agency for Components 1\u20135 will be the Central Bank of Sri \nLanka. MOF will appoint a qualified professional to manage the TAC. It will be implemented \nover 16 months, from December 2004 to March 2006. A team of eight international and four \ndomestic consultants will provide 42 person-months of consulting services. An international \nconsulting firm will provide a full technical proposal and will be recruited for Components 1\u20134 \nand Component 6 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  The  quality-based \nselection method will be used to select consultants because of the complexity of the TAC, which \ncovers a number of subsectors, public and private debt markets, public and private institutional \ninvestors, retail investors, financial intermediaries, and capital market infrastructure. The issues \nare highly sensitive and will require high-level interaction with Government officials, Government \nagencies, regulators, and stakeholders. The consultants must have a high level of credibility and \ncompetence. Due to its knowledge and success in managing and issuing public debt, and prior \nexperience in working on similar projects with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the National Debt \nOffice of Sweden, a Swedish Government agency, will be chosen by direct selection to provide \nconsultancy services for Component 5. The agency will complement the ongoing work of \nRiksbanken with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. A \n ", "  5\nnumber of activities will start simultaneously, and the sequencing in each sector will be carried \nout separately. An implementation schedule is provided in Appendix 4. The terms of reference \nfor consultants and the implementation schedule are subject to change, depending on the \noutput and/or recommendations of the other TAC components.  \n \n22.  In support of the TA activities, the Executing and Implementing Agencies will provide (i) \nfurnished office space for the consultants and access to a conference room, (ii) secretarial \nsupport, and (iii) local communication facilities for the consultants in Colombo. Staff from the \nImplementing Agencies will be made available on a part-time basis. \n \n23.  An inception report (with detailed work and implementation plans) will be submitted for \neach component by the consultants to the Executing, the respective Implementing Agencies, \nADB, and Sida within 2 weeks from the start of work, an interim report halfway through the \nengagement, and a draft final report 2 weeks before the end of the engagement. The draft \ninterim and final reports will be discussed at tripartite meetings involving the Executing, the \nrespective Implementing Agencies, consultants, ADB, and Sida. The interim and final reports \nwill incorporate results from the meetings and be made available 2 weeks from the date of the \nmeetings.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n \n24.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,200,000 to the Government of Sri Lanka \nfor Implementing Products and Services for the Domestic Debt Market, to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Government of Sweden. If the Board approves ADB administering the \ntechnical assistance, the President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, will \napprove ADB providing the balance of the technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of \n$500,000, for Implementing Products and Services for the Domestic Debt Market, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n ", "6 Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring   Assumptions \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoals       \n1.
