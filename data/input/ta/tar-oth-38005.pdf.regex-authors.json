The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has conducted an annual orientation program for the \ngovernment officials of its developing member countries (DMCs) since 1989, except in 1996.1 The \nprogram has provided the participants with carefully designed in-house training involving (i) exposure \nto ADB\u2019s policies, procedures, and operations; (ii) introduction to selected aspects of development \nplanning; (iii) discussion of project management skills; and (iv) awareness of ADB\u2019s changing role. \nThe  participants  were  generally  midlevel  government  officials  with  experience  in  managing \ndevelopment work. This technical assistance (TA) will meet the costs of continuing the program for \nthe 3 years from 2004 to 2006.2 The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The program provides an opportunity for participants to enhance their familiarity with ADB \npolicies and procedures, and ADB\u2019s activities in their countries. Furthermore, it aims to help the \nparticipants upgrade their skills, particularly in development planning, and managing development \nactivities in their countries. The program also promotes networking opportunities and good will \nbetween ADB and participating DMCs. From ADB\u2019s perspective, the program serves as an important \npublic  relations  opportunity  to  enhance  ADB\u2019s  visibility  and  development  impact  within  the \nparticipating DMCs.  A total of 291 participants from 35 DMCs have benefited from the Program \n(Appendix 2 presents the distribution of participants by year and country). \n \n3.  Other ADB programs are available for officials of DMCs and staff of executing agencies, to \nimpart skills in specific areas like economic assessment, project management, and procurement. \nThe scope, coverage, and duration of such programs are different from that of the program proposed \nin this report. \n \n4.  Since 1997, Participants in the program have been surveyed regarding the program\u2019s merits. \nThey noted that the concept is fundamentally sound, and they returned to their countries with a \nbetter understanding of ADB\u2019s operations and policies. They also interacted closely with ADB staff \nwho  are  working  with  their  countries.  A  parallel  and  useful  outcome  of  the  program  is  that \nparticipants learned about other countries and cultures; an experience that is of value particularly to \nparticipants engaged in regional economic cooperation activities.  Since 2003, an alumni scheme \nhas been established to keep the program participants of previous years updated on major changes \nand developments in ADB\u2019s policies, procedures, and operations.  \n \n5.  The  survey  of  previous  participants  also  suggested  some  areas  for  improvement.  To \nmaximize the understanding of the participants, the presentations will be more interactive (e.g., \nbreak-out group discussions) and more opportunities will be available for the participants to meet \nwith ADB staff. To assure that the program is tailored to the needs of the participants, the needs is \nthe  participants  assessed  1  month  in  advance  of  the  program  each  year  and  the  program  is \ndesigned incorporating such identified needs as appropriate.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 The title Orientation Program replaced the title Special Secondment Scheme, which was used from 1990 to 1995. \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 9 January 2004. ", "2 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n6.  The objectives of the 2004\u20132006 program are to \n \n(i)  increase  familiarity  of  counterpart  officials  with  ADB\u2019s  policies,  procedures,  and \noperations; \n \n(ii)  improve participants\u2019 knowledge of planning, managing, monitoring, and evaluating \ndevelopment activities; \n \n(iii)  enhance the relationship between ADB and the DMC counterpart agencies; and \n \n(iv)  enhance the DMCs\u2019 understanding of ADB\u2019s changing role. \n \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The  program,  which  will  be  held  annually  over  the  3  years  2004\u20132006,  will  support \napproximately 35 participants each year from selected DMCs for 2.5 weeks at ADB headquarters. \nParticipants will be from organizations in DMCs that borrow from ADB and/or are counterparts to \nADB in implementing ADB-financed projects and programs. Each of the selected DMCs will be \ninvited to send one official for the program. The nominees should be government officials at the level \nof director or deputy director of a division (or equivalent), preferably from planning agencies, the \nministry of finance, the ministry of economic affairs, or other central ministries associated with ADB \noperations in the DMC concerned. All participants must have a working knowledge of English. ADB\u2019s \nresident  missions  and/or  counterpart  agencies  in  DMCs  may  recommend  suitable  government \nand/or ministry officials as participants for the program. \n \n8.  Based on the success of the previous programs and the lessons learned from them, the \ncurrent program will have a variety of learning opportunities taking into consideration the needs of \nthe participants and the accommodative capacity of the ADB departments and offices. Aside from \nthe participants\u2019 surveys, other measures to evaluate achievement of the program\u2019s objectives will \ninclude surveys of and views from resident mission staff 6 months after the training and a follow-up \nsurvey  and/or  questionnaire  to  the  participant\u2019s  supervisor  to  ascertain  the  change  in  the \nparticipant\u2019s performance.  \n \n9.  Briefing sessions of the program will include (i) introduction to ADB\u2019s strategies, policies, and \nprocedures; (ii) ADB\u2019s loan products and project processing operations; (iii) procurement operations; \n(iv) consulting services; (v) disbursement operations; (vi) economic and financial analysis of projects; \n(vii) project performance monitoring and lessons learned from post evaluation of projects; and (viii) \nvisits to an international organization and ADB project sites. ADB\u2019s accountability mechanism and \nanticorruption policy will also be adequately covered in the program. Another important topic will be \nADB\u2019s role in subregional and regional cooperation among DMCs. In this regard, it is important to \nshow how ADB is changing its own profile of lending instruments and focus on knowledge transfer in \nprojects and TAs. \n \n \n ", "    3 \n10.  The sessions will include several case studies dealing with such issues as procurement, \nconsultant selection, and disbursement, and will be based on ADB\u2019s day-to-day experiences. The \nStrategy and Policy Department and the Regional and Sustainable Development Department will be \nclosely consulted in defining the program content.  \n \n11.  In addition to the regular sessions, the participants can visit counterpart divisions to discuss \nproject-related or other issues of interest to deepen their understanding of ADB\u2019s operations. The \nHuman Resources Division (BPHR) will arrange the meetings in cooperation with the divisions \nconcerned. \n \n12.  To increase the learning impact, the participants will be encouraged to become involved in \nthe program before it starts. Issues of interest in ADB\u2019s operations and the expectations of the \nparticipants  will  be  incorporated  into  the  course  content,  design,  and  delivery.  Operations \ndepartments  are  expected  to  provide  information  about  the  latest  policy  developments  to \nparticipants.  This will allow the participants to prepare for sessions that are more interactive than in \nthe past.  \n \n13.  During  the  program,  ADB  will  organize  study  tours  so  that  participants  can  visit  other \ninternational organizations operating in the Philippines, such as the International Rice Research \nInstitute, and ADB-financed projects being implemented in the Philippines. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $725,000 (Appendix 3). The TA will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  and  will  provide  round-trip  airfare  (economy  class), \naccommodation, and per diem for each participant. The participating DMC governments will grant \nleave of absence to their participants in the orientation program and continue to pay their salaries \nduring that period. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.   ADB  is  the  Executing Agency  for  the  TA  and  will  recruit  an  individual  as international \nconsultant for 7 person-weeks for each orientation program. The consultant must be knowledgeable \nabout ADB\u2019s set up, policies, procedures, and operations, and will be responsible for arranging the \nbriefing sessions in coordination with the departments and offices concerned, preparing the case \nstudies, and arranging the details of the participants\u2019 assignments with their counterpart divisions. \nOutline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  attached  as  Appendix  4.  The  international \nconsultant  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants. Secretarial services and logistical arrangements will be provided by an individual locally \nrecruited consultant (seminar assistant) who will be engaged for 15 person-weeks in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s guidelines and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants.  \n \n16.  The Orientation Program will be conducted during October and/or November each year. \nADB,  through  BPHR,  will  administer  the  TA  in  close  consultation  with  concerned  operational \ndepartments and offices within ADB. Participants will be selected by BPHR in close consultation with \nthe  counterpart  divisions  mainly  in  operations  departments.  The  estimated  completion  date  is \nDecember 2006. \n ", "4 \n17.  At the end of each annual program, participants will evaluate the usefulness of the program, \nand the logistical and administrative arrangements. Their feedback will help ADB and resource \nspeakers improve the program to better meet participant\u2019s needs in the following year. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the provision \nof technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $725,000 on a grant basis for the 2004\u20132006 \nOrientation Program for Officials of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Developing Member Countries, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \n \n TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK  \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \n1.
