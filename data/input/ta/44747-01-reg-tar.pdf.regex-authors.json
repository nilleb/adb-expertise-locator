INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Regional  cooperation  in  agriculture  under  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS) \nregional cooperation program is implemented by the GMS working group on agriculture (WGA). \nIn  2007,  the  WGA  conducted  a  regional  study  on  strategic  options  for  biofuel  and  rural \nrenewable energy development in the GMS.1 The study was further developed into a GMS \nstrategic  framework  and  action  plan  for  biofuels  and  rural  renewable  energy,  which  was \nendorsed at the fifth annual meeting of the WGA in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n(Lao PDR) in 2008. To implement the framework, the GMS countries requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to prioritize assistance for bioenergy, including technology transfer \nfrom more advanced countries in the GMS to Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam, to \ndiversify the region\u2019s energy options while ensuring food security. In response, ADB confirmed \nthe regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) for 2011. ADB also confirmed a \nregional project preparatory TA and a regional investment project for Cambodia, the Lao PDR, \nand Viet Nam in the 2012\u20132013 pipeline. The TA concept was first presented and endorsed by \nthe GMS countries at the annual meeting of the WGA in Viet Nam in 2010. A fact-finding \nmission in January\u2013February 2011 further discussed and reached agreement on the concept \npaper.2 The design and monitoring framework for the TA is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Fighting climate change and improving the well-being of the rural poor while promoting \ninclusive economic growth are often seen as competing priorities. Yet these goals can all be \nserved at the same time through the efficient use of biomass by the poor. Biomass resources \nare abundant in the GMS, but their potential to address the energy and food insecurity problems \nof the poor has yet to be tapped. Large numbers of people in the GMS\u201492% of the people in \nthe Lao PDR, 85% in Cambodia, and 56% in Viet Nam\u2014continue to rely on the unsustainable \nharvest of fuelwood for their household energy needs. The resulting deforestation, soil erosion, \nand  loss  of  biodiversity  reduce  environmental  services  and  performance.  Black  carbon \nemissions  from  the burning of biomass in open fields contribute to the formation of large \nregional atmospheric brown clouds3 and are among the three largest contributors to global \nwarming  (the  other  two  are  carbon  dioxide  and  methane).  Black  carbon  emissions  from \nunimproved cookstoves also create indoor air pollution, causing serious respiratory diseases, \nespecially among women and children. Studies show that improved cookstoves are among the \nmost cost-effective measures for mitigating climate change, reducing environmental impact, and \nimproving the health of the poor.  \n3.  Biodiesel from oilseed crops (e.g., jatropha) grown on marginal lands in integrated \nfarming  systems  is  another  source  of  clean  bioenergy  for  the  poor  in  remote  areas. \nControversies related to biofuel development relate mainly to the large-scale production of \nbiofuels, displacing food production areas and forestland. However, intercropping biofuel crops \nin small-scale systems has been shown to improve energy security without compromising food \nsecurity. Moreover, such systems can contribute significantly to agro-ecological stability and \nresilience to climate change. Global energy trends and climate change threats highlight the \nneed for low-carbon, sustainable, and efficient energy systems. A 10% increase in the efficiency \n                                                \n1  The study led to the following reports: (i) Integrating Biofuel and Rural Renewable Energy Production in Agriculture \nfor Poverty Reduction in the GMS: An Overview and Strategic Framework for Biofuel Development (main report); \n(ii) Global and Regional Development and Impact of Biofuels: A Focus on the GMS (modeling report); and (iii) six \nindividual country reports. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 March 2011. \n3  Atmospheric brown clouds have significant effects on regional temperatures, rainfall, agriculture, and health.  \n ", "2   \nof biomass production, through improved farm management and irrigation, can create enough \nenergy to meet the global energy demand.4  \n \n4.  Besides the concerns about energy security, food security in the GMS is increasingly \nthreatened by a deteriorating natural resource base. Over 40% of arable land is degraded, mostly \nbecause of unsustainable agricultural practices and deforestation, and remedies are urgently \nneeded. Current agriculture practices also emit greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide5 and \nmethane. Agricultural wastes6 and forest residues, which cause environmental problems and \npollute waterways when left to decay, can be used to produce bioenergy, biochar,7 and organic \nfertilizers. By-products from bioenergy production  (such as  bio-slurry from bio-digesters) are \nhigh-quality soil amendments. Soils rich in organic matter increase soil fertility, improve water \nquality, lessen soil erosion, and reduce the toxic impact of pesticides, heavy metals, and other \npollutants.  Crops grown on healthy soil are  more tolerant to floods and  drought and more \nnutritious, and therefore promote food security. In addition, organically grown products are in \nincreasingly greater demand and have become a new income-earning opportunity for the poor. \nMost importantly, soils rich in organic matter sequester atmospheric carbon and thus reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions.  \n \n5.  Several biomass technologies are eligible for carbon financing, offering added incentives \nfor  the  poor.  Improved  cookstoves  and  biochar  are  among  the  \u201cfast-action\u201d  strategies8 for \nmitigating  climate  change,  that  have  been  prioritized  by  the  United  Nations  Framework \nConvention on Climate Change. Given the growing demand for sustainably certified products9 in \nthe global market, the support for certifying products produced by the poor will help make their  \nproducts more marketable and increase the income of the poor. The regional sourcing of a critical \nmass of certified products for the export market is currently limited by the lack of common \nstandards and certification systems. With harmonized standards, a regionally inclusive supply \nchain can be developed. \n \n6.  In Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam, the efficient use of biomass has mostly been \npromoted on a small scale by nongovernment organizations (NGOs). SNV (a Dutch NGO) has \nbeen a major player in promoting biogas, working with the national programs in all three \ncountries. Helvetas (a Swiss NGO) has supported certified organic agriculture in the Lao PDR \nand Viet Nam. Private sector firms have established supply chains to collect certified jatropha \nseeds from smallholder farmers. German development cooperation through GIZ has pilot-tested \nan improved cookstove project in Viet Nam and is now implementing a pilot biochar project in \nthe Lao PDR. In Cambodia, GERES (a French NGO) is the world\u2019s first developer of an \nimproved cookstove project to successfully trade on the carbon market. Building on its success, \nGERES is setting up a \u201cstove academy\u201d to train other project developers.  \n \n7.  Expanding investments in biomass technologies to benefit a large number of the poor \nhas been a major challenge\u2014except for investments in biogas technology. ADB\u2019s experience \n                                                \n4  S. Ladanai and J. Vinterb\u00e4ck. 2009. Global Potential of Sustainable Biomass for Energy. Sweden.  \n5  Nitrous oxide (N O) is a potent greenhouse gas with a heat-trapping ability 290 times that of carbon dioxide (CO ). \n2 2\nThe heat-trapping ability of methane is 21 times that of CO . \n2\n6  Residual stalks, straw, leaves, roots, husks, nutshells or seed shells, waste wood, and animal husbandry waste. \n7  Biochar production, which converts carbon in plants into a stable charcoal-like substance by burning biomass in an \noxygen-reduced atmosphere (pyrolysis), has the potential to mitigate 3.67 gigatonnes of CO per year by 2040. \n2 \n8  \u201cFast-action\u201d strategies can be initiated within 2\u20133 years, implemented within 5\u201310 years, and produce the required \nclimate response within decades. \n9  Such as  organic , eco-label, and, biofuel products certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels. \n ", "  3\nwith biogas in the People\u2019s Republic of China has been highly successful.10 Currently, ADB and \nthe World Bank each support a biogas investment project in Viet Nam. Ongoing and past biogas \nprojects,  however,  show  that  (i) up  to  70%  of  bio-slurry  is  still  being  discharged  into  the \nenvironment as pollutant; and (ii) since biogas production is not an income-earning activity, only \nbetter-off households with cash income can sustainably maintain the biogas systems. Using the \nbio-slurry in producing high-value crops (such as organic crops) would earn extra income for \nhouseholds and enable them to maintain their biogas systems.  \n \n8.  Recognizing  the  complex  interrelationship  between  bioenergy,  poverty,  and  food \nsecurity and the need to ensure climate-friendly development, the Global Bioenergy Partnership, \nand regional institutions are exerting efforts to work out a common set of principles, indicators, \nand methods of assessing and monitoring greenhouse gases for the sector.11 The TA will build \non this output in conducting pilot projects and developing capacity to expand investment in the \nGMS countries. In view of women\u2019s focal roles and responsibilities in household energy, waste \nmanagement,  and  food  security,  women\u2019s  groups  will  be  a  principal  target  of  capacity \ndevelopment activities and will be instrumental in expanding such activities. In this way, many \nrural women\u2013the key beneficiaries\u2013will benefit through improved health, strengthened energy \nand food security, and reduced work time.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact will be the improved use of biomass in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and \nViet Nam. The outcome will be the efficient operation of pilot biomass utilization projects.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will adopt both regional top\u2013down and grassroots bottom\u2013up approaches. At the \nregional  level,  it  will  push  for  high-level  dialogue  on  a  common  approach  to  bioenergy \ndevelopment for pro-poor climate change mitigation, and food and energy security. At the same \ntime, it will work with local governments and stakeholders to put in place the human and \ninstitutional capacity to increase investments that will help promote the efficient use of biomass \nto benefit the poor. The TA will include key activities as discussed in paras. 11\u201314.  \n \n11.  Output 1: Enhanced regional cooperation on bioenergy development that fosters \nand safeguards food security. To support a regional approach to climate-friendly development, \nmechanisms for harmonizing regulations and ensuring their compatibility with international trade \nobligations will be put in place. This will involve adopting common sets of sustainable indicators, \ncriteria  for  land  use,  bioenergy  standards, 12  certification  and  accreditation  systems,  a \ncomputerized  traceability  system,  and  eco-labeling  systems  using  a  common  method  of \nassessing greenhouse gas emissions. International and regional forums will be organized to \nfacilitate high-level dialogue within the region on bioenergy and food security policy issues and \nto encourage the exchange of information and skills in the wider use of novel technologies.  \n                                                \n10  ADB. 2002.

Output  2:  Pilot-tested  climate-friendly  biomass  investment  projects,  for  more \nextensive  implementation.  The  TA  will  support  the  development  of  at  least  10  pilot \ngender-responsive  investment  models  in  Cambodia,  the  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam.  These \ntechnologies will include but will not be limited to biogas, improved cookstoves, biochar, and an \ninclusive supply chain of certified biofuel and organic products. Technologies that have already \nbeen successfully tested on a smaller scale will be further reviewed under the TA, and an \nappropriate business model and institutional arrangements will be identified and pilot-tested. As \nall three countries already have national biogas programs, pilot implementation arrangements \nfor efficient biogas use by households will be set up under the TA as an ADB investment project \nin preparation for the ensuing investment project in the ADB project pipeline.13  \n \n13.  Output 3: Strengthened capacity for the efficient use of biomass. Gender-sensitive \ncapacity-building support will be provided to participating central and local governments, service \nproviders, communities, and women\u2019s groups, to strengthen institutional and technical capacity \nto expand biomass investments and to ensure sustainable uptake by rural communities after the \nwithdrawal of external support. Distance learning methods will be implemented to reach more \nrural communities. \n  \n14.  Output 4: Developed and disseminated knowledge products. Bioenergy production \nand use depend largely on available biomass resources and local socioeconomic conditions. \nBuilding on the work done by international agencies such as the Global Bioenergy Partnership, \nthe TA will develop a common methodology for assessing the supply of biomass and prioritizing \nits use for energy and food security. Knowledge products14 will be developed and links with \nregional centers of excellence will be created to promote knowledge transfer and cooperation \nbetween more advanced GMS countries and Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. An \nawareness campaign using mass media will be conducted. Baseline surveys will be carried out \nand a monitoring system will also be established.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The estimated cost of the TA is $4.6 million equivalent, of which $4.0 million equivalent \nwill be financed with a grant from the Nordic Development Fund to be administered by ADB.15 \nThe governments of Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam will fund the remaining $600,000 \nequivalent in kind by providing office accommodation, transport, data, support facilities, and staff \nsalaries. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency. 16  Overall  supervision  and  guidance  of  TA \nimplementation will be provided by a steering committee led by the WGA coordinators of the \nGMS countries and key development partners. The agriculture ministries17 of Cambodia, the \nLao PDR, and Viet Nam will be the implementing agencies. To ensure synergy with other GMS \n                                                \n13 In Viet Nam, where ADB has an ongoing biogas project, the TA will build capacity for the  use of bio-slurry. \n14 This  will  include  research  and  publications  on  new  technologies  promoted  under  the  R-CDTA  (improved \ncookstoves, biogas, and biochar systems). \n15 This amount includes ADB's administration fee, audit cost, bank charges, and provision for foreign exchange \nfluctuations (if any), to the extent that these items are not covered by the interest and investment income earned on \nthis grant, or any additional grant contribution from the Nordic Development Fund. \n16 Activities will be carried out through the WGA secretariat, supervised by staff of ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department. \n17 Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Cambodia); Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (Lao PDR); and \nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Viet Nam). (Details on implementation arrangements are in the \nSupplementary Appendix which is available on request). \n ", "  5\nregional cooperation programs, the TA will provide administration and support services through \nthe GMS environmental operations center in Bangkok. 18 A regional cooperation specialist to be \nhired by ADB for the WGA secretariat under the TA will provide regional cooperation support. \nAs the TA will overlap with the proposed regional project preparatory TA, the two consulting \nteams will work closely together, and the equipment purchased and information collected for this \nTA will be made available to the project preparatory team. After the TA, the equipment will be \nturned over to the implementing agencies for continuous use in nationwide activities.  \n \n17.  ADB will hire a consulting firm19 to provide 31 person-months of international consulting \nservices and 93 person-months of national consulting services to (i) strengthen institutional links \nand mechanisms for regional cooperation in bioenergy and food security; (ii) provide technical \nsupport for the design and implementation of pilot studies, the conduct of studies, and capacity \nbuilding; and (iii) monitor and report on the TA activities and output. The national consultants will \nwork with the international consultants to provide local knowledge, socioeconomic and baseline \ndata,  information  on  technologies  appropriate  for  local  conditions,  and  networking  among \nbioenergy and food security experts, NGOs, and practitioners. Two individual consultants (an \ninternational consultant for 10 person-months and a national consultant for 30 person-months) will \nalso be hired by ADB to ensure overall coherence with the GMS regional cooperation program. \nThese consultants will be hired by ADB20 according to its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). The consulting firm will be selected through quality- and \ncost-based selection at the standard 80:20 ratio. Disbursements under the TA will conform to \nADB\u2019s Technical Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). All procurement \nand equipment purchases should follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). Advance contracting will be used to speed up the mobilization of the consultants.  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 42 months. Appendix 3 provides the outline terms of \nreference for the consultants. Implementation progress will be reported at the annual meeting of \nthe WGA and the knowledge products from the TA will be posted on the GMS WGA website.   \n \nIV.
