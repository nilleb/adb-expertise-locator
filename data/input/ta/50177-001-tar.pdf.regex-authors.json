INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) is designed to provide \ntraining  and  capacity-building  programs  on  environmental  and  climate  change  issues  and \nadjudication for sustainable development. It follows the Building Capacity for Environmental \nProsecution, Adjudication, Dispute Resolution, Compliance, and Enforcement in Asia regional \nTA  project,1 which  resulted  in  judges  from  Southeast  and  South  Asia  making  significant \ndevelopments in environmental law in their jurisdictions. Asian judiciaries want to continue this \nmomentum and build on these gains. Judges throughout the region realize that more disputes \nrelated to climate change will be brought before the courts as the effects and impacts of climate \nchange  intensify.  However,  they  need  help  in  building  their  knowledge  and  capacity  to \nunderstand the various aspects of this phenomenon, and have requested to institutionalize \nthese training and capacity-building programs. This TA is designed to respond to this demand. \n \n2.  The Environment Operational Directions 2013\u20132020 of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) identified the strengthening of environmental governance and management capacity, and \nresponding to the climate change imperative as focus areas to support systemic, long-term, and \ntransformational  change  toward  green  growth  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific. 2 Building  sound \nenvironmental governance and management capacity will result in improved environmental and \nnatural resource management, including the strengthening of country systems and capacities \nfor environmental safeguards. Continued economic growth and poverty reduction in Asia and \nthe Pacific will not be possible without efforts to address global warming and climate change. \n \n3.  Many  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  recognize  the  unique  and  distinct \nleadership  role  the  judiciary  plays  in  the  environmental  enforcement  chain.  ADB  supports \nregional, subregional, and national work to help ensure greater environmental justice throughout \nthe region. Useful examples include the Asian Judges Network on Environment and the judicial \nroundtables in Southeast Asia and South Asia,3 which have helped develop judicial experience \nin environmental decision-making and strengthen judicial capacity. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  The twin issues of environmental justice and climate change have risen in prominence \nfrom 2000 to 2010, especially with extreme weather events, intense heat waves, rising sea \nlevels, and loss of wildlife and vegetation. The sense of urgency is not superficial or cosmetic: \n2016 was the hottest year on record, and the average temperature across global land and \nocean  surfaces  was  1.69  degrees  F  above  the  20th  century  average.4 Thus,  an  effective \nresponse to climate change is crucial, particularly in Asia and the Pacific where six of the top 10 \ncountries most affected by climate change are located.5 Of the 33 ADB DMCs, 20 belong to the \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2010.

In order of \n ", "2 \nClimate Vulnerable Forum (CVF).6 CVF countries are located in the climate front line and are \ndisproportionately affected by climate change. \n \n5.  Beyond the typical consequences of climate change lie a wide range of social impacts \nthat shape how climate change issues come before courts. Climate change issues do not come \nmerely in the form of environmental cases; they may also be integrated within broader questions \nsuch  as  economic,  political,  and  social  rights;  the  legality  of  legislative  and  regulatory \nframeworks; and the rights and duties of public officials under constitutional and administrative \nlaw. At the forefront of these issues are the interconnected aspects of community displacement, \nforced migration, and the disproportionate impact of climate change on vulnerable groups such \nas women, children, the poor, and indigenous peoples. In addition, droughts, floods, and land \nlosses  from  accretion  and  avulsion  have  given  rise  to  new  legal  questions  relating  to \nentitlements and remedies available to vulnerable groups. That is, do international human rights \nlaw and refugee law recognize climate change refugees? If so, what are their rights (if any) \nunder  conventional  and  customary  international  law?  What  are  the  concomitant  duties  of \nneighboring states, as well as their state of nationality? \n \n6.  It would thus be short-sighted and ill-advised to conceive of these issues as purely \nscientific. Climate change traverses a wide swath of policy questions, including sustainable \ndevelopment, corporate governance, urban and rural planning, taxation, green investment and \nfinance, and even constitutional discourse. This, along with the attendant economic and social \nconsequences triggered by climate change (e.g., community displacement, loss of livelihood, \ndecreased labor productivity), demonstrates the need for a multidisciplinary approach combining \neconomics, science, law, and policy. \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s  institutional  documents recognize  the  need for  an  integrated  climate  change \napproach. Strategy 2020 establishes good governance and capacity development as a driver for \nchange, and environment (including climate change) as a core operational area.7 Further, faced \nwith the increasingly serious environmental challenges besetting the region, ADB\u2019s Midterm \nReview of Strategy 2020 encourages scaling up assistance for climate change adaptation and \nmitigation.8 ADB\u2019s  Environment  Operational  Directions  2013\u20132020  identifies  strengthened \nenvironmental governance and management capacity as key to promoting the transition to \ngreen growth and addressing the causes and consequences of climate change (footnote 2). \n \n8.  Essential to the success of a multidisciplinary climate change approach is a credible rule \nof law system that ensures compliance with, and effective enforcement of, environmental laws \nand  regulations.  Judiciaries  and  specialized  environmental  tribunals  therefore  take  on  a \nfundamental  role  in  environmental  governance.  Judges  not  only  promulgate  decisions  in \nenvironmental cases (as well as other cases with an environmental nexus), but they also \ninfluence the gravity with which prosecutors, law enforcers, public interest groups, academia, \nand other stakeholders view environmental crimes and other climate change issues. Moreover, \njudicial review of environmental impact assessments and administrative decisions affects the \nspeed and consequences of rural and urban development on people and the environment. \n                                                                                                                                                       \nranking, the six countries are Myanmar, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Viet Nam, Pakistan, and Thailand.

However, climate change law and policy is a fast-evolving field that judges may not have \nformally studied in law school, much more engaged with through specialized training in judicial \nacademies. They may not even have access to reliable and accurate information about the \nscientific basis and consequences of climate change; the differences and the nexus between \nclimate change law and environmental law; the adaptation and mitigation initiatives undertaken \nto address the problem; the legal and regulatory framework on which these initiatives are \npredicated; and how scientific, expert, and technical evidence dovetail with existing evidentiary \nrules. Related issues are environmental valuation and damage assessment, expert testimony, \nenvironmental impact assessments, and the implications of the Paris climate agreement9 on \njudiciaries and case adjudication. This situation may undermine judges\u2019 efforts to comprehend \nthe relevance and broader implications of the evidence presented, and prevent them from \ngaining a more nuanced appreciation of the case itself. \n \n10.  The evolving nature of climate change litigation (e.g., the status of climate change \nrefugees and the states\u2019 obligations under international and domestic law) requires a thorough \nand programmatic approach to judicial training and capacity building. Generally, climate change \nlaw related to mitigation is more developed than law related to adaptation and disaster risk \nmanagement.10 Further, climate science usually evolves faster than legislative and regulatory \nframeworks. Climate change adaptation in environmental law often also involves tightening \ncurrent standards of environmental protection and damage prevention. This requires examining \nthe legal implications of adaptation, loss, and damage in DMCs, particularly in the context of the \nWarsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage.11 These factors necessitate that judges \nbe apprised of international legal principles or other innovative tools that may be used to \nadjudicate climate change cases in the absence of clear domestic law, especially in cases \ninvolving adaptation measures. Thus, the significance of engaging judges and enhancing their \ncapacity in climate change law and policy cannot be overemphasized, especially in light of \ncountry imperatives under the Paris Agreement and the climate vulnerability of ADB DMCs. \n \n11.  A related issue is the manner by which climate change training is undertaken. ADB\u2019s \nOffice  of  the  General  Counsel  (OGC)  seeks  to  complement  ad  hoc  seminars  with  the \ninstitutionalization of climate change law and policy in the DMCs\u2019 respective judicial academies. \nSupport  will  include  the  development  of  subject  country-specific  curricula,  as  well  as \npresentations and related materials. Doing so ensures that training is structured, cohesive, and \nlocally sustainable, and that knowledge is shared with all members of the judiciary regardless of \nthe judges\u2019 personal resource constraints. \n                                                \n9  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change.  The  Paris  Agreement. \nhttp://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php. \n10 Laws relating to disaster risk management have a long history in many DMCs, such as back to 1978 in the \nPhilippines and 1103 (over 900 years) in Viet Nam, when the first law on dikes was promulgated and where in the \n19th century damaging a dike carried the death sentence. Disaster risk management laws typically focused on \ndisaster response, and only more recently have been broadened to include disaster risk reduction. \n11  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n   \n12.  The impact of this demand-driven TA project will be law and policy reforms and the rule \nof  law  strengthened  through  the  effective  adjudication  of  climate  change  and  sustainable \ndevelopment issues. It builds on the gains of the environmental prosecution TA (footnote 1), \nespecially  in  terms  of  sustaining  and  advancing  earlier  accomplishments  in  environmental \nadjudication and rule of law decision-making. \n \n13.  The outcome will be seminal jurisprudence that is responsive to climate change and \nsustainable development issues developed by judiciaries in Asia and the Pacific. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n14.  The TA will assist judiciaries in developing seminal jurisprudence that is responsive to \nclimate change and sustainable development issues by (i) exposing them to global and regional \ndevelopments in this field, especially emerging concepts, principles, and jurisprudence from \ndifferent jurisdictions and international tribunals, through their participation in national, regional, \nand international conferences; (ii) identifying country-specific capacity gaps and addressing \nthem in a manner that institutionalizes training and lessons learned, which will then cascade to \nthe lowest-level courts; and (iii) preparing knowledge products that they can easily refer to while \nthey adjudicate disputes with climate change and sustainable development components. \n \n15.  Output 1: Capacity of the judiciary to respond to climate change and sustainable \ndevelopment issues increased and improved. This output includes support for (i) identifying \nneeds and gaps in the judicial systems of participating countries;12 (ii) organizing national, \nregional,  and  international  conferences;  and  enabling  the  participation  of  judges,  legal \nprofessionals,  concerned  government  ministries,  civil  society  organizations,  and  experts  in \nrelated fields in such events; (iii) holding country-specific activities such as training programs, \nworkshops, and seminars for judges, judicial officers, and legal professionals; (iv) establishing \nlinkages  between  the  Asian  Judges  Network  on  Environment  and  other  regional  and \ninternational networks and organizations, such as the Asian Environmental Compliance and \nEnforcement Network and the Global Judicial Institute for the Environment; and (v) managing \ncross-judiciary and intercountry training, knowledge-sharing, and enrichment activities. \n \n16.  Output 2: Training and capacity-building programs institutionalized. This output \nincludes (i) developing regional and country-specific environmental and climate change law \ncurricula and corresponding materials for judicial training programs to be institutionalized in \njudicial academies; (ii) developing a database of environment and climate change experts to \nfacilitate training; (iii) establishing linkages and partnerships with and between existing judicial \nacademies in the region, and fostering relationships with similar institutions around the world; \nand (iv) providing assistance in the designation of specialized judges through \u201cgreen benches\u201d \nor otherwise,13 with the support of environment and climate change-trained judges. \n \n                                                \n12 A country\u2019s participation will depend on demand from that country, to be confirmed through a needs assessment. \nThe exact number of participating countries in relation to the TA project is yet to be determined, given that the \nproject is demand-driven. The project is anticipated to have at least four pilot countries for outputs 1\u20133. \n13 A \u201cgreen bench\u201d is understood to mean a court or tribunal that specializes in handling cases and disputes related to \nthe environment and natural resources.  \n ", "5 \n17.  Output  3:  Regional  and  country-specific  knowledge  products  prepared  and \ndisseminated. This output includes (i) disseminating interregional, regional, and/or country-\nspecific  bench  books  on  environmental  and  climate  change  adjudication;14 (ii)  preparing \ninformation  and  education  materials  on  environmental  and  climate  change  law  such  as \nPowerPoint presentations, videos, brochures, and handbooks; and (iii) providing support for a \ndedicated website of resources and materials on environmental and climate change law and \nadjudication. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $944,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V).15 The participating governments may provide \ncounterpart  support  in the form  of  counterpart  staff,  local  communications,  organization  of \nworkshops, office space for consultants, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  ADB,  through  OGC,  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  this TA.  Relevant  judiciaries, \nacademia, networks, or selected civil society organizations will be the implementing partners. \nOGC will consult and seek the advice of relevant ADB regional departments in identifying \ncountry needs and demands, and in implementing the activities. OGC will be responsible for \nadministering and supervising the TA, and will be accountable for the delivery of the TA outputs. \nThe TA will be implemented from January 2017 to January 2020. \n \n20.  National consultants will be recruited for 54 person-months. Three national consultants \nwill be recruited for 12 person-months each on an intermittent basis to provide legal and policy \nsupport for the implementation of the TA. To conduct in-country training seminars and activities, \nfour national consultants, one in each participating country, will be recruited for 3 person-months, \neach on an intermittent basis. One national consultant will be recruited for 6 person-months on \nan intermittent basis to develop and maintain a website. Two international consultants will be \nrecruited for 6 person-months each on an intermittent basis. The terms of reference are in \nAppendix 3. The consultants will be recruited using the individual consultant selection method \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).16 \nAll  goods  and  equipment  to  be  procured  under  the  TA  will  be  procured  following  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). Disbursement under the TA will \nfollow ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). OGC will work closely with the implementing partners and consultants to be recruited \nunder the TA to ensure that the TA outputs are delivered on schedule. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $944,000 on a grant basis for \nDeveloping Judicial Capacity for Adjudicating Climate Change and Sustainable Development \nIssues, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n14 A bench book provides a judge with an overview and reference of relevant procedures to serve as a guide in the \ndisposition of cases. Some bench books provide both procedural and substantive references for the judge. \n15 No objection will be obtained from the government of the participating country before financing any activity in that \ncountry. \n16 To reduce the administrative burden and improve economy, efficiency, and value for money, consulting services \nunder the TA will be engaged under output-based (lump-sum) contracts, where appropriate. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nLaw and policy reform and the rule of law strengthened through the effective adjudication of climate \nchange  and  sustainable  development  issues  (Strategy  2020;  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020; \nEnvironment Operational Directions 2013\u20132020 and Sustainable Development Goals)a \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nSeminal  By 2019    Law schools and law \njurisprudence that is  a.
