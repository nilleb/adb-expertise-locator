A total of 63 person-months of consulting services will be engaged, with  26 person-months to be \nprovided by individual  international consultants and 37 person-months by a consulting firm (20 person-\nmonths international and 17 person-months national).  \n \nI.  Background \n \nA.  The Project \n \n2.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will facilitate future investment in sustainable \nocean  economy  development  through  two  main  activities:  (i)  assessment  of  marine  resource \ncommercialization  prospects  (including  energy,  seafood,  and  tourism)  and  identification  of  potential \ninvestment projects in selected developing member countries (DMCs); and (ii) stakeholder engagement \nand knowledge management on mechanisms to facilitate large-scale investments and to accelerate \nfinancing of selected projects.   \n \nB.  Major Elements and Outputs \n \n3.   Output 1: Healthy ocean investments catalyzed.  The TA will assess existing policies, \nregulatory frameworks, technologies, business models, learning from existing developments \nwhich  will  be  linked to  opportunities created by aggregation  of  activities  and suitability  for \nexpansion via various policy approaches informed by global and regional experience in large-\nscale energy development. The potential financing modalities will also be assessed   with focus \non sea use and cultural issues to meet local community expectations. Specific attention will be \nmade to engagement with local, national, and international stakeholders to support and secure \ncommitments  to  buy  energy  outputs  and  other  value-added  products  to  anchor  MARES \ninvestments. A structured process of discovery (surveys, interviews, and workshops) and curation \nwill identify a pipeline of investment projects which can be developed to match advanced market \ncommitments. The TA will support preliminary assessments of economic, environmental, social, \nand technical aspects of candidate investments, with recommendations for further development \nvia transaction TAs within the ADB Acton Plan for Healthy Ocean and Sustainable Blue Economy. \nInvestment operations will include public-private partnerships with sovereign and non-sovereign \nfinancial assistance. The frontier business models and leading technology to be explored will \nparticularly be opportunistic for upper middle-income countries especially in the non-sovereign \nsphere.    \n \n4.   Output 2: Knowledge in healthy oceans improved. Initial outcomes of the research, \nconsultations, and de-risking of prioritized investments on current commercial activities in the core \nMARES sectors will be shared with DMCs governments, local communities, and other key \nstakeholders through knowledge sharing events including workshops, seminars and investor \nforums.
