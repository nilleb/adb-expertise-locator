THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan (PBL) to Nepal for the Civil Aviation Sector Improvement Program. The report also \ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Supporting  the  Civil  Aviation  Sector \nImprovement Program, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The  program  will  provide  budget  support  for  civil  aviation  sector  reforms  in  the \nrestructuring of the current Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) and the strengthening of its \noversight functions, management accountability, and operational efficiency.  The program is \naligned  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Strategy  2030  operational  priorities  of \n(i) strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity  through  civil  aviation  sector  reforms \n(operational priority 6), (ii) fostering regional cooperation and integration through attracting more \ninternational flights with enhanced aviation safety (operational priority 7), and (iii) accelerating \nprogress in gender equality by introducing gender-related initiatives (operational priority 2).1 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Macroeconomic context. Nepal\u2019s economic growth is robust, reaching 7.1% in fiscal year \n(FY) 2019, which is much higher than the 10-year average of 4.3% during FY2009\u2013FY2018. The \nbudget  balance  had  been  in  surplus  before  FY2016.  However,  increased  government \nexpenditures and fiscal transfers to subnational governments rapidly widened the fiscal deficit to \n6.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) in FY2018. The deficit for FY2019 had been projected at \naround 8% of GDP but was actually 4.6% mainly because of under-execution and back-loading \nof spending resulting from federal and subregional government capacity constraints. External \nsector stability is vulnerable over the medium term because of a rapidly rising trade deficit. This \nmay only be partially offset by inflows of remittances from overseas, which declined from 29.5% \nof GDP in FY2016 to about 25.3% of GDP in FY2019. The current account deficit reached \n$2.4 billion, or 7.7% of GDP, in FY2019\u2014significantly higher than the $95.7 million (0.4% of GDP) \nfigure for FY2017.2 Based on the scenario before the outbreak of the new coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19)\u2014despite some balance-of-payment pressure, financial stability risk, slower growth \nin neighboring countries, and sluggish remittance inflows\u2014the near-term outlook for growth is \nmoderate (about 6%), attributed to a stable political environment, a robust tourism industry, and \nongoing reconstruction from the earthquake in 2015. Public debt is estimated at 30.1% of GDP \nas of mid-2019, which remains lower than in other low-income countries. Debt sustainability \nanalysis indicates that none of the debt burden indicators breach the indicative threshold values, \nthough Nepal\u2019s public debt is projected to gradually increase over the medium term. Development \nspending financed by concessional inflow should be accommodated since it keeps the debt \nburden in check while allowing for needed development expenditures. The COVID-19 shock, \nhowever, is expected to severely impact economic activities and lower growth to 1.0% in FY2020 \nthrough a significant reduction in remittances and tourism, and broader disruptions brought by the \npandemic.3 Nepal continues to be assessed at low risk of debt distress for both external and \n \n1  ADB. 2018.

Nepal is a landlocked country of \ntremendous geographic diversity, with the northern rim of the Gangetic Plain in the south, the \nHimalaya Mountains in the north, and rugged and hilly terrain in between. Civil aviation is crucial \nto transport, trade, and tourism, and provides indispensable links to hilly and mountainous areas \nthat are inaccessible by other transport modes. Tourism is one of the major economic activities in \nNepal and a top government priority. It is estimated that tourism brought in $651 million in foreign \nexchange in FY2019, equivalent to 65% of goods exports (footnote 2). Travel and tourism in Nepal \ngenerated an estimated $1.92 billion (7.8% of GDP) in 2018, including indirect and induced \ncontributions.5 Considering that more than 80% of international tourists come to Nepal by air, \nimprovement of the civil aviation sector is essential for tourism to support the country\u2019s economic \ndevelopment. \n \n5.  Challenges in the civil aviation sector. Nepal has a large airport network, albeit with \nlow  capacity,  comprising  one  international  airport,  Tribhuvan  International  Airport  (TIA)  in \nKathmandu, and 53 domestic airports.6 TIA is the sole gateway airport to Nepal. It handled \n4.1 million international passengers in 2019, up from 1.8 million in 2008. It also serves as the \nlargest domestic airport, handling 3.2 million domestic passengers in 2019\u2014accounting for about \nhalf of the country\u2019s domestic air traffic.7 TIA handled 32,439 international and 91,816 domestic \nflights in 2019. With the tourism industry expected to continue to grow, it is expected under pre-\nCOVID scenario that air traffic will steadily increase 3%\u20135% annually (para. 9).8  \n \n6.  Although TIA plays a critical role as an international gateway and domestic air hub, its \nclose  proximity  to  Kathmandu\u2019s  city  center  restrains  expansion  beyond  the  current  airport \nboundary. Aircraft need to occupy the runway for 2\u20133 additional minutes for takeoff and landing \nbecause the inefficient taxiway caps aircraft movements, particularly during peak hours. The \nnumber of parking spots at aprons (international: 9 and domestic: 17) is not sufficient to handle \npeak-hour parking demand, causing unnecessary waiting time for spot allocation. It also restricts \nthe number of domestic operating aircrafts based in TIA for nighttime parking. Combined with \nlimited airspace in the Kathmandu Valley, the insufficient capacity of airside facilities forces \nairplanes to remain on hold in the sky, leading to frequent flight delays and risks. For landside \nfacilities, the current international terminal building handled 4.1 million passengers in 2019, \nbeyond its annual capacity of 3.2 million. Heavy congestion and lower quality of services are \nobserved  during  peak  hours;  the  international  terminal  building  handles  more  than \n2,200 passengers per hour, about 70% more than its per-hour capacity of 1,350. The number of \ninternational passengers is projected to further increase to 6.1 million by 2028. TIA will have to \nuse its existing space more efficiently, while more flights must be routed through other airports.9 \n \n7.  Aviation safety in Nepal is another challenge.

The CAAN has achieved significant progress in improving its \nsafety oversight capability. In its 2017 audit of the CAAN, the Universal Safety Oversight Audit \nProgramme raised the rate of effective implementation of the CAAN from 46.96% in 2009 to \n66.76%  in  2017,  above  the  Global  Aviation  Safety  Plan  (GASP)  benchmark  of  60%. 10 \nNonetheless, negative safety oversight margins were still identified in (i) air navigation; and \n(ii) support in organization, legislation, and accident and incident investigation.11 During 2009\u2013\n2018, 21 accidents involving Nepalese-registered aircrafts claimed 164 lives. These accidents \nand fatalities were mainly because of controlled flight into terrain (74% of fatalities), loss of control \nin  flight (24%  of fatalities),  and  runway  excursion.  There  were  192  incidents  in  2016  and \n159 incidents in 2017, in which air operation and maintenance were found to be the predominant \nreason.12 The CAAN prepared the Nepal Aviation Safety Plan (NASP), 2018\u20132022 in congruence \nwith ICAO\u2019s GASP to continually enhance aviation safety performance by reducing fatalities and \nthe risk of fatalities through the development of a harmonized aviation safety strategy and its \nimplementation.13 \n \n8.  The global civil aviation sector is heavily regulated, particularly in maintaining high-level \nsafety  and  security  to  be  applied  across  the  countries.  ICAO  is  responsible  for  ensuring \nstandardized global procedures and processes with respect to civil aviation. As a signatory to the \nConvention on International Civil Aviation, Nepal is generally bound by the requirements of the \nconvention. There are 19 annexes to the convention, divided into specific areas of civil aviation \nover which ICAO has authority. These include Security (Annex 17) and Safety Management \n(Annex 19). The annexes provide details of the standards and procedures that ICAO member \nstates must follow to ensure safe and efficient civil aviation operations. With regard to safety \nmanagement, the standards and recommended practices (SARPs) in Annex 19 are intended to \nassist the states in managing aviation safety risks. The GASP is a means for ICAO member \nstates, including Nepal, to achieve compliance with the ICAO safety-related SARPs, and the \nGASP assists the states in strengthening their capabilities in the management of safety through \na structural process. \n \n9.  Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of the tourism industry to the Nepalese \neconomy will remain unchanged over the medium term though its character and business models \nmight be adjusted accordingly under the new normal. As such, directing well-targeted investments \ninto the key airports and creating an enabling environment for the improvement of the civil aviation \nsector are still critical to support Nepal\u2019s long-term economic development.14 The outbreak of \nCOVID-19  has  serious  negative  impacts  on  Nepalese  aviation  and  tourism  sectors.  All \ninternational flights were temporarily suspended in March 2020, and the government had to \ncancel the Visit Nepal 2020 campaign, which was just launched in January 2020 to attract two \nmillion visitors. The depth and duration of the shock are uncertain. There could be several \nscenarios on how soon international connectivity will be restored, depending partly on the length \nof containment measures adopted by Nepal and other major economies. Nonetheless, continuous \nperformance improvement of the civil aviation sector needs to underpin tourism to prepare for \n \n10 ICAO. 2019. Global Aviation Safety Plan, 2020\u20132022.

Government reform agenda in civil aviation sector. Nepal has maintained a traditional \ncivil aviation sector structure whereby the functions of regulation, safety oversight, and service \nprovision are carried out by one entity: the CAAN. The roles of regulator and service provider \nlodged in a single organization create a conflict of interest. The regulatory function may not \nprovide  adequate  oversight  on  service  provision,  may  raise  operating  costs,  and  result  in \nsuboptimal performance as a service provider. There are also repercussions on aviation safety, \nwhich have been noted and highlighted by international aviation agencies. ICAO\u2019s GASP, 2020\u2013\n2022 states that an independent regulatory authority should be established and maintained, which \nincludes separation of oversight functions from service provision functions where these exist \nwithin the authority (footnote 10). The European Commission has banned Nepalese airlines from \nflying to the European Union because of a lack of safety oversight by the aviation authority of \nNepal.15 To remedy this situation, the NASP (footnote 13) has named the bifurcation of CAAN as \na priority measure to comply with international standards. The change of the governance structure \nin the civil aviation sector is the most fundamental and imminent reform requirement. While the \npreparation of bills on the reforms was initially supported by the ADB-funded Air Transport \nCapacity Enhancement Project, the government continued working on finalizing the bills until their \nsubmission to the Parliament.16 The main objective of the new bills is to reform the civil aviation \nsector in Nepal by bifurcating the roles of the regulator and the operator (CAAN) into separate \nentities. \n \n11.  ADB assistance to the sector. ADB is Nepal\u2019s key partner in the civil aviation sector to \nsupport  various  aspects  of  its  development,  including  planning,  physical  investment,  and \ninstitutional reform. ADB\u2019s involvement in Nepal\u2019s aviation sector started with a $70 million loan \nand a $10 million grant to Nepal through the 2009 Air Transport Capacity Enhancement Project \n(footnote 16). The project aimed to enhance safety and capacity at TIA and three regional \nairports.17 The draft bills to bifurcate CAAN, as per ICAO\u2019s guidance materials and international \nbest practices, were prepared under the project, based on which ADB has conducted policy \ndialogues  with  the  government  to  strengthen  aviation  safety  from  an  oversight  function \nperspective. The Transport Project Preparatory Facility assisted CAAN in (i) preparing the TIA \nmaster plan to guide future investments for the airport, and (ii) developing the designs of required \nairside and landside facilities.18 Through the South Asia Tourism Infrastructure Development \nProject, ADB is funding the upgrade of Gautam Buddha Airport, one of the four domestic hub \nairports in Nepal, to accommodate the increasing number of tourists to Lumbini.19 Review \nmissions  of  the  ADB-funded  projects  observed  that  the  CAAN\u2019s  capacity  for  (i)  contract \nmanagement and procurement; and (ii) investment preparation needs to be strengthened to \nimprove implementation performance. Lessons from the reviews are incorporated in the policy \nactions  of the  program.  For the  Air  Service  Authority  of  Nepal  (ASAN),  these  include  the \n \n15 European Commission. 2019.

The ADB program team has closely coordinated \nwith other development partners and diplomatic communities in Nepal, including through the \nInternational Development Partner Group. Because of the ban on Nepalese airlines flying to the \nEuropean Union, its member states theoretically have a strong interest in the proposed civil \naviation sector reforms to enhance the oversight function, and they could provide various support \nfor the reforms if called upon. ICAO provides oversight authorities and service providers in Nepal \nwith the SARPs, relevant guidance materials, and trainings, as required. \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n13.  Policy reform. A two-tranche stand-alone PBL is proposed. The first tranche, to be \nreleased on loan effectiveness, includes the legal framework for the reforms to bifurcate the CAAN \ninto a regulator, which is the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAANepal), and a service provider, \nwhich is the ASAN. The draft bills include fundamental elements of the new organizations such \nas mandate; governance structure; roles and responsibilities of the board; executive bodies; \ninternal and external audits; decision-making process including appointment of executive heads, \nstaff management, remuneration and benefits; funding sources; and accounting. 20 The two first \ntranche policy actions on submission of the bills to the Parliament have been achieved. The \nsecond  tranche  has  11  policy  actions  that  will  support  the  establishment  of  high-quality \norganizations. To support this, the tranche 2 policy actions cover more advanced elements of \norganizational  development  such  as  preparation  of  an  integrated  institutional  management \nstrategy, development of key performance indicators, and gender equality and social inclusion \n(GESI) initiatives. There are three reform areas: \n \n(i)  Reform area 1: Legal and implementation framework of the civil aviation \nsector reforms approved. A critical step to bifurcate CAAN into a regulator and \na service provider is to provide the legal basis for the establishment of the two \nauthorities. In tranche 1, the program will support the government in approving the \ntwo draft bills for the establishment of the CAANepal and the ASAN, and submitting \nthese to the Parliament for consideration (footnote 20). The draft bills stipulate \n(a) duties, responsibilities, and rights of the new entities; (b) establishment, duties, \nresponsibilities, and rights of boards; (c) appointment, duties, responsibilities, and \nrights of executive heads; (d) staff management, including staff numbers, gratuity \nfund,  principles  of  staff  transfer,  remuneration,  and  benefits;  (e)  transfer  of \nproperties, assets, and liabilities; (f) separated fund sources; (g) accounting rules, \nincluding internal audit; (h) provisions on conflicts of interest; and (i) procedures to \nset rules to implement the acts (footnote 20). The act for the ASAN also allows the \nprivate sector, subject to government approval, to be involved in the construction, \ndevelopment, operation, and management of airports in Nepal. Under tranche 2, \nthe program will support the implementation and enforcement of the laws once the \nbills are approved and enacted. \n \n(ii)  Reform area 2: Independent regulatory body for the civil aviation established \nand  functionalized.  To  establish  and  maintain  an  independent  regulatory \n \n20 The bills are (i) a bill (that will become the Nepal Civil Aviation Authority Act) to amend and consolidate laws regarding \nCAAN, and (ii) a bill (that will become the Nepal Air Service Authority Act) for the establishment and management of \nASAN. Both bills were endorsed by the Cabinet in January 2020, and submitted to the Parliament in February 2020. \n ", "6 \noversight authority, which should be separated from a service provision function, \nis an important safety enhancement initiative to avoid conflicts of interest following \nICAO\u2019s GASP, 2020\u20132022. The program will support the establishment of the \nCAANepal as a regulator with appropriate oversight functions as stipulated in the \nbill. The CAANepal shall develop an effective system to promulgate technical \nguidance and tools to effectively perform the safety oversight functions, and to \nrecruit, train, and retain qualified and sufficient technical personnel to support \nregulatory oversight. Under the program, key performance indicators to measure \nthe regulatory functions will be developed following ICAO\u2019s SARPs in the areas of \n(a) aviation safety; (b) aviation security; (c) licensing and certification of service \nproviders; (d) authorization and approval of aviation activities; (e) surveillance, \ninspection,  and  audits  of  service  providers;  and  (f)  capacity  development \nrequirements. The program will also support improvement of the CAANepal\u2019s \norganizational structure to comply with ICAO\u2019s SARPs.21 An updated NASP will be \napproved based on ICAO\u2019s latest safety audit to Nepal, ICAO\u2019s GASP, and other \nsafety standards. \n \n(iii)  Reform area 3: Independent service provider for the civil aviation established \nand functionalized. The ASAN will be established as an independent service \nprovider  to  focus  its  business  domain  on  the  construction,  operation,  and \nmanagement of airports. The newly established service provider will need to \nimprove its operational efficiency to provide better services to airport users and to \npromote  efficient  resource  use  through  more  accountable  institutional \nmanagement. The new service provider will remain a government authority as per \nthe bill for the establishment and management of the ASAN, but it allows for private \nsector  involvement,  subject  to  government  approval,  in  the  construction, \ndevelopment, operation, and management of airports.22 The program will support \nthe establishment of the ASAN and its transformation into a high-quality entity with \nmore accountable management and efficient operations. The program includes \ndevelopment of (a) a medium-term business plan; (b) a medium-term financial \nframework and forecast financial statements; and (c) a financial management \nimprovement  plan  comprising  the  introduction  of  accrual-based  financial \nstatements,  an  enterprise  resource  planning  system,  and  a  management \naccounting system. Under the program, key performance indicators to measure \nthe service provider functions will be developed in the areas of (a) core business \nand  functions,  (b)  aviation  safety,  (c)  aviation  security,  (d)  service  quality, \n(e) productivity and cost-effectiveness, (f) financial management, and (g) social \nand environmental performance. The program will also support GESI initiatives \nthrough a GESI audit of the ASAN and a GESI operational plan. To strengthen the \ncapacity of the ASAN, the program will further support the (a) creation of new \nseparate units for environmental and social, as well as legal and/or procurement \nservices; and (b) development of an operational capacity program. \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s value addition. The program will (i) build on outputs of ADB\u2019s assistance and \ninitiatives to align with international good practices and ADB\u2019s strategic objectives; (ii) add value \nby creating an institutional environment for enhanced civil aviation safety and sector efficiency; \n \n21 The CAANepal shall comply with Annex 19 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Safety Management); \nICAO Doc 9859, Safety Management Manual; and ICAO Doc 9734, Safety Oversight Manual. \n22 Article 12 (Joint Investment) of the bill stipulates that the authority (ASAN), after obtaining approval from the \nGovernment of Nepal, can construct, operate, or manage airports under public, private, or joint partnership. ", "7 \nand (iii) facilitate other interventions of the government, development partners, and the private \nsector in improving civil aviation as well as further developing the tourism sector in the country. \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Nepal, 2020\u20132024 aims to address major development \nconstraints by pursuing three objectives: (i) improved infrastructure for private sector-led growth, \n(ii) improved access to devolved services, and (iii) environmental sustainability and resilience.23 \nThe transport sector is a key area for implementing the strategy, and ADB places high value on \nimproving the infrastructure and operational capacity of TIA and increasing air safety through the \ncivil aviation reforms. The program is listed in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Nepal, \n2020\u20132022 (footnote 14). This will be the first ADB transport sector policy-based loan for Nepal, \nand it will complement infrastructure investment, which is in line with recommendations made by \nthe 2020 sector-wide evaluation of ADB support for transport.24 \n \n15.  Effect of COVID-19 on program implementation. Since the proposed policy reform \nfocuses specifically on the governance structure of the civil aviation sector in line with the \nestablished international safety standards and practices, the COVID-19 pandemic will not affect \nthe policy actions under the program. The proposed program to be implemented over the next \n2 years will provide more air travel opportunities with higher safety and service standards and \nsupport the quick recovery of the Nepalese economy once the pandemic is contained. The \nadverse impact of the pandemic on program implementation is considered limited since the \nprogram does not involve physical activities such as construction and transportation of equipment \nand materials. However, the progress of the reform will be closely monitored especially in terms \nof  necessary  resource  allocation  for  implementation.  From  another  perspective,  the  quick-\ndisbursing  proposed  PBL,  particularly  with  $25  million  of  tranche  1  to  be  released  upon \neffectiveness, will also assist the government in securing external fiscal financing to mitigate \neconomic and social shocks caused by COVID-19 (para. 17). \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n16.  The program is aligned with ICAO\u2019s GASP (footnote 10) and NASP (footnote 13) to avoid \npotential conflicts of interest within the CAAN (which has both oversight and operation functions), \nand to secure the effective safety oversight of the service provider. The operational functions of \nthe CAAN will be transformed into the ASAN with (i) clearly defined objectives and duties, and \n(ii) independent management and funding structures to improve the operational efficiency and \naccountability of airports in Nepal. The civil aviation reforms under the program will also allow the \nASAN,  the  service  provider,  to  involve  the  private  sector  in  construction,  operation,  and \nmanagement  of  airports,  which  could  achieve  efficiency  gains  in  airport  operations. 25 \nStrengthened oversight functions and airport management capacity through the civil aviation \nreforms will help the government address constraints on air travel to and from Nepal and improve \nsubstandard airport services, contributing to international tourism development that will ripple \nacross the whole economy. \n \n \n \n \n \n23 ADB. 2019.

Manila: ADB. \n25 Private sector involvement is subject to government approval in consideration of the following factors: security and \nsafety of the civil aviation sector, social impacts on stakeholders, country context of possibility of private sector \ninvolvement, modalities of the participation, market conditions, and potential economic benefits. \n ", "8 \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n17.  Nepal faces a rising deficit\u2014from 3.1% of GDP in FY2017 to 4.6% of GDP in FY2019\u2014\nlargely because of increasing expenditures on grants, land, buildings, and civil works.26 In the \noriginal FY2020 budget, the government\u2019s total gross borrowing requirement is estimated at \n$4.1 billion, of which $2.5 billion will be from external borrowing. External borrowing will comprise \nmostly concessional official development assistance and export\u2013import loans, of which program \nloans are about $350 million. In addition, the outbreak of COVID-19 will negatively affect Nepal\u2019s \neconomy through lower tourism demand and possible declines in exports as well as overseas \nworkers\u2019 remittances. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated that COVID-19 will lower \ngrowth in Nepal to 1.0% and widen the country\u2019s fiscal deficit to 7.2% of GDP in FY2020 (footnote \n3). The COVID-19 shock has given rise to an urgent external financing need of 3.0% of GDP and \na fiscal financing need of 2.6% of GDP in FY2020. The government is therefore seeking budget \nsupport from development partners to fill these gaps. ADB closely coordinated with the World \nBank and IMF through the government to respond to public health emergencies and mitigate \nadverse economic and social impacts caused by COVID-19, and provided in May 2020 a loan of \n$250 million for COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program.27 The proposed \nloan will not only secure fiscal headroom to cover additional expenses on the civil aviation reforms \nbut also contribute to addressing the government\u2019s urgent fiscal needs. \n \n18.  For the proposed PBL to the civil aviation sector, the Government of Nepal has requested \na concessional loan of $50 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help \nfinance the program. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an \ninterest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The funds will be released in two \ntranches\u2014$25 million at loan effectiveness and $25 million about 24 months later\u2014once the \ngovernment has complied with the policy actions. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The  executing  agency  for  the  program  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  the \nimplementing agencies will be the Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation and the CAAN \nestablished under the Nepal Civil Aviation Authority Act, 2053 (1996). After the bifurcation of the \nCAAN, the implementation responsibility under the CAAN shall be transferred to the CAANepal, \nwhich will be established under the Nepal Civil Aviation Act, and the ASAN, which will be \nestablished under Air Service Authority of Nepal Act. The CAAN will appoint a transition team to \nlead the implementation of activities required for its bifurcation, and the transition team will be \ntransferred to the CAANepal and the ASAN after they are established to assist the CAANepal\u2019s \ndirector general and the ASAN\u2019s managing director in setting up the new entities, including \nimplementation of the policy actions in tranche 2. \n \n20.  ADB will undertake periodic review missions to (i) confirm progress and fulfillment of policy \nactions for tranche release; (ii) monitor continued applicability of the assumptions that might \nimpact program success, as well as specified risks and their mitigating measures; and (iii) advise \non actions to maintain effective implementation within the program period. \n \n \n26 ADB. 2019.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n22.  The attached transaction technical assistance (TA) will assist the implementing agencies \nto comply with the program\u2019s second tranche policy conditions.30 The TA is estimated to cost \n$550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial  Fund  (TASF-6).  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart staff, office accommodation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n23.  The implementation arrangements for the TA will be aligned with those of the PBL. ADB \nwill administer the TA. The executing agencies will be the CAAN, the CAANepal, and the ASAN. \nThe transition teams of the executing agencies will implement the TA components. A total of \n10.5 person-months of international and 23 person-months of national consultancy inputs will be \nrequired. A consulting firm and individual consultants will be recruited in accordance with the ADB \nProcurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  its  associated  project \nadministration instructions and/or staff instructions.31 The TA will be implemented from October \n2020 to September 2022. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n24.  Several outputs of the program have technical components in the area of civil aviation \nsafety. These policy actions shall comply with relevant safety requirements of ICAO\u2019s international \nSARPs that are stipulated in Annex 19 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Safety \nManagement).32 The policy actions, in principle, intend to comply with the minimum safety \nstandards as per the SARPs; however, selected critical actions aim at satisfying a higher level of \nthe recommended practices of the SARPs. Compliance of the technical policy actions will be \nmonitored and confirmed with the support of individual consultants engaged under the attached \nTA. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n25.  A governance risk assessment was conducted in line with the implementation guidelines \nof ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan.33 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was also explained to and discussed with the government and CAAN. \nAreas of possible governance risks that may affect program implementation include (i) political \nsupport for sensitive aspects of the reforms, and (ii) the institutional dimension of the program. \n \n28 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Tranche 1 policy actions will have been completed by June 2020.

Manila. \n ", "10 \nFull  understanding  of  all  stakeholders,  including  CAAN  employees,  on  the  objectives  and \nprocedures of the reforms is key to successful implementation. In addition, since the PBL includes \nthe bifurcation of the implementing agency itself (CAAN, which is responsible for uninterrupted \ncivil aviation safety and airport operations), special attention needs to be paid to the smooth \ntransition to the two new authorities (ASAN and CAANepal) to ensure that both entities commence \ntheir respective operations having already met governance, management, staffing, financial, and \nbusiness  requirements.  The  transitions  will  be  closely  monitored  through  ADB\u2019s  continued \nengagement with the government along with TA support and implementation monitoring by ADB. \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n26.  Nepal derives significant income from tourism activities, and this has become one of the \nkey  sectors  driving  national  development.  Considering  that  an  overwhelming  majority  of \ninternational tourists come to Nepal by air, improvement of the civil aviation sector is essential for \ntourism to flourish and contribute to the economic development of the country. The proposed \nimprovements in the regulatory and policy sphere will remove concerns about Nepal\u2019s oversight \nfunctions relating to civil aviation safety and create an enabling business environment for better \nair connectivity with the rest of the world. Better aviation will also enhance associated commercial \nbusiness activities and will have a positive ripple effect on other sectors such as agriculture, \nindustry, energy, and transport. Overall, the economic impact of an improved civil aviation sector \nwill have substantial impact on the country\u2019s poverty alleviation programs. \n \n27.  The proposed reforms under the PBL to bifurcate CAAN into a regulator and a service \nprovider may have negative impacts on the working conditions of CAAN employees. The draft \nbills (footnote 20), however, provide relevant clauses to safeguard CAAN employees through \n(i) employees\u2019 submitting applications to transfer to the new entities, (ii) keeping at least the same \nlevel of remuneration and benefits after the transfer, (iii) providing a necessary retirement scheme \nin consideration of the previous working records in CAAN, and (iv) establishing a gratuity fund in \neach authority. The CAAN and its successors (CAANepal and ASAN) will communicate with \nstakeholders, especially employees, about the transformation and its impacts; the attached TA \nwill help with these communication efforts. \n \n28.  There are pressing needs in the global civil aviation sector to advance gender equality \nand the empowerment of women. ICAO made commitments, in Resolution A39-30: ICAO Gender \nEquality Programme Promoting Participation of Women in the Global Aviation Sector, to enhance \ngender equality by 2030 at all professional and higher levels of employment in the sector. In line \nwith global trends and requirements, the civil aviation sector in Nepal needs to transform its \ninstitutions, particularly the service provider, to be more advanced and forward- looking in terms \nof gender inclusion. The program will support GESI initiatives of the ASAN by (i) conducting a \nGESI  audit  of  the  ASAN,  (ii)  developing  a  GESI  operational  plan,  and  (iii) increasing  the \npercentage of women and the socially excluded in the ASAN\u2019s workforce. The program is \ncategorized some gender elements. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n29.  The program is confined to policy reforms and will not involve any physical activities. None \nof the policy actions will result in or lead to involuntary resettlement or adversely affect indigenous \npeoples.34 No adverse environmental impacts have been identified and, as such, the program is \n \n34 Matrix of Potential Environmental and Social Impacts and Measures (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2).
