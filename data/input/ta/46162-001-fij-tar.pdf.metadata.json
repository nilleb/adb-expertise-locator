INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the  2011 regional  Pacific  Platform for Disaster  Risk  Management meetings, \nPacific  developing  member  country  (DMC)  governments  stressed  the  importance  of  (i) \neffectively preventing and risk proofing development investments and (ii) strengthening disaster \nrisk management and related human resource capacities. Pacific DMCs also called for further \nsupport to better integrate disaster and climate risk information into development planning. The \ntechnical assistance (TA) aims to respond to this request by assisting Fiji, Papua New Guinea, \nSamoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu, to build their capacity in mainstreaming climate \nchange and natural disaster risks into urban and infrastructure planning using available data \nand risk models. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Pacific DMCs, as small island developing states, are vulnerable to economic shocks, \nnatural  hazards,  and  climate  change,  which  pose  a  significant  challenge  to  sustainable \ndevelopment and progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Pacific DMCs \nare highly exposed to the adverse effects of climate change and natural hazards, including \nfloods, droughts, tropical cyclones, earthquakes, and tsunamis, and have a low capacity to \nmanage the resulting risks. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity \nof  extreme  weather  events  and  to  introduce  new  hazards  such  as  sea  level  rise  and \ntemperature  changes.  The  2009  tsunami  that  hit  Samoa  caused  high  human  losses  and \nextensive damage to the country\u2019s infrastructure. The cost of recovery was estimated at 22% of \nSamoa\u2019s gross domestic product over a 3\u20134 year period.2 In April 2012, Fiji was affected by \nsevere flooding, resulting in damages equivalent to around 1.5% of the country\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct.3 \n \n3.  At the same time, poorly planned urban development is increasing the exposure of \nPacific DMCs to natural hazard and climate change-related events. The large concentration of \npeople, infrastructure, enterprises, and public institutions within cities and towns makes urban \nareas more vulnerable to these events compared with rural areas. Urban centers in the region \nare also predominantly situated in hazard-prone locations such as in low-lying coastal areas that \nare exposed to flooding, sea level rise, and storm surge. Pacific DMCs are rapidly urbanizing: \nFiji,  Papua  New  Guinea,  Samoa,  Solomon  Islands, Tonga,  and  Vanuatu  have  among the \nhighest urban growth rates in the Pacific region. As the region\u2019s urban centers expand, there is \ngrowing  unplanned  encroachment  into  higher  risk  areas,  such  as  exposed  shorelines  or \nlocations that are prone to flooding. \n   \n4.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC),4 \nand the World Bank jointly launched the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing \nInitiative  (PCRAFI)  in  2007  to  increase  the financial  resilience  of  Pacific  DMCs  to  natural \ndisasters and to enable them to better cope with the aftermath of such events.5 The PCRAFI \naims to (i) develop a regional catastrophe risk insurance pool to enhance the capacity of Pacific \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 June 2012. \n2  Government of Samoa. 2009.

Manila (TA 6496-REG). \n ", "2 \n \nDMCs to manage natural disasters, (ii) provide immediate liquidity resources to restore essential \nservices  to  countries  affected  by  natural  disasters,  and  (iii)  assist  with  recovery  and \nreconstruction activities. The World Bank launched a subregional catastrophe insurance pilot \nscheme involving the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu in 2012. \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s contribution to the development of the regional catastrophe insurance scheme \nunder the PCRAFI included identifying and recording country-specific geographic information \nsystem datasets of buildings, major infrastructure, major crops, and population. About 80,000 \nbuildings and major infrastructure were physically inspected, and about 3 million buildings and \nother assets, mostly in rural areas, were inferred from satellite imagery. The PCRAFI also \ndeveloped the region\u2019s most comprehensive regional historical hazard catalog and historical \nloss database for major disasters, as well as country-specific hazard models that simulate \nearthquakes and tropical cyclones. The PCRAFI\u2019s outputs also include risk maps showing the \ngeographic distribution of potential losses for each Pacific DMC as well as other visualization \nproducts of the risk assessments. This information is stored in the Pacific Risk Information \nSystem (PacRIS) housed at the SPC and can be accessed through an open-source web-based \nplatform. \n \n6.  During the development of the PacRIS, it became apparent that this data has significant \nvalue  for  other  applications  beyond  disaster  risk  financing.  A  lack  of  climate  and  hazard \nexposure  information  has  constrained  progress  in  mainstreaming  climate  and  disaster  risk \nconsiderations  into  urban  and  infrastructure  development  planning,  which  is  critical  for \nsafeguarding social and economic development gains in the region. As a result, Pacific DMCs \nhave  tended  to  respond  to  the  symptoms  of  natural  disaster  events  through  relief  and \nreconstruction efforts, rather than dealing with the root causes through better development \nplanning. The PacRIS contains information on (i) the probability of hazard events occurring in a \nparticular location, (ii) the value and ownership of assets threatened by natural disasters and \nclimate change, and (iii) information about the likely impacts of such events, which is critical for \ndisaster and climate resilient development planning. \n \n7.  Catastrophe risk insurance outreach activities carried out to date as part of the PCRAFI \nhave primarily targeted Pacific DMC treasury and finance officials. As a result, there is limited \nawareness of PacRIS data and its value as a planning and risk-screening tool among other \nnational and municipal government agencies that are responsible for urban and sector planning \nas well as among development partners that support infrastructure investment activities in the \nregion. Pacific DMC officials also have limited capacity to analyze natural hazard and climate \nchange information and apply it to development planning. Awareness and capacity building \nactivities are therefore needed to enable Pacific DMCs and development partners to use this \ndata to develop climate and disaster resilient policies, plans, programs, and projects. \n \n8.  There  is  increasing  recognition  that  disaster  risk  reduction  and  climate  change \nadaptation share a common focus in reducing the vulnerability of communities and contributing \nto sustainable development. Many governments are recognizing the important role that disaster \nrisk  reduction  plays  in  reducing  the  adverse  impacts  of  climate  change.  This  includes \nacknowledging that reducing risks related to current weather and climate conditions is usually \nthe best way to prepare for addressing risks related to climate change. Systematic consideration \nand integration of disaster and climate risks as part of planning processes ensure the viability of \ninvestments to support the achievement of social and economic development objectives and \nensure that planned development activities do not increase the vulnerability of people and \nassets to such risks. \n \n ", "  3 \n9.  An effective integrated disaster risk management framework to protect development \ngains in Pacific DMCs combines ex ante investments in disaster risk reduction and climate \nchange adaptation with ex post disaster risk financing instruments to cope with residual risks \nfollowing  a  natural  disaster  event.  Moving forward,  the  PCRAFI  will  support  an  integrated \napproach to managing natural disasters in the region by reducing vulnerability to climate change \nand natural disaster risks through better development planning, and by supporting post-disaster \nrecovery through the proposed regional catastrophe insurance facility. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be that social and economic development in Pacific DMCs is resilient to \nclimate change and natural hazard events. The outcome will be that climate and disaster risk \ninformation is integrated into urban development and infrastructure planning in Pacific DMCs.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will have three outputs to support the achievement of the TA outcome.  \n \n12.  Output 1: Integrated climate and disaster risk assessment tools for planning are \noperational. Output 1 will demonstrate how physical asset and risk information can be adapted \nfor local planning purposes and how risk information can be integrated into the development of \nactual plans, policies, and programs to strengthen urban and infrastructure resilience to climate \nand disaster risks. The TA will assess natural disaster and climate change risks using the \nPacRIS and other climate change data and tools. Additionally, it will demonstrate the integration \nof such risk information in at least two urban development plans, resulting in the identification of \nproposed risk mitigation measures in the associated investment plans. Using case studies from \ntwo Pacific DMCs (to be identified and selected during implementation), a learning-by-doing \napproach will be adopted to develop a methodology for integrating disaster and climate risk \nassessment tools into development planning in Pacific DMCs.6 PacRIS tools may be expanded \nto target and support local risk-sensitive development planning. \n \n13.  Output 2: Integrated tools for mainstreaming disaster and climate risks into urban \nand sector planning are shared. The methodologies and findings from the two case studies \nwill be shared with a wide audience of regional stakeholders in a user manual that includes best \npractices and lessons. Output 2 is intended to promote the use of the PacRIS and other climate \nrisk data and tools so that disaster risk and climate change considerations form an integral part \nof urban development and infrastructure planning processes in Pacific DMCs. The user manual \nwill  be  produced  in  hard  copy  and  shared  with  Pacific  DMC  government  agencies, \nnongovernment organizations, academic institutions, and development partners. An electronic \nversion of the manual will also be available for download from the ADB and SPC websites, as \nwell as from Pacific Disaster Net, a regional disaster risk management information web portal. \nUrban  and  sector  information  sheets  on  risk-sensitive  development  planning  will  also  be \nproduced as part of the TA.  \n \n                                                \n6  Case study countries will be selected on the basis of (i) the existence of urban development plans, (ii) country \nvulnerability to natural hazards and climate change, and (iii) the availability of detailed climate change and natural \nhazard information for target urban zones.  \n ", "4 \n \n14.  Output 3: Pacific DMC planners apply newly acquired climate and disaster risk \nmainstreaming skills. Output 3 will focus on building capacity and raising awareness among \nPacific DMC planners responsible for disaster risk management and climate change adaptation \non the importance of natural disaster and climate sensitive development informed by tools \ndeveloped under the TA. These planners include central and line agencies such as national \nplanning and finance ministries, disaster management offices, urban planning agencies, utilities, \nnongovernment  organizations,  private  sector  representatives,  and  development  partners. \nTraining activities, using the user manual developed under output 2, will be carried out in each \nof the six participating Pacific DMCs,7 with the aim of (i) raising awareness of PCRAFI tools and \ndata,  including  their  practical  value  and  the  importance  of  maintaining  and  sharing  this \ninformation; (ii) building capacity among key Pacific DMC stakeholders to access, manipulate, \nand use PacRIS data to guide urban development and infrastructure planning; and (iii) building \nnational ownership of PacRIS products and tools. Women will be encouraged to participate in all \nof the training activities carried out under the TA. A series of awareness building activities will \nalso be carried out regionally to make Pacific DMCs not directly targeted under the TA aware of \nPacRIS tools and data and their value for urban development and infrastructure planning. \n \n15.  It is assumed that Pacific DMC policymakers, with sufficient information and capacity, \nwill proactively invest in natural disaster and climate change risk reduction. The main risk to the \nTA is that Pacific DMC policymakers do not enforce development controls or policies designed \nto reduce climate and disaster vulnerability. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $650,000 equivalent, which will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are presented in Appendix 2. The participating Pacific DMC governments will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation, remuneration and per diem for \nstaff, miscellaneous administration, and support costs and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the executing agency. The TA will be implemented over 24 months from \n2 January 2013 to 2 January 2015. The TA will be overseen by the PCRAFI steering committee \nconsisting of representatives from ADB, Japan International Cooperation Agency, the SPC, the \nUnited Nations Human Settlements Programme, and the World Bank. Activities will be carried \nout in coordination with stakeholders such as the Government of Australia\u2019s Department of \nClimate Change and Energy Efficiency, which is undertaking complementary activities in the \nregion  as  part  of  its  Pacific\u2013Australia  Climate  Change  Science  and  Adaptation  Planning \nProgram. \n \n18.  The TA will finance 33.25 person-months of international and national consulting inputs: \n(i) risk specialist\u2014team leader (international, 7 person-months); (ii) urban planner (international, \n4  person-months);  (iii)  civil  engineer  (international,  1  person-month);  (iv) economist \n(international,  2  person-months);  (v) expert  peer  review  inputs  (international,  1.25 person-\nmonths);  (vi)  disaster  risk  management  training  specialist  (international,  4  person-months); \n(vii) risk mapping specialist (international, 6 person-months); and (viii) two national coordinators \n(national, 4 person-months each). All consulting services will be rendered intermittently. \n \n                                                \n7  The six participating DMCs include Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu. \n ", "  5 \n19.  The risk specialist (team leader), urban planner, civil engineer, and economist will be \nrecruited through a firm using the consultant qualification selection method. The SPC will be \ncontracted  as  a  consulting  firm  using  the  single-source  selection  method  to  recruit  the \ninternational disaster risk management training specialist, international risk mapping specialist, \nand national coordinators in case study countries. The SPC has the regional mandate for the \nprovision of technical support and training to Pacific DMCs for disaster risk reduction and \ndisaster management and is also the regional custodian of the PacRIS database. The outline \nterms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  Consultant recruitment will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Procurement of equipment will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime).  All  equipment  will  be  turned  over  to  the  executing  agency  upon  completion  of  TA \nactivities.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n21.  Progress will be monitored against intended outcome and output indicators reflected in \nthe design and monitoring framework, and will involve preparing TA progress and completion \nreports. Implementation progress will also be discussed and reviewed during regular meetings \nof the PCRAFI steering committee. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $650,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Strengthening Disaster and Climate \nRisk Resilience in Urban Development in the Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms   Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nSocial and economic  Reduced loss of life and  PacRIS  Pacific DMCs with \ndevelopment in  assets from natural    sufficient information \nPacific DMCs is  disaster and climate  Pacific disaster  and capacity and \nresilient to climate  change-related  management office  support from \nchange and natural  events in Pacific DMCs in  damage assessment  development partners \nhazard events   2018 when compared to  reports  will be proactive in \nthe business-as-usual  investing in disaster \nscenario  risk reduction and \n  climate change \n  adaptation measures  \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nClimate and disaster  At least two Pacific DMCs  Pacific DMC sector plans  Required changes are \nrisk information is  develop and approve    made to national \nintegrated into urban  zoning regulations based  Pacific DMC project  planning and \ndevelopment and  on the application of risk  feasibility studies  investment \ninfrastructure  information by 2015    regulations  \nplanning in Pacific    Development partner   \nDMCs  reports \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

Disaster and climate risk mapping and assessment. Using PacRIS data, models and \nrisk maps, and existing climate risk information, the consultants will to assess climate and \ndisaster risks by mapping natural disaster events and climate change scenarios according to \nprobabilities of occurrence. The consultants will use scenario-based planning to examine a \ndiscrete set of disaster and climate scenarios that are most relevant for local urban and sector \ndevelopment  planning  in  the  case  study  countries.  Disaster  and  climate  impacts  will  be \nassessed over time in selected urban areas and sectors, including the risks associated with \nspecific land uses and assets in various locations. High risk areas, anticipated changes in \nimpacts  over time  resulting from climate  change,  projected  population growth,  and  human \nsettlement and economic development patterns will all be identified. Known uncertainties in the \nmodels and how these should be reflected in the development of recommendations for updating \nurban and sector policies, plans, and regulations will also be identified. \n \n11.  Development  framework.  In  consultation  with  stakeholders,  acceptable  levels  of \ndisaster and climate risk will be established to guide policies, standards, and development \npriorities. Based on identified risks, recommendations will be provided on how urban and sector \nplanning processes and plans can be strengthened to reflect these risks, including (i) types of \ndevelopment that should take place within various urban zones, including appropriate locations \nfor specific land uses; (ii) proposed requirements for disaster and climate risk assessment for all \nnew developments; (iii) minimum design standards for permitted development within designated \nzones; and (iv) proposed retrofitting measures for key infrastructure that is assessed as being \nhighly  vulnerable  to  climate  and  disaster  risks.  Based  on  these  recommendations,  the \nconsultants will propose modifications to existing urban development policies, land use plans \nand  associated  zoning  regulations,  building  codes,  and  infrastructure  design  standards, \n ", "  Appendix 3  11 \nincluding  how  proposed  measures  should  be  prioritized.  The  consultants  will  also  identify \nobstacles which may impede the strengthening of planning processes, such as customary \nownership of land located in urban areas. \n \n12.  Identification  of  disaster  and  climate-proofing  measures  for  selected  planned \nsector infrastructure investment. Based on climate and disaster risk assessments and levels \nof  acceptable  risk,  the  consultants  will  develop  possible  disaster  and  climate  resilience \nstrengthening  measures  to  be  considered  in  feasibility  studies  for  the  planned  sector \ninfrastructure  investments.  These  measures  include  the  siting  of  infrastructure  and  the \nincorporation  of  climate-proofing  measures  into  infrastructure  engineering  designs  and \nmaintenance requirements to promote the sustainability of sector investments. \n \n13.  Economic analysis of proposed measures to build disaster and climate change \nresilience. An economic analysis of proposed measures to build resilience to natural disaster \nand climate change-related events will be conducted. The economic analysis  will examine \npriority disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation measures for urban planning, \nsector development, and infrastructure investments proposed in the two case study countries. \nUsing the PacRIS and existing climate change data, the economist will compare \u2015with disaster \nrisk reduction and climate change adaptation\u2016 and \u2015without disaster risk reduction and climate \nchange adaptation\u2016 situations to estimate the benefits of proposed interventions. The economist, \nin consultation with other consultant team members, will also estimate the proposed costs of \nvarious disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation investments. Where costs and \nbenefits associated with investments can be estimated with relative certainty and quantified in \nmonetary terms, the economic internal rate of return will be calculated. A sensitivity analysis will \nalso be carried out to test the robustness of the results of the economic analysis. Proposed \ndisaster  risk  reduction  and  climate  change  adaptation  measures  will  be  prioritized,  where \nfeasible, based on the results of the economic analysis.  \n \n14.  Presentation of findings to stakeholders. The consultants will present draft findings, \nincluding results of the climate and disaster risk assessments and recommendations, to in-\ncountry  stakeholders,  government  and  nongovernment  representatives,  and  development \npartners.  Based  on  the  feedback  received  during  consultations,  recommendations  will  be \nrevised and expanded on, as needed. \n \n3.  Development of Disaster and Climate Risk Screening Training Manual \n15.  Based on pilot testing as part of selected Pacific DMC case studies, the proposed \nmethodology for integrating disaster and climate risks into urban and sector planning processes \nand investment projects will be updated, taking into consideration specific Pacific DMC contexts \nsuch as data quality, institutional capacity, and regulatory environments. \n \n16.  Case study summaries will be included in the training manual containing best practices \nand lessons in the development of country case studies. \n \n4.  Awareness and Training Activities \n17.  Following the completion of country case studies, SPC will organize a training activity in \neach of the six participating countries to (i) build national capacity to access the PacRIS and \nexisting climate change data; (ii) apply risk information to planning processes; and (iii) share the \nfindings from the case studies. The national training activities will target a wide range of country \npolicy  makers,  including  representatives  from  central  and  line  agencies,  urban  and  local \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \n \n \ncouncils, utilities, nongovernment organizations, the private sector, and development partners. \nThe consultants will provide assistance with the design and delivery of training activities. \n \n18.  The consultants will participate in selected regional climate and disaster events to raise \nawareness among a wide range of Pacific DMC policymakers, nongovernment representatives, \nand development partners on the existence and practical use of PacRIS data and tools, and \nhow these can be used to support disaster and climate resilient development planning.  \n \n19.  A total of four international consultants over a 24-month period are required for a total of \n14  person-months  of  input,  to  be  recruited  through  a  consulting  firm.  The  international \nconsultants will include (i) a risk specialist\u2014team leader (7 person-months, intermittent); (ii) an \nurban planner (4 person-months, intermittent); (iii) a civil engineer (1person-month, intermittent); \nand (iv) an economist (2. person-months, intermittent). \n \nB.  Secretariat of the Pacific Community  \n \n20.  Two international and two national consultants will be engaged over a 24-month period, \nfor a total of 18 person-months of input from SPC.  \n \n21.  Disaster  risk  management  training  specialist  (international,  4  person-months, \nintermittent). The specialist will work with the risk specialist (team leader) in the design and \ndelivery of capacity building activities. The specialist will develop training activities under the TA \nthat address identified capacity gaps among urban and sector planners in Pacific DMCs. SPC \nwill organize training activities in each of the six participating DMC countries. \n \n22.  The specialist will prepare a draft training plan, to be included in the draft inception \nreport, for capacity building activities carried out as part of the TA. The design of the training \nactivities will draw on best practices and lessons from SPC\u2019s experiences in building capacity in \nthe region. The training schedule, where feasible, will be coordinated with related training \nactivities delivered by SPC and other development partners in the six participating countries. \n \n23.  The specialist will provide input into the development of the training manual developed \nunder the TA and ensure that it is written in a clear manner and style appropriate for Pacific \nDMC urban and sector planners.  \n   \n24.  Following the development of country case studies and the draft training manual, the \nspecialist  will  be  work  with  the  team  leader  to  organize  a  training  activity  in  each  of  the \nparticipating  countries,  build  national  capacity  to  access  the  PacRIS  and  existing  climate \nchange  data,  and  apply  risk  information  to  planning  processes.  The  results  and \nrecommendations  of  the  draft  case  studies  will  be  presented  to  participants.  The  national \ntraining will target a wide range of country policy makers involved in development planning, \nincluding representatives from central and line agencies, urban and local councils, utilities, \nnongovernment organizations, and the private sector.  \n \n25.  The specialist will participate in selected regional climate and disaster events to raise \nawareness among a wide range of Pacific DMC policymakers, nongovernment representatives, \nand development partners on the existence and practical use of PacRIS data and tools and how \nthese can be used to support improved development planning.  \n \n26.  Risk mapping specialist (international, 6 person-months, intermittent). The specialist \nwill facilitate the team leader\u2019s access to the PacRIS data platform and other data housed at \n ", "  Appendix 3  13 \nSPC and will provide input into the development of a methodology for using risk information to \nincorporate  climate  and  disaster  resilience  into  development  planning for  the  two  selected \nPacific DMC case studies. \n \n27.  To assess climate and natural disaster risks for the selected case studies, the specialist \nwill  produce  scenario-based  risk  maps  for  the  selected  urban  and  geographic  areas  that \nillustrate assets as areas at risk from natural disasters of various magnitudes. These risk maps \nwill also project climate change impacts based on available risk information contained in the \nPacRIS, existing climate change models, and other data sources.  \n \n28.  National coordinators (two persons, national, 4 person-months each, intermittent). The \ncoordinators will provide logistical and coordination support for consultant team members. The \ncoordinators should have strong in-country networks in the disaster management and/or urban \nand  sector  planning  communities  to  be  able  to  facilitate  meetings  with  government  and \nnongovernment officials. The coordinators will also provide any logistical support required to \ncarry out case studies, including making arrangements for fieldwork. The coordinators will assist \nwith  organizing  all  in-country  capacity  building  and  training  activities  and  stakeholder \nconsultations. \n \nC.  Peer Review  \n \n29.  Expert peer review inputs (international, 1.25 person-months, intermittent). The peer \nreview team will consist of recognized experts in the field of disaster and climate resilient \ndevelopment planning. The experts will review draft outputs produced under the TA to ensure \nthat they meet required quality standards. The objective of the peer review is to provide an in-\ndepth  assessment  of  the  assumptions,  calculations,  extrapolations,  methodology,  and \nconclusions  pertaining  to  the  climate  and  disaster  risk  and  vulnerability  assessments. \nAdditionally, the review should assess proposed measures to build resilience against identified \nrisks in urban, sector, and infrastructure planning and projects in Pacific DMCs. It is intended to \nidentify any errors or omissions that might affect the credibility of the work carried out in case \nstudy countries under the TA, which is intended as a model that will be scaled up and replicated \nacross the region. As part of the peer review, it is expected that a documented review of the \nwork will be completed following the completion of the draft case studies and draft training \nmanual to demonstrate to  stakeholders that activities  meet the specific needs of intended \nbeneficiaries and are technically adequate, competently performed, and properly documented. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20121205155448Z", "Creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007", "Keywords": "climate change, disaster prevention, disaster management, climate resilience, floods, droughts, cyclones, earthquakes, tsunami, urban development planning, adb projects, infrastructure planning, 46162, adb technical assistance, cdta/rdta/pata/ppta", "ModDate": "D:20121210163605+08'00'", "Producer": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007", "Title": ""}}
