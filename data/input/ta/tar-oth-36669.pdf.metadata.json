The Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), on behalf of its governing body the Forum Fisheries \nCommittee,  approached  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  2002  for  assistance  in \nformulating alternative license fee arrangements in light of the Convention on the Conservation \nand Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean \nadopted on 5 September 2000 (the CMFS Convention). The concept paper was included in \nPacific Department's regional technical assistance (TA) plan for 2003.1 The TA framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \n2.  The tuna fishery in the western and central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) is the largest and one \nof the most productive in the world, with an average annual catch fluctuating around 1.8 million \nmetric tons (t) during 1996\u20132000.  The catch had an annual average monetary value of nearly \n$2  billion.  Annual  revenue2  from  license  fees  flowing  to  FFA's  member  countries3  is \napproximately $60.3 million and increasing this revenue from licensing is a high priority for FFA \nmember countries.  \n \n3.  The declaration of exclusive economic zones (EEZs) from the 1970s on, sanctioned \nunder the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, enabled FFA member \ncountries to introduce fishing access agreements with the distant water fishing nations (DWFNs) \nand license fees were approximately 4% of the landed value of the catch. This return has since \nincreased to 5\u20136%4 but comparisons with other license agreements outside the Pacific region \nsuggest that revenues may be increased.5 \n \n4.  The adoption of the CMFS Convention (Appendix 2) envisages the introduction of \nspecific  fish  quota  allocations  to  the  Pacific  island  states  and  the  DWFNs.  FFA  member \ncountries need to prepare for these changes while continuing to receive the benefits from their \ntuna resources. The current access arrangements and agreements only address the maximum \nnumber of purse seiners,6 but offer no mechanisms to deal with actual catch allocations or the \npotential to increase license fees by creating competition for licenses and/or facilitating changes \nto the current licensing arrangements. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Tuna catches from the WCPO represent approximately a third of the world\u2019s total landed \ncatch.  The  benefits  generated  by  the  tuna  fishery  in  the  WCPO  offer  for  many  Pacific \ndeveloping member countries (PDMCs)7 one of the few avenues to prevent continued economic \nstagnation. The present catch levels of the Pacific tuna fishery are considered sustainable and \nthe stocks of the main four commercial tuna species are in a healthy state, although there have \n                                                 \n1   The Project first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 31 July 2003. \n2   ADB. 2001. Tuna: A Key Economic Resource in the Pacific. Pacific Studies Series.  Manila \n3  The 17 members of FFA are: Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of \nMicronesia, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, \nTuvalu and Vanuatu.  \n4   $60.3 million corresponds to around 3% of the value. The discrepancy between this figure and the average of 5% \nobtained in license fees stems from domestically-based seiners that pay less, and the catches taken outside the \nEEZs. \n5  The European Union fleet off West Africa for example pays 8-9% in license fees, but subsidies could be part of this.   \n6  Purse seining targets surface skipjack using huge encircling nets, which are then closed in the bottom (purse)    \nbefore the catch is taken onboard. \n7  Includes Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New \nGuinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. ", "2  \nbeen some concerns over the status of the bigeye and yellowfin stocks. However, the long-term \ncatch trends and the length-frequency data (a measure of the extent of overfishing) of the main \ncommercial tuna species need to be documented as underpinning evidence of an existing \nsustainable fishery and therefore strengthened bargaining power in future access negotiations.  \n \n6.  DWFN fleets dominate the commercial tuna fishery in the WCPO. In general, access to \nthe EEZs for foreign fishing vessels has been provided through bilateral arrangements between \nthe  PDMCs  and  the  governments,  fishing  associations,  or  individual  companies  from  the \nDWFNs. Only one multilateral arrangement, a United States Fisheries Multilateral Fisheries \nTreaty with certain Pacific island countries in 1987 (US treaty), has been concluded, but efforts \nto conclude similar arrangements with Japan, the Republic of Korea, Taipei,China, and the \nEuropean Union, have not been successful. However, a more recent trend in some PDMCs with \nlarge and year-round tuna resources has been to issue long-term access agreements against \nDWFN investment in onshore fish processing facilities. The economic benefits in the form of \nemployment and economic growth can be substantial and the implications of this development \ntrend should be evaluated. With the uneven distribution of the tuna resources in the Pacific \nocean, the better endowed countries are unlikely to agree to share their revenue with the less \nendowed\u2014as is the case with the US treaty. \n \n7.  The  adoption  of  the  CMFS  Convention  envisages  the  establishment  of  effective \nmanagement regimes by Pacific island states and introduces new elements into the tuna \nfishery. Sustainability of the fishery is the goal and various measures will be applied to ensure \ntuna conservation. This new development appears to offer opportunities for Pacific island \ncountries to increase their benefits from their tuna resources as total allowable catch quotas are \nlikely to increase the value of access.  \n \n8.  The Palau Arrangement8 dated October 1992 specifies a limit of 205 purse seiners to \noperate in the WCPO. Five DWFNs were originally allocated a specific number of vessels each \nand a certain number of vessels were earmarked for the Pacific island states. In the last few \nyears, the Palau Arrangement has been under pressure due to an increase in the number of \nvessels  and  new  entrants  seeking  licenses,  and  has  only  held  together  using  short-term \nsolutions taking advantage of the fact that the number of United States vessels  is below the \nallocated ceiling. \n \n9.  Despite a long history of licensing foreign tuna fishing vessels, the balance of power \nwhen negotiating access with the fishing states has not typically favored the Pacific island \nstates. The PDMCs have, for some time, recognized the disparity between the fees that they \nnegotiate  and  the  reported  value  of  the  fishery,  but  have  been  hampered  in  negotiating \nincreased returns by a number of constraints. The constraints include general institutional \nweaknesses, secrecy and  nontransparency in the negotiations, the economic and political \npower of the DWFNs, competition among Pacific island countries, and data and surveillance \nshortfalls. The latter is being rectified, with the agreement that all fishing vessels are to carry \ntracking devices. \n \n10.  A range of approaches has been used for calculating and negotiating license fees, \ntypically targeted at recovering approximately between 5\u20136% of the landed value of the catch, \nbut often associated with aid assistance of various forms, which makes the \"raw\" license fee \nsomewhat difficult to calculate. The limited capacity of Pacific island states to verify reported \n                                                 \n8   Parties to the Palau Arrangement comprise Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, and         \nPapua New Guinea. ", "  3\ncatches by surveillance mechanisms or by comparative analysis of landed catches against \nreported log sheets, also makes the current calculation of revenues and fees difficult. Pacific \nisland states have in general maintained an ethic of regional cohesiveness on issues where \nthere are clear collective benefits like the US treaty, and on a number of subregional fisheries \nmanagement arrangements. However, details concerning bilateral negotiations and agreements \ntend not to be available between Pacific island states and are in general being kept secret, \nusing \u201ccommercial confidentiality\u201d as the excuse. This lack of shared information contributes \ntoward reduced negotiating power as the individual governments have no mechanism for \nevaluating if the license fees negotiated are fair in comparison with other countries in the region. \nTo eliminate the opportunity for DWFNs to negotiate license fees inequitably among PDMCs, \ntransparent mechanisms for licensing  must be promoted across the region. Transparency and \ngood governance serve to reduce and deter the temptation to employ corrupt practices during \nnegotiations. \n \n11.  The nature of foreign fishing access arrangements has changed very little during the last \n10 years.  Thus, the adoption of the CMFS Convention, with its introduction of total allowable \ncatches, provides a timely and good opportunity to review the various arrangements and look at \noptions for Pacific island states to increase the benefits that they can generate from their tuna \nresources.  Alternatives  to  the  traditional  license  arrangements\u2014including,  e.g.,  the  use  of \ncharters and rights based management\u2014should be options available for the PDMCs once the \ncommission for the CMFS Convention begins its work in earnest. \n   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The purpose of the TA is to increase the returns from fishing license agreements to FFA \nmember countries. The output is the formulation of possible alternative license arrangements, to \nposition the FFA member countries with options for increasing the revenues from license fees in \nlight of the pending introduction of a total allowable catch regime. Given the differences between \nmany PDMCs, notably the uneven and fluctuating distribution of the tuna stocks, investment \npolicies, and infrastructure, the alternative arrangements will likely have different applicability for \nthe different PDMC groupings. FFA member representatives, from departments of fisheries and \nministries of finance, will be presented with the output at a workshop for discussion and \nendorsement. The endorsed version will be presented to the Forum Fisheries Committee for its \napproval for presentation to the Pacific Islands Forum and later submitted to the annual Forum \nLeaders meeting in August 2004. The findings will be published in ADB\u2019s Pacific Studies Series \nfor wide distribution in the region and beyond. \n \n13.  The output should facilitate more harmonized and transparent license negotiations to \nhelp the FFA member countries extract the maximum revenue from their resources. As the \nvalue of a fishery ultimately hinges upon the sustainability of the catches, a supporting output \nwill  be  to  convincingly  demonstrate  whether  the  various  tuna  fish  stocks  are  being \noverexploited. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will analyze catch and length-frequency data for the last 15 years of the four \nmain commercial tuna fish species caught in the WCPO. The data will be provided from the \ndatabase at the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) in Noumea. An international \nconsultant will translate the data into a write-up in lay person's language verifying whether the ", "4  \ntuna catch levels in the WCPO are sustainable. The TA will also (i) document the existing \naccess  agreements  and  license  arrangements  (government-to-government,  government-to-\nindustry, and government-to-company) and the current levels of returns to the FFA member \ncountries, including the direct and indirect costs and benefits from these access arrangements; \nand (ii) formulate a discussion paper identifying alternative methods and arrangements to \nnegotiate license fees arrangements, based on the expected higher attractiveness for access in \na  total  allowable  catch  regime  and  taking  into  consideration  subregional  comparative \nadvantages.  \n \n15.  PDMCs  will  be  visited  for  in-depth  verification  of  data  from  member  countries. \nDiscussions with selected representatives from  the DWFNs will be undertaken to gauge the \nfeasibility of and interest in alternative license agreements. A draft final report will be circulated \nto the relevant departments in all FFA member countries for comments prior to the workshop to \nfinalize and endorse the report\u2019s recommendations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $372,000 equivalent (detailed cost estimates are \nin Appendix 3). ADB has been requested to finance the costs of international consultants \n(remuneration, per diem, and travel), data collection, reporting, publication, and participation of \nFFA member country officials in the regional workshop at a total cost of $300,000. FFA will \nfinance the remaining $72,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding \nprogram. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  FFA will be the Executing Agency for the TA. FFA\u2019s mission is \u201cto enable members to \nmanage, conserve, and use the tuna resources in their EEZs and beyond, through enhancing \nnational capacity and strengthening regional solidarity.\u201d9 The agency is involved in regional \nfisheries management activities and providing its services to its members at the national level \non a request basis. The director of FFA will have overall responsibility for the  TA but the \npractical implementation will be vested with the manager of the Economic and Marketing \nDivision, who will be the TA leader. The division will submit quarterly progress reports to ADB. \nThe director of the Marine Resources Division at SPC will be the focal point for providing the \nstatistical data. \n \n18.  The TA is expected to begin in November 2003 and be concluded not later than the \nscheduled Pacific Islands Forum meeting in August 2004.   \n \n19.  FFA will receive an advance of up to $60,000 for undertaking all arrangements in \nconnection with the regional workshop, and will be responsible for paying for participants\u2019 travel, \nper diem, and accommodation, and for workshop proceedings, etc.10 All advances will be \nliquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines. FFA is uniquely positioned to undertake this \nrole as it has implemented two previous TAs.11 \n \n                                                 \n9  FFA\u2019s mission statement. \n10 FFA will submit a detailed cost estimate for ADB approval as the basis for any advances. \n11 ADB. 1993.

Three individual ni ternational consultants will be recruited, in (i) \nfisheries management and licensing (team leader), (ii) fisheries agreements, and (iii) scientific \nediting. The consultants will serve for a total of 7 person-months, and 2 person-months are \nunallocated due to the inherent uncertainty within the fisheries sector of information and statistic \navailability. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants. The team leader will be required to work part-time at SPC's and FFA's \nheadquarters. (Outline terms of reference are provided in Appendix 4.)  \n \n21.  The recommendations of the report will be disseminated to all concerned parties of the \nFFA member countries. In addition, the final report, including the sustainability aspects of the \ntuna resources in the WCPO, will be published in ADB's  Pacific Studies Series for wide \ndistribution according to the Pacific Department's mailing list.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis for \nAlternative Negotiating Arrangements to Increase Fisheries Revenues in the Pacific, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.

The Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks  \nin the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (the CMFS Convention) was adopted in Honolulu on \n5 September 2000.  It is one of the first regional fisheries agreements to be adopted since the \nconclusion in 1990 of the agreement for the implementation of the provisions of the United \nNations  Convention  on  the  Law  of  the  Sea  of  10  December  1982  (the  Law  of  the  Sea \nConvention), relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and high \nmigratory fish stocks. \n \n2.  The objective of the CMFS Convention is to ensure, through effective management, the \nlong-terms conservation and sustainable use of highly migratory fish stocks in the western and \ncentral Pacific Ocean, in accordance with the Law of the Sea Convention and the 1995 \nAgreement.  For  this  purpose,  the  CMFS  Convention  establishes  the  Commission  for  the \nConservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central \nPacific  Ocean  (the  Commission).  The  contracting  parties  to  the  CMFS  Convention  are, \nautomatically, members of the Commission.  \n \n3.  The CMFS Convention applies to all species of highly migratory fish stocks (defined as \nall fish stocks of the species listed in Annex I of the Law of the Sea Convention occurring in the \nCMFS Convention area and such other species of fish as the Commission may determine) \nwithin the CMFS Convention area, except sauries. Conservation and management measures \nunder the CMFS Convention are to be applied throughout the range of the stocks, or to specific \nareas within the CMFS Convention area, as determined by the Commission.  The CMFS \nConvention area is defined in article 3 of the CMFS Convention.   \n \n4.  The CMFS Convention was open for signature for 12 months from 5 September 2000 by \nthe states that participated in the Multilateral High-Level Conference on the Conservation and \nManagement of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific: Australia; \nCanada; The People\u2019s Republic of China; Cook Islands; Fiji Islands; France; Indonesia; Japan; \nKiribati;  Republic  of  Korea;  Marshall  Islands;  Federated  States  of  Micronesia;  Nauru;  New \nZealand;  Niue;  Palau; Papua New Guinea; Philippines; Samoa; Solomon Islands;  Tonga; \nTuvalu; United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie, \nand Oeno Islands; United States; and Vanuatu. The depositary for the CMFS Convention is the \nGovernment of New Zealand.  As of September 2002, the Convention had been signed by 19 \nStates:  Australia, Canada, Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Indonesia, Marshall Islands, Federated \nStates  of  Micronesia,  New  Zealand,  Nauru,  Niue,  Palau,  Papua  New  Guinea,  Philippines, \nSamoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, United States, and Vanuatu. Four States, (Fiji Islands, \nMarshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, and Samoa) had ratified the CMFS Convention. \n \n5.  In accordance with article 36, the CMFS Convention will enter into force 30 days after \nthe deposit of instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval, or accession by three states \nnorth of the 200 parallel of north latitude and seven states south of the 200 parallel of north \nlatitude.  However, if, within 3 years of its adoption (i.e., by September 2003), the CMFS \nConvention has not been ratified by three states north of the 200 parallel of north latitude, it will \nnevertheless  enter  into  force  6  months  after  the  deposit  of  the  thirteenth  instrument of \nratification, acceptance, approval, or accession. \n \n6.  After entry into force, the contracting parties may, by consensus, invite other States and \nregional economic integration organizations that wish to fish for high migratory fish stocks in the \nCMFS Convention area to accede to the CMFS Convention. ", "    Appendix 2  9\n \n7.  The CMFS Convention also contains special arrangements for participation by fishing \nentities  and  by  territories  within  the  CMFS  Convention  area.    On  5  September  2000, \nTaipei,China signed the Arrangement for the Participation of Fishing Entities. \n \n8.  Simultaneously  with  the  adoption  of  the  CMFS  Convention,  the  participants  in  the \nMultilateral  High-Level  Conference  also  adopted  a  resolution  establishing  the  Preparatory \nConference for the Establishment of the Commission for the Conservation and Management of \nHighly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean.  The task of the \npreparatory conference, which will continue until the CMFS Convention enters into force, is to \nlay the groundwork for the establishment of the commission and to ensure that no vacuum \nexists  between adoption of the CMFS Convention and its entry into force.  Specifically the \npreparatory  commission  and  its  subsidiary  bodies  will  facilitate  the  future  work  of  the \nCommission and the process of collecting and analyzing data on the status of the fish stocks \nand, if necessary, recommend conservation and management measures. \n \nA.  Secretariat of the Pacific Community \n \n9.  The Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), in Noumea, is the premier regional \ntechnical and development organization of the Pacific.
