INTRODUCTION \n1.  Guided by Strategy 2020,1 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) focuses on three critical \nstrategic  agendas\u2014inclusive  economic  growth,  environmentally  sustainable  growth,  and \nregional integration\u2014to serve as a partner and agent for change in Asia and the Pacific. ADB \nhas expanded its role as a knowledge bank, providing more advice to its member countries on \ncritical economic issues and policies. \n \n2.  ADB  has  the  unique  ability  to  contribute  and  apply  development  knowledge  in \ndeveloping Asia because it is centrally positioned to identify trends within and across the region. \nIt provides firsthand insights and analyses of economic developments and prospects, as well as \nan impartial institutional outlook that goes beyond individual countries. However, ADB\u2019s capacity \nto produce macroeconomic projections remains limited. It still relies on economic projections \nbased on models developed by other institutions including the International Monetary Fund and \nOxford Economics, consensus forecasts by Consensus Economics, and government estimates. \nWith the remarkable progress in the development of economic assessment tools particularly \nsince mid-1990s, it is time for ADB to improve its tools for short- to medium-term projections and \npolicy evaluations. This research and development technical assistance (TA)2 will provide ADB \nwith the capacity and proper tools to help developing Asian countries and their economic \nauthorities better understand the business cycles of their national and regional economies, and \nfacilitate strategic decision making that affects a wide range of economic policies.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  ADB\u2019s Economics and Research Department (ERD) releases its economic outlook for \ndeveloping  member  countries  (DMCs)  in  Asia  and the  Pacific  twice  annually  in  the  Asian \nDevelopment Outlook (ADO) report and its update. The ADO provides projections for important \nmacroeconomic  variables  such  as  gross  domestic  product,  inflation,  and  current  account \nbalance for the following 2 years. These projections currently are provided by ADB\u2019s regional \ndepartments, except for the projections for Hong Kong, China; Republic of Korea; Singapore; \nand Taipei,China, which are done by ERD. While ADB has strived to enhance its capacity to \nproduce  forecasts,  its  ability  to  conduct  policy  analyses  and  produce  macroeconomic \nprojections remains limited and varies across departments. \n \n4.  ERD has taken a series of initiatives since early 2000s to strengthen ADB\u2019s forecasting \ncapacity. These include subscribing to the Global Economic Model of Oxford Economics in 2002, \nwhich  ERD  has  routinely  used  to  produce  baseline  assumptions  for  major  industrialized \neconomies and to cross-check some of the DMCs\u2019 projections in the ADO and its update. \nAnother initiative is the Regional Economic Outlook Task Force. It was established in late 2008 \nto improve communication between ERD and the staff members of regional departments in \ncharge of ADO chapters. During task force meetings, regular discussions on important events \noccurring within and outside Asia and the Pacific helped facilitate better assessments of the \neconomic  conditions  of  each  DMC.  In  addition  to  these  ERD  initiatives,  some  regional \ndepartments also initiated macroeconomic modeling exercises for the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina and Pakistan to improve their understanding of the economy and the projections made. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. www.adb.org/strategy2020/ \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 August 2011.  \n ", "2   \n5.  Despite these initiatives, ADB still needs to improve its tools for short- to medium-term \nprojections  and  policy  evaluations.  Since  2006,  three  technical  notes3 that  evaluated  the \nforecasting performance of the ADO identified the need to improve the methods used by ADB. A \ntechnical note in 2009, which reviewed economic assessment tools in general and past and \npresent practices at ADB, also highlighted the need to construct forecasting models that are \ndesigned or based on the economic peculiarities of each DMC.4 In addition to these limitations, \nthe Global Economic Model of Oxford Economics used by ERD only provides forecasts for 10 \nDMCs.  \n \n6.  Strengthening ADB\u2019s economic assessment capacity is essential to improving the quality \nof ADB\u2019s flagship publication (the ADO and its update) and policy analyses. It will also improve \nthe inputs provided to other important ADB publications, such as the Asia Economic Monitor \n(two editions annually) and the Pacific Economic Monitor (three editions annually). Since the \nADO  was first  published  in  1989, government  officials,  development partners,  economists, \nacademics,  think  tanks,  private  sector  entities,  and  the  media  have  grown  increasingly \ninterested in the publication. Because of the continued robust growth in Asia and the Pacific, \nADB\u2019s views on the economic outlook, policy challenges, and development challenges in the \nregion  are  increasingly  cited  and  scrutinized.  Creating  tools  for  short-  to  medium-term \nprojections and policy evaluations will greatly contribute to ADB's research. \n \n7.  If  ADB\u2019s  economic  assessment  tools  are  designed  or  based  on  the  economic \npeculiarities of each DMC, the ADO\u2019s importance to Asian policy makers will be enhanced. \nExisting work by international agencies and other ADB departments will be extended or used \nextensively as a guide in designing such tools. The resulting tool set will directly complement \nthe existing tools and help countries improve their understanding of the factors affecting Asia\u2019s \nshort- to medium-term economic prospects. It will also help elevate the public\u2019s perception of \nADB as a prime knowledge bank within and outside developing Asia. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of this TA will be the provision of more effective policy advice based on \nenhanced economic assessment tools and tailor-made projections for developing Asia, which \nwill influence the intellectual environment in which policy formulation occurs and promote ADB \nas an authoritative and independent source of knowledge about the region. The impact can be \nmeasured by an evaluation of whether economic policies and development strategies adopted \nby ADB's DMCs are consistent with what the results of this study indicate. \n \n9.  The  outcome  of  this  TA  will  be  robust  economic  assessment  tools  and  better \nunderstanding of the short- to medium-term key macroeconomic components of the regional \neconomy to facilitate strategic decisions that affect a wide range of economic policies.  \n \n10.  The main outputs of this TA are forecasting tools for gross domestic product and inflation \nfor developing countries in Asia and the Pacific.  \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2006.

The TA will have two components that aim to build economic assessment capacity and \ndevelop new tools that can cater to the peculiarities of economies in Asia and the Pacific. Under \nthe first component, technical workshops on economic assessment capacity building will be \norganized. This component will focus on capacity building of regional and country offices in \ncharge of preparing macroeconomic assessments and projections for the ADO as well as other \nrelevant officials in the region. Two technical workshops will aim to introduce tools that can be \nused to conduct economic assessments and generate projections. These include easy-to-use \nmodeling tools based on Microsoft Excel and dynamic stochastic general equilibrium modeling. \nThese complementary tools will help with diagnostic analyses of macroeconomic performance \nand of the effects of macroeconomic and structural policies on the main variables of interest to \npolicymakers, including output, prices, and the balance of payments.  \n12.  Under  the  second  component,  studies  will  generate  (i)  a  multicountry  economic \nassessment tool that will serve as a framework to check consistency across projections for ADB \nmember countries and global assumptions, and (ii) two tools for projections and policy analyses \nfor low- and middle-income country groups in the region.5 One additional workshop is planned \nunder the TA, in which consultants, ADB staff, and other experts will discuss and present the \neconomic assessment tools they generated as part of the second component. \n13.  The objective of the TA is to improve stakeholders\u2019 understanding of which development \nstrategies and policies are most effective in minimizing extreme business cycle fluctuations and \nachieving  inclusive  and  sustained  economic  growth.  Options  for  alternative  development \nstrategies and policies will be made available to policy makers and practitioners, which will allow \nthem to assess which alternative development strategies would be relevant for their economies. \nThe study will provide strategies for national development as well as for regional cooperation \nand integration.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $650,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The financing will cover the \nremuneration, per diem, and travel expenses of international consultants, as well as the travel \nexpenses  of  ADB  team  members  who  will  act  as  resource  persons,  travel  expenses  of \nconference  and  workshop  resource  persons,  report  production,  and  other  miscellaneous \nexpenses. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency;  ERD\u2019s  Macroeconomics  and  Finance  Research \nDivision, in close coordination with regional departments, will be the implementing agency. The \nTA will build on the inputs of the consultants hired for this project and ADB team members, \nincluding those in regional departments. Counterpart institutions will not play a substantive role \nexcept in workshops and other forums where collaboration with DMC governments and other \nstakeholders, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, will be sought \neither in the form of input or participation. The TA will be implemented over 20 months from \n                                                \n5 The selection of economies that belong to low- and middle-income country groups will be determined in consultation \nwith the Office of Regional Economic Integration and other relevant departments in ADB. \n ", "4   \nDecember 2011 to June 2013.6 The projections and policy analyses generated from this TA \ncould be used as inputs for ADB's future research, including the ADO and its update.   \n \n16.  The TA will require 5 person-months of international consulting. One lead consultant (an \neconomist)  will  be  hired  for  1  person-month  to  coordinate  the  technical  aspects  from \nconceptualization of the projection to evaluation of the economic assessments. Four consultants \n(economists)  will  be  hired  for  1  person-month  each  to  conceptualize,  design,  and  build \neconomic assessment tools. A national consultant will be hired for 12 person-months to help \nwith the logistics and organizational matters, and to provide research assistance.  \n \n17.  ADB will hire the consultants individually in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. Disbursements under the project will follow ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will use \nexisting software (e.g., Stata 11) and databases (e.g., CEIC Database, Bloomberg), but will also \npurchase other essential software (e.g., Matlab, scientific workplace) and computer equipment. \nThese purchases will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as \namended from time to time) and in coordination with ADB\u2019s Office of Information Systems and \nTechnology and Office of Administrative Services, where applicable. The equipment purchased \nunder the TA will be turned over to ADB upon completion of the project. \n \n18.  The expected outputs and outcome evaluation will be disseminated in conferences and \nworkshops where the consultants will present their economic assessment tools. These events \nand related follow-up discussions will provide opportunities for exchanges between TA research \nstaff,  consultants,  and  local  stakeholders.  Participation  of  regional  departments  and  DMC \nofficials will be emphasized and expected in the two technical workshops, which will allow them \nto benefit from the TA. The concluding conference will serve as a broader platform for dialogue \nand evaluation of the TA. Other dissemination activities, including publication of the edited \noutput and media exposure if necessary, will be conducted in cooperation with the Department \nof External Relations. The outcome evaluation will be gathered by soliciting comments on \ndesigned economic assessment tools from international and local experts, if possible from other \nresearch  and  academic  institutions.  A  peer  review  within  ADB  to  assess  the  quality  and \napplicability of the tools will also be sought.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $650,000 on a grant basis for \nStrengthening Economic Assessment Capacity for Asia and the Pacific Region, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n6  ADB-financed activities will not commence in any participating country unless a no objection to proceed is received \nfrom that country. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact      Risks \nMore effective policy  Adoption of policy  Government reports   \nadvice based on  recommendations by ADB    Economic or other \nenhanced economic  DMCs  Policy pronouncements  shocks that derail \nassessment tools and    baseline assumptions, \ntailor-made projections  analysis, and \n   \nfor developing countries  projections, undermining \nin Asia and the Pacific      its use in policy \n  dialogues  \nInfluence on the   \nintellectual environment  Ineffective \nin which policy  implementation of reform \nformulation occurs and  measures \npromotion of ADB as an   \nauthoritative and   \nindependent source of \nknowledge about the \nregion \nOutcome      Assumption \nStronger economic  Participation of experts in  Exchange  of  ideas  by   \nassessment capacity of  the workshops  participants  Relevant feedback from \nDMC officials and    workshop participants \nrelevant ADB staff, and  Peer review of content   \nbetter understanding of \n   \nthe short- to medium-\nterm key     \nmacroeconomic \ncomponents of the \nregional economy to \nfacilitate strategic \ndecisions that affect a \nwide range of economic \npolicies \n \nOutputs      Assumption \nThe main activities of  Quality economic  Consultants reports   \nthe TA can be divided  assessment tools    Research outputs \ninto two components: (i)  introduced  according to the terms of \ntwo technical    reference \nworkshops to   \n   \nstrengthen economic  Risk \nassessment capacity,       \nand (ii) development of  Unforeseen \ntools for economic  circumstances that can \nassessment and one  compromise the \nworkshop.
