THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 3 of the Facilitating Youth School-\nto-Work Transition Program. \n \n2.  The program will enhance the employability of youth1 by shortening the school-to-work \ntransition for at-risk young Filipinos.2 In addition, the program contains measures that will help \ncounter the effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on the broader labor market \nboth now and into the post-COVID-19 recovery.3 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  The Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the programmatic \napproach and loan for subprogram 1 on 23 May 2017.4 Subprogram 1 supported the Government \nof the Philippines in restructuring public employment services and strengthening labor market \nactivation and skills development programs. This provided a foundation for subprogram 2, which \nwas approved on 3 December 2019 together with the addition of subprogram 3.5 Subprogram 2: \n(i) enhanced the ability of youth to secure long-term employment by introducing new labor market \nprograms and training opportunities; and (ii) strengthened labor market policies. Building on the \nreform  measures  achieved  under  subprogram  1  and  2,  subprogram  3  provides  improved \nemployment opportunities for youth and includes direct responses to\u2014and innovative features \ndesigned to overcome\u2014the challenges posed by the unprecedented community quarantine \nmeasures used to constrain the COVID-19 pandemic. The program also reflects the government\u2019s \ncommitment  to  gender  equality  in  its  pandemic  response,  given  that  women  have  been \nparticularly affected. A post-program partnership framework (P3F) for 2021\u20132022 will ensure \nprogram sustainability and provide a foundation for the next program on post-COVID-19 business \nand employment recovery planned for 2022 (footnote 3). Key accomplishments of the program \nare summarized in the box. \n \nBox: Key Accomplishments \n \nProgrammatic Approach \n\u2022  To help Filipinos find employment and improve their skills, the number of Public Employment \nService Offices (PESOs) was expanded to almost 1,500, of which one-third are fully functional, \nwith more than 4,000 additional barangay-based PESOs enlisted to assist with coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) recovery efforts. \n\u2022  To help young Filipinos bridge the school-to-work divide, JobStart Philippines has served almost \n20,000 youth, more than half of whom are women, with a 67% placement rate. \n\u2022  The Special Program for Employment of Students has provided first jobs for more than 393,500 \nyoung Filipinos, over half of whom are women. \n \n1  Defined as young people 15\u201324 years old who are mostly entering the job market for the first time. \n2  The policy design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  The program is included in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2020.

Development problem. Until 2020, the Philippines was one of the best-performing \neconomies  in  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  region.  Prudent \nmacroeconomic  policy  supported  economic  growth, 6  and  sound  fiscal  and  public  debt \nmanagement ensured that the country\u2019s debt profile remained sustainable.7 Gross domestic \nproduct grew by an average 6.6% per annum during 2015\u20132019, with recent strength (2018 and \n2019) attributable to the government\u2019s signature \u201cBuild Build Build\u201d infrastructure program.8 The \nnational poverty rate declined from 23.5% in 2015 to 16.7% in 2018. Likewise, from 2015 to 2019, \nthe national unemployment rate declined from 6.3% to 5.1% and the underemployment rate \ndeclined from 18.5% to 14.0%, representing historic lows. Even the stubbornly high rates of youth \nunemployment, and youth not in employment, education, or training (NEET) declined during this \nperiod (figures 1 and 2). Owing to the strength of the government\u2019s labor market activation \nprograms, youth unemployment had declined to below 15% by 2019 and the persistent positive \ngap between the unemployment rates of young women and men had narrowed. At the same time, \nhowever, the level of youth NEET in the Philippines was the highest in Southeast Asia in 2018 \nand varied considerably across gender, education level, and regions.9 While also narrowing, in \n2019 the female NEET rate (24.1%) was more than 10 percentage points higher than the male \nNEET rate (13.7%) nationwide and 13 percentage points higher in rural areas. At least one in four \nyoung Filipino women was not active in the labor market or in paid work, which contributed to the \nhigher poverty rate among women. High NEET rates are due primarily to the long and uncertain \ntransition from education to employment.10 It takes a college graduate 2 years and a high school \n \n6  International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  International Monetary Fund. 2020.

Then, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the \nrelated  community  quarantine  measures\u202fdrove  the  economy  into  recession  for  the  first \ntime\u202fsince\u202fthe  Asian  financial  crisis  of  1998.  Gross  domestic  product  contracted\u202fby\u202f9.5%, \nreversing gains in reducing unemployment and\u202fpoverty.\u202fIn fact, the unemployment rate peaked at \n17.2% in\u202fApril 2020 during the strictest lockdown, when almost one in every two Filipinos was not \neconomically active, before easing to 8.7% in October 2020. Moreover, the youth, and young \nwomen in particular, were the first and most affected as they tended to work in the most adversely \nimpacted sectors, including wholesale and retail trade, accommodation and food services, and \nmanufacturing. This disparate impact is similar to the experience globally where 510 million, or \n40% of all employed women, work in these hard-hit sectors.13 Overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) \nwere similarly affected, and again the largest impact fell on women. Of the 2.2 million OFWs \ndeployed in 2019, 1,233,000 (56%) were women and 969,000 (44%) were men. About 57.5% of \nthe deployed OFWs work in elementary occupations or in services and sales, and almost 80% of \nthe OFWs in these sectors are women. Employment prospects for the youth, and especially young \nwomen, remain bleak as companies tend to freeze hiring or hire experienced workers over recent \ngraduates for the fewer available jobs.14 In fact, the youth unemployment rate worsened from \n13.6% in January 2020 to 19.8% in January 2021 (equivalent to 1.4 million jobless young workers) \nand is projected to increase to as high as 22.5% by 2022.15 \n \n6.  Looking ahead, the COVID-19 pandemic could result in hysteresis in employment, where \nthe negative effects on employment are long-lasting, even after the economy recovers. The \n \n11 K. Bird. 2012.

Bangkok and Manila. \n ", "4 \npandemic has triggered a large sectoral reallocation as job losses have been heavily concentrated \nin sectors dependent on personal contact. This will increase skills mismatches as workers are not \nable to transition easily out of these sectors because the emerging business models rely more on \ndigital technology and highly technical skills. Job losses can also lead to hysteresis in employment \nthrough skills erosion. The longer the new labor market entrants and displaced workers remain \nunemployed, the more likely that they become more unemployable. With fewer jobs available and \nthe first batch of kindergarten-to-grade 12 (K\u201312) graduates joining the workforce after the K\u201312 \nreforms, the youth will likely be further marginalized. While labor market facilitation programs have \nbeen strengthened and expanded, more must be done to reduce the level of NEET youth and to \ngive all\u202fFilipinos, including the youth, access to decent jobs and wages. Women, in particular, will \nneed help as they face a digital skill divide, occupy jobs that are at risk of automation, are \nsusceptible to gender-based violence and exploitation, and have shouldered additional household \nburdens during the community quarantine and school closures. \n \n7.  Binding constraints in the COVID-19 pandemic context. Through the program, the \ngovernment was following a well-sequenced plan to address the initial set of binding constraints \nby expanding physical access to labor activation programs and improving their quality, improving \naccess to skills development and higher education, and establishing a solid legal framework to \nfacilitate employment. While the original binding constraints remain valid, addressing them has \nbecome more challenging because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing quarantine \nrestrictions. After consultations with the government, the development constraints have been \nmodified to reflect  the following  challenges  and  emerging  priorities: (i)  capacity  to  provide \ninnovative employment facilitation services locally is limited; (ii) skills development and training \nopportunities are not sufficient relative to the need; and (iii) labor market policies and regulations \nrequire further strengthening and new provisions are needed to address pandemic-related job \nlosses and issues, including those specific to women.16 \n \n8.  Capacity to provide employment facilitation services locally is limited. Under the \nprogram, the number of Public Employment Service Offices (PESOs) and their inventory and \nquality of services have grown and improved. However, the PESO network is not yet of sufficient \nsize and reach, which reduces access, especially for young women in rural areas. Less than one-\nthird of job seekers used public employment services to find jobs, and most of those who did were \nliving in urban areas. This is because PESOs in cities are more likely to be fully functional than \nthose in municipalities. Therefore, more PESOs should be established, operationalized, and \ninstitutionalized across localities nationwide to facilitate employment and increase access to their \nservices.17 Measures  should  also  be  introduced  to  promote  more  consistent  delivery  of \nemployment facilitation services. The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified these challenges in the \nfollowing ways: (i) there are significantly more job seekers than before and (ii) many public \nemployment  facilitation  programs  relied  heavily  on  in-person  contact  and  were  suspended \nbecause of quarantine restrictions. There is a need to adjust these programs to sustain progress \nwhile  minimizing  physical  contact  to  reach  the  newly  unemployed,  as  well  as  \nat-risk youth and women in remote areas. Services offered by PESOs should also be expanded \nto provide specialized assistance to first-time job seekers and to newly displaced and vulnerable \nworkers who are at risk of falling into long-term unemployment, including the roughly half-million \ndisplaced OFWs, 41.6% of whom are women. \n \n \n16 Sector Assessment (Summary): Education (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 An \u201coperationalized\u201d PESO performs at least one core function of employment services. A fully \u201cinstitutionalized\u201d \nPESO complies with the requirements of the Public Employment Service Office Act, 1999, with permanent positions, \nbudget allocations, office space, and a full set of employment services. \n ", "5 \n9.  Skills development and training opportunities are not sufficient relative to the need. \nSubprograms 1 and 2 have done much to improve access to training and address job\u2013skill \nmismatches. Yet many workers, especially young workers and women, still do not have the \nrelevant  skills  required  in  the  modern  workplace.  These  mismatches  persist  because  of \ninadequate  funding  for  training  and  scholarship  programs;  weak  labor  market  information \nsystems; and limited use of the private sector and technology to support education, training, and \noutreach. The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified these skill mismatches as companies are now \nrelying more on technology. Women have been disproportionately affected by these disruptions \nbecause of the digital gender divide, gendered job displacement, and an increased care-giving \nburden arising from the lockdowns. There is an urgent need to: (i) upskill, reskill, and diversify \nworker skills; and (ii) promote specialization to cater to higher value-added services given the \nongoing transformation of jobs, as well as future skills needs. The Philippine Qualifications \nFramework (PQF) has been formally approved, but there is a critical need to implement the \nframework so that graduates of technical-vocational-livelihood training and senior high school can \npursue higher education by receiving recognition for their prior learning. The government should \nalso ensure that the Philippine qualifications mirror the ASEAN standards to increase the mobility \nof and demand for Filipino workers. With the government focused on making the post-pandemic \nrecovery green, new and higher-paying job opportunities could be created for displaced workers, \nand women in particular, but not enough effort has been made to identify and catalog this \nemerging demand. \n \n10.  Labor policies and regulations require further strengthening and new provisions \nare needed to address pandemic-related issues. Robust labor market policies provide vital \nsupport for long-term employment and take on increased importance during economic downturns. \nRecognizing this relationship, the government established the foundation for several support \nmechanisms during subprograms 1 and 2, but these reforms were incomplete. For example, a \nlegal framework for an unemployment insurance scheme was adopted to provide a social safety \nnet to cushion workers from sudden economic shocks. This scheme now needs to be funded and \nactivated. This type of institutional support is particularly important during the pandemic when a \nlarge percentage of the labor force is vulnerable to job and income losses and is at a heightened \nrisk of being pushed back into poverty. Ongoing efforts to protect laborers from abusive practices \nneed to be maintained but also modified to recognize the challenges to providing support while \nsocial distancing. For example, occupational health and safety protocols could be enhanced to \npromote  safe  and  secure  working  environments,  including  minimum  health  and  sanitation \nstandards to be observed, and key pandemic response measures such as calibrated maximum \noccupancy levels which will help facilitate the restoration of pre-pandemic employment levels. \nOngoing efforts to establish a dispute resolution mechanism related to unfair labor practices \nshould be strengthened, but also modified so that it can be accessed through a contactless \nchannel. Beyond the pandemic, this will also open access to rural areas and women by removing \nthe requirement to travel to a physical location to file a grievance. Finally, the unprecedented \neffects  of  the  pandemic  have  given  rise  to  the  need  for  targeted  interventions  for  those \ndisproportionally affected. A half-million displaced OFWs, 41.6% of which are women from highly \naffected sectors need help so that they can reintegrate into the domestic economy.  \n \n11.  The program will help the government increase the income-earning ability of Filipinos \nconsistent with the Philippine Development Plan, 2017\u20132022.18 The program is aligned with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the Philippines, 2018\u20132023 under the third strategic pillar; \ninvesting in people.19 The program is also aligned with the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy \n \n18 Government of the Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority. 2017.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government passed the Bayanihan to \nHeal as One Act in March 2020 and the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act in September 2020 to \nmitigate the adverse socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic. The government also drafted the \nNational Employment Recovery Strategy, 2020\u20132022 with four pillars: (i) stimulating the economy \nand employment; (ii) supporting enterprises, jobs, and income; (iii) protecting workers in the \nworkplace; and (iv) trusting social dialogue to encourage innovative solutions.21 \n \n13.

The Facilitating Youth School-to-Work \nTransition  Program  has  adopted  a  programmatic  approach  using  policy-based  loans  and \ntechnical assistance (TA) to support the government\u2019s reform agenda (footnotes 33 and 34). This \napproach  provides  flexibility  and  enables  mid-course  design  changes,  which  is  particularly \nimportant during highly fluid economic crises such as the one caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe TA helps the government meet capacity-building needs and address policy issues that have \na bearing on strategy decisions. \n \n14.  Reform accomplishments. During the processing of subprogram 2, the government \nagreed to carry out 17 indicative policy actions as the basis for subprogram 3. After the onset of \nthe pandemic, ADB worked with the government to adjust the program to provide an appropriate \nresponse. While the basis of the program remains sound, modifications were made to de-\nemphasize new reforms dependent on in-person contacts and to maximize the use of science, \ntechnology, and innovation in delivering existing employment activation and training programs.22 \nTwo indicative policy actions\u2014statistical profiling to rationalize existing labor market activation \ninitiatives and the establishment of enterprise-led learning networks\u2014were overtaken by the \npandemic and became less relevant or difficult to implement. Two new policy actions were added \nas a direct response to the pandemic. These include initiatives to provide financial relief to support \nfirst-time job seekers, and to require employers to develop and implement programs to prevent \ndiscrimination and harassment in the workplace. Further, several policy actions were modified to \nbetter reflect the government\u2019s commitment to climate resilience, which is also a part of its post-\npandemic recovery initiatives. Subprogram 3 now contains 17 policy actions, all of which have \nbeen accomplished.23 These changes did not result in any significant alteration to the program\u2019s \nintended outcome or impact (para. 26). \n \n15.  Reform area 1: Improved public employment facilitation services. This reform area \nincreases  access  to,  and  improves  the  quality  of,  public  employment  facilitation  services \n \n20 ADB. 2018.

There are four core accomplishments which include \npandemic response measures. First, PESOs serve as distribution points for government labor \nfacilitation programs, including JobStart Philippines (JSP), and implement localized employment \nfacilitation  programs.24  To  directly  expand  and  enhance  the  availability  of  these  public \nemployment services, the government increased the number of operational PESOs to 1,456, of \nwhich 547 are fully institutionalized (footnote 17). To strengthen the government\u2019s pandemic \nresponse, 4,388 barangay-based PESOs were incorporated into the PESO network to support \nskills mapping and targeted delivery of programs at the barangay level. Second, the government \nimproved services using technology by increasing the number of PESOs using the PESO \nEmployment  Information  System  (PEIS)  to  1,607.  Similarly,  to  provide  better  targeting  for \npandemic response programs, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) implemented \nthe Establishment Report System in conjunction with PEIS to use sex-disaggregated job loss data \nto better target benefits. In recognition of the large numbers of OFWs who are female, the system \nhas  been  expanded  to  collect  sex-disaggregated  job  loss  data  for  OFWs  to  better  target \nassistance under DOLE\u2019s COVID-19 Adjustment Measures Program. Recognizing the limitations \narising from community quarantine measures, a digital chatbot was also launched to enable \njobseekers to remotely register information into the PEIS. Third, the government strengthened the \ncapacity of PESO managers by implementing uniform performance standards and integrating \ngender sensitivity in training programs and assessment instruments in recognition of the large \nnumber of displaced female workers who will be using the service. The development of uniform \ncompetency and performance standards for PESO staff has been approved and launched. \nFourth, the implementation and outreach of JSP was enhanced. The level of participating local \ngovernment units providing counterpart funding was increased to 61%. DOLE established a pool \nof PESO staff to deliver  life skills training (LST) and increased the number of companies \nparticipating in the JSP from 75 to 292.25 To provide LST to a wider audience through distance \nlearning, DOLE developed a digital gender sensitive LST program with modules covering digital \nliteracy, sexual and reproductive health and rights, women\u2019s empowerment, and work ethics.  \n \n16.  COVID-19 response measures under reform area 1. In addition, there are two key direct \npandemic response related accomplishments. First, the enactment of the First Time Jobseekers \nAct established the PESOs as one-stop-shops to help first-time jobseekers secure most pre-\nemployment documents without charge, easing the financial burden of obtaining employment. \nSecond, DOLE enhanced the Special Program for Employment of Students (SPES) to provide \ntemporary employment opportunities for poor and out-of-school youth, by implementing SPES in \nareas under community quarantine to promote working from home. Throughout the program, \nSPES has provided first jobs to more than 393,500 young Filipinos, more than half of whom are \nwomen. DOLE also upgraded the quality management system of SPES. \n \n17.  Reform area 2: Enhanced skills development and training systems. This reform area \nexpands access to training and enhances education\u2013employment links for young job seekers and \nwomen to help them upskill and meet the emerging demand for workers with higher-level skills. \nThere are four key accomplishments. First, the government established the \u20b11 billion Tulong \nTrabaho Scholarship Fund to cover the full payment of training fees, learning materials, and \nrelated costs under technical and vocational education and training\u2019s (TVET) Selected Training \nPrograms.26 Implementing rules and regulations were issued to establish who is qualified for this \nfinancial support, how it will be implemented, and the oversight responsibilities of the Technical \n \n24 In 2019, 2.4 million applicants requested placement services, of whom 2.2 million, or 92%, found employment. \n25 Represented sectors include food and accommodation, tourism, manufacturing, trade, and construction. \n26 Eligible applicants include Filipino citizens who are at least 15 years of age and NEET, including displaced workers \nand the long-term unemployed. \n \n ", "8 \nEducation and Skills Development Authority (TESDA). In addition, an omnibus regulation covering \nthe Tulong Trabaho and all similar scholarship funds was issued by TESDA which prioritized \nwomen, informal workers, OFWs and their dependents, and persons with disabilities. Second, the \ngovernment is now implementing the PQF to enhance and strengthen education\u2013employment \nlinks  which  will  increase  the  employability  of  graduates.  Technical  working  groups  were \nestablished to address, among others, pathways and equivalencies, international alignment, and \nlifelong learning. A comprehensive review of the PQF was also completed to improve its design \nand implementation, and the government referenced the PQF with the ASEAN Qualifications \nReference Framework to align domestic and ASEAN qualification standards, facilitating regional \nworker mobility. Third, TESDA encouraged greater mobility between education tracks, and \ncatalyzed greater demand for higher education in general by facilitating movement between TVET \nand higher education institutions via credit transfer arrangements and recognition of prior learning. \nThe Commission on Higher Education and TESDA also organized a joint working group to \nharmonize  strategies,  policies,  and  programs  for  the  interface  between  TVET  and  higher \neducation. This mechanism will allow learners to pursue learning opportunities, upgrade their \nqualifications, or smoothly transition through different learning pathways. Fourth, the government \nopened additional areas of employment through the Green Jobs Act 2016 by launching a National \nGreen Jobs Human Resource Development Plan, including tailor-made learning systems for at-\nrisk groups, such as women and migrant and informal workers. \n \n18.  COVID-19 response measures under reform area 2. In addition, there is one key direct \npandemic response related accomplishment. TESDA encouraged women to participate in the \nlabor market by: (i) creating promotional videos about successful women in nontraditional sectors; \n(ii) offering affordable online training programs that increased total enrollment by more than 1 \nmillion (of whom 59% are women); and (iii) producing informational videos coaching women on \nCOVID-19 mental health awareness. \n \n19.  Reform area 3: Strengthened labor market policies. This reform area has three key \naccomplishments. First, the government launched an unemployment insurance scheme under \nthe amended Social Security Act, provided funding, and began paying claims. In 2020, the \nscheme paid P1.7 billion in unemployment insurance benefits to 136,000 claimants. Second, \nDOLE enhanced its ability to carry out labor inspection activities and launched a program to \ndeliver  occupational  safety  and  health  training  that  includes  gender-responsive  workplace \nstandards at both educational and commercial institutions. The number of safety inspectors was \nincreased by 500, bringing the total to 1,210 personnel to carry out labor inspection activities. \nThird,  to  reduce  discrimination  and  harassment  in  the  workplace,  the  government  issued \nguidelines which define and prohibit such behavior.  \n \n20.  COVID-19 response measures under reform area 3. In addition, there are three key \ndirect pandemic response related accomplishments. First, DOLE facilitated the reintegration of \nOFWs by implementing group livelihood programs (800 beneficiaries of whom 16% are women), \nor by providing education assistance for their dependents to attend college (3,000 individual \nbeneficiaries). DOLE also partnered with the private sector to implement the OFW Reintegration \nthrough Skills and Entrepreneurship Program. Of the 94 graduates through end-February 2021, \n57 or 61% are women. Second, DOLE assessed all its displacement-related programs to provide \na  basis  to  consolidate  existing  programs,  introduce  new  programs,  and  expand  program \ncoverage. Third, a digital version of the single-entry approach (e-SEnA) was rolled out, and \nguidelines  issued  on  conducting  conciliation  and  mediation  services  digitally,  including  the \ncollection of sex-disaggregated data.27 A total of 530 single-entry assistance desk officers (52% \nof whom are women) were trained.  \n \n27 e-SEnA is a free online service that facilitates requests for the conduct of conciliation-mediation under SEnA. \n ", "9 \n21.  Post-program partnership framework. The P3F will be grounded in ADB\u2019s COVID-19 \nPandemic Response Option monitoring framework.28 The P3F itself will be utilized for a structured \npolicy dialogue between ADB and the government, which reflects the government\u2019s commitment \nto sustaining and advancing the reform agenda. Under the P3F, the government will: (i) continue \nexpanding the PESO network and consolidate employment facilitation websites into a single \nwindow; (ii) explore the national rollout of JSP with an increased emphasis on gender coverage \nand closing the gender gap; (iii) launch enterprise-led learning networks and explore the use of \ngender-related criteria in awarding the matching grants; (iv) reform the apprenticeship system; \nand (v) review and strengthen social protection through a fiscally sustainable unemployment \ninsurance scheme and paid sick leave. Overall, the gender focus will be strengthened, given the \ndisparate impact the pandemic has had on women. Finally, the P3F will provide input to the \nformulation of the post-COVID-19 employment recovery program planned for 2022 (footnote 3). \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s value addition to program design and implementation. Through its long-term \nengagement with the government, ADB has helped identify key sector constraints and design a \ncomprehensive reform program. Supported by the Government of Canada, ADB helped DOLE \ndesign, pilot test, and roll out JSP. ADB has also helped DOLE proactively respond to the \nchallenges emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic by digitizing LST and launching a digital \nchatbot, which, as among the government\u2019s first digital transformation initiatives, enabled a \nreduction of in-person contacts at PESOs during the pandemic and increased outreach to the \nunderserved.  ADB  also  supported  TESDA  with  a  TVET  sector  study  that  provided \nrecommendations  on  the  design  of  new  training  courses  focused  on  the  Fourth  Industrial \nRevolution.29 Finally, ADB is working on an investment project to support innovation in the TVET \nsector, which will complement the program by providing specific solutions to tackle the low \nemployability of TVET graduates and the limited opportunities for upskilling the workforce.30 \n \n23.  ADB experience. ADB has actively supported the Philippines\u2019 education, employment, \nand social protection agenda through TA, investment projects, and policy-based loans (Figure 3). \nADB approved an investment project in 2010 to implement the government\u2019s social protection \nagenda, which encouraged the poor to attend school using conditional cash transfers. Since then, \nADB has provided two loans for additional financing, bringing the project\u2019s total financing to  \n$1 billion and expanding its coverage.31 To transition to a K\u201312 basic education cycle, the ADB-\nfinanced Senior High School Support Program introduced two additional grades in senior high \nschool. The follow-on Secondary Education Support Program continued ADB\u2019s support for the \ngovernment\u2019s K\u201312 Basic Education Program and improved secondary-level student learning \noutcomes and completion rates.32 The Increasing Competitiveness for Inclusive Growth Program \n \n28 ADB. 2020.

Lessons  learned.  ADB\u2019s  partnership  with  the  government  and  engagement  in \nemployment  facilitation  and  the  education  sector  have  informed  the  program.  First,  youth \nunemployment is a complex structural issue needing strong commitment and support from both \nthe public and private sector. A combination of policy-based lending, investment projects, and TA \nprovides the required comprehensive approach. Second, given the high sensitivity of youth \nunemployment to external shocks, such as pandemics or disasters triggered by natural hazards, \nthe government needs to remain flexible and tailor reforms to meet the specific needs of the \nsituation (e.g., by sectors, age groups, or gender).  Performance targets and reform actions \nshould be reviewed and adjusted throughout the program to ensure their appropriateness and \nrelevance. Third, interventions to address youth unemployment should consider the future of jobs \nwhich are becoming increasingly mobile, and technologically and environmentally focused. In \naddition, the program highlighted the overwhelming disparate impact the pandemic has had on \nwomen through job losses in the service industry, exacerbating prevailing gender inequalities \n(footnote 13). Looking ahead, programs supporting employment recovery will need to further \naddress this impact and reduce the gender gaps in both youth unemployment and NEET rates.  \n \n25.  Development  partner  coordination.  ADB  has  maintained  strong  partnerships  with \ndevelopment partners active in the sector, including the Government of Canada, which cofinanced \nthe rollout of JSP in 2013 (footnote 34).

Expected Outcome of the Reforms \n \n26.  Impact  of  the  reforms.  The  program  is  aligned  with  the  country\u2019s  overarching \ndevelopment objective of increasing the wage employment rate of the country\u2019s youth. Just before \nthe pandemic, most outcome indicator targets had already been achieved. As of October 2019, \nthe NEET rate was 17.2%, below the target of 19.4%, and the youth unemployment rate was \n12.9%, below the target of 13.1%. However, by January 2021, the unprecedented effects of the \nCOVID-19  pandemic  had  caused  the  NEET  rate  to  increase  to  19.4%  and  the  youth \nunemployment rate to rise to 19.8%. The government has acknowledged the impact of the \npandemic  and  revised  its  targets:  the  NEET  rate  upward  to  17%\u201319%  and  the  youth \nunemployment rate upward to 20.5%\u201322.5%, both by 2022.37 In response, program targets have \nbeen reset as follows: the youth unemployment rate target for 2022 was revised to \u201cdeclined to \nbetween 18.5% to 19.5% from the updated 2020 baseline of 21.7%. The program impact \nassessment confirms that the program\u2019s direct impact will be on youth unemployment and youth \nNEET and will benefit women. Without the program, the male and female NEET rates would return \nto, and likely stay at, elevated rates not seen since 2010: 36.1% for females and 22.2% for males \n(Figure 2).38  Similarly, youth unemployment rates would rise to 21.9% for females and 18.3% for \nmales. With the program, and assuming a quick recovery, proportionately more women will return \nto employment with their unemployment rate falling by 2.4 percentage points to 19.5% compared \nto a 1.6 percentage point decline for men. This will reduce the unemployment rate gender gap \nfrom 3.6 percentage points to 2.8 percentage points. Youth NEET rates exhibit a similar but less-\npronounced pattern. The female youth NEET rate is expected to recover to 30.4% and the male \nyouth NEET rate to 14.7% by 2022. This equates to a decline in female youth NEET by 0.6 million \nand male youth NEET by 0.8 million. However, the gender gap for the NEET rate remains elevated \nbecause relatively more men are expected to enter employment and school during the recovery \nthan women.39 Finally, the number of youth TVET graduates is expected to increase to 1.1 million \nfrom 0.8 million without the program (a 37.5% increase), with women accounting for 0.3 million or \n52.9% of this increase. These additional youth TVET graduates will produce a real wage increase \ntotaling $296,250,099 by 2022, of which $157,012,553 will accrue to females. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n27.  The government has requested a regular loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period \n \n35 ILO. 2020. The Future of Work in the Philippines: Assessing the Impact of Technological Changes on Occupations \nand Sectors.

Based on the annuity repayment \nmethod, the average maturity is 12.1 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \nThe loan size was increased from the indicative $300 million, reflecting a higher financing need, \nas well as the development impact arising from the policy reform package. For fiscal year 2021, \nthe  government\u2019s  total  gross  borrowing  requirement  is  estimated  to  reach  $62.3  billion, \nrepresenting a substantial increase of more than $20 billion over 2019. To finance the budget \ndeficit, the government plans to raise $53.3 billion from domestic borrowings, $3.2 billion from \nofficial development assistance, and $5.8 billion from other external sources. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n28.  The Department of Finance is the executing agency for the program. DOLE and TESDA \nare  the  implementing  agencies.  The  implementation  period  is  April  2019\u2013April  2021.  The \nproceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  withdrawn  following  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n29.  Safeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \nis classified category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people\u2019s \nsafeguards. The program is not expected to have any environmental or social safeguards impacts \nwithin the meaning of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n30.  Climate  change.  The  program  supports  climate  adaptation  and  mitigation.  Of  the  \n17 policy actions under subprogram 3, 12 have climate adaptation benefits, and 11 have climate \nmitigation benefits. Climate adaptation benefits are estimated at $13.53 million and mitigation \nbenefits at $9.41 million.40 The passage and subsequent implementation of the Green Jobs Act \nhas established a continuing framework, including fiscal incentives, to  encourage business \nenterprises to generate and sustain green jobs. \n \n31.  Poverty  and  social.  While  the  Philippines  is  on  track  to  meet  the  Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal target of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030, there are still 17.7 million \nFilipinos who do not earn enough to afford basic food and other needs. This is because of the \nhigh rates of unemployment and underemployment, especially among young Filipinos. The \nprogram directly helps the government reduce unemployment, and youth unemployment in \nparticular, by improving public employment services, enhancing skills development and training, \nand strengthening labor market policies. It will help provide the population at large, Filipino youth, \nand especially young women with better access to high-quality, long-term stable employment \nopportunities, which will drive inclusive economic growth and social stability. \n \n32.  Gender. The program is categorized as Gender Equity Theme as it aims to address \nseveral key gender issues. First, women have a lower labor force participation rate (47.6%) than \nmen (74.8%), and a higher NEET rate (footnote 38). This is largely attributed to the additional \nresponsibilities shouldered by women, including extra childcare because of school closures during \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, other care giving, and domestic work. Second, women have been most \naffected by the pandemic as they account for a large share of the returned OFWs and dominate \nthe services and informal sector. Third, gender-based violence in the workplace is one of the \n \n40 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "13 \nmajor barriers to women\u2019s full economic participation. Finally, the weak institutional capacity of \nagencies involved in youth employment for gender mainstreaming prevents them from effectively \naddressing the gender determinants of youth unemployment.  \n \n33.  To proactively address these issues, the government expanded the PESO network and \nincreased access to PEIS to provide access to rural youth and women, as well as the large \nnumbers of returned OFWs. The government partnered with the private sector to roll out group \nlivelihood programs and education assistance packages to help returned OFWs, who are mostly \nwomen, reintegrate into the domestic economy. A scholarship fund for TVET was established \nwhich identified women and returned OFWs as one of its primary beneficiaries. In addition, \ntargeted programs\u2014such as the SPES and TESDA\u2019s promotional videos and online training \nprograms\u2014have  been  launched  to  encourage  and  help  women  enter  the  workforce.  The \ngovernment has expanded the collection of sex-disaggregated data into these new programs to \nimprove  their  targeting.  The  program  has  also  adopted  contactless  arrangements  in  key \nemployment facilitation programs. As part of this effort, modules have been incorporated into \nthese programs covering gender issues such as sexual and reproductive health and rights, and \ninstructors have been trained to focus on gender equality and non-violence in the workplace. \nDOLE has issued occupational safety and health guidelines for the private sector to address and \nprevent harassment and discrimination in the workplace. Finally, the government has launched \nthe National Green Jobs Human Resources Development Plan, which includes tailor-made \nlearning systems for at-risk groups, such as women and migrant and informal workers. \n \n34.  Governance.  A  public expenditure  and  financial  accountability  assessment  in  2016 \npointed to improvements that had been made to public financial management (PFM) and fiduciary \narrangements,  especially  policy-based  budgeting,  transparency,  and  asset\u2013liability \nmanagement.41 The government used these findings to improve PFM further. It implemented a \nshift from obligation-based budgeting to a cash-based budgeting system in 2019. The cash-based \nbudgeting system is based on annual cash payments for contractual obligations in a fiscal year \nand aims to incentivize government agencies to be more proactive with budget planning, costing, \nand timeliness of procurement and implementation. The Budget and Treasury Management \nSystem was launched in 2019 to integrate all essential PFM functions across relevant government \nagencies in a consolidated database.  \n \n35.  Risk and mitigating measures. The overall risk for the program is moderate. Major risks \nand  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  the  table  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan.42 \n \nSummary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nDelayed COVID-19 vaccine rollout  The government has prepared a well-structured vaccine \nprolongs the pandemic and holds back  distribution and administration program and has begun the \neconomic growth, causing overall and  rollout.
