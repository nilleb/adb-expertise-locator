ADB  will  provide  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  in  the  amount  of \n$1,450,000 to prepare the project. The PPTA will prepare a project design and detailed costings \nin line with government policy and strategies and Asian Development Bank (ADB) requirements. \nThe design will include a competitive research fund, a pilot student loan scheme an assessment \nof the regulatory framework for higher education and a feasibility study of the use of PPPs to \ndeliver the campus at Savannakhet University. It will also identify and undertake site preparation \nat the new campus of Savannakhet University, in order to speed up project implementation.  \n \nB.  Justification \n2.  Continued  modernization,  the  shift  to  a  more  knowledge-  and  technology-based \neconomy,  and  increasing  economic  integration  are  placing  increased  pressure  on  the \ngovernment of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) to improve the performance of \nits higher education sector. The country has made considerable progress in lifting access to \ntertiary education, albeit from a very small base. However, poor quality and relevance remain \nsignificant  issues  for  the  Lao  PDR  higher  education  sector.  A  2011  analysis identified  an \n \nincreasing lack of educated and skilled human resources as a critical constraint to inclusive \ngrowth  in  Lao  PDR\u2019s  transforming  economy  and  a  constraint  private  sector  growth  and \neconomic diversification.1 The proposed second strengthening higher education project (the \nproject) aims to support the government of Lao PDR by providing assistance to enhance quality \nand relevance of higher education, upgrade the academic and research capacity of the higher \neducation system, and deliver a new campus at Savannakhet University.2  \n \n3.  A PPTA is required in order to undertake technical work on the design of the project, \nincluding design of the pilot student loan scheme, the involvement of private higher education \ninstitutions (HEIs), and architectural and preparatory work on the new campus at Savannakhet \nUniversity.  Given  the  range  of  interventions  proposed  under  the  project  will  also  require \nconsiderable consultation with the Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES) and stakeholder \ngroups such as public and private HEIs, employers and private sector to determine the scope of \ninterventions  to  lift  access,  quality  and  relevance.  Lessons  learned  from  the  ongoing \nstrengthening higher education project (SHEP) will inform the design work and implementation \narrangements.  \n \nC.  Major Outputs and Activities \n4.  The outputs of the PPTA will include (i) assessing and documenting of progress made \nunder SHEP and its implications for the project; (ii) preparing an assessment of the higher \neducation sector in Lao PDR, including benchmarking against Greater Mekong Subregion and \nother Asian countries, and identification of higher education sector constraints and issues; (iii) \ndesigning a project in line with government policy and strategies and ADB requirements, and \nprepare detailed project costings; (iv) identifying proposed program areas for HEI centers of \nteaching  and  research  excellence;  (v)  developing  an  innovation  fund  for  extra-curricular \nactivities and a competitive research fund; (vi) developing a pilot student loan scheme and \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2011.
