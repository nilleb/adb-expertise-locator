I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nwithout  government  guarantee  to  KEPCO  SPC  Power  Corporation  (KSPC)  to  finance  the \nconstruction, operation, and maintenance of a 200-megawatt (MW) coal-fired power plant in \nNaga City, Cebu, in the Visayas region of the Philippines (the Project). The plant will use \ncirculating  fluidized  bed  (CFB)  combustion  boiler  technology\u2014a  more  environment-friendly \ntechnology\u2014and provide much-needed base-load power to the Visayas grid. This Project will \nrepresent  the  first  collaboration  between  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  Korean \nExport-Import Bank (KEXIM) under a memorandum of understanding signed in 2008 by the two \ninstitutions  as  part  of  the  Asian  Infrastructure  Financing  Initiative.  The  project  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  The Visayas region in the Philippines\u2014an important center of industry, trade, education, \nand tourism for the country\u2014is facing an imminent power crisis. Intermittent blackouts now take \nplace on Cebu, Panay, and Negros islands and are expected to become more frequent until \nnew generation is brought on-line. Overreliance on the region's abundant geothermal resources \nand  low  tariffs,  which  were  not  allowed  to  rise  to  pay  for  new  capacity,  has  resulted  in \nunderinvestment in the region's power generation resources, particularly intermediate and base \nload. As a result, the power mix in the Visayas is extremely dichotomous, with 71% currently \ngenerated from geothermal sources and 22% from old, very inefficient, and less environment-\nfriendly diesel power plants with variable costs for generation four or five times as high as the \nvariable costs of geothermal. Moreover, tight supply conditions are an obstacle to progress in \nthe reform agenda for power of the Government of the Philippines (the Government) embodied \nin the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 (EPIRA). Specifically, implementation of the \nwholesale electricity spot market (WESM) in the Visayas grid has been deferred due to the \nassumption that spot prices would be excessively high if the supply\u2013demand balance is not \nimproved prior to launch.  \n3.  In November 2005, National Power Corporation (NPC)1 and Power Sector Assets and \nLiabilities  Management  Corporation  (PSALM)2  conducted  an  open  and  competitive  public \nbidding  for  a  lease  covering  8.4  hectares  of  land  within  the  existing  Naga  Power  Plant \nComplex.3 The primary bid document was a land lease agreement (LLA) requiring the winning \nbidder to construct, operate, and maintain a base-load merchant power plant with a minimum \ncapacity of 100 MW on the leased land for a term of 25 years. KEPCO Philippines Holdings Inc. \n(KPHI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), the national \nelectric  utility  of  the  Republic  of  Korea,  was  the  winning  bidder.  However,  SPC  Power \nCorporation (SPC) had been given the option to top the winning bid and it exercised its right to \ndo so. NPC, PSALM and SPC signed the LLA in December 2005. Subsequently, KPHI and SPC \n                                                 \n1  NPC, a state-owned electricity utility, was solely responsible for electricity generation and transmission in the \nPhilippines.  The  National  Transmission  Corporation  (TransCo)  was  formed  to  take  over  responsibility  of \ntransmission with the passage and implementation of the EPIRA. \n2  The EPIRA created PSALM to privatize certain generating assets of NPC.  \n3  The  complex  is  currently  operated  by  SPC  Power  Corporation  (previously  Salcon  Corporation)  under  a \nrehabilitation, operation, maintenance, and management agreement with NPC. The 203.8 MW complex includes \nfour generating plants: 6 x 7.3 MW Cebu Diesel Plant I, 2 x 27.5 MW Land-Based Gas Turbines, the 50 MW Naga \nCoal-Fired Thermal Plant 1, and the 56.8 MW Naga Coal-Fired Thermal Plant 2. The agreement expires in 2012. \nThese plants are quite old and have very low efficiencies. In 2008, NPC announced plans to either \u201ctake out or \nrehabilitate\u201d the existing power plants after the agreement expires. ", "2 \nformed a joint venture (60%/40%) to implement the Project, and the LLA was assigned to \nKSPC. The Project was granted \"pioneer status\" and given an array of investment incentives, \nsuch as a 6-year income tax holiday starting from commercial operations and reduced tariffs for \nimported equipment. \n \n4.  The first unit of the Project was originally scheduled to begin operation in December \n2008 and the second unit in June 2009. However, construction was delayed primarily due to \ndifficulties KSPC encountered in signing power sales contracts (PSCs) with local distribution \nutilities. Most distribution utilities had PSCs with NPC, under which they were given NPC time-\nof-use rates that were very low compared with prices needed for cost recovery of a base-load \npower plant. Indeed, the rates were not enough for NPC to cover its own costs of providing \npower from its geothermal and diesel power plants and its power purchase agreements with \nindependent power producers. The lack of PSCs in turn meant KSPC had difficulty securing \ndebt financing for the Project. \n \n5.  Several developments have since compelled distribution utilities in the Visayas to sign \nPSCs with private generators. First, the supply shortage in the Visayas has become so critical \nthat virtually no reserves are available on the Visayas grid. Second, NPC is no longer signing \nnew PSCs, which means any distribution utility that anticipates load growth within its franchise \nwill have to purchase power from new sources. Third, NPC has already privatized 58% of its \ngenerating assets, and continues to sell its plants. Distribution utilities are therefore concerned \nthat NPC may not be able to access enough power to meet its delivery obligations under its \nPSCs. Finally, in February 2009 the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) approved raising the \ntime-of-use rates by 48% in the Visayas from P2.89/kilowatt-hour (kWh) to P4.27/kWh to more \naccurately reflect NPC's true cost of providing electricity.  \n \n6.  With an increasing number of PSCs signed and its competitive tender for engineering, \nprocurement, and construction (EPC) services completed, KSPC arranged bridge loans with \nKEXIM and Korean Exchange Bank, and commenced construction on the Project in December \n2007. KSPC engaged Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) as lead arranger for the \ncommercial loan syndication. KEXIM and SMBC began due diligence on the Project in July \n2008. KSPC and KEXIM approached ADB for assistance in December 2008. ADB joined the \ndue diligence process for the Project in late January and obtained concept clearance on 6 \nMarch 2009. \n \nA.  Sector Performance \n7.  Since  1936,  NPC  has  been  the  state-owned  entity  responsible  for  generation  and \ntransmission of electricity in the Philippines under the development plans of the Department of \nEnergy  (DOE).  It  is  heavily  indebted  and  lacks  the  financial  and  technical  resources  to \nadequately invest in any new or even existing assets. Over the past decade, the Philippines has \ngradually restructured its power subsector under the EPIRA, which outlines comprehensive \nreforms  to  encourage  more  private  sector  investment  and  thus  relieve  the  Government\u2019s \nfinancial  burden  for  developing  the  national  power  system.  Such  measures  will  allow  the \nGovernment to divert its scarce financial resources to much-needed social and infrastructure \nprograms  that  are  more  focused  on  poverty  reduction.  Moreover,  greater  private  sector \ninvolvement is expected to improve the system's efficiency and reliability, as well as increase \ncompetition. This would result in more affordable electricity tariffs that could spur economic \ngrowth and reduce poverty. \n \n ", "3 \n8.  The EPIRA was designed to establish a model similar to that implemented in countries \nsuch as Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore. The main features include (i) a separate and \nprivately operated transmission company, (ii) competing generation companies bidding into a \nWESM,  (iii)  all  or  part  of  the  retail  market  open  to  competition,  and  (iv)  an  independent \nregulatory body. Appendix 2 contains a detailed description of the EPIRA and an update of its \nimplementation.  \n \n9.  Due to the country's geographic layout, the power system in the Philippines is divided \ninto three major grids, each serving one of the country's three regions\u2014Luzon (northern), \nVisayas  (central),  Mindanao  (south).  While  many  of  the  national  institutions  necessary  for \nreform have been established, the pace of implementation has varied across regions with Luzon \nleading  the  way.  The  following  particular  features  of  the  Visayas  grid  have  led  to  unique \nchallenges in implementation for the region. \n \n1.  Industry Structure \n10.  Generation. In 2008, approximately 71% of power supplied to the Visayas grid came \nfrom geothermal sources primarily from Leyte and Samar, 22% from diesel, and 6% from coal. \nCebu currently represents about 46% of total Visayas demand; but with only 25% of the total \ncapacity it has the highest power deficit.  \n \nTable 1: Installed and Dependable Capacity, by Fuel Source, in the Visayas, 2008 \n \n  Installed Capacity    Dependable Capacity    Electricity Generation \nFuel Source  MW  %    MW  %    GWh  % \nCoal  198  11  155  10  504  6 \nDiesel and Oil  604  33  419  28  1,786  22 \nHydropower  11  1  10  1  38  0 \nNatural Gas  55  3  48  3  21  0 \nGeothermal  964  53  861  58  5,691  71 \n  Total  1,832  100  1,493  100  8,040  100 \nGWh = gigawatt-hour, MW = megawatt. \nNote: Figures may not sum precisely because of rounding. \nSource: Department of Energy power statistics. \n \n11.  Power generation in the Visayas by ownership is shown in Table 2. NPC controls about \n70%  of  generation  capacity  in  the  Visayas  through  outright  ownership  or  power  purchase \nagreements. Distribution utilities own almost all of the hydropower, and private companies own \nmost  of  the  diesel.  The  largest  private  generators  in  the  Visayas,  including  those  under \nindependent power producer arrangements, are Global Business Power Corp. (Global Power), \nSPC Corporation, and Philippine National Oil Company\u2013Energy Development Corporation.4 The \n                                                 \n4  Global Power is part of Metrobank Group and owns 247 MW of installed capacity. It is also part owner of the  \n246 MW Toledo Expansion Project in Cebu. SPC Corporation, 40% owner of the project company, owns or \noperates 372 MW of generating capacity in the Visayas grid, 204 MW of which is under a rehabilitation, operation, \nmaintenance, and management agreement with NPC until 2012 and about 169 MW of which was recently won in a \nprivatization bid. Philippine National Oil Company\u2013Energy Development Corporation (PNOC-EDC) is 60% owned \nby First Gen, a Lopez Group company, and operates 659 MW in the Visayas, 610 MW of which is the Leyte A \nGeothermal Plant, which has a power purchase agreements between NPC and Philippine National Oil Company\u2013\nEnergy Development Corporation that expires in 2021/2022. To ensure a competitive market, the EPIRA requires \nthat no one company, including its related entities, may own more than 30% of the installed generating capacity of \none grid or 25% of the total installed generating capacity nationwide.   \n ", "4 \n400 MW of Non-NPC dependable capacity includes 171 MW recently privatized under EPIRA's \nframework. Appendix 3 shows the ownership of each generation plant. \n \nTable 2: Installed Capacity and Generation in the Visayas by Ownership, 2008 \n \n  Installed    Dependable   \n  Capacity    Capacity   \nOwnership  (MW)  %  (MW)  % \nNPC  401  22  330  22 \nIPP with PPAs with NPC  812  45  763  51 \nNon-NPC  618  34  400  27 \n  Total  1,832  100  1,493  100 \nIPP = independent power producer, MW = megawatt, NPC = National Power Corporation, \nPPA = power purchase agreement. \nSource: Department of Energy, Power Statistics. \n \n12.  The WESM was launched in Luzon in 2006 and, year-to-date, an average of about 23% \nof power is being bought on it. In the Visayas, the WESM has been run on a trial basis since \nlate 2006, and ERC granted approval to launch it in 2008, but DOE delayed the official launch \ndue to the tight demand and supply situation in the Cebu, Negros, and Panay subgrid. The \nshortage of supply cannot be readily rectified by transmission upgrades alone. The Visayas grid \ntherefore requires new generation, but private investors have been reluctant to build new plants \nwithout  a  functioning  spot  market,  government  guarantees,  or  long-term  power  purchase \nagreements. Since the latter two options run counter to the new regime that policy makers \nwould like to implement, extending the WESM to the Visayas is essential to ensure adequate \ngeneration to meet projected demand. Yet WESM implementation is likely to result in very high \nprices in the short term (which could be politically difficult) until, paradoxically, new generation \ncan be brought on-line to bring prices down. This impasse has been a barrier for several years \nto both implementation of sector reform and establishment of new generation capacity, leading \nto the power crisis in the Visayas today.  \n \n13.  To stabilize supply, in January 2009 DOE initiated implementation of the Visayas Supply \nAugmentation  Auction  Program,  to  be  administered  by  the  Philippine  Electricity  Market \nCorporation and the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP). The auction program \nis a day-ahead market, which allows entities that have their own power supply to use their own \ngenerators and grid-connected customers to sell interruptible portions of their loads through an \nauction process. The auction program is a form of demand management that will ease the \nsupply deficit by adding as much as 137 MW and will serve as an interim measure until the \nWESM launch. Generators will then be able to sell power to the WESM as well as through \nbilateral contracts with distribution utilities and progressively to large users and households after \nERC determines that all requirements have been met for \"open access\" (Appendix 2).  \n \n14.  Transmission. NGCP is the private concessionaire charged with improving, expanding, \noperating, and maintaining the country's transmission system. The transmission system in the \nVisayas is a long and narrow string of island grids covering Bohol, Cebu, Leyte, Negros, Panay, \nand Samar, connected by submarine cables with limited capacity. While Leyte has a surplus of \ngeneration available given its rich geothermal resources, constraints on transmission capacity \nlimit the export of this power to the Cebu, Negros, and Panay subgrid. Fortifying submarine \ninterconnectors in the Visayas grid as the solution to the power crisis in the region is not viewed \nas optimal or efficient from a technical or economical viewpoint, because it is very costly and \n ", "5 \nwould not substantially improve the system's reliability. Thus, DOE advocates building more \ncapacity on each island as the best way to enhance the region's energy security (Appendix 3).  \n \n15.  Distribution. The distribution of electricity remains a regulated activity under the EPIRA. \nDistribution utilities are given an exclusive franchise to operate in a particular geographic area. \nOf the 141 distribution utilities nationwide, 16 are private investor-owned utilities, 6 are owned \nby local government units, and 119 are customer-owned electric cooperatives. The electric \ncooperatives are regulated by the National Electrification Administration (NEA); its mission is to \nexpand rural electrification; provide financial, institutional and technical support to the electric \ncooperatives;  and  prepare  electric  cooperatives  to  operate  and  compete  in  a  deregulated \nenvironment.  \n \n16.  Aboitiz Power Corporation owns distribution utilities covering one third (about 350 MW) \nof the demand in the Visayas, including the Visayan Electric Company Inc., the second-largest \nprivately  owned  distribution  utility  in  the  Philippines.  Aboitiz  Power  Corporation  also  has \nsignificant equity interests in generation assets totaling 394 MW.5 Moreover, Vivant Corporation \nhas interests in many of the same power companies as Aboitiz Power Corporation, including \nCebu Energy Development Corporation, Visayan Electric Company, and Cebu Private Power \nCorporation. Cross-ownership of generation and distribution in Luzon is often cited as a reason \nfor high electricity prices in the region. By providing a price to benchmark power rates, the \nProject is viewed as an important check on the possible abuse of market power by emerging \nvertically integrated utilities in the Visayas.  \n \n17.  A major concern in the reform process is the poor financial condition of many electric \ncooperatives. In the Philippines, they are customer-owned, nonprofit organizations. The cost \nrecovery mechanism approved for them is based on cash flow, rather than the performance-\nbased method approved for private investor-owned utilities, which considers depreciation and a \ncertain  return  on  assets.  The  rate  calculation  for  electric  cooperatives  provides  only  for \noperation and maintenance expenditure and actual debt service requirements, together with a \n5% reinvestment surplus. Funds from this reinvestment account are for capital investment in the \nnetwork. However, historically the use of these funds has not been closely monitored, and some \nof the funds may have been diverted to cover increased operating expenses.  \n \n18.  ERC recognizes the flaws in the revenue-setting regime for electric cooperatives and will \napply a performance-based, rate-setting methodology by the end of the year. In addition, to \naddress concerns about the solvency of electric cooperatives, PSALM assumed all outstanding \nobligations of electric cooperatives to NEA and other government agencies. NEA is authorized \nto guarantee the purchase of electricity by these electric cooperatives on the spot market. Also, \nNEA now offers two lending windows to support electric cooperatives: a short-term revolving \ncredit facility for shortfalls in monthly payments owed by electric cooperatives to power suppliers \nwith borrowed amounts due in 30 days, and a standby credit facility covering up to a 1 month \npayment with borrowed amounts due in 3 months.  \n \n19.  Another concern in the distribution sector is the distribution utilities' preparedness for the \nWESM and open access. The limited participation of electric cooperatives in the WESM relates \nto  practical  reasons.  Most  are  not  liquid  or  financially  viable  entities  and  have  historically \n                                                 \n5  These include 50% ownership in East Asia Utilities Corporation, which operates a 50 MW bunker C-fired plant \nwithin Mactan Export Processing Zone I; 60% ownership in Cebu Private Power Corporation, which operates a  \n70 MW bunker C-fired plant in Cebu City; and 26% effective ownership in Cebu Energy Development Corporation, \nthe project company for the 264 MW Toledo Expansion Project. The EPIRA permits distribution utilities to source \n50% of their power from affiliated companies. \n ", "6 \ninvested little in their nonpower infrastructure (in large part due to cash-flow constraints resulting \nfrom their regulatory framework). As such, many cooperatives are not able to meet the WESM\u2019s \nprudential or technical requirements. In addition, many cooperatives are more comfortable with \ntheir long-established custom of sourcing directly from NPC (rather than interacting with the \nWESM, which is seen as uncertain).  \n \n20.  The Government and international development agencies, including ADB,6 have offered \nseveral assistance programs to strengthen the management and technical capabilities of the \nelectric cooperatives. NEA is also partnering with the WESM market operator to offer capacity \nbuilding programs to the cooperatives to develop their proficiency to participate in the spot \nmarket and contract with power suppliers other than NPC. \n \n2.  Demand-Supply Balance in the Visayas \n21.  In 2008, the Visayas grid had 1,493 MW of dependable capacity (about 11% of the \ncountry's total) of which only 1,125\u20131,277 MW were supplied to the grid at any one time. Peak \nload was estimated to be 1,176 MW.7 The grid has already reached the critical period, defined \nas the year when existing capacity cannot meet peak demand plus the reserve margin required \nby ERC.8 During 2007, 54% of days had yellow alerts and 5% red alerts, indicating that reserve \nshortages were forecast even with the dispatch of all available plants. If any of the plants \nexperienced an unplanned shutdown, the entire Visayan grid would suffer power outages.  \n \n22.  Historically, the Visayas relied on its vast geothermal resources for its power needs, \nparticularly for base-load power; and built smaller diesel plants on each island for peaking \npower. It has been a net exporter to Luzon until recently, but many years of below cost-recovery \ntariffs  led  to  underinvestment  in  intermediate  and  base-load  capacity.  When  geothermal \nresources could no longer fulfil the region's rapidly growing demand (about 6-9% growth per \nyear) new generation was not brought on-line in time. The region still has untapped geothermal \nresources,  but  existing  geothermal  plants  are  only  operating  at  a  fraction  of  their  rated \ncapacities9 and new geothermal capacity is expected to come on-line very slowly relative to \ndemand growth. Moreover, the geothermal resources are concentrated in Leyte and Samar, and \ntechnical constraints make evacuation of power from these areas difficult. \n \n23.  To meet the growing electricity demand in the area, the Visayas grid will require about \n869 MW of additional capacity through to 2014. However, committed projects for the Visayas \ngrid, including this Project, offer a total of 320 MW. Indicative projects total 644 MW and include \nthe  announcement  by  Cebu  Energy  Development  Corporation 10   in  December  2007  of \n                                                 \n6  ADB.  2007.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Rural  Electric  Cooperatives \nDevelopment Project. Manila. \n7  Registered capacities, dependable capacities, and peak demand may vary slightly throughout as several sources \nprovide inconsistent information. \n8  This is 23.4% for Luzon and the Visayas, comprising 2.8% load following and frequency regulation, 10.3% spinning \nreserve, and 10.3% back-up. \n9  Philippine National Oil Company commissioned the 49 MW Northern Negros Geothermal Field and plant in \nFebruary 2007. However, at present it is producing only 7MW due to a mineral blockage in the existing wells. The \nplant was shut down in May 2008 to clear the wells, which took about 9 months. After refurbishment, the plant is \nonly be able to produce 18 MW. Leyte A (590 MW) has been operating at about 88% capacity factor and recently \nhas been below its rated capacity due to a lack of steam. \n10  A consortium comprising Global Power (footnote 8), Formosa Heavy Industries Corp. of Taiwan, Aboitiz Power \nCorp., and Vivant Power Corp., is investing an estimated $450 million for the construction of a 246 MW (3 x 82) \ncoal-fired CFB facility. \n ", "7 \nconstruction of a 246 MW (3 x 82) coal-fired power plant adjacent to an existing power plant in \nToledo, Cebu, with a target for completion of 2010.  \n \n \n24.  While a reserve margin of about 25% is considered appropriate in a well-managed \nsystem  to  assure  continuous  supply,  experience  in  the  Philippines suggests  that  a  higher \nmargin  is  needed.  This  is  particularly  applicable  in  the  Visayas  where  most  of  the  diesel \ngeneration plants are very old and the region does not have a strongly meshed transmission \nnetwork. The reserve margin in 2008 was about 50% on an installed (or nameplate) capacity \nbasis. However, taking into account the derated capacities and availability of individual plants, \nthe actual reserve margin on a dependable capacity basis was closer to 25%, yet power \noutages still occur in the Cebu, Negros, and Panay subgrid in particular. The power shortage in \nthe Visayas is projected to continue until 2011, when the Project and Global Power plants are \nexpected to come on-line. In 2011\u20132012, a slight oversupply is projected. However, since the \nProject is second in the merit order in terms of short-run marginal cost, it is expected to displace \nolder,  more  expensive  diesel  plants  and  be  fully  dispatched.  From  2013  onward,  demand \ngrowth will result in no oversupply. \n \nB.  Asian Development Bank Operations \n1.  Country Strategy \n25.  ADB's  country  strategy  and  program  for  the  Philippines  (2005\u20132007,  extended  to \n2010)11 was developed with significant input from the Government to highlight its priorities and \nkey areas for partnership. The country strategy and program lists inadequate infrastructure, \nfiscal imbalance, and uncertain investment climate as binding constraints to more rapid poverty \nreduction. The Project addresses the first area by providing much-needed base-load power \ncapacity. It addresses the second area by not putting additional strain on limited government \nfinancial resources in its attempt to achieve its goals in infrastructure investment. The Project \naddresses the third area by introducing an international sponsor that can advocate for the \ndevelopment, integrity, and transparency of the reform process.  \n \n26.  The country strategy and program also advocates more cooperation between ADB\u2019s \npublic  and  private  sector  operations  to  enhance  investor  confidence  and  promote  private \ninvestment critical to offset fiscally constrained public investment. By supporting a private sector \ninvestor, the Project is a logical continuation of the initiatives of ADB's public and private sector \noperations (Southeast Asia Regional Department and Private Sector Operations Department) in \npower  subsector  development  and  reform  that  is  designed  to  promote  an  adequate,  well-\nregulated, and market-oriented power sector.  \n \n27.  The  Project  is  also  in-line  with  ADB's  country  operations  business  plan  for  the \nPhilippines, 2009\u20132010, which calls for interventions to support critical infrastructure projects, \nincluding power generation, and cites power generation as a specific target area for private \nsector operations. \n \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2008. Country Operations Business Plan, Philippines 2009\u20132010. Manila. \n ", "8 \n2.  Long-Term Strategic Framework \n28.  Infrastructure is a core area under ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 \n(Strategy 2020).12 Infrastructure is fundamental to achieving poverty reduction and inclusive \ngrowth, and Strategy 2020 recognizes that infrastructure gaps in the Philippines have held back \nindustrialization and job creation. As part of its work in infrastructure, Strategy 2020 cites that \nADB will \"help expand the supply of energy.\" The Project falls under this core area, and follows \nthis  particular  mandate.  In  addition,  the  Project  catalyzes  private  sector  engagement  in \ninfrastructure, and thereby utilizes one of the five drivers of change13 emphasized by Strategy \n2020. \n \n3.  Energy Policy \n29.  ADB\u2019s Energy Policy14 recognizes that coal-based generation will grow to meet the \nelectricity needs of the region. It states that ADB will encourage developing member countries to \nadopt  available  cleaner  technologies,  such  as  CFB,  and  assist  them  in  collaborating  with \ndeveloped countries on technology transfer. Under the policy, ADB may support subcritical coal \ntechnology for developing member countries with small-sized grids depending on oil-based \npower supply as a least-cost option to diversify fuel sources to improve system reliability and \nenergy security. The Project complies with ADB's Energy Policy along all of these dimensions. It \nwas developed based on the intent of the governments of the Philippines and Republic of Korea \nto  cooperate  in  activities  promoting  cleaner  power  generation  to  address  projected  power \nshortages  under  a  memorandum  of  understanding  signed  in  2004.  It  will  also  decrease \ndependency on expensive and inefficient diesel plants, and increase reliability of the Visayas \ntransmission system particularly in the Cebu, Negros, and Panay subgrid. \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Project Description \n30.  The Project involves construction and operation of a 200 MW coal-fired power plant on \n100,000 square meters of land in the barangay (district) of Colon, in the city of Naga, Cebu \nProvince, about 20 km from Cebu City. The plant consists of two nominal 100 MW units (one \nunit can generate as much as 103 MW), each comprising a boiler, electrostatic precipitator for \nparticulate matter control, steam turbine generator, condenser, and circulating water system. \nThe plant will use CFB boiler technology, known as \"cleaner coal\" technology as CFB boilers \nare very low generators of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions.  \n \n31.  The project site is on the previous ash pond disposal area of the existing 203.8 MW \nNaga Power Plant, which provides easy access to transmission lines and seawater for cooling \nand industrial use, as well as joint use of existing power plant infrastructure (access road, water \nintake channel, and jetty trestle). The plant will be interconnected to the Visayas transmission \ngrid through a new 138 kilovolt substation (the New Naga Substation) located less than a \nkilometer away. KSPC contracted Doosan Heavy Industries and Construction Co., Ltd. (DHI) \nafter a competitive bidding process for plant EPC.  DHI will supply the boilers, which will be \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n13  The five drivers of change are (i) private sector development and private sector operations, (ii) good governance \nand capacity development, (iii) gender equity, (iv) knowledge solutions, and (v) partnerships. \n14 ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n ", "9 \nFoster  Wheeler  \u201cCompact\u201d  CFB  combustion  boilers.  This  boiler  model  was  first  put  into \ncommercial operation in 1993. To date, more than 40 units are in operation including more than \n16 units at 100 MW and larger, which burn a wide variety of fuels. Fuji Electric Systems Co., \nLtd.  is  designing,  manufacturing  and  supplying  the  steam  turbine  generator.  It  is  a  major \nmanufacturer of turbine generators and has shipped 450 units worldwide since 1959, totaling \nalmost 23,000 MW. Construction of the plant began in December 2007 with financing provided \nby  equity  and  bridge  loans.  As  of  May  2009,  55%  of  the  construction  milestones  were \ncompleted.  The  Project's  target  for  commercial  operation  is  February  2011  for  the  first  \n100 MW unit and May 2011 for the second 100 MW unit.  \n \n32.  The Project's feasibility study cited a preference for coal as the fuel source because \nother fuel sources were deemed either not easily or sufficiently available (hydro, biomass, \ngeothermal, natural gas) or relatively expensive (solar, wind, oil). The configuration of two  \n100 MW units was deemed optimal due to the small size and projected demand of the Visayas \ngrid.15 Subcritical technology was adopted because supercritical is technically more difficult to \napply and not cost-effective for power plants below 500 MW. However, the use of CFB boilers \nallows the Project to utilize a wide range and lower cost fuel, and results in lower nitrogen oxide \nemissions and sulfur dioxide emissions. Appendix 3 contains further explanation of the Project's \nrationale for fuel source and technology. \n \nB.  The Borrower and Sponsors \n33.  KSPC, a registered Philippines company, is 60% owned by KPHI and 40% owned by \nSPC. KPHI is a wholly owned subsidiary of KEPCO. In turn, KPHI owns 40% of SPC, giving \nKEPCO 76% effective ownership of KSPC. Both KEPCO and SPC have a long history of \noperating power plants in the Philippines. This provides added comfort not only with technical \naspects of the plant's construction and operation, but also with the sponsors' ability to contribute \nto the reform process. \n \n34.  KEPCO  is  the  Republic  of  Korea's  only  fully  integrated  electric  utility,  and  is  the \nmonopoly  operator  of  the  country's  power  transmission  and  distribution  system.  KEPCO \ngenerates  more  than  95%  of  the  electricity  consumed  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  through  \n68,000 MW of generation capacity operated by its six wholly owned generation companies, all \nseparately corporatized in April 2001. The generation sources include coal (pulverized and \nCFB),  gas  and  oil-fired  power  plants,  nuclear  power  plants,  and  hydroelectric  plants.  The \nGovernment  of  the  Republic  of  Korea,  directly  and  indirectly,  owns  51%  of  KEPCO.  The \ncompany began its foreign expansion in the Philippines and has since implemented or is in the \nprocess  of  developing  projects  in  more  than  10  countries  including  Cambodia,  Indonesia, \nMongolia, and People\u2019s Republic of China. It will provide the primary technical, managerial, and \nfinancial support to the Project.  \n \n35.  KEPCO has more than 10 years experience with power projects in the Philippines. Its \nPhilippine operations, conducted through KPHI, provide approximately 16% of Luzon's installed \ngeneration capacity or 12% of the Philippines' installed generation capacity. In 1995, KEPCO \nwas  awarded  the  rehabilitation, operation,  maintenance,  and  management  contract  for  the  \n650 MW Malaya Thermal Power Plant in Rizal. Subsequently, a consortium led by KEPCO won \nthe build-own-transfer contract for the construction of the 1,200 MW Ilijan Combined Cycle \n                                                 \n15  The largest single unit in the Visayas grid is 77.5 MW. For a grid size less than 2,000 MW and with the peak \ndemand on any one island below 600 MW, an outage of a single unit above 100 MW would cause large disruptions \nto power supply and could damage the system. \n ", "10 \nPower Plant in Batangas. In June 2004, DOE and the Korean Ministry of Commerce, Industry \nand Energy entered into a memorandum of understanding to foster cooperation between the \ntwo countries in the field of energy; promote the development of environment-friendly power \ngeneration through the use of cleaner technology; and assist the Philippines in addressing the \npower  supply  shortage  in  Cebu.  KEPCO's  participation  in  this  Project  represents  the  first \nundertaking under this memorandum of understanding. \n \n36.  SPC was organized in 1994 after a consortium led by Salcon Holdings Philippines Inc. \nwas awarded a rehabilitation, operation, maintenance, and management contract for NPC\u2019s \nNaga Power Plant Complex. In 2005, KPHI bought Salcon's shares and became the largest \nshareholder  in  SPC.  In  November  2008,  SPC  won  the  bid  for  privatization  of  the  \n146.5 MW Panay and 22 MW Bohol diesel power plants with its bid offer of $5.86 million.  \n \nC.  Development Impacts \n37.  The  Project  supports  sustainable  growth  in  the  Visayas  region  by  increasing  the \navailability of reliable and competitively priced power to help alleviate the current power supply \nshortage  without  additional  fiscal  burden  on  the  Government.  The  Project  will  revitalize \nimplementation of the Government's reform agenda for the power subsector, which aims to \nlower electricity costs over time by increasing competition and efficiency through private sector \ninvestment in the sector. The construction and operation of a plant by a large and experienced \nglobal  energy  provider  using  more  environment-friendly  technology  and  adhering  to  ADB \nsafeguards will result in the achievement of operating efficiencies that are consistent with global \nindustry best practices and more environmentally sound power generation. Moreover, it will \nprovide a demonstration effect for future greenfield power plants (particularly coal-fired) in the \nPhilippines under the new regulatory environment. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n38.  Land Lease Agreement. KSPC is the lessee under a 25-year lease of the project site, \nunder which it has an obligation to build a new power plant of at least 100 MW capacity by \nDecember 2011. KSPC has the option to extend the lease another 25 years. Upon expiration, \nall immovable assets become the property of NPC and PSALM. KSPC, NPC, PSALM, and SPC \nsigned a co-use agreement that addresses the joint use of certain existing infrastructure of the \npower plant site (access road, water intake channel, and the jetty trestle). The jetty and the jetty \nextension (a component of the Project) is located on foreshore land, which NPC will lease from \nthe Department of Environment and Natural Resources. The co-use agreement grants KSPC \naccess to the foreshore area for use of the jetty. \n \n39.  Engineering, Procurement, and Construction. The EPC contract was awarded to DHI \nthrough a qualified bidding process. DHI is part of the Doosan group, one of the oldest and \nlargest conglomerates in the Republic of Korea specializing in infrastructure support. DHI has \nbuilt over 400 nuclear, thermal, and combined cycle power plants around the world since its \nestablishment in 1962. For the Project, DHI's obligation includes constructing and testing the \nplant and transmission line, and importing all required equipment.  \n \n40.  Offtake Arrangements. KSPC's target is to contract 170 MW, or more than 91% of net \noutput. The contract period is 10 years starting from commercial operation date (COD). Under \nthe PSCs, the buyer will pay KSPC for a minimum number of kilowatt hours at the contract \nprice,  based  on  the  Project's  long-run  average  cost  adjusted  for  inflation,  the  dollar/peso \n ", "11 \nexchange  rate,  and  coal  prices.  The  PSCs  will  not  have  the  backing  of  any  government \nundertaking  since  the  EPIRA  prohibits  the  issuance  of  sovereign  guarantees  for  offtake \narrangements. The PSCs are similar and differ only in the contract quantities and capacity caps. \nERC approved the initial draft of the PSCs, and is expected to approve amendments to the \nPSCs requested by lenders. \n \n41.  KSPC  has  signed  nine  PSCs  for  a  total  contracted  capacity  of  171.1  MW.  The \ndistribution utilities are primarily in central Negros and Cebu provinces. In addition to the eight \nelectric cooperatives, KSPC has contracted 15 MW with Mactan Electric Company, a private \ninvestor-owned utility, and 37 MW with iN2Power, a newly formed wholesale power aggregator \nthat combines supply from generators to match the full load profile (base load, intermediate, \npeak) of energy buyers. \n \n \nTable 3: Data on Electric Cooperatives \n(figures for 2007 unless indicated otherwise) \n \nItem CEBECO I CEBECO II CENECO NOCECO NORECO 1 NORECO II VRESCO\nNEA rating  A+ A+ A+ A+ (2004) A+ A+ (2006) A+\nCustomers (number) 108,801 101,290 156,317 118,861 48,411 104,323 88,989\nHousehold Level of Electrification 42% 57% 71% 87% 31% 53% 46%\nOperating revenue (P million) 536 775 2,506 782 203 931 686\nOperating margin (P) 35,280,819 17,277,722 76,290,057 47,749,994 (322,141) 26,581,686 11,253,915\nNet margin (P) 7,176,756 1,045,809 (41,111,512) 7,149,974 (8,125,393) 908,575 (16,185,864)\nOperating margin 2006 (P) (31,983,386) 8,921,658 35,561,697 33,479,069 (6,297,036) 17,627,594 (2,922,924)\nNet margin 2006 (P) (60,257,080) (9,835,314) (77,415,951) 14,674,362 (7,214,706) 713,285 (26,259,400)\nActual kWh purchased 107,612,696 165,324,916 553,771,302 150,003,728 39,665,053 190,609,205 137,036,965\nKSPC volume from the project (kW) 7,000 12,000 64,000 10,000 2,700 16,400 7,000\nActual peak load (kW)  21,967 36,709 107,063 31,210 9,020 38,190 27,062\nKSPC volume % of peak load 32% 33% 60% 32% 30% 43% 26%\nActual power supply cost 3.85 3.77 3.75 3.87 3.91 3.80 3.76\nLoad factor 56% 51% 59% 55% 50% 57% 58%\nSystem loss  9% 10% 12% 11% 14% 12% 14%\nNumber of employees 201 226 367 338 184 300 277\n( ) = negative, kW = kilowatt, kWh = kilowatt-hour, CEBECO I = Cebu I Electric Cooperative Inc., CEBECO II = Cebu II \nElectric  Cooperative  Inc.,  CENECO  =  Central  Negros  Electric  Cooperative,  Inc.,  NEA  =  National  Electrification \nAdministration,  NOCECO  =  Negros  Occidental  Electric  Cooperative  Inc.,  NORECO  I  =  Negros  Oriental  I  Electric \nCooperative Inc., NORECO II = Negros Oriental II Electric Cooperative Inc., VRESCO = VMC Rural Electric Service \nCooperative, Inc.  \nNote: NEA ratings are based on a point system to measure an electric cooperative's financial viability and performance. \nAreas of consideration include payment history of NEA loans, system loss, collection efficiency, payment history to \npower suppliers and TransCo or NGCP, nonpower cost, amount of energization, and financial results.

Any capacity not contracted over the life of the Project will be sold on a merchant basis \nto the WESM. If the WESM is not launched by the Project's COD, KSPC will sell any excess \nand unnominated power through the Visayas Supply Augmentation Auction Program, to NGCP \nto serve as ancillary services, or on an ad-hoc basis to large customers connected directly to \nthe grid. \n \n ", "12 \n43.  Coal  Supply.  Fuel is low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal supplied to the Project under  \ncoal supply contracts with two Indonesian coal companies selected after screening potential \nsuppliers and several rounds of negotiations. KSPC has also entered into backup coal supply \narrangements with Philippine National Oil Company-Exploration Corporation. \n \n44.  Transmission. KSPC and NGCP will enter into a transmission service agreement for \nthe transmission of electricity generated by the Project. In addition, KSPC is obliged, under \nmemorandum of understanding, to construct and cover the cost of the transmission line to \nconnect the power plant to the new Naga Substation (0.7 km), and turn it over to TransCo upon \ncompletion. In turn, NGCP will provide engineering and right-of-way acquisition services for the \nassociated line. NGCP will build a new Naga substation at its own cost to enable the full \ndispatch of the Project's power. If the substation is not completed by the time the plant is ready \nfor commissioning, NGCP will implement a contingency plan and bear the costs for building a \ntemporary line to the old Naga Substation. \n \n45.  Operation and Maintenance. KSPC will contract operation and maintenance to East-\nWest Power, one of KEPCO's six generation companies. East-West Power has experienced \noperating power plants overseas. In addition to daily operation and maintenance of the plant, \nEast-West  Power  will  be  responsible  for  security,  safety,  hiring  and  training  of  personnel, \nenvironmental compliance, procurement of consumables and spares, and major maintenance. \nMajor overhauls, intermediate overhauls, and preventive maintenance will follow an alternate \ncycle between units to minimize plant outages and smooth maintenance expenditures.  \n \nE.  Environmental and Social Dimensions \n1.  Environment \n46.  The emissions guaranteed in the EPC contract are below Philippine standards and \nWorld  Bank  guidelines  for  all  pollutants.  CFB  combustion  boilers  are  inherently  very  low \ngenerators of nitrous oxide emissions due to their low combustion temperature and staged \ncombustion, and are capable of removing up to 98% of sulfur dioxide emissions. \n \nTable 4: Comparison of Project Emission Requirements with World Bank and Philippine \nRequirements \nPollutant  World Bank Standard a  Philippine Standardb   Project Requirement \nParticulate  40 mg/Nm3 (@ 12% CO  \n50 mg/Nm3  150 mg/Nm3  2\nMatter  dry) \n0.2 tons/day/MWe   200 ppm (@ 6% O  dry) \nSO   700 (245 ppm)  2\n2 2,000 mg/Nm3  (approx. 572 mg/Nm3)  \nCO  \u2014  500 mg/Nm3  320 ppm (@ 6% O  dry) \n2\n150 ppm (@ 6% O  dry) \nNO   750 mg/Nm3  1,000 (487 ppm)  2\nX (approx. 308 mg/Nm3) \nCO = carbon monoxide, NO = nitrogen oxides, SO = sulfur dioxide, mg/Nm3 = milligrams per normal cubic, \nX   2  \nMWe = megawatts of electrical output, ppm = parts per million. \na World Bank Group. 1998.

Total carbon dioxide emission of KSPC's Cebu power plant is 1,006,148  tons of carbon \ndioxide/year.  The  Philippines  nearly  doubled  its  total  carbon  dioxide  emissions  to  \n80.5 million tons in 2004 from 43.9 million tons in 1991. However, the Philippines' share of the \ntotal world emission of carbon dioxide remains small. The Philippines accounts for only 0.3% of \nglobal carbon dioxide emissions although it comprised 1.3% of the world's population in 2004. \n \n48.  The Project is classified as category A under ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). The \nenvironmental impacts were assessed and the Government approved the environmental impact \nassessment  on  5  December  2005.  The  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  was \nprepared and, in accordance with ADB's Public Communications Policy (2005), disclosed to the \npublic through the ADB website on 10 March 2009. \n \n49.  The environment management plan (EMP) is part of the Project\u2019s environmental impact \nassessment and outlines measures to be implemented during construction and operation of the \nProject to mitigate air pollution, noise, waste generation (liquid effluents, thermal pollution, and \nash), water quality deterioration, and traffic. The EMP also outlines a monitoring program that \nwill involve continuous emissions monitoring; installation of equipment to monitor wastewater \nquality; and ambient air quality monitoring systems to measure sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, \nand dust content in the immediate vicinity of the plant. Annual environmental audits will be \nundertaken by a third party duly accredited by the Department of Environment and Natural \nResources.  A  multipartite  monitoring  team  was  established  comprising  contractors,  local \nconsultants, and officials of relevant government agencies and local government units that will \nbe  responsible  for  overseeing  monitoring  activities.  KSPC  has  allocated  funds  for  EMP \nimplementation. Results of environmental due diligence indicate that the mitigating measures \nidentified in the environmental impact assessment and EMP, including environmental monitoring \nduring construction, are being properly implemented with no adverse or detrimental effect on the \nenvironment. The construction of the 0.7 km transmission line will not cause any significant \nenvironmental  impact  and  will  not  cross  any  environmentally  sensitive  areas.  Ash  will  be \ndisposed as raw material for cement manufacturing through agreement with Cebu Provincial \nGovernment (CPG). In emergencies, ash will be transferred from the silo in a humidified form \nand stored in the emergency ash pond on-site, lined with high density polyethylene (HDPE) to \nensure no ground seepage of the wet ash. In the event that alternative ash disposal is needed \nin  the  future,  any  proposed  site  will  be  required  to  meet  ADB's  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards requirements and approval. \n \n50.  Due diligence of the Project's environment-related activities confirms that the Project \nmeets ADB's environmental requirements as well as national and local requirements. Site visits \nindicate that adequate environment, health, and safety management systems are in place. \nImplementation of the EMP during operation should ensure that any adverse or significant \nimpacts will be adequately addressed. \n \n2.  Social Aspects \n51.  Labor,  Health,  and  Safety.  The  Project  will  provide  employment  opportunities  for \nqualified local residents, and contribute directly and indirectly to business opportunities in the \narea. Antipollution technology and devices will be installed to prevent air pollutants from going \ninto nearby communities. KSPC will monitor the health of local communities, contribute to the \nimprovement of local health services and facilities, and conduct periodic medical missions that \nwill distribute free medicines. \n \n ", "14 \n52.  Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement. Due diligence was conducted on the \nNaga land (the plant site), which used to be occupied by 22 families with no legal title. In \nOctober 2008, 17 families voluntarily relocated to a site provided by the Naga local government. \nKSPC provided financial assistance and the labor force needed to construct homes for the \nrelocated families. KSPC also provided basic infrastructure and utilities at the relocation site, \nsuch as new access roads, and power and water supplies. The remaining 5 families claim to \nhave legal titles and have partially encroached on the leased land. While awaiting a judicial \nresolution, the disputed areas have been fenced off from the rest of the plant site and the \nfamilies remain unaffected. Due diligence confirms that no other issues relate to those affected \nby the construction of the KSPC plant on the Naga land. In the event of any unforeseen land \nacquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement  impacts,  KSPC  will  comply  with  ADB's  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy.  \n \n53.  The Project will evacuate power to a 138-kilovolt transmission line requiring land and \nright-of-way acquisition; TransCo prepared a land acquisition and resettlement plan. The KSPC \ntransmission line (the project transmission line) extends 0.7 km and connects to the NGCP line. \nAcquisition of public and private land for the project transmission line will affect assets of people \nliving close to the project site, hence the overall project category is \"B\" with respect to ADB's \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995). A short resettlement plan for this project component \nwas prepared as part of the main land acquisition and resettlement plan. Activities under the \nshort resettlement plan will mitigate adverse social and economic impacts from land acquisition, \nand establish an ongoing relationship with those affected throughout the life of the Project. \n \n54.  Community  Engagement.  KSPC  implements  projects  and  activities  to  establish  a \nharmonious relationship with the host community through its social development plan and its \ncorporate social responsibility policy. The social development plan covers KSPC interventions \nand donations in areas such as health, sanitation, nutrition, and education to support programs \nby the local government unit that favor various project stakeholders. An annual budget of \nP240,000 is allocated for implementation. The recipients of KSPC's community programs are \nresidents of Colon barangay and include the relocated families. Moreover, the local government \nunit will benefit directly from the Project through additional financial resources provided by \nSection 289 of the Local Government Code and Energy Regulations 1-94 from DOE. KSPC will \nassist the municipality in obtaining the funds provided by these codes. \n \n55.  Indigenous People. No indigenous people live in Naga City. Most of the households in \nthe city classify themselves as Cebuano. No indigenous people will be affected by the Project; \nhence, the Project is categorized as C under ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \n \n \n \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \nA.  Loan \n56.  ADB will provide a direct loan of up to $120,000,000 to KSPC without government \nguarantee from ADB's ordinary capital resources.  \n \n ", "15 \nB.  Justification \n57.  The Project merits ADB support for the following reasons:  \n \n(i)  The Project will provide much needed electricity to an economically promising \narea of the Philippines with a current power shortage, and will thereby support \nthe country\u2019s continued growth and contribute to reduced poverty in the region.  \n(ii)  The Project is directly in-line with the Government's road map for the energy \nsector under the Philippine Energy Plan for 2005\u20132014.16 By demonstrating that \na  greenfield  project  can  be  successfully  financed  and  operated  in  light  of \nimminent market-oriented sector reforms, the Project will provided much-needed \nsupport for the Government's reform agenda. By addressing the region's power \nsupply shortage, the Project will catalyze the pace of reform as set out by the \nEPIRA, which has stalled due to the assumption that launching the WESM during \na shortage would result in politically untenable spot prices. \n(iii)  The Project will have a demonstration effect for future private sector investments \nin greenfield coal-fired power generation under the new regulatory regime. The \nProject,  through  the  expertise  of  its  sponsors  and  compliance  with  ADB \nsafeguards, will be a model in the application of cleaner technologies to coal-fired \npower plants of this size. Moreover, the finance structures used for the Project \ncan serve as a model to finance future greenfield coal projects. \n(iv)  ADB's  country  strategy  for  the  Philippines  (2005\u20132007)  lists  inadequate \ninfrastructure,  fiscal  imbalance,  and  uncertain  investment  climate  as  binding \nconstraints to more rapid poverty reduction. The Project addresses the first area \nby providing much-needed base-load power capacity, and the second area by \nnot adding strain to the limited financial resources of the Government. ADB's \nparticipation will give added assurance to investors and cofinanciers that the \nGovernment will more likely support this Project throughout its life due to ADB's \ninvolvement, and thereby improve the sector's uncertain investment climate. \n(v)  The  Project  is  in-line  with  ADB's  country  operations  business  plan  for  the \nPhilippines, 2009\u20132010, which calls for interventions designed to support critical \ninfrastructure projects including power generation, and cites power generation as \na specific target area for private sector operations. \n(vi)  By supporting a private sector investor, the Project is a logical continuation of the \ninitiatives of ADB's public and private sector operations (Southeast Asia Regional \nDepartment  and  Private  Sector  Operations  Department)  in  development  and \nreform of the power subsector that is designed to support an adequate and well-\nregulated market-oriented sector. Specifically, ADB's support for KEPCO and \nSPC's  first  merchant  power  plant  will  improve  the  competitiveness  of  the \ngeneration sector by reducing its oligopolistic structure. These sponsors are likely \nto contribute to the development and viability of the wholesale electricity market \nand  the  integrity  of  the  reform  process.  In  time,  the  improved  competitive \nenvironment is expected to result in more affordable and sustainable electricity \ntariffs that could stimulate economic activity and reduce poverty. \n(vii)  The Project falls under one of the mandates of Strategy 2020, which cites that \nADB will \"help expand the supply of energy\" as part of its work in infrastructure, a \ncore  area  under  ADB's  long-term  strategy.  Infrastructure  is  fundamental  to \nachieving poverty reduction and inclusive growth, and Strategy 2020 recognizes \nthat  infrastructure  gaps  in  the  Philippines  specifically  have  held  back \n                                                 \n16 Department of Energy, Philippines. 2005.

In addition, the Project catalyzes private sector \nengagement  in  infrastructure,  and  thereby  utilizes  one  of  the  four  drivers  of \nchange emphasized by Strategy 2020. \n(viii)  The  Project  complies  with  ADB's  Energy  Policy.  It  will  adopt  CFB,  a  more \nenvironment-friendly technology, and will improve system reliability and energy \nsecurity through diversification away from oil-based generation in the context of a \nsmaller  size  grid.  Due  diligence  confirms  that  coal-based  generation  using \nsubcritical boiler technology is the least-cost option, and that adequate mitigation \nequipment and measures are incorporated in the project design. \n(ix)  ADB's participation is needed to fill a gap in the present financial environment in \nwhich sources of funding previously available have abated due to outside market \nfactors and the exposure limits of banks to the Project's sector.  \n(x)  KEXIM  brought  the  Project  to  ADB's  attention  based  on  the  signing  of  a \nmemorandum  of  understanding  by  ADB  and  KEXIM  in  June  2008  for \nnonsovereign  financing  under  the  Asian  Infrastructure  Financing  Initiative. \nCooperation and cofinancing with bilaterals is a key agenda item promoted under \nADB's recent general capital increase. If approved, the Project will represent the \nfirst collaboration between ADB and KEXIM under this initiative. \n \nC.  Anticorruption and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n58.  Integrity checklists were completed for KEPCO, the shareholding companies (KPHI and \nSPC), and their management, based on internet searches, press reviews, and use of the World \nCheck  database.  No  issues  or  concerns  were  found.  KSPC  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and policy relating to the Combating of Money \nLaundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require KSPC to institute, maintain, and \ncomply with internal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for \nthe purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism \nand  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  The  investment \ndocumentation between ADB and KSPC will further allow ADB to investigate any violation or \npotential violation of these undertakings. \n \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n59.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 17   the \nGovernment will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance to \nKSPC. No funding will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. ADB will enter into \nsuitable documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the \nproposed financing by ADB Board of Directors. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 1966.

Electricity prices in the Philippines are among the highest in Asia. They reflect distortions \nfrom  high-priced  take-or-pay  contracts  that  National  Power  Corporation  (NPC)  signed  with \nindependent power producers (IPPs) in the early 1990s to alleviate the country\u2019s power crisis. \nHowever  the  Asian  financial  crisis  suppressed  economic  growth  and  reduced  electricity \ndemand, leading to a significant surplus of power-generating capacity, especially in Luzon. As a \nresult NPC became heavily indebted and could not adequately maintain its own plants.  \n \n2.  To reduce public debt, improve efficiency in the sector, and encourage competition to \nbring down the cost of electricity, the Government embarked on a market-oriented reform \nprogram. The restructuring program is progressing steadily to meet its targets, although much \nlater than originally planned. The reform plan embodied in the Electric Power Industry Reform \nAct of 2001 (EPIRA) mandated a radical restructuring and includes the following actions: \n \n(i)  separate the transmission and generation functions and unbundle power rates; \n(ii)  create  the  Power  Sector  Assets  and  Liabilities  Management  Corporation \n(PSALM) to take ownership of and manage the orderly privatization of NPC \ngeneration and transmission assets and the power purchase agreements with \nprivate IPPs; \n(iii)  create a wholesale electricity spot market (WESM) where all energy generated is \ntraded between generators and distribution utilities or retailers; \n(iv)  mandate  the  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (ERC)  to  replace  the  Energy \nRegulatory Board as the industry's independent regulator; and \n(v)  introduce competition in the retail supply of electricity (open access), subject to \ncertain conditions, starting with large electricity users and eventually extending to \nthe supply of electricity to households. Among the conditions are privatization of \nat  least  70%  of  the  total  capacity  (or  4,336  megawatts  [MW])  of  the  NPC \ngeneration assets in Luzon and the Visayas, and transfer of management and \ncontrol of at least 70% of the IPPs to independent IPP administrators. \n \n3.  Unbundling. Rates were unbundled into four components on consumers' electricity bills: \n(i)  generation,  (ii)  transmission,  (iii)  distribution,  and  (iv)  the  universal  charge.  Generation \ncharges are passed through based on the blended weighted average of a distribution utility's \nsources of power supply. For generation based on bilateral contracts, ERC must approve the \nunderlying contracts. The approval process includes public hearings where consumers from the \ndistribution utility's franchise may raise objections. Generation purchased from the spot market \nis based on WESM prices. Transmission charges are also passed through based on ERC \napproval of the capital budget of the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) for \nevery 5-year regulatory period, the second of which spans 2006\u20132010. The universal charge is \ncollected  for  specific  purposes  including  missionary  electrification,  environmental  charges, \npayment of NPC\u2019s stranded debt and costs,1 and payment of distribution utilities\u2019 stranded \ncosts. This charge is collected by distribution utilities as a pass-through charge.  \n \n                                                 \n1  EPIRA permits NPC, PSALM, and distribution utilities to recover, through a universal charge, costs associated with \ntheir take-or-pay contracts by the Energy Regulatory Board as of 31 December 2000. These costs take two forms: \nstranded debt and stranded costs. Stranded debt refers to unpaid obligations of NPC, while stranded cost is the \ndifference between the NPC-contracted purchase price and the actual price at which electricity was sold. The \namount of stranded debt and costs that NPC or PSALM would seek to recover would depend on several factors \nincluding the proceeds from the privatization program. The imposition of the stranded cost charges on customers \nwithin the universal charge, and the period of such imposition, will require ERC approval. \n ", "Appendix 2     21 \n4.  Privatization. In 2001, NPC's transmission assets were spun off to the state-owned \nNational Transmission Corporation (TransCo) to assume the electrical transmission functions of \nNPC until privatization. After three failed attempts, PSALM held a fourth round of bidding in \nDecember 2007 to privatize the operation of the country's power transmission system under a \n25-year  concession.  Two  bidders  participated  and  a  consortium  comprising  State  Grid \nCorporation of China2 and two local companies, Monte Oro Grid Resources Corp. and Calaca \nHigh Power Corp, won with its bid of $3.95 billion. The concession contract was awarded on 1 \nDecember 2007 and after NGCP obtained the necessary congressional franchise, it took over \noperations on 15 January 2009. NGCP will assume all of TransCo's obligations to the Project, \nincluding construction of the New Naga Substation and engineering services for the associated \ntransmission line connecting the substation to the Project.  \n \n5.  NGCP manages the central dispatch of power with the aim to ensure safety, power \nquality, stability, reliability, and security of the transmission grid. As the system operator it \nschedules enough power generation to meet expected power demand throughout the day with \nadequate  reserve  margins  for  contingencies,  and  arranges  for  the  provision  of  ancillary \nservices. For grids without the WESM, NGCP prepares and implements the generation dispatch \nschedules. For grids with the WESM, the system WESM operator is part of NGCP and provides \nreal-time system information to the market operator. The market operator then provides NGCP \nwith a generation dispatch schedule according to bids submitted by the generation participants. \nAll energy, including quantities sold through bilateral contracts, is dispatched by the system \noperator. \n \n6.  As of 31 May 2009, 16 of NPC's power plants with a total capacity of 2,168 MW in Luzon \nand the Visayas had been sold and turned over. This represents about 58% of the operating \ncapacity in Luzon the Visayas that can be counted toward the 70% needed to declare open \naccess. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) supported privatization of the 600 MW Masinloc \ncoal-fired thermal power plant bought by AES Corporation of the United States, the largest \nasset that has been turned over to date, and is considering support for the purchase of the 748 \nMW  Tiwi-MakBan  geothermal  power  project,  which  was  turned  over  in  May  2009.  The \nprivatization process experienced a setback when Suez-Tractabel S.A. backed out of the sale of \nthe Calaca coal\u2013fired thermal power plant because the power plant had deteriorated since its \nbidding date in October 2007.3 PSALM entered into a negotiated bid for Calaca and reawarded \nthe plant in July 20094. PSALM is targeting to reach the 70% privatization threshold by 2010. \n \n7.  Under  the  EPIRA's  directive,  PSALM  launched  its  first  attempt  to  appoint,  in  a \ncompetitive bidding process, IPP administrators to manage NPC\u2019s contracted capacity. The \nadministrators will make a monthly payment to NPC and assume NPC's obligations to source \nfuel and manage the sale of the power from the IPPs, including bidding on the WESM and \nbilateral contracting. The IPP administrators will operate independently of PSALM to minimize \nopportunities for collusion. The first IPP administrator bid was announced in October 2008 for \n                                                 \n2  State Grid of China owns 40% of NGCP and operates the national transmission system of the People's Republic of \nChina (PRC). Its transmission, distribution, and other assets cover 88% of the national territory and it is the PRC's \nsecond largest state-owned enterprise and the largest utility in the world. Its participation in NGCP is expected to \ngreatly improve the reliability and efficiency of the Philippines' grid. \n3  The ADB Board of Directors approved ADB's participation in the financing for the Calaca project in February 2008, \nbut no financing agreements were signed for this project. In July 2009, PSALM successfully re-bid the Calaca plant \nfor $362 million. The winning bidder is DMCI Holdings Inc. When turned over, NPC and PSALM will have privatized \n74% of its generation assets in Luzon and Visayas. \n4  PSALM successfully re-bid the Calaca plant for $362 million.

Wholesale  Electricity  Spot  Market.  The  Philippine  Electricity  Market  Corporation \n(PEMC) launched the WESM in Luzon in June 2006 and functions as the market operator. The \nWESM is a mandatory gross-offer pool with net bilateral settlement and nodal marginal pricing. \nAll generators are required to offer into the market but may settle bilateral contracts that are \nregistered with the market operator directly with energy buyers. Spot market volume in 2008 \nwas 4,927 gigawatt-hours (GWh) representing 14% on average of total volume in the system, \nand the cumulative average price was P4,770/megawatt-hour (MWh). Year to date, about 23% \nof power is being bought on the WESM. According to a World Bank-sponsored study,5 some \ndysfunctional aspects of the WESM market rules could create distortions or inefficiencies in the \npricing signals for investors.6 However, many industry analysts believe the WESM has been \ngenerally operating satisfactorily since its commercial launch.  \n \n9.  The study also drew several conclusions regarding the readiness of various participants \nfor the launch of WESM in the Visayas based on interviews and a review of the trial operations. \nIn summary, PEMC as the market operator is prepared, but NGCP as the system operator was \nconsidered understaffed and not fully prepared to operate in a market context. The generators \nhad submitted market offers and tested the market systems but were not fully prepared to \noperate in the market. The electric cooperatives were not ready to operate in a market context \nand many had not even registered and participated in trial operations. The study also predicted \nvery high prices should the WESM be launched in the current demand\u2013supply situation, which \ncould cause political problems.  \n \n10.  The EPIRA mandates procurement of at least 10% from the market for distribution \nutilities for the first 5 years from the establishment of the WESM. In Luzon, PEMC targeted 45 \ndistribution utilities to participate in the WESM but only 14 are now members. The majority of \ndistribution utilities fulfill the requirement through generators that buy power from the WESM on \ntheir behalf. WESM participation also requires a prudential deposit in cash or letter-of-credit \nbased on a distribution utility\u2019s net exposure to the WESM. PEMC is partnering with the National \nElectrification Administration (NEA) to offer capacity building programs to electric cooperatives \nto develop their proficiency to contract with power suppliers other than NPC and to participating \nin the spot market. NEA will also offer to guarantee the purchase of electricity by the electric \ncooperatives to help them meet the 10% requirement; the guarantee will be conditioned on \nparticipation in capacity building programs.  \n \n11.  In December 2007, PEMC obtained approval to launch the WESM in the Visayas in \n2008, but the Department of Energy overturned this decision because it was likely to result in \nhigh WESM prices in the Cebu, Negros, and Panay subgrid due to tightened supply conditions. \nTo stabilize supply, the Department of Energy directed implementation of the Visayas Supply \nAugmentation Auction Program in January 2009, to be administered by PEMC and NGCP. The \n                                                 \n5  Intelligent Energy Systems. 2008. Technical Assistance on WESM Policy Development. Report to the DOE. Final \nReport: Extension of WESM to Visayas. Manila. \n6  For example, a significant number of trading intervals have spot prices at or below zero, implying that generators \nare bidding below their short-run marginal costs in order to get dispatched. This may be due to generators having \ntake-or-pay fuel contracts in addition to the market procedures on the management of generation minimum load. \nHowever, traders or generators may try to make up for zero prices by bidding very high prices during peak, which \nmakes WESM prices more volatile. Transmission constraints have also shown weaknesses in the WESM's pricing \ndetermination methodology. However, ERC recently approved a method, proposed by PEMC, to address such \nsituations.  \n ", "Appendix 2     23 \nVisayas Supply Augmentation Auction Program is a day-ahead market that allows (i) entities \nthat have their own power supply (embedded generators) to use their own generators and sell \nthat capacity and (ii) grid-connected customers to sell an interruptible portion of their loads \nthrough  an  auction  process.  This  is  a  form  of  demand  management  as  it  would  allow \nparticipants to manage their loads as well as to run their self-generation facilities, as means to \nease the supply deficit and augment supply in the region. PEMC believes that the Visayas \nSupply Augmentation Auction Program can add as much as 137 MW to supply the grid. \n \n12.  Regulation by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC). ERC's functions include  \n(i) developing and enforcing technical standards for transmission and distribution; (ii) licensing \nsuppliers of electricity, including generators and power aggregators; (iii) preventing abuse of \nmarket power and anticompetitive or discriminatory behavior; (iv) resolving disputes between \nparticipants in the sector; and (v) setting rates for noncontestable sectors of the industry. At \npresent the noncontestable sectors are transmission, distribution, and generation. Generation \nwill become contestable with the onset of open access and retail competition. ERC reviews and \napproves the terms and conditions of bilateral contracts between generators and franchised \ndistribution utilities. Once approved, the generation rate is a pass-through by the distribution \nutility to its customers. ERC approves the WESM\u2019s pricing methodologies and oversees its \nimplementation by the market operator. \n \n13.  ERC is widely viewed by industry participants as having the intent to be transparent and \nnonpolitical, but lacking the human resources to conduct rulings efficiently and reasonably. To \naddress these concerns and move the reform program forward, ADB has provided a loan and \ntechnical assistance7 to the Philippines to support ERC\u2019s ability to, among others, (i) respond \nefficiently and fairly to market issues, and (ii) communicate all regulatory matters clearly and \neffectively to the public and stakeholders.  \n \n14.  Open  Access.  Section  31  of  the  EPIRA  provides  for  the  establishment  of  retail \ncompetition and open access to distribution networks, subject to five conditions: \n \n(i)  establishment of the WESM, \n(ii)  approval of unbundled transmission and distribution wheeling charges, \n(iii)  initial implementation of the cross-subsidy removal scheme, \n(iv)  privatization of at least 70% of the total capacity of NPC generating assets in \nLuzon and the Visayas, and \n(v)  transfer of the management and control of at least 70% of the total energy output \nof power plants under contract with NPC to the IPP administrators. \n \n15.  In Resolution 3-2007, ERC set out the timeline for open access to distribution networks \nand implementation of retail competition. According to the resolution, retail competition will \ncommence upon fulfillment of the five preconditions of the EPIRA\u2019s section 31 and of two other \n\u201cvital requirements\u201d: establishment of necessary infrastructure (such as a customer switching \nsystem) and promulgation of pertinent regulations. Once all of these conditions are met, ERC \nwill give 6 months notice before open access and retail competition commences within the \nLuzon grid; this will include the franchise areas of both private utilities and electric cooperatives. \nRetail competition will begin with end-users with an average peak demand of 1 MW.  \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n ", "24     Appendix 2 \n16.  After 2 years, the second phase of retail competition will begin with the threshold of \ncontestability going down to 750 kW, for both single and aggregated loads. Thereafter, the \nthreshold  will  go  down  gradually  until  it  reaches  households  (within  7  years  following \ncommencement of the second phase of retail competition, a maximum of 9.5 years in total from \nthe original ERC notice). \n \n17.  ERC cannot set a definitive timetable due to uncertainty from PSALM on the timing of \nreaching the privatization targets. In response to political concerns about electricity prices, \nindustrial  and  other  large  power  consumers  have  requested  that  implementation  of  retail \ncompetition and open access be accelerated within the framework of the EPIRA. A number of \nindustry participants, comprising IPPs and investor-owned distribution companies, petitioned \nERC to make an order to allow interim open access to come into effect for large power users. \nThese applicants argued that although EPIRA preconditions have not yet been met, making \nsuch an order would be consistent with the EPIRA\u2019s policy intent. On the other hand, others are \nconcerned that interim access may negate the will of the Government to follow through with its \nprivatization targets and hence continue to have undue influence on the market. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 3     25 \nRATIONALE FOR ADOPTION OF FUEL TYPE AND TECHNOLOGY \n \n1.  In June 2004, the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Energy of the Republic of Korea \nand the Department of Energy of the Philippines signed a memorandum of understanding to \nfoster cooperation between the two countries in addressing the projected power supply shortage \nin  Cebu,  and  to  promote  utilization  of  technology  for  more  environment-friendly  power \ngeneration. Later that year, the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) and the SPC Power \nCorporation  (SPC)  worked  jointly  to  support  a  feasibility  study  that  resulted  in  a \nrecommendation to construct a 200-megawatt (MW) coal-fired power plant on the island of \nCebu, utilizing circulating fluidized bed (CFB) combustion technology, in an area adjacent to \nSPC's Naga Power Plant Complex (the Project). In determining the optimal location and fuel \nsupply for the Project, the study took into account the unique configuration of the Visaya's \ntransmission grid and the availability of other fuel sources, including indigenous renewable \nresources such as geothermal. After determining coal to be the optimal fuel type, the study \nconsidered subcritical CFB technology to be the most effective from the viewpoint of the plant's \nsize, coal characteristics, environmental regulation, and cost. \n \nA.  Considerations for Location \n \n2.  The Philippines is the world's second largest user of geothermal energy for power \ngeneration with 1,958 MW accounting for 12% of the country's total installed capacity. The \ncontinued development of geothermal energy as an economically competitive and environment-\nfriendly resource remains a Government priority. Almost 50% of the Philippines total geothermal \ncapacity is located in the Visayas (723 MW in Leyte and 242 MW in Negros). Total geothermal \npotential  in  the  Visayas  is  estimated  at  1,619  MW  constituting  42%  of  the  country's  total \ngeothermal reserves. However, existing geothermal plants are only operating at a fraction of \ntheir rated capacities1 and new geothermal capacity is expected to come on-line very slowly \nrelative to demand growth. Even accounting for the new geothermal capacity expected, the \nDepartment of Energy has identified a need for additional base-load generation in Cebu.2 \n \n3.  Historically the majority of electric power produced by geothermal plants in Leyte was \nsupplied  to  the  Luzon  Grid  as  the  demand  for  power  in  the  Visayas  was  less  than  the \ngeothermal power generation available. However, as energy demand grew in the Visayas in \nrecent years, the situation has reversed. The Visayas may become a net importer this year as \nthe demand\u2013supply balance reaches critical levels and additional capacity (and refurbishments) \nare brought on-line in Luzon. \n \n4.  Figure A3 shows the flow of power through the grid at 19:00 hours on 24 March 2009, \none of the highest peak hours for demand this year. Demand on the grid was 1,166 MW, while \ntotal available capacity was 1,222 MW. To make up for demand and line losses, 27 MW of \npower had to be imported from Luzon. Cebu represents 45% of total Visayas demand, but only \n25% of the total capacity. Cebu had the highest power deficit (214 MW). Panay and Bohol face \nthe most potential line losses due to their position at the end of the grid. The figure also \n                                                 \n1  Geothermal plants have not been operating at full capacity due to instability and declines in steam supply and other \ntechnical constraints such as mineral blockage of wells. \n2  This outcome was confirmed in the model constructed by the lenders' market consultant for project supply and \ndemand. The model assumes the following additions to geothermal capacity: PNOC-EDC's 20 MW Nasulo \nGeothermal Project in Negros in 2010, 40 MW Dauin Geothermal Project in Negros in 2012, and 100 MW Cabalian \nGeothermal Project in Leyte in 2015. The model also assumes additional wells are drilled to offset the natural \ndecline in performance of existing wells, so the capacity factor of geothermal plants remains at 60%\u201380%. Even \nso, the model shows that coal projects are a necessary supplement to provide adequate supply.   \n ", "26     Appendix 3 \nhighlights the vulnerability of the grid, particularly in the Cebu-Negros-Panay region, since none \nof the interconnections are managed on an N-1 basis.3 If a submarine cable goes down or its \ncapacity is reduced, or if a large power station is on outage up the supply chain, it could easily \ndisrupt power in all three islands. For this reason, the Department of Energy advocates building \nmore capacity in Cebu, Negros, and Panay to enhance each island's energy security. Adding \nplants on Cebu Island in particular will help increase reliability of power to the region's largest \nload center (metro Cebu City), as well as to Negros and Panay. \n \n \n \nFigure A3: Visayas Interconnection Power Flow, MW at 1900H March 24, 2009 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n  Source: National Grid Corporation of the Philippines. \n \n \n5.  Adding capacity to submarine interconnectors in the Visayas grid is not viewed as an \noptimal or efficient solution to the power crisis in this region. Submarine cables are very costly, \nand most of the geothermal capacity on Leyte and Samar is already being evacuated through \nexisting interconnectors or consumed locally. Relying on such a solution also involves technical \nissues such as high line losses and difficulties in regulating voltage over long distances. The \ntechnical vulnerability of the grid would remain high. Management personnel from the National \nGrid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) warn against \"applying a transmission solution to a \ngeneration problem.\"  \n \n6.  Nonetheless, NGCP has a number of projects under way to upgrade the submarine \ncables  interconnecting  the  Visayas  islands.  Ongoing  is  the  Negros\u2013Panay  Interconnection \nuprating to add another 100 MW to the existing 100 MW capacity (peak limit 76\u201385 MW), which \nwill optimize the utilization of indigenous power coming from geothermal capacity additions in \n                                                 \n3  The N\u20131 rule states that during the outage of any single transmission element of the power system, the following \nconditions must be simultaneously met: (i) no transmission elements are overloaded, (ii) bus voltages are within \nallowable limits, (iii) the remaining generators stay in synchronism after a disturbance, and (iv) no service to \ncustomers is interrupted. To meet N-1 compliance, the dispatch of power flows on the transmission path between \nLeyte and the Cebu, Negros, and Panay subgrid would be limited to 220 MW, versus 360 MW under the current \napproach.  \n ", "Appendix 3     27 \n \nB.  Rationale for Fuel Type \n \n7.  Given the security constraints in the Cebu, Negros, and Panay grid, more expensive \ndiesel plants are currently being dispatched on a \"must run\" basis (or more similar to base-load \nplants), which is polluting, costly, and inefficient.4 Thus, the next capacity addition that makes \nmost sense for each island in the Cebu, Negros, and Panay grid is a new base-load plant. For \nNegros, base-load capacity could be supplied from geothermal sources. For Cebu and Panay \nhowever, the most sensible fuel supply for a base-load plant is coal. Table A3 illustrates a \ncomparative analysis of potential alternative fuel types. A coal-fired power plant in Cebu would \ntake  second  priority  in  dispatch  after  available  geothermal  capacity  via  interconnection, \ndisplacing existing diesel plants that will operate as peaking plants as designed.  \n \nTable A3: Comparative Analysis of Alternative Fuel Types for a Power Plant in Cebu \n \nBase  Capacity \u2265  Fuel Locally \nPlant  Remarks \nPlant  150 MW  Available \nNuclear  Yes  Yes  No  Not recommended due to public fear of \nnuclear accidents \nHydro  No  Yes  No  Not recommended due to lack of \nadequate water sources \nBiomass  No  No  Yes  Limited fuel supply \nGeothermala  Yes  Yes  No  No local geothermal fields in Cebu \nSolar or Wind  No  Yes  Yes  Limited solar and wind power resources \nand large area needed.

Relatively \nexpensive. \nNatural Gasb  Yes  Yes  No  Not recommended because fuel is not \navailable \nCoal  Yes  Yes  Yes  Fuel is available locally and imported. \nCleaner technology is available. \na Geothermal is not expected to be a large contributor to additional power supply in the near future because of the \nhigh risk, long lead times, and high capital costs related to exploration (finding steam and locating reliable wells). \nExisting geothermal projects on Leyte and Negros are not performing as expected. \nb The Malampaya gas field has sufficient capacity to support another 300\u2013500 MW power station. However, \ncombined-cycle gas turbine plants in the Visayas are unlikely to achieve a sufficient capacity factor to meet the \ntake-or-pay obligations required to justify a liquified natural gas terminal \nSource: Korea Electric Power Corporation and SPC Power Corporation. \n \n8.  The optimum capacity for a new plant was determined as part of the feasibility study in \nNovember 2004. The study concluded that 200 MW was the optimal base-load capacity due to \nthe size and projected demand of the Visayas grid. For a plant this size, the capacity factor \nwould be more than 75% from the first year of operation, and more than 80% from the next year \non. Capacity factors above 75% represent an efficient and cost-effective operation for a base-\nload plant. \n \n                                                 \n4  The short-run marginal cost in 2008 for a diesel plant is estimated to be P5,022\u2013P9,868 per megawatt-hour, \ncompared to P1,400 for CFB coal, P3,000 for pulverized coal, and P1,120 for geothermal.  \n ", "28     Appendix 3 \nC.  Rationale for CFB Technology \n \n9.  Of  the  35  plants  in  the  Visayas,  only  5  are  100  MW  or  more.  The  largest  single \ngenerating unit is 77.5 MW. In terms of unit size, the feasibility study recommends 100 MW after \ntaking  into  consideration  the  grid  operating  conditions,  projected  demand  increases,  and \neconomic considerations. The small size of the Visayas grid5 and the dependency of the \ntransmission  system  on  submarine  cables  with  limited  capacity  mean  that  the  ramp-up  or \noutage of units much larger than 100 MW could have a highly disruptive impact on the physical \npower system, as well as on the market for power.  \n \n10.  The  advantages  of  applying  supercritical  (or  once-through)  technology  to  coal-fired \npower plants include reduced fuel costs due to higher efficiencies6 and lower carbon emissions. \nHowever, supercritical technology is typically adopted only in large power plants where the unit \ncapacity is around 500 MW or higher.7 It is not cost-effective for small power plants to apply this \nkind of technology because it requires more capital to build boilers with the high-quality steel \nnecessary to withstand high temperatures. Furthermore, efficiencies gained from a small boiler \nusing supercritical technology is not significantly different from one using subcritical technology. \nFor these reasons, no boilers below 400\u2013500 MW using supercritical technology are available in \nthe market. The Project is therefore utilizing subcritical technology, with a combustion system \nthat involves CFB firing as opposed to pulverized coal firing. \n \n11.  CFB combustion technology enables the plant to use a wider variety of coal and reduce \nsulfur dioxide and nitrous oxides emissions. These are more observable pollutants that have \nmore of a direct health impact on neighboring communities. CFB evolved from efforts to find a \ncombustion process able to control pollutant emissions without external emission controls (such \nas  scrubbers).  Desulfurization  takes  place  within  the  process  itself  by  using  limestone  to \nprecipitate out sulfate during combustion. This reduces the amount of sulfur emitted in the form \nof sulfur dioxide emissions. Since the technology also allows coal plants to burn at cooler \ntemperatures, nitrous oxides emissions are reduced and no additional equipment or process is \nrequired to remove them \n.\n \n12.  Integrating the two concepts of supercritical and CFB has not been a high priority for \nmanufacturers because the added efficiency of once-through technology does not result in \nsignificant  fuel  savings  since  the  fuel  is  typically  low  in  cost  for  CFB  combustion  boilers. \nGlobally, no efforts are being made to adopt supercritical technology for CFB-type power plants \nwith 100 MW unit capacity. \n                                                 \n5  System peak for the region is about 1,200 MW and 600 MW for Cebu island.  \n6  Supercritical turbines envision running a boiler at extremely high temperatures and pressures with projected \nefficiencies as high as 46%. \n7  The cost per MW decreases with increased plant size. Recent plants built in Europe and Asia use supercritical \nboiler-turbine technology and the People\u2019s Republic of China has made this standard for all new plants 600 MW \nand larger. \n ", "     Appendix 4     29 \nENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS DUE DILIGENCE REPORT \n \nA.  Environmental Due Diligence \n \n1.  The Visayas Base-Load Power Project (the Project) is classified as category A following \nthe  Environment  Policy  (2002)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  environmental \nimpacts of the Project were assessed and the Government approved the environmental impact \nassessment  (EIA)  on  5  December  2005.  The  summary  environmental  impact  assessment \n(SEIA) was prepared and, in accordance with ADB's Public Communications Policy (2005), was \ndisclosed to the public through ADB website on 10 March 2009. This appendix updates some \naspects of the SEIA based on the ongoing development of the Project and improvements based \non measures to comply further with ADB safeguards policies. \n \n2.  A mission1 visited the project site to assess the environment and social activities, and to \naddress any remaining environmental issues anticipated during project operation. The mission \nmet with project management and staff who provided briefings and key project documents. The \nmission toured the project construction areas, proposed pier expansion, discharge canal and \nash  pond  disposal  sites,  and  the  existing  Naga  Power  Plant  Complex  of  SPC  Power \nCorporation (SPC). The mission also met with local residents to obtain their views and concerns \nabout the Project.  \n \n1.  Mission Findings and Observations  \n3.  Compliance with Philippine Environmental Regulations. The Project is subject to the \nGovernment\u2019s  Presidential  Decree  1586,  Establishing  the  Philippine  Environmental  Impact \nSystem  and  its  implementing  rules  and  regulations.  The  rules  and  regulations  identify  the \nprescribed  projects  and  approval  process  requiring  EIA.  Based  on  the  EIA  report  (2005) \nprepared by Test Consultants Inc., the Department of Environment Natural Resources (DENR) \ngranted  environmental  approval  for  the  Project  on  5  December  2005.  Based  on  the \nenvironmental assessment report for the 138-kilovolt double circuit on steel towers (kV DC/ST) \ntransmission line from KEPCO (Korea Electric Power Corporation) Power Plant New Naga \n(Cebu) SS prepared by the National Transmission Corporation, Environmental Management \nBureau Region 7, the Department of Environment Natural Resources granted environmental \napproval in 20 February 2009. Other environmental laws applicable to the Project include (i) \nRepublic Act 6969, Toxic Substances, Hazardous and Nuclear Wastes Control Act of 1990; \nRepublic Act 8749, The Clean Air Act; (iii) Republic Act 9275, The Clean Water Act; and (iv) \nPresidential Decree 984, The National Pollution Control Decree of 1976. \n \n4.  Plant Location and Ecologically Sensitive Areas. The Project is located 22 kilometers \n(km) south-southwest of Cebu City, the premier urban center in the province of Cebu. The \nproject area comprises mainly mountain ranges on the western side and Bohol Strait on the \neastern side. It is drained by two rivers: the Colon and Pandan. Colon River is smaller, with \nheadwaters west of the project site. It flows from northwest to southeast and exits to Bohol Strait \nabout 0.5 km from the project site. Further west and south is Pandan River, which flows from \nnorth to south and then west\u2013northwest to east\u2013southeast to Bohol Strait about 1.5 km south of \n                                                 \n1  An ADB mission visited the Visayas Base-Load Project site in March and April 2009. The mission in March 2009 \ncomprised Shih-liang Tu, senior environment specialist, and Arlene Porras, environmental and social safeguards \nconsultant. The follow-up mission in April comprised Marinela Cecilia T. Pascua, environment officer and Arlene \nPorras. \n  ", "30     Appendix 4 \nNaga. The project site is not located or adjacent to any area of cultural or ecological significance \nsuch as cultural heritage site, national park, protected area, wildlife sanctuary, or special area \nfor protecting biodiversity. \n \n5.  Airshed. The ambient air quality monitoring in Naga area from July 2007 to June 2008 \nindicates that total suspended particulate matter is within national standards. However, the \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines are exceeded significantly.2 Ambient air \nquality monitoring by the existing Naga Power Plant shows levels within national and WHO \nguidelines except for the second quarter when particulate matter was significantly beyond the \nlimits. However, the data from the Naga Power Plant area are unreliable as requirements, such \nas duration of sampling and frequency, are not adequately met during the monitoring to base a \nclassification.  The  decommissioning  of  the  existing  Naga  Power  Plant  is  not  imminent. \nTherefore, the Project will need to ensure that any increase in air pollution will be minimal and \nwill amount to a fraction of applicable national guidelines.  \n \n6.  Environment Management Plan. The environment management plan (EMP) for the \nProject was formulated as part of the project EIA and comprises a set of measures to mitigate \npotential impacts that may occur during all phases of project implementation. Its main objective \nis to minimize the direct and indirect negative environmental impacts of the Project through \nsound  planning  and  introduction  of  proper  construction  and  monitoring  techniques  during \nconstruction and operation.  \n \n2.  During Construction \n7.  Air Quality and Noise. The mission found that based on the Project's EMP during \nconstruction,  ambient  and  source-specific  air  quality  monitoring  is  conducted  for  total \nsuspended  particulate,  sulfur  dioxide,  nitrogen  dioxide,  carbon  monoxide,  and  noise  using \nmethods of sampling and analyses based on United States Environment Protection Agency \nMethods and Philippine standards for Air and Water. Recent construction monitoring data show \nthe levels are within the maximum national and World Bank environmental, health, and safety \n(EHS) guidelines (Table A4.1). \n \n8.  Water Quality. The Project is following the mitigation measures to reduce the impact of \nconstruction  on  water  quality,  as  outlined  in  the  SEIA,  including  (i)  proper  management, \nhandling, and disposal of spoils and unsuitable materials to prevent siltation and sedimentation \nof nearby water bodies; (ii) construction of bund walls of adequate capacity around fuel, oil, and \nsolvent storage tanks to minimize the risk of contamination of nearby receiving bodies of water; \nand (iii) establishment of oil and grease traps in drainage systems (from workshops, vehicle and \nplant washing facilities, and service and fuelling areas). Based on the EMP during construction, \nsurface water quality monitoring is in place with parameters measured using standard methods \nfor examination of water and wastewater. Recent construction monitoring data of the marine \nwaters  off  Bohol  Strait  indicate  levels  generally  below  national  limits  except  for  dissolved \noxygen, which is above limits (Table A4.2). \n \n9.  Coastal  Erosion  and  Sedimentation.  Coastal  sedimentation  may  bury  the  natural \ncoastline and affect marine biota. Runoff velocities will be kept low through the development of \nmilder  slopes  or  breaking  the  slope,  to  decrease  the  erosive  force  of  water.

The program's EHS policies \ninclude (i) promoting control of the residual impact of atmospheric emissions, ground or sea \nwater,  and  wastes  in  all  construction  activities  to  preserve  the  natural  environment;  \n(ii) promoting health and protection of human beings by identifying, controlling, and monitoring \nrisk; adapting safety processes; and being prepared for emergencies; and (iii) promoting the \napplication of the rules of safety and protection of workers and equipment, and considering \nthese rules to be applied to suppliers and subcontractors. EHS team responsibilities include  \n(i) issue and promote the EHS active program, (ii) manage the EHS index, (iii) provide risk \ncontrol  management,  (iv)  inspect  workers  and  equipment,  (v)  provide  EHS  education  and \ninduction, (v) issue EHS contracts, (vi) manage site security, (vii) monitor physical examination \nresults, (viii) manage first aid and site emergency control, (ix) manage environmental monitoring \nand control, and (x) liaise with local government regarding EHS concerns. No accidents have \nbeen recorded.  \n \n16.  KSPC  will  establish  an  environmental  management  system  (EMS),  to  be  led  and \nmonitored by its environmental department, with three staff and one manager during project \noperation.  The  Project  will  comply  with  all  relevant  local  laws  and  regulations  regarding \nenvironmental protection.  \n \nB.  Social Safeguard Due Diligence \n1.  Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement \na.  KEPCO Power Plant \n \n17.  KSPC acquired the land for the coal-fired power plant (visited by the mission) through \nopen and competitive bidding conducted by NPC and PSALM on 14 November 2005. KSPC will \nlease the land for 25 years; its only use will be for the new power plant. The Naga land has an \napproximate area of 119,406 square meters (m2). Of this only 84,359 m2 will be occupied by the \nproposed power plant project. This parcel of land is registered in the name of NPC under \nOriginal Certificate of Title No. OP-58961. \n \n18.  The land used to be occupied by 22 nontitled and/or informal settler families. KSPC, \nNPC, and Naga City, Cebu, signed a memorandum of agreement for the necessary negotiations \n ", "34     Appendix 4 \nwith the affected nontitled and/or informal settler families and secured the relocation site just \noutside  the  leased  land.  Of  the  22  affected  families,  17  have  voluntarily  evacuated  and \nrelocated. The local government unit (LGU) provided the affected families with a plot of land in \nthe  relocation  site.  KSPC  provided  financial  assistance  and  the  required  labor  force  for \nconstruction of their new houses. KSPC assisted with demolition of the existing structures \nthrough its contractor, and owners were allowed to keep salvageable materials for use to \nreconstruct their new houses. Each family was provided with a lot of 30 m2 for the dwelling \nstructure.  The  relocation  activities  started  on  15  October  2008  and  were  completed  after  \n1  month.  The  remaining  five  families,  who  claimed  to  have  legal  titles  and  have  partially \nencroached on the leased land, have filed a case in court. While awaiting the court resolution, \nthe encroached areas have been fenced off and the families remain unaffected. \n \n19.  The relocation site is publicly owned land. At the time of the mission, no certificates of \naward had been granted to the relocated families. The barangay officials in close coordination \nwith the Office of the Mayor had initiated the process of preparing the necessary certificates of \naward, which have legal standing and represent protection for relocated families against eviction \nor repossession of home lots. KSPC will assist the municipality in accessing funds provided by \nSection 289 of the Local Government Code and Energy Regulations No. 1-94 of Department of \nEnergy. \n \n20.  The  mission  visited  the  resettlement  site  to  assess  the  condition  of  housing  and \ninfrastructure, and community living standards. The mission found that the new houses are well \nconstructed and located in an elevated area with access to fresh sea breeze and away from the \nash pond of the old plant, where they used to experience a bad dust smell. The mission held \ndiscussions with the barangay officials and local residents. The mission also inspected the new \naccess road going to the resettlement site and the water supply system for the relocated \nfamilies. It was noted that KSPC had played a significant role not only in financing physical \nimprovements to the area, but also supporting community programs and emergency assistance. \nAside from physical improvements and moving allowance, a new access road (gravel type only), \npower, and water supply (i.e., shallow wells) have been provided to the relocated people. More \ninformation  is  available  from  KSPC's  Social  Development  Plan  and  Corporate  Social \nResponsibility Program. \n \n21.  No outstanding grievances are related to compensation for structures owned by informal \nsettlers. Relocated families said in interviews that they are satisfied with their present situation \nbecause the relocation site is very accessible to their work place, and basic utilities (power and \nwater) are provided. A respondent said that the financial package of P15,000 per family is not \nenough to rebuild their house and the allocated lot of 30 m2 is too small, as their previous lot \nwas at least 50 m2. An LGU official mentioned that subdivision of the available resettlement area \nwas  calculated  at  30  m2  per  relocate  to  accommodate  all  17  families.  The  Office  of  the \nBarangay Captain serves as the channel to accept and address complaints, requests, and \ngrievances from local residents. The Social Development Plan also applies to relocated families. \n \nb.  138 KV DC-ST Transmission Line from KEPCO Power Plant to New \nNaga (Cebu) Substation \n \n22.  The National Grid Corporation of the Philippines3 project related to the KSPC plant \nincludes the following components: (i) substation area; (ii) access road; and (iii) right-of-way \n                                                 \n3  The National Grid Corporation of the Philippines has been awarded the 25-year concession contract to manage the \ncountry's power grid and in January 2009 took over these operations from National Transmission Corporation. \n ", "Appendix 4     35 \n(ROW) corridors of the transmission line components, including the KSPC project transmission \nline.

Use of the ROW easement of the transmission lines, including the land required for steel \ntowers to be erected inside the Salcon Power Plant Complex, is covered by the Naga co-use \nagreement executed by NPC, PSALM, and KSPC on 25 June 2008. For ROW passing through \nprivate lands, landowners will be paid at current fair market value. The initial standard rate used \nto calculate compensation was P389.00 per m2. After negotiations with affected people and to \nreflect the latest Schedule of Unit Base Market Value for Residential, Commercial and Industrial \nLands for the Municipality of Naga in Cebu, the rate was increased to P813 per m2. While the \nland use is residential, TransCo adopted the valuation for industrial lands. \n \n24.  A short resettlement plan for the project transmission line was extracted from the main \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan.  Affected  households  will  be  granted  disturbance \ncompensation and the option to self-relocate to their chosen or preferred place of residence. \nThey can opt to transfer in the same vicinity as long as they move their structure 30 meters \naway from the right-of-way limit, i.e., 15 m from the left and 15 m from the right. Together with \nthe tenants, landowners will be compensated for affected crops, plants, and trees. The land \nacquisition and resettlement cost for the KEPCO line is estimated at P7 million.  \n \n25.  Prior to actual implementation of the Project, National Grid Corporation of the Philippines \n(NGCP)  undertook  consultation,  dialogue,  and  information  campaigns  with  project-affected \npeople, LGUs, and other stakeholders to keep them fully informed about the important aspects \nof the Project. After all consultations and dialogue, an official endorsement from the affected \nLGUs (Colon barangay and Naga City), and development councils was secured as proof of \nsocial acceptance of the Project. \n \n ", "36     Appendix 4 \n2.  Indigenous Peoples \n26.  No indigenous people live in Naga City. The majority of household populations classify \nthemselves as Cebuano. No indigenous people will be affected by the Project. Therefore no \nissues are resulting from the requirements of ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \n  3.  Community Engagement \n \n27.  As  part  of its  commitment  to  meet  the  conditions  of  the  environmental  compliance \ncertificate, KSPC will implement and undertake a social development plan (SDP) and various \ncorporate social responsibility (CSR)4 projects and activities. The SPD and CSR activities \nbegan upon commencement of construction activities and will continue throughout commercial \nproduction of the KSPC power plant. \n \n28.  The SDP will include activities and programs to benefit not only the barangay directly \naffected by the Project but the entire host community. The SDP incorporated with the CSR will \nhave  an  annual  budget  of  P240,000.00  with  projects  and  activities  that  involve  health, \nsanitation,  nutrition,  and  education.  No  specific  budget  per  year  is  allocated  for  relocated \nfamilies but the SDP is applicable for all local residents in Colon barangay. \n \nC.   Conclusions and Recommendations \n \n29.  Environment.  The  mission  confirms  that  ADB's  environmental  assessment \nrequirements as well as national and local requirements related to environmental impacts of the \nProject have been adequately met. Environment, health, and safety management and plans are \nin  place  with  responsibilities  of  addressing  environmental  impacts  and  implementation  of \nmitigating  measures  during  construction  by  Doosan.  Site  visit  and  construction  monitoring \nresults indicate that the ongoing construction of the Project has no significant adverse impact on \nthe  environment.  Follow-up  environmental  management  studies  and  plans  are  now  being \nundertaken to provide for more detailed planning. Implementation of the Project's EMP during \noperation will ensure that any adverse or significant impacts will be adequately addressed. \nApplicable national and World Bank environmental standards are and will be strictly monitored \nand adhered to. \n \n30.  Involuntary Resettlement. For land acquisition and resettlement issues, the Mission did \nnot find any outstanding issues with the compensation and assistance provided to nontitled \nfamilies relocated from the Project site. For the project transmission line, a short resettlement \nplan was prepared, which the mission found satisfactory. Moreover, KSPC will continue to assist \naffected families and contribute to the local community through its SDP and the CSR program.  \n \n31.  Indigenous Peoples. With respect to the requirements of ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples, the mission found that the Project will not affect any indigenous peoples. Hence, the \nProject is categorized as C. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  In compliance with condition 6 provided upon the issuance of Board of Investment certificate of registration, which \nstates that the company will undertake various CSR projects and activities. \n ", "        Appendix 5     37 \nSHORT RESETTLEMENT PLAN FOR THE PROJECT TRANSMISSION LINE \n \nA.  Description of the Project \n1.  The proposed 138 kV DC-ST transmission line from the KEPCO SPC Power Corporation \n(KSPC) Power Plant to the New Naga (Cebu) Substation (the project transmission line) aims to \nprovide a new termination point that can accommodate future load growth and maintain an \nelectricity highway characterized as a reliable, secure, stable, and resilient power system. It will \nestablish the asset boundary between the National Transmission Company (TransCo) asset \nboundary  and  power  plant  by  separating  control  of  Salcon  Power  Plant  Complex  from \nTransCo\u2019s  substation.  The  proposed  substation  will  serve  as  the  receiving  station  of  the \nproposed  KSPC  200  megawatt  (MW)  Coal-Fired  Power  Plant.  The  old  Naga  (Salcon) \nswitchyard is already congested, and all the installed protection equipment and materials are \nunderrated and operating beyond their economic life. \n \nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement  \n \n2.  A social analysis carried out in the project area concludes that the Project would require \nland acquisition and resettlement. The project transmission line will cover the installation of a \n0.70 kilometer (km) long transmission line (138 kV DC/ST) from the KSPC power plant to the \nNew Naga Substation. For expediency, the land acquisition and resettlement program for the \nproject transmission line will be incorporated into the overall land acquisition and resettlement \nplan (September 2008) prepared by TransCo, which will be implemented by National Grid \nCorporation of the Philippines (NGCP)36 as part of the New Naga Substation Project. In addition \nto the project transmission line, the NGCP New Naga Substation Project land acquisition and \nresettlement plan (LARP) also covers the following components, which are not being proposed \nfor  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  financing:  (i)  expansion  of  the  existing  New  Naga \nSubstation, (ii) construction of the Banilad\u2013Quiot\u2013New Naga 138 kV cut-in-line, (iii) Suba L1 and \nL2 138 kV line extension, (iv) Sigpit and Suba L3 138 kV line extension, and (v) New Naga 69 \nkV line extension.  \n \n3.  Approximately half of the length of the project transmission line will pass inside the \nSalcon Power Complex (i.e., existing Naga Power Plant). A 30-meter wide right-of-way (ROW) \ncorridor will pass through flat to rolling lands, and affect about 10 houses and 9 secondary \nstructures, most of which are located beside a barangay road that the line will traverse. Table \nA5.1 summarizes the Project\u2019s impact on people, structures, and properties. \n \n4.  Use of the ROW easement for the transmission lines, including the land required for \nsteel towers to be erected inside the Salcon Power Plant Complex, is covered by an agreement \nto be finalized between KSPC, PSALM and SPC. For ROW passing through private lands, \nlandowners will be paid at current fair market value. The initial standard rate used to calculate \ncompensation was P389.00 per square meter (m2). After negotiations with affected people and \nto  reflect  the  latest  Schedule  of Unit  Base Market  Value  for  Residential,  Commercial  and \nIndustrial Lands for the Municipality of Naga in Cebu, the rate was increased to P813 per m2. \nWhile the land use is residential, NGCP adopted the valuation for industrial lands. \n \n                                                 \n36  The National Grid Corporation of the Philippines was awarded the 25-year concession contract to manage the \ncountry's power grid and in January 2009 took over these operations from TransCo.

House and structure owners will be paid the replacement cost of their houses and \nstructures. Relocated households will be granted disturbance compensation. Together with the \ntenants,  landowners  will  be  compensated  for  affected  crops,  plants,  and  trees.  The  land \nacquisition and resettlement cost for the project transmission line is estimated at P7 million.  \n \nC.  Resettlement Principles and Policy Framework \n \n6.  The  resettlement  principles  adopted  for  the  project  transmission  line  recognize  the \nnational and local laws such as the Republic Act 8974,37 RA 7279, Article VII, Urban Renewal \nand Resettlement (Sections 26 and 28), and relevant ADB policies and operations manuals, in \nparticular ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and Operations Manual (OM) F2 on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  (2006). 38 The  resettlement  principles  adopted  for  the  project \ntransmission line will comply with ADB social safeguard requirements.  \n \n7.  The primary objective of this short resettlement plan is to identify impacts and plan \nmeasures to mitigate various losses due to implementation of the project transmission line. The \nresettlement  plan  is  based  on  the  general  findings  of  the  census  survey,  field  visits,  and \nmeetings with various project-affected people in the affected area. Taking into account the \nvarious losses, the entitlement matrix provides for compensation and resettlement assistance to \nall those affected including nontitleholders. In general terms, the people affected by the project \ntransmission line will be entitled to the following: (i) payment for nonagricultural lands (i.e., \nresidential, industrial, commercial land); (ii) payment for crops, plants, and trees; (iii) payment \nfor  houses  and  other  structures;  and  (iv)  grant  for  disturbance  compensation  to  relocated \nhouseholds. \n \n8.  The  policy  also  provides  integrated  income  restoration  measures  for  affected \nhouseholds losing their source of income and income opportunity. The census survey identifies \n10 households living along the route of the project transmission line that currently derive their \nlivelihood from working as laborers and construction workers, operating a small convenience \nstore, raising livestock, among others. The construction of the project transmission line will \nrequire relocation of 10 households. The affected households will self relocate to locations of \ntheir choice. They are likely to resettle within the same vicinity but outside the 30-meter ROW \n                                                 \n37  Republic Act No. 8974.

Most of the people affected rely on wages for their livelihood hence their income will be \ntemporarily affected during reconstruction of their dwelling units. In addition to compensation for \nstructures at replacement cost, they will be provided disturbance compensation sufficient to \ncover their expenses while reconstructing their houses and/or structures. Skilled workers and \nlaborers from among the affected households will be prioritized for project-related employment. \nThis requirement is clearly specified in the terms of reference for contractors. The literacy and \nskills training program of the Social Development Plan will give priority to affected people who \nlack skills and other directly affected people who wish to learn new livelihood skills. \n \n9.  A detailed entitlement matrix lists various types of subproject losses, identification and/or \neligibility, and entitlements; and provides basic parameters for preparation of compensation and \nresettlement benefits (Table A5.2). The end of the validation period for affected people based \non  the  parcellary  and  house-to-house  surveys  will  serve  as  the  cut-off  date  in  identifying \naffected people who are entitled to compensation and benefits. A written notice about the NGCP \nProject,  including  the  project  transmission  line,  and  the  cut-off  date  will  be  given  to  the \nrespective barangay officials. People moving into the subproject area after this date will not be \nentitled for compensation and assistance. \n \nTable A5.2: Entitlement Matrix  \n \nCompensation/Mitigating  Entitled  No. of \nType of Loss/Impact  Application \nMeasures  Person  Households \nLoss of  Nonagricultural lands  Payment of land based on  Landowner  5 \nnonagricultural lands  located within the  current fair market value \n(i.e., residential,  proposed transmission line \nindustrial, commercial  ROW corridors, substation \nland)  area, and access road \nLoss of standing  Crops, plants, and trees  Cash compensation based on  Owners of  5 \ncrops, plants, and  located within the  fair market value  affected \ntrees  proposed transmission line  crops, \nROW corridors, substation  plants, and \narea, and access road  trees \nLoss of structure  Houses and structures  Cash compensation based on  House  13 \nand/or house  located within the  replacement cost (no  and/or \nproposed transmission line  depreciation)  structure \nROW corridors, substation  Owners may retain salvageable  owner \narea, and access road  materials if they completely \ndismantle their affected houses \nor structures \nLoss of income and/or  Households that have to  Disturbance compensation  Relocated  10 \ndisturbance of  transfer residence due to  equivalent to the daily minimum  households  \nrelocated people  the Project  wage in the project-affected \nduring transfer of  area multiplied by 60 days  \nresidence   \nIf qualified, will be prioritized for \nproject-related employment \n \nSkills training \n  Note: This entitlement matrix applies to the overall NGCP Project including the Korea Electric Power Corporation   \n            transmission line. \nSource: NGCP (formerly TransCo) Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan New Naga Substation Project, September   \n2008. \n \n \n \n \n ", "40     Appendix 5 \nD.

Budget and Implementation Schedule \n \n19.  The total estimated cost for resettlement, operation, and management for the project \ntransmission line is P7 million. The estimate includes all costs related to compensation for land, \nresettlement cost, and other benefits as per the entitlement benefits, plus the nongovernment \norganization cost. The costs of the private land and trees were derived in close coordination \nwith the city assessor's office, local residents, and affected people based on the prevalent \nmarket value of land in the area. \n \n20.  In addition to the resettlement budget, KSPC has allocated P20,000 annually for literacy \nand skills training for directly affected people as well as residents of Colon barangay.  \n \n21.  Activities for public acceptance, from identification of affected LGUs up to the securing of \nproject endorsements, are complete. All the affected LGUs and development councils endorsed \nthe Project by 31 March 2008. Land acquisition and resettlement activities, such as identification \nand  socioeconomic  survey  of  affected  people,  secondary  data  gathering,  preliminary  cost \nestimation of affected properties, and actual preparation and securing approval were conducted \nfrom January to September 2008. The measurement and detailed cost estimation of houses and \nstructures; counting of crops, plants, and trees; and inventory of other affected properties were \nstarted earlier even prior to NGCP approval of the LARP.

Monitoring Arrangements \n \n22.   NGCP will have overall responsibility to supervise and monitor implementation of the \nshort  resettlement  plan  through  its  Social  Engineering  and  Right-of-Way  Management \nDepartment in coordination with KSPC representatives. KSPC will report to ADB on a quarterly \nbasis during implementation of the resettlement plan. The monitoring report will address all \naspects  of  relocation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  of  households.  The  nongovernment \norganization  implementing  the  resettlement  plan  will  conduct  field  monitoring  and  monthly \nassessments of progress in the field, and prepare the monthly report for NGCP and KSPC. \nKSPC will prepare a complete status report on resettlement plan implementation and submit it \nto  ADB  when  the  resettlement  plan  has  been  implemented.  The  report  will  reflect  the \nresettlement experience and identify lessons to improve management of resettlement for future \nprojects. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "44  Appendix 6      \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title: Philippines/Visayas Base-Load Power Development Project \n \nLending/Financing  Department/  Private Sector Operations Department/ \nDirect Loan \nModality:  Division:  Infrastructure Finance Division 2 \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe \nhow the project would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty \nreduction strategy of the partner country. \n \nPower generated by the Project will be connected to the local grid, which will contribute to the Government\u2019s goal of \nproviding affordable, universal electric service by 2011. Increasing power supplies to local grids will bring the benefits of \nelectricity  to  remote  communities,  including  better  health  care,  sanitation,  and  education;  greater  income-earning \nopportunities; and higher living standards.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                 Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.   Key Issues  \nThe Project will contribute to poverty reduction by supporting economic development of the Visayas region by providing \nneeded power to support economic activities. The Project will generate employment and the barangays (districts), \nmunicipality, province, and region will benefit directly from the Project through additional financial resources provided by \nSection 289 of the Local Government Code (LGC)a and Energy Regulation (ER) 1-94 from the Department of Energy.b \nThe project developer will assist the municipality in tapping the funds provided by Section 289 of the LGC and ER 1-94. \nIncreased economical and efficient base-load generation capacity in the region will enable the Government to meet \ndemand for electricity in 2011. A positive, direct impact on local labor is expected during implementation and an indirect \nimpact will be due to the increased income-earning opportunities generated by increased access to electricity. \n \n2.  Design Features.  \n \nThe Project is establishing a 200 megawatt (MW) thermal power project using circulating fluidized bed combustion boiler \ntechnology in Colon barangay of Naga City, in the province of Cebu. The Project includes the design and construction of \nan associated line to connect the plant to the New Naga Substation. The project developer will implement livelihood and \ncommunity development programs as part of the Social Development Plan (SCP) and Corporate Social Responsibility \ninitiative. \n \nC.   Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nNot applicable. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe Project requires minimal land acquisition and resettlement. \n \nKSPC will provide employment opportunities for qualified locals, and will contribute directly and indirectly to business \nopportunities in the area. Priority will be given to qualified residents of Naga for employment in plant operation to \nminimize the influx of migrants, who would exert tremendous financial pressures on the delivery of basic services by the \nhost municipality. Antipollution technology and devices will be installed to eradicate air pollutants and ensure they do not \ninfiltrate nearby communities. KSPC will continue monitoring the health of local communities, and contribute to the \nimprovement of health services and facilities. KSPC will continue to provide periodic medical missions with free \nmedicines. \n \nKSPC acquired land for the coal-fired power plant through open and competitive bidding held in November 2005 by NPC \nand PSALM. The land, also called Naga land, was leased to KSPC for 25 years and will be solely used for the \nconstruction, testing, operation, management, and maintenance of the new power plant. KSPC has provided financial \nassistance  and  the  needed  labor  force  to  construct  dwelling  units  for  relocated  families.  KSPC  provided  basic ", "Appendix 6     45 \ninfrastructure and utilities, such as a new access road, power, and water supply in the relocation site. Due diligence \nconfirms that no outstanding issues relate to those affected by the construction of the power plant (Supplementary \nAppendix 4 on environment and social due diligence report).  \n \nFor the proposed KSPC transmission line, acquisition of public and private land will affect livelihood patterns of people \nliving in villages close to the project site. In addition to permanent private land losses, standing crops, plants, and trees \nlocated within the transmission line right-of-way corridors will also be affected. During construction, activities over \n4\u20135 years would result in movement of construction materials, equipment, and temporary in-migration of labor force dust, \nand noise pollution and may contribute to pressure on water resources, sanitation, and solid waste management \nsystems. The Project is expected to generate livelihood and employment opportunities during plant construction and \noperation. KSPC has adopted measures to address community concerns about compensation packages for land \nacquisition, replacement of agricultural land, and apprehension of environmental pollution due to the Project, including \nredress of grievances. \n \nNo indigenous peoples reside in Naga City. Most of the household population classify themselves as Cebuano. Since no \nindigenous peoples will be affected by the Project, it is categorized as C with respect to ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples (1998). \n \nAs  part  of  its  corporate  social  responsibility,  the  project  company  developed  an  SDP,  which  covers  proposed \ninterventions of KSPC such as health, sanitation, and nutrition; education; and donations to support local government unit \ncommunity  programs  for  the  various  project  stakeholders.  An  annual  budget  of  P240,000  is  allocated  for  SDP \nimplementation. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe Government initiated discussions with the local community in October 2004 during the formal scoping meeting; a \nsecond meeting was conducted on 6 August 2005 as a public hearing on the findings of the environmental impact \nassessment for the Project. During the meeting, the Project's potential environmental and social impacts, land acquisition, \nrelocations, mitigation measures, and monitoring programs were discussed. Concerns raised were clarified and recorded, \nand mitigating measures incorporated in the reports. During project implementation, a multipartite monitoring team will be \nestablished, comprising officials of relevant government agencies, contractor, consultants, and local government units. \nThe team will be responsible for overseeing implementation of the monitoring program to ensure that public resistance to \ndevelopment is controlled through conduct of IEC and continuous implementation of the SDP.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n Information sharing           Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \n  \nThe community and various stakeholders were consulted in different venues for participation in the study. These \nconsultations include informal interviews, a formal scoping meeting, and public hearing. Residents and other project \nstakeholders were given the opportunity to discuss the possible environmental and social impacts of the Project. Local \ngovernment officials from cities and barangays have shown their support for the Project through issuance of official \nendorsement.  \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues. Women are normally responsible for caring for the family especially attending to basic health needs of \nchildren. If the relocated untitled families continue to live at the site close to the power plant, incidence of illness may \nincrease and the women will have to carry the burden of caring for sick children.  \n \n2.  Key Actions.
