INTRODUCTION\n1. The Operations Evaluation Department (OED) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\nprovides independent evaluation of ADB\u2019s operations. This includes evaluating the performance\nof completed projects, programs, and technical assistance (TA). It also includes (i) reviewing\nand selectively validating completion reports and other self-evaluation activities of operational\ndepartments; (ii) providing real-time feedback on ongoing operations, including the design of\nnew operations; (iii) evaluating the effectiveness of ADB\u2019s policies, practices, and procedures;\n(iv) monitoring and reporting on actions taken by ADB and its executing agencies in response to\nOED recommendations in evaluation reports; (v) building evaluation capacity within developing\nmember countries (DMCs) to enhance their evaluation systems; (vi) coordinating evaluation\npractices  and  activities  with  other  multilateral  development  banks  through  the  Evaluation\nCooperation Group; and (vii) coordinating with multilateral and bilateral assistance agencies on\nevaluation  through  the  Working  Party  on  Aid  Evaluation  of  the  Development  Assistance\nCommittee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. To enhance its\ncontribution to ADB\u2019s development effectiveness, OED also carries out a series of thematic\nstudies in the form of impact, special, and country assistance program evaluations (CAPEs).\n2. The primary aims of all ADB\u2019s evaluation activities are to provide lessons learned for\nfuture  operations,  accountability  for  use  of  resources,  and  follow-up  recommendations  for\nsustaining the benefits of activities supported by ADB. Completed projects, programs, and TA\nactivities are selected independently by OED for the purpose of performance audits, which allow\nan assessment of how well resources have been used. Lessons learned from performance\naudits and other activities are also disseminated for incorporation in new operations. Thematic\nevaluation studies provide a broader assessment of development effectiveness. They include\nimpact evaluations, which assess the impact of similar projects in different DMCs or at the\nsector level within a DMC; special evaluations on policies and processes, which are also\nmulticountry; and CAPEs, which evaluate the overall range of activities supported by ADB in a\ngiven DMC and are therefore multisector and multiactivity. The topics for thematic evaluation\nstudies are selected in coordination with operational departments.\n3. A draft 2002 work program for OED was reviewed by the Development Effectiveness\nCommittee of the Board of Directors. The work program, summarized in Appendix 1, includes\n21 project and 5 program performance audits, and 5 TA performance audits covering over\n20 TAs. It includes several other outputs of a recurring nature such as a review of OED\u2019s\nevaluation activities in 2001, evaluation of ADB\u2019s portfolio performance in 2001, and revision\nand updating of evaluation guidelines. It also includes eight thematic evaluation studies. While\nstaff consultants financed from ADB\u2019s administrative budget are used to assist OED staff in\nperformance audits, consulting and other services and materials necessary for carrying out the\nbroader thematic evaluation studies are resourced through TA funding. This arrangement, which\nhas been followed since 1998, is consistent with ADB\u2019s TA policy that allows TA resources to be\nused for sector-, policy-, and issues-oriented studies benefiting DMCs. A TA framework relating\nto the eight thematic evaluation studies is in Appendix 2.1\n                  \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in December 2001.", "2\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n4. Impact evaluation studies are multiactivity or multicountry. They seek to assess the\nresults of a group of activities in a particular sector, or to compare the results of similar activities\nin different DMCs. The emphasis is not simply on reviewing the outputs produced, or the\nobjectives achieved. Rather the emphasis is on the broader institutional or development impacts\nof ADB-assisted activities. The emphasis on impact provides a clearer picture of how projects\nand programs have contributed to the broad development goals of ADB and governments, at\nthe time of approval and post-completion. Recent impact evaluation studies have included the\nimpact of technical and vocational education projects in four DMCs (Malaysia, Pakistan, Papua\nNew Guinea, and Sri Lanka), and of ADB assistance to the road sector in Nepal. They also\ninclude an ongoing study of the impact of rural roads on poverty reduction. Three impact\nevaluation studies are included in the 2002 OED work program.\n5. Special  evaluation  studies  are  undertaken  in  relation  to  a  wide  range  of  topics.\nFrequently they relate to the policies or strategic concerns of ADB. Recent special evaluation\nstudies have included a study of the impact of the involuntary resettlement policy; a study on\ngender and development; a study of the quality, impacts, and usefulness of economic and\nsector work; and an evaluation of program lending. Ongoing special evaluations relate to the\neffectiveness of targeted and nontargeted approaches to poverty reduction, and of projects\napproved  under  Asian  Development  Fund  financing.2  Three  special  evaluation  studies  are\nincluded in the 2002 OED work program.\n6. CAPEs assess the range of ADB activities within a particular DMC over a substantial\nperiod of a decade or more. They seek to address issues, and make recommendations, relating\nto the focus of ADB activities, including the sector mix and use of assistance modalities. They\ncan therefore contribute to assessing current, and formulating new, country strategies. The\nbenefits of changes at a strategic level in the focus of ADB assistance programs can be\nsignificant. Given the greater country focus of future ADB operations, country level evaluations\nwill play a larger role in evaluation activities.3 Four such evaluations have been included in\nOED\u2019s work program in the last four years. Two CAPEs are included in the 2002 OED work\nprogram.\n7. Thematic  evaluation  studies,  because  of  their  multiactivity  and  multicountry  nature,\ngenerally  require  a  longer  time  and  a  larger  budget  than  performance  audit  reports.  It  is\nexpected that three or four of these thematic evaluation studies will be completed in 2003 rather\nthan  2002.  In  terms  of  OED  staff  time,  thematic  evaluation  studies  account  for  around\n30 percent  of  the  total.  From  operational  departments,  and  from  other  departments  and\nsometimes  the  Board  of  Directors,  there  is  a  demand  for  these  broader  studies  of  the\ndevelopment effectiveness of ADB operations. They will continue to play a prominent role in\nOED\u2019s work program in 2002 and beyond.\n                  \n2 The special evaluation of projects financed through the Asian Development Fund (ADF) is being undertaken in two\nphases, relating to the earlier interventions under ADF I-V, and the ongoing interventions under ADF VI-VII.\n3 Starting only in 1997, the World Bank has now completed around 50 country assistance evaluations and has an\nongoing program of such evaluations. Country level evaluations are also being implemented by other multilateral\ndevelopment banks. An approach and method for data collection and analysis for carrying out such evaluations is\nemerging through ongoing contacts among the evaluation departments of these organizations.", "3\nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n8. The objective of this TA is to finance the consulting and other requirements of eight\nthematic  evaluation  studies  designed  to  (i)  assess  the  relevance,  efficacy,  sustainability,\nimpacts,  and,  where  appropriate,  the  efficiency  of  various  ADB  operational  activities;  and\n(ii) provide timely feedback on operational issues to the DMCs and ADB. The primary outputs\nwill be eight separate thematic evaluation studies as described in the next section.\nB.  Scope\n9. Impact  Evaluation  Study  of  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Projects  in  Selected\nDeveloping Member Countries.  The water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector has accounted\nfor 4 percent of ADB\u2019s cumulative project lending. Urban and rural WSS projects contribute\ndirectly,  through  provision  of  safe  water,  and  indirectly,  through  improved  health  and\nenvironment, to poverty reduction. Recent performance audit reports have identified several key\nissues affecting the sector: (i) increasing demand for house connections, (ii) high percentage of\nnonrevenue water, (iii) poor financial performance of local and provincial public water supply\ncompanies, (iv) lack of policy on the rational allocation of water sources among various uses,\nand (v) pollution of surface and shallow groundwater sources.  It is necessary to gain a better\nunderstanding of the impact of WSS projects in order to engage in productive policy dialogue\nand formulate sector investments.\n10. The proposed study will (i) assess the impact of water supply and sanitation projects on\nthe availability of water to the beneficiaries, particularly women and poor people; (ii) assess the\npolicies  in  the  WSS  sector  relating  to  tariff  structure  and  levels,  supply  alternatives,  and\ninstitutional arrangements, including the participation of beneficiaries and the private sector; and\n(iii)  formulate  an  integrated  framework  for  future  WSS  projects,  including  private  sector\nparticipation in the construction and operation and maintenance of such projects. Financial\nbenefits and costs, as well as socioeconomic benefits and health effects, will be important\nindicators of impact on users. The study will carry out impact evaluations for up to ten WSS\nprojects in both urban and rural areas from among selected DMCs such as India, Kazakhstan,\nNepal, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam.\n11. Impact Evaluation Study of Government and Nongovernment Provision of Primary\nEducation. There is a trend in the Asian region toward decentralization of primary education\n(PE)  from  central  government-sponsored  to  community-organized  and  private-financed\nprovision. This trend has emerged in response to changes in both supply- and demand-side\nfactors. On the supply side, central governments have limited resources for providing schooling\nfor growing populations. On the demand side, improvements in the quality of PE are needed\nboth from the point of view of parents and their children and from the viewpoint of DMCs as a\nwhole. Private for-profit and community schools are increasing, particularly in urban areas, while\npublic school enrolments decline and drop-out levels remain high. The study will evaluate the\nconsequences for the cost and quality of PE, and the impact on access for different groups,\nparticularly the poor.\n12. The proposed study will (i) assess the experience of decentralization of educational\nprovision, including the impact of nongovernment provision of PE; (ii) compare different models", "4\nof PE provision in relation to costs and internal efficiencies; and (iii) facilitate the design of PE\nsystems that encourage enhanced quality at limited cost. The study will use secondary and\nprimary data sources on PE provision within a selection of countries such as Bangladesh,\nIndonesia, Pakistan, and Philippines.\n13. Impact Evaluation Study of Capacity Building for Managing Water Supply and\nSanitation and Housing Services in Pacific Developing Member Countries. Urban centers\nin  the  Pacific  developing  member  countries  (PDMCs)  are  small  in  absolute  terms,  and  in\ncomparison with cities elsewhere in the Asian region. However, the rate of population growth is\nhigher in the capital towns and other urban centers than in rural areas. Urbanization issues\ntherefore  are  increasingly  requiring  the  attention  of  governments  and  external  assistance\nagencies. Problems common to nearly all PDMC urban centers include deficiencies in provision\nof physical infrastructure for housing, water supply, sanitation and waste water treatment, solid\nwaste  management,  electricity  supply  and  distribution,  and  roads.  Problems  also  include\ndeficiencies  in  management  of  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  which  can  be  traced  to\ncapacities for planning and management.\n14. In many of the PDMCs, ADB\u2019s assistance has focused on WSS and housing. The main\nobjective of this study is to assess the extent to which ADB support in the form of TA and\nlending has contributed to building capacities for managing land use, urban utilities (for WSS),\nand housing. This will include analyzing the approach to assistance with corporatization and\nprivate sector participation, local community involvement, and environmental management. The\nstudy will focus on assistance to four countries, namely, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, and\nPapua New Guinea.\n15. Special Evaluation Study of Cost Recovery Policies in the Power Sector. ADB\u2019s\nenergy policy,4 emphasizes the need for highly efficient and financially robust energy sector\noperations, with a minimum of subsidies and cross-subsidies. It advocates the restructuring of\nvertically integrated electricity utilities to enhance competition and private sector participation,\nand  to  reduce  the  burden  on  public  sector  budgets.  A  common  element  in  ADB\u2019s  power\noperations has been policies directed at improving cost recovery, backed up through loan\ncovenants. Although a significant element in cost recovery policies is tariff levels and structures,\nsuch policies also address various aspects of power operations such as increased sales of\nelectricity, reductions in losses, and efficiency improvements, to reduce financial subsidies.\nImplementation  of  different  approaches  is  also  linked  to  changes  in  sector  governance,\nespecially the establishment of regulatory authorities and involvement of the private sector.\nDifferent approaches to cost recovery have been used that were considered appropriate to each\nDMC. However, compliance with cost recovery loan covenants, and improvements in cost\nrecovery, have been mixed.\n16. The main objectives of the study are to (i) assess the effectiveness of cost recovery\npolicies, including the use of performance benchmarks for improving financial viability, in the\npower sector in selected DMCs; (ii) assess the effectiveness of cost recovery covenants and\nother measures under ADB operations in improving cost recovery policies; and (iii) recommend\nappropriate cost recovery policies for the future, under different sector structures as found in\nthe region. The study will focus on cost recovery policies in the context of national or provincial\n                  \n4 IN.282-00: Energy 2000: Review of the Energy Policy of the Asian Development Bank, 8 December 2000.", "5\nlevel provision in different DMCs, which may include People\u2019s Republic of China, India, Nepal,\nand Viet Nam.\n17. Special Evaluation Study of Cofinancing Operations. Cofinancing of ADB operations\nincludes loan and grant financing associated with public sector projects, and loan financing\nassociated with private sector projects. Cofinancing has been mobilized from international and\ndomestic sources in significant amounts, and ADB administers many grant funds on behalf of\nother funding agencies. The context for cofinancing of ADB operations is changing. The poverty\nreduction strategy, announced in 1999, has led to a change in country strategies and in the mix\nof projects and programs being financed. Cofinancing is easier to identify and arrange for some\ntypes of project than others; cofinancing sources and amounts may change as a result of the\nchange in strategic direction. In addition, sources of funds for cofinancing of ADB operations,\nalthough showing increases in some special areas in the field of grant funding, are diminishing\nin the larger realm of loan cofinancing. Local currency cofinancing may play a greater role in the\nfuture.\n18. The main objectives of this special evaluation study are to assess (i) the impact of\ncofinancing on the achievement of ADB goals such as poverty reduction or stabilization of crisis\nconditions; (ii) the processes involved in arranging cofinancing of ADB operations, including the\nincentives and constraints for borrowers, confinanciers, and ADB; and (iii) the prospects for\ndifferent types of cofinancing, in the context of the private sector development and poverty\nreduction strategies. The study will encompass different types of cofinancing activities, and\nespecially the consequences for borrowers and recipients.\n19. Special  Evaluation  Study  of  the  Role  of  Aquaculture  Development  in  Poverty\nReduction.  Over  the  last  two  decades,  inland  and  coastal  aquaculture  has  reshaped  the\nfisheries sector in many DMCs in response to declining fish supplies from capture fisheries.\nAquaculture production has grown at 8-10 percent per annum, and in 1999 annual aquaculture\nproduction reached more than 30 million tons or a quarter of the total world fisheries production.\nIn many DMCs, aquaculture has merged with existing farming systems. It has stimulated rural\nentreprenuership, and offered promising opportunities for poverty reduction through increased\nincome and improved nutrition. Opportunities for sustained aquaculture development depend on\naccess to land and water resources, environmental and ecological factors, market opportunities,\ncapital and human resources, and other requisites for agribusiness development. Given the\ndiverse alternatives for aquaculture development, avenues for poverty reduction hinge on the\ntypes  and  characteristics  of  aquaculture  operations,  including  their  varying  utilization  of\ntechnology, labor and capital availability, and management requirements. ADB has assisted\nDMCs in aquaculture development both through dedicated projects and as part of broader\nagricultural or rural development activities.\n20. In the context of current and potential demands for aquaculture products, the main\nobjective of this special evaluation study is to assess the contribution of aquaculture to income\ngeneration, employment, and human nutrition. The study will identify aquaculture practices and\noperations suited for reducing rural poverty, and will examine major issues and challenges\nfacing  the  rural  poor  in  developing  viable  and  sustainable  aquaculture  operations.  Recent\ndevelopments in aquaculture technology and management will be reviewed, including their likely\nenvironmental effects, and case studies will be undertaken to understand the multidimensional\naspects of aquaculture development, including issues related to land tenure, access to water\nresources, marketing, capital requirements, and access to credit. The study will focus on past", "6\nand recent aquaculture development initiatives and investments, including those financed by\nADB, in three DMCs.\n21. Country Assistance Program Evaluation for Mongolia. Mongolia became a member\nof ADB in 1991. At that time, its economy was in crisis; its customary export markets had\ncollapsed, and yet it had significant international debts. Budget transfers from the former Soviet\nUnion had ceased, and there was no access to convertible currency. The consequences were\nrising unemployment, growing poverty, and a deterioration in previously high attainments in\nsocial development. Equally significant, there was little capacity for structured decision-making\nand economic management to counter these circumstances, and little experience with a market\neconomy.  As  with  former  Soviet  Union  countries,  Mongolia  faced  the  twin  problems  of\ndevelopment and transition. Production and incomes could be restored only through economic\ndiversification and by seeking new markets. New institutions needed to be created to replace\nthe previous system of centrally planned production and distribution. Since its operations began\nin 1991, ADB has approved loans to Mongolia totaling $480 million and TA totaling nearly $50\nmillion. The earlier country strategy documents emphasized the rehabilitation and development\nof infrastructure as a means of creating appropriate conditions for private sector development,\nas well as building capacities for a market economy. The latest country strategy document\nprepared  in  2000  places  greater  emphasis  on  governance  reforms  and  support  to  social\nservices including education, health, and urban development.\n22. The goal of the CAPE is to assess the extent to which ADB\u2019s country strategy and\nassistance program have contributed to the development strategy and objectives of Mongolia. It\nwill cover all ADB operations since 1991. The main objectives are to assess (i) the impact of\nassistance on the establishment of a policy and institutional framework for a market economy,\nand (ii) the impact of assistance on economic diversification and creation of new products and\nmarkets. This will include analyzing the consequences for budget priorities and poverty. In\nassessing the quality of the assistance program and its implementation and outcomes, the\nevaluation will focus particularly on issues of economic diversification, governance, capacity\nbuilding, and the financial sector. It will also include an assessment of ADB\u2019s responsiveness to\nchanging circumstances. Given the limited period of assistance to Mongolia, both ongoing and\ncompleted  operations  will  be  covered  to  provide  an  overall  assessment  of  the  efficacy,\nsustainability, and impact of the assistance program, and especially its relevance.\n23. Country Assistance Program Evaluation for Pakistan. Pakistan has a per capita\nincome of around $450 per annum. It still suffers from a high incidence of poverty and relatively\nlow social indicators. ADB has provided assistance to Pakistan since 1968. In the last 15 years,\nthis assistance has totaled $8.3 billion, of which $6.8 billion has gone to the agriculture, energy,\nsocial  infrastructure,  and  financial  sectors.  At  the  same  time,  the  form  of  assistance  has\nchanged toward greater emphasis on reform at the sector level, and on poverty reduction and\nthe  role  of  women.  ADB  assistance  to  Pakistan  has  been  coordinated  with  that  of  other\nagencies, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. It has been framed in\nthe context of country strategies formulated in 1985, 1990, and 1995, and of the country\noperational framework formulated in 1999. The successive country strategies have seen a shift\nfrom support focusing primarily on economic growth to greater support for poverty reduction,\nhuman  development,  environmental  protection,  good  governance,  and  private  sector\ndevelopment.", "7\n24. The  aim  of  this  CAPE  is  to  assess  the  extent  to  which  ADB\u2019s  operations  have\ncontributed to economic development and poverty reduction in Pakistan. It will cover the last 15\nyears, including all lending and nonlending services. The main objectives are to (i) evaluate the\nrelevance of ADB\u2019s country strategies and assistance program to Pakistan in the context of the\nmajor economic constraints the country has faced; (ii) assess the extent to which the assistance\nprogram  helped  in  achieving  the  government\u2019s  development  objectives;  (iii)  assess  the\nsustainability and impact of the changes brought about under the assistance program; and (iv)\nidentify issues, modalities, and sector focus for future operations. The evaluation will be based\non completed and ongoing operations and is expected to be completed in 2003.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n25. The TA is estimated to cost $1.6 million (Appendix 3). It will be financed by ADB on a\ngrant basis from the ADB-funded TA program.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n26. OED will implement the TA. A report will be prepared for each of the eight thematic\nevaluation  studies.  The  studies  will  be  carried  out  by  OED  staff,  with  the  assistance  of\ninternational and domestic consultants. Altogether, about 50 person-months of international\nconsulting and about 47 person-months of domestic consulting inputs will be required. The\nindividual areas of expertise, duration of engagement of consultants, and outline terms of\nreference are given in Appendix 4. In keeping with OED\u2019s practice, a position paper for each\nstudy outlining the detailed approach, methodology, and terms of reference will be prepared\nprior to engaging consultants and commencing the studies. Consultants will be selected and\nengaged according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB on the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. Operational\ndepartments  and  DMC  governments  will  be  consulted  at  all  stages  of  formulation  and\nimplementation. It is expected that the draft results of the studies will be discussed at in-country\nor combined workshops with government representatives and other key stakeholders. The TA\nwill commence in February 2002 and will be completed by the end of 2003.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION\n27. The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  the  provision  of  technical\nassistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $1,600,000 for the\npurpose of Thematic Evaluation Studies of Asian Development Bank Operations in Developing\nMember Countries.", "8\nAppendix 1, page 1\nOPERATIONS EVALUATION DEPARTMENT\n2002 WORK PROGRAM\nA.

Impact  Evaluation  Study  of  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Projects  in  Selected\nDeveloping Member Countries\n1. International Consultants\n1. Two international consultants will be recruited for a total of 6 person-months to provide\ninputs to the study. The consultants will have extensive experience in the design and operation\nof water supply and sanitation (WSS) projects, particularly relating to how provision affects the\npoor,  and  in  project  evaluation.  Working  in  separate  countries,  the  consultants  will  each\nundertake the following:\n(i) Based on documents and discussions with the Government and the executing\nagency, review and assess the WSS sector objectives and individual project\ndesign, implementation, and operations.\n(ii) Assist in formulating a methodology to be applied in assessing the impact of\nWSS projects. Organize the collection of primary data on the impact of each\nproject  on  users,  including  poor  households  in  particular,  and  on  broader\nsocioeconomic  impacts  attributable  to  the  project.  Review  the  environmental\nimpact of each project in the context of the relevant water sources. Assess the\nextent  and  quality  of  maintenance  and  its  funding,  and  the  sustainability  of\nproject impacts.\n(iii) Using primary and secondary data, prepare a report on the results of the impact\nevaluation for each project. Identify issues and lessons learned for enhancing the\nimpact  of  WSS  projects  in  the  future.  Assist  in  finalization  of  the  impact\nevaluation study report.\n2. Domestic Consultants\n2. Five domestic consultants will be recruited, one in each country, for a total of 6 person-\nmonths.
