The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is supporting subregional cooperation in eastern \nSouth Asia based on the establishment of the South Asian Growth Quadrangle, comprising \nBangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal (BBIN). Regional technical assistance (TA) has helped \nthe participating countries establish an institutional framework (a country advisers\u2019 group and \nsector working groups) through the South Asia Subregional Cooperation (SASEC) program.1 \nBBIN have identified tourism development as a priority for subregional cooperation, and ongoing \nTA supports the meetings of the tourism working group (TWG). Nepal chairs the TWG, which \nhas met three times since 2001, most recently in July 2003, in New Delhi, India. The TWG, at its \nsecond meeting, identified the preparation of a subregional tourism master plan as a priority \nprogram, and requested ADB for TA to support this.2 An advisory TA is, accordingly, included in \nthe  regional  cooperation  strategy  and  program  for  2003.3  The  third  meeting  of  the  TWG \ndiscussed  the  proposed  plan,  and  agreed  that  this  should  be  a  subregional  tourism \ndevelopment plan that builds upon master plans in the four countries. It was also agreed that \nthe planning should start with two common themes\u2014(i) ecotourism based on the natural and \ncultural heritage of the subregion and (ii) Buddhist circuits in BBIN\u2014and establish a thematic \nframework for tourism development. The plan will also outline an implementation program and \nhelp set the TWG\u2019s future agenda. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The World Tourism Organization (WTO) Tourism 2020 Vision forecasts that international \narrivals will reach over 1.56 billion by 2020. Of these, 1.18 billion will be intraregional and 380 \nmillion will be long-haul travelers. South Asia, which was one of the success stories of 2000, \nwith tourist arrivals growing by 11%, is forecast to record an average annual growth of 6.2% \nover 1995\u20132020, compared to the world average of 4.1%. WTO preliminary estimates show that \ninternational tourist arrivals in 2002 exceeded 700 million, an increase of 3.1% over the year, \ndemonstrating tourism\u2019s resilience in the face of geopolitical uncertainty and an overall weak \neconomy. However, growth was only 2% in South Asia. International tourism arrivals in South \nAsia made up only less than 1% of the world total.4  \n \n3.  The  World  Travel  and  Tourism  Council  (WTTC)  estimates  the  economic  value  of \npersonal travel and tourism in South Asia at $18.7 billion in 2003, growing by 7.3% per annum \nin real terms.5 By 2013 this is projected to reach $52.2 billion but would still be only a small \nfraction of world travel and tourism, projected at $3,862 billion by 2013. The overall economic \nimpact of travel and tourism in South Asia is expected to contribute 4.8% to gross domestic \nproduct(GDP) in 2003, rising to 5.3% in 2013. The industry is projected to provide employment \nto about 29 million people (5.2% of the total) in 2003, and to almost 36 million (5.4%) in 2013. \nWTTC also monitors competitiveness indicators to assess to what extent a country offers a \n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2000.

Available:  http://www.world-tourism.org. WTO compiles statistics from all \ncountries, and periodically undertakes more detailed analyses of regional tourism market trends. Country statistics \nprimarily come from immigration department records. South Asian statistics on interregional travel are reliable \nsince border procedures are tight. Intraregional and domestic tourism statistics may, however, vary in availability \nand quality. \n5  WTTC. 2003. India Travel & Tourism\u2014A World of Opportunity. London. Available: http://www.wttc.org  ", "2 \ncompetitive environment for travel and tourism development. While South Asian countries rank \nhigh on price competitiveness, they rank low on other indicators such as (i) level of basic \ninfrastructure  development,  (ii)  awareness  of  environmental  aspects  of  development,  (iii) \nadvances in modern technological systems and infrastructure, (iv) human resources in tourism \nactivity, (v) tourism openness (including visa requirements), and (vi) social development. \n \n4.  Geographically,  ecologically,  and  culturally  diverse,  SASEC  is  very  attractive  to \ninternational tourists. Its tourism resources range from the world\u2019s highest mountain peaks in \nNepal, to the vast cultural and physical diversity of India, the world\u2019s longest sea beach and \nlargest mangrove forest in Bangladesh, and the serene and beautiful mountain kingdom of \nBhutan.  SASEC  already  receives  more  than  3  million  international  visitors  per  year,  each \nspending on average $1,073 per visit. In 2000 the combined total revenue from international \ntourists in the subregion was $3,531 million.6 The subregion also has tourist source markets of \nits own. Indian outbound tourists ranked first among tourist arrivals of all three neighbors, \naccounting for 28% of total tourist arrivals to these countries in 2000. The heads of tourism in \nBBIN agree that intraregional travel will be at least as significant as interregional travel to the \nfuture growth of tourism in the subregion. \n \n5.  As  well  as  bringing  in  foreign  exchange,  creating  jobs,  and  contributing  to  overall \neconomic growth, SASEC tourism is particularly attractive as it promotes rural development. \nThe subregion has styles of tourism such as overland cultural tours and mountain trekking that \nare suitable to spread benefits of tourism to the rural poor. The world\u2019s leading examples of \ndevelopment programs using ecotourism to reduce rural poverty have come from the subregion. \nADB\u2019s experience of supporting ecotourism development in Nepal has shown that community-\nbased tourism can help reduce poverty and conserve the natural and cultural heritage.7 Project \nimpacts include (i) increased employment, although seasonal; (ii) increased community capacity \nto manage small enterprises; (iii) increased food production due to additional tourist demand; \nand  (iv)  improved  maintenance  of  local  infrastructure  (e.g.,  campsites  and  trails)  through \ncommunity  participation.  ADB\u2019s  approach  has  combined  improving  airport  infrastructure  in \nremote rural areas with using locally developed training techniques to enable villagers to benefit \nfrom  the  resulting  increased  tourist  flows.  Opportunities  for  this  type  of  approach  occur \nthroughout the subregion, building upon lessons learned from experience.8 \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s experience in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) has illustrated tourism\u2019s \ngreat potential as a sector for subregional cooperation. Cooperation among the six countries in \nGMS created the Mekong region, in which the whole has become greater than the sum of its \nparts. The TWG is aware of the potential for a similar South Asia region. The TWG\u2019s Tourism \nSector Working Group Report and Pre-investment Survey created this awareness and instilled \nin SASEC countries a strong willingness to cooperate.9 However, hurdles must be overcome. As \nwith GMS at the outset, one significant hurdle is the lack of a subregional perspective in tourism \nplanning. Until now, no one has had reason to look beyond national borders to identify patterns \nof tourism in the subregion and the potential to influence and enhance them. A subregional view \nof tourism plans in the four countries is required, drawing comparisons across borders and \nidentifying opportunities for joint development and marketing of shared resources. \n \n                                                 \n6  TWG report and survey (footnote 2). \n7  ADB.  1992.

The TWG report and survey established the general issues and constraints, and also \nidentified development opportunities and project ideas based on the countries\u2019 development \npriorities. The success of the TWG\u2019s programs will depend on the following: (i) the will to work \ntogether; (ii) thematically packaged quality tourism products; (iii) a strong network of air, road, \nand rail access; (iv) easy visa and other facilitation formalities; and (v) a workforce able to \nimplement the programs.  \n \n8.  Besides subregional tourism planning, the TWG report and survey also recommended (i) \nestablishing a SASEC tourism secretariat in one country; (ii) a joint marketing and promotional \nprogram; (iii) a common SASEC visa; (iv) key development projects to ensure good access by \nair, road, rail, and river; (v) a subregional human resource development study; (vi) a program of \nthematic tours; and (vii) use of the New Asian Highway (Singapore to Turkey) as the backbone \nfor overland travel in BBIN. The TWG has narrowed its marketing focus to \u201cecotourism based on \nnatural and cultural heritage of the subregion\u201d and \u201cBuddhist circuits in BBIN.\u201d A subregional \ntourism development plan is required to refine and prioritize projects on these themes, and to \ncreate a framework program and plan of action for the TWG. Such cooperative planning will \nfacilitate and enable tourism growth in South Asia. \n \n9.  Regional groupings such as the Agency for Coordinating Mekong Tourism Activities and \nSouth  Pacific  Tourism  Organization  combine  resources  for  cost-effective  joint  marketing \ninitiatives  as  well  as  market  research  and  analyses.  As  illustrated  in  GMS,  subregional \ndestination marketing can be effective and produce great efficiencies of scale. The subregional \ntourism development plan will identify projects for joint destination marketing aimed at intra- and \ninterregional tourist markets. The need to upgrade the quality of tourism products will be met \nthrough projects involving public-private partnerships in infrastructure, promoting links between \ntourism and the conservation of the cultural and physical environment, and overcoming human \nresource  development  constraints  through  joint  training  of  trainers.  Opportunities  will  be \nidentified to create an enabling environment for growth through public-private partnerships and \ndeveloping mechanisms to facilitate private sector investment in tourism development. \n \n10.  The TWG has confirmed the basic strategic objectives for subregional cooperation in \ntourism: (i) develop a cooperative spirit among the tourism industries of the subregion, (ii) \ncontribute to sustainable economic growth, (iii) use ecotourism to reduce poverty, (iv) create \njobs, and (v) facilitate private sector investment in tourism.10 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The TA\u2019s purpose is to prepare, with active participation of BBIN\u2019s tourism sectors, a \nSASEC tourism development plan (TDP) that will provide a thematic framework of programs \nand projects for future subregional cooperation activities of the TWG. The TA will help achieve, \nthrough subregional cooperation, significant growth in tourism, leading to overall economic \ngrowth and reduction of rural poverty in SASEC. \n \n12.  The main output will be a SASEC TDP for 2004\u20132014, which will include (i) a framework \nprogram under which TWG activities will be structured around the two themes, (ii) specific \nproject ideas and concept plans for appropriate tourism development in key areas where \n                                                 \n10  SASEC Tourism Working Group. 2003.

Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA\u2019s participatory approach will involve the tourism industry\u2019s public and private \nsectors and other stakeholders in developing a framework program and project concepts. After \nsome initial research, national workshops with the tourism industry and stakeholders will be held \nin each SASEC country, hosted by the national tourism organizations (NTOs). Draft project \nideas for marketing, infrastructure, human resource development, facilitation of travel, key area \ndevelopment,  and  development  mechanisms  will  be  debated  and  agreed  on  at  these \nworkshops. Later, the TWG will participate in a subregional workshop at which draft results of \nthe study, including an outline action plan, will be presented and discussed. The subregional \nworkshop will also debate and agree on the future program, roles, and procedures of the \nworking group. \n \n14.  The TA will (i) review and build on SASEC tourism planning to date; (ii) analyze existing \nsubregional  tourism  markets,  marketing,  product  demand  and  supply,  cost  and  quality \ncompetitiveness, and constraints on tourism growth; (iii) review national, state, and district \nplans, priorities, and institutional frameworks for tourism development, with particular reference \nto the two themes;11 (iv) consider other national policies, laws, and regulations across sectors \nthat may affect, or be affected by, the economic, social, and ecological impacts of tourism \ndevelopment;  (v)  identify  and  coordinate  with  prospective  partner  agencies,  including \ndevelopment partners; (vi) identify key tourism resources shared by countries, and prepare \nconcept plans for tourism development associated with these; (vii) prepare a draft framework \nprogram and project ideas for discussion with stakeholders, to evolve a widely accepted final \noutput;  (viii)  outline  cost-effective  ways  to  promote  the  themes  to  intra- and interregional \nmarkets through joint destination marketing; (ix) identify, according to agreed-on screening and \nselection criteria, project ideas to develop physical infrastructure to facilitate tourism growth, \ngiving highest priority to projects shared by countries; (x) identify human resource development \nneeds and propose a program to train trainers in tourism, covering government agencies, the \nprivate sector, entrepreneurs, and communities; (xi) identify needed improvements in tourism \nfacilities at border crossings and other improvements to facilitate travel; (xii) outline subregional \nguidelines for tourism development, including criteria for a subregional code of conduct and \ngood  practice  for  the  tourism  industry;  ways  to  ensure  sustainable  development  and \nmanagement of tourism in protected areas; and ways to protect and enhance the rights of \nindigenous  people,  particularly  those  living  in  border  areas;  (xiii)  develop  mechanisms, \nespecially financial ones, to facilitate private sector investment in tourism development, and \nways to link the private sector with communities; (xiv) prepare an action plan to implement the \nframework program, basic guidelines for each country\u2019s participation, and a timeframe for \nimplementation; (xv) recommend roles and procedures for the TWG and other key players in \nimplementation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, and will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. Details of the cost estimates are given in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n11  For example, Royal Government of Bhutan. 2001.  Bhutan National Ecotourism Strategy.
