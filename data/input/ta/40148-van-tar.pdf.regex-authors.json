The Government of Vanuatu requested technical assistance (TA) to expand access to \nfinancial services for its rural population with Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing. This \nassistance1  is  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  Priorities  and  Action  Agenda,2  which \nencourages  economic  growth,  addresses  low  private  sector  investment,  and  reduces \nunemployment. It is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy 2005\u20132009, and is included in \nthe country strategy and program update 2006\u20132009.3 ADB\u2019s strategy for Vanuatu includes \naddressing fundamental constraints to sustainable private sector-led economic growth, with a \nfocus on increasing access to finance. The Government concurs with the TA's methodology, key \nactivities,  implementation  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.  A  memorandum  of \nunderstanding was signed by the Government, ADB, and the National Bank of Vanuatu (NBV) \non 25 July 2007. The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  A major impediment to the development of local enterprises in Vanuatu is the restricted \naccess to financial services, particularly in rural areas. ADB has previously provided assistance4 \nto support sustainable microfinance activities through the government-owned NBV. The initial \npilot TA was scaled up through the extension of banking services, including commercially-viable \nmicrofinance, through NBV branches on the outer islands. However, this expansion over the past \n4  years  can  no  longer  provide  cost-effective outreach.  To  serve  smaller  and  more  remote \npopulations, new and innovative approaches are required. From previous TA, other lessons \nlearned include the need to combine both policy and operational activities with NBV, and the \nneed for flexibility in implementing the TA. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Vanuatu has experienced both rapid population growth and\u2014until recently\u2014a long period \nof sluggish economic growth. As a result, the current real per capita income is lower than it was \n20 years ago. Vanuatu is the third poorest country in the Pacific with a rising human poverty \nindex of 24.7, ranking it 49th out of 102 developing countries and areas.5 It has a population of \n229,000, 76% of which live in rural areas. Currently, only 13% of the rural adult population have \nbank accounts, and an estimated 92,000 need financial services.6\n \n4.  Without  access  to  secure  and  convenient  financial  services,  many  rural  households \nremain dependant on subsistence farming, limiting their participation in the formal economy and \ntheir ability to increase their contribution toward economic growth. For example, those in isolated \nand remote communities throughout the country\u2019s outer islands, without bank accounts, may \nstore money in unsecure locations. Also in remote areas, government workers and teachers, \nwho  receive  salary  payments  into  their  bank  accounts,  often  must  make  expensive,  time-\n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 30 July 2007. \n2   Government of Vanuatu. 2006.

Its new strategic priorities are consistent with those in the previous action agendas as well as \nthe Comprehensive Reform Program. \n3   ADB. 2006.

New York. \n6   These figures are based on the following analysis. In 2007, Vanuatu\u2019s estimated population is 229,000, with around \n76% living in rural areas, e.g., outside Port Vila and Luganville. About 60% of the population is above the age of 15 \nand may need a bank account. NBV has only about 12,000 account holders in rural areas and is the only bank with \na presence in these areas. \n ", "2   \nconsuming inter-island journeys to the nearest NBV bank branch to access their income. In \naddition, the provision of credit, if it exists at all, is mainly through commodity traders or local \nstores and largely outside the financial sector. Not surprisingly, levels of financial literacy in such \nareas remain low. \n \n5.  The two large international commercial banks in the country, ANZ and Westpac, focus \nalmost exclusively on the two urban centers of Port Vila and Luganville, although ANZ has \nrecently introduced a banking van to provide mobile banking services to rural areas on the main \nisland of Efate. In addition, there are several microfinance providers, but their operations are \nlargely  urban-based.  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  supports  the  Vanuatu \nWomen\u2019s Development Scheme, a modified Grameen Bank replication targeted at low-income \nurban women. This scheme has been successful in developing micro-saving and micro-credit \nschemes, but is not financially sustainable and has yet to achieve a scale of operations that \nwould enable it to function outside urban areas. The Melanesian Cooperative Savings and Loan \nSociety also operates mainly in urban areas, targeting salaried workers.  \n6.  Two new entities may impact rural banking in the medium term. First, a new commercial \nbank, BRED (Vanuatu), a subsidiary of the French bank La Bred Banque Populaire, is currently \nsetting up operations that will most likely focus on Port Vila. Second, a 2006 act established the \nVanuatu Agriculture Development Bank, but to date, the bank has not been funded or staffed, \nalthough steps to achieve these goals are expected within the next year. \n7.  Presently, NBV is the key provider of rural financial services. It is the only domestic-\nowned bank in Vanuatu, except for the Agriculture Development Bank, which still at the concept \nstage. Although government-owned, NBV operates on a fully commercial basis with professional \nmanagement brought in from overseas. Since the late 1990s, NBV has progressively achieved \nconsistent profit growth, a sound financial structure, and a good quality loan portfolio. It has \nexpanded to 21 branches throughout the country, and with support from previous ADB TAs, has \ndeveloped a microfinance loan product with consistent high repayment rates, making a positive \ncontribution to its profits. As of 30 June 2007, NBV\u2019s microfinance loan portfolio was comprised \nof 542 loans, totaling Vt105 million ($1 million equivalent). Microfinance loans with arrears of \nmore than 60 days were equivalent to only 0.6% of this portfolio. While the microfinance portfolio \nis small\u2014equivalent to only 3% of NBV\u2019s total loan portfolio\u2014it is still larger than that of other \nmicrofinance  operations  within  the  country.  Deposits  mobilized  by  NBV  in  rural  areas  are \napproximately Vt540 million ($5.4 million equivalent). \n8.  NBV is committed to further expanding its services to isolated and remote communities \nthroughout the country\u2019s outer islands. However, the costs involved in setting up branches to \nserve smaller markets are prohibitive. Accordingly, NBV has been investigating the possibility of \nusing alternative branchless business models to increase its outreach in a cost-effective and \nsustainable manner.   \n9.  Recent international experience has demonstrated that new technologies and business \nmodels can provide opportunities for agent-assisted branchless banking to reach the poorest \nsectors of society. The proposed business model to be introduced by NBV\u2014expanding outreach \nthrough bank agents equipped with new technology\u2014has been applied in several countries. \nBrazil, for example, has 90,000 such bank agents. Over the past decade, experience in applying \ntechnology to microfinance operations has also been gained in Uganda and the Philippines. \nAlthough  there  is  experience  in  other  countries  with  branchless  banking,  there  are  no \ninternational examples that incorporate remote banking technologies and agent models with \ndispersed islands and remote populations. Customizing the mix of established technologies for \nVanuatu  is  therefore  essential,  while  taking  into  account  the  local  telecommunication  and \nelectricity infrastructure. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n \n10.  The TA will increase the availability and utilization of sustainable financial services to the \nrural population in order to boost its participation in income-generating activities that contribute to \neconomic growth. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will support NBV by introducing a new business model of bank agents in rural \ncommunities beyond the reach of present NBV branches. Equipped with appropriate technology \nand communications equipment, these agents will enable much of the presently unbanked rural \npopulation to establish and operate savings accounts and utilize account transaction facilities \nconveniently.  \n \n12.  In a typical example, a person living in a remote area opens an account and is issued an \nelectronic funds transfer point of sale (eftPOS) card. The bank client then makes a deposit, \nwithdrawal, or payment to another account by presenting the card to an agent\u2014a local store \nowner\u2014who swipes the card on an eftPOS device, which is connected via cell phone to the \nbank\u2019s system by a special purpose router known as a switch. The bank\u2019s system approves the \ntransaction, and the agent exchanges any cash with the client and provides a record with a \nconfirmation  code.  The  bank\u2019s  system  then  adjusts  the  client\u2019s  and  the  agent\u2019s  accounts. \nPeriodically, the agent travels to a bank branch to manage cash on hand with the agent. In a \nvariation of this model, a client may use a cell phone to check account balances, make payments \nto other accounts, or receive confirmation of a deposit to an agent. \n \n13.  The regulatory framework for commercial banks authorizes the central bank, the Reserve \nBank of Vanuatu (RBV), to supervise bank agents in their deposit-taking role. After consulting \nRBV, there are presently no legal or regulatory impediments to the bank agent model. Although \nRBV is supportive of the concept, NBV must ensure that appropriate systems and controls are \ninstituted to meet ongoing supervisory requirements when instituting this model. \n \n14.  The telecommunications situation in Vanuatu is characterized by relatively low levels of \naccess outside of the main population centers, and by high costs. Over time, unmet demand and \nan incumbent monopoly are likely to give way to a more competitive market and increased \ncoverage.  Nevertheless,  remote  communications  will  remain  a  challenge,  and  the  available \noptions must be carefully weighed for this project to succeed. Options include the fixed line \nnetwork, (Global System for Mobile communications) (cellular), and VSAT (Very Small Aperture \nTerminal) and Iridium (satellite-based). The non-fixed line options may be more costly, but there \nare at least some telecommunication options available for the country\u2019s most remote areas. \n \n15.  To mitigate the risks involved in introducing an innovative, branchless banking system, a \nfour-phase program is planned for the TA. The TA will provide assistance to NBV during the first \nthree phases over a period of 30 months. \n \n(i)  Phase I: Business development. Over 3 months, a detailed investigation and \nanalysis  of  the  business  case  will  be  undertaken.  This will  include  a  market \nassessment; financial modeling; development of an agent business model; and a \ndetailed  assessment  of  technology  options  covering  field  devices  for  agents, \ntelecommunications links, and their integration into NBV\u2019s core banking system. \n ", "4   \nThe cost of various telecommunication options is expected to be a key issue in \nthe  evaluation  and  selection  of  technology.  Regulatory  issues  will  also  be \naddressed. This phase\u2019s outcome will encompass decisions on the technology, \nevaluation, and selection of hardware and software providers, and finalization of \npilot stage design. \n(ii)  Phase II: Technology implementation. This 3-month period will result in the \ndelivery and integration of head office hardware and software, delivery of pilot \nfield equipment such as eftPOS devices and cards, and completion of testing and \nvalidation of all field and head office equipment and systems.  \n(iii)  Phase III: Pilot program. A 24-month pilot program will result in a target 12 \nagents in operation. The agents\u2019 selection and location will focus on testing the \neffectiveness  of  the  agent  model  under  a  variety  of  conditions,  e.g.,  various \nmarkets, customer education approaches, technology choices, types and quality \nof telecommunications, and electricity supply. The pilot experience will enable \ndesign of the final scale-up model. As part of the pilot program, NBV\u2019s capacity to \nselect and train agents will be developed, and a financial awareness and literacy \nprogram will be carried out in pilot areas. \n(iv)  Phase IV: Scale-up. Thanks to the pilot experience, several procedures and \nbusiness operations will be formalized, e.g., procedures and operating manuals \nfor agents; the basis for selection, training, remuneration, monitoring, and control \nof agents; and customer education and marketing programs. The scale-up and \ntraining of agents will occur progressively over several years, with potential for \n80\u2013100  agents  in  operation  within  5  years,  providing  40%\u201350%  of  the  rural \npopulation with access to financial services.  \n \n16.  There  is  confidence  that  workable  technology  solutions  will  be  available  for  NBV, \nnotwithstanding the challenging status of the country\u2019s infrastructure. Cost estimates will be \nexplored in detail in phase I, with the cost of telephone calls for data communication between the \nagent eftPOS and NBV core banking system significantly impacting the model\u2019s attractiveness to \nboth agent and client. Thus, the rate of model\u2019s adoption and progress are presently difficult to \nassess accurately. \n \n17.  In the next few years, there is limited potential for increased competition with NBV in the \ndelivery of financial services to rural areas due to outreach costs. Contributing to increased \nfinancial literacy will also be an important part of the TA, including the concepts of borrowing and \nrepayment, interest rates and cost recovery, and sustainable investing.  \n \n18.  The TA will be closely coordinated with ADB\u2019s ongoing TA in Vanuatu, particularly for \nsecured transactions reform and support to the Financial Services Commission.7  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The  TA\u2019s  total  cost  is  estimated  to  be  $750,000  equivalent,  with  the  Government \nrequesting that ADB finance $600,000 equivalent. This TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. NBV will finance the balance of \nthe  local  currency  cost,  equivalent  to  $150,000,  through  counterpart  staff  salaries,  office \naccommodation, and other support services. \n \n                                                 \n7   ADB. 2006.

Technical Assistance to the Republic of Vanuatu for \nSecured Transactions Reforms. Manila (TA 4457-VAN). \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic  Management  (MFEM)  will  be  the  Executing \nAgency, and NBV will be the Implementing Agency. NBV will appoint a senior executive as \nproject manager responsible for project development and implementation. The project manager \nwill report directly to NBV\u2018s managing director, and will coordinate with its senior management \nteam and the consultants. NBV will also provide office space and support services for the \nconsultants. MFEM must supervise the TA\u2019s implementation and ensure its effectiveness. MFEM \nand NBV will hold regular meetings to ensure that MFEM is kept informed and the project \nremains on target. \n \n21.  It is anticipated that a total 10 person-months in international consulting services will be \nrequired for the TA\u2019s implementation. Due to the high level of NBV staff involvement in project \nmanagement and implementation, there is no requirement for national consultants. \n \n22.  Beginning in March 2008, the TA will be implemented over a total of 30 months to \nSeptember 2010, with intermittent inputs from three international consultants. The consultant \nteam will be drawn from a firm with expertise in the development and application of technology in \nmicrofinance enterprises. The consulting team will be comprised of a microfinance development \nexpert  (4  person-months),  a  microfinance  technology  expert  (4  person-months),  and  a \nmicrofinance education and training expert (2 person-months). The team of consultants will be \nselected  as  an  international  team  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). All equipment purchased under the TA, including eftPOS devices, cards, and associated \nsoftware, will also be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). The equipment will remain with NBV following the TA\u2019s completion. Several \nworkshops and seminars will be held under the TA to provide training for NBV staff and agents \nand  build  community  awareness  and  financial  literacy.  Administration  of  the  seminar  and \nworkshop survey funds will occur under the international consulting firm contract. Consulting \nfirms will be requested to submit simplified technical proposals. The ratio for the selection of the \nfirm will be 80% quality and 20% cost. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n23.
