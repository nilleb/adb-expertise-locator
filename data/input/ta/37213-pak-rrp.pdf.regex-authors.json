The President would \napprove the TA in the event that the Board of Directors of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) approves the program cluster and the loans. \n   \nClassification  Targeting Classification: General intervention \nSector: Law, economic management, and public policy \nSubsector: Public finance and expenditure management \nThemes:  Governance,  private  sector  development,  inclusive  social \ndevelopment \nSubthemes:  Public  governance,  policy/institutional/legal/regulatory \nreforms, human development \n   \nEnvironment  Category C \nAssessment \n   \nSocial Safeguard  Involuntary resettlement: Category C \nAssessment  Impact on indigenous people: Category C \nNo involuntary resettlement or impact on indigenous people is expected \nfrom program implementation. \n   \nRationale  Balochistan  is  the  largest  province  in  Pakistan  in  terms  of  land  area, \ncovering 44% of the country. Yet, it accounts only for 5% of Pakistan\u2019s \npopulation or 8 million people. The province is rich in natural resources, \nparticularly in minerals. With 1,100 kilometers of coastline, it also has the \npotential  to  be  an  international  trade  corridor.  However,  these \nendowments are largely untapped. The provincial economy has remained \nlargely agricultural, with crops and livestock contributing about 65% of the \nprovincial gross domestic product (GDP). Agriculture growth has been \nconstrained, however, due to perennial water scarcity and Balochistan\u2019s \ntopography, characterized by mountainous terrain. Only a third of the land \narea is productive agricultural and grazing land. Industry is rudimentary \nand accounts for only 10% of provincial GDP. As a result, Balochistan has \nhad  the  weakest  economic  performance  among  the  four  provinces  of \nPakistan. Between FY1973 and FY2005, the economy grew at an average \nannual rate of 4.2%\u2014or 0.7 percentage points lower than North-West \nFrontier Province and Sindh, and 1.0 percentage point lower than Punjab. \nIn 2005, annual per capita income was $410, only two-thirds the national \nlevel and slightly more than half the level of Punjab and Sindh. \n \nBalochistan faces both exogenous and endogenous challenges. Its large \nlandmass,  scattered  population,  and  extremely  low  population  density \ntranslate into high costs to deliver public services, lack of economies of \nscale  in  public  spending,  and  segmented  factor  and  output  markets. ", " ii \nCompounding  these  issues  are  weak  government  mechanisms  for \nplanning and fiduciary control, resulting in waste and inefficient allocation \nof  resources.  In  addition,  the  government  of  Balochistan  (GOB)  is \nresource constrained. Its own-source revenue generation is low, and the \nprovince depends heavily on federal transfers. The province suffers from \nchronic fiscal deficits, resulting in mounting overdrafts with the central \nbank. \n \nThe lack of private sector participation in the development process further \nhurts growth prospects. While the province is rich in minerals, the private \nsector plays a limited role in the sector. The entry barriers are significant, \nand these are aggravated by poor physical infrastructure and adverse \nsecurity conditions. \n \nThe GOB has recognized these challenges, and has made improving its \nfiscal management the top priority. The government will take steps to \nshore  up  its  own-source  revenues,  as  well  as  strive  to  obtain  the \nprovince\u2019s  financial  share  from  the  federal  Government.  In  parallel,  it \nneeds  to  strengthen  expenditure  management  through  prudent  fiscal \npolicy, controls to limit waste in current expenditures, and adoption of a \nrealistic public sector development program. Expenditures at all levels will \nneed to be rationalized to ensure that public spending does not exceed \nresources, and does not cause excessive deficit financing. The GOB also \nrecognizes the vast potential of the minerals sector, and the need to bring \ninvestments into the sector. \n \nIn the areas of fiscal decentralization, public resource management, and \nsocial  service  delivery,  ADB  has  supported  Balochistan  through  the \nDecentralization  Support  Program,  Balochistan  Public  Resource \nManagement  Program,  and  Balochistan  Devolved  Social  Services \nProgram. The GOB has requested ADB support for its agenda through the \nproposed  BRMP  II  to  deepen  these  reforms,  particularly  in  resource \nmobilization. \n   \nProgram  The  long-term  impact  of  BRMP  II  is  higher  and  sustained  economic \nDescription  growth.  The  outcome  of  BRMP  II  will  be  improved  public  resource \nmanagement, characterized by higher own-source revenues and greater \nefficiency  in  resource  allocation  and  utilization.  Better  public  resource \nmanagement  also  entails  improving  governance  in  key  sectors  in \nBalochistan,  such  as  the  minerals  sector,  to  allow  sustainable \ndevelopment, which generates more fiscal resources, creates jobs, raises \nincomes, and reduces poverty. This is to be achieved through reforms that \nwill  expand  resources,  enhance  fiduciary  controls  and  safeguards, \nimprove fiscal planning and coordination, and improve governance and \nenvironmental safeguards in the minerals sector. \n \nBRMP II will assist the GOB to (i) improve public financial management, \n(ii) develop an affordable and sustainable pension and employee benefit \nsystem,  and  (iii) enhance  government\u2019s  role  as  facilitator  of  minerals \nsector growth. The details are as follows: \n \n ", "  iii\n(i)  Improved  public  financial  management.  BRMP  II  will \nhelp the government improve tax administration, implement \nbetter revenue and budget planning and monitoring, and \nstrengthen internal controls. \n(ii)  An affordable and sustainable pension and employee \nbenefit system. BRMP II will help the government develop \neffective  governance  and  investment  structures  for  the \npension and general provident investment funds, improve \npension  administration,  and  streamline  the  pension  and \nemployee benefit system. \n(iii)  Enhanced role as facilitator of minerals sector growth. \nBRMP II will help the government build capacity in contract \nnegotiations, apply environmental safeguards in line with \nbest  practices,  and  improve  governance  with  greater \ntransparency in mineral receipts and assignment of mining \nclaims. \n   \nLoan Amounts  The proposed program cluster consists of two subprograms. Two loans, \nand Terms  totaling $100 million, will help finance subprogram 1 of BRMP II. The first \nloan of $45 million will be financed from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank \noffered rate-based lending facility; a term of 15 years, including a grace \nperiod  of  3  years;  and  other  terms  and  conditions  substantially  in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  program  loan  agreement.  The \nsecond loan of $55 million will be financed from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources, with an annual interest rate of 1% during the grace period and \n1.5% thereafter; a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as set forth in the program loan \nagreement. \n \nThe Government of Pakistan will relend the local currency generated from \nthe proceeds of the loan to the GOB. The terms and conditions will be the \nsame as those extended by ADB to the Government of Pakistan. The \nGovernment of Pakistan will assume the foreign exchange risk. \n \nSubprogram  2  of  BRMP  II  is  also  expected  to  involve  a  loan  of \n$100 million, subject to reform progress, and resource requirements and \navailability.  \n   \nCounterpart  The GOB will ensure that the local currency counterpart funds generated \nFunds  by the loans will be used to support essential reform requirements as well \nas  to  finance  general  development  expenditures.  Specifically,  funds \ngenerated from the ordinary capital resources loan as well as the Asian \nDevelopment Fund loan will be used to capitalize the pension and general \nprovident investment funds. A part of the resources generated from the \nAsian Development Fund loan will be used to supplement development \nspending in districts through a performance grant system and program \nimplementation. \n   \nProgram Period  The Program cluster covers the period from November 2007 to June 2010. \nand Tranches  The  implementation  period  for  subprogram  1  is  November  2007  to \n ", " iv \nDecember 2008. The loan proceeds will be available for withdrawal in a \nsingle tranche of $100 million for subprogram 1, and will be released after \nall the prior actions in the subprogram policy matrix are met and after the \nloans become effective. The report and recommendation of the President \nfor  subprogram  2  will  be  submitted  for  Board  consideration  about  18 \nmonths after the subprogram 1 loans become effective, subject to the \nreadiness of the GOB to continue with its reform agenda. \n   \nExecuting  The Executing Agency for BRMP II will be the Finance Department. The \nAgency and  implementing agencies for subprogram 1 will be Board of Revenue, Excise \nImplementation  and  Taxation  Department,  Finance  Department,  Mines  and  Minerals \nArrangements  Department  and  Planning  and  Development  Department.  A  high-level \nsteering committee will be chaired by the chief secretary and comprise as \nmembers an additional chief secretary (development), finance secretary, \nsenior member of the Board of Revenue, secretary of Excise and Taxation \nDepartment, and secretary of the Mines and Minerals Department. The \nfinance secretary will serve as secretary-member of the committee. The \nsteering committee is envisaged to (i) increase government ownership of \nthe program, (ii) facilitate better program implementation, and (iii) provide \nprogram oversight to achieve the reforms envisaged under BRMP II. \n \nA program coordination unit (PCU) within the Finance Department will be \nestablished,  headed  by  a  senior  officer  with  the  rank  of  at  least  an \nadditional secretary. The PCU will coordinate and monitor the day-to-day \nimplementation of the reform agenda of BRMP II. The head of the PCU \nwill report directly to the finance secretary. Each implementing agency will \nappoint a focal person to coordinate with the head of the PCU in achieving \nthe reform agenda under BRMP II.  \n   \nProcurement  and  The loan proceeds will finance the foreign exchange costs (excluding local \nDisbursement  duties and taxes) of items produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member \ncountries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  from  other \nbilateral and multilateral sources. ADB will have the right to audit the use \nof  the  loan  proceeds  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Borrower\u2019s \ncertification.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Borrower \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and \nRelated Requirements for Program Loans (1998). \n   \nBenefits and  BRMP  II  outcomes  will  help  the  GOB  address  some  of  the  binding \nBeneficiaries  constraints on economic growth by allowing for more efficient use of public \nresources, and paving the way for greater private investment, especially in \nthe  minerals  sector.  BRMP  II  will  help  the  GOB  apply  environmental \nsafeguards in line with best practices to ensure sustainability of growth of \nthe minerals sector. Subprogram 1 of BRMP II will aim to address the \nrevenue dimensions first to allow the GOB to obtain tangible results with \nits  limited  capacity  and  provide  a  sound  basis  for  more  far-reaching \nreforms. Improved public resource management will create the necessary \nfiscal space and discipline to allow more spending on social services in the \nfuture. \n \n \n ", "  v\nPart of the loan proceeds will be used to meet the mounting pension \nliabilities in the province. The accumulation under the pension and general \nprovident investment funds will allow part of the accrued pension and \ngeneral provident fund liabilities to be pre-funded; as such, in the medium \nand long term more fiscal space will be created to finance social services \nand development spending. Pension reform will also benefit current and \nfuture pensioners by ensuring that future pension payments will be met by \na system with greater funding. The remaining loan proceeds will be used \nfor development spending through the system of performance grants to \nlocal governments. Under the devolved structure, this translates into better \neducation and health services in the districts, and improvements in water \nand sanitation services in subdistricts and villages. \n   \nRisks and  The benefits to be realized under BRMP II will be contingent on a number \nAssumptions  of assumptions and will be subject to risks. Therefore, mitigating measures \nhave been integrated into the design of the Program. \n \nMacroeconomic Risks. Pakistan\u2019s economy remains vulnerable to short-\nterm shocks as well as medium-term macroeconomic imbalances. Growth \nwill slow down in 2008-2009, and recovery will be contingent on domestic \nas well as global factors. The Government has launched a medium-term \nstabilization program with support from development partners. ADB is a \nlead  partner  through  its  support  under  the  Accelerating  Economic \nTransformation Program. This 4-year program cluster aims to facilitate the \nstructural  transformation  of  Pakistan\u2019s  economy,  leading  to  sustained \neconomic growth of 8% per year between 2010 and 2020. \n \nSecurity and Political Risks. Continued reports of instability, attacks, \nplots, bombings, and even less-destructive activities such as protests and \nwork stoppages affect investors\u2019 views of the country\u2019s overall stability. \nThese  perceptions  affect  Balochistan  even  more,  given  the  security \nconcerns in the province. Balochistan\u2019s borders with neighboring countries \nare  porous,  smuggling  is  rampant,  and  law  enforcement  is  weak.  In \naddition, the province faces the risk of political and regulatory capture by \nthe local elite and subsequent continuation of privileges. Although most of \nthese political risks are beyond the control of a program such as BRMP II, \nthe policy actions aim to set up transparent mechanisms for revenue and \nexpenditure management, and to increase private sector participation. The \nintroduction of more efficient and accountable processes and procedures \nunder BRMP II will reduce the risk of political and regulatory capture. \n \nGovernance,  Corruption,  and  Bureaucratic  Risks.  Transparent  and \naccountable processes and procedures may be resisted for two reasons. \nFirst, the bureaucracy might be unwilling to alter established routines. \nSecond, moving away from a discretionary to a rule-based system will \nlikely  limit  corruption  and  discourage  rent-seeking.  The  resistance  to \nreforms might be stronger in the second case. BRMP II proposes specific \nmeasures that will become part of the legal framework, and will track their \nimplementation.  \n \n \n ", " vi \nCapacity Constraints. Weak capacity in the province is likely to restrict \nthe pace of reform. BRMP II focuses on a limited number of practical \nactions. Advisory and technical support through a TA grant will also be \nprovided to implementing agencies. \n \nFiscal  Sustainability  Risk.  Balochistan  has  limited  fiscal  resources, \ngenerates  little  own-source  revenue,  and  depends  heavily  on  federal \ntransfers, which account for about 93% of its total revenue. At the same \ntime, the GOB has a high overdraft with the central bank. The GOB is \ncommitted to increasing its own-source revenue to 9% of its total revenue \nby  FY2010.  The  pension  reform  and  other  expenditure  management \nmeasures  will  help  manage  contingent  liabilities  and  recurrent \nexpenditures better. \n   \nTechnical  A  TA  grant  for  the  equivalent  of  $800,000  will  support  the  effective \nAssistance  implementation of BRMP II. It will focus on (i) improving fiscal and financial \nGrant  management;  (ii)  building  capacity  in  contract  management  and \nenvironmental  safeguards  within  the  Mines  and  Minerals  Department; \n(iii) strengthening governance, investment structures, and record-keeping \nin the pension system; and (iv) strengthening service delivery in health \nand education. \n \n \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram  cluster  to  the Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Second  Balochistan  Resource \nManagement Program (BRMP II), comprising two subprograms; and (ii) proposed loans for \nsubprogram 1 of BRMP II.1 The report also describes a technical assistance (TA) grant for \nSupporting the Second Balochistan Resource Management Program. If the Board of Directors \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approves the proposed program cluster and the loans, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n2.  Between  FY2004  and  FY2007,  Pakistan\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  on \naverage  more  than  7%  per  year.  However,  global  recessionary  trends,  domestic  political \ninstability, and shortfalls in agricultural production have dampened growth prospects. GDP \ngrowth for FY2008 is estimated at 5.8%, more than a percentage point below the earlier target \nof 7.2%. Other indicators point to deteriorating macroeconomic imbalances on various fronts. \nInflation has reached double digits. Weak revenue growth and rising expenditures, because of \nsharp increases in food and fuel prices and interest payments, widened the fiscal deficit to 7.4% \nof GDP in FY2008. The gap between savings and investment has also expanded. With rising \ninternational commodity prices driving up the cost of imports, the trade deficit has also hit record \nlevels. Foreign portfolio and direct investment have declined, and the growth in remittances has \nnot been sufficient to offset these. External imbalances are also being manifested through the \ndepletion  of  foreign  exchange  reserves  at  the  central  bank  and  significant  currency \ndepreciation.2 In order to restore macroeconomic stability, the Government of Pakistan has \nsigned a Letter of Intent on 20 November 2008 seeking a $7.6 billion stand-by arrangement \nfrom the International Monetary Fund, as part of which broad-ranging macroeconomic reforms \nhave been agreed upon. \n \n3.  Balochistan is the largest province in Pakistan in terms of land area, covering 44% of the \ncountry, but is the smallest in terms of population, accounting for about 5% of the national total. \nThe provincial economy has remained largely agricultural, with crops and livestock producing \nmore than 65% of provincial GDP and employing 60%\u201365% of the total labor force. However, \nthe province\u2019s topography and water scarcity constrain agricultural growth. Only a third of the \nland area is productive agricultural and grazing land. Most industry is concentrated in Lasbela, \nand to a lesser extent in Quetta. Industry is rudimentary and only accounts for 10% of provincial \nGDP. Including mining, industry employs only 3.4% of the labor force. \n \n4.  Balochistan has had the weakest economic performance among the four provinces of \nPakistan because of its narrow agricultural and industrial base. Between FY1973 and FY2005, \nthe economy grew at an average annual rate of 4.2%, compared with 4.9% in North-West \nFrontier Province and Sindh, and 5.2% in Punjab. In 2005, annual per capita income was $410, \nonly two-thirds the national level and slightly more than half the level of Punjab and Sindh. \nBalochistan\u2019s  large  landmass  and  small,  scattered  population  have  resulted  in  segmented \noutput and factor markets. Compounding these issues is the adverse security situation, resulting \nin the poor investment climate. Balochistan is rich in natural resources, but most of these are \nlargely untapped. Although Balochistan accounts for more than half of the country\u2019s prospective \n                                                 \n1 The design and monitoring framework for BRMP II is in Appendix 1. \n2 ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for the Accelerating Economic Transformation Program. Manila, presents further \ndetails. ", "2   \nminerals, it contributes only about a fifth of Pakistan\u2019s gross value-added in mining. With 1,100 \nkilometers of coastline, Balochistan also has the potential to be an international trade corridor. \nHowever, some infrastructure, logistics, and security-related obstacles need to be removed \nbefore investors begin to consider investing in the province. \n \n5.  The  ongoing  economic  slowdown  in  Pakistan  will  likely  test  the  resilience  of \nBalochistan\u2019s economy. Structurally, the economy is vulnerable to downturns because of its \nheavy dependence on a constrained agriculture sector with low productivity and the absence of \nan industrial base. Inflation will likely erode incomes, which are already low, and no major \neconomic alternatives are available. The provincial public sector will have to bear much of the \nburden of providing social safety nets, but its fiscal performance has been poor for several \nyears. \n \n6.  BRMP I was approved by ADB in December 2004 and implemented over a period of 28 \nmonths.3  The  program  aimed  to  improve  provincial  finances  through  fiscal  and  financial \nrestructuring, and enhance service delivery. The Government of Balochistan (GOB) has sought \nfurther support to deepen and sustain the revenue management reforms and to undertake \nspecific measures to attract private investments in the minerals sector, one of the very few \navenues for promoting growth in the province. Section III (subsection D) provides further details \non BRMP I.  \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, ISSUES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Sector Description, Issues, and Opportunities \n7.  The public sector plays an essential role in the development of Balochistan. GOB has \ntwo main tasks: (i) providing the public investment and regulatory framework to facilitate private \nsector activity that drives economic growth; and (ii) delivering public goods to address key social \nneeds, such as education and health. However, government inefficiency has hampered this \nnexus,  weakening  the  province\u2019s  economic  and  social  performance.  Figure  1  shows  how \ngovernment inefficiency arises in Balochistan. It has two proximate causes: lack of fiscal space \nand weak institutional capacity. In terms of fiscal space, GOB depends heavily on federal \nGovernment transfers, though having limited control over such transfers. Own-source revenues \nare low because of a narrow revenue base (arising from an underdeveloped private sector) and \npoor revenue administration. Expenditures, inherently high because of the larger cost required \nto  serve  sparsely  populated  and  scattered  communities,  are  constrained  by  poor  budget \nplanning  and  coordination,  inefficient  subsidies,  increasing  pension  payments,  and  lack  of \ninternal controls. As such, expenditures are poorly targeted and prone to leaks. Inefficient \nbusiness processes and large but poorly skilled bureaucracies weaken the institutional capacity \nin the provincial and local governments. \n \n8.  The 2007 public financial management and accountability (PFMA) assessment indicates \nthe urgency of improving fiscal and financial management to address the lack of fiscal space. \nAreas with low ratings include tax assessment and collection, expenditure composition outturns, \ninternal controls and account reconciliation, and weak tracking of resources for service delivery. \nA summary of the PFMA assessment is in Appendix 2. As such, the major areas for policy \nintervention would be  in (i) revenue administration; (ii) expenditure management, including \nbudgeting, internal controls, and pension liabilities management; and (iii) governance in sectors \nwith high growth and revenue potential, such as minerals.  \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2004.

Balochistan\u2019s fiscal performance is weak. After running surpluses in the \nsecond half of the 1990s, followed by narrow fiscal deficits in FY2001 and FY2002, the province \nhas  experienced  widening  fiscal  deficits.  During  FY2003\u2013FY2006,  expenditures  increased \nrapidly, far outpacing revenue growth. This resulted in large budget deficits, which peaked at \nPRs8.5 billion in FY2004 (more than double that in FY2003). Higher development spending and \nincreases in current expenditure transfers to local governments accounted for most of the rise in \nexpenditures. While total expenditure growth has been slower in Balochistan than in other \nprovinces, the ratio of recurrent to development expenditures has continued to remain high in \nBalochistan because the large, sparsely populated province necessitates higher operational \nexpenditures. In FY2007, an across-the-board gain in federal transfers\u2014more than PRs10 \nbillion or 34% more than the federal transfers in previous fiscal year\u2014significantly boosted \nprovincial revenues and created additional fiscal space. This resulted in a sharp contraction of \nthe budget deficit to PRs244 million in FY2007 (from PRs5.7 billion in FY2006), even as local \ngovernment current expenditure transfers and development spending continued to expand. In \nFY2008, the growth in federal transfers tapered off, largely because of declines in straight \ntransfers, but provincial expenditures continued to rise, mainly for debt servicing, transfers to \nlocal governments, general administration expenditures, and development outlays.4 As a result, \nthe budget deficit again widened to PRs3.3 billion. The sector analysis is in Appendix 3. \n \n \nFigure 2: Fiscal Trends in Balochistan\n60.0\n50.0\n40.0\nn 30.0\no\nBilli\ns \nR\nP 20.0\n10.0\n0.0\n1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008\nFiscal Year\n(10.0)\nFiscal Balance Total Revenue Total Expenditures\nSources: Government of Balochistan. 2008.

Weak  own-source  revenue  generation  has  reduced  the  financial \nresources available for public spending. Balochistan\u2019s own-source revenue, while improving in \nrecent years (from 5.5% of total revenues in FY2002 to 6.7% in FY2007), remains the lowest \namong the four provinces of Pakistan. Recent inflows from land-related revenues have largely \ncome from one-off receipts from the sale and long-term lease of public land. Reforms in the \nmotor vehicle tax (MVT) and provincial excise tax on liquor have led to higher collections. One \nof the BRMP I conditions was to limit the property tax exemption for self-occupied property to \n139.35  square  meters  (1,500.00  square  feet).  Despite  an  executive  commitment  to  this \ncondition by the previous coalition government in 2004, the Provincial Assembly increased the \nexemption to 464.52 square meters (5,000.00 square feet) in 2005. Nonetheless, perhaps \nbecause  of  better  property  tax  collection,  revenues  from  property  taxes  did  not  decline \nsignificantly with the higher exemption. Property tax collections were PRs38 million\u2013PRs40 \nmillion in FY2006\u2013FY2008, slightly less than the PRs41 million collected in FY2005. However, \nrevenue administration remains weak, both for tax and nontax sources. \n  \n11.  Weak revenue performance is attributable to several factors. First, procedures give \nrevenue  officers  substantial  discretion,  which  often  encourages  underreporting  and  corrupt \npractices. Stamp duties and property taxes are still not based on proper valuation and annual \nrental  value  tables,  resulting  in  ad  hoc  and  discretionary  valuation  of  properties.  The \nassessment  of  urban  immovable  property  tax,  for  example,  depends  on  the  tax  officer\u2019s \njudgment of the rental value of the property. For the stamp duty, no valuation rule has been \nformally prescribed.5 More important, while attempts to use valuation tables were made in the \n1990s, this was discontinued when a high court in 1996 disallowed the use of the tables. In the \nabsence of a computerized system of record-keeping, it is difficult to assess if MVTs are being \npaid on time, and at the required rates.  \n \n12.  Second, uncoordinated procedures between the Board of Revenue (BOR) and Excise \nand Taxation Department (ETD) have resulted in revenue leaks from capital gains tax on the \ntransfer of property. The BOR registers property transfers without requiring a no-objection \ncertificate from ETD. In the absence of any required documentation from ETD certifying that \ntaxes accruing to it, such as the property tax and capital gains tax, have been paid, properties \nare transferred without payment of these taxes. Unless the seller of the property voluntarily pays \ncapital gains taxes, ETD is unable to track property transfers that are occurring in the province. \n \n13.  Third, the concept of internal audits within the tax collecting departments is nonexistent \nin Balochistan. A mechanism to verify the accuracy of tax assessments and collection, as well to \ndetect fraud, is not in place. Fiduciary arrangements are weak as the assessment and collection \nfunctions are entrusted to the same officer. As a result, opportunities for rent-seeking have been \navailable for years. \n  \n14.  Fourth, collections are not properly reflected in provincial accounts. Reconciliation of \nrevenue  receipts  between  the  Finance  Department  and  revenue  collection  agencies  is \ninfrequent,  and  there  is  no  integrated  database  to  facilitate  this  process.  From  a  policy \nperspective,  the  inability  to  have  complete  information  on  receipts  prevents  the  Finance \nDepartment from making optimal budgeting decisions. \n \n \n                                                 \n5  BOR has indicated a rule-of-thumb equivalent to the 3-year average of sale deeds in nearby similar properties with \nan upward adjustment of up to 13% per year, but this is not formally prescribed and is not uniformly being followed \nby revenue officers. \n ", "6   \nBox 1: Summary of Key Constraints on the Revenue Front \n \nMain Problem: Low own-source revenues \n \nKey Factors to Address: \n(i)  Unbalanced and excessive discretionary power to tax officers \n(ii)  Lack of coordination in tax collection and verification procedures \n(iii)  Weak tax and nontax receipts reconciliation \n(iv)  Absence of tax audits \n \n \n15.  Poor Budgeting Processes. The current budget planning and preparation process is not \nconducive to proper fiscal discipline or allocative efficiency. Budget preparation is mostly an \nincremental  exercise  that  involves  little  consultation  with  stakeholder  departments  regarding \nallocations for recurrent expenditure. Expenditure allocation and past performance are not linked. \nThe negotiations on allocations occur only when line departments submit statements of new \nexpenditure to the Finance Department. Most departments\u2019 capacity for budget preparation is low. \nSystematic coordination among the Finance Department, Planning and Development Department \n(P&DD), and line departments for preparing current and development budgets is missing.  \n  \n16.  With respect to the development budget, the weak fiscal position has compelled the \nP&DD to refrain from starting new projects until ongoing ones, which require development \nfunds, are completed. The development budget for FY2008 is PRs10 billion, equivalent to 19% \nof  total  provincial  expenditures\u2014the  lowest  proportion  allocated  for  development  spending \namong all the provinces. However, in absolute terms, it is the highest ever for Balochistan. \nFunding and quality of spending are two major issues. With just enough revenues to cover \ncurrent expenditures, the development budget depends on debt financing, of which expensive \noverdrafts from the central bank have been increasing since FY2005. No limits or norms for \ndeficit financing are in place, and debt liability management generally has been handled in an \nad hoc manner. Because of P&DD\u2019s weak capacity, the quality of public investments has been \nundermined by poorly planned and ad hoc loading of development schemes.  \n \n17.  The current level of aggregation in the budget prevents effective tracking of expenditures \ndown  to  the  spending  units.  This  allows  substantial  discretion  in  reallocating  funds  within \ndepartments. The resulting misallocation of funds and the bottlenecks in fund flows impede \nefficient delivery of public services. \n \n18.  Subsidies for the operation of electric tube wells remain a major concern in Balochistan. \nThe government of Balochistan (GOB) has refrained from allowing additional subsidized tube \nwells, and has maintained the PRs2 billion nominal cap on the government\u2019s share (about 4.6% \nof the provincial budget). Actual subsidy payments by the Irrigation and Power Department have \nremained below the ceiling. However, tube well owners are likely to be significantly affected by \nthe recent 20% increase in the electricity tariff, and the capping decision is likely to come under \nsevere pressure. A lifting of the cap would mean an increase in this inefficient subsidy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "                                                      7                    \nBox 2: Summary of Key Expenditure Constraints \n \nMain Problem: Poor expenditure allocation and lack of fiscal discipline \n \nKey Factors to Address: \n(i)  Poor coordination between Finance Department and Planning and Development \nDepartment \n(ii)  Poor budget preparation capacities in departments \n(iii)  Weak budget execution \n(iv)  Weak development planning capacity \n(v)  Unfunded development budget \n(vi)  Proportionately low and ineffective development spending \n(vii)  Continuation of inefficient tube well subsidies \n \n \n19.  Lack  of  Internal  Controls  and  Weak  Financial  Management.  Under  the  current \nfinancial management framework, internal controls necessitate verification of budget cover and \npre-audit, as delegated by the Accountant General Office (AGO), by the treasury officers before \npayment.  Payment  vouchers  are  then  forwarded  to  district  accounts  officers  (DAOs)  for \naccounting, with reconciliations taking place after the end of the month. However, only one of \nthe 30 districts in Balochistan has a fully functional DAO office (in Uthal District). Yet, the bulk of \npublic expenditures take place in at the district level. The Finance Department has promoted its \ntreasury officers to a higher grade, and designated them as DAOs. However, they have not \nbeen adequately trained in the accounting and are unfamiliar for the most part with the new \naccounting  model  and  chart  of  accounts.  Instead  of  treasury  officers  or  DAOs  preparing \naccounts  in  the  districts,  vouchers  are  sent  to  the  AGO  or  the  two  Accountant  General \nsuboffices for subsequent classification. This results in delays in the submission of the monthly \naccounts, misclassification, and subsequent problems in reconciling receipts and expenditures. \n \n20.  The GOB does not have full knowledge of its cash balances. Off-system funds, such as \npersonal ledger accounts and assignment accounts, are widely used. Unlike regular budget \nitems, these accounts are not transparent; fund movements are not explained because their \noperations  are  not  classified.  In  addition,  the  existence  of  these  accounts  tends  to  be \noverlooked as they are part of the public accounts and not the provincial consolidated fund. \nThus, they are virtually outside the discipline of the budget.  \n \nBox 3: Summary of Key Constraints on Internal Controls \n \nMain Problem: Lack of transparency in and proper monitoring of public spending \n \nKey Factors to Address: \n(i)  Weak enforcement of control mechanisms for matching budget commitments and \nexpenditure billings at the level of the drawing and disbursing officer and district \naccounts officer (treasury officer)  \n(ii)  District-level accounting is delegated to untrained personnel \n(iii)  Inability to verify monthly expenditure statements \n(iv)  Prevalence of non-transparent off-system funds \n \n \n ", "8   \n2.  Need  to  Improve  the  Management  of  Expenditure  Liabilities  through \nStrengthening the Civil Service Pension System \n21.  Background. The GOB employs about 142,000 civil servants and pays pension benefits \nto about 33,000 retirees and dependants. The GOB provides a multi-pillar old-age protection \nsystem to its civil servants, consisting of a pension scheme and a general provident fund (GPF), \nsimilar to the old-age systems of the federal Government and the other provincial governments. \nCivil servants pay monthly contributions to the GPF, while the GOB pays pensions from its \nprovincial budget. \n \n22.  Growing  Pension  and  Employee  Benefit  Liabilities.  The  Finance  Department \nestimates that pension and GPF payments increased on average fivefold between FY1997 and \nFY2007. The group insurance payout has quadrupled over the same period. For FY2007, the \npayments were estimated at PRs942.78 million for pensions, PRs561.94 million for GPF, and \nPRs99.56 million for group insurance. The estimate of the financial cost of the accrued pension \nand GPF liabilities will require an actuarial valuation.  \n \n23.  The GOB recognizes that its pension and GPF obligations have major implications for \nthe  finances  of  the  province.  In  response  to  the  growing  fiscal  burden,  the  government \nestablished a pension section within the Finance Department. The main tasks of the section are \nto quantify the pension liability of the GOB and to prepare cash-flow projections to support \nbudgetary allocations.  \n \n24.  Gaps  in  Record-Keeping,  Administration,  and  Payment  Systems.  The  AGO  in \nQuetta is responsible for the administration of the pension and GPF schemes.6 The AGO \ndetermines pension and GPF entitlement for civil servants in the entire province. This service \ndoes not currently exist at the district level, requiring retiring employees to travel to Quetta to \nclaim their pension and GPF entitlements.  \n \n25.  The system of record-keeping, and benefit calculation and payments, is still largely \nmanual  and  paper-based.  However,  it  is  gradually  being  automated  under  the  Project  for \nImprovement in Financial Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA),7 using software that registers payroll, \npension, and GPF data needed to determine the eligibility and benefit amounts. The transition \nwas initiated in Quetta, Pishin, and Mastung districts, which are now computerized.8 While the \npayroll data were transferred from an earlier database, the collection of pension and GPF data \nhas been more challenging. Some data required in the pension module are not readily available \nin the paper records. For the GPF, the contributions collected since each employee\u2019s date of \nhire  are  required  to  calculate  the  value  of  the  GPF  account.  However,  many  records  are \nincomplete and require a long follow-up process. \n \n26.  Another vital step in the administrative process occurs when retirement benefits are \nawarded. A claimant currently has to go through a lengthy process of completing the pension \npayment order, which needs to be cleared by the claimant\u2019s department and approved by the \nAGO. Leaks in the system, in the form of \u201cghost\u201d employees and \u201cghost\u201d pensioners, are \nbelieved to be significant. The current centralized system leads to collusion and the failure of \n                                                 \n6  Its functions include (i) government payroll administration, including the registration and record-keeping of the civil \nservants; (ii) pension scheme benefit determination, payment of annuity benefits, and partial commutations; and \n(iii) pension fund record-keeping and payment of lump sum distributions. \n7  PIFRA is a multiyear, multiphase World Bank project designed to automate, standardize, link, and improve all \naspects of financial reporting and analysis related to all agencies of the federal Government. \n8  The AGO has an Accountant General suboffice covering Pishin and Mastung districts. \n ", "                                                      9                    \nchecks and balances. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many pension payments continue after \nthe death of the pensioner, with the pension booklet being passed on over different generations. \n \n27.  Weak Benefit Structure. Certain features of the current pension and GPF schemes \nhave led to inequitable and arbitrary outcomes for employees. For instance, an employee\u2019s final \nmonthly payroll is used as the basis for calculating the pension. This creates an incentive for \nemployees to secure a pay raise or promotion immediately before retirement. In addition, the \nunfunded promises under the pension and GPF schemes are imposing an increasing burden on \nthe GOB budget, as they do in other provinces. Reforms are required to develop an equitable, \naffordable, and sustainable retirement system that accommodates the mobility of the labor \nforce, not only between the public and private sectors but also across provinces. \n \n28.  Overall, the employee benefit system needs to be reviewed. Benefit payments overlap \nwhen a civil servant dies. At the same time, the employees are dissatisfied with the benefits, \nand the GOB is concerned about the growing cost of the programs. \n \nBox 4: Summary of Key Constraints on Pensions and Contingent Liabilities \n \nMain Problem: Unfunded pension and other contingent liabilities \n \nKey Factors to Address: \n(i)  Growing pension liabilities \n(ii)  Gaps in record-keeping and administration \n(iii)  Weak benefit structure \n \n \n3.  Need  to  Improve  the  Government\u2019s  Role  in  Facilitating  Minerals  Sector \nGrowth \n29.  Background. Balochistan\u2019s mineral resources have not been fully tapped. Although \n1,237 mining licenses have been granted in the province, the scale of operations remains small, \nlimiting production volumes. Independent estimates show that the contribution of mining to \nprovincial GDP declined from about 5.0% in 1995 to about 3.5% in 2005. Despite the lack of \ninfrastructure, poor security conditions, and water and power shortages, interest in the minerals \nsector has increased in recent years. However, the GOB is not ready to maximize the benefits \nfrom the possible influx of mineral investments as it suffers from governance problems and \nlacks sufficient capacity to provide geological data, contract management, and environmental \nsafeguards design and enforcement. As a consequence, the role of the government as a \nfacilitator of sustainable growth in the minerals sector is hampered. \n \n30.  Weak Environmental Safeguards for Extractive Industries. Balochistan does not \nhave any provincial statutes on environmental protection for extractive industries, although there \nis  a  Balochistan  Environment  Protection  Agency  under  the  Environment  and  Sports \nDepartment. The Balochistan Mineral Rules, 2002, require that holders of mineral titles or \nconcessions to take measures to prevent environmental damage and compensate for any \ndamage caused.9 However, the Mines and Minerals Department (MMD) does not have the \ncapacity to design environmental safeguards, much less enforce them. \n \n                                                 \n9  Government of Balochistan. 2002. Balochistan Mineral Rules. Quetta. \n ", "10   \n31.  Suboptimal  Mineral  Agreements.  Because  of  its  poor  capacity  to  evaluate  and \nnegotiate complex agreements, the GOB has not been able to reach its optimal development or \nrevenue potential. Training and expertise is required in the following areas: legal, technical, \nfinancial,  information  technology,  environmental  and  social  safeguards,  and  exposure  to \ninternational best practice. \n \n32.  For mining operations to thrive, the benefits that accrue to the local community need to \nbe  emphasized.  This  requires  well-designed  contractual  arrangements  that  result  in  a \ncoordinated community development plan endorsed by the local community, the government, \nand the mine operator. In Balochistan, royalties paid to the GOB do not revert to the affected \ndistricts, even when agreements specify that they should. In addition, under arrangements \nwhere local governments are relied upon to deliver the services, local governments lack the \ncapacity to do so.  \n \n33.  Poor Implementation in the Assignment of Mining Claims. Weak sector governance \nhas led to the proliferation of idle mining claims. Nonproductive or idle claims throughout the \nmineral survey areas in the province hinder competition and sustainable development. Although \nvirtually all potential mineral deposits have been claimed (i.e., licensed out), less than 40% of \nthe areas are being actively prospected or explored. These idle claims are serving as \u201cland \nbanks\u201d rather than as a foundation for mineral exploration and extraction. The Balochistan \nMineral Rules provide the procedures for assigning mining claims. Anecdotal evidence suggests \nthat the implementation of these rules in allocating mining claims has been subject to political \ninterference, and prone to corruption. Measures are needed to increase transparency, instill the \nrule of law, and eliminate arbitrary selection in the assignment of claims. \n \nBox 5: Summary of Key Constraints on the Minerals Sector \n \nMain Problem: Weak governance in the minerals sector \n \nKey Factors to Address: \n(i)  Weak environmental safeguards for extractive industries \n(ii)  Lack of government capacity in the design and negotiation of mineral agreements  \n(iii)  Poor implementation in the assignment of mining claims \n \n \nB.  Government Strategy \n34.  Economic policies in Balochistan are guided by the white paper of the annual budget. \nThe white paper for the FY2009 budget outlines the overall strategy for the newly elected \ngovernment in Balochistan.10 The immediate priority is to improve the financial health of the \nprovincial government  without compromising development objectives. Recognizing its weak \nown-source revenues in the short term, the GOB will strive to obtain the province\u2019s share of \nfederal Government transfers. The GOB also will aim to manage expenditures prudently by \nlimiting waste in current expenditures and rationalizing development expenditures. \n \n35.  Balochistan has not adopted a new or updated medium-term economic framework to \ncreate an overarching vision for the economy since the Balochistan poverty reduction strategy \npaper  (PRSP)  was  approved  in  2004.11  The  PFMA  assessment  (para.  8)  identifies  key \n                                                 \n10  Government of Balochistan. 2008.

More important, the assessment can be used as a \nguidepost and starting point for setting the governance reform agenda over the medium term. \nThe government\u2019s annual budget exercise recognizes the weaknesses identified by the PFMA \nassessment. However, in the absence of a medium-term strategy, the risk of having incoherent \nactions is high. This provides the opportunity for a new program, such as BRMP II, to help the \nGOB develop a new economic framework to map out actions over the medium term.  \n \nC.  ADB Operations and Lessons \n36.  To support decentralization, public resource management, and social service delivery, \nADB  has  implemented  three  programs  in  Balochistan  since  2002:  (i)  the  Decentralization \nSupport  Program,  (ii)  BRMP  I,  and  (iii)  Balochistan  Devolved  Social  Services  Program \n(BDSSP).  The  Decentralization  Support  Program  (2002\u20132008)  was  a  federal  Government \nprogram  with  province-based  components  to  improve  local  government  representation, \naccountability,  and  efficiency,  resulting  in  better  service  delivery  through  fiscal  support  for \nreforms in policy, legal, technical, and fiscal domains.12 BRMP I (2005\u20132007) aimed to improve \npublic resource management, and help the GOB create fiscal space to finance high-priority \nsocial and human development programs by local governments.13 BDSSP (continuing until \n2009) supports policy reforms to improve education, health, and access to water supply and \nsanitation.14 It also provides financing for performance grants to the districts to improve the \ndelivery of social services. \n \n37.  A Longer-Term Strategic Framework. One of the key issues raised by the country \nassessment program evaluation (CAPE) is that the concept of a longer-term road map, or at \nleast plausible alternatives, is needed for successful policy-based lending.15 The CAPE finds \nthat  the  public  resource  management  and  devolved  social  services  programs  were  being \nreplicated across Pakistan without a clear longer-term strategic direction. That is now being \naddressed with a clear focus on improving government efficiency and service delivery.  \n \n38.  Securing Ownership of Reforms. All reforms, particularly policy and institutional ones, \nmust have full political and bureaucratic ownership within the government, as these frequently \ninvolve changes in the status quo. This necessitates adequate internal dialogue between the \nbureaucracy and the political leadership before the commitments are made. BRMP I appeared \nto suffer from this disconnect, as the bureaucratic-level commitments at times were inconsistent \nwith the political understanding of as well as commitment for reforms. \n \n39.  Building  Flexibility  Within  Programs.  Policy  reforms  are  inherently  complex  and \nrequire  flexibility  to  respond  to  the  changing  social,  economic,  and  political  environment. \nExperiences from the public resource management and devolved social services programs in \nPakistan  suggest  that  multitranche  programs  faced  significant  difficulties  in  implementing \nreforms. Consequently, tranche releases are delayed because the policy conditions are no \nlonger in sync with changing realities. As such, single-tranche cluster programs, with policy \nactions  completed  before  program  approval,  combined  with  indicative  policy  actions  for \nsubsequent subprograms will provide the flexibility for ADB and the GOB to design sequential \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2002.

Strengthening  Coordination  among  Implementing  Agencies.  The  BRMP  I \nexperience  demonstrates  the  need  for  and  importance  of  close  coordination  among  the \nimplementing agencies. It is vital to provide incentives to selected focal persons in the key \nimplementing agencies. Further, proper dissemination of the reform achievements and benefits \nhelps build constituencies of support, an element that should receive more attention in any \nfuture reform engagements.  \n \n41.  Mode of TA Support Is Critical. The CAPE noted that Pakistan is a challenging context \nin which to implement a development program. Specifically, the disbursement of TA loans has \nbeen problematic. As the CAPE indicates, the lack of ownership by executing agencies is an \napparent reason for this. Under BRMP I, like in the case of other programs, the implementation \nof the TA loan was slow, with poor utilization. Constraints were faced in consultant recruitment \nas  well  as  integrating  TA  activities  towards  the  achievement  of  program  objectives. \nConsequently, TA grants may be more effective in providing TA support to Balochistan, as ADB \nis more directly involved with their implementation.  \n \nD.  BRMP I: Key Achievements and Issues \n42.  BRMP  I  was  envisaged  to  improve  provincial  finances  through  fiscal  and  financial \nrestructuring, and enhance public and private service delivery. These outcome were to be \nachieved  in  seven  policy  reform  areas:  (i)  rationalizing  subsidies,  (ii)  enhancing  revenues, \n(iii) improving financial management systems, (iv) establishing a rules-based system for local \ngovernment  funding,  (v)  improving  administrative  frameworks  for  public  service  delivery, \n(vi) creating an enabling environment for private sector development and promoting public\u2013\nprivate partnerships in service delivery, and (vii) improving water resource management.  \n \n43.  The key actions undertaken included the following: \n  \n(i)  capping the open-ended electric tube well subsidy in nominal terms and in terms \nof the number of tube wells eligible for subsidy, thereby preventing the crowding \nout of more productive expenditures;  \n(ii)  openly auctioning royalty collection rights on mines and minerals, which led to \nsubstantial improvements in the province\u2019s own-source revenue;  \n(iii)  increasing the MVT;  \n(iv)  reducing the throw forward of development schemes, excluding mega projects, \nfrom 10 years to 4 years;17  \n(v)  promulgating the local government performance grant rules;  \n(vi)  developing a public grievance redress mechanism;  \n(vii)  enhancing the financial and administrative autonomy of the Balochistan Public \nService Commission; and  \n(viii)  approving an integrated water resource management policy. \n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2007.

It provides information on \nhow many years it will take to complete a development scheme, or in how many future budgets the scheme will \nhave to appear. \n ", "                                                    1  3                    \n44.  The ambitious and broad scope of BRMP I, combined with the weak capacity in the \nprovince, resulted in nine tranche conditions not being fully achieved before its closure. In \naddition, the complexity of BRMP I was considerably higher due to a large number of nested \nconditions. The second tranche release report for BRMP I stated that nine conditions, which had \nnot been fully complied with, should be revisited as conditions for processing of BRMP II.18 The \ngenerally  satisfactory  progress  made  under  the  pending  conditions  is  summarized  in \nAppendix 4. \n \nE.  External Assistance \n45.  Support  from  other  development  partners  for  fiscal  and  financial  management  in \nBalochistan has been limited and sector specific. World Bank is implementing PIFRA II, an $84 \nmillion project to improve financial reporting and systems in all provinces, including that of the \npension system. World Bank, with support from the Department for International Development \nof the United Kingdom, is preparing a fiscal decentralization program. The United Nations \nDevelopment Programme, through its National Execution Project, is (i) strengthening provincial \nand  local  government  institutions;  (ii)  ensuring  access  to  information  for  effective  decision \nmaking, planning, and monitoring in provincial and local governments; and (iii) strengthening \nmechanisms for participatory local governance. The United States Agency for International \nDevelopment (USAID) is helping build capacity in the provincial assembly, while its Districts \nThat Work project is operating in Lasbela. The Canadian International Development Agency, \nthrough the Supporting Democratic Governance Project, is creating an enabling environment for \ndemocratic governance and citizens\u2019 participation in 40 districts in Pakistan, 10 of which are in \nBalochistan. \n \n46.  In the minerals sector, World Bank is mobilizing its Mineral Technical Assistance Project \nto assist the Government of Pakistan and GOB in developing a minerals geological database, \nimproving regulatory framework, and building capacity. \n \n47.  In terms of development partner coordination, the new program will have to closely \ncoordinate with PIFRA II and Mineral Technical Assistance Project. Regular dialogue with other \nprojects will be conducted at the project and development partner level, and within the GOB and \nthe Government of Pakistan. The development coordination matrix is in Appendix 5. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n48.  The  long-term  impact  of  BRMP  II  is  higher  and  sustained  economic  growth.  The \noutcome of BRMP II will be improved public resource management, characterized by higher \nown-source  revenues  and  more  efficient  resource  allocation  and  utilization.  Better  public \nresource management also entails improving governance in key sectors in Balochistan, such as \nminerals.  This  will  allow  sustainable  development,  which  generates  more  fiscal  resources, \ncreates jobs, raises incomes, and reduces poverty. This is to be achieved through reforms that \nwill  expand  the  resource  envelope,  raise  fiduciary  controls  and  safeguards,  improve  fiscal \nplanning  and  coordination,  and  improve  governance  and  environmental  safeguards  in  the \nminerals sector.  \n \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2007.

BRMP II is a cluster program with two subprograms. The Program will have three core \npolicy areas (CPAs): (i) improve public financial management, (ii) develop an affordable and \nsustainable pension and employee benefit system, and (iii) enhance the government\u2019s role as a \nfacilitator of minerals sector growth. Subprogram 1 aims to provide the foundational reforms for \nbetter public resource management by addressing legal and institutional hurdles to revenue \nmobilization,  improving  budgeting  procedures,  and  strengthening  financial  control  and \ngovernance mechanisms. Subprogram 2 will aim to deepen the fiscal, financial management, \npension, and minerals sector reforms. The development policy letter and policy matrix are in \nAppendix 6.19 \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n1.  CPA 1: Improve Public Financial Management \na.  Enhance Own-Source Revenue by Improving Provincial Tax \nAdministration \n50.  Increasing own-source revenue in Balochistan is challenging given that incomes are \ngenerally low. Parametric tax reforms may impose an additional burden on the population and \nmay only add to political instability in the province.20 Instead, the proposed program will focus \non tax administration reforms that reduce the discretion of the collecting agents and improve \ninformation systems. Tax administration reforms will cover four taxes: stamp duty on property \ntransfers, urban immovable property tax, MVT, and capital gains tax on property transfers. \nUnder  subprogram  1,  the  GOB  has  agreed  to  submit  to  the  Provincial  Assembly  a  draft \namendment to the Stamp Act to allow the use of stamp duty valuation tables. This will remove \nthe  legal  hurdles  that  have  prevented  the  use  of  such  tables.  Under  subprogram  2,  the \ngovernment will implement the use of the stamp duty valuation tables in the entire province. \n \n51.  Under subprogram 1, the GOB has agreed to submit to the Provincial Assembly a draft \namendment to the urban immovable property tax law, allowing the use of annual rental value \ntables in the assessment of this tax. In subprogram 2, the ETD will implement the annual rental \nvalue tables for Quetta, and will further develop and implement annual rental value tables in four \nmajor other urban areas outside Quetta.  \n \n52.  BRMP II will support the implementation of an online payment for MVT. The ETD has \ninitiated the development of a computerized database of registered vehicles for the MVT; and \nunder subprogram 1, it has completed data entry for the 11 offices of the ETD. This will allow \nthe ETD to maintain a record of registrations and annual tax payments. The ETD has also \nagreed to finalize a time-bound action plan on the implementation of online payment of MVT. In \nsubprogram 2, the online payment will be rolled out in areas covered by the 11 offices. \n \n53.  To ensure that property transfers are taxed, the ETD and BOR will improve coordination \nto properly account for capital gains taxes on property transfers. Procedures will be revised to \nrequire a no-objection certificate from the ETD, certifying that the capital gains tax has been \npaid, before the transfer of property ownership is registered by the BOR. \n \n                                                 \n19 During the processing of subprogram 1, the mission and GOB had extensive discussions on social service delivery, \nDepending on the outcomes of BDSSP, the scope of subprogram 2 may be expanded to cover reforms that will \nfurther strengthen social service delivery. Appendix 7 summarizes issues and possible future reform areas for \nsocial service delivery. \n20 Parametric tax reforms refer to changes in the tax structure, including tax rates. \n ", "                                                    1  5                    \n54.  Under subprogram 2, a tax audit system will need to be developed, which will result in \nthe restructuring of the ETD along the lines of assessment, collection, and audit. The GOB will \nalso introduce taxpayer facilitation education programs to encourage tax payments. This ranges \nfrom establishing tax assessment kiosks in key locations to  more transparent assessment \nnotices.  \n \nb.  Strengthen Revenue Management Through Better Revenue \nPlanning, Reporting, and Monitoring \n \n55.  Institutional reforms within the Finance Department are required to strengthen revenue \nmobilization. Currently, the Finance Department lacks the technical capacity to support the \nformulation of revenue policy, undertake revenue monitoring and reconciliation, and forecast \nrevenue. This has limited its role to receiving the collected revenues. Under BRMP II, the \nFinance Department is envisaged to be the lead department that will formulate the directions for \nrevenue  policy,  as  well  as  coordinate,  monitor,  and  assess  the  performance  of  revenue-\ngenerating departments. This necessitates the establishment of a unit dedicated to revenue \nmanagement that has adequate technical capacity and revenue information systems. Under \nsubprogram 1, to strengthen the province\u2019s capacity for  monitoring revenues and revenue \nplanning, the Finance Department has established a revenue unit whose principal functions are \nformulating  revenue  policy  and  planning,  setting  revenue  targets,  projecting  revenue,  and \nmonitoring and reconciling revenue receipts. The unit will assist BOR, ETD, and other revenue-\ngenerating agencies on tax and revenue policy and management. It will build capacity by \nhelping determine tax rates, fees, and user charges; and updating tax and revenue policy. In \nsubprogram 2, the unit will work on the development of a revenue management system for \nmonitoring revenue receipts from both own-source revenues and federal transfers. Revenue \nreconciliation will be done monthly. \n \nc.  Achieve Effective Budgets Through Better Budget Planning and \nCoordination, and More Fiscal Discipline \n \n56.  The Finance Department and P&DD need to work together to better coordinate budget \ndevelopment and utilization. Formalized arrangements, such as joint protocols, would be one \ninstrument  that  would  allow  for  better  synchronization  with  an  agreed  upon  schedule  of \ndevelopment  expenditures.  The  GOB  has  agreed  to  adopt  joint  budget  protocols  for \ncoordinating the preparation of current and development budgets under subprogram 1. These \nwill result in clearer expenditure ceilings across line departments. Sustainability of development \nprojects  also  will  be  boosted  with  the  allocation  of  resources  for  recurrent  operation  and \nmaintenance  needs.  To  improve  expenditure  allocation,  the  Finance  Department  has \ndisaggregated the budget down to the level of the drawing and disbursing officers. To guide \nbudget planning and policy, the Finance Department will institutionalize the preparation of rolling \nmedium-term revenue and expenditure projections in subprogram 2. The GOB will also adopt a \nfiscal  responsibility  framework  in  subprogram  2  to  instill  fiscal  discipline,  particularly  in \nexpenditure management. \n \n57.  The PFC needs to have complete information on the staff complement in each district \ngovernment when deciding the magnitude of transfers to each one. Under subprogram 1, the \nFinance Department has agreed to approve a detailed schedule of establishment for district \ngovernments. 21 In subprogram 2, the next 3-year PFC, which is expected to be approved by \n                                                 \n21 The schedule of establishment is the staff strength (complement) sanctioned for each government unit. \n ", "16   \nJune 2009, will use the detailed schedule of establishment to determine allocations. This is \nenvisaged to improve the precision of the allocation of the PFC awards to district governments. \n \n58.  While the removal of the tube well subsidy is the best solution, the political cost of such a \nmove is substantial. With electricity prices rising, continuing the cap on the subsidy and the \nfreeze on subsidized electric tube wells will prevent the subsidy from increasing and crowding \nout other expenditures. BRMP II will ensure that the PRs2 billion cap on electric tube well \nsubsidies and the freeze on the number of subsidized electric tube wells at 15,660 remain in \neffect.  \n \n59.  Under the program, the link between the development budget and poverty and economic \nstrategies will be strengthened. Under subprogram 2, the provincial government will adopt the \nsecond Balochistan poverty reduction strategy paper as a medium-term economic development \nstrategy. Subsequently, the PSDP will have to be aligned with that strategy paper. \n \nd.  Improve Budget Execution by Strengthening Financial Management \nand Disclosure \n \n60.  The Finance Department, in consultation with the AGO, will facilitate better accounting \nand reconciliation of accounts in Balochistan. Under PIFRA, civil works to upgrade facilities in \n11 treasury offices and bring them up to the level required for DAO offices are expected to be \ncompleted by 31 December 2008. BRMP II complements these PIFRA activities by ensuring \nthat the GOB provides appropriately trained personnel to staff the upgraded facilities. This \nwould help in the reconciliation and accounting of receipts and expenditures. \n \n61.  Under  BRMP  II,  the  Finance  Department  will  lead  the  reconciliation  of  expenditure \naccounts for the provincial government. Expenditures have been reconciled for FY2008 in \nsubprogram  1.  The  monthly  reconciliation  of  expenditures  will  start  in  subprogram  2,  and \nmonthly reconciliation reports with be posted on the GOB website. \n \n62.  To increase the transparency and tracking of off-system funds, the GOB will have to \nenforce stringent budgetary discipline in the management and accounting of off-system funds. \nUnder subprogram 1, the Finance Department has converted the personal ledger accounts to \nlapsable special drawing accounts that are subject to regular budget, reporting, and audit rules. \nAll assignment accounts will also be subject to regular budget, reporting, and reconciliation \nrules. More transparency and accountability will be supported in subprogram 2 with the public \ndisclosure  of  financial  statements  of  autonomous  government  entities  and  corporations  by \nincluding them in the budget documents, and through external audits of local governments. \n \n63.  Public  financial  management  can  be  strengthened  with  better  expenditure  tracking. \nUnder BDSSP, a public expenditure tracking survey to monitor the efficiency of social sector \nexpenditures was initiated. This was to be piloted in two districts. Under subprogram 2, a review \nof the respective pilot districts will be conducted. Based on the review, the survey will be refined \nand expanded to at least five districts. \n \n ", "                                                    1  7                    \n2.  CPA 2: Develop an Affordable and Sustainable Pension and Employee \nBenefit system \na.  Establish Pension and General Provident Investment Funds Based \non Sound Fiduciary Governance \n64.  BRMP II will enable the GOB to better manage the growing burden of the pension and \nGPF  benefit  payments,  and  to  generate  fiscal  space  for  future  priority  development \nexpenditures. It will assist in the establishment of well-managed pension and general provident \ninvestment  funds  based  on  good  fiduciary  governance  to  meet  the  expanding  pension \nobligations.  In  2007,  the  government  passed  the  Balochistan  Pension  Fund  Management \nAuthority  Ordinance  and  the  Provincial  Employees  General  Provident  Investment  Fund \nOrdinance. \n \n65.  The Finance Department has prepared a time-bound action plan under subprogram 1 \nspecifying the steps to establish the pension and general provident investment funds with a \nsound  governance  structure,  supported  by  a  diversified  investment  policy  and  a  plan  to \nimplement the investment management functions. At the same time, an actuarial valuation has \nbeen undertaken to estimate the pension and GPF liabilities, and provide cash flow projections \nfor the next 20 years. Based on the results of the actuarial assessment, the GOB will be in a \nposition to determine how to finance the pension and GPF liabilities. \n \n66.  Under subprogram 2, the Finance Department will establish the pension and general \nprovident  investment  funds  based  on  a  strategy  that  links  the  following  three  issues: \n(i) protecting  the  investment  process  through  the  structure  of  the  board,  (ii)  creating  an \ninvestment policy that meets the needs of an acceptable level of risk against investment return \ngoals, and (iii) establishing the structure of the investment unit to manage in this environment. \nKey actions in this regard include the creation of the investment unit, responsible for the day-to-\nday operations of the funds, and the identification of functions that need to be outsourced to \nservice  contractors  (custodian,  actuary,  legal  advisor,  and  independent  auditor).  With  the \ncreation of the pension and general provident investment funds, the relevant legislation will \nneed to be revised. Implementing rules and regulations will need to be prepared and adopted. \nThe first substantial budget transfer to the pension and general provident investment funds will \ntake place once a sound governance structure, investment policy, and investment structure are \nin place, currently envisaged for FY2010. \n \nb.  Improve Record-Keeping, Administration, and Pension Payment \n67.  BRMP  II  calls  for  accurate  information  on  contributions  levied  and  accrued  GPF \nentitlements to the civil servants as well as timely issuance timely of correct pension and GPF \npayments to pensioners. A reliable record-keeping system in the AGO is required, as well as an \nautomated process to calculate benefits and a secure pension payment process. \n \n68.  A  data  conversion  administration  task  force,  comprising  representatives  from  the \nFinance Department and AGO, has been created under subprogram 1 to coordinate the data \ngathering and conversion tasks, the expansion of pension scheme- and GPF-related services in \ndistricts, and the verification of the accuracy of the data. Under this arrangement, the Finance \nDepartment  ensures  compliance  and  monitors  advancement  of  the  data  collection  and \nverification. During subprogram 2, the task force will prepare an action plan to expand the \npension and GPF services in districts, and will initiate implementation.  \n \n ", "18   \n69.  Only the provincial AGO in Quetta and the Accountant General suboffice in Uthal District \nhave an operational database under PIFRA during implementation of subprogram 1, with a total \nof 41,797 civil servants, 12,033 pensioners, and 2,160 GPF records entered into the system.22 \nAGO and PIFRA are gradually upgrading and computerizing district offices, allowing for a \nfurther expansion of the computerization of the record-keeping. The data gathering, verification, \nand conversion for most payroll, pension, and GPF records will be completed in subprogram 2. \n \nc.  Streamline Pension and Employee Benefit System \n70.  BRMP  II  will  prepare  the  provincial  policy  makers  to  participate  in  the  debate  on \nreforming the pension and employee benefit system. The current pension and employee benefit \nsystem is outdated and needs a comprehensive revision.  \n \n71.  Benefit  payments  overlap  considerably  when  a  civil  servant  dies.  The  GPF,  the \nbenevolent fund, and the group life insurance all pay benefits to the dependents. Streamlining \nthese programs seems advisable. At the same time, the entire employee benefit package can \nbe  revised  to  fit  the  needs  of  the  current  employment  situation.  Under  subprogram  2,  a \ndiagnostic study of the employee benefit package will be prepared, and it will propose different \nalternatives, with their costs prepared by an actuary. The alternatives will be discussed by policy \nmakers and stakeholders. \n \n72.  Pension and the employee benefits are a federal matter. However, the provinces are \namong the major stakeholders, and they are interested in reforming the employee benefit \npackage so it better fits the needs of their civil servants. The creation of the pension and general \nprovident investment funds is a first step, but additional reforms will be needed. All these \nchanges come together with an immediate and future cost. The actuarial valuation of these \ncosts is a key element in the pension debate. The Office of the Chief Actuary in the Ministry of \nFinance is mandated to measure the accrued pension liability of the civil service pension \nsystem, both for the pension and GPF benefits. The creation of an actuarial cell in the Finance \nDepartment under subprogram 2 will allow the department to interact better with the federal \nActuarial  Office  and  to  understand  the  modeling  of  the  pension  and  GPF  reforms  in  the \nprovinces.  \n \n3.  CPA 3: Enhance the Government\u2019s Role as Facilitator of Minerals Sector \nGrowth \na.  Benefits Accruing to the Public Through Better Mineral Agreements \nand Environmental Safeguards \n \n73.  Balochistan has significant potential to increase its revenues substantially by developing \nits minerals sector. In addition to potentially large royalty revenues, private sector involvement in \nmineral development can create jobs, stimulate spin-off industries, and contribute to local social \nand physical infrastructure in mining areas. To develop a mining sector that conveys these \nbenefits,  BRMP  II  will  help  the  GOB  develop  sufficient  capacity  for  contract  evaluation, \nenvironmental safeguard design, and overall good governance of the sector to ensure sustained \neconomic  expansion.  In  addition  to  raising  the  government\u2019s  financial  returns  from  mining \nactivities, sustainable development of the minerals sector needs to be pursued. As investor \ninterest increases, BRMP II will assist the GOB in designing safeguards and contract provisions \nto prevent environmental degradation from mining activities. \n                                                 \n22 The PIFRA database uses the SAP/R3 software. \n ", "                                                    1  9                    \n \n74.  To increase fiduciary care and optimize results from evaluation and contract negotiation, \nthe GOB has agreed to establish a cell within the MMD to handle evaluation, negotiation, and \ncontract management under subprogram 1. The cell will become fully operational and will be \nstrengthened in subprogram 2. The dedicated unit will help build capacity within MMD to enable \nits staff to properly design mineral contracts that will protect the interests of Balochistan. In \naddition,  sufficient  capacity  will  be  developed  to  ensure  that  benefit-sharing  programs, \nappropriate environment and social safeguards, and proper labor standards are included in \nmineral contracts. To improve environmental safeguards for extractive industries and bring them \nin  line  with  best  practices,  BRMP  II,  through  its  TA  grant,  will  help  the  GOB  review \nenvironmental  policies  and  regulations,  and  build  capacity  to  design  and  implement \nenvironmental, health, and safety guidelines. Under subprogram 2, information on all mining \nand  mineral  investments  will  be  consolidated  in  a  manner  sufficient  to  inform  contract \nnegotiations, application evaluation, and sector strategy. \n \nb.  Improve Governance and Transparency in Mineral Revenues and \nMining Claims \n \n75.  BRMP II will help the GOB address key governance and transparency issues in the \nminerals sector. BRMP II will support greater transparency in mineral revenues in line with the \nExtractive  Industries  Transparency  Initiative.  Greater  financial  transparency  enhances  the \nenvironment for domestic and foreign direct investment, which can be beneficial to Balochistan. \nUnder  subprogram  1,  the  GOB  has  agreed  to  approve  a  policy  statement  toward  greater \ndisclosure of government revenues and company payments from the minerals sector. It has \nalso agreed to publish mineral royalties received from mineral title and concession holders. A \ntime-bound action plan towards achieving better monitoring and greater disclosure in line with \nthe  Extractive  Industries  Transparency  Initiative  will  be  completed  and  implemented  in \nsubprogram 2. \n \n76.  As part of subprogram 1, the GOB has agreed to enhance the transparency in allocation \nof mining claims by the publication of the information about all existing claims on the GOB \nwebsite. Under subprogram 2, comprehensive analytical work will be conducted to assess the \nstatus of each mining claim, identify which can be classified as idle or unproductive, and \nrecommend  measures  to  rationalize  such  claims.  The  study  will  recommend  measures  to \nstrengthen  the  business  process  in  the  assignment  of  mining  claims  to  reduce  political \ninterference  and  corrupt  practices.  This  is  expected  to  lead  to  the  development  and \nimplementation of a comprehensive strategy by the GOB to rationalize idle mining claims.  \n \nC.  Important Features \n77.  A Narrower and Focused Set of Actions to Improve Resource Management. In light \nof the capacity and implementation constraints in Balochistan, BRMP II is simpler. The actions \nproposed are realistic with far less scope for delays or reversals. A two-pronged approach is \nadopted on financing and coordination. First, because of the GOB\u2019s chronic lack of sufficient \nfinancial resources, BRMP II will help increase resources by improving efficiency in revenue \ngeneration, enhancing revenue monitoring and reporting, and institutionalizing revenue planning. \nFurther, additional resources are to be generated with better governance in the minerals sector. \nSecond, as more resources are generated, BRMP II aims to strengthen agency coordination, \nexpenditure  controls,  and  fiduciary  mechanisms  to  ensure  that  these  resources  are  utilized \nefficiently. In addition, more fiscal space is expected in the future as pension payments are made \n ", "20   \noff-budget and funded from a viable investment fund. The adoption of a fiscal responsibility \nframework in subprogram 2 will strengthen fiscal discipline. \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n78.  Loan Size, Terms, and Conditions. The proposed program cluster, consisting of two \nsubprograms, will have an indicative total loan amount of $200 million. The Government of \nPakistan has requested two loans equivalent to $100 million to help finance subprogram 1 of \nBRMP II. The first loan of $45 million will be financed from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nwith interest to be determined according to ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility; a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; and other terms and \nconditions substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft program loan agreement \npresented to the Board. The second loan of $55 million equivalent will be financed from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources, with an annual interest rate of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% \nthereafter; a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as  set  forth  in  the  draft  program  loan  agreement  presented  to  the  Board.  The \nGovernment of Pakistan has decided on its own to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility and Special Funds resources, and it has made an undertaking to the effect that this \nchoice  was  not  made  on  the  basis  of  any  advice  from  ADB.  Interest  rate  and  currency \nconversion options may be exercised according to the terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement, the loan regulations, and ADB\u2019s conversion guidelines. The Government of \nPakistan will relend the local currency generated from the proceeds of the loan to the GOB \nunder  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  those  extended  by  ADB  to  the  Government  of \nPakistan. The Government of Pakistan will assume the foreign exchange risk. \n \n79.  The following factors have been taken into account in determining the loan size: (i) the \nstrength  of  the  Program  and  its  development  impact,  (ii)  the  financial  and  political  cost \nassociated with the implementation of the Program, and (iii) the overall development financing \nneeds estimated by the Finance Department of the GOB. \n \n80.  The principal reason for the GOB\u2019s decision to seek ADB\u2019s policy reform and financing \nsupport is to begin partial funding of the civil service pension and general provident investment \nfunds. It intends to use the fiscal space created by the $45 million loan funded from ordinary \ncapital resources, to capitalize the civil service pension and general provident investment funds. \nCounterpart funds generated from proceeds of the Special Funds resources loan in the amount \nof  $55  million  equivalent  will  be  used  (i)  to  supplement  development  spending in  districts \nthrough a performance grant system, (ii) to capitalize the civil service pension and general \nprovident investment funds, and (iii) for program implementation. \n \n81.  Reforms under BRMP II are expected to improve resource mobilization by generating \nmore revenues and improving public expenditure management, which in turn will translate into \ngood governance, greater fiscal space, reduction in waste and inefficiencies, and improvement in \npublic service delivery. Given Balochistan\u2019s weak capacity, reforms under BRMP II are vital to \nspur and sustain development in the province. As such, the opportunity cost of not undertaking \nreforms will be high. Because of their scope, the financial and economic costs associated with the \nreforms are expected to be substantial. Political costs are also considerable as the reforms, such \nas those to improve regulation of the minerals sector, plug revenue leaks, and strengthen fiduciary \ncontrols,  will  have  to  counter  vested  interests  that  benefit  from  weak  governance.  Direct \nadjustment costs include (i) capitalization of pension and general provident investment funds, \n(ii) implementation to improve revenue generation and strengthen public financial management \nsystems, (iii) modernization of the public sector institutions involved in regulating the minerals \n ", "                                                    2  1                    \nsector, and (iv) leveraging of reforms that may face resistance through consensus building. While \nthe reforms will have costs in the short run, the eventual economic benefits will greatly outweigh \nthe costs in the long run. \n \n82.  For the current fiscal year, the GOB\u2019s financing needs are substantial (Table 1).23 The \nbudget deficit is expected to reach PRs11.7 billion (about $143.9 million). Identified financing, from \nexternal and internal sources, is PRs5.9 billion (about $72.7 million). This means nearly half of the \ngovernment\u2019s financing needs\u2014PRs5.8 billion (about $71.2 million)\u2014are unfunded. The plan of \nthe GOB to substantially capitalize the pension and general provident investment funds increases \nthe unfunded gap to PRs11.3 billion (about $138.5 million). \n \nTable 1: Funding Requirement for FY2009 \n Item  PRs Million  $ Million \nTotal Revenues  51,526.75  631.28  \nTotal Expenditures  63,267.05  775.24  \nBudget Surplus or Deficit  (11,740.30)  (143.86) \nTotal Available Financing  5,934.14  72.71  \nFunding Gap  5,806.16  71.15  \nAdd: Pension and general provident Investment Funds \nCapitalizationa  5,500.00  67.39  \nTotal Funding Gap with Pension and  \nGeneral Provident Funds  11,306.16  138.54  \n( ) = negative. \na  Finance Department estimates. \nNote: Exchange rate used is PRs81.61:$1 (exchange rate as of 29 October 2008). \nSource: Government of Balochistan. 2008.

The implementing \nagencies for subprogram 1 will be the BOR, ETD, MMD, Finance Department and P&DD. A \nhigh-level steering committee will be chaired by the chief secretary and comprise as members \nadditional chief secretary (development), finance secretary, senior member BOR, secretary of \nETD, and secretary of MMD. The finance secretary will serve as secretary-member of the \ncommittee. The steering committee is envisaged to (i) increase government ownership of the \nprogram, (ii) facilitate better program implementation, and (iii) provide program oversight to \nachieve the reforms envisaged under BRMP II. It will convene at least once a quarter and post \nits major decisions and recommendations on the BRMP website.  \n \n84.  A dedicated program coordination unit (PCU) will be established within the Finance \nDepartment; it will be headed by a senior officer with the rank of at least an additional secretary. \nThe PCU will coordinate and monitor the day-to-day implementation of the reform agenda of \nBRMP II. The head of the PCU will report directly to the finance secretary. Each implementing \nagency will appoint a focal person to coordinate with the head of the PCU in achieving the \nreform agenda under BRMP II. The progress of reforms under BRMP II will be shared with ADB \nquarterly. The program management structure is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n                                                 \n23 A more detailed table is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n ", "22   \n  2.  Implementation Period \n \n85.  The reforms supported under BRMP II subprogram1 cover November 2007 to December \n2008. The loan closing date for subprogram 1 is 30 June 2009. The indicative implementation \nperiod for subprogram 2 is from January 2009 to June 2010. Loan completion is expected by 30 \nJune 2010, and the loan closing date is 31 December 2010. \n \n86.  To ensure flexibility and still guide reforms, a detailed action plan for subprogram 1 has \nbeen developed in consultation with the GOB. The action plan is a living document, adjusted \nthrough close coordination between ADB and the GOB to assist with policy reforms. While \nreform measures are closely linked and not discrete, the actions supported under BRMP I and II \ndo not overlap. \n \n  3.  Tranches and Counterpart Financing \n \n87.  The loans must have become effective, all prior actions in the subprogram 1 policy \nmatrix  in  Appendix  6  must  have  been  satisfied  before  the  subprogram  1  tranche  can  be \nwithdrawn. \n \n88.  Counterpart Funds. The GOB will ensure that the local currency counterpart funds \ngenerated by the loans will be used to support essential reform requirements as well as to \nfinance  general  development  expenditures.  Specifically,  funds  generated  from  the  ordinary \ncapital resources loan as well as the Asian Development Fund loan will be used to capitalize the \npension and general provident investment funds. A part of the resources generated from the \nAsian Development Fund loan will be used to supplement development spending in districts \nthrough the performance grant system and program implementation. The GOB will certify the \nuse  of  counterpart  funds  in  line  with  the  Loan  Agreement  through  audited  statements \nacceptable to ADB.  \n \n4.  Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements  \n \n89.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding \nlocal duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding \nineligible items (Appendix 8) and imports24 financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  program  loans  will  be  disbursed  to  Pakistan  as  the  Borrower,  in \naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and \nRelated  Requirements  for  Program  Loans.25  No  supporting  import  documentation  will  be \nrequired if, during each year that the loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of \nPakistan\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and \nimports financed under other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the \namount of the loan expected to be disbursed during that year. The Government of Pakistan will \ncertify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import \ndocumentation under existing procedures will be required.  \n \n \n                                                 \n24  Eligible imports are total imports minus imports from nonmember countries, imports specified on the list of ineligible \nitems, and imports financed by ADB or other international and bilateral development agencies.  \n25  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "                                                    2  3                    \n5.  Anticorruption, Fiduciary Issues, Accounting, and Auditing \n \n90.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  of  Pakistan.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \napplicable loan regulations and the bidding documents.  \n \n91.  The Government of Pakistan and the GOB each acknowledge that ADB, consistent with \nits commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, reserves the right to \nundertake, directly or through its agents, investigation of any possible financial or management \nimpropriety in the conduct of the Program. The Government of Pakistan and the GOB will each \ncooperate fully and ensure that each of provincial government\u2019s agencies cooperates with any \nsuch investigation and extends all necessary assistance, including access to relevant books and \nrecords. \n \n92.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for withdrawal applications. Before withdrawal, the Government will \nopen a deposit account at the State Bank of Pakistan to receive all loan proceeds. The account \nwill be managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. The \nFinance Department will be required to submit quarterly progress reports, as well as a final \nreport on the progress of subprogram 1 implementation.  \n \n93.  The Government of Pakistan emphasizes the strengthening of internal control systems \nand overall public financial management. Progress has been made with support from the World \nBank through PIFRA. The project covers the federal Government as well as the four provinces \nin Pakistan. \n \n94.  The policy actions under BRMP II will also complement the anticorruption efforts of the \nGovernment  of  Pakistan.  For  instance,  the  policy  actions  under  CPA  1  will  enhance \ntransparency  and  accountability  in  budget  preparation  and  strengthen  internal  controls  for \nbudget execution. In CPA 2, improvements in pension record-keeping and administration will \nminimize the scope for errors, as well as fraud in the accounting and disbursement of pension \nbenefits. In CPA 3, strengthening governance in the minerals sector will mitigate corruption. \n \n95.  During program preparation, a governance risk assessment was undertaken along the \nlines prescribed by the implementation of the second governance and anticorruption action plan. \nThe  following  were  identified  as  major  governance  risks:  low  government  capacity,  poor \ndepartmental coordination, vested interests, within-year budget reallocations, weak procurement \nsystem,  large  cabinet,  and  political  issues  underlying  the  electric  tube  well  subsidy.  Risk \nmitigation measures include establishing a high-level steering committee to ensure government \ncommitment,  continuous  policy  dialogue  with  provincial  leadership  and  key  stakeholders, \nfrequent  ADB  missions,  TA  support  to  address  capacity  constraints,  and  coordination \nmechanisms. Supplementary Appendix C provides a more detailed risk analysis. \n \n6.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation, Program Review, and Reporting \n \n96.  The GOB and ADB have agreed on a range of outcome and output indicators to monitor \nBRMP II implementation and evaluate its impact within the overall framework of the Program \n(Appendix 1).  \n ", "24   \n97.  The GOB and ADB will periodically review progress implementation and assess the \nimpact of the BRMP II. The GOB will keep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions \nwith other multilateral and bilateral agencies that have implications for BRMP II implementation, \nand will provide ADB with the opportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals. ADB \nand  the  GOB  will  review  subprogram  1  within  3  months  after  its  completion,  and  before \nsubprogram 2 starts, to examine and finalize the design of subprogram 2. The review will reflect \nthe changes that might have occurred in the external policy environment during the program \nperiod, and identify initial lessons. The steering committee will conduct a progress review every \nquarter, and a progress report will be shared with ADB; the first progress report is due in June \n2009. A summary of the progress report will be published on the BRMP website. To assist the \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  of  BRMP  II  implementation,  a  detailed  action  plan  has  been \ndeveloped for subprogram 1. Likewise, for subprogram 2, ADB will develop detailed action plans \nto serve as a guidance document to be revised and enhanced during review missions. BRMP II \ninformation  will  be  disseminated  to  the  public  through  a  dedicated  website.  The  PCU  will \norganize regular workshops and meetings involving civil society to seek ideas from the public \nand to disseminate information related to the program. \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n98.   The objective of the TA for Supporting the Second Balochistan Resource Management \nProgram is to assist the GOB in implementing the Program. Specifically, it aims to (i) improve \nfiscal and financial management, (ii) build capacity in contract negotiations and environmental \nsafeguards within MMD, and (iii) strengthen governance and investment structures and record-\nkeeping in the pension system. \n \n99.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $1 million, of which ADB will provide \n$800,000 equivalent on a grant basis from its TA funding program. The GOB\u2019s contribution of \n$200,000  will  cover  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  and  training  and  workshop \nfacilities. Procurement of goods and services under the TA will conform to ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n100.  The Finance Department will be the Executing Agency for the TA. BOR, ETD, Finance \nDepartment, MMD and P&DD will be the implementing agencies. The TA will be implemented \nover 18 months, starting January 2009. The TA will support 20 person-months of international \nconsulting services and 5 person-months of national consulting services. Consultants will be \nrecruited through firms or individually, depending on the expertise available, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Where firms \nare to be hired, consultant selection may use any selection method under ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants, but preferably the quality- and cost-based selection method. The type of \ntechnical proposal will depend on the contract budgets\u2014simplified technical proposals for contract \nbudgets exceeding $600,000, and biodata technical proposals for contract budgets of $600,000 \nand  below.  Key  activities, cost estimates, and outline  terms  of  reference  for the TA are in \nAppendix 9. \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n101.  BRMP  II  outcomes  will  help  the  GOB  address  some  of  the  binding  constraints  on \neconomic growth by allowing for more efficient use of public resources, and paving the way for \ngreater private investment, especially in the minerals sector. BRMP II will help the GOB apply \n ", "                                                    2  5                    \nenvironmental safeguards in line with best practices to ensure sustainability of growth of the \nminerals sector. Subprogram 1 of BRMP II will aim to address the revenue dimensions first to \nallow the GOB to obtain tangible results with its limited capacity and provide a sound basis for \nmore far-reaching reforms. Improved public resource management will create the necessary \nfiscal space and discipline to allow more spending on social services in the future. \n \n102.  The utilization of loan proceeds will achieve positive impacts. Part of the proceeds will be \nused to capitalize the pension and general provident investment funds. With proper governance \nstructures, as required under BRMP II, the investments will be more prudently managed and the \nfunds are more likely to be financially viable and sustainable. The accumulation under the funds \nwill allow part of the accrued pension and GPF liabilities to be prefunded, creating more fiscal \nspace in the medium and long term to finance social services and development spending. \nPension reform will also benefit current and future pensioners by ensuring that future pension \npayments  will  be  met  by  financially  viable  and  sustainable  pension  scheme  and  general \nprovident fund. The remaining loan proceeds will be used for development spending through the \nsystem  of  performance  grants  to  local  governments.  Under  the  devolved  structure,  this \ntranslates into better education and health services in the districts and improvements in water \nand sanitation services in subdistricts and villages. \n \nB.  Impacts \n103.  Economic  and  Poverty.  BRMP  II  is  a  general  intervention  aimed  at  supporting \nsustainable economic growth. In that respect, it is expected to have an indirect positive effect on \npoverty reduction. The impacts on employment generation, revenue collection, and access to \npublic goods and services are expected to be positive in the long term through the efforts to \nfacilitate private sector development, strengthen public resource management, and improve \nsocial services.  \n \n104.  Institutional.  BRMP  II  will  contribute  significantly  to  institutional  development.  The \nrevenue unit established in the Finance Department under subprogram 1 will enhance the \ncapacity of the provincial administration to generate revenue. The creation of pension and \ngeneral provident investment funds will allow part of the pension and GPF liabilities of the \ngovernment to be prefinanced, creating fiscal space for future development expenditures. \n \n105.  Social. The improvement of public resource management practices, and the enhanced \nmonitoring  of  social  service  delivery,  through  the  public  expenditure  tracking  survey,  will \ngradually improve the quality of those services, especially in key social sectors. A summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \n106.  Resettlement,  Indigenous  People,  and  Environment.  BRMP  II  will  have  positive \nimpacts on the environment by maintaining a cap on the tube well subsidy. The subsidy for \nelectricity used by agricultural tube wells provides a disincentive for farmers to conserve energy \nor save scarce water resources. Recognizing that the minerals sector activities can harm the \nenvironmental  if  improperly  implemented,  BRMP  II  will  develop  capacity  on  environmental \nsafeguard design and contract negotiations. It can also negotiate better deals, which will benefit \ncommunities  within  mining  concession  areas.  BRMP  II  will  not  have  any  involuntary \nresettlement components or any impact on indigenous people.  \n \n ", "26   \nC.  Risks \n107.  The benefits to be realized under BRMP II depend on a number of assumptions and are \nsubject to various risks. Therefore, mitigating measures have been integrated into the design of \nthe Program. \n \n108.  Macroeconomic Risks. Pakistan\u2019s economy remains vulnerable to short-term shocks \nas well as medium-term macroeconomic imbalances. Growth will slow down in 2008-2009, and \nrecovery  will  be  contingent  on  domestic  as  well  as  global  factors.  The  Government  has \nlaunched a medium-term stabilization program with support from development partners. ADB is \na lead partner through its support under the Accelerating Economic Transformation Program.26 \nThis  4-year  program  cluster  aims  to  facilitate  the  structural  transformation  of  Pakistan\u2019s \neconomy, leading to sustained economic growth of 8% per year between 2010 and 2020. \n \n109.  Security and Political Risks. Continued reports of instability, attacks, plots, bombings, \nand even less-destructive activities such as protests and work stoppages affect investors\u2019 views \nof the country\u2019s overall stability. These perceptions affect Balochistan even more, given the \nsecurity concerns in the province. Balochistan\u2019s borders with neighboring countries are porous, \nsmuggling is rampant, and law enforcement is weak. In addition, the province faces the risk of \npolitical and regulatory capture by the local elite and subsequent continuation of privileges. \nAlthough most of these political risks are beyond the control of a program such as BRMP II, the \npolicy actions aim to set up transparent mechanisms for revenue and expenditure management, \nand to increase private sector participation. The introduction of more efficient and accountable \nprocesses and procedures under BRMP II will reduce the risk of political and regulatory capture. \n \n110.  Governance,  Corruption,  and  Bureaucratic  Risks.  Transparent  and  accountable \nprocesses and procedures may be resisted for two reasons. First, the bureaucracy might be \nunwilling to alter established routines. Second, moving away from a discretionary to a rule-\nbased system will likely limit corruption and discourage rent-seeking. The resistance to reforms \nmight be stronger in the second case. BRMP II proposes specific measures that will become \npart of the legal framework, and will track their implementation. \n \n111.  Capacity Constraints. Weak capacity in the province is likely to restrict the pace of \nreform. BRMP II focuses on a limited number of practical actions. Advisory and technical \nsupport through a TA grant will also be provided to the implementing agencies. \n \n112.  Fiscal Sustainability Risk. Balochistan has limited fiscal resources, generates little \nrevenue, and depends heavily on federal transfers, which account for about 93% of its total \nrevenue. At the same time, the GOB has a very high overdraft with the central bank. The GOB \nis committed to increasing its own-source revenue to 9% of its total revenue by FY2010. The \npension reform and other expenditure management measures will help manage contingent \nliabilities and recurrent expenditures better. \n \n                                                 \n26 ADB. 2008.

In addition to the standard assurances, the Government of Pakistan and GOB have \ngiven the following assurance, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Continuity of reform. The Government and GOB will carry out the policies and \nactions in accordance with the schedule of policy reforms contained in the policy \nmatrix  as  agreed  upon  by  the  Government,  GOB,  and  ADB,  and  ensure \nsustainability of the reforms beyond the program period. \n(ii)  Effective  program  management.  The  GOB  will  take  all  steps  and  actions, \nincluding provision of staff and other necessary resources to ensure satisfactory \ncompletion in a timely manner of all program outputs.  \n(iii)  Environmental  assessment.  The  GOB  will  ensure  that  an  appropriate \nenvironmental assessment will be undertaken and necessary environmental and \nsocial safeguards incorporated in the mineral concession contracts.  \n(iv)  Coordination  of  reforms.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  adequate \ninformation is made available to the GOB to facilitate consistency of revenue \nprojections made by the Government and GOB. The Government will provide \nadvice to the GOB on the design of the latter\u2019s fiscal responsibility framework and \nensure  consistency  between  the  Government  and  GOB  frameworks.  The \nGovernment and GOB will coordinate reforms affecting the pension system to \nensure consistency in the federal and provincial schemes. \n(v)  Governance structure for pension and general provident investment funds. \nThe  GOB  will  ensure  that  a  sound  governance  structure,  supported  by  a \ndiversified  investment  policy  and  a  plan  to  implement  the  investment \nmanagement functions for the pension and general provident investment funds, \nis in place before the first substantial capitalization to the funds. Until these are in \nplace, the Government and GOB will ensure that the portion of the counterpart \nfunds to be allocated for the pension and general provident investment funds will \nbe invested in secured investment instruments, acceptable to ADB. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loans Effectiveness \n114.  Prior to the effectiveness of the loans, the Government will cause the GOB to \n \n(i)  ensure that the P&DD will rationalize the PSDP by (a) providing for all incomplete \nschemes  a  full  review  of  cost  estimates  and  phasing  of  schemes;  and \n(b) ensuring that the PSDP throw-forward, excluding mega projects, is reduced to \n3 years;  \n(ii)  ensure that the Finance Department will complete the study on estimation of \ncontingent liabilities of the pension scheme and general provident fund;  \n(iii)  submit to the Provincial Assembly the draft procurement law; and \n(iv)  ensure that BOR will construct valuation tables for determining stamp duty on \ntransactions relating to property transfers and will publish the said tables on the \nGOB website. \n \n ", "28   \nC.

The public financial management and accountability (PFMA) assessment for Balochistan \nwas  released  in  May  2007  using  an  indicator-based  approach  covering  31  indicators \ncategorized  into  seven  groups:  (i)  credibility  of  the  budget;  (ii) comprehensiveness  and \ntransparency; (iii) policy-based budgeting; (iv) predictability and control in budget execution; \n(v) accounting, recording, and reporting; (vi) external scrutiny; and (vii) donor practices. The \nPFMA assessment uses a framework that rates public financial management attributes on a \nfour-grade  scale  from  \u201cA\u201d  to  \u201cD\u201d,  measuring  against  standard  operational  performance \nbenchmarks. A rating of \u201cA\u201d indicates international best practice, and a rating of \u201cB\u201d implies good \nachievement. Ratings of \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD\u201d suggest the need for improvement. \n  \nTable A2: Public Financial Management and Accountability Assessment \n \nIndicator  Score \nA.

Balochistan Public Financial Management and Accountability Assessment. \nPakistan. \n \n2.  In terms of the credibility of the budget, the PFMA assessment found that the aggregate \noutturn in revenues and expenditures exhibit good performance. However, there to appears to \nbe  a  substantial  reallocation  of  actual  expenditures  compared  to  the  original  budget. \nExpenditure payment arrears are not monitored.  \n \n3.  Budget classification complies with international best practices. Budget documents have \nbeen comprehensive and intergovernmental fiscal transfers have been transparent. However, \neffective mechanisms are not in place to take into account the fiscal risks in local governments \nand government-owned entities. The magnitude of off-budget expenditures is also uncertain. \nPublic disclosure in procurement and audit reports is weak. \n \n4.  In  terms  of  policy-based  budgeting,  the  province  tends  to  adhere  to  deadlines, \norderliness, and participation in the budget process. However, the province has not yet adopted \nmultiyear budgeting.  \n \n5.  The  PFMA  assessment  found  that  budget  execution  is generally  weak.  It  performs \npoorly  in  all  aspects  of  taxation.  Likewise,  fiduciary  controls,  such  as  payroll  controls, \nprocurement, internal controls in non-salary expenditures, and internal audit need improvement. \n \n6.  Accounting,  recording,  and  reporting  practices  were  assessed  as  poor.  Account \nreconciliation is inadequate. Data is not collected on resources received by service delivery \nunits. In-year budget reporting by district governments is of poor quality and not timely. Annual \nfinancial statements are delayed due to capacity problems. \n \n7.  External  scrutiny  and  audit  need  significant  improvement.  External  audits  are  often \ncompleted late, audit certifications are delayed, and audit report follow-up is weak. The time for \nlegislative scrutiny of the annual budget is limited. The Public Accounts Committee in the \nProvincial Assembly not only lacks technical capacity but it also has a large backlog of reports \nto be examined. \n \n8.  Practices by donors were rated favorably with budget support operations discussed in \ndetail with the government of Balochistan, and with a large portion of the support managed \nusing national procedures. However, financial information provided by donors for budgeting and \nreporting on program and project aid was rated as poor and needs improvement. \n \n ", "                                                                                 Appendix 3  35\nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Fiscal Sector \n \n1.  Fiscal Performance \n \n1.  Background. In Balochistan, the principal players in fiscal and financial management \nare the Accountant General Office (AGO), Board of Revenue (BOR), Excise and Taxation \nDepartment (ETD), Finance Department, and Planning and Development Department (P&DD). \nOn revenue generation, BOR is in-charge of all land taxes, while ETD collects the non-land \ntaxes and fees. Unlike in other provinces, ETD is supervised by a member of the BOR. In recent \nyears, the Mines and Minerals Department (MMD) has played an increasingly larger role in \nrevenue generation through increased operations in mining. All revenue receipts, both federal \ntransfers and provincial earnings, accrue to accounts managed by the Finance Department, \nbecause it has the mandate to fund the budget.1 During budget execution, internal controls \nwithin departments are mandated in the budget manual, and a series of reconciliations between \ndepartments, the Finance Department, and AGO are undertaken. \n \n2.  Overall Fiscal Performance. Balochistan started the millennium with nearly balanced \nbudgets.  However,  the  fiscal  position  deteriorated  between  FY2003  and  FY2006  as \nexpenditures accelerated rapidly, far outpacing revenue growth. This resulted in large budget \ndeficits, which peaked at PRs8.5 billion in FY2004. Higher development spending and increases \nin current expenditure transfers to local governments were mainly responsible for the expansion \nin overall expenditures. In FY2007, an across-the-board gain in federal transfers\u2014more than \nPRs10  billion  or  34% more  than  the  federal transfers in  previous  fiscal  year\u2014significantly \nboosted  provincial  revenues  and  created  additional  fiscal  space.  This  resulted  in  a  sharp \ncontraction  of  the  budget  deficit  to  PRs244  million,  even  as  local  government  current \nexpenditure transfers and development spending continued to expand. In FY2008, the growth in \nfederal transfers tapered off, largely because of declines in straight transfers, but provincial \nexpenditures continued to rise, mainly for debt servicing, transfers to local governments, general \nadministration expenditures, and development outlays.2 As a result, the budget deficit again \nwidened to PRs3.3 billion. \n \nTable A3.1: Fiscal Balance \n(PRs million) \n   Item   FY2001  FY2002  FY2003  FY2004  FY2005  FY2006  FY2007  FY2008 \nFederal Transfers                 \nFederal Divisible  \n  Pool Taxes  7,218  7,415  8,098  9,018  11,445  12,500  14,380  17,317 \n  Straight Transfers  8,716  9,294  9,003  7,225  9,150  9,179  13,437  10,485 \n  Subventions/Grants  5,102  5,042  5,859  6,001  6,915  8,095  12,207  15,359 \n  Total  21,036  21,751  22,960  22,244  27,510  29,774  40,024  43,161 \nProvincial Tax \n  Receipts   452  474  594  709  761  1,038  882  937 \nProvincial Nontax \n  Receipts   720  652  733  740  778  1,396  1,938  2,282 \n                                                 \n1  Budget preparation is bifurcated in Pakistan and the provinces, with the Finance Department handling the current \nbudget and PDD formulating the development budget. \n2  Straight transfers include net proceeds on federal excise duty on natural gas, royalty on natural gas, net profits on \nbulk generation of hydroelectric power, royalties on crude oil, and gas development surcharges. \n ", "36   Appendix 3 \nItem  FY2001  FY2002  FY2003  FY2004  FY2005  FY2006  FY2007  FY2008 \n  Total  1,172  1,126  1,327  1,449  1,539  2,434  2,820  3,219 \nTotal Revenues  22,208  22,877  24,287  23,693  29,049  32,208  42,844  46,380 \nCurrent Expenditures                 \nGeneral \n  Administration  2,499  2,776  2,223  2,159  2,116  3,284  3,487  4,532 \n  Law and Order   1,976  2,178  2,680  3,060  3,146  3,803  3,974  4,428 \n  Community Services   1,739  1,867  895  1,035  1,138  1,200  1,539  1,094 \n  Social Services   5,766  6,362  2,128  2,044  2,157  2,517  2,812  3,487 \n  Economic Services  2,593  2,087  1,335  1,791  1,942  2,184  2,471  3,114 \n  Transfers to LGs      8,101  9,763  10,811  12,069  14,615  16,128 \nSubsidy (wheat and \n  tube wells)  922  1,503  3,114  1,920  2,531  2,463  2,296  2,626 \n  Debt Servicing  2,999  3,003  2,926  2,642  2,365  2,810  2,818  4,438 \n  Total  18,494  19,776  23,402  24,414  26,206  30,330  34,012  39,847 \nDevelopment \nExpenditures  4,207  2,979  4,607  7,787  8,582  7,558  9,076  9,839 \nTotal Expenditures  22,701  22,755  28,009  32,201  34,788  37,888  43,088  49,686 \nFiscal Balance  (493)  122  (3,722) (8,508) (5,739) (5,680)  (244) (3,306)\n ( ) = negative, LG = local government. \nSource: Government of Balochistan. 2008.

As in other provinces in Pakistan, Balochistan\u2019s \nsources of revenue include (i) the province\u2019s share of federal taxes, transferred through the \nNational  Finance  Commission  award;3  (ii)  straight  transfers  from  the  federal  Government, \nlargely excise duties and royalties on petroleum and natural gas extracted from fields in the \nprovince; (iii) subventions, or special grants from the federal Government, which are awarded to \nBalochistan in acknowledgement of the province\u2019s low development status; and (iv) provincial \nown-source tax and nontax revenues. Revenue from the province\u2019s share of federal taxes, or \ntransfers from the divisible pool, constitute the greatest single source of revenue at 37.3% of \ntotal revenues in FY2008, while straight transfers constitute 22.6%.4  \n \n4.  Share of Provincial Own Source Revenue. Balochistan remains heavily dependent on \nthe federal Government for resource transfers. However, the share of own-source revenue in \ntotal provincial revenue increased from 5.5% in FY2003 to 6.9% in FY2008, and is expected to \nrise further in the medium term because of larger royalties from the mining sector. In absolute \nterms, provincial own-source revenues more than doubled from PRs1.3 billion in FY2003 to \nPRs3.2 billion in FY2008.  \n \n5.  Provincial Tax Revenue. The motor vehicle tax, which is levied according to the engine \ncapacity of vehicles, is the most lucrative tax in the province, accounting for 27% of total \nprovincial tax revenue in FY2008.5 Motor vehicle tax rates were raised under first Balochistan \nResource  Management  Program  (BRMP  I).  Provincial  excise,  levied  primarily  on  liquor, \ncontributes an additional 24%. Advance payment of provincial excise tax on liquor has been \nrequired since 2005 to prevent the accumulation of arrears. Collections from this tax exceed \n                                                 \n3  Federal taxes, which form part of the divisible pool, include sales tax, income tax, customs, and excise duties. \n4  These proportions have changed from FY2002, when straight transfers were the single largest source of revenue \nat 40.6% of total revenue, while transfers from the divisible pool constituted 32.4% of the total. \n5  The share of motor vehicle tax in provincial tax revenues has remained at 25%\u201332% for the past 5 years. \n ", "                                                                                 Appendix 3  37\nPRs200 million in FY2008. Stamp duty yielded 22% of provincial tax revenue in FY2008.6 Thus, \nthe three taxes account for almost 75% of provincial tax revenue. Property tax and land revenue \ntogether yield barely 13% of provincial tax revenue, while capital gains tax, professional tax, and \ntax on the transfer of property also remain low-yielding taxes. Capital gains tax has been \nreduced  to  a  \u201cvoluntary\u201d  tax  in  that  only  other  government  entities  or  private  commercial \nenterprises that have to fulfill internal legal requirements pay the tax. The agricultural income tax \nenacted in 2000 remains suspended even though the drought that affected the province has \nended.  \n \nTable A3.2: Provincial Own-Source Revenues \n(PRs million) \n Item  FY2003  FY2004  FY2005  FY2006  FY2007  FY2008 \nProvincial Tax Receipts             \nUrban Immovable Property Tax  50.00   36.49   41.40   40.00   38.00   38.00  \nTax on Transfer of Property  13.80   11.28   15.46   17.54   18.20   20.50  \nLand Revenue  43.92   89.60   45.47   52.51   74.80   83.71  \nWorkers Welfare Tax    0.02          \nCapital Gains Tax  1.00     1.70   1.50   1.00   1.00  \nSales Tax    4.96         \u2014 \nProfessional Tax  1.32   1.03   1.14   0.80   0.85   0.85  \nProvincial Excise  165.42   215.86   225.00   224.62   216.89   224.87  \nStamp Duty  70.57   100.99   141.45   162.10   176.00   207.50  \nMotor Vehicle Tax  173.67   227.45   190.63   222.96   253.48   256.12  \nOther Indirect Taxes  74.52   21.63   98.76   100.08   102.85   104.80  \nTotal  594.21   709.31   761.01   822.11   882.08   937.35  \nProvincial Nontax Receipts             \nInterest  0.44   0.08   0.08   7.21   131.25   15.53  \nDividends  10.72   3.44   23.27   13.36   28.12   28.01  \nExamination Fee  21.15   1.18   0.19   0.45   2.92   2.65  \nFee of the Government Audit          0.80   1.25  \nPension Contribution  1.45   1.55   1.29   2.19   1.69   1.97  \nWeights and Measures  2.75   2.14   1.55   2.36   1.91   2.35  \nJustice  25.14   18.12   22.33   21.31   56.32   75.01  \nPolice  9.12   33.60   37.63   37.03   75.67   105.57  \nJails  0.86   9.95   3.81   0.15   3.95   0.33  \nCivil Works  14.78   49.47   33.02   36.32   39.25   42.05  \nPublic Health  15.68   25.57   25.00   17.04   26.90   20.00  \nEducation  18.77   9.92   12.16   9.10   8.54   9.46  \nHealth  28.68   23.53   28.42   37.85   47.11   45.04  \nManpower  0.83   0.22   4.62   29.98   24.01   19.88  \nSocial Welfare      1.81   0.15   0.20   0.15  \nAgriculture  107.41   122.05   149.33   139.15   161.14   172.23  \nFisheries  3.85   2.40   4.01   6.17   30.45   4.03  \n                                                 \n6  The yield from stamp duty has tripled over the past 5 years, largely due to significant increases in property prices. \n ", "38   Appendix 3 \n Item  FY2003  FY2004  FY2005  FY2006  FY2007  FY2008 \nAnimal Husbandry  26.16  14.12  63.72   31.16   33.06   35.24 \nForest  6.05  5.17  14.74   14.02   25.01   34.23 \nIrrigation  37.32  74.92  125.32   145.73   69.85   61.21 \nBoard of Revenue (Abiana)a          9.41   1.33 \nIndustries  5.61  3.01  0.37   10.84   11.69   18.00 \nPrinting and Stationery  6.03  1.03  6.53   6.63   6.50   7.30 \nMines and Mineralsb    3.18    180.00   353.26   500.00 \nExtraordinary Receipt        215.50   806.30   900.00 \nOther Miscellaneous Receipts  389.99  334.37  218.66   648.30   22.63   177.54 \nTotal   732.77  739.01  777.82    1,612.00    1,977.93    2,280.36 \nTotal Provincial Own-Source \nRevenues  1,326.98  1,448.32  1,538.82    2,434.11    2,860.01    3,217.71 \na  Abiana is water charges for irrigation. \nb  Includes development surcharge and royalties. \nNote: FY2003 to FY2006 are actual data.

Provincial  nontax  revenue  constituted  70.9%  of  total \nprovincial own-source revenue in FY2008, up from 55.2% in FY2003. Land sales account for \nthe largest share of nontax revenue. Notable increases in nontax revenue have accrued in the \npast 2 years from interest and dividends.7 Revenue from accounts such as police and justice \nsystems has also increased.8 However the single largest increase in nontax revenue is from \nmines and minerals royalties, which have grown from PRs180 million in FY2006 to PRs500 \nmillion in FY2008. Further increases in royalties are expected in the medium term when the \nReko Diq mine (gold and copper) and the Dudder mine (zinc and copper) start production.  \n \n7.  Expenditures. Between FY2003 and FY2008, the two largest components of current \nexpenditures were transfers to local governments (averaging about 40% of the total) and the \nwage bill, i.e., pay and allowances (averaging about 22%). After declining from 13% to 8% \nbetween FY2003 and FY2007, debt service\u2019s share of current expenditures rose to 11% in \nFY2008, mainly because of the deferred cash development loans (CDLs) and overdraft interest \npayments.  Pension  payments  have  nearly  doubled  from  PRs0.9  billion  to  PRs1.5  billion, \nalthough its share of the total has remained flat at about 3.4%. Subsidies have remained at \nabout PRs2.5 billion since FY2005, with their share of the total has declined from 9.7% in \nFY2005 to 6.6% in FY 2008, because of the cap on tube well subsidies. Non-salary spending, \nmainly  for  operations  and  maintenance,  is  being  crowded  out  by  other  expenditures,  as \nindicated  by  its  declining  share  of  expenditures  and  having  the  slowest  growth  among \nexpenditures. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7  These increases may not represent significant changes in revenue collection efforts, but instead accrue from better \naccounting and book-keeping practices wherein departments whose receipts were previously not reported are now \nbeing recorded. \n8  These increases accrue from the re-designation of B areas, which are policed by the levies and other militias, to A \nareas, which are covered by the provincial police. \n ", "                                                                                 Appendix 3  39\nTable A3.3: Current Expenditures, by Economic Classification \n(PRs million) \nItem  FY2003  FY2004  FY2005  FY2006  FY2007  FY2008 \nPay  2,792  3,030  3,186  3,790  4,296  5,109 \nAllowances  1,676  2,176  2,636  3,458  3,813  4,736 \nPension  857  808  857  943  1,181  1,506 \nDebt Service  2,926  2,642  2,365  2,811  2,818  4,438 \nTransfer to LGs  8,101  9,763  10,811  12,069  14,615  16,128 \nSubsidies  1,614  1,920  2,531  2,468  2,296  2,627 \nNon-Salary   5,436  4,884  6,677  5,735  6,174  6,810 \nTotal  23,402  24,415  26,205  30,330  34,012  39,848 \nLG = local government. \nSource: Government of Balochistan. 2008.

In FY2008, the development budget is estimated to \nhave reached almost PRs10 billion. Development spending is highly concentrated on road \ninfrastructure, accounting for about 43% of the FY2008 Public Sector Development Program \n(PSDP). Spending on education accounts for only 4% of provincial PSDP, while health accounts \nfor only 1%. BRMP I advocated the rationalization of the PSDP. Departments were encouraged \nto include only approved schemes in their request for development funds, as well as to abide by \nbudget schedules for the approval of new schemes. These requirements reduced the size of the \nthrow forward of the PSDP, excluding mega projects, to 4 years from 10 years.9 Funding for \ndevelopment spending has not been sufficient; much of the province\u2019s receipts allocated for \ncurrent expenditures. Such a deficiency in revenues has resulted in overdrafts with the State \nBank of Pakistan (SBP).  \n   \n9.  Public Debt. Balochistan\u2019s total public debt was PRs53.6 billion at the end of FY2008. \nThe government of Balochistan (GOB) has engaged in debt swaps, replacing expensive CDLs \nwith ADB loans. As such, outstanding CDLs totaled PRs1.8 billion at the end of FY2008. \nHowever, debt service remains high because of deferred interest payments on CDLs and the \naccumulation of overdrafts with the SBP to cover development spending. At the end of FY2008, \noverdrafts totaled PRs16.3 billion. As part of its debt management strategy, the GOB has \nconverted the overdrafts into less expensive blocked loans at the start of FY2009. \n \n2.  Budget Process \n10.  Procedures for budget preparation and execution are found in the Balochistan Budget \nManual (1987), which has not been updated since 1987. Balochistan is using the financial and \nadministrative rules, codes, and manuals applicable to the federal Government, as well as those \nof the defunct province of West Pakistan, which have not been revised. \n \n11.  Budget preparation starts when the Finance Department issues the budget call circular. \nUnder the circular, departments are requested to prepare and submit a statement of permanent \n                                                 \n9  A throw forward is the excess of the cost of a development scheme over the current financial year\u2019s allocation, and \nis one of the measures used to analyze the sustainability of the development budget. It provides information on \nhow many years it will take to complete a development scheme, or in how many future budgets the scheme will \nhave to appear. \n ", "40   Appendix 3 \nexpenditures and proposals for new expenditures for the current budget. P&DD prepares the \nbudget for development expenditure of each department in consultation with that department.  \n \n12.  Recurring  expenditures  (such  as  salaries,  allowances,  pensions,  and  other  office \nexpenditure)  are  generally  not  subject  to  review.  However,  new  current  expenditures  are \nreviewed  in  detail  by  the  Finance  Department  together  with  the  concerned  department. \nMeetings between the Finance Department and other departments to review the statement of \nnew expenditure are held from March to May. \n \n13.  The  projections  for  provincial  own-source  revenue  are  prepared  by  the  relevant \ndepartment  and  then  discussed  with  the  Finance  Department  before  finalization  and \nincorporation in the budget. Expected federal transfers to the province for the following year are \nintimated by the federal Government generally in May (tentative figures) and then are firmed up \nin early June of each year. \n \n14.  For development expenditures, P&DD and the concerned department review project \nproposals. Project documents, i.e., PC-I or PC-II, for major investment projects are prepared \nand scrutinized, keeping in view their future current expenditure requirements.10 The review of \ndevelopment and current expenditures continues until April or May. Based on this review, \nexpenditure projections are finalized. Departments prepare statements of revised estimates for \nthe current fiscal year, which are submitted to the Finance Department in April. This is based on \n8 months of actual expenditures and 4 months of projected expenditures.  \n \n15.  Based on the expected share in revenues from the federal Government, the expenditure \nbudget, especially the size of the PSDP, is adjusted and budget documents prepared.11 The \nbudget is approved by the chief minister and the Cabinet before presentation in the Provincial \nAssembly. The budget is presented by the provincial finance minister before the members of the \nProvincial Assembly in a budget session. The budget proposals are then discussed at length, \nand the budget is approved in the light of the discussion and suggestions by the members. The \napproved  budget  is  disseminated  to  the  provincial  secretaries,  who  act  as  the  principal \naccounting officers for their departments.  \n \n16.  The Finance Department releases the current budget quarterly to the relevant provincial \ndepartments through their administrative secretaries. The secretaries allocate the budgets to the \nrelevant officers, who release these to the drawing and disbursing officers.12 \n   \n17.  P&DD  authorizes  the  release  of  development  funds  by  the  Finance  Department  to \nprovincial departments. The Finance Department then places these funds at the disposal of the \nrelevant secretaries to increase development expenditure in accordance with the development \nschemes approved by the P&DD. The department may spend part of the development funds \ndirectly or, in case of civil works, release the funds to the secretary of the Communication and \nWorks Department. P&DD receives progress reports of the development projects, including \n                                                 \n10 PC-I and PC-II are prescribed forms issued by the Planning Commission of Pakistan for project documents on \ndevelopment schemes. \n11  In the following year\u2019s budget, comparative figures are to be given for the current year\u2019s budgeted and revised \nestimates, as well as the actual accounts of the previous year. \n12  For example, in Public Health Engineering Department, the secretary releases budget to the two chief engineers. \nThe chief engineers then release the budgets to Executive District Officers of the relevant district (who are the \ndrawing and disbursing officers) for operation through Account No. 1, which is the account that funds provincial \ngovernment expenditures. \n ", "                                                                                 Appendix 3  41\nforeign-funded  projects,  from  the  departments,  and  matches  expenditure  against  budget \nallocation. \n \n18.  During budget execution, re-appropriation powers are distributed at various levels. The \nsecretary of a provincial department, acting as the principal accounting officer, is responsible for \nthe proper implementation of the budget. The secretary is required to submit two statements of \nexcesses and surrenders, which compare the budgetary provision to the actual expenditure for \nthe elapsed period and the expected expenditure for the remaining period. The statements are \nsubmitted on specified forms to the Finance Department by 1 January and 31 March. Based on \na review of the budget in March (after the second excess and surrender statement is prepared), \nthe strategy for budget implementation is modified for the rest of the fiscal year. If funds for \nadditional  expenditures  are  not  available  through  re-appropriation  of  grants,  the  Finance \nDepartment  allows  a  supplementary  grant.  This  grant  is  subject  to  final  approval  by  the \nProvincial Assembly through a supplementary budget, which is approved when the following \nyear\u2019s budget is presented. \n \n3.  Internal Controls \n \n19.  Receipts. All funds collected by the GOB accrue either to the consolidated fund or the \npublic  account.  All  receipts,  capital,  and  revenue  of  the  government  form  part  of  the \nconsolidated fund; all funds collected by the GOB on behalf of other parties, or held in a trust for \nspecial purposes and therefore not available for government expenditures, are public account \nreceipts. Revenue public account receipts are kept in the name of GOB; revenue receipts of the \nGOB are included in the consolidated fund and public account receipts in the public account. \n \n20.  The process and procedures for revenue receipts of the GOB and the internal controls \nare defined for the revenue categories and the collection agencies in detail by each collection \nagency (for instance, the BOR and the ETD). However, they are required to adhere to the \nprinciples prescribed by the Auditor General of Pakistan.  \n \n21.  Expenditures. Expenditures are accounted for on a cash or commitment basis. The \nfollowing key steps are prescribed for all expenditure transactions: \n(i)  sanction of expenditure; \n(ii)  preparation of claim voucher (bill) for payment, except for salaries and wages; \n(iii)  approval of expenditure; \n(iv)  registration of claim voucher or purchase order; \n(v)  certification of pre-audit claims; \n(vi)  authorization of payment; \n(vii)  issue of payment; and \n(viii)  recording of expenditure in the accounts. \n \n22.  The sanction process involves a budget availability review for all expenditures, and a \npurchase order for contingent expenditures. A prescribed claim voucher is prepared for services \nrendered or work done under a contract or similar arrangement (above a certain limit), or for \ntravel expenses. The claim voucher or purchase order are approved and registered by the \nofficer  after  reviewing  the  correctness  of  the  claim  and  ensuring  that  all  supporting \ndocumentation is attached. Certification of pre-audit expenditures involves verification (i.e., the \nclaim voucher is approved and is valid in accordance with specified procedures, the head of the \naccount to be charged is specified, and required funds are available) and audit to identify \npossible fraud and irregularities. Authorization of payment is performed by the district accounts \nofficer (or treasury officer, in districts where treasury officers perform the functions of district \n ", "42   Appendix 3 \naccount officers) or by the accountant general, but not by the same person who is the certifying \nofficer, unless specifically approved by the auditor general. Payment is made to the claimant for \nclaims which have been approved, certified and authorized for expenditure through checks with \ntwo authorized signatories. All payments are made by check except for those pertaining to \nintergovernmental  transfers,  certain  salaries,  pension  and  provident  fund  payments,  and \npayments from imprest accounts. Recording of payments is covered by principles and practices \ndefined by the auditor general and procedures for each category of expenditure (e.g., salaries, \npensions,  provident  fund,  contractor  or  work  payments,  loans  and  advances,  international \npayments, grants-in-aid, and contributions) specified in the accounting and treasury manuals. \nPermanent accounting records consist of the establishment register, payroll register, pension \nregister, and general provident fund ledger. \n \n23.  Treasury  and  Accounting  Functions.  Unlike  in  other  provinces,  only  a  district \naccounts office (DAO Office) has been established in Balochistan (in Lasbela, Uthal District). \nTreasury offices, which are under the Finance Department, carry out the pre-auditing and \naccounting functions in addition to undertaking Treasury functions. In Khuzdar and Sibi, the \nAccountant General Office (AGO) has set up suboffices to carry out the accounting functions for \na cluster of selected treasury offices, while AGO performs those functions in Quetta. While \nadministratively the treasury offices are under the Finance Department, they are responsible to \nAGO for their accounting functions. Treasury and accounting functions at the provincial level are \nshown in Table A3.4.13 \n \nTable A3.4: Functions of District Accounts Office,  \nAccountant General Suboffices, and Treasury \n \nAccountant \nFunction  DAO  General Suboffice  Treasury \n  (Lasbela)  (Khuzdar and Sibi)  (all districts) \nMaintenance of general provident  Yes  Yes  No \nfund and pension record \nPay slips/ salary fixation  Yes  Yes  No \nPre-audit and approval of payments\u2014 By audit staff of  Yes (treasury staff)  Yes (treasury \nfederal Government, provincial  AGO  staff) \ndepartments, district governments \nIssue of checks  By DAO  By treasury officer  By treasury \nofficer \nPayments  By treasury staff  By treasury staff  By treasury staff \nEntries in books of accounts (such as  By treasury staff  By treasury staff  By treasury staff \nbudget control registers (functional \nand economic classification), receipts, \nregisters, payment registers, salaries \nand deductions register, jottings, cash \nbooks, state bank deposits register). \nSeparate books for federal, provincial, \nand district governments. \nProvincial Government Accounts       \nSubmission of monthly detailed lists  No  Yes  Yes \nof provincial government receipts and \nexpenditure (with vouchers) to the \nAGO  \n                                                 \n13 The discussions and tables are based on the following: Finance Department, Government of Balochistan. 2006. \nFinancial Management Assessment.

Financial Management Assessment. Quetta. \n \n24.  Reconciliation Procedures. In Balochistan, reconciliation of expenditures by disbursing \nand drawing officers and verification of monthly expenditure statements are important functions \nof the treasury offices and AGO. The following reconciliation procedures are carried out by \nthese offices: \n \n(i)  At the AGO, expenditure figures by function and object, which are produced from \nthe accounting record by two sections of AGO, are reconciled. Subsequently, \nAGO  reconciles  the  monthly  expenditure  statements  prepared  by  different \ndepartments with its figures. \n(ii)  At the provincial department, drawing and disbursing officers prepare monthly \nexpenditure statements, which are reconciled with the figures of the treasury \nofficers and district account officers. Subsequently, the statements are certified. \nDrawing and disbursing officers send their certified expenditure statements to \ntheir  principal  accounting  officers  for  consolidation  and  preparation  of  a \nconsolidated expenditure statement for the department. Departments reconcile \nthe consolidated monthly expenditures with the figures of AGO. \n(iii)  Departments  forward  monthly  reconciled  expenditure  figures  to  the  Finance \nDepartment using a prescribed format. AGO likewise provides an expenditure \nstatement for each department to budget sections in the Finance Department to \nconfirm that the expenditure is in line with the budget releases. Differences are \nreferred to AGO and the relevant department for reconciliation. In cases where \nthe department is either unable to reconcile or faces delays in reconciliation, the \nfigure provided by the AGO is considered final. \n \n ", "44   Appendix 3 \nB.  Civil Service Pension System \n25.  The GOB employs 142,629 workers and pays about 33,000 pension beneficiaries.14 The \ngovernment provides a two-layer old-age protection system to its civil servants, consisting of a \npension scheme and a general provident fund (GPF). In addition, the GOB provides for group \ninsurance and a benevolent payment. Monthly contributions are collected from the civil servants \ngross pay for the GPF, group insurance, and benevolent pay. The pensions are paid from the \nprovincial budget. All benefit payments are made on a pay-as-you-go basis.  \n \n26.  The pension scheme pays 2.33% of monthly final basic wage for each year of service, \nproviding up to 70% final basic wage replacement. The workers must complete at least 10 years \nof service to collect a monthly pension benefit and up to 30 years of service can be counted in \nthe calculations. Benefits can be collected after 25 years of service or upon reaching age 60. Up \nto 35% of the pension can be commuted and taken as a lump sum. The remainder is paid \nmonthly basis as an old-age, survivor, or disability benefit. \n \n27.  The  GPF  is  a  notional  defined-contribution  scheme.  Civil  servants  are  required  to \ncontribute 3%\u20138% of their basic salary to the GPF, depending on the level of income. The \ncontributions are registered as a book reserve with an administered rate of return (contributions \nare posted monthly to a record-keeping system, and an interest rate determined by the Ministry \nof Finance is credited annually to workers accounts). The GOB, which uses the proceeds as \nbudgetary support, pays a higher-than-market markup (on average 11% per year) on a pay-as-\nyou-go  basis.  The  full  amount  of  a  worker\u2019s  account  balance  (contributions  plus  annually \ncredited earnings minus loans outstanding) can be withdrawn in a lump sum upon retirement.  \n \n28.  The monthly deductions from the civil servants gross salary for the group insurance are \npaid as premiums to the State Life Insurance Company and provide a death benefit. The \nbenevolent payment covers a range of benefits, such as a monthly payment to dependents \nupon death in service, marriage benefits, funeral grants, and education scholarships. \n \n1.  Growing Pension and Employee Benefit Liabilities \n29.  Employee benefits have been paid on a pay-as-you-go basis. However, the accrued \nliabilities  are  growing  rapidly.  Initial  estimates  by  the  Finance  Department  show  a  fivefold \nincrease in pension and GPF liabilities between FY1997 and FY2007. Likewise, the group \ninsurance payout has quadrupled over the same period. The liabilities for FY2007 are estimated \nat PRs942.78 million for pensions, PRs561.94 million for GPF, and PRs99.56 million for group \ninsurance. \n \n30.  The  GOB  recognizes  that  the  growing  liabilities  have  important  implications  for  the \nprovincial budget. It also realizes that urgent reforms are needed to ascertain the financial \nsustainability of the employee benefit system, as well as to create the needed fiscal space for \npriority  development  expenditures.  A  Pension  Section  was  established  in  the  Finance \nDepartment to quantify the accrued liabilities of the GOB and to advise on planning of budgetary \nallocations. In addition, the GOB is planning to set up a fund management mechanism for all \nfour benefits to prefinance part of the obligations.  \n \n                                                 \n14  Actuarial Office, Islamabad, and Balochistan Provincial Accountant General Office. \n ", "                                                                                 Appendix 3  45\n2.  Gaps in Record-Keeping and Payment System of Pension and General \nProvident Fund Benefits \n31.  The AGO in Balochistan is responsible for the administration of the pension and GPF \nbenefits. Its functions include (i) government payroll administration, including the registration \nand record-keeping of the civil servants; (ii) pension scheme benefit determination, payment of \nannuity benefits, and lump sum commutations; and (iii) GPF record-keeping and payment of \nlump sum distributions.  \n \n32.  The system of record-keeping and benefit calculation is still largely manual and paper-\nbased, which results in problems regarding the accuracy of pension entitlement calculation and \nindividual payments. However, the manual system is gradually being replaced by an automated \nsystem under the Project for Improvement in Financial Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA),15 using \nsoftware that allows registering the payroll, pension, and GPF data needed to determine the \neligibility and the benefit amount. The pension and GPF modules are still largely unused, as key \ninformation still needs to be collected and entered into the system.  \n \n33.  At retirement, the civil servant applies for the pension and GPF benefits with the AGO, \nwhich is a lengthy process. The claimant has to complete the pension payment order, which \nneeds to be cleared by the claimant\u2019s department. The claimant then has to travel to the AGO in \nQuetta to seek approval.  \n \n34.  To collect the first pension payment, the pensioner must present the payment booklet to \na local branch of the National Bank of Pakistan. Subsequent pension payments can be done \nthrough the district treasury office. Fraud is being prevented by requiring the beneficiary to \nappear in person, although this is not required on a monthly basis. A local district official is \nrequired to make a life certification of a pensioner, but this is not routinely enforced, resulting in \nthe continuation of fraudulent benefit claims after death. Leaks in the system, in the form of \n\u201cghost\u201d employees and \u201cghost\u201d pensioners, are believed to be significant, but are based on \nanecdotal evidence. \n \n3.  Weak Employee Benefit Structure \n35.  The pension scheme for civil servants was inherited from the period of British rule, when \nthe composition and size of the civil service was different. It has not been altered fundamentally \nfor more than a century. Certain features of the pension scheme have led to inequitable and \narbitrary outcomes for some individuals. At the same time, the unfunded pension and GPF \nliabilities  are  imposing  an  increasing  burden  on  the  budget  of  the  provincial  government. \nPension  reform  is  required  to  develop  an  equitable,  adequate,  and  sustainable  retirement \nsystem that is tailored to the needs of a modern civil service. \n \n36.  In addition, there is a high level of dissatisfaction with the current employee benefit \nstructure. When a civil servant dies, benefit payments overlap considerably. At the same time, \ncivil servants feel that the benefit package at retirement is small, offering limited replacement \nincome for the pensioner, but at a relatively large cost to the government. Streamlining of the \nemployee benefit package seems advisable. \n \n                                                 \n15  PIFRA is a multiyear, multi-phased World Bank project designed to automate, standardize, link, and improve all \naspects of financial reporting and analysis related to all agencies of the national Government. \n ", "46   Appendix 3 \n4.  Recent Achievements \n37.  In  2007,  the  GOB  passed  the  Balochistan  Pension  Fund  Management  Authority \nOrdinance, the Balochistan General Provident Investment Fund Ordinance, and the Provincial \nEmployees Group Insurance Ordinance in preparation for the creation of a fund management \nmechanism for pensions, GPF, and group insurance. An actuarial valuation is being prepared to \nestimate the accrued liabilities and determine the funding requirements for the pension and GPF \nfunds. A time-bound action plan is prepared to establish professional fund management.  \n \n38.  A major improvement in the AGO record-keeping system is to be expected from the \ntransition from a paper-based to a computerized system, using software for payroll, pension, \nand  GPF  data  registration.  As  of  May  2008,  only  the  provincial  AGO  in  Quetta  and  the \nAccountant General suboffice in Uthal District had an operational database developed under \nPIFRA. The provincial AGO does the payroll for Quetta, Mastung, and Pishin districts, and has \n52,000 civil servants on its payroll. The Accountant General  suboffice in Uthal District has \n5,000 civil servants on its payroll. By the end of 2008, AGO plans to have all pensioners in the \nprovince entered into the system. With ADB assistance, AGO has gathered and verified the \nGPF records for the civil servants in 15 of 30 districts, and this information will be entered into \nthe database.16 The automation of the payroll, pension, and GPF databases will allow for more \naccurate actuarial valuations of the pension and GPF liabilities, as well as for the future transfer \nof the GPF contributions to the general provident fund. \n \n39.  In contrast to the other provinces in Pakistan, all accounting operations, including the \nrecord-keeping and determination of pension and GPF benefits, are centralized in the AGO in \nQuetta. These services are not provided in the districts. With assistance from PIFRA, AGO is \nupgrading treasury offices and gradually introducing the provision of accounting, pension, and \nGPF services to the districts. At the end of September 2008, six treasury offices had partially \nexpanded their functions, performing the payroll and GPF functions, as well as the limited \naccounting functions under the financial accounting and budgeting system. For the time being, \nthe pension functions remain centralized in the AGO. As an interim measure, AGO is creating \nfive temporary Accountant General suboffices across the province. This will allow retiring civil \nservants to submit their pension claim to these offices, rather than in the provincial AGO in \nQuetta. \n \nC.  Minerals Sector \n \n  1.  Brief Description of the Mineral Resources in Balochistan \n   \n40.  Mineral development, which generates royalties, remains inadequate and slow because \nof technical, financial, organizational, and other problems inherent in the industry. Unlike other \ndeveloping regions with significant mineral endowments, Balochistan has not been able to \nadequately exploit its geological potential. Although Balochistan has more than half of the \ncountry\u2019s prospective minerals, it accounts for slightly more than one-fifth of national mining \nGDP. Despite indigenous and external problems, efforts are being made to build the minerals \nsector into a potent force in the economy and source of government resources. \n \n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendations of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans and \nTechnical Assistance Grants to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Balochistan Resource Management Program. \nManila (Loan 2109-PAK, approved on 25 November, for $130 million).  \n ", "                                                                                 Appendix 3  47\n41.  Balochistan  accounts  for  40%  of  primary  energy  production  in  Pakistan,  leading \nparticularly in the production of coal. 41 minerals are currently being mined. Nine minerals, \nincluding coal, copper, zinc, and marble, account for more than 95% of the total volume of \nminerals mined in the province. Balochistan has granted 1,237 mining licenses, but the scale of \noperations in the sector remains small. It accounted for only 0.23% of the total employed \nworkers in the province in FY2006.  \n \n42.  Balochistan\u2019s mineral wealth can be divided into four categories:  \n \n(i)  Metallic  minerals.  The  province  has  deposits  of  metallic  minerals  such  as \ncopper, gold, chromite, titanium, and antimony, which require larger-scale mining \noperations  and  significant  investment,  sophisticated  mining  processes,  and \ninternational technical expertise. These minerals would be mined primarily for \nexport, and can potentially be large foreign exchange earners.  \n(ii)  Coal  mining.  Balochistan  is  estimated  to  have  the  largest  coal  deposits  in \nPakistan, and could play a significant role in national power generation. Coal is \nmined on a large scale in most countries, but the geological seams for coal in \nBalochistan are divided among a number of small operators, with small-scale \noperations being the norm.  \n(iii)  Industrial minerals. Industrial minerals, such as granite, marble, gypsum, and \nlimestone, are mined in Balochistan. Markets for these minerals can be found in \nthe  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise  sector,  as  well  as  in  large-scale \nmanufacturing like cement. \n(iv)  Artisanal or small-scale mining. This form of mining is mostly for extraction of \nmarble and granite, and its products are used primarily in microenterprises. \n \n43.  The only major mine in Pakistan is at Saindak in Balochistan, which produces gold and \ncopper. The Saindak export-processing zone covers 520 hectares. Other key mining operations \nin the province include the Reko Diq copper and gold deposits in Chaghi district and the Duddar \nlead and zinc deposits in Lasbela. All of these are expected to significantly increase revenues \nfrom royalties, which accrue to the provincial government, in the medium to long term. Pakistan \nhas joint ventures with companies from the People\u2019s Republic of China, as well as a Chilean \ncompany, to develop mines. Incentives include 5% customs duties on imports of plant and \nmachinery, no sales tax, and a depreciation allowance of 50% on machinery and equipment. \n \n  2.  Legal and Institutional Framework, and Governance Structures \n \n    a.  Laws and Regulations Covering the Sector \n   \n44.  Legal provisions related to mining and minerals in Balochistan include the following: \n \n(i)  The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, as amended and \nrestored. \n(ii)  The Regulation of Mines and Oil Fields and Mineral Development (Government \nControl) Act, 1948; Act No. XXIV of 1948. \n(iii)  National  Mineral  Policy  (NMP),  1995  (Government  of  Pakistan,  Ministry  of \nPetroleum and Natural Resources, March 2002). \n(iv)  Pakistan  Environmental  Protection  Agency  Review  of  Initial  Environmental \nExamination  and  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Regulations,  2000  (as \npublished  by  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  Local  Government  and  Rural \nDevelopment in The Gazette of Pakistan, 15 June 2000). \n ", "48   Appendix 3 \n(v)  Balochistan  Minerals  Rules,  2002\u2014to  implement  provisions  of  NMP,  1995 \n(government of Balochistan, Mines and Minerals Department, 8 March 2002). \n \nb.  Licensing and Leasing Procedures  \n \n45.  The National Mineral Policy standardizes mineral licenses (concessions) into four types:  \n \n(i)  Reconnaissance license. This is a nonexclusive, nonrenewable license, which \nis valid for 1 year for an area of 100\u201310,000 square kilometers. Decisions for \nsecuring such licenses are to be delivered in 120 days. \n(ii)  Exploration licenses. This license is for more than 10% of an area covered by a \nreconnaissance license and not exceeding 1,000 square kilometers. Exploration \nlicenses are valid for 3 years. Two 3-year renewals are permitted, and for each \nsuccessive renewal, the area will be reduced by 50%. Applications for these \nlicenses are decided in 120 days. \n(iii)  Mineral  deposit  retention  license.  In  case  of  unfavorable  economics,  this \nlicense  will  enable  the  licensee  to  retain  the  area  for  2  years  (with  1-year \nextension). Applications for mineral deposit retention license are decided in 180 \ndays. \n(iv)  Mining license and/or lease. This lease is for areas up to 250 square kilometers \nand is valid for 30 years with a 10-year extension. Decisions for such licenses \nare awarded in 120 days. \n \n46.  In practice, the Mines and Minerals Department (MMD) issues prospecting and mining \nlicenses to prospective mine operators. The procedures are as follows: \n \n(i)  Prospecting licenses. The MMD issues prospecting licenses, awarding a plot of \n0.4-0.8 square kilometers to a prospector for 2 years.17 At the time of application, \nthe prospector has to obtain approval from the district coordination officer of the \ndistrict where the operation will be carried out. The district coordination officer \napproves the prospecting exercise only if the land is not encumbered and is \nowned by the government, and if issuance of the lease is not likely to create any \nlaw and order issues. The Mines Committee checks that the land being given for \nprospecting or mining lease is clear; if there is a boundary dispute, the committee \nsettles the boundary dispute before such an allotment. After completion of the \nrequirements, the applicant gets an allotment letter with the condition that he or \nshe will have to submit a prospecting scheme. The prospecting scheme has to \ninclude details on the mining method, number of employees, accommodation for \nlabor, provision of a mosque, and water supply. Upon approval of the scheme, \nthe director general of MMD issues a work order. The initial fee with application is \nPRs25,000; and after receiving the offer letter, the prospecting licensee has to \nsubmit PRs25,000 as security, PRs1,000 as a map fee, PRs20,000 for pillars \nmarking the boundary, and dead rent at PRs15 per acre.18 These amounts are \ndeposited in the bank through a challan (deposit slip). \n \n(ii)  Mining leases. Once the prospector has proven the existence of reserves, the \nprospecting license can be converted into a mining lease after completion of \n                                                 \n17 This is equivalent to 100\u2013200  acres. \n18 A dead rent is the rent that is paid whether or not minerals are being extracted. \n ", "                                                                                 Appendix 3  49\nformalities. Upon starting production, the licensee has to apply to obtain rahdari \nto allow depositing royalty and transporting minerals. 19  \n \nc.  Procedure for Collection of Mineral Revenues \n \n47.  The MMD used to print separate rahdari books for each mine owner. These were serially \npre-numbered, stamped, and signed by the department. Each rahdari had three copies. The first \ncopy (red) was required to be submitted to the check points. This information was entered in a \nregister separately for each mine owner. The second copy (green) was to remain with the truck \nduring transportation, while the third copy (white) was for the record. The copies were colored \nso that they could not be photocopied and misused. This system continued from 1995 to 2001. \nLater, the printing of these rahdari books by the department was discontinued, and now the \nmine owners get these books printed and pre-numbered. All three copies are white, but the \nsame system is being followed. \n \n48.  The province has 10 check points for checking mineral transportation, and each sends a \nmonthly return (showing minerals produced by each licensee) to the head office in Quetta. The \nlicensees deposit royalties every 6 months based on minerals produced and transported during \nthat period. The quantity for which royalties have been deposited could be counterchecked \nagainst the monthly statements provided by the check point, or with the register kept at the \ncheck  points.  The  amount  deposited  by  the  licensees  in  the  bank  through  challan  is \ncounterchecked with the detail of deposits provided by the bank. In addition to the check points, \nchecking squads are also employed to check whether the truck transporting minerals has a \nrahdari. \n \n49.  Since FY2007, the province has been divided into eight blocks according to mineral \ndistricts, and collection of royalties has been privatized in more than half the blocks. The \nrevenue sources whose collection was privatized were generating about PRs30 million per year \nand the same amount was fixed as the official minimum acceptable bid. The open auction \nresulted in a high bid of PRs44 million. The bid is still awaiting official acceptance, which would \nallow it to be converted into a revenue-collection contract. \n \n50.  Revenue collection from sand and crush rocks at Hub is privatized. The collection has \nincreased from PRs4 million to more than PRs10 million in 2 years. The latest auction was for \nPRs22 million. However, after finalization of the contract, one of the bidders who was not among \nthe three highest challenged the award in court and MMD canceled the contract award. \n \nd.  Royalty Rates \n \n51.  In May 2006, the royalty rates (rupees per ton) were substantially increased, but were \nreduced later in response to protests from the mining sector. Even so, rates are much higher \nnow than in 2005. Revenues have increased from PRs353 million in FY2007 to an estimated \nPRs500 in FY2008. Saindak (about PRs300 million), Chamalan Coal Mines (PRs30 million), \nand Onyx Mines of Zehri brothers (PRs10 million) contribute the most in royalties. When Reko \nDiq starts production at the end of 2008, it will contribute almost PRs2 billion per year as royalty. \nDuddar, which is expected to start production in the next 2 months, will contribute an additional \nPRs300 million. \n \n                                                 \n19  Rahdari is a form of permission to transport the minerals from mines. \n ", "50   Appendix 3 \n52.  Major increases in royalties are expected after 2010\u20132012. Large concessions that are \ncurrently  being  explored  are  expected  to  be  in  production  after  2010.  These  include  five \ncompanies that are prospecting for copper and gold in Chaghi, and two that are prospecting for \niron ore. The companies are from the United Kingdom (two), Pakistan (two), Canada, Australia, \nand United Arab Emirates. \n \n3.  Governing and Related Institutions  \n \n    a.   Mines and Minerals Department \n \n53.  The  GOB  created  the  MMD  in  March  2002  to  facilitate  exploration  and  production \nactivities. The main functions of MMD include the following: \n \n(i)  application of the Balochistan Minerals Rules 2002, \n(ii)  grant of mineral concessions, \n(iii)  collection of royalty and the resolution of boundary disputes,  \n(iv)  implementation of development projects in the mines and minerals sector, and \n(v)  technical assistance to mine owners as and when needed. \n \n54.  The MMD is administratively organized into three sections, which deal respectively with \nconcessions, exploration, and administration. The concessions section is responsible for issuing \nfour types of mining licenses, as provided for in the NMP. The exploration section is responsible \nfor  delivering  marketing  support  for  priority  minerals.  The  administration  and  coordination \nsection is responsible for day-to-day administration. \n \n55.  The MMD has three technical wings: the Directorate General of Mines and Minerals, \nInspectorate of Mines, and Mines Labor Welfare Organization. \n  \n56.  The Directorate General of Mines and Minerals is responsible for granting concessions, \nenforcing the Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, collecting royalties, and resolving disputes \nin addition to providing technical advice, if required, to mine owners. The directorate is also \nresponsible for carrying out any development projects for which the Department of Mines and \nMinerals is the implementing agency. The directorate is headed by a director general, who is \nqualified as a mining engineer. The directorate has regional offices at Hub and Loralai, but the \nentire process of granting of concessions is centralized with the director general and has to be \ncompleted in Quetta. \n \n57.  The Inspectorate of Mines is responsible for the enforcement of relevant safety laws in \nmining operations.20 The inspectorate consists of an inspection wing, which is responsible for \nperiodic inspection of mines; and a mine rescue and safety wing, which is responsible for \nproviding emergency services and supervising rescue operations, if required, and conducting \nmine safety training programs for supervisory staff of mines.  \n \n58.  The Mines Labor Welfare Organization is responsible for the administration of welfare \nprograms for mine workers. It collects excise duty under the Excise Duty on Minerals (Labour \nWelfare) Act, 1967, on rates fixed by the federal Government, and uses the proceeds to fund \nwelfare facilities for mine workers. The organization is running 3 high schools, 6 middle schools, \n                                                 \n20 These laws include the Mines Act, 1923; Coal Mines Regulation, 1926; Metaliferous Mines Regulations, 1926; \nConsolidated Mines Rules 1952; and the Electricity Rules 1937. \n ", "                                                                                 Appendix 3  51\nand 11 primary schools for free education of mine workers\u2019 children; a 25-bed hospital and 15 \ndispensaries; and recreation facilities.  \n \n59.  According to the NMP, a Mineral Investment Facilitation Authority was to be established \nin Balochistan, with the MMD serving as the secretariat. The authority has not been established. \nThe  NMP  provides  for  such  authorities  in  each  province,  each  of  which  would  have \nresponsibility for monitoring and regulatory review of public sector mineral activities, reviewing \nthe  progress  in  granting  concessions,  introducing  capacity  development  programs  for  the \nsector,  and  encouraging  private  sector  investment  in  the  mining  industry.  Some  of  these \nenvisioned activities would overlap with existing responsibilities of the three wings of the MMD. \n \nb.  Government Corporations Involved in the Minerals Sector \n \n60.  Mining is a provincial subject, but the MMD receives support on policy and planning \nissues from the mineral wing of the Federal Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources. Other \nfederal agencies providing technical support include the Geological Survey of Pakistan, which \nundertakes geological mapping all over the country; and the Pakistan Mineral Development \nCorporation, which explores, plans, develops, and operates mining ventures in Pakistan, often \nin collaboration with national and international public and private sector partners.   \n \n61.  In addition, the Balochistan Development Authority is involved in the development of \nmineral resources of the province. Established in 1974, it is a semiautonomous body working \nunder the P&DD. The organization has the authority to plan, promote, organize, and implement \nprojects in the minerals sector. Currently, the organization has entered into two joint venture \npartnerships  for  mineral  exploration  with  foreign  companies,  including  the  exploration  and \nmining of copper and gold deposits in Reko Diq, and the exploration and mining of lead in the \nDuddar mines of Lasbela.  \n \n4.   Current Allocation of Mineral Exploration and Mining Rights: Large- and \nSmall-Scale Mining  \n \n62.  Areas smaller than 4.05 square kilometers are termed small concessions in Balochistan, \nwhile  others  are  considered  large  concessions.  Currently,  the  province  has  28  large \nconcessions at various stages of mining and exploration. In general, mining in Balochistan is \ncharacterized by the proliferation of small-scale operations.  \n \n63.  As of 30 June 2006, the GOB had granted 697 prospecting licenses and 384 mining \nleases for a total of 1,081 concessions for the exploration of 41 minerals. By 31 May 2008, the \nnumber of concessions had increased to 1,237. The largest number of leases is for coal \nmining\u2014147 prospecting and 221 mining leases for coal had been granted as of June 2006. \nThe number of leases for the exploration of onyx and marble is also significant\u201483 prospecting \nand 29 mining leases for onyx, and 174 prospecting and 34 mining leases for marble. The \ngovernment also granted 54 prospecting and mining leases for granite, and 65 leases for \nprospecting and mining of limestone.  \n \n \n ", "52   Appendix 4 \nSTATUS OF PENDING CONDITIONS UNDER  \nTHE FIRST BALOCHISTAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \n \n1.  It is expected that by loan effectiveness, the government of Balochistan (GOB) will have \ncompleted  all  agreed  actions  for  four  outstanding  conditions  under  the  first  Balochistan \nResource Management Program (BRMP I). On the provincial finance commission (PFC) award \ntranche condition (item (i) in Table A4), the government approved the 3-year PFC award, \nalthough delayed by a year, in 2006; and some district governments used savings from the PFC \nawards  for  development  expenditures.  Hence,  the  substance  required  under  this  tranche \ncondition has been satisfied. The GOB has moved forward in rationalizing the Public Sector \nDevelopment Program (PSDP) with the full cost review of all incomplete schemes and the \nexpected reduction in throw forward, excluding mega projects, to 2.5 years in FY2009 (item \n(ii) in Table A4). The overlapping of mandates in devolved schemes has been significantly \nreduced, but cannot be fully eliminated in Balochistan or in the rest of Pakistan. It is expected \nthat the study on contingent liabilities will be completed by December 2008 (item (iii) in Table \nA4). The private sector strategy will be finalized by December 2008 (item (iv) in Table A4). \n \n2.  Progress has been made toward complying with three conditions in which most agreed \nactions  will  be  completed  by  loan  effectiveness.  Advanced  progress  has  been  made  with \nrespect to enhancement of revenue yields (item (v) in Table A4). The action plan on Abiana \nrecovery is expected to be completed by February 2009.1 However, the third party assessment \nof the property tax registers cannot be undertaken because the regular 5-year property survey \nof the GOB will be completed only by June 2009. The government has prepared the draft \nprocurement law (item (vi) in Table A4) and will submit it to the Provincial Assembly by loan \neffectiveness. Implementing rules will be subsequently issued. However, procurement manuals \nwill take time to prepare and approve. The mountain valley management plans will be finalized \nby December 2008, but their adoption will take more time (item (vii) in Table A4). \n \n3.  The two remaining conditions will not be met during implementation of subprogram 1 of \nBRMP II because of changes in policy direction and time constraints. The agreed action to \nstrengthen local institutional capacity for training (item (viii) in Table A4), which was to be done \nthrough the grant of autonomy to the Rural Development Academy, is no longer possible \nbecause of a change in policy direction. With the lack of basic capacity within the academy to \nconduct training, the GOB does not believe that granting autonomy to the academy will have a \nsignificant  impact  in  developing  local  government  capacity.  In  terms  of  operation  and \nmaintenance  yardsticks  (item  (ix)  in  Table  A4),  those  developed  for  the  road sector  were \ndeemed to be of poor quality as they did not comply with the communication and works manual, \nand yielded unrealistic budget estimates when applied. Consequently, the GOB did not accept \nthem. Therefore, pushing for the implementation of such yardsticks is not possible unless \nanother review is undertaken. New TA support can be considered to support a new diagnostic \nstudy. \n \n4.  In addition to the second-tranche release conditions that were not fully complied with, \nthe program progress report raised concern over the increase in the property tax exemption for \nself-occupied  properties  from  139.35  square  meters  (1,500  square  feet)  to  464.52  square \nmeters (5,000 square feet). Lowering the exemption at this time would not be possible because \nthis requires the promulgation of an act but given the economic situation in Pakistan and \ncalamity in Balochistan, persuading the majority of the huge coalition government to take such \naction would be difficult. Nonetheless, foregone revenue arising from the higher exemption has \nnot been significant (para. 10 in the main text of the RRP). \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Abiana refers to the user charges collected by the GOB on utilization of water from canals for irrigation purposes. \n ", "Appendix 4  53 \nTable A4: Substantially and Partially Complied With Second Tranche Conditions of BRMP I \n \nCompliance \n  Status During   \n  Tranche   \n  Release   Mission Findings on Pending Agreed Actions \nTranche Condition  (April 2007)  (November 2008) \n(i) Announced PFC award  Substantially  Fully complied.

Need for Better Service Delivery in Key Social Sectors \n \n1.  Balochistan\u2019s  unique  geography  does  not  lend  itself  to  models  of  service  provision \nprevalent in more densely populated areas of the country. For example, almost all the attempts \nto provide relatively sophisticated services on a permanent basis at primary care health facilities \nhave been futile. Similarly, efforts at providing secondary and higher school facilities in areas \nnot well serviced by public transport are not likely to succeed.  \n \n2.  Weak  Capacity  in  Local  Governments.  The  Devolution  Plan  of  2000  introduces \nextensive administrative and fiscal restructuring, as well as revisions to rules, regulations, and \nlegislation.  It  also  places  considerable  demands  on  local  government  staff,  who  have \ntraditionally had little exposure to financial management or decision making, and who typically \ndo not have the required level of technical expertise. These problems are particularly acute in \nBalochistan because of its low level of human resource development, as well as its hierarchical \nsocial structure, which discourages innovation and initiative. \n \n3.  Lack  of  Coordination  in  Training  Programs.  The  lack  of  coordination  of  training \nprograms in the province hampers human resource development. For instance, the Human \nResource Development Directorate of the Health Department is the focal point for training \nactivities in the health sector. However, the Health Department, nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs),  and  district  governments  conduct  training  without  the  knowledge  of  the  Human \nResource Development Directorate. An integrated database has not been set up. Consequently, \ntraining programs overlap and scarce resources are wasted. \n \n4.  Funding Constraints Faced by District Governments. District governments, which \ndepend heavily on the transfers from the provincial government, provide basic education and \nhealth services. Each district\u2019s allocation is based on current expenditure parameters. Transfers \ntend to be limited by the fiscal constraints faced by the GOB. Some district governments are \nable to save on these one-line transfers, and fund development schemes. In general, however, \nthe available funding is insufficient to finance significant improvements in the delivery of social \nservices. The GOB implements health and education development schemes that cover multiple \ndistricts  or  receive  foreign  assistance.  Attempts  at  compensating  this  shortfall  through \nperformance grants have also faced challenges. Access conditions for performance grants are \nfairly stringent, and district administrations seldom meet all the requirements. In cases where \nthe conditions are met on paper, there is little guarantee that they will be implemented in \npractice. \n \nB.  Reforms to Strengthen Social Service Delivery \n \n5.  Depending  on  the  outcomes  of  the  Balochistan  Devolved  Social  Services  Program \n(BDSSP), subprogram 2 of BRMP II may provide continuity in reforms. The ongoing BDSSP \naims to improve service delivery through the following key reform areas: (i) provincial efficiency, \n(ii) managerial power, (iii) citizens\u2019 voice and empowerment, and (iv) private sector engagement. \nPossible follow up actions may aim to improve service delivery in the education and health \nsectors  by  (i)  improving  coordination  of  human  resource  development,  (ii)  improving  and \nexpanding the quantitative service delivery survey (QSDS), (iii) developing guidelines for public\u2013\nprivate  partnership  contracts,  and  (iv)  providing  incentives  for  implementing  non-salary \nexpenditure allocation norms. \n \n ", "Appendix 7  67 \n1.  Improve Human Resource Development Coordination in Education and \nHealth \n \n6.  The quality of social sector service delivery depends heavily on the capacity of front-end \nservice providers, who need regular in-service training opportunities to keep their skills current. \nBDSSP has strengthened the framework for improving the quality of social services and the \nmanagerial capacity of district and facility managers. Building on the human resource action \nplans developed under BDSSP, future reforms may focus on human resource development \ncoordination. The Health Department can review departmental mechanisms for coordinating all \ntraining in respective sectors. The review should also identify training needs, both in terms of \nexpertise and region; and groups in different districts should be invited to participate. The Health \nDepartment can designate a unit to coordinate the training programs. A functional database can \nbe developed, which classifies training by duration, skills imparted, region, number and level of \npersonnel  trained,  and  any  other  parameters  that  the  Health  Department  may  consider \nnecessary. This will reduce the duplication of training offered to government staff. \n \n2.  Refine and Expand the Quantitative Service Delivery Survey \n \n7.  The absence of comprehensive monitoring remains a weak link in the chain of social \nservice delivery, and precludes meaningful improvements in services for end users. BDSSP has \ndeveloped the QSDS  and citizen report cards, through which citizens\u2019 demands for social \nservices can be heard. Pilot surveys are to be conducted under BDSSP, and findings will \nprovide feedback to guide policy direction for provincial and district governments. A possible \nfuture reform action is the refinement and expansion of the QSDS to at least 15 districts. The \nrollout  of  the  QSDS  is  expected  to  strengthen  monitoring  of  service  delivery,  as  well  as \ninstitutionalize the feedback mechanism from civil society.  \n \n3.  Facilitate Private Sector Participation in Service Delivery \n \n8.  Public sector resources are insufficient to meet service delivery needs in the province. \nAs  such,  private  and  nonprofit  institutions  must  be  involved  in  delivering  basic  services. \nDeveloping private sector participation in service delivery is a key reform area under BDSSP. A \nfollow up program to BDSSP may help the GOB expand private sector participation. Guidelines \nfor  developing  public\u2013private  partnership  contracts  may  be  developed  to  facilitate  and \nencourage  the  GOB  in  identifying  and  engaging  with  potential  sources  of  private  sector \nparticipation, which will increase the efficiency of service delivery and offset the cost. The \nguidelines can include details on the types of partnerships that may be pursued (management \ncontracts, outsourcing of some services, build-own-operate-transfer schemes), prototypes of \ncontracts, and details on examples of how such partnerships operate in other parts of the \ncountry.  \n  \n4.  Offer Incentives to Use Expenditure Allocation Norms in Line with Minimum \nService Delivery Standards \n \n9.  To improve the predictability and adequacy of social sector funding in line with agreed \nupon minimum service delivery standards, expenditure allocation norms were prepared for the \nfirst  tranche  release  of  BDSSP,  and  these  are  expected  to  be  approved  by  the  Finance \nDepartment for release of the second tranche. Future reform actions may be needed to help the \nGOB  introduce  performance  grants  to  district  governments  as  an  incentive  for  using  the \nexpenditure allocation norms in their budgets. \n ", " 68  Appendix 8 \nLIST OF INELIGIBLE ITEMS \n  No withdrawals shall be made for the following: \n \n(i)  expenditures for goods included in the following groups or subgroups of the \nUnited Nations Standard International Trade Classification, Revision 3 (SITC, \nRev. 3), or any successor groups or subgroups under future revisions in the \nSITC, as designated by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to the Borrower: \n \nTable A8: Ineligible Items \n \nChapter  Heading  Description of Items \n112    Alcoholic beverages \n121    Tobacco, unmanufactured; tobacco refuse \n122    Tobacco, manufactured (whether or not containing tobacco \nsubstitute \n525    Radioactive and associated materials \n667    Pearls, precious and semiprecious stones, unworked or \nworked \n718  718.7  Nuclear reactors, and parts thereof, fuel elements (cartridges), \nnonirradiated for nuclear reactors \n728  728.43  Tobacco processing machinery \n897  897.3  Jewelry of gold, silver, or platinum-group metals (except \nwatches and watch cases) and goldsmiths\u2019 or silversmiths\u2019 \nwares (including set gems) \n971    Gold, nonmonetary (excluding gold ore and concentrates) \nSource: United Nations. \n \n(ii)  expenditures in the currency of the Borrower or of goods supplied from the \nterritory of the Borrower;  \n \n(iii)  expenditures  for  goods  supplied  under  a  contract  that  any  national  or \ninternational financing institution or agency will have financed or has agreed to \nfinance, including any contract financed under any ADB loan;  \n \n(iv)  expenditures for goods intended for a military or paramilitary purpose or for \nluxury consumption;  \n \n(v)  expenditures for narcotics;  \n \n(vi)  expenditures  for  environmentally  hazardous  goods,  the  manufacture,  use,  or \nimport of which is prohibited under the laws of the Borrower or international \nagreements to which the Borrower is a party; and \n \n(vii)  expenditures  on  account  of  any  payment  prohibited  by  the  Borrower  in \ncompliance with a decision of the United Nations Security Council taken under \nChapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.  \n  \n ", "Appendix 9  69 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR SUPPORTING  \nTHE SECOND BALOCHISTAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nIn 2004, the government of Balochistan (GOB) released the Balochistan poverty reduction strategy paper (B-PRSP), \nwhich identifies inclusive growth as the main strategy for reducing poverty in the province. It is underpinned by five \npillars: engendering growth, managing the scarce water resources, achieving governance reforms, improving human \ndevelopment, and addressing vulnerability to shocks. Based on data from the mid-1990s to 2001, the B-PRSP \nindicates that poverty in Balochistan is severe, due in large part to the interaction of social (including political), \neconomic, and environmental factors. Social indicators, including literacy, life expectancy, and health activities, \nreportedly are among the lowest in the world. Economic challenges arise from the lack of economic activity, investment \nand capital accumulation, compounded by poor governance and weak coordination across and between levels of \ngovernment. Furthermore, Balochistan covers 347,000 square kilometers with limited fertile land and water resources, \nand an extremely low population density, making the province a challenging environment for service delivery.  \n \nThe country strategy and program update for Pakistan 2006\u20132008a indicates that assistance will be provided to \nconsolidate improvements in performance in the social sectors through province-based support for social sectors and \nprovincial resource management programs. In this respect, the Second Balochistan Resource Management Program \n(BRMP  II)  is aligned  with  the  country  strategy  and  program  update  and  earlier  programs  related  to  resource \nmanagement and service delivery. BRMP and the Balochistan Devolved Social Services Program (BDSSP) aimed to \nassist the province with its strategy of inclusive growth to reduce poverty. The BRMP aimed to reform public finances \nand financial management by introducing poverty-related criteria in the allocation of development expenditures and the \nPublic Sector Development Program. BRMP also aimed to reform social services, particularly in the health sector. \nBDSSP aimed to assist Balochistan\u2019s progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in health, education, \nand water supply and sanitation (WSS) by (i) increasing access to affordable, effective, and quality social services in \nthe public and private sectors; (ii) reducing disparities in access; and (iii) strengthening local governments, private \nsector, and communities in providing services. BRMP II continues with reforms initiated under these programs; its \nobjective is to remove growth impediments and improve fiscal resource mobilization. The resulting improvements in \nresource flows will then promote further improvements in social service delivery. The three core policy objectives of \nBRMP II are (i) improve public financial management, (ii) develop an affordable and sustainable pension and employee \nbenefit system, and (iii) enhance government\u2019s role as facilitator of minerals sector growth. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                              Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1. Key Issues \n \nAccording to primary data from Pakistan\u2019s household surveys of 1998\u20131999, 2001\u20132002, and 2004\u20132005, the \nincidence, intensity, and severity of poverty have increased considerably in Balochistan.b The incidence of poverty in \nthe province rose from 21.6% in 1998\u20131999 to 33.1% in 2004\u20132005. The worsening situation in rural areas accounted \nfor the overall increase in the province; urban poverty levels remained stagnant. Although the increase in poverty from \n1998\u20131999 to 2001\u20132002 may be attributed to the severe drought that increased poverty across all provinces, poverty \ncontinued to rise over the subsequent 3 years. While statistics on the incidence of poverty are not yet available beyond \n2004\u20132005, some social sector statistics related to the MDGs seem to indicate improvement since 2004. According to \nthe Pakistan social and living standards measurement survey (PSLM), which monitors the implementation of the MDGs \nand PRSP, education statistics have improved. Literacy increased from 37% in 2004\u20132005 to 42% in 2006\u20132007, while \nthe gross enrollment rate at the primary level rose from 65% in to 70% in that period. PSLM statistics for the health \nsector indicate an increase in immunization rates among children, and a larger percentage of children received \ntreatment for diarrhea. The rate of prenatal and postnatal consultations also increased.  \n \n2. Design Features \n \nBRMP II seeks to strengthen the link between the development budget and poverty and economic strategies by \nensuring that the GOB adopts the B-PRSP II as a medium-term economic development strategy, and that the Public \n ", " 76  Appendix 10 \nSector Development Program is aligned with this strategy. It will also include the improvement and expansion of the \npublic expenditure tracking survey to more districts. \nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \n \n1.  Better resource mobilization and allocation, as well as internal controls by the GOB, will result in more \ngovernment efficiency. This will result in more effective services available to the public. \n \n2.  The program has no adverse impact on vulnerable groups. \n \n3.  By improving public financial management (revenue generation, better expenditure management, and stronger \ninternal controls), BRMP II creates more fiscal space that can be used for pro-poor expenditures. BRMP II also \naims to make pension payments off budget and fully funded by separate financially viable and sustainable \npension and general provident funds. These also will address fiscal problems posed pension liabilities, creating \nadditional resources for pro-poor spending. By facilitating more private sector involvement in the minerals \nsector, employment is generated around mining concessions. A well-designed contract also will support benefit-\nsharing programs that will result in gains by communities around those concessions, while ensuring that the \nproper environment and labor safeguards are put in place. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nBRMP II is intended to address government inefficiencies arising from weak public financial management. As such, \nspecific beneficiaries are not targeted. Reform under the program is expected to benefit the public, including the poor \nand vulnerable. One area that may have a social impact is addressing the weak financial position of the GOB, which \nresults in insufficient resources to fund social expenditures. Ministry of Finance data on PRSP expenditures for FY2007 \nshow that education accounted for 6.7% of total spending, while health accounted for 21%\u2014both are the lowest among \nall Pakistan\u2019s provinces. By improving resource mobilization and allocation, and complementing these with better \ninternal expenditure controls, financial flows can effectively benefit the public. The GOB will be able to fully utilized its \nresources, and allocate them in a way that is more responsive to citizens\u2019 needs. In addition to these reforms, the \nGovernment will be encouraged, through policy dialogue, to target the most deprived districts in the allocation of \ncounterpart funds generated from the loan proceeds through the performance grant mechanism. The GOB and ADB \ndiscussed the possibility of expanding the scope of subprogram 2 of BRMP II to cover reforms on social service \ndelivery to provide continuity to BDSSP. However, this will depend on the outcomes of BDSSP. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  During  program  preparation,  extensive  consultations  were  conducted  with  the  GOB    including,  Balochistan \nDevelopment  Authority,  Balochistan  Health  Foundation,  Board  of  Revenue,  Education  Department,  Excise  and \nTaxation Department, Finance Department, Local Government Department, Health Department, Irrigation and Power \nDepartment,  Mines  and  Minerals  Department,  Planning  and  Development  Department,  and  selected  district \ngovernments. Meetings with private mining companies were also conducted to gather private sector views on minerals \nsector development. Meetings also were held with other development partners (World Bank and Department for \nInternational Development of the United Kingdom) to ensure development partner coordination. \n \nDiscussions on service delivery issues, such as human resource development, financial flows to the health and \neducation  sectors,  weaknesses  in  service  delivery  mechanisms,  were  undertaken  with  the  Balochistan  Health \nFoundation,  Education  Department,  Finance  Department,  Health  Department,  and  Planning  and  Development \nDepartment to identify problems and possible solutions. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n Information sharing      Consultation     Collaborative decision making     Empowerment \n \n3. Was a consultation and participation plan prepared?   Yes    No  \n \nA formal consultation and participation plan was not prepared because the program preparation is straightforward and \nwill only necessitate meetings with key government departments. A list of key agencies to be consulted is drawn up \nbefore loan processing missions.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 10     77 \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues. \n \nBRMP II has no specific gender implications. The GOB intends to use part of the counterpart funds generated from \nproceeds of the Asian Development Fund loan for development spending channeled through performance grants. In \nthe past, the GOB had used the performance grants to provide girls with access to primary education. \n2.
