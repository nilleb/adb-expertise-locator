Nine \nsubprojects have been selected for the first financing tranche. The \nenergy savings will result from retrofitting existing equipment with \nmore efficient equipment, which in aggregate will reduce the need \nto construct and operate a conventional coal-fired power plant. \nThe Investment Program requires designing a suitable EPP model \nas a pilot in Guangdong that can be scaled up and replicated in \nother  high  energy  consuming  provinces.  An  EPP  can  be \ndeveloped  at  about  half  the  cost  of  a  coal-fired  power  plant. \nEnergy savings from an EPP have multiple benefits: (i) energy \nsecurity improves as lesser new power supply capacity will be \nneeded to meet future demand, and less coal will be used for \npower generation; and (ii) the local and subregional environment \nimproves, and the contribution to global climate change is lower \nbecause of avoided coal use. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  consider  only  retrofits  of  proven \nenergy efficiency technologies in the following areas: (i) motors \nand  motor-drive  systems;  (ii)  transformers  and  reactive  power \ncompensators;  (iii)  lighting;  (iv)  heating,  ventilation,  and  air \nconditioning;  (v)  air  compressors  and  pumping  systems; \n(vi) recovery of waste energy from industry; (vii) industrial boilers \nand  industrial  cogeneration;  and  (viii)  other  related  energy \nefficiency improvement projects. \n \n   ", "ii   \n \nMultitranche Financing  The success of the pilot EPP Investment Program will depend on \nFacility  how quickly barriers can be lowered and necessary investments \nare made by end users. A multitranche financing facility (MFF) is \nproposed to enable Guangdong provincial government (GPG) to \nincrease awareness of EPP, select appropriate EPP subprojects, \nand  systematically  expand  and  implement  the  Investment \nProgram. Since this is the first EPP project for both the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and GPG, a phased implementation is \nplanned  under  successive  tranche  loans  of  the  MFF.  While \nimplementation of subprojects under tranche 1 is in progress, the \nEPP-Project  Management  Office  (EPP-PMO)  will  seek \napplications from other high impact subborrowers with potential \nfor  higher  energy  savings.  The  experience  gained  during  the \nselection and design of subprojects in tranche 1 will be used to \nsolicit applications from other types of subborrowers (e.g., budget-\nfunded institutions like schools and hospitals) and improve the \ndesign of subsequent subprojects. \n \nReadily available debt is often the key barrier for energy users \nwanting to use energy efficiency technologies for retrofitting; this \nis the case in Guangdong. Such investments are different from \ntraditional infrastructure project financing, as (i) retrofits involve \nnumerous  relatively  small  investments  (subprojects)  with  short \nimplementation periods of a few months; (ii) end users do not \nexpand production or develop new products, i.e., no additional \nrevenue; (iii) commercial banks lack the understanding of energy \nefficiency technologies and benefits; and (iv) the payback period \nof  subprojects  is  shorter  (generally  less  than  5  years).  In \nconsideration of these characteristics, use of the FIL modality is \nproposed,  with  simplified  subproject  approval,  strengthened \nimplementation supervision, and the required flexibility to GPG for \nquicker turnaround of EPP activities. Given the numerous small \nsubprojects,  ADB\u2019s  direct  supervision  of  procurement, \ndisbursement,  and  subproject  approval  will  not  be  necessary \nunder the FIL modality. Further, a FIL will allow ADB loan funds to \nbe rolled over for new subprojects as each batch of subloans is \nrepaid, thus creating additional energy savings.  \n   \nRationale  Currently, the PRC has the second largest energy demand in the \nworld; it is projected to become the largest energy consumer soon \nafter 2010. Approximately, 63% of the primary energy demand is \nmet  by  coal,  and  82%  of  electricity  is  generated  from  coal. \nAlthough  the  country  has  traditionally  been  self-sufficient  in \nenergy, the massive increase in internal demand has resulted in \nincreased reliance on imported energy. \n \n ", "  iii\n  The high share of coal-fired power generation results in serious \nenvironmental issues and accounts for about 50% of the PRC\u2019s \nsulfur dioxide emissions and 80% of nitrogen oxide emissions\u2014\nboth pollutants result in acid rain that falls on one third of the \ncountry. Approximately, 48% of cities fail to meet the national air \nquality  standards.  Carbon  dioxide emissions  from  power \n \ngeneration account for 26% of the greenhouse gas emitted from \nthe PRC. The PRC currently accounts for 5.1% of global carbon \nemissions; this is estimated to increase to 28% by 2030. Rapid \nimplementation  of  energy  conservation  measures,  including \nimplementation of EPPs, will lower the burden for later addressing \nthe consequence of carbon emission and climate change. \n \nGuangdong has the largest and fastest-growing economy among \nall  the  PRC  provinces;  its  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  has \ngrown at 14% per annum since 1995. Electricity consumption is \ndominated by energy-intensive heavy industries, with the industry \nand manufacturing sectors combined representing about 73% of \ntotal electricity use. The total installed power generation capacity \nwas  59.3  gigawatts  in  2007.  The  province  has  relatively  low \nnatural  resource  endowments.  It  imports  100%  of  coal \nrequirements  and  80%  of  oil  needs;  approximately  20%  of \nelectricity is imported from other provinces. The demand for power \nhas  outpaced  supply  and  power  shortages  have  been \nexperienced during the summer peak periods. More than 75% of \nthe  generation  capacity  is  from  coal-fired  power  plants,  which \nhave  caused  serious  air  pollution.  The  energy  intensity  of \nGuangdong\u2019s  economy  is  relatively  low  compared  with  other \nprovinces  in  the  PRC,  however,  it  is  high  by  international \nstandards\u2014about 3.4 times the average of member countries of \nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in \n2006. Improving energy efficiency is a high priority for GPG to \nhelp  address  both  energy  security  and  environmental  issues. \nGuangdong also provides a good setting to pilot the EPP model \nbecause of its vibrant economy and the large impact that energy \nsavings will have in comparison with less industrialized provinces. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Investment Program will be improved energy \nsecurity  and  environmental  conditions  in  Guangdong.  The \noutcome will be improved energy efficiency in the industry and \ncommercial sectors. The outputs will be (i) establishment of an on-\nlending  model  that  will  enable  an  EPP  to  be  developed  with \nannual 532 gigawatt-hours of energy savings and an equivalent \n107 megawatt capacity, (ii) development of the energy service \ncompany sector in Guangdong, (iii) development of capacity for \nthe promotion and assessment of energy efficiency projects, and \n(iv) replication of the EPP model in other provinces. \n   \n ", "iv   \n \nInvestment Plan   The cost of the Investment Program is estimated at $142 million.  \n \n  ($ million) \nItem           Cost \nA.

The financing will be subject to interest to be determined \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility,  the  applicable  commitment  charge,  and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the related loan and \nproject agreements. The Government has the flexibility to choose \nbetween  eligible  currencies  and  interest  rate  regimes  most \nsuitable  for  each  loan.  ADB  provides  flexibility  in  terms  of \nrepayment and interest rate swaps during the financing period in \naccordance  with  the  framework  financing  agreement,  relevant \nloan  regulations,  and  draft  loan  and  project  agreements. \nRepayment schedules can be structured in line with the specific \nneeds of individual loans. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  made  available  by  the \nTerms  Government  to  GPG,  and  then  onlent  in  yuan  (CNY)  to  EPP \nsubborrowers through subloan agreements. The onlending will be \nexecuted  through  Guangdong  Finance  Trust  Company  Limited \n(GFTC),  a  trust  company  acting  as  the  financial  intermediary. \nGPG will bear the foreign exchange risk. \n ", "  v\n   \nRetroactive Financing  Retroactive financing may be possible under individual loans for \nexpenditures  incurred  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the \ncorresponding loan agreements, with a ceiling of up to 20% of the \nloan amount, in accordance with Cost Sharing and Eligibility of \nExpenditures  for  Asian  Development  Bank  Financing:  A  New \nApproach.  The  Government  and  GPG  were  informed  that \napproval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does \nnot commit ADB to finance any of the proposed subprojects.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  The last financing tranche should be executed by 30 June 2010 \nand disbursed by 31 December 2012. Each loan may be onlent to \nnew subborrowers as subloans are repaid until the ADB loans are \nrepaid in full. \n   \nExecuting Agency and  GPG  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  overall \nImplementation  implementation of the Investment Program. GPG has established \nArrangements  the EPP-PMO to implement the EPP; GFTC will be the financial \nintermediary  to  onlend  to  subborrowers.  The  EPP  Steering \nCommittee will provide policy direction and operating guidance, \nand approve subloans. If GFTC and the EPP-PMO have differing \nopinions on the qualification of subloan applications, the steering \ncommittee  will make the final decision. The EPP-PMO will be \nresponsible for (i) marketing and promoting EPP; (ii) reviewing \nand  assessing  EPP  subproject  applications  based  on  the \nselection  criteria  and  approval  process  for  subprojects;  (iii) \noverseeing  implementation  of  subprojects;  (iv)  measuring  and \nverifying energy savings of completed subprojects; and (v) overall \nmonitoring, managing, and reporting for the Investment Program. \nThird party consultants may be hired to (i) perform independent \nmeasurement and evaluation of EPP energy savings, (ii) assist in \nsupervising subproject implementation, and (iii) help with clean \ndevelopment mechanism document preparation and verification \nactivities. \n \nGFTC will be responsible for (i) assessing the financial capacity of \nsubborrowers  and  financial  viability  of  the  subprojects, \n(ii)  disbursing  funds  and  administering  the  subloan  portfolio, \n(iii) managing the trust account, (iv) managing subloan collaterals \nand  guarantees,  (v)  taking  necessary  action  against \nnonperforming  loans,  and  (vi)  ensuring  that  the  accounts  are \naudited yearly. \n \n ", "vi   \n \n  The Investment Program design is innovative, wherein onlending \nis through a financial intermediary and implementation of EPP \nsubprojects  is  overseen  by  the  EPP-PMO.  The  approach \nconsiders sustainability and replicability of the EPP model, and \ntakes into account the current barriers of the energy efficiency \nmarket in Guangdong. Successful EPP implementation requires \neffective  management  of  financial  and  project  aspects; \ninvolvement  of  GFTC  and  EPP-PMO  addresses  both  these \nrequirements and their strengths are complementary. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). Subborrowers will be required to \nfollow  relevant  procurement  rules  in  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  for  financial  intermediary  and  adopt  appropriate \nprocurement procedures which will include (i) reasonable prices, \nand  (ii)  fair  canvassing  when  selecting  suppliers.  Procurement \nmust  be  from  ADB  member  countries.  Subborrowers  will  be \nencouraged to procure goods through competitive bidding and \nshopping when such procedures are applicable in the interest of \neconomy and efficiency. In case of noncompliance, GFTC will \nexercise the right to recall the subloan. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The environmental assessment and review framework concludes \nBeneficiaries  that  the  Investment  Program  will  provide  an  overall  benefit  to \nenvironmental conditions in Guangdong. Regional air quality will \nimprove and greenhouse gas emissions will be lowered as the \nneed  for  coal-fired  power  generation  will  be  reduced.  The \nenvironmental  benefits  include  the  reduction  of  coal  use  by \n175,813  tons/year  (t/y);  and  the  reduction  of  emission  of  total \nsuspended particulates by 1,785 t/y, sulfur dioxide by 4,795 t/y; \nnitrogen oxide by 1,066 t/y, and carbon dioxide by 415,560 t/y. \n \nBased  on  a  methodology  in  ADB\u2019s  Workbook  on  Economic \nEvaluation  of  Environmental  Impacts,  the  total  economic  net \npresent value of tranche 1 subprojects with environmental benefits \nis estimated to be about $21.9 million compared with $14.1 million \nwithout environmental benefits. \n   \n ", "  vii\nRisks and Assumptions  The  PRC  places  high  importance  on  energy  efficiency  in  its \n11th Five-Year Plan, and benefits from the Investment Program \nwill ensue as long as the Government and GPG continue to make \nthis a priority. Technical risks are addressed by ensuring that the \nsubprojects  will  use  only  proven  technology.  The  amount  of \nenergy savings that can be achieved is dependent on the number \nand  magnitude  of  subborrowers  willing  to  be  part  of  the \nInvestment  Program.  The  EPP-PMO  will  undertake  marketing \ncampaigns to inform potential participants. Subloan repayment is \na risk; it will be kept low by ensuring that subborrowers have a \npositive  cash  flow  from  energy  savings,  i.e.,  the  repayment \ninstallments are lower than the reduction in monthly energy bills. \nGFTC will constantly monitor the repayments and make suitable \ninterventions to recover the subloans, when required. GPG will \nestablish an energy efficiency fund in 2008 to provide for the \nimplementation support costs of the Investment Program, such as, \nthe  trust  management  fees  of  the  financial  intermediary, \nindependent measurement and verification of energy savings from \nsubprojects, financial incentives to attract more EPP subprojects, \napplication costs associated with clean development mechanism, \ncapacity  building,  information  dissemination,  and  provision  for \nsubloan default. \n   \nGrant Assistance  Grant assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2 million from \nthe  Clean  Energy  Fund  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing \nPartnership  Facility  is  proposed  to  provide  capacity  building \nassistance  for  (i)  module  1:  information  sharing,  training  of \ntrainers, and development of tools; (ii) module 2: appraisal of EPP \napplications,  monitoring  of  implementation  and  evaluation  of \nenergy savings; and (iii) module 3: evaluation of EPP potential, \nbarriers,  new  technologies,  and  estimation  and  projection  of \nenergy  savings.  The  initial  amount,  based  on  available  donor \ncontributions, will be for $800,000. The remaining $1,200,000 will \nbe  considered  for  ADB  approval  when  additional  donor \ncontributions are in place.  \n \nConsultants financed by ADB will be recruited by GPG according \nto  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). Consulting firms will be selected \nthrough  international  competition  using  the  quality-  and  cost-\nbased selection method. Full technical proposals will be required \nand these will be evaluated based on a quality-cost ratio of 80:20. \nTo ensure continuity between the two phases, GPG will invite \nproposals from consulting firms for the phased implementation of \nactivities,  but  the  implementation  of  phase  II  activities  will  be \nlinked  to  ADB  approval  of  subsequent  grant  component  of \n$1,200,000.  \n   \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the Guangdong \nEnergy  Efficiency  and  Environment  Improvement  Investment  Program  (the  Investment \nProgram), and (ii) proposed administration of a grant for Capacity Building for Energy Efficiency \nImplementation from the Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership \nFacility. The design and monitoring framework for the MFF is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The PRC has achieved and sustained impressive economic growth averaging 9.5% for \nthe past two decades. It now accounts for 15% of the global economy, up from 3% in 1980. By \n2010, the economy is expected to double from its 2000 level, and quadruple by 2020. Given the \nprojected  growth,  demand  for  energy  and  in  particular  electricity  is  expected  to  continue \nincreasing rapidly. Per capita electricity consumption has risen dramatically, increasing from 340 \nkilowatt-hours (kWh) in 1983 to 1,840 kWh in 2005. Currently, the PRC has the second largest \nenergy demand in the world, and is projected to overtake the United States soon after 2010. By \n2030, the PRC is expected to account for 20% of global energy demand.1 \n  \n3.  The current growth in the PRC\u2019s power generation capacity is unprecedented. Installed \npower generation capacity increased at an annual average of more than 8% during the past two \ndecades. Since 2000, the annual growth of electricity consumption has been about 13%. In \n2006 alone, 114 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity was installed, equivalent to the entire installed \ncapacity in Africa and a record annual increase for any country. An additional 91 GW new \ncapacity was added in 2007. The rapid addition of generation capacity has still not fully met the \nsurging electricity demand; since 2002, more than half of the provinces have had to curtail \npower supplies during the summer peak periods. PRC electricity demand increased from 259 \nterawatt-hours (TWh) in 1980 to about 3,250 TWh in 2007, and is projected to increase to 7,230 \nTWh by 2030. \n \n4.  Approximately 69% of the PRC's primary energy demand is met from coal, and 83% of \nelectricity is generated from coal. The PRC has the third largest proven coal reserves in the \nworld. It is the world\u2019s largest coal producer and consumer. Coal production accounted for 38% \nof global production in 2005, and is projected to increase to 49% by 2030. Coal demand \nincreased from 447 million tons of coal equivalent (tce) in 1980 to 1,563 million tce in 2005, and \nis  projected  to  increase  to  3,462  million  tce  by  2030.  Coal-fired  power  generation,  using \nconventional  power  generation  technology,2 results  in  serious  environmental  issues  and \naccounts for about 50% of the nation\u2019s sulfur dioxide (SO ) emissions, 80% of nitrogen oxide \n2\n(NO ) emissions, and 26% of carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions. Acid rain, caused primarily by \nx 2\nSO  and NO , falls on one third of the country. Approximately, 48% of the cities fail to meet the \n2 x\nnational air quality standards,3 and the country is projected to become the world\u2019s largest emitter \n                                                 \n1  Projections of energy demand, electricity consumption, carbon emissions, and energy intensity are taken from \nvarious reports published by the International Energy Agency, including World Energy Outlook, 2007. \n2  The  most  common  conventional  power  generation  technology  is  based  on  steam  turbines  with  subcritical \nparameters and pulverized coal-fired boilers. The \u201ccritical\u201d parameter is 22.1 megapascals, or about 218 times the \nstandard atmospheric pressure, when water changes directly from liquid to the steam phase with the addition of \nenergy.

The PRC currently accounts for 5.1% of global carbon emissions; \n2\nthis is estimated to increase to 28% by 2030. \n \n5.  The PRC has traditionally been self-sufficient in energy. However, the rapid increase in \ninternal demand has increased the reliance on imported energy, and since the quantities are \nsignificant in terms of international energy trade, it is impacting energy security. The PRC is \nanticipated to become a net importer of coal in 2007, with imports increasing to 132 million tce \nby 2015, representing 10% of the world\u2019s coal trade. Declining domestic oil reserves will result in \nsurging imports, from 3.5 million barrels per day in 2006 to an estimated 13.1 million barrels per day \nin 2030. Imported oil is projected to increase from 49% of primary oil demand in 2005 to 65% in \n2015, rising to 79% by 2030. The PRC is currently self-sufficient in natural gas; however, by 2015, it \nis anticipated to import about 22% of the supply, rising to 54% by 2030. \n \n6.  Improving  energy  efficiency  of  the  economy  is  a  crucial  response  to  reducing  the \nenvironmental and energy security impacts resulting from the rapidly increasing energy demand \nand associated increases in power generation capacity. Between 2002 and 2005, industrial \nvalue added grew by 12% per year, while energy consumption grew by 15.9%. The surge in \nenergy demand has been largely driven by the industry sector. Energy consumption by the \nsector increased from 36% of total consumption in 1990 to 42% in 2005, which is substantially \nhigher than the 29% average of member countries of the Organization of Economic Cooperation \nand Development. Compared with international standards, the energy intensity of the PRC \neconomy is relatively high at 9.18 tce per $10,000 of gross domestic product (GDP) (2006), \ncompared with 2.47 tce for the United States and 1.52 tce for Japan. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Key Problems and Constraints \n \n7.  Guangdong province is located in the south of the PRC, with an area of 179,757 square \nkilometers. Its population has been growing at an annual rate of about 2.2% since 1995 and is \nabout 92 million (2005). It has the largest and fastest-growing economy of all the provinces; its \nGDP has grown at a rate of 14% per annum since 1995, significantly higher than the national \naverage. Its GDP was CNY2.24 trillion in 2005, representing approximately one eighth of the \nnation\u2019s total GDP. Guangdong\u2019s industry sector is export orientated and represents 32% of \nnational exports. An analysis of the provincial power subsector is in Appendix 2. Electricity \nconsumption is dominated by energy-intensive heavy industries including cement, iron and steel, \npetrochemical, chemical, clay and porcelain, glass, paper and paper products, metals, textiles \nand  other  manufacturing  industries.  The  industry  and  manufacturing  sectors  combined \nrepresent about 73% of total electricity use; residential consumption is about 13%; and the \nremaining 14% is for transport, construction, farming, and others. \n \n8.  By the end of 2007, Guangdong\u2019s total installed generation capacity was 59.3 GW, \nwhich is greater than the installed generation capacity of all but 13 countries of the world. It has \nrelatively low natural resource endowments, and imports 100% of its coal requirements, 80% of \noil needs, and approximately 20% of electricity from other provinces. The demand for power has \nbeen growing at 13% annually since 1995, outpacing capacity addition. The fast growth in \npower demand is expected to continue reflecting rapid expansion of the economy. Since 2002, \nGuangdong has experienced severe power shortages during the summer peak periods, and \nhad to curtail power supply to many industrial consumers. The estimated power shortage in the \nsummer of 2007 was about 6.3 GW. About 75% of the generation capacity in the province is \nfrom coal-fired power plants, which has caused serious air pollution. About 86% of the province \nexperienced acid rain in 2005; and since 2000, most of Guangdong\u2019s large cities have had an \n ", "  3\nincrease in the number of days when the ambient air quality failed to meet national air quality \nstandards. The energy intensity of Guangdong\u2019s economy is relatively low compared with other \nprovinces in the PRC; however, it is high by international standards. In 2006, energy intensity \nwas 5.87 tce per $10,000 GDP, which was 3.4 times the average of member countries of the \nOrganization of Economic Cooperation and Development, 3.9 times that of Japan, and 2.4 times \nthat of the United States. \n \n9.  Improvements  to  the  energy  efficiency  of  the  Guangdong  industry sector  will  lower \nenergy consumption and the need for additional power generation capacity, thereby reducing \nadverse  environmental  impacts  and  intermittent  energy  shortages,  and  improving  energy \nsecurity.  Improvements  in  energy  efficiency  present  the  opportunity  to  lower  energy \nconsumption at a significantly lower economic, environmental, and social cost than installation \nof additional generation capacity. Improved energy efficiency also lowers end users\u2019 electricity \nbills,  improves  production  efficiency,  and  enhances  competitiveness.  Key  constraints  to \nimproving energy efficiency include (i) limited access to low-cost, long-term capital for utilizing \nenergy efficiency technologies; (ii) lack of awareness among industry managers and officials \nabout  the  benefits  of  energy  efficiency  technologies;  (iii)  agency  issues,  such  as,  shared \nincentives for owners and tenants of buildings; and (iv) weak supply chain of energy efficient \nproducts due to low volumes (demand) and thus higher unit prices. These barriers severely \nconstrain  private  sector  participation  in  energy  efficiency  investments,  particularly  the \ndevelopment of energy service companies (ESCOs), which have generally been highly effective \nin delivering energy efficiency benefits to industry in industrialized countries. \n \n2.  Opportunities \n \n10.  Due to the relatively large size of the Guangdong economy and its underinvestment in \nenergy efficiency, the potential for energy efficiency improvement is large. During the next 15 \nyears,  its  power  subsector  has  an  estimated  cost-effective  energy  efficiency  improvement \npotential of 17 GW (32% of current installed generation capacity) and 41 TWh per annum.4 This \npotential can be realized at less than half the cost of construction and generation from coal-fired \nconventional power plants. In aggregate, investment in a broad range of energy efficiency \ntechnologies will lower energy demand in sufficient quantities to displace the requirement to \nconstruct conventional power plants. The aggregated energy efficiency investment is, therefore, \nreferred to as an efficiency power plant (EPP) with the equivalent displaced capacity in MW \nterms, although the efficient equipment is installed in the premises of many consumers. \n \n11.  Power  subsector  analysis  indicates  that  projects  focusing  on  retrofitting  of  energy-\nintensive  facilities  at  existing  industrial  and  commercial  establishments  are  the  most  cost-\neffective  areas  for  energy  efficiency  improvement.  Opportunities  for  retrofit  efficiency \ninvestments exist for motors, transformers, lighting, air conditioning, etc. Improvement in the \nefficiency of energy consumption, as seen from international experience, has two significant \nbenefits: (i) less primary energy supply will be needed for economic growth, which strengthens \nenergy security; and (ii) less fossil fuel will be used, which will lower pollution and greenhouse \ngas emission. A MW of avoided power generation capacity reduces the investment in energy \nsupply by more than $2 million, and every megawatt-hour saving will avoid 330 kilogram (kg) of \ncoal consumption; and emissions of 780 kg of CO , 9 kg of SO , 3.4 kg of total suspended \n2 2\n                                                 \n4  Asian Development Bank. 2005.

Part B: Prefeasibility \nStudy of Energy Conservation and Resource Management Project in Guangdong. Draft Final Report, July 2007. \nEnergy efficiency improvement potential is not the same as energy-saving potential. The former is achieved by \nusing more efficient equipment and can be measured and monitored, it does not reduce output service, for \nexample, using compact fluorescent lamps for lighting. The latter, however, generally depends on behavioral \nchanges and often leads to foregone service, for example, switching off lights when not needed. \n ", "4   \nparticulates, and 2 kg of NO emissions. Investment in energy efficiency allows a rapid reduction \nx \nin  energy  demand,  which  is  particularly  important  for  provincial  energy  planning  and \nmanagement. An energy efficiency project can save energy in a shorter time frame (a few \nmonths) than construction of equivalent capacity conventional power plants (typically 2\u20134 years). \nIt,  therefore,  provides  provincial  energy  planners  a  useful  energy  supply  development \nalternative. \n \n12.  The establishment of the energy efficiency industry in Guangdong largely depends on \nthe development of private sector ESCOs and high-efficiency equipment manufacturers and \ndistributors that assist industrial and other consumers improve energy efficiency at their facilities. \nESCOs typically assist consumers through a shared savings contract, wherein they initially \nfinance  energy  efficiency  equipment  and  recover  their  investment  from  the  savings  in \nconsumers\u2019 electricity bills. This model has been adopted internationally; however, the PRC has \na number of persistent barriers including low capitalization of ESCOs and lack of access to debt \nfrom local banks. The small but developing ESCO industry in Guangdong can expand into a full \nenergy service industry after removal of barriers. \n \n3.  Strategies of the Government and Asian Development Bank \n \n13.  The Government has implemented significant reforms in the energy sector. The national \nenergy enterprises have autonomy for investment decisions. Coal prices are being gradually \nderegulated; only some of the coal used for power generation is now administratively priced. \nThe power subsector was unbundled in 2003 with the creation of five national and several jointly \nowned  provincial  power  generation  companies,  along  with  two  power  transmission  and \ndistribution companies that have provincial subsidiaries for satisfying consumer demand. The \nindependent State Electricity Regulatory Commission now has a presence in all provinces. The \nNational  Development  and  Reform  Commission  regulates  the  retail  electricity  tariff.  The \ncountrywide average retail tariff in 2006 was CNY0.505/kWh ($0.0656/kWh); in Guangdong it \nwas CNY0.682/kWh ($0.0886/kWh), the highest among all provinces. Time-of-day tariff, which \nleads to greater utilization of generation assets, is being used in most provinces for industrial \nconsumers,  including  Guangdong.  The  tariff  for  industrial  (manufacturing)  consumers  in \nGuangdong is $0.1/kWh and for commercial consumers $0.12/kWh, which is high in comparison \nwith large consumers in industrialized countries and higher than the other provinces. However it \nsends a strong signal for improving energy efficiency. \n \n14.  The Government of the PRC prioritizes energy efficiency and environmental protection in \nthe  11th  Five-Year  National  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  (11FYP).  It  includes  obligatory  targets  of \nimproving energy intensity by 20%5 and reducing major pollutants by 10%, including SO , which \n2\nis emitted mostly by coal-fired power plants. Energy intensity reduced by 1.23% in 2006 and \n3.7% in 2007, indicating that larger reductions will be needed during the remaining 3 years of \nthe  11FYP.    Since  announcement  of  the  targets,  the  State  Council  issued  a  number  of \nguidelines and plans to strengthen the nation\u2019s efforts on energy efficiency improvement and \npollutant reduction. The recently amended Energy Conservation Law became effective on 1 \nApril 2008. \n \n15.  The 11FYP targets have been reallocated to the provinces. Guangdong has targets of \nimproving  energy  efficiency  by  16%  and  reducing  SO   emissions  by  15%  by  2010.  The \n2\nGuangdong provincial government (GPG) recently issued a series of separate strategies to \n                                                 \n5  Energy intensity is the measure of energy input per unit of output, with output measured in financial or physical \nterms. Energy efficiency improves when less energy is consumed per unit of output. The elasticity ratio of energy \nconsumption is the ratio of the increase in energy consumption to the growth of GDP.  \n ", "  5\nsupport the proposed energy efficiency and pollutant reduction targets.6 A policy framework was \nestablished for energy efficiency improvement and pollutant reduction in key sectors including (i) \nenergy-intensive manufacturing industries, (ii) commercial and government facilities, (iii) building \nconstruction,  (iv)  electric  equipment  manufacturing,  and  (iv)  transportation.  The  policy \nframework  also  allows  for  improved  compliance  and  encouragement  of  local  financial \ninstitutions  to  support  energy  efficiency  improvement  and  pollutant  reduction  projects.  The \nGuangdong Energy Conservation and Pollutants Reduction Plan specifically requires GPG to  \n(i) expedite the pilot testing of EPP projects and promote implementation of EPP subprojects, \nand (ii) develop a strong ESCO industry. GPG views the Investment Program as an integral \ncomponent of the provincial strategy to achieve the 11FYP energy intensity target. A summary \nof the GPG policy framework is attached to the framework financing agreement (Schedule 1 \u2013 \nRoad Map and Investment Program). \n \n16.  The proposed Investment Program is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \n(i) Medium-Term Strategy II, 2006\u20132008 strategic priority of managing the environment, and  \n(ii) the strategic development objectives of the country strategy and program for sustainable \ndevelopment of energy and economic growth.7 It is also aligned with ADB\u2019s energy sector \npolicies.8 ADB has been actively supporting policy reforms and the development of energy \nefficiency projects in the PRC, including a number of technical assistance (TA) projects for \npolicy  reforms9 and  recent  inputs  for  designing  the  Investment  Program.10 In  2005,  ADB \n                                                 \n6  Guangdong  Electricity  Demand  Side  Management  Implementation  Plan,  20  November  2006;  Plan  on \nStrengthening Energy Conservation Effort in Guangdong, 22 November 2006; Guangdong Provincial Mid- and \nLong-Term Energy Conservation Plan, 5 June 2007; Guangdong Comprehensive Energy Conservation and \nPollutants Reduction Plan, 19 July 2007. \n7  ADB. 2006.

Lessons  \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s experience in the PRC\u2019s energy sector indicates that projects are generally well \nplanned and implemented smoothly. The overall implementation performance of ADB\u2019s energy \nportfolio is satisfactory (Appendix 3). Several lessons from previous financial intermediation \nloans (FILs) and project loans relate to innovative financing of energy projects. First, to capture \nthe  small-scale  segment  of  the  energy  efficiency  market,  typically  overlooked  by  financial \ninstitutions, ESCOs must be developed; they are currently limited in their capacity to serve \nconsumers by their access to capital. Therefore, the Investment Program will extend loans for \nthe emerging ESCO industry in Guangdong. This is consistent with the initial findings of three \nongoing country studies\u2014Brazil, PRC, and India\u2014being implemented by the World Bank and \nUnited Nations Environment Programme. \n \n18.  Second,  some  projects  encountered  difficulty  in  adequately  verifying  actual  energy \nefficiency  improvements;  this  detracts  from  demonstrating  project  benefits.  The  Investment \nProgram includes an independent postinstallation verification and monitoring component to \ncapture the project benefits. Third, some FILs encountered implementation difficulties due to \nlack  of  technical  capacity  in  project  identification  and  assessment  within  the  financial \nintermediary. This issue will be addressed by the EPP Project Management Office (EPP-PMO) \nproviding technical support. Fourth, some demonstration projects have not been replicated. The \nInvestment Program will improve the probability of replication by providing targeted support for \nESCOs  and  working  with  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  to  widely \ndisseminate lessons and propose the EPP model to other provinces.  \n \n19.  Other  approaches  for  reducing  energy  demand  are  being  designed.  The  Energy \nEfficiency  Multi-Project  Financing  Program  prepared  by  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment in 2007 has a guarantee mechanism for domestic banks when a preselected ESCO \nprovides the technical services for improving energy efficiency in buildings. The World Bank is \npreparing a normal FIL, which includes capacity building input from the Global Environment \nFacility; and another private sector proposal extends guarantees for loans offered by partner \ndomestic banks to utility companies to help consumers improve their efficiency of gas and \ndistrict heat use. Considering the extremely large potential for improving energy efficiency in the \nPRC, pilot implementation of various approaches is justified. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \n20.  The Investment Program is to finance, for up to $100 million, an EPP investment in \nGuangdong province equivalent to 107 megawatt (MW). Appendix 4 provides a summary of the \nestimated  energy  (in  terms  of  megawatt-hours)  and  demand  (MW)  savings  for  the  nine \nsubprojects included in the first financing tranche and the Investment Program. The energy \nsavings will result from retrofitting existing equipment with more efficient equipment, which in \naggregate will reduce the need to construct and operate an equivalent coal-fired conventional \npower plant. The proposed Guangdong EPP will be the first of its kind in the PRC. It requires \ndesigning a suitable model as a pilot in Guangdong that can be scaled up and replicated in \nother high energy consuming provinces.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "  7\nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n21.  The  impact  of  the  Investment  Program  will  be  improved  energy  security  and \nenvironmental  conditions  in  Guangdong.  The  outcome  will  be  an  improvement  in  energy \nefficiency in industry and commercial sectors in Guangdong. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n22.  The outputs include (i) establishment of an onlending model that will enable an EPP to \nbe developed with annual 532 gigawatt-hours of energy savings and an equivalent 107 MW \ncapacity, (ii) development of the ESCO sector in Guangdong, (iii) development of capacity for \npromoting and assessing energy efficiency projects, and (iv) replication of the EPP model in \nother provinces. Implementation of the EPP will avoid consumption of 175,813 tons/year (t/y) of \ncoal,  resulting  in  emission  reductions  of  415,560  t/y  of CO ,  1,785  t/y  of  total  suspended \n2\nparticulates, 4,795 t/y of SO , and 1,066 t/y of NO . Postinstallation verification and monitoring \n2 x\nwill be carried out by a third party to ensure energy savings are achieved. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n1.  Benefits of the FIL Modality \n \n23.  Readily available debt is often the key barrier for energy users wanting to use energy \nefficiency technologies for retrofitting; this is the case in Guangdong. The characteristics of such \ninvestments are different from traditional infrastructure project financing, hence, need special \nconsideration;  for  example,  (i)  retrofits  involve  numerous  relatively  small  investments \n(subprojects) with short implementation periods of a few months; (ii) end users11 do not expand \nproduction or develop new products, i.e., no additional revenue; (iii) commercial banks lack the \nunderstanding of energy efficiency technologies and benefits; and (iv) the payback period of \nsubprojects is shorter (generally less than 5 years). Despite the benefits, energy users are \ndisinclined to seek loans to retrofit energy efficient equipment and prefer to obtain capital for \nexpansion and new business. In consideration of these characteristics, the use of the FIL \nmodality is proposed with strengthened implementation supervision, and simplified subproject \nappraisal giving GPG the required flexibility for quicker turnaround of EPP activities. Given the \nnumerous  small  subprojects,  ADB\u2019s  direct  supervision  of  procurement,  disbursement,  and \nsubproject approval will not be necessary under the FIL modality. Further, an FIL will allow ADB \nloan funds to be rolled over for new subprojects as each batch of subloans is repaid, thus \ncreating additional energy savings. \n \n24.  The Investment Program will finance goods and services to reduce energy consumption \nand create savings for subborrowers. The financial intermediary, in this case a registered trust \ncompany,  will  manage  the  special  purpose  trust  that  will  be  established  using  ADB  loan \nproceeds.  The  financial  intermediary  will  appraise  subproject  applications  and  onlend  to \nfinancially  viable  EPP  subprojects.  Repayments  of  subloans,  net  of  transfers  to  GPG  for \nservicing the ADB loan, will be used for further onlending. By law and under regulatory oversight, \nthe  trust  company  is  required  to administer  the  funds  according  to  the  terms  of  the  trust \nagreement and may not commingle the funds with other trust funds. Unlike a commercial bank, \nthe trust account will be kept distinct from its own assets, which offers protection against \nadverse results from other financial operations of the company. Thus, GPG will be able to \nensure that ADB loan proceeds are only used to implement EPP subprojects and will not be \n                                                 \n11 In this report, the term end user refers to the entity that will borrow to retrofit equipment in its own facilities; the term \nmiddle user refers to the entity that will borrow to retrofit equipment in facilities owned by other users of electricity. \n ", "8   \nexposed to other banking risks. The trust company will earn a management fee from GPG for \nthe service. \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s Operations Manual12 defines and establishes the criteria for eligible financial \nintermediaries that onlend funds under the FIL modality. These include: (i) financial soundness; \n(ii) adequate credit and risk financial management practices; (iii) compliance with prudential \nregulations; (iv) acceptable corporate and financial management practices; (v) sound business \nobjectives and strategy; (vi) autonomy in lending and pricing decisions; and (vii) adequate \npolicies,  systems  and  procedures  to  assess  and  monitor  the  economic,  social,  and \nenvironmental  impacts  of  subprojects.  In  addition,  financial  intermediaries  should  have  or \ndevelop capacity to mobilize domestic resources. In the past, financial intermediaries have \nusually  been  commercial  or  development  banks  and  the  requirements  were  structured \naccordingly. For this Investment Program, a special single purpose trust that supports GPG's \nenergy efficiency program will be established and managed by a duly registered trust company, \nthe Guangdong Finance Trust Company Ltd. (GFTC). As a result, criteria (vi) and (vii) above are \nnot applicable to GFTC, and will be carried out by other participating entities. Lending and \npricing decisions will be made by GPG as it bears the risk of the project, EPP-PMO will \nundertake the requirement in item (vii). Due diligence of GFTC indicates that the company is \nfinancially sound, has adequate credit and risk management policies, acceptable corporate and \nfinancial management practices, complies with prudential regulations and has a sound business \nstrategy. Given that GFTC is neither a commercial bank nor a development financial institution, \nas has been the case in FILs in the past, the requirement to relend ADB's loan proceeds to a \nfinancial intermediary13 is not applicable; instead of relending the loan proceeds, it will be made \navailable to GFTC through a trust agreement. \n \n26.  While GFTC may review and reject any subproject that does not meet its financial or \ncredit risk thresholds, it will not have autonomy to set the interest rate, as the Investment \nProgram is designed to promote investment in energy efficiency technologies which may include \nincentives. Rather, GFTC\u2019s revenue will be derived from management fees and its interest will \nbe protected through the trust agreement. The current barriers to borrowing for EPP subprojects \nhave prevented the establishment of a benchmark interest rate for such loans from domestic \nbanks.  However,  the  trust  agreement  with  GPG  will  allow  GFTC  to  keep  the  term  of  the \nsubloans as 5 years to match the payback period of the subprojects. The interest rate will be set \nwithin the allowable band of the 6-month interest rate set by the People's Bank of China for \nlending by commercial banks.14 Onlending will be restricted to EPP subprojects that satisfy the \nselection  criteria  agreed  under  the  Investment  Program  and  that  have  been  technically \nappraised by the EPP-PMO. Moreover, the selection criteria exclude lending for subprojects that \ninvolve land acquisition or involuntary resettlement, which significantly lowers the safeguard \nrisks. \n \n2.  Use of the Multitranche Financing Facility \n \n27.  The success of this pilot EPP Investment Program will depend on how quickly barriers \ncan be lowered and necessary investments are made by end users. An MFF is proposed to \nenable GPG to increase the awareness of EPP, recruit appropriate EPP subprojects, and \nexpand  and  implement  the  Investment  Program  in  a  systematic  manner.  A  phased \nimplementation is planned under successive tranche loans of the MFF to manage the risk of the \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2003. Operations Manual.

However, the People\u2019s Bank of \nChina allows interest rates to be fixed within a narrow band to reflect the credit risk of the borrower. \n \n ", "  9\ninnovative approach for reaching out to end users. While implementation of subprojects under \ntranche  1  is  in  progress,  the  EPP-PMO  will  seek  applications  from  other  high  impact \nsubborrowers  with  potential  for  higher  energy  savings.  The  experience  gained  during  the \nselection and design of subprojects in tranche 1 will also be used to solicit applications from \nother types of subborrowers (e.g., budget-funded institutions like schools and hospitals) and \nimprove the technical design of subsequent subprojects. \n \n3.  Potential Benefits from Use of the Clean Development Mechanism \n \n28.  The rigor of the subproject certification functions in the Investment Program creates an \nopportunity for the EPP-PMO to help borrowers develop the subprojects into clean development \nmechanism  (CDM)  projects  and  consolidate  them  for  registration  for  certified  emission \nreductions (CERs). The CDM is a market-based arrangement under the Kyoto Protocol allowing \nindustrialized countries with greenhouse gas reduction commitment to invest in projects that \nreduce carbon emission in developing countries as an alternative to more expensive emission \nreductions in their own countries. CERs will be achieved under the Investment Program by the \navoided equivalent of coal-fired generation.  \n \n29.  The subprojects identified under tranche 1 have potential carbon revenue ranging from \n5% to 10% of the subprojects' total investment cost. This is a conservative estimate based on \nthe cumulative CO emission reductions until 2012, the end of the first commitment period under \n2 \nthe Kyoto Protocol. Once the CERs are registered, the Asia Pacific Carbon Fund administered \nby ADB under the Carbon Market Initiative can consider upfront purchase of a maximum of 50% \nof the CERs generated by 2012.15 Potential payments range from $1.2 million to $2.4 million. \n \n4.  Private Sector Participation \n \n30.  ESCOs have played an important role in implementing energy efficiency projects in \ndeveloped  countries.  Their  business  model  requires  considerable  capital  because  the \nrepayments from end users are spread over a longer period to keep within the actual saving in \nelectricity expenditure. In Guangdong and elsewhere in the PRC, ESCOs are still a fledgling \nindustry due to limited access to capital, as local banks lack knowledge of energy efficiency \nmatters and have been reluctant to lend when sales revenues are not being increased. The \nInvestment Program will extend a line of credit to ESCOs that they can draw upon for installing \nefficient equipment in their client\u2019s premises and recover their cost over the duration of the \nsubloan. It will thereby demonstrate a model for appropriately assessing financial and technical \nrisks, monitoring implementation and evaluating savings that local banks can use to support \nprivate sector ESCOs and end users\u2019 EPP subprojects. \n \n5.  Replicability \n \n31.  The  simplified  onlending,  application  assessment,  and  procurement  procedures \nproposed under the Investment Program are designed to facilitate participation of a wide variety \nof EPP subprojects. At the same time, it will have a stronger mechanism for supervision of \nimplementation and evaluation of results through the EPP-PMO, and third party measurement \nand verification of results. In cases where subprojects result in a lower saving, the EPP-PMO \nwill have the responsibility to (i) engage other end users to take subloans and implement EPP \nsubprojects, and/or (ii) tighten the technical eligibility criteria for subprojects in subsequent \ntranches. Once the model is adopted by the wide variety of EPP subborrowers, its scalability \n                                                 \n15  The proceeds from the sale of CERs cannot be commingled with the subloans. When such sales take place, part of \nthe proceeds will be transferred to the EPP-PMO in consideration of its aggregation of the small subprojects, and \nused for promoting more EPP subprojects. \n ", "10  \nand replicability will be assured, and GPG may attract other external resources for its energy \nefficiency programs. \n \nD.  Program Investment Plan \n \n32.  The Investment Program cost is estimated at $142 million (Table 1).16 The total cost \nincludes  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  interest  and  other  charges  during \nimplementation.

Financing Plan \n \n33.  The Government has requested financing of up to an equivalent of $100,000,000 from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the Investment Program. Financing will be \nprovided in accordance with ADB policy.17 The MFF will extend multiple loans18 to finance \nenergy efficiency subprojects under the Investment Program, subject to the submission of a \nrelated periodic financing request (PFR) by the Government and execution of the related loan \nand project agreements. The Government has entered into a framework financing agreement \n(FFA) with ADB, and is obligated to comply with its requirements.19 The minimum amount of a \nPFR will be $20,000,000. Each PFR will be accompanied by a list of EPP subprojects identified \nfor financing. All provisions of the loan regulations applicable to loans based on the London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)20 will apply to each loan, subject to any modifications that may \nbe included under the individual loan agreement. The Government has the option to choose \nbetween eligible currencies and the interest rate regime for each loan. The specific terms for \neach loan will be based on the related PFR with interest rate to be determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility and the applicable commitment charge, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The Government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \n                                                 \n16 An exchange rate of CNY7.5 = $1 has been used for estimation and analysis, which corresponds to the rate during \nloan Fact-Finding Mission. \n17 ADB. 2005.

Pursuant to the FFA, the Government submitted the first PFR to ADB for tranche 1 in \nthe amount of $35,000,000 as an FIL. It will have a term of 15 years. GFTC will onlend the loan \nproceeds for eligible subprojects. Consequently, repayment of the principal to ADB will be \nduring the last 3 years. Subsequent tranches could support similar FIL or project loans. \n \n34.  Financing for each EPP subproject is inclusive of 20% equity by each subloan borrower. \nGPG\u2019s contribution, about 10% of the Investment Program, will be used to cover fees for trust \naccount administration, independent measurement of energy savings, financial incentives to \nattract more EPP contributors, and other implementation-related costs.

The borrower of each loan under the Investment Program will be the PRC, and the loan \nproceeds will be re-lent from the Government to GPG on the same terms and conditions as the \nADB loan. GPG, through GFB, will entrust the loan proceeds to GFTC for onlending to EPP \nsubborrowers. The interest rate will be set within the allowable band of the 6-month interest rate \nset by the People\u2019s Republic of China for lending by commercial banks. GFTC will set up a trust \naccount specifically for this purpose. GPG will bear the foreign exchange risk as it is best suited \nto  manage  the  risk  because  of  its  larger  portfolio  of  foreign-funded  investments,  and  its \nwillingness to support the Investment Program as it relates to public goods, namely, energy \nsecurity and environmental improvement.  \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Investment Program Management \n \n36.  GPG  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  overall  implementation  of  the \nInvestment Program. GPG has established the EPP-PMO to implement the energy efficiency \nsubprojects and will entrust GFTC as the financial intermediary for the purpose of lending to the \nsubborrowers. The EPP Steering Committee (steering committee) is also in place comprising \nsenior  officials  from  Guangdong  Province  Economic  and  Trade  Commission,  Guangdong \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission,  Guangdong  Finance  Bureau,  and  State  Assets \nSupervision and Administration Commission. The committee will provide policy direction and \noperating guidance, and approve subloans. The EPP-PMO will be responsible for nonfinancial \nand technical assessment of applications and supervision of EPP subproject implementation.  \n ", "12  \n \n37.  GFTC,  under  the  terms  of  a  trust  agreement  with  Guangdong  Finance  Bureau \n(representing  GPG),  will  establish  a  separate  unit  to  administer  the  trust.  Its  onlending \nresponsibilities will include assessing the financial viability of the subprojects, disbursing funds \nand managing the subloan portfolio, including subloan collateral and guarantees, and preparing \nfinancial statements. For internal control purposes, GFTC maintains segregation of duties for \nthe various functions of administration, financial accounting, and legal matters. It currently has \nadequate staff for managing the tranche 1 subloan portfolio. Additional staff will be engaged, as \nnecessary, when the number of subloans increases. In the event that GFTC does not meet \nperformance standards to the satisfaction of ADB and GFB, or its financial health deteriorates \nsignificantly, GPG may, in consultation with ADB, propose a new financial intermediary. The \noverall Investment Program management and onlending model is presented in Appendix 6. An \nassessment of financial management of GFTC is in Appendix 7. Details of the Investment \nProgram implementation arrangement are presented in Appendix 8. \n \n2.  Subproject Selection Criteria \n \n38.  The  Investment  Program  will  consider  only  retrofits  of  proven  energy  efficiency \ntechnologies in the following areas: (i) motors and motor-drive systems; (ii) transformers and \nreactive power compensators; (iii) lighting; (iv) heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; (v) air \ncompressors and pumping systems; (vi) recovery of waste energy from industry; (vii) industrial \nboilers  and  industrial  cogeneration;  and  (viii)  other  related  energy  efficiency  improvement \nprojects.  \n \n39.  The EPP subprojects have been selected according to the criteria set out in Appendix 9. \nThe  EPP-PMO  will  apply  the  same  criteria  in  the  selection  of  subsequent  subprojects. \nSubprojects  that  involve  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  issues  will  not  be  considered.  In \nsubsequent batches of onlending, individual subloans that exceed $10 million (the free limit) will \nbe subject to prior review by and approval from ADB. For individual subloans below the free limit, \nADB reserves the right to review subproject proposals and refuse financing for any subproject \nthat does not meet the eligibility criteria or comply with ADB guidelines. \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n \n40.  The Investment Program will be implemented over 5 years between 2008 and 2012. The \nmajority of tranche 1 loan is expected to be disbursed in 2008 soon after loan effectiveness, \nenabling energy savings and demand reduction to be realized from 2008. The PFRs for the \nsubsequent tranches are expected in late 2008 and in 2009. The disbursement of the last \ntranche will be completed not later than 31 December 2012. Onlending to EPP subborrowers \nwill take place according to the implementation schedule set forth in the subproject agreement \nsigned by the EPP-PMO and the subborrowers. As subloans are repaid, the repayments, net of \ndebt service payments to ADB, will be used to finance further batches of EPP subprojects, \nthereby multiplying the benefits of the ADB loan. \n \n4.  Procurement and Disbursement \n \n41.  Procurement will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). Subborrowers will be required to follow the relevant procurement \nrules  in  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  for  financial  intermediaries,  and  adopt  appropriate \nprocedures including (i) payment of reasonable prices; and (ii) fair canvassing when selecting \nsuppliers. Procurement must be from ADB member countries. Subborrowers will be encouraged \nto procure goods through competitive bidding or shopping when such procedures are most \n ", "  13\nappropriate in the interest of economy and efficiency. In case of noncompliance, GFTC will \nexercise the right to recall the subloan. The procurement plan is in Appendix 10. \n \n42.  Disbursements under each PFR will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). The loan proceeds will be paid through GFB \nto a trust account that will be set up upon loan effectiveness of the first loan at a commercial \nbank acceptable to ADB. The transfer of such loan proceeds from GFB to the trust account \nshould take place promptly within 5 working days from approval by the State Administration of \nForeign Exchange Guangdong Branch. The trust account will be managed by GFTC. The \nwithdrawal  request  for  any  subproject  loan  proceeds  will  be  supported  by  a  withdrawal \napplication, and certification from the GFB that the subloan and subproject agreements for the \nsubproject  have  been  executed  between  GFTC,  EPP-PMO,  and  the  related  subborrower, \nrespectively, and include terms and conditions specified in related legal agreements with ADB, \nand  are  legally  binding  upon  the  parties.  This  certification  will  be  a  condition  for  loan \ndisbursement. Additionally, each withdrawal request needs to be supported by the simultaneous \napplication for subloan approval and withdrawal for subloans not exceeding the free limit of \n$10,000,000.00. For subloans in excess of the free limit, copies of the subloan and subproject \nagreements will be submitted together with the subloan approval and withdrawal statement. The \ndisbursements under each subloan may be in several installments based on the readiness of \nthe subproject.  \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n \n43.  Due to the urgency of meeting annual energy savings targets set out in Guangdong\u2019s \n11FYP,  the  EPP-PMO  proposes  commencing  implementation  of  some  EPP  subprojects \nincluded in tranche 1 prior to ADB\u2019s approval of the Investment Program and accompanied PFR \nfor tranche 1. For these subprojects, the Government has requested approval of advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing. For each loan under the MFF, GPG may request advance \ncontracting for the required energy efficient equipment, and retroactive financing of up to 20% of \nthe first loan provided such expenses were incurred in accordance with procurement practices \nacceptable to ADB. The Government has been informed that provision of advance contracting \nand procurement and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the subprojects. For \nsubsequent  tranches,  retroactive  financing  of  otherwise  eligible  expenditures  may  be \nconsidered  and  allowed  by  ADB  Management  when  included  in  a  PFR.  Total  retroactive \nfinancing will not exceed an amount equivalent to 20% of the individual loan and must have \nbeen incurred not more that 12 months before the signing of the related legal agreements. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n44.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government, GPG, EPP-PMO, and GFTC. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nInvestment  Program.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998) are included in the loan regulations and bidding documents under the Investment \nProgram. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Investment Program \nshall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts  of  the  financial  intermediary,  the  EPP-PMO,  subborrowers,  and  all  contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Investment Program. In \naddition, the following characteristics of the Investment Program promote transparency and \nstrengthen governance: (i) dual scrutiny of the subprojects (technical, economic, environmental, \nand social by the EPP-PMO and financial by GFTC); (ii) the use of trust agreement (between \n ", "14  \nGFB and GFTC), and subloan and subproject agreements; and (iii) an information campaign to \nbe carried out by the EPP-PMO to inform enterprises and other large energy consumers about \nthe Investment Program and their entitlements. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n45.  GFB,  GFTC,  the  EPP-PMO,  and  each  EPP  subborrower  will  ensure  that  proper \naccounts and records are maintained and audited in a timely manner to adequately identify the \nuse of loan proceeds. The EPP-PMO, in cooperation with GFTC, will prepare and provide ADB \nwith  quarterly  progress  reports  on  program  implementation.  These  reports  will  include  a \ndescription of progress made during the review period, problems encountered and remedial \nactions taken, and subsequent activities to be undertaken. GFTC will submit quarterly financial \nreports to ADB on each subproject showing transactions during the quarter; loan defaults, if any; \nand any other relevant information. GFTC will submit its audited annual financial statements to \nADB within 6 months after the fiscal year-end. The audit report will include an opinion on the \nuse of the GPG account and the trust account and subloan approval and withdrawal procedures. \nThe EPP-PMO, in cooperation with GFTC, will submit a project completion report to ADB within \n6 months of physical completion of the first batch of subprojects financed under each financing \ntranche, and an investment program completion report within 6 months of physical completion of \nall ADB-supported activities and subprojects under the Investment Program, i.e., after all the \nADB loans extended under the Investment Program are repaid.  \n \n8.  Investment Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n46.  The  investment  program  performance  and  monitoring  system  indicators  and  their \nrelevance were discussed with GPG, EPP-PMO, and GFTC during project preparation. The \nindicators are based on the monitoring indicators in the design and monitoring framework. The \nEPP-PMO, in cooperation with GFTC, will ensure that within 6 months of the effective date of \nthe first loan agreement under the Investment Program, a performance and monitoring system \nis established. The system will be in a form and substance acceptable to ADB in accordance \nwith the Investment Program performance indicators. The system should also include a detailed \nplan for measuring and verifying actual energy savings of the implemented subprojects. The \nEPP-PMO and GFTC will undertake periodic project performance review under each subloan, in \naccordance with the performance and monitoring system to evaluate the scope, implementation \narrangements, progress, achievements of the claimed energy savings, and other benefits of the \nprojects and the overall Investment Program. \n \n9.  Investment Program Review \n \n47.  ADB, GPG, EPP-PMO, and GFTC will meet regularly as required to discuss progress of \nthe individual subloan portfolios and any changes to implementation arrangements or remedial \nmeasures  required  for  achieving  the  objectives  of  the  Investment  Program.  Results  of \nindependent postinstallation verification and monitoring of energy savings will be considered. \nADB and GPG will undertake joint reviews of the Investment Program until it is fully disbursed. \nGPG will develop a monitoring plan and ensure that periodic progress and financial reports are \nsubmitted to ADB regularly. \n \nIV.  CAPACITY BUILDING GRANT FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT \n48.  The  EPP-PMO  is  assessed  to  have  reasonable  technical  expertise  for  energy \nconservation activities. However, considering the innovative design of the Investment Program, \nareas  identified  as  requiring  assistance  include  technical  assessment  for  certain  energy \n ", "  15\nefficiency technologies, economic analysis of subprojects in accordance with ADB guidelines, \nmeasurement and verification of energy savings from subprojects, and development of CDM \nprojects.  \n \n49.  GPG will build the capacity of the EPP-PMO. It plans to establish the Guangdong energy \nefficiency fund to support such activities and meet other related expenses, such as the trust \nmanagement fees of the financial intermediary, independent measurement and verification of \nenergy  savings  from  subprojects,  financial  incentives  to  attract  more  EPP  subprojects, \napplication costs associated with CDM, information dissemination, provision of subloan default, \nand other investment program implementation costs. The fund will be financed by (i) provincial \ngovernment  budget,  (ii)  provincial  energy  surcharge  on  high  energy  users,  and/or  (iii) \ninternational donor grant support. GPG has tentatively agreed to fund $1.5 million for EPP-PMO \noperations in 2008 including third-party savings measurement and verification activities.  \n \n50.  The Government has also requested continued ADB support for the Investment Program, \nparticularly  in  the  area  of  market  analysis  of  the  potential  energy  savings  in  Guangdong, \nimplementation support, and training in various aspects of energy efficiency activities. The \nscope of the project preparatory TA (footnote 10, iii) was expanded to include the initial training \nof EPP-PMO staff, as it processes applications for subsequent tranches. Further, a grant of \n$2,000,000 is proposed for capacity building for energy efficiency implementation to be sourced \nfrom the Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility. While \nseveral donor countries have indicated their intent to contribute to the Clean Energy Fund, the \nfull contributions have not yet been made. The initial approval, based on the allocation from the \navailable  donor  contribution,  will  be  for  $800,00021,  which  will  provide  the  resources  for \nimplementing activities included in the first phase. The remaining $1,200,000 will be considered \nfor  ADB  approval  when  additional  donor  contributions  are  in  place  and  the  allocation  is \napproved under the guidelines for the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, which is \nexpected in mid-2008. The terms of reference, the division of consulting services inputs, and \ncost estimates of the two phases are in Appendix 11. \n \n51.  Consultants under the grant will be recruited by GPG according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Consulting firms will be selected \nthrough  international  competition  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method.  Full \ntechnical proposals will be required and be evaluated based on a quality-cost ratio of 80:20. To \nensure continuity between the two phases, GPG will invite proposals from consulting firms for \nthe phased implementation of activities, but the implementation of phase II activities will be \nlinked to ADB approval of the subsequent grant components of $1,200,000. Grant proceeds will \nbe disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from \ntime to time); direct payment and reimbursement procedures will be used. \n \nV.  INVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Environmental Benefits and Impacts \n \n52.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  prepared  for  the  Investment \nProgram (Appendix 12) concludes that the Investment Program will provide an overall benefit to \nthe environmental conditions in Guangdong. Regional air quality will improve and greenhouse \ngas  emissions  will  be  reduced  as  the  need  for  coal-fired  power  will  be  reduced.  The \nenvironmental benefits include reduction of coal use and emissions (para. 22).  Based on ADB\u2019s \nWorkbook on Economic Evaluation of Environmental Impacts, the total economic value of the \n                                                 \n21  Contributor: Government of Australia. \n ", "16  \nquantifiable environmental benefits from reduced air emissions is estimated to be about $7.8 \nmillion (Appendix 13) over the life of tranche 1. Unquantifiable environmental benefits are also \nsignificant. \n \n53.  Because  the  Investment  Program  deals  with  only  retrofits  of  existing  facilities  at \nconsumer sites, the potential environmental impacts are limited to disposal of the replaced \nelectrical  and  mechanical  equipment  and  appliances.  Disposal  will  comply  fully  with  GPG \nregulations to minimize any potential impacts. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003), the first tranche of the Investment \nProgram is classified as FI as all the subprojects have insignificant environmental impacts.  \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n \n54.  A forecast of the electricity demand in Guangdong considered trends, structural changes, \nefficiency improvements, GDP growth, and other important factors affecting energy demand \nElectricity demand (GWh) was conservatively forecast to grow at more than 10% for 2007\u20132011 \nand about 8% for 2016\u20132020; peak system load (MW) is projected to grow at more than 9% \nfrom 2007 to 2015 and about 7% from 2016 to 2020 (Appendix 2). EPP is a least-cost option to \nhelp balance power demand and supply in Guangdong; it will cost about half of the cost of \npower supply from a conventional coal-fired power plant.  \n \n55.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated to assess the economic \nviability  of  the  subprojects.  The  economic  analyses  were  performed  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects (1997). The economic costs include capital costs, \nand operation and maintenance costs. Appropriate conversion factors were used to convert \nfinancial  values  into  economic  values.  Values  are  expressed  in  2007  local  currency.  The \neconomic benefits mainly include the cost savings of electricity and coal. The economic benefits \nof avoided air emissions were also considered. The estimated EIRR and economic net present \nvalues for the subprojects are shown in Table 3.

Financial Analysis \n \n56.  Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) and Financial Net Present Value. The FIRR \nand financial net present value were computed for each of the nine subprojects as well as for all \nthe nine subprojects combined (Table 4). The financial analyses were carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects (2005).22 The financial costs include \ncapital costs, and operation and maintenance costs. The financial benefits are based on the \ncost savings for electricity resulting from reduced electrical consumption. To be conservative, \nthe potential revenue from sale of the CERs under the CDM is not included in the FIRR \ncalculation. The weighted average cost of capital is estimated to be 7.5%. The FIRRs for each \nof the nine subprojects are higher than the weighted average cost of capital, confirming the \nfinancial viability of the subprojects. The FIRR for tranche 1 is estimated at 16.6% and the \nfinancial net present value at $21.3 million. Sensitivity analyses show that the FIRR is stable \nand robust under various adverse scenarios. The overall FIRR would decrease to (i) 12.8% if \nthe subprojects experience a cost overrun of 20%; (ii) 11.3%, if the benefits are lowered by 20%; \n(iii) 14.4%, if commissioning is delayed by 1 year; and (iv) 4.3%, if (i), (ii), and (iii) all happen. \nThe detailed project financial analysis is in Appendix 14. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Financial Internal Rate of Return and Financial Net Present Value  \nSubproject  FIRR (%)  FNPV ($1,000) \nFenghua Advanced Technology Co.                 16.5  1,231 \nGuangzhou Iron and Steel Co.  24.3   689 \nHuizhou South Thermo-Electricity Co.  22.5  1,771 \nHongtai Trade Co.  18.4  1,487 \nJinguan Energy Services Co.  16.4  1,235 \nHaihong Co.

Financial Performance of GFTC. GFTC is owned by GPG and is the only provincial \ntrust company operating in Guangdong. Strict new rules and regulations introduced by the \nChina  Banking  Regulatory  Commission,  following  the  industry  shakeout  during  the  Asian \nfinancial crisis, has led the company to reorganize its operations and strengthen its finances. \nThe new regulations mean that GFTC has been provided with paid-up capital of CNY565 million \n($75 million), and must maintain complete separation between its trust operations and its own \nproprietary investments, avoid taking deposits or secure loans against its own balance sheet, \nand conduct its trust business with arms length transactions at fair market prices. Conditions \nthat favor GFTC include Guangdong\u2019s rapid economic development; the strengthened financial \nmarket regulatory framework of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, and GFTC\u2019s own \ngood  reputation  and  financial  strength.  However,  negative  elements  include  lack  of \nunderstanding of trust companies by the general public, lack of innovation, and overregulation. \n \n58.  By the end of 2006, GFTC had fully written off non-performing assets and disposed of \nloans that no longer comply with current trust company regulations. The successful cleaning up \nof the balance sheet was facilitated by GFTC using its own proprietary capital to earn good \nreturns in the buoyant economic conditions that prevailed during 2006. Revenues virtually \ndoubled to reach CNY118 million ($15 million), while operating profits grew from CNY20 million \n                                                 \n22 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "18  \nin 2005 to reach CNY96 million in 2006\u2014an almost five-fold increase. These returns were \nsufficient to cover the write-off (CNY60 million) of the remaining nonperforming loans and \nprovide an after-tax profit of CNY12 million. Fee income from managing trusts made a relatively \nminor  CNY5.6  million  (5%)  contribution  to  revenue,  but  enabled  GFTC  to  leverage  its \nprofessional capabilities and take advantage of its ability to do business in a field that offers a \nrelatively more stable income stream than its other activities. GFTC anticipates that planned \nincreases in its trust management activities will reduce its dependence on the speculative and \nvolatile securities trading business, and thereby help stabilize returns from one year to the next. \nGFTC managed more than 40 trusts in 2006 with a total of CNY995 million ($133 million) under \ntrust management at year-end. Trust accounts under GFTC management are projected to grow \nfrom around 5% of revenues in 2006 to 25% by 2012, thereby ensuring steady financial returns. \nManagement of GPG\u2019s EPP trust will greatly assist GFTC to achieve this objective. The overall \nprofit forecasts to 2012 anticipate that the 26% after-tax operating return on capital employed in \n2006 is likely unsustainable; and while potential returns from stocks may be volatile from year to \nyear, the trend will align closely with the overall national economic growth rate. Growth in the \ntrust  management  portfolio  is  a  potentially  profitable  development,  but  will  require  more \nintensive staff supervision and higher administrative and general costs. Its experience and good \nrecord indicate that the company is capable of managing the proposed Investment Program.  \n \nD.  Social Benefits and Poverty Reduction \n \n59.  By  including  only  retrofits  of  existing  electricity  consuming  facilities,  the  Investment \nProgram will not involve any land acquisition or resettlement. Therefore, no land acquisition or \nresettlement plan is needed. Negative social impacts resulting from worker layoffs are unlikely. \nThe improvement in energy security and environmental quality under the Investment Program \nwill  benefit  the  poor  more  than  the  general  population,  as  the  poor  are  generally  more \nvulnerable under adverse circumstances. The Investment Program will create a number of jobs \nin the energy efficiency service sector. In addition, it will reduce coal consumption, free up \nresources, and lower the risks associated with coal mining and transportation. The summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is presented in Appendix 15. \n \nE.  Risks \n \n60.  Risks associated with potential changes in Government policy and uncertain power \ndemand in Guangdong are minimal. In fact, the Investment Program is an integral part of \nGuangdong's FYP, which mandates 16% energy efficiency improvement during 2005\u20132010, \nand 28% improvement during 2005\u20132020. An analysis of the demand for electricity shows that \nthe province will continue to need additional power supply to sustain its economic development, \nregardless  of  whether  this  is  to  be  provided  through  coal-fired  power  plants  or  EPPs. \nMacroeconomic  conditions  are  expected  to  continue  to  be  sound  with  continuing  political \nstability in the PRC. Strong economic performance is expected in Guangdong based on GPG\u2019s \nprojections and its growth trends. \n \n61.  All subprojects included in tranche 1 are based on proven and established technologies; \nand involve installation of energy efficiency equipment and appliances that have been used \nsuccessfully in the PRC. In addition, most of the proposed retrofits can be implemented within a \nrelatively short time, i.e., 1 to 4 months. For subsequent tranches, all subprojects will use similar \nproven energy efficiency technologies with reliable, measurable, and verifiable energy and \ncapacity  savings.  Third  party  measurement  of  actual  energy  savings  of  implemented \nsubprojects will be carried out to verify the subprojects\u2019 energy savings. Should the actual \nenergy savings be less than originally calculated, the EPP-PMO will be required to strengthen \n ", "  19\ntechnical eligibility criteria and/or recruit more EPP subprojects in each cycle of lending. Thus, \nthe technical risks of the Investment Program are minimal. \n \n62.  The economic analysis of all subprojects included in tranche 1 suggests little economic \nrisk. Sensitivity and risk analyses indicate tranche 1 will be economically viable under various \nadverse scenarios. \n \n63.  The subloan credit risks are minimized in various ways, including (i) requiring the posting \nof  collateral  and/or  guarantees,  (ii)  checking  credit  and  financial  criteria  when  appraising \napplicants, (iii) accepting only subprojects with investment payback periods of less than 5 years \nto  ensure  adequate  cash  flow  for  subloan  repayments,  and  (iv)  requiring  subborrowers  to \nassume at least 20% of total subproject investment cost. GFTC will constantly monitor the \nrepayments and make suitable interventions to recover the subloans, when required. \n \n64.  Successful  implementation  requires  sound  project  and  financial  management.  The \ninvolvement of GFTC and the EPP-PMO addresses both requirements as their strengths are \ncomplementary; they have adequate capacity, but the innovative design of the Investment \nProgram will necessitate additional training. Supplemental TA support provided by ADB would \nfurther assist GPG in strengthening their capacities. GPG has given its support for the model \nthrough budgetary support for part of the costs incurred by GFTC and the EPP-PMO. \n \n65.  The  key  EPP-PMO  personnel  are  former  senior  staff  from  Guangdong  Energy \nConservation  and  Monitoring  Center  with  expertise  in  marketing  and  implementing  energy \nconservation projects. To ensure better implementation results, the Clean Energy Fund grant for \ncapacity building will enable GPG to recruit experienced consultants to strengthen the EPP-\nPMO in the areas of technical assessment; savings measurement and verification; carbon \ncertification under the CDM; and investment program management, monitoring, and compliance. \nGFTC has more than 20 years experience in trust management, and was one of the few trust \ncompanies to be issued a license to operate by China Banking Regulatory Commission. \n \n66.  An additional risk is that end users may not wish to carryout retrofit projects to improve \nenergy efficiency. To address this, the Government and GPG have announced aggressive \ntargets and action plans to require end users to reduce energy consumption per unit of GDP. \nFurther, energy efficiency programs help to mitigate the adverse impacts of energy generation \nand its use on the environment. They foster rational use of energy that conserves natural \nresources, thus helping to reduce dependence on fossil-based generation; they also relieve the \nshortage of energy supply. The Government has carried out public information campaigns to \nraise awareness. For end users, retrofits of energy efficient equipment reduce operating costs \nand  increase  productivity,  so  will  be  inherently  attractive.  Lowering  the  barriers  for  debt \nfinancing will encourage end users to implement EPP subprojects and avail of the benefits. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES  \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n67.  In  addition  to  the  assurances  included  in  the  framework  financing  agreement,  the \nGovernment and GPG have given the following assurances, which will be incorporated in the \nrelated legal documents as appropriate: \n \n(i)  Auditing and accounting. GPG, EPP-PMO, GFTC, and each subproject will \nmaintain  proper  accounts  and  records,  and  ensure  that  such  accounts  are \naudited in a timely manner to adequately identify the use of loan proceeds in \n ", "20  \nsuch a manner and detail as may be specified under the loan agreement and \nproject agreement(s). \n \n(ii)  Guangdong energy efficiency fund. GPG will establish an energy efficiency \nfund  not  later  than  31  December  2008  to  provide  for:  (a)  direct  financial \nincentives for EPP subprojects based on actual energy savings, (b) capacity \nbuilding  and  information  dissemination  activities,  (c)  promotion  of  clean \ndevelopment mechanism, (d) expenses related to the EPP-PMO and GFTC for \nthe Investment Program implementation, and (e) other  activities designed to \npromote energy conservation. \n \n(iii)  Energy efficiency policy framework. GPG will establish by 31 December 2008 \nan energy efficiency policy framework to expand and accelerate participation of \nend users in energy efficiency improvement. As a minimum, GPG will establish \nby 31 December 2008 (a) maximum per-unit energy consumption for selected \nenergy-intensive industries such as cement, iron and steel, metals, electricity \ngeneration,  transmission  and  distribution,  petrochemical,  chemical,  paper, \nconstruction materials, and other industries, and related energy auditing and \nenforcement regulations; and (b) incentives (such as direct financial incentives \nfunded by the GPG budget to end users based on achieved energy savings) to \novercome  financial  barriers  to  end  users\u2019  participation  in  energy  efficiency \nimprovement projects.  \n \n(iv)  Policy  change. GPG shall inform ADB in due course of any changes in its \nenergy  efficiency  regulations,  power  pricing,  and  power  dispatch  and  other \nsimilar policies that may adversely affect the financial viability of each financing \ntranche under the Investment Program. \n \n(v)  Governance. GPG will ensure that GFTC maintains proper internal controls in its \noperations.  GFTC  will  adopt  acceptable  computerized  accounting  and \nmanagement information systems, and prepare financial statements and reports \nin accordance with national accounting standards. \n \n(vi)  Development  of  an  EPP  market.  GPG  will  ensure  that  the  EPP-PMO \nundertakes measures to promote energy efficiency and that adequate staff are \ntrained and deployed to fully implement the Investment Program. \n \n(vii)  Compliance  with  national  labor  laws.  GPG  will  ensure  that  any  new \nemployment generated by the subprojects financed by ADB will comply with \nnational labor laws. \n \n(viii)  Subprojects and subloans. GPG will ensure that the EPP-PMO and GFTC will \n(a) select subprojects in accordance with the agreed criteria; and (b) execute \nsubloan and subproject agreements in form and substance acceptable to ADB, \nincluding terms and conditions agreed between GPG and ADB. \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n \n68.  For the first loan only, the trust agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, \nwill have been executed between GFB and GFTC, and will have become effective and binding \nupon GFB and GFTC in accordance with its terms. \n \n ", "  21\nC.  Condition for Loan Disbursement \n \n69.  The  first  loan  will  be  disbursed  when  GFB  certifies  to  ADB  that  the  subloan  and \nsubproject agreements of the amount to be withdrawn have been executed between GFTC, \nEPP-PMO, and the relevant subborrowers, in form and substance acceptable to ADB, and have \nbecome effective and binding upon the parties to the agreements.  \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n70.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove  \n \n(i)  the

Guangdong Power Subsector \n \n1.  Guangdong, with a population of about 92 million, has the largest and fastest growing \neconomy among all the provinces in the People's Republic of China (PRC). Its gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) has grown by 14% per year since 1995; and was about CNY3.07 trillion in 2007, \nrepresenting  approximately  one  eighth  of  the  nation\u2019s  total  GDP.  The  high  growth  was \naccompanied by rapidly growing electricity demand. The growth in demand for power averaged \n13% annually since 1995, outpacing that of capacity addition. Since 2002, Guangdong has been \nexperiencing power shortages during the summer peak periods, and has had to curtail power \nsupply to many industrial consumers. During the summer of 2007, the shortage was estimated \nto be 6,250 megawatts (MW). Electricity consumption and demand in Guangdong is provided in \nTable A2.1.  \n \nTable A2.1: Electricity Consumption and Demand in Guangdong Province, 1995\u20132007 \n  Electricity  Annual  Electricity  Annual Growth Rate \n  Consumption  Growth Rate  Demand  (%) \nYear  (GWh)  (%)  (MW) \n1995  78,768  7.6  13,600  7.5 \n1996  85,771  8.9  14,960  10.0 \n1997  91,886  7.1  16,530  10.5 \n1998  98,787  7.5  17,730  7.3 \n1999  108,626  10.0  19,530  10.2 \n2000  133,458  22.9  23,500  20.3 \n2001  145,842  9.3  25,800  9.8 \n2002  168,783  15.7  28,630  11.0 \n2003  203,129  20.4  34,000  18.8 \n2004  238,714  17.5  39,700  16.8 \n2005  267,356  12.0  44,150  11.2 \n2006  299,105  11.9  49,700  12.1 \n2007  339,301  13.0  55,829  12.3 \nGWh = gigawatt-hour, MW = megawatt. \nSource: Guangdong provincial government and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n2.  By the end of 2007, Guangdong's total installed generation capacity was 59,323 MW. \nCoal-fired power plants account for 45,109 MW (76%), hydropower 7,830 MW (13%), nuclear \npower 3,780 MW (6.4%), pumped storage 2,400 MW (4%), and wind power 204 MW (0.3%). \nGuangdong imports electricity from other provinces to meet about 20% of its electricity demand. \nThe coal-fired power plants contribute significantly to environmental problems. \n \n3.  Demand for electricity is expected to continue its rapid growth. An econometric model \nwas used to forecast demand considering growth in GDP and population, structural changes in \nindustries, and efficiency improvement (Table A2.2).  \n \n \n ", "Appendix 2  25 \nTable A2.2: Projections of Guangdong\u2019s Electricity Consumption and Demand \nElectricity  Annual Growth  Electricity  Annual Growth \nYear  Consumption  Rate  Demand  Rate \n(GWh)  (%)  (MW)  (%) \n2008  380,696  12.2  62,403  11.8 \n2009  422,572  11.0  69,418  11.2 \n2010  469,055  11.0  76,869  10.7 \n2011  515,492  9.9  84,750  10.2 \n2012  566,525  9.9  93,056  9.8 \n2013  622,611  9.9  101,784  9.4 \n2014  684,250  9.9  110,927  9.0 \n2015  751,991  9.9  120,483  8.6 \n2016  810,646  7.8  130,445  8.3 \n2017  873,876  7.8  140,809  8.0 \n2018  942,039  7.8  151,571  7.6 \n2019  1,105,518  7.8  162,726  7.4 \n2020  1,094,728  7.8  174,270  7.1 \nGWh = gigawatt-hour, MW = megawatt. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n4.

Many  of  the  industrial  facilities  are  old  with  relatively  low-efficiency  capital  stock. \nAlthough the size of Guangdong\u2019s economy would rate among the top 20 countries, overall \nenergy efficiency lags international standards. In 2006, energy efficiency in terms of standard \ntons of coal equivalent (tce) per $10,000 GDP was 5.87, 3.4 times the average of member \ncountries of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, 3.9 times that of \nJapan, or 2.4 times that of the United States. Guangdong\u2019s electricity efficiency in 2005 was \n1,195 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per CNY10,000 GDP, ranking it 14th among the PRC provinces. \nThe potential for energy efficiency improvement is large; the power subsector has an estimated \ncost-effective energy efficiency improvement potential of 17,000 MW and 41,210 gigawatt-hours \nper year energy saving.1 Least-cost opportunities for retrofit efficiency investments are available \n                                                 \n1  Optimal Energy, Inc. 2007.

The PRC has several options for developing an efficiency power plant (EPP): (i) fully \nintegrate EPP in its power reform, whereby EPP-related costs are included in electricity prices, \nideally  in  concert  with  specific  price  reforms  designed  to  encourage  energy  efficiency;  (ii) \npartially integrate EPP in its power reform, whereby EPP-related costs are paid with public \nbenefit funds collected through a small uniform system benefits charge applied to electricity \nprices; (iii) consider the development of EPP to be a government function with a government \nagency or a public company designated for implementing energy efficiency subprojects that are \nbundled  into  an  EPP;  or  (iv)  the  energy  efficiency  subprojects,  investments,  and  loan \nrepayments are aggregated with a government agency assuming the responsibility to implement \nthe EPP, but participating consumers being responsible for their pro rata share of the costs. The \nfirst two options involve resetting electricity tariffs, which is not within the control of the provincial \ngovernments. The third option requires considerable budget resources although benefits will \nmostly accrue to the participating consumers. The Guangdong provincial government (GPG) \nhas selected the fourth option with a complementary program to attract consumers to participate \nin the EPP. \n \n7.  PRC recently amended the Energy Conservation Law of 1997. The amendments include \n(a) expansion of sectors brought within the ambit of the law, such as, the transport sector; \n(b) requiring government at all levels to increase investment in public transportation, improve \nservices,  and  encourage  people  to  use  public  transportation;  and  (c)  strengthening  of \nadministrative  enforcement  of  energy  conservation.  Local  energy  saving  standards  are \nexpected to be more stringent than those set by central government, and achievement of \nenergy conservation targets are incorporated into the performance evaluation of the responsible \ngovernment officials.  \n \nB.  Energy Service Companies  \n \n8.  Energy services are a young industry in Guangdong. At present only 13 energy service \ncompanies (ESCOs) are registered with the China Energy Management Companies Association. \nMost of them are small privately owned companies. ESCOs typically offer large energy users \nfree energy audits to identify and recommend cost-effective energy-saving measures. Once the \nenergy  users  agree,  ESCOs  develop  and  design  detailed  energy-saving  proposals.  To \npersuade energy users to implement recommended energy-saving proposals, ESCOs typically \noffer a shared savings or an energy performance contract. These contracts enable the ESCOs \nto finance the front-end cost of energy-saving equipment. The users use the savings from \nenergy  expenditure  to  pay  for  the  ESCO  investment,  including  a  reasonable  return  on \ninvestment. ESCOs negotiate their share of energy savings (typically 50%\u201480%) with energy \nusers so that the payback period is 3\u20138 years. After the payback period, energy users retain the \nfull benefit of reduced energy consumption.  \n \n9.  In  this  business  model,  the  critical  success factor  is the  availability  of  capital.  The \nESCOs need to borrow funds to implement energy savings for new energy users. This has been \ndifficult because of the narrow asset base that they possess. The growth of ESCOs has been \nseverely restricted by the lack of capital; numerous smaller ESCOs had to close within a year or \ntwo as they were unable to build the equity needed to sustain their business. Commercial banks \nhave been reluctant to lend to ESCOs because of a lack of understanding of the technologies \nand production processes; and they were unable to properly evaluate the risk profile of this new \nbusiness model, specially the use of shared savings and energy performance contracts. When \ncommercial banks do lend for the sake of maintaining relationships, they generally require a \n ", "Appendix 2  27 \nloan guarantee that considerably increases the cost of borrowing. The ESCOs interviewed \nduring project preparation indicate that (i) the lack of finance limits their capacity to enter into \nshared savings contracts; (ii) the majority of industrial energy users prefer shared savings \ncontracts because ESCOs share the technology and financial risks; and (iii) when such energy \nservices were not available, energy users generally deferred retrofit projects and the opportunity \nto save energy (and fuel expenses) was lost.  \n \n10.  In countries like Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, ,ESCOs have been \nplaying an important role by helping energy users improve energy efficiency and reduce energy \nconsumption. In Guangdong, the large industrial and commercial users that account for more \nthan 73% of total electricity consumption are busy expanding their businesses; they either lack \nthe capacity or are reluctant to divert their resources to energy efficiency improvement. GPG \nhas announced an aggressive program to reduce energy consumption per unit of GDP by 16% \nduring 2006\u20132010. To be able to realize the energy-saving potential, particularly by the medium-\nsized and smaller energy users, the ESCOs must be helped to overcome the financing barrier \nand thus be able to grow bigger and stronger.  \n \nC.  Environmental Impact of the Energy Sector \n \n11.  Analysis of the power subsector indicates that projects focusing on retrofitting of energy-\nintensive  facilities  at  existing  industrial  and  commercial  establishments  are  the  most  cost-\neffective  areas  for  energy  efficiency  improvement.  Opportunities  for  retrofit  efficiency \ninvestments exist for motors, transformers, lighting, and air conditioning, etc. Improving the \nefficiency of energy consumption, as seen from international experience, has two significant \nbenefits: (i) less primary energy supply will be needed for economic growth, which strengthens \nenergy security; and (ii) less fossil fuel will be used, which will lower pollution and greenhouse \ngas emission. A MW of avoided power generation capacity reduces the investment in energy \nsupply by over $2 million, and every MWh saving will avoid consumption of 330 kilogram (kg) of \ncoal; and emissions of 780 kg of carbon dioxide, 9 kg of sulfur dioxide, 3.4 kg of total suspended \nparticulates, and 2 kg of nitrogen oxide. Investment in energy efficiency allows a rapid reduction \nin  energy  demand,  which  is  particularly  important  for  provincial  energy  planning  and \nmanagement. An energy efficiency project can save energy in a shorter timeframe (a few \nmonths) than construction of equivalent capacity conventional power plants (typically 2\u20134 years). \nIt,  therefore,  provides  provincial  energy  planners  a  useful  energy  supply  development \nalternative. \n \nD.  Electricity Tariffs \n \n12.  The  PRC's  power  subsector  went  through  major  reform  from  2002  to  2003  when \ngeneration was separated from distribution and transmission. This separation means that the \nbenefits  of  energy  efficiency  get  diluted  as  they  are  now  divided  between  two  entities. \nGeneration companies have no interest in investing in or encouraging end-use energy efficiency. \nThey have an incentive for lowering operating costs to improve supply-side margins, but have \nno interest in lowering demand or peak prices or improving energy efficiency among end users. \nAt the same time, the current pricing method discourages grid company investment in end-use \nenergy efficiency as revenue and profits are linked to electricity sales.  \n \n13.  Investment in energy efficiency is influenced by both price levels and structure, but thus \nfar, end-use energy efficiency has played an insignificant role. The PRC's electricity price and \nstructure are not designed to encourage energy efficiency or address known market barriers to \nenergy efficiency. Although the State Electricity Regulatory Commission was established in \n2003, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) still sets the electricity tariff \n ", "28   Appendix 2 \nbased on costs of power generation, transmission, and distribution, including a reasonable rate \nof return on investments. NDRC has been gradually reforming the electricity tariff structure in \nthe past few years. The price of coal has been mostly deregulated to enable it to adjust to the \nsupply-demand position; the price increase has been rapid. NDRC has linked power supply \nprices  of  coal-fired  power  plants  to  coal  prices.  Further,  the  recent  retail  pricing  reform \nannounced in NDRC\u2019s March 2005 pricing circular links prices for some large customers to their \nefficiency performance. The efficiency of several energy-intensive industries was reviewed and \ncategorized by levels of energy efficiency. Price discounts have been abolished and surcharges \nincreased for the least efficient. This pricing policy has been quite effective; in 2006, it is \nunderstood that about 1,200 high energy-consuming enterprises had shut down, suspended \noperations, invested in energy efficiency, or changed production processes. \n \n14.  The general tariff in Guangdong is comparable to international norms; however, its \nstructure can be improved to give a stronger signal to all end users to improve efficiency of \nelectricity consumption. Table A2.4 shows the representative electricity tariffs in Guangdong \nprovince. Across tariff classes, the cross-subsidies are substantial. The per unit price (CNY per \nkWh) for domestic class is typically higher than that of industrial and commercial classes due to \nload density and pattern of usage. However, in Guangdong, the current per unit prices of \nindustrial  and  commercial  consumers  are  higher  than  the  domestic  tariff.  To  provide  an \neconomic price signal, the current tariff should be gradually adjusted to more closely reflect the \ncost of providing electricity service for each class of end user. The time-of-use rates encourage \nconsumers  to  reduce  demand  during  peak  load  periods,  thus  increasing  the  utilization  of \ninstalled generation capacity. In Guangdong, such rates currently apply only to industrial end \nusers. The market penetration of air conditioning in commercial and residential sectors has \nbeen steadily increasing; severe power shortages in the summer peak period have occurred \nevery year since 2002. Time-of-use rates can be set for large commercial and residential \nelectricity  users,  and  seasonal  rates  (summer  and  other  seasons)  can  be  considered  to \nmotivate end users to use electricity more efficiently. Another improvement is to establish \nunbundled power supply, transmission and distribution tariffs to improve accountability and \nefficiency in each category of electricity service business.  \n ", "Appendix 2  29 \nTable A2.4: Guangdong Representative Electricity Tariff in 2007\nDonguan Fashan Jiangmen Zhuhai Average\nItem Guangzhou CNY/KVA or CNY/KW per month Average $/KW\nDemand Charge (transformer size), o 15.38 18.00 18.00 18.00 18.00 17.48 2.33\nDemand Charge (peak demand) 23.08 27.00 27.00 27.00 27.00 26.22 3.50\nA.

External Assistance \n \n1.  Since approving the first energy sector loan for the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in \n1987, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved assistance for 30 projects for a total of \n$3.5 billion. The assistance is divided evenly between projects that increased energy supply \n($1.6 billion) and that improved the environment ($1.9 billion). On the energy supply side, 47% \nwas for hydropower, pumped-storage, and coal-mine methane projects; 20% for transmission \nlines; and 33% for thermal power. In 1994, ADB supported the implementation of one of the \nearlier combined heat and power plants in Heilongjiang, which is now internationally recognized \nas a low carbon approach to meeting energy demand in colder regions. Similarly, the pumped-\nstorage power project loan approved in 1993 helped expand the capacity of the first such power \nplant  in  Guangdong  province.  It  used  new  technology  (reversible  turbines)  and  was  an \neconomically efficient and cleaner way to meet peak power demand. The coal-mine methane \nproject that started producing electricity in March 2008 is another innovation that addresses two \nmajor concerns: coal-mine safety and emission of greenhouse gases.  \n \n2.  The environment projects helped reduced pollution in urban centers by (i) modernizing \nthe  district  heat  and  domestic  gas  supply  (37%),  and  (ii)  retrofitting  cleaner  production \nprocesses in industries (63%). The industrial cleanup has since been a major thrust area for \nlocal governments; these projects were ADB\u2019s initial efforts to support energy end users. Recent \nADB-financed energy projects have focused particularly on energy efficiency and environmental \nimprovement.  By  improving  efficiency,  the  projects  directly  reduce  coal  consumption  and \nconsequently reduce emission of pollutants, including greenhouse gases linked to global climate \nchange.  \n \n3.  ADB has also provided about 100 technical assistance (TA) projects for the energy \nsector, costing about $50 million, to help prepare projects, provide policy advice, and build \ninstitutional capabilities of utilities (power, district heat, and urban gas supply) that are the \nimplementing agencies of ADB loans. ADB provided TA projects to help restructure the power \nsubsector, formulate power pricing strategy, improve the power planning process, and establish \nthe State Electricity Regulatory Commission. The TA projects also covered clean production, \nenergy  conservation,  energy  efficiency,  and  environmental  management.  ADB  is  currently \nconducting  a  comprehensive  study  jointly  with  the  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission  to  analyze  opportunities  and  challenges  for  promoting  energy  efficiency  and \nrenewable energy. It will make practical policy recommendations to overcome barriers, facilitate \nimplementation of development strategies and industrial policies, explore innovative approaches \nto utilize external assistance, and identify key provinces and projects for piloting high impact \nclean energy projects.1 \n \n4.  ADB has also extended two project loans (totaling $90 million) to the private sector for \npower generation. Its Private Sector Operations Department recently provided a partial credit \nrisk guarantee program with an overall limit of CNY800 million to cover an agreed portion (about \n48% of the overall portfolio) of principal repayment of loans extended by selected partner banks \nto finance energy efficiency projects, which are designed and implemented by an internationally \nreputable  energy  service  company.

The World Bank is another source of external funding for the PRC\u2019s power subsector. \nSince the early 1990s, it has provided more than $6.2 billion to finance 25 projects, most of \nwhich are large-scale thermal and hydropower projects, and power transmission and distribution \nprojects. In recent years, the World Bank provided loans to support the Government\u2019s urban \nenvironment improvement and development of renewable energy. Its projects also have a \nstrong focus on environment energy efficiency and use of renewable energy. One notable \nproject approved in 1998 supported three pilot companies in Beijing, Liaoning, and Shandong, \nwhich were among the first energy service companies (ESCOs) in the PRC.2 The World Bank \nalso provided TAs for power subsector restructuring and heating subsector reforms. In the \ninterest of addressing finance-related barriers for implementing energy efficiency projects, the \nWorld Bank together with other organizations implemented a study covering Brazil, PRC, and \nIndia  to  establish  banking  windows,  explore  guarantee  mechanisms,  support  ESCOs,  and \nattract equity investment in energy efficiency projects. The World Bank is currently preparing a \ntypical financial intermediation loan (FIL) in partnership with domestic banks for approval by \nJune 2008, which will include capacity building support from the Global Environment Facility. \nAnother FIL in the private sector will extend guarantees to loans extended by domestic partner \nbanks to utility companies that help gas and district heating consumers reduce energy demand. \n \n6.  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  is  providing  assistance  for  studies \nregarding options for power sector restructuring and promotion of energy conservation. The \nongoing China End-Use Energy Efficiency Project aims to promote energy efficiency in major \nenergy-consuming sectors such as industries and building constructions.  \n \n7.  The  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  is  the  largest  source  of  external \nassistance  for  the  PRC\u2019s  power  subsector.  It  has  provided  concessional  loans  totaling  \nCNY438 billion for 14 power projects through its official development assistance window. It has \nalso provided special credits to major cities to improve their environment by installing emission \ncontrol devices and equipment in power plants and factories, and by building water treatment \nfacilities. It is considering shifting its traditional focus of assistance in the power subsector from \nhydropower  and  thermal  power  generation  to  energy  conservation  and  renewable  energy, \nparticularly in the western region. The European Investment Bank extended a Euro 500 million, \nmulti-project,  China  Climate  Change  Framework  Loan  in  November  2007  to  assist \nimplementation  of  projects  that  prevent  or  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  German \ndevelopment cooperation, through Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, has approved approximately \n$400 million in mixed credits, mostly for power plants and turbine modernization projects. It also \nsupported the Government in energy efficiency and renewable energy development. Other \nbilateral sources providing export credits or mixed credits in the energy sector include Australia, \nCanada, Denmark, France, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, and United States.  \n \n8.  ADB has established a working relationship with the World Bank in addressing policy \nissues and coordinating lending and TA operations; and exchanges views with bilateral sources \nand the private sector.

ADB\u2019s overall experience with energy sector projects in the PRC has been positive. \nProjects are generally well designed and smoothly implemented, although front-end delays have \noccurred  in  some  projects.  Success  is  attributed  to  extensive  preparation  prior  to  ADB \nintervention, high sense of local ownership, effective leadership in project management offices, \nand  timely  policy  and  enterprise  reforms.  The  front-end  delays  in  loan  signing  and  loan \neffectiveness did not lead to unsatisfactory performance. The Government has implemented \nreforms on investment regulations, which simplify approval procedures and delegate some \napproving authority to the provincial governments. ADB has been working closely with the \nGovernment  to  harmonize  the  two  approval  procedures  to  minimize  project  start-up  and \nimplementation delays. \n \n10.  Project completion and performance audit reports for ADB-financed projects in the PRC \nhighlight the (i) need to improve financial reporting; (ii) need for more attention to environmental \nmatters;  (iii)  advisability  of  using  larger  boiler-turbine  units;  and  (iv)  necessity  for  capacity \nbuilding,  not  only  for  project  preparation,  but  also  for  staff  training  in  operations  and \nmanagement  aspects.

The World Bank review of experience in energy efficiency has shown that projects \nshould seek to test a variety of business models to achieve energy savings. In particular, access \nto appropriate project financing that supports ESCO transactions should be an integral aspect of \nproject design. It also suggests that procurement and disbursement procedures should be \nsimplified as these increase transaction costs and discourages energy efficiency.3 \n \n12.  These lessons were taken into account when designing and preparing the Investment \nProgram.  During  preparation,  lessons  of  experiences  were  addressed  by  (i)  thoroughly \nreviewing project readiness on key factors that may potentially delay the start-up; (ii) carefully \nassessing institutional capacity and strengthening measures to improve corporate governance; \n(iii) providing conservative estimates of the expected energy savings consistent with existing \npractices; and (iv) setting up project implementing units with autonomy for operations and for \nprocurement decisions. \n \n                                                 \n3  World Bank. 2004.

LTD. \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  Guangdong Finance Development Company, established in December 1984, served as \nthe financing arm of Guangdong Provincial Finance Bureau. The company was later renamed \nGuangdong Finance Trust and Investment Company (GFTIC) in 1990. At that time, trust and \ninvestment  companies  did  not  have  a  proper  regulatory  framework  and  many  were \noverleveraged, engaged in high-risk business, and went into insolvency following the Asian \nfinancial crisis. More than 100 trust and investment corporations nationwide were closed by the \nPeople\u2019s Bank of China, including 20 from Guangdong. GFTIC became the only provincial trust \nand investment corporation in Guangdong that survived the crisis. It was reorganized as a \nlimited liability company, and People\u2019s Bank of China reregistered it in 2002. The reregistration \nsharply reduced the scope of GFTIC\u2019s business. For example, it is not allowed to take deposits \nor borrow against its balance sheet. Following the issuance of new regulations on Administrative \nRules Governing Trust Companies and Administration Methods for Collective Fund Trust Plan \nand Trust Companies in 2007, GFTIC was again reregistered by the China Banking Regulatory \nCommission  (CBRC)  on  20  July  2007  and  placed  under  its  jurisdiction;  it  was  renamed \nGuangdong Finance Trust Company Ltd (GFTC). \n \nB.  Ownership and Organization  \n \n2.  GFTC has a registered capital of CNY565.5 million ($75 million), of which 98.14% is \nowned  by  Guangdong  Finance  Investment  Holding  Company  and  1.86%  by  Guangdong \nScience  Venture  Investment  Company.  Both  shareholders  are  government  owned.  The \norganization  structure  of  the  company  (Figure  A7)  is  stipulated  in  the  Measures  for \nAdministering Trust Companies promulgated by CBRC in January 2007. It includes a board of \ndirectors, and a board of supervisors reporting to the shareholders. The board of directors has \nfive members; four are from Guangdong Finance Investment Holding Company and one from \nGuangdong  Science  Venture  Investment  Company.  GFTC  plans  to  add  two  independent \ndirectors. The board of supervisors, comprising three members, has an oversight role. Three \ncommittees  report  to  the  board  of  directors:  Risk  Management  Committee,  Investment \nCommittee, and Audit Committee. GFTC operations are managed by a general manager with \nthe assistance of two deputy general managers, and conducted by six functional departments. \nThe internal audit department reports directly to the board of directors.  \n \nC.  Operations \n \n3.  The roles and responsibilities of shareholders, board of directors, board of supervisors, \nand  management  are  clearly  defined  to  ensure  independence  and  effective  checks  and \nbalances. Mechanisms to separate duties and internal controls are in place. The organizational \nsetup and operating procedures are reported to CBRC, which has the right to examine the \ncompany at any time. Closer supervision of trust companies by CBRC is intended to ensure \nthese  companies  act  prudently  in  conducting  their  business.  GFTC  constantly  reviews  its \noperations for potential risks so that mitigating measures may be taken in a timely manner. It \nhas clear procedures for the internal audit department, which operates independently from other \ndepartments and reports directly to the board of directors.  \n \n \n ", "38  Appendix 7 \nFigure A7: Organization Chart of Guangdong Finance Trust Company Ltd \n \n \nShareholder s   \n \n \n \n \nBoard of  B oard of  \nDirectors   S upervisors \n \n \n \n \nRisk    Investment   Managemen t   Audit \nManagement    Committee     Committee \n \nCommittee     \n \n \n \n \n \nGeneral       Trust   Finance  Trust        Securities     Asset   Internal  \nAdministratio n   Accounting    Accounting  Accounting      Investment     Managemen t   Audit \n                Departmen t\n               \n                \nSource: Guangdong Finance Trust Company Ltd. \n \n4.  GFTC's scope of business, as approved by CBRC, includes management of trust funds \nwith lending services if defined in trust agreements. It can also provide guarantees provided \nthese are not more than 50% of its net assets. Although CBRC's new regulation has curtailed \nsome of its activities, some existing market conditions are favorable for GFTC, including (i) \ncontinued  rapid  economic  development  and  income  growth  requiring  diversified  financial \nservices; (ii) rapid capital market development following the successful reform of nontradable \nshares, introduction of qualified foreign institutional investors, and a regulatory framework that \nallows trust companies to develop new financial services; (iii) new regulations that aim to \ndevelop the trust industry; and (iv) good reputation of GFTC among its clients. The challenges \nthat GFTC faces include (i) trust companies are not understood by the general public; (ii) \ntendency to be overly conservative due to historical problems of the sector; (iii) other financial \ninstitutions are increasingly venturing into trust operations, intensifying market competition; and \n(iv) financial market supervisors tend to overregulate and supervise.  \n \nD.  Risk Management \n \n5.  GFTC's risk management policies are provided by the board of directors with advice \nfrom  the  Risk  Management  Committee,  Investment  Committee,  and  Audit  Committee. \nOperations risks are managed by a set of clearly defined operating procedures, segregating \nduties, and taking a scientific approach in decision making. It also conducts internal audit of its \noperations and postevaluation of its portfolio performance. Its risk management system aims to \nstrike  a  balance  among  research,  decision-making,  execution,  and  audit  and  evaluation \nfunctions. For the Investment Program, GFTC will undertake due diligence of the subproject \napplicants, identify risks, and take necessary mitigation measures to control these risks. \n \nE.  Financial Performance \n \n6.  For the 3 years up to the end of 2006, GFTC reorganized its finances by clearing out \nnonperforming assets and disposing of loans that no longer comply with current trust company \nregulations. By the end of 2006, GFTC had resolved the nonperforming assets in its own \nproprietary books and virtually eliminated loan financing from the balance sheet. As required by \n ", "Appendix 7  39 \nCBRC\u2019s Administrative Rules Governing Trust Companies, GFTC is also making provisions in \nits reserves for potential breaches of trust. The trust compensation reserve stood at CNY1.28 \nmillion at the end of 2006, and is growing at 5% of annual after-tax profits. \n \n7.  GFTC has facilitated the successful restructuring of the balance sheet by using its \ncapital to earn good returns in the buoyant economic conditions that prevailed during 2006. \nRevenues virtually doubled to reach CNY118 million ($15 million), while operating profits grew \nfrom CNY20 million in 2005 to reach CNY96 million in 2006\u2014an almost five-fold increase. \nThese returns were sufficient to cover the write-off (CNY60 million) of remaining nonperforming \nloans and provide for an after-tax profit of CNY12 million. Fee income from managing trusts \nmade a relatively minor CNY5.6 million (5%) contribution to revenue, but enabled GFTC to \nleverage its professional capabilities and take advantage of its ability to do business in a field \nthat offers a relatively more stable income stream than its other activities. \n \n8.  The financial and regulatory developments over the last 3 years have resulted in GFTC \nconsolidating its operations and establishing sound finances with no debt, high liquidity, and a \nmixed portfolio of tradable securities and longer term investments in unlisted financial services \ncompanies. GFTC therefore plans to take advantage of its strong financial structure and unique \nposition in Guangdong to develop its trust management business. Increased trust management \nactivities will reduce its degree of dependence on the speculative and volatile securities trading \nbusiness, and thereby help stabilize returns from one year to the next. GFTC managed more \nthan  40  trusts  in  2006  with  a  total  amount  under  trust  management  of  CNY995  million  \n($133  million)  at  the  end  of  2006.  Trust  activities  are  split  into  two  categories:  entrusted \ninvestments  and  entrusted  loans,  with  one  client  accounting  for  all  of  the  entrusted  loan \nbusiness. Although trust accounts under GFTC management declined from CNY1.2 billion at \nthe beginning of 2006, (because of declining loan balances in the entrusted loans category), \nthey are projected to grow from around 5% of revenues in 2006 to reach 25% by 2012 and \nthereby ensure GFTC achieves steady financial returns over this period. Management of the \nInvestment Program's energy efficiency trust will greatly help GFTC to achieve this target. The \noverall profit forecasts to 2012 anticipate that the 26% after-tax operating return on capital \nemployed achieved in 2006 is likely unsustainable; and while potential returns from stocks may \nbe volatile from year to year, the trend rate will align more closely with the overall national \neconomic growth rate. Growth in the trust management portfolio will entail a concurrent shift to \nhigher administrative and general staff costs, with the overall result being more stable and \nsteady returns on capital employed. \n \nF.  Trust Management \n \n9.  The energy efficiency trust to be established under the Investment Program is protected \nby CBRC\u2019s rules, as each trust is a separate account and cannot be commingled with other trust \naccounts or the proprietary investments of GFTC. GFTC will establish an energy efficiency trust \nmanagement unit with separate functions for (i) assessing financial viability of the subprojects; \n(ii)  disbursing  funds;  (iii)  managing  the  subloan  portfolio,  collaterals  and  guarantees,  and \nnonperforming loans; and (iv) preparing the relevant financial statements. The unit will have its \nown director, supported by three deputies for the functional areas of administration, financial \naccounting, and legal matters. The administrative section will establish procedures, monitor \nsubborrowers' performance, and maintain the database of subloans. The financial section will \nmanage the financial and accounting systems for the trust. The legal section will be responsible \nfor preparation and custody of legal documents and for initiating any legal proceedings that may \nprove necessary. GFTC currently has about 40 staff; this is deemed sufficient for tranche 1 \nsubborrowers.

This environmental assessment and review framework was prepared for the proposed \nGuangdong  Energy  Efficiency  and  Environment  Improvement  Investment  Program  (the \nInvestment  Program)  in  Guangdong  Province,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  The \nInvestment Program proposes utilizing the multitranche financing facility (MFF) of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  The  Investment  Program  will  improve  energy  efficiency  in  the \nGuangdong  economy  and  mitigate  against  environmental  impacts  from  coal-fired  power \ngeneration  by  developing  energy  efficiency  power  plants  (EPPs)  in  Guangdong.  This \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  is  to  guide  the  Guangdong  Provincial \nGovernment (GPG), the executing agency, in the environmental assessment of subprojects \nincluded under the MFF to ensure compliance with the environmental safeguard requirements \nof ADB. \n \nA.  Type of Schemes to Be Assessed \n \n2.  The  Investment  Program  will  include  energy  efficiency  subprojects  located  within \nGuangdong. The subprojects may include retrofits of \n \n(i)  motors and motor-drive systems; \n(ii)  transformers and reactive power compensators; \n(iii)  lighting; \n(iv)  air conditioning, ventilation, refrigeration, and heating; \n(v)  air compressors and pumping systems; \n(vi)  recovery of waste energy from industry; \n(vii)  industrial boilers and industrial cogeneration; and \n(viii)  other related energy efficiency improvement projects. \n \n3.  The  Investment  Program  will  also  provide  support  for  capacity  development  and \ninformation dissemination.  \n \nB.  Environmental Assessment Procedure \n \n1.  Responsibilities  and  Procedure  for  Environmental  Assessment  of \nSubprojects \n \n4.  Responsibilities  and  Authority.  The  Investment  Program  will  be  implemented  in \naccordance with Guangdong's Road Map and Investment Program for energy efficiency. GPG \nwill be responsible for implementation of the Road Map and Investment Program. The EPP-\nProject Management Office (EPP-PMO) will have overall responsibility for ensuring that all \napplicable PRC and ADB environmental standards and procedures are followed.  \n \n5.  Environmental Assessment. The Investment Program is classified as environmental \ncategory  FI,  which  involves  lending  through  a  financial  intermediary.  Tranche  1  has  been \nassessed and is classified as environmental category C, as all subprojects will have insignificant \nimpacts,  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003).  \n \n6.  During preparation of subsequent tranches, the EPP-PMO will assess the potential \nenvironmental impacts from the tranche subprojects. Based on the assessment, the EPP-PMO \nwill categorize the subprojects into one of the following: \n ", "54  Appendix 12 \n \n(i)  batches  of  subprojects  requiring  an  environmental  management  system, \nincluding environmental assessment and review procedures for subprojects; and  \n(ii)  batches of subprojects that will only have insignificant impacts, which will require \na review of environmental implications.  \n \n7.  During assessment of the potential environmental impacts from the tranche subprojects, \nthe EPP-PMO will categorize the subprojects into either category A, B, or C, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). Based on \nthe categorization, the subproject owner will submit to ADB the following reports: category A, a \nsummary  environmental  impact  assessment;  category  B,  a  summary  initial  environmental \nexamination; and category C, a review of environmental implications. The EPP-PMO will ensure \nthat  the  environmental  review  documents  comply  with  ADB  environmental  safeguard \nrequirements.  \n \n8.  The EPP-PMO will submit to ADB the proposed classification of (i) the tranche; and (ii) \nthe  subprojects  for  review  and  approval  prior  to  submission  of  the  periodic  financing \nrequirement (PFR). The PFR for subsequent tranches will include a safeguard compliance \nstatus report for subprojects under all ongoing tranches. In case any major noncompliance is \nidentified, a corrective action plan will be prepared and submitted together with the PFR. GPG \nwill be responsible for ensuring that all PRC and ADB environmental safeguard requirements \nare being achieved and will maintain a centralized database of all environmental reports that will \nbe made available during ADB review missions.  \n \n2.  Environmental Criteria for Subproject Selection \n \n9.  The  following  environmental  criteria  will  be  utilized  when  screening  selection  of \nsubprojects for subsequent tranches: \n \n(i)  The  proposed  subprojects  will  be  energy  efficiency  projects  located  within \nGuangdong province. \n(ii)  The subprojects will not be located in any designated environmental protection \nzone. \n(iii)  Each subproject must be designed, constructed, and operated in accordance \nwith relevant national environmental laws and regulations. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 13  55 \n \n \nSUBPROJECT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Estimation of Economic Costs \n \n1.  This appendix describes the economic analysis for each subproject included in tranche 1 \nand the overall result for all the nine subprojects. The analysis was prepared in accordance with \nthe Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects (1997) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). The input data and assumptions were reviewed and found appropriate. Economic costs, \nexpressed  in  mid-2007  constant  values,  were  used.  These  include the  economic  costs  of \nsubprojects\u2019 capital, operation, and maintenance. Tradable commodities were valued at border \nprices at the prevailing exchange rate. Nontradable commodities are valued by applying a \nstandard  conversion  factor  of  0.987  and  the  following  specific  conversion  factors:  1.0  for \nequipment, 1.0 for skilled labor, and 0.67 for unskilled labor. The capital costs are net of \nallowances for price inflation, interest during construction, and taxes.  \n \nB.  Estimation of Economic Benefits \n \n2.  For the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) calculations, the cost savings were \ngenerally valued at the avoided generation, transmission, and distribution costs of electricity \nsupply arising from the energy efficiency improvement projects. In the case of the boiler retrofit \nfor Huizhou Southeast Thermo-Electricity Co., the electricity savings from power plant efficiency \nimprovement  are  supplemented  by  savings  in  coal  consumption.  The  economic  value  of \nelectricity cost savings were quantified on the basis of the avoided marginal costs for electricity \ngenerated by a conventional coal-fired power plant and the associated marginal transmission \nand distribution costs.1  \n \n3.  The energy efficiency improvement subprojects will reduce emissions from coal-fired \npower  plants.  Major  air  pollutants  from  coal-fired  power  plants  include  total  suspended \nparticulate,  sulfur  dioxide,  nitrogen  oxide,  and  carbon  dioxide.2 The  subproject  economic \nanalysis  therefore  includes  allowances  for  the  economic  benefits  of  reduced  air  pollution \nemissions. The economic evaluation of the environmental impact is based on the benefits \ntransfer  method  described  in  ADB\u2019s  Workbook  on  Economic  Evaluation  of  Environmental \nImpacts (1996). The evaluation of the damage caused by greenhouse gas emissions utilized \ndata  from  the  latest  carbon  credit  evaluation  in  Guangdong  province  under  the  clean \ndevelopment mechanism. \n \nC.  Estimation of the Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n4.  The projected EIRRs are high but regarded as conservative, as they take into account \nonly the main benefits of different components, and include all project-related costs. The EIRRs \nfor the nine subprojects range from 16.4% to 34.8% without the environmental benefits and \n20.9% to 44.7% with the benefits (Supplementary Appendix B, Detailed Economic, Financial, \nand Environmental Analyses of Tranche 1 Subprojects). The overall result for the first set of \nnine  subprojects  is  23.3%  without  environmental  benefits  and  28.9%  with.  Table  13.1 \nsummarizes the EIRRs and net present values of economic benefits for all subprojects. The \n                                                 \n1  The marginal cost for electricity generated by conventional coal-fired power plant is CNY0.36/kWh. A benchmark \nfigure of CNY0.16/kWh was used for the incremental transmission and distribution cost. The final result of \nCNY0.52/kWh was used for all economic benefit calculations. \n2  The  estimated  average  emissions  factors  from  a  typical  coal-fired  power  plant  is  0.78  kg/kWh  for  CO ,  \n2\n0.009 kg/kWh for SO , 0.002 kg/kWh for NO , and 0.0035 kg/kWh for TSP. \n2 X\n ", "56  Appendix 13 \neconomic net present value of the nine subprojects included in tranche 1 is $21.8 million when \nenvironmental benefits are included.  \n \nTable A13.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return and Economic Net Present Value \nSubcomponent  Without Environmental Benefits  With Environmental Benefits \n  EIRR (%)  ENPV ($000)  EIRR (%)  ENPV ($000) \nFenghua Advanced Technology Co.  23.5  1,164  30.7  1,865 \nGuangzhou Iron and Steel Co.  33.0  669  41.8  1,007 \nHuizhou South Thermo-Electricity Co.  34.0  1,976  44.7  2,928 \nHongtai Trade Co.  24.8  1,386  31.7  2,118 \nJinguan Energy Services Co.  23.3  1,200  28.8  1,992 \nHaihong Co.  16.4  275  28.8  660 \nZhiguan Electric Co.  17.3  2,694  20.9  5,302 \nLaifu Electric Co.  34.8  1,121  22.8  14,899 \nZhuhai Secopower Transformer Co.  31.2  423  39.5  586 \nTotal for Tranche 1  23.3  14,083  36.5  21,850 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, ENPV = economic net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nD.  Sensitivity and Risk Analysis \n \n5.  Sensitivity  analysis  showed  that  the  EIRR  would  decrease  to  (i)  22.7%  if  all  the \nsubprojects experience a cost overrun of 20%; (ii) 20.7%, if the benefits are reduced by 20%;  \n(iii) 24.1%, if the first set of subprojects experiences a commissioning delay of 1 year; and \n(iv) 18.5%, if (i), (ii), and (iii) all happen (Table A13.2). Even under the unlikely case of (iv) the \nEIRR is still significantly higher than 12%.  \n \n6.  To complement this analysis, risk analysis was performed using a probabilistic approach \nto the perceived risk factors that affect the viability of the whole project. The selected risk \nvariables  include  capital  cost,  avoided  marginal  cost  for  electricity,  electricity  savings, \ncommissioning  year,  foreign  exchange  rate,  and  environmental  benefit.  A  total  of  1,000 \nsimulations were made. Based on the weighted average of all simulated combinations, the \nexpected EIRR of the whole project is 25.9% with a standard deviation of 3.8%. This is 3 \npercentage points lower than the base value without consideration of project risks. \n \nTable A13.2: Sensitivity Analysis of the Economic Internal Rate of Return  \nCase  Change  EIRR (%)  SI  SV \nA.

This appendix describes the input data and assumptions used in the subproject financial \nanalysis. The analysis was performed in accordance with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nguidelines in Financial Management and Analysis of Projects (2005). The analysis focuses on \nthe nine subprojects identified for funding under tranche 1. All costs and prices are in constant \n2007 currency values. For subprojects to be funded by subsequent tranches, similar financial \nanalysis will be conducted. \n \nA.  Capital Cost, Benefits, and Operation and Maintenance Costs \n \n2.  Capital costs are based on projected estimates of investment for the nine subprojects, \nincluding labor, equipment, and materials. Much of the equipment can be purchased off the \nshelf  and  therefore  a  5%  allowance  for  labor  to  cover  installation  is  considered  realistic. \nLikewise a 5% allowance for physical contingencies is provided. The exception is the boiler \nretrofit for Huizhou Southeast Thermo-Electricity Company, for which a 30% labor allowance is \nprovided.  \n \n3.  Financial  benefits  for  all  the  nine  subprojects  are  the  reductions  in  electricity  bills \nresulting from each subproject\u2019s electricity savings, valued at the current applicable electricity \ntariff.  Benefits  in  the  case  of  the  boiler  retrofit  for  Huizhou  Southeast  Thermo-Electricity \nCompany include coal-fuel savings as well as electricity savings from power plant efficiency \nimprovements.  The  analysis  excludes  any  potential  income  from  the  clean  development \nmechanism program for certified emission reductions.  \n \n4.  Operation and maintenance costs are assumed to be about 3% of gross fixed assets. \nNet cash flows from the subprojects were determined after allowing for income taxes at 25% of \nincremental pretax profit.  \n \nB.  Financial Internal Rate of Return and Financial Net Present Value \n \n5.  Table A14.1 provides a summary of the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) and the \nfinancial net present value (FNPV) of each of the nine subprojects, and the overall result for all \nsubprojects. Detailed computations of FIRRs and FNPVs are in Table 14.2. All the FIRRs are \nhigher than the weighted average cost of capital estimated at 7.5% (para. 6). The FNPV for \neach  subproject  is  calculated  using  the  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital.  The \nsubprojects are potentially financially attractive. The financial viability of the entire tranche 1 was \nsubjected to sensitivity analysis under various adverse conditions (Table 14.3). The sensitivity \nanalysis indicates that the entire tranche of nine subprojects remain stable and robust under \nvarious adverse scenarios.  \n \nC.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital  \n \n6.  The weighted average cost of capital was calculated after tax, in real terms using actual \ncapital mix and costs of funds. The result is 7.5%. Actual interest rates of local loans were used \nand for the ADB loan the interest rate is based on the current London interbank offered rate on \n5-year fixed-interest swap (currently at 4.9%) plus the ADB loan spread of 0.6%. The cost of \nequity was assumed to be 25.0%, based on the current financial performances of the nine \nsubborrowers, which generally have returns on capital employed of this magnitude or better.1 \n                                                 \n1  These subprojects will be implemented by energy consumers that are subject to market-based pricing, unlike the \nusual ADB-funded projects for the supply side that have administered pricing and the government expects none or \nlittle return on equity. The high cost of equity has, therefore, led to a higher weighted average cost of capital than \nthe usual ADB projects.  \n ", "58  Appendix 14 \nThe income tax rate is 25.0%, and the average domestic inflation rate is assumed to be 2.5% \nper year. \n \nTable A14.1: Financial Internal Rates of Return and Financial Net Present Value \nSubprojects  FIRR (%)  FNPV ($000) \nFenghua Advanced Technology Co.                 16.5  1,231 \nGuangzhou Iron and Steel Co.  24.3   689 \nHuizhou South Thermo-Electricity Co.  22.5  1,771 \nHongtai Trade Co.  18.4  1,487 \nJinguan Energy Services Co.  16.4  1,235 \nHaihong Co.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe Guangdong Energy Efficiency and Environment Improvement Investment Program (Investment Program) involves \ninvestments to improve energy efficiency in the industry, commercial, and other high energy consuming sectors in Guangdong \nProvince. By providing economically and environmentally superior substitutes for conventional electricity generation, the \naggregate savings from such investments can be thought of as an efficiency power plant (EPP). The strategy for assistance \nand operations in the 2007\u20132008 country strategy and program update1 is based on four development objectives of the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China:  (i)  promoting  equitable  and  inclusive  growth,  (ii)  making  markets  work  better, \n(iii) improving the environment, and (iv) promoting regional cooperation. Promoting equitable and inclusive growth is the main \nstrategic focus for reducing poverty and income disparity. Despite the Government\u2019s ongoing efforts to control air pollution, \nenvironmental degradation continues to be a problem that counteracts economic progress. Rapid growth has outpaced \nenvironmental protection and many cities are still polluted. The Government recognizes the strong correlation between \npoverty and the environment. It has asked for the continued support of the Asian Development Bank in protecting and \nimproving the environment. This Investment Program will reduce energy demand in Guangdong, leading to stabilized current \npower generation.  \nB1. Poverty Analysis                                                        Poverty Classification:   General intervention \nEnergy efficiency investments lead to the following socioeconomic and environment benefits in addition to reduced energy \ncosts and emissions. \n \n1. Reduce Environmental Impacts. By the end of the Investment Program, carbon dioxide emissions will be reduced by \n415,560 tons/year, sulfur dioxide emissions by 4,795 tons/yr, nitrogen oxide emissions by 1,066 tons/year, and total \nsuspended particulates emissions by 1,785 tons/year. This will result in socioeconomic and environmental benefits to local \ncommunities. Improved air quality will reduce the morbidity and mortality rate of air-related diseases and associated medical \ncosts, and loss of healthy working days in Guangdong. The poor, elderly, children, and women, who have less coping \nresources and are more vulnerable, will benefit greatly from the reduction of air emissions.  \n \n2. Improve Environment of Private and Public Institutions. An improved environment for employees and users of facilities \nis a significant positive benefit of energy efficiency investments. Improvements in industrial and nonindustrial (public schools \nand hospitals) lighting, noise, and temperature and air quality conditions have all been found to result from efficiency retrofits. \nImproved lighting in schools has been found to result in improved test scores.  \n \n3. Develop the Energy Service Company (ESCO) Business Model. The Investment Program will demonstrate energy-\nsaving benefits from EPP subprojects and extend finance to ESCOs for developing the business model for middle users. \nConsidering the large opportunity for energy savings, Guangdong could have about 20 medium-sized ESCOs with about 100 \nemployees each, most in the skilled workers category. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n \nThe average electricity rate in Guangdong is much higher than the national average in recent years. For example, in 2001, the \naverage rate was CNY0.68 per kilowatt hour, compared with a national average of CNY0.51. For industrial users, the rates in \n2001 were higher than all other developed countries except Japan. The province suffered from substantial power shortages in \n2004 and 2005, requiring it to purchase power from other provinces in the southwest of the country, including the Hong Kong \nSpecial Administrative Region. Implementation of the Investment Program would help avoid large electricity price increases by \nreducing the amount of electricity purchased from other provinces.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006.

Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during project preparation. \nInterviews and site visits have been held with a number of large electricity end users and middle users (e.g., energy service \ncompanies and high-efficiency equipment manufacturers) on the development of EPP. The National Development and Reform \nCommission; Ministry of Finance; and Guangdong Provincial Economic and Trade Commission, Development and Reform \nCommission, Finance Bureau, State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, and Energy Conservation and \nMonitoring Center have been consulted. Guangdong provincial government will be the Executing Agency for the Investment \nProgram. Guangdong Finance Trust Company Ltd., which is owned by Guangdong provincial government, is responsible for \nthe financial activities such as fund management, loan disbursement, and collection.
