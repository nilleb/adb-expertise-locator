The proposed capacity development technical assistance (TA) is consistent with the \nSouth Asia regional cooperation strategy, 2011\u20132015 and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ncountry partnership strategy for Nepal, 2010\u20132012, both of which accord high priority to regional \nconnectivity and trade facilitation. It was conceptualized following consultations conducted for \nSouth Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) trade facilitation during October 2012\u2013\nMarch 2013. It was also included in the South Asia regional cooperation operations business \nplan, 2013-2015.1 \n2.  At meetings of the SASEC trade facilitation and transport working groups (TFTWG) in \n2010\u20132012, the governments of SASEC countries requested continued support from ADB for \nthe  SASEC  trade  facilitation.2 At  the  SASEC  TFTWG  meeting  in  Thimphu,  Bhutan,  on  8 \nNovember  2012,  SASEC  country  delegations  (i)  agreed  to  expand  assistance  to  trade \nfacilitation through additional TA to provide full support to ongoing initiatives and (ii) requested \nADB to explore the possibility of providing TA to respond to the trade facilitation needs of \nSASEC countries. All consulted parties agreed broadly on the expected impacts and outcomes \nof the TA and strongly support TA design and  proposed implementation. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3  \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  According  to  the World  Bank  Doing  Business  reports,  2006\u20132013,  Nepal  does  not \nfacilitate trade well.4 The country\u2019s rank fell from 136 in 2007 to 171 in 2012. Nepal\u2019s key trade \nfacilitation  indicators  underperform  the  average  in  South  Asia.  The  weak  performance  is \nattributed to a number of key factors. \n4.  Large number of trade documents. Preparing documents takes considerable time and \nconstitutes a major barrier to trade facilitation. In 2012, it took 11 documents and 41 days to \ncomplete normal export processing, at a cost of $1,975 per container. It took 11 documents and \n38 days to complete normal import processing, at a cost of $2,095 per container. In addition, \nNepal  has  yet  to  conform  to  accepted  standards  of  trade  documentation  specified  in  the \nInternational  Convention  on  the  Simplification  and  Harmonization  of  Customs  Procedures, \notherwise known as the Revised Kyoto Convention (RKC).  \n5.  Inadequate  customs  automation.  Nepal currently uses the Automated System for \nCustoms Data ++ for customs operations at 15 major customs offices and applies risk-based \ncustoms clearance at six major customs offices. However, the customs process is not fully \nautomated, and technical difficulties affect system operation. In addition, the current Informix \ndatabase is obsolete and needs to be migrated to a new system. Nepal needs a master plan for \ne-customs and customs automation. Currently, 70%\u201390% of cargoes are inspected at border \ncheckpoints. Risk-based inspection is generally not applied, except in a limited way at six land \nborder crossings. Most cargo must be physically inspected for lack of modern equipment to \nsupport the border clearance procedures.   \n6.  Lack of transparency and publicly available trade and custom-related rules. This \nlack is a nontariff barrier to trade with Nepal. Priorities of Nepal\u2019s private sector regarding trade \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013.

Washington. \n ", "2   \nfacilitation are therefore the timely and comprehensive publication of trade and custom rules \nand regulations, and their effective and transparent application. \n \n7.  Other behind border barriers. Other issues such as quarantine testing, clearing and \nfreight forwarding, insurance, terminal handling, and port services are critical nontariff barriers to \ntrade  in  Nepal.  It  is  therefore  important  to  comprehensively  assess  and  streamline  these \nnontariff barriers. \n8.  Nepal  has  taken  several  initiatives  to  facilitate  trade  such  as  applying  harmonized \nsystem codes for customs tariffs, adopting the World Trade Organization Customs Valuation \nAgreement, enacting the new Customs Act and associated rules and regulations, establishing \nthe Automated System for Customs Data ++ for clearance at 15 major customs offices, and \nintroducing risk-based customs clearance at six major customs offices. Nepal has constructed \nan inland container deport at Kakarbhitta, supported by an ADB loan. \n9.  Nepal actively participates in the SASEC TFTWG. Through the TFTWG, Nepal is taking \npart in an ADB-supported subregional trade facilitation program along with Bangladesh and \nBhutan. 1 The components of the program grant to Nepal include the following:  \n(i)  Supporting modern and effective customs administration. ADB is helping \nNepal (as well as Bangladesh and Bhutan) accede to the RKC, comply with its \nprovisions,  and  apply  the  Framework  of  Standards  to  Secure  and  Facilitate \nGlobal Trade.  \n(ii)  Streamlining regulations and procedures. ADB\u2019s support enhances Nepal\u2019s \nautomated customs management systems, which is important for establishing a \nnational single window.  \n(iii)  Improving  services  and  information  for  traders  and  investors.  ADB  is \nhelping SASEC governments implement reforms that will inform and respond to \nimporters and exporters more effectively, notably through electronic trade portals \nand the establishment of national trade facilitation committees. \nInitial experience in implementing the program in Nepal suggests that the government needs \nassistance in ensuring that these components are achieved, and in putting in place other key \nlegal, regulatory, and institutional and capacity requirements for customs modernization and \nreforms.2 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The expected impact of the TA is Nepal enjoying speedier and less costly trade, to be \nindicated  by  the  time  it  takes to  export  and  import. The  expected  outcome  will  be  better \nalignment  of  Nepalese  customs\u2019  procedures  and  practices  with  internationally  accepted \nstandards. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB approved in November 2012 SASEC Trade Facilitation Program loans and grants to Bangladesh, Bhutan, and \nNepal to help develop modern customs administrations, streamline regulations and procedures, and provide \nimproved services and information to traders. \n2  Bangladesh and Bhutan are also in need of resources and capacity to put into effect the reforms being promoted \nunder  the  SASEC  Trade  Facilitation  Program  loans  and  grants.  CDTA  support  is  also  being  planned  for \nBangladesh and Bhutan. \n ", "                                                                                                                                                       3  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will have five planned outputs: (i) consensus reached to accede to the RKC; (ii) \neffective operation of the automated customs management system; (iii) client service centers \nestablished; (iv) Customs Information Portal established, and (v) agreed business plan for the \nFour-Year Customs Reform and Modernization Strategy and Action Plan, 2013\u20132017.  \n12.  Consensus Reached to Accede to the Revised Kyoto Convention. The TA will help \nthe Government of Nepal to assess the regulatory impact of proposed amendments to laws and \nregulations.  To  complement  regulatory  reform  related  to  RKC  accession,  the  TA  will  also \nsupport activities to raise key stakeholders\u2019 awareness of the RKC, in collaboration with the \nWorld Customs Organization (WCO).  \n13.  Effective operation of the automated customs management system. The TA will \nhelp provide technical training to Nepalese customs officials on issues related to customs \nautomation and a national single window. \n14.  Client  service  centers  established. The TA will support establishing client service \ncenters at selected border points to facilitate information sharing and other interaction between \nborder agencies and traders.  \n15.  Customs  Information  Portal  established.  Information  on  trade  and  customs \nregulations is critical for trade facilitation. The TA will help Nepal share accurate and detailed \ninformation on trade- and customs-related laws, regulations, procedures, and documentation. \nThese documents will be made publically available in Nepal\u2019s Customs Information Portal.  \n16.  Agreed  business  plan  for  the  Four-Year  Customs  Reform  and  Modernization \nStrategy and Action Plan. Nepal\u2019s Four-Year Customs Reform and Modernization Strategy \nand Action Plan, 2013\u20132017 has been approved. The strategy identifies priority activities to be \nsupported  and  implemented  with  possible  support  from  other  development  partners.  It  is \ntherefore important for the Nepal Department of Customs to develop a business plan that \nincludes resource mobilization and the implementation of priority activities.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.6 million, of which $1.5 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff and office accommodation, and \nother in-kind contributions.  The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months from September 2013 to August 2015. The \nADB  South  Asia  Department  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  the  Nepal  Department  of \nCustoms the implementing agency. ADB will work closely with the WCO and other international \norganizations,  such  as  the  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  in \nimplementing the TA, particularly for activities under outputs 1 and 2.  \n19.  On 25 January 2013, the South Asia Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination \nDivision, the executing agency\u2019s focal point for the TA, and the WCO Asia Pacific Regional \n ", "4   \nOffice for Capacity Building met in Bangkok for a 1-day planning retreat.1 The ADB mission and \nthe WCO agreed on six themes for capacity building: general annex provisions of the RKC, the \nSAFE Framework of Standards to Secure and Facilitate Global Trade (SAFE Framework), \nauthorized  economic  operators,  risk  management,  post  clearance  audit,  and  time  release \nstudy2.  \n20.  Building on a training needs assessment workshop on 28 March 2013, the following \ntraining workshops have been identified for 2013: (i) a regional knowledge-sharing workshop; (ii) \na  regional  workshop  on  the  WCO  compendium  on  national  single  windows  for  SASEC \ncountries, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives; and (iii) a regional workshop on a time release study for \nBangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. WCO officials will share their semiannual capacity-building \nprograms with the South Asia Regional Coordinating and Country Division on a regular basis to \nbetter synchronize the training programs of both institutions. \n21.  The TA will require 58.5 person-months of international consultancy and 96 person-\nmonths of national consultancy, consisting of (i) 27 person-months each from international \ncustoms and trade facilitation specialists; (ii) 36 person-months each from legal and trade \nfacilitation specialists; (iii) 24 person-months from web and content managers; and (iv) 4.5 \nperson-months from resource persons who will participate in capacity building on international \nbest practice, coordinating development partner activities and trade facilitation, and supporting \nthe preparation of a regulatory impact study. Consultants will be engaged by ADB as individuals \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time \nto time). The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. All procurement and \ndisbursements under the TA will follow ADB Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from \ntime to time) and the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time).  \n22.  The TA will be monitored and coordinated principally through meetings of the SASEC \nTFTWG and the SASEC customs subgroup, as well as through national and regional meetings \nheld under TA auspices.3 TA outputs will be evaluated by the South Asia Department through \nannual TA implementation review missions, assisted by the Nepal Resident Mission.  \n23.  Best practices and lessons from the TA will be documented in the progress reports \nsubmitted to the SASEC TFTWG and posted on the SASEC website (www.sasec.asia). Good \npractices  and  lessons  learned  will  also  be  reported  during  meetings  of  ADB\u2019s  Regional \nCooperation and Integration Community of Practice. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,500,000  to  the \nGovernment of Nepal to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction \nfor  Supporting  Participation  in  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  Trade \nFacilitation Program, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n1  The WCO Asia Pacific Regional Office for Capacity Building was represented by Yoshihiro Kosaka, the head of the \noffice;  Shigeaki  Katsu,  his  deputy;  and  Cheng  Jing,  technical  attach\u00e9.
