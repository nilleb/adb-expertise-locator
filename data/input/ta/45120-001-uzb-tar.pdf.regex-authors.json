INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  Uzbekistan  has  expressed  its  commitment  to  developing  solar \nenergy and becoming the regional knowledge hub for solar technologies. The government \nrequested the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in promoting solar energy \ndevelopment in December 2010.  \n \n2.  A  consultation  mission  was  fielded  in  March  2011  where  the  government  and  the \nmission  agreed,  through  the  signing  of  a  memorandum  of  understanding,  on  the  scope, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  the  consultant\u2019s  terms  of \nreference of the proposed policy and advisory technical assistance (TA).1 The content of the TA \nwas reconfirmed during a technical assistance fact-finding mission fielded in May 2011. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Uzbekistan is endowed with rich coal, oil, and gas reserves. The country has about 1.8 \ntrillion cubic meters of proven natural gas reserves, 590 million barrels of proven oil reserves, \nand about 3.0 billion tons of recoverable coal reserves. However, Uzbekistan\u2019s primary energy \ndemand is projected to increase from 48.5 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 2006 to 72.6 \nMtoe  in  2030,  an  annual  growth  rate  of  1.8%.  To  conserve  its  depleting  resources,  the \ngovernment, in its Welfare Improvement Strategy,2 called for reduced use of natural gas through \nthe introduction of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.3  \n \n4.  The most promising source of renewable energy in Uzbekistan is solar energy. The \ncountry has abundant solar irradiance (annual total global horizontal irradiance) of 1,400\u20131,800 \nkilowatt-hours per square meter, which is comparable to leading countries in solar energy such \nas Germany and Spain. In fact, Uzbekistan was selected as the optimum location in the former \nSoviet Union to establish a solar furnace to conduct material  science research in a high-\ntemperature environment created by concentrating solar energy. With such foundation, the \ngovernment aims not only to develop solar energy but also to become the region\u2019s knowledge \nhub for solar technologies. \n \n5.  Despite its solar resource potential, a pool of solar energy experts, and abundant land \non which to develop solar energy, limited exposure to modern solar technology and applications \nhave impeded Uzbekistan from effectively harnessing its solar resources. In addition, it does not \nhave sufficient reliable solar irradiance data or an enabling environment for such development. \nThe TA will contribute to the deployment of solar energy in Uzbekistan by removing such \nimpediments and by preparing feasibility studies for both pilot and commercial solar energy \nprojects.  \n \n6.  The harnessing of indigenous solar energy as a result of the TA will diversify the energy \nmix and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the thermal power plants that make up 86% of \nthe country\u2019s installed generation capacity. Environmental and health benefits are also expected \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 June 2011. \n2  Government of Uzbekistan. 2007.

Total energy supply in tons of oil equivalent per \n$1,000 of gross domestic product is 2.20 for Uzbekistan, whereas the world average is 0.30. It is extremely high \neven compared with India (0.75) and the People\u2019s Republic of China (0.81). The figure for Japan is 0.10 and the \nUnited States of America is 0.19.

Since the power grid in Central \nAsia connects the countries in the region, the benefit of solar energy deployment in Uzbekistan \nis expected to extend beyond its borders. \n \n7.  The policy and advisory TA is expected to complement the ongoing small-scale capacity \ndevelopment TA4 approved on 15 August 2011. Under the small-scale capacity development \nTA, a modern solar energy institute will be designed and the capacity of solar energy experts \ndeveloped. The institute will be the knowledge hub for solar energy. It will draft laws and \nregulations  related  to  renewable  energy,  provide  assistance  to  solar  energy  project \ndevelopment, and transfer solar technology to local industries in Uzbekistan as well as in \nneighboring countries with rich solar resources. The institute is expected to be established out \nof the existing Scientific-Production Association on Solar Physics, which is the implementing \nagency for both the policy and advisory TA and the small-scale capacity development TA. The \ngovernment will allocate the necessary budget to establish the solar energy institute.  The policy \nand advisory TA will provide capacity development opportunities. Ultimately, it is envisaged that \nthe  synergy  between  the  policy  and  advisory  TA  and  the  ongoing  small-scale  capacity \ndevelopment TA will result in the creation of a solar industry in Uzbekistan, bringing vast \neconomic benefits to the local economy and beyond.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA will promote solar energy development in Uzbekistan through (i) creating an \nenabling environment for solar energy development, (ii) on-site solar resource assessment, and \n(iii) solar energy project preparation.  \n \n9.  The TA impact will be an increase in environmentally sustainable and efficient power \ngeneration, with installed capacity of renewable energy increasing by 100 megawatts within 5 \nyears of completion of the TA. The outcome will be increased readiness for solar application in \nUzbekistan\u2014at least one commercial-scale solar power plant is committed for development by \n2013, and solar energy will be used for off-grid applications by 2013. The projects prepared \nthrough the TA will be considered by ADB for financing through both sovereign and private \nsector operations. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will have the following activities and outputs:  \n \n(i)  create  an  enabling  environment  for  solar  energy  development  through \nrecommendations  on  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  reforms  conducive  to  the \nintroduction and development of solar energy and to private sector participation; \n(ii)  formulate a solar energy development road map;  \n(iii)  confirm solar resource availability through on-site solar irradiance measurement; \nproduce  satellite-model-based  national  solar  resource  map  with  overlay  of \ngeographical  information  system  data  to  screen  for  potential  solar  energy \ndevelopment sites.  For up to six sites, create satellite-model-based 11-year data \nseries corrected using 12 months of on-site measurement data; \n                                                \n4 ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Design and Strengthening of the Solar \nEnergy Institute. Manila \n ", "  3 \n(iv)  prepare up to six feasibility studies for solar energy projects including at least two \npilot-scale demonstration projects and two commercial-scale projects.  \n \n11.  The  projects  are  to  include  photovoltaic  and  concentrated  solar  thermal  power \ntechnologies, integrated solar combined cycle technology, and other distributed uses of solar \nenergy.  The feasibility studies will include project design documents for the Clean Development \nMechanism or other required documentation for carbon financing applications. The scope of \nworks of the TA is the first of its kind in Uzbekistan, and it is expected that the country\u2019s capacity \nto develop solar energy will be strengthened through its implementation. \n \n12.  For on-site solar irradiance measurement, six complete meteorological stations with \nrotating shadowband pyranometers will be procured and installed by the consultants in up to six \npotential project sites. In one complete meteorological station an air transmissivity sensor5 and \npyrheliometer with tracker will be procured and installed to calibrate the rotating shadowband \npyranometers. In addition, one set of specialized computers will be procured for data collection \nand analysis. All equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time). All equipment procured by the consultants under the TA \nwill be handed over to the implementing agency upon delivery. All disbursements under the TA \nwill be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \n \n13.  It is a major assumption that the government will remain engaged in solar  energy \ndevelopment for the relatively long implementation period of the TA. A major risk is that reliable \ncontinuous data are not obtained through on-site measurement. To mitigate this risk, proper \ninstallation, maintenance, and frequent data verification will be conducted. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($1,000,000 from TASF-IV  and  $500,000 \nfrom TASF-other sources). The government will provide counterpart contribution in the form of \nland  and  required  works  (e.g.,  leveling,  security  fences)  for  the  installation  of  the  on-site \nmeasurement stations, telecommunications cost for data logging, daily maintenance of on-site \nmeasurement stations, counterpart staff, counterpart staff per diems, office space and other in-\nkind contributions. The government will also guarantee that all equipment purchased under the \nTA and brought into Uzbekistan will be exempted from all forms of taxes and duties. The cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency because development of solar \nenergy is a national strategic priority, not only for the supply of energy but also to create a local \nindustry  around  solar  energy  to  boost  economic  activity.  The  ministry  will  supervise  the \nimplementation of the TA and coordinate with the activities of the separate small-scale capacity \ndevelopment TA. The Ministry of Finance will also be responsible for evaluating and assessing \nthe  outputs  of  the  policy  and  advisory  TA.  The  Scientific-Production  Association  on  Solar \nPhysics will be the implementing agency. The association is responsible for the operation of the \nsolar furnace and supervising the various research institutions engaged in the use of solar \n                                                \n5 Transmissivity is a measure of how much light passes through a substance (such as glass or air).  Air transmissivity \nsensors are used to monitor solar radiation, weather, visibility, or pollution. \n ", "4   \nenergy,  including  the  Physical-Technical  Institute  and  Material  Science  Institute.  The \nassociation will assign counterpart staff to work with the consultants on a daily basis. The \nMinistry of Finance and Scientific-Production Association on Solar Physics  will establish a \nsteering committee to provide guidance and oversee implementation of the TA. \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 21 months from January 2012 to September 2013. It \nwill require 40 person-months (12 experts) of international and 40 person-months (8 experts) of \nnational consultants. Required positions include a solar development expert; solar policy, laws, \nand regulations expert; solar resource assessment expert; photovoltaic expert; concentrated \nsolar thermal power expert; and integrated solar combined cycle expert. The terms of reference \nfor consultants are in Appendix 3. ADB will engage a consulting firm in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The firm will be \nrecruited through the quality- and cost-based selection method using a full technical proposal. \nThe quality\u2013cost ratio will be 90:10 as the TA requires a high level of specialized technical \nexpertise.  \n \n17.  The outputs of the TA will be disseminated through workshops and through the Asia \nSolar Energy Forum. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.
