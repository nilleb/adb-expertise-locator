The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) through the Office of the \nMountain-River-Lake Development Committee of Jiangxi Province (MRLDO) requested capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Natural \nDisaster Risk Management in the Southern Mountain Area in Jiangxi.1 The TA was included in \nADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2013\u20132015  for  the  PRC.2 A  TA  reconnaissance \nmission was conducted during 21\u201324 October 2013. Government concurrence with the impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference  was  obtained  in  an  email  dated  16  January  2014.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  ADB\u2019s Draft Operational Plan for Integrated Disaster Risk Management, 2014\u20132020 \nstates  that  disaster  risk  now  presents  one  of  the  most  serious  threats  to  inclusive  and \nsustainable  socioeconomic  development  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.4 ADB  is  preparing  the \noperational plan to help its developing member countries strengthen their disaster resilience \nthrough  (i)  the  integration  of  disaster  risk  reduction  into  development,  (ii)  addressing  the \nintersection between disaster risk management (DRM) and climate change adaptation, and (iii) \ndeveloping disaster risk financing capability. In the southern mountain area of Jiangxi Province \n(hereafter  referred  to  as  the  Gannan  Mountain  area),  climate  change  and  agricultural \nconversion, among others, are putting significant pressure on the environment and natural \nresource base. Jiangxi Province is one of the poorest provinces in the PRC; and livelihoods and \nsustainable development are at risk from natural and anthropogenic hazards, including floods, \ndroughts, severe storms, and landslides. Environmental and anthropogenic hazards interact and \nrequire an integrated approach to reduce disaster risk.  \n \n3.  The Gannan Mountain area of Jiangxi Province has 8.4 million inhabitants, with an \naverage household size of 3.8 people; and a rural per capita net income of CNY4,182.5 Poverty \nrates in the Gannan Mountain area are quite high; rural per capita annual incomes are 28% \nlower than the provincial rural average of CNY5,789, and only 27% of the provincial urban \naverage of CNY15,481. The regional domestic product for this area is CNY112 billion, and was \nincreasing at an annual rate of 13.8% as of 2011. The headwaters of the Ganjiang River are \nlocated  in  the  Gannan  Mountain  area,  and  the  river  supports  agriculture,  fisheries,  local \ntransportation, local ecosystems, and freshwater needs. The river feeds into the PRC\u2019s largest \nfreshwater lake (Poyang Lake), which is an area of global importance for migratory birds. The \nregion is biologically diverse, an important source of tungsten and other rare earth metals, and a \nglobally important production area for navel oranges. Navel orange plantations cover 110,993 \nhectares in the Gannan Mountain area, and are an important part of the local economy. \n \n4.  Recent disasters have had enormous impacts on the local economy, infrastructure, and \nenvironmental quality, and on people\u2019s wellbeing. Landslides in 2009 destroyed more than \n10,000 buildings, and 600,000 people were directly affected. In 2010, there were 28 heavy snow \n                                                \n1  The MRLDO is a government think tank for the Development Committee of the Jiangxi provincial government, and \nresponsible for strategic research and demonstration of sustainable development. \n2  ADB. 2013. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2013\u20132015. Manila.  \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the ADB website on 14 March 2014.  \n4  ADB. 2014. Draft Operational Plan for Integrated Disaster Risk Management, 2014\u20132020. Manila. The draft \noperational plan specifically considers hazards to physical assets in assessing disaster risk.  \n5  Data provided by the MRLDO from local government statistics, and the Jiangxi Statistical Yearbook 2011. \n ", " 2 \nevents, a hailstorm, and numerous severe storms. According to local government experts, the \nagriculture sector, particularly navel orange plantations, are highly vulnerable to natural hazards \nsuch as severe storms, drought, and freezing. About 10% of the navel orange crop is lost each \nyear due to natural hazards, with economic losses of approximately CNY4 billion. Crop failures \ndue to freezing are the most costly. Although no current data are available, local communities \nare  at  high  risk  from  landslides  and  flooding  in  addition  to  economic  losses  from  crops. \nEarthquakes are also a risk, based on work conducted previously by the MRLDO under a \nUnited Nations Development Program project.6 \n \n5.  The  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan  of  the  Mountain-River-Lake  Development  Program  lists \ndisaster prevention and reduction in the drainage basin as a priority. The PRC has developed a \ncomprehensive  system  of  DRM,  including  prevention,  reduction,  preparation,  relief,  and \nreconstruction. However, DRM currently emphasizes generalities, strategies, and procedures \nrather than case studies, practical applications, and operations. DRM is very compartmentalized, \nwith  knowledge  concentrated  at  the  top  levels  of  provincial  and  central  government;  and \nfocused on institutional and/or organizational aspects of DRM and recovery following disasters. \nDisaster warnings from the central and/or provincial governments are transmitted through cell \nphone calls to specific individuals in the villages considered to be at risk. The MRLDO seeks to \naddress these issues in part through (i) an expansion of community involvement in DRM, (ii) \npolicy  recommendations  to  improve  DRM,  and  (iii)  the  development  of  specific  technical \nsolutions to reduce risks and mitigate the impacts of disasters on agriculture-based livelihoods \nin the Gannan Mountain area. The TA will provide a framework to identify and select effective, \nsustainable, and feasible actions to mitigate risks to local communities. \n \n6.  The TA will build on recommendations and lessons from previous experiences with the \nDeutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Internationale  Zusammenarbeit,  the  ProVention  Consortium,  the \nUnited Nations, the PRC\u2019s early warning systems for agricultural freezing in Gannan, and ADB \nstudies. Lessons include the importance of stakeholder participation in operationalization and \ndisaster prevention, and the role of early warning in reducing economic losses. Preliminary \nexperience with a pilot forest insurance initiative for natural risk mitigation in the ongoing Jiangxi \nSustainable  Forest  Ecosystem  Development  Project  will  be  used  as  a  foundation  for  the \nassessment  of  potential  disaster  insurance.7 The  TA  will  complement  community  activities \npiloted in one village in 2008 by the MRLDO. The pilot focused on increasing the capacity of \nfarmers to acquire, understand, and apply meteorological information to disaster management. \nActivities included participatory rural appraisals, socioeconomic and environmental surveys, and \ncapability building. In cooperation with the village council, an information transfer network was \nenhanced by setting up an information assistance group. The scope of the pilot was limited, but \nis nevertheless relevant. The policy and technical recommendations from this TA will be used by \nlocal communities, state-owned enterprises, farmers\u2019 cooperatives, and the private sector to \nreduce disaster risk; and will support decision making by the MRLDO. The findings may be used \nto develop a potential project proposal. \n \n                                                \n6  G. Wu. 1998.

The outcome of the TA will be improved policies and increased \nlocal capacity in the Gannan Mountain area to manage disaster risk and adapt to climate \nchange. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The  expected  outputs  of  the  TA  will  include  the  following:  (i)  natural  disaster  risk \nassessment of the Gannan Mountain area; (ii) an integrated DRM (IDRM) plan prepared for the \nGannan Mountain area; and (iii) training and capacity development for IDRM in the Gannan \nMountain area.  The TA will specifically develop an IDRM policy brief as a knowledge product. \n \n9.  Output 1: Natural disaster risk assessment in the Gannan Mountain area. This will \ninclude  (i)  review  and  analyze  current  environmental  and  socioeconomic  data  and reports \navailable for the Gannan Mountain area; (ii) identify environmental hazards and their impacts, \nincluding projected climate change impacts, landslides, earthquakes, droughts, and floods; (iii) \nreview the spatial distribution of disaster risks given locations of communities and economic \nactivities, particularly navel orange agricultural crops; (iv) prioritize disaster risks based on \ntechnical criteria, including magnitude of impacts and potential for mitigation; (v) review current \nland use management practices that increase or decrease disaster risks; and (vi) (vii) conduct \nfield studies and assess current vulnerability to disaster risks. \n \n10.  Output 2:  An IDRM plan prepared for the Gannan Mountain area. Activities will \ninclude (i) review the past effectiveness of DRM, and the current DRM policy framework and \nprocedures, identifying gaps in response plans and overlapping responsibilities or authority; and \nidentify issues and constraints and/or barriers; (ii) identify appropriate mitigation activities and \nspecific  best  land  use  management  practices  to  reduce  disaster  risks,  particularly  in  the \nagriculture sector; (iii) identification of effective IDRM practices, policies, and regulations; (iv) \nconduct a participatory strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis of \nIDRM capacity; (v) conduct financial analyses to determine potential implementation costs for \nIDRM, including disaster risk reduction insurance in the agriculture sector; (vi) prioritize IDRM \npractices, policies, and regulations based on the financial analyses, surveys, and data inputs \nfrom Output 1; (vii) conduct consultations and a workshop to discuss preliminary results, and \nfinalize identification of priority activities; and (viii) prepare a community-based IDRM plan, \nincluding  identifying  adaptation  measures  to  reduce  risks  in  the  agriculture  sector; \nrecommendations for changes in specific management practices and IDRM practices, policies, \nand regulations; a detailed work plan; and a budget.   \n \n11.  Output 3:  Training and capacity development for IDRM in the Gannan Mountain \narea. This will include (i) development of IDRM training materials; (ii) conduct of training in \ndisaster risk prevention, preparedness, and risk management to develop the capacity of local \ncommunities and government staff; (iii) provincial study tour for community members to see \nparticipatory DRM in the PRC; (iv) development of an IDRM policy knowledge product that \naddresses  gaps  and  opportunities  and  issues  identified  in  Outputs  1  and  2;  (v)  conduct \nworkshops  to  inform  and  jointly  review  TA  results;  and  (vi)  preparation  of  a  final  report \nsummarizing key results.   \n \n ", " 4 \n12.  The major assumptions considered include the following: (i) communities will adopt \nrecommendations from the community-based IDRM plan, (ii) there is sufficient understanding \nand willingness to cooperate between community members and local government institutions, \nand (iii) local communities are interested in participating in IDRM. \n \n13.  The major key risks considered include the following: (i) funding is insufficient to fully \nimplement  the  recommendations;  (ii)  there  are  competing  priorities  and  conflicts  regarding \nnatural resource use; and (iii) turnover of staff and participants delay TA implementation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $420,000, of which $350,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \n  \n15.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of (i) remuneration and per \ndiem for counterpart staff, including secretarial assistance and translation services; (ii) office \naccommodation and supplies; (ii) domestic transportation; (iii) relevant government data and \nstudies for the consultants\u2019 use; (iv) meeting and/or office facilities (including support for local \nphone calls, fax, internet, computers and printing), geographical information system maps, and \nother support to the consultants, as required; and (v) other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The MRLDO will be the executing agency for the TA. A TA management office (TMO) \nwill be established in the MRLDO\u2019s International Cooperation Division to carry out day-to-day \nTA operations. The director of the MRLDO\u2019s International Cooperation Division will serve as the \nTMO  executive  director  and  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  operational  matters  and \ntechnical collaboration with the consultants. The MRLDO will provide office space, access to \ncommunications and copiers, and logistical support for TA implementation. The TMO executive \ndirector will also be responsible for submitting reimbursement claims for approved expenditures \nfor equipment, data, maps, technical translation, and logistical support for training (including \nlocal study tour), seminars, and conferences.   \n \n17.  The MRLDO will ensure relevant offices and departments\u2014including the departments of \nagriculture, forestry, land resources, mining, and water resources; the meteorology bureau; and \nothers at city and provincial levels\u2014participate in meetings and workshops during the inception, \ninterim, midterm, and final stages of TA implementation.  \n \n18.  The TA has a tentative starting date of 1 July 2014 and end date of 30 September 2015. \nThe consultants will submit an inception report to ADB within 6 weeks of TA commencement, \nand an interim report 7 months after TA commencement. A draft final report will be submitted to \nADB 12 months after TA commencement, and a final report at TA conclusion. The inception, \ninterim, and draft final reports will be subject to review by ADB and the government. All reports \nwill  be  written  in  English  and  translated  into  Chinese.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3.   \n  \n19.  The TA will be carried out by a team of consultants to be engaged through a firm, which \nwill provide 6.75 person-months of international and 11 person-months of national consulting \nservices. Two international specialists (team leader and DRM specialist, and a climate-smart \nagriculture specialist) and three national specialists (deputy team leader and DRM specialist, a \nhydrology  and  climate change  specialist,  and a finance  specialist)  will  be  required  for TA \n ", "  5 \nimplementation (Appendix 3). ADB will engage the consultants following its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The consulting firm will be selected \nusing biodata technical proposals and the quality- and cost-based selection, with a quality\u2013cost \nweighting ratio of 90:10 given the high technical complexity. Procurement under the TA will \nfollow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and equipment \npurchased will be turned over to the executing agency upon TA completion. Disbursements \nunder the TA will be in line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). ADB will reimburse the TMO for approved logistical support costs \nfor equipment, data, maps, technical translation, training, seminars, and conferences. ADB will \nundertake  intensive  review  and  supervision  by  fielding  missions  at  critical  stages  of  TA \nimplementation\u2014particularly inception, midterm, and final reviews; and by extending regular \nsupport from the ADB headquarters and the PRC Resident Mission.     \n \n20.  The TA results will be disseminated through project reports, TA workshops, and media \nreleases by ADB and the MRLDO. An IDRM policy brief will be developed and disseminated in \nhard copy by ADB, the PRC Resident Mission, and the MRLDO; and will be posted on the ADB \nwebsite. An outcome evaluation will follow ADB guidelines, and will be provided to the MRLDO. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n21.
