The Government of the Philippines requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide  technical  assistance  (TA) to  strengthen  capacity  of the  (i)  National  Economic  and \nDevelopment Authority (NEDA) for timely and quality appraisal of public\u2013private partnership \n(PPP) projects; and (ii) the Department of Finance (DOF) for management of fiscal cost of the \ngrowing PPP portfolio.1 The TA is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132016, \nand  is  included  in  the  Philippines  country  operations  business  plan,  2014\u20132016.2 ADB \nconducted a fact-finding mission on 2\u20136 September 2013, which agreed with the government on \nthe TA\u2019s objective, scope, implementation arrangements, and financing plan. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Inadequate  infrastructure  a  critical  constraint  to  growth.  Institutional  and  fiscal \nspace constraints have held back the ability of the public sector to properly maintain the existing \ninfrastructure and build new infrastructure to cope with the Philippines\u2019 demographic (1.9% \naverage annual population growth in 2000\u20132012) and geographic (archipelagic and highly prone \nto natural disasters) challenges. External shocks and governance challenges have negatively \naffected private sector investment commitments in infrastructure, which fell from a peak of     \n15.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1997 to 2% in 2000\u20132012.4 In 2013, the government \nannounced its intention to increase public infrastructure investments to 5% of GDP in 2016 to \nbring  the  Philippines  on  par  with  the  regional  average. 5  Despite  the  country\u2019s  mixed \nperformance since starting with PPPs in early 1990s, the momentum in the government\u2019s \nrevenue and expenditure reforms as well as the government\u2019s shift from a deal-based (i.e., \nreliance on unsolicited projects) toward a program-based approach (i.e., reliance on a pipeline \nof solicited and properly prepared projects) in PPPs suggest that the country could meet its \ninvestment targets.  \n \n3.  Progress in public\u2013private partnership program. The pipeline of PPP projects grew \nfrom 11 projects in November 2010 to 51 in January 2014. Four expressway, two classroom, \none light rail, and one hospital project have been awarded with a total estimated investment of \n$3.4 billion. Six PPP projects for a total of $3.4 billion are at the bidding stage, and another four \nprojects for $1.4 billion are undergoing the government approval process. Twenty projects are \nunder preparation and 13 under conceptualization.6 Overall, a more robust pipeline of quality \nPPP projects has emerged, raising the likelihood of sustainability of the country\u2019s PPP program. \n                                                \n1  The government requested TA support in April 2013 during the midterm review of ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance \nto the Republic of the Philippines for Strengthening Public-Private Partnerships in the Philippines. Manila (TA 7796-\nPHI). The ongoing capacity development TA focuses on strengthening the Philippine PPP Center and setting up \nthe Project Development and Monitoring Facility for PPP project preparation and transaction. It is cofinanced by the \ngovernments of Australia and Canada. For details, see ADB. 2012. Major Change in Technical Assistance: \nStrengthening Public\u2013Private Partnerships in the Philippines. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2013. Philippines: Country Operations Business Plan, 2014\u20132016. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 April 2014. \n4  Private sector investment commitment in a year means the total amount of fiscally closed PPP contracts in that \nyear  as  reported  in  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Private  Participation  in  Infrastructure  Database  (World  Bank. \nhttp://www.ppi.worldbank.org (accessed on 24 January 2014). \n5  Overall, the country\u2019s underinvestment in infrastructure is about 2% of GDP. See G. M. Llanto. 2012. The Impact of \nInfrastructure on Agricultural Productivity. Discussion Paper Series. No. 2012-12. Makati City: Philippine Institute of \nDevelopment Studies. See also ADB. 2007. Philippines: Critical Development Constraints. Country Diagnostic \nStudies. Manila. \n6  Of the 38 projects that are at post-conceptualization stage, 27 projects have received preparation and transaction \nadvisory support from the Project Development and Monitoring Facility set up under the ongoing TA (footnote 1). \n ", "2   \n4.  Improvements in public\u2013private partnership enabling environment. In May 2013, \nthe presidential executive order (i) established the PPP Governing Board as the government\u2019s \ncentral PPP policy decision-making body, (ii) institutionalized the Project Development and \nMonitoring Facility (PDMF) Committee, (iii) confirmed the PPP Center as a member of the \nTechnical Board of the Investment Coordination Committee (ICC), and (iv) operationalized the \nmonitoring  dimension  of  the  PDMF  to  support  government  agencies  in  PPP  contract \nmanagement.7 In the same month, the NEDA issued revised joint venture guidelines enhancing \ntransparency of processing of such projects by subjecting them to review by the ICC. In the \n2014 General Appropriations Act under the Unprogrammed Fund\u2019s Risk Management Program, \nP20 billion was authorized to cover contingent liabilities arising from PPP contracts that could \nmaterialize in 2014.8 In December 2013, the ICC approved changes to the process of appraising \nPPP projects by assigning (i) the PPP Center as secretariat to coordinate appraisal of PPP \nprojects presented to the ICC and carry out review of the value for money, commercial viability, \nbankability, and financial structuring; (ii) the NEDA for appraisal of socioeconomic aspects; and \n(iii) the DOF for appraisal of risk allocation, financial viability, and fiscal sustainability of PPP \nprojects. 9 \n \n5.  Institutional changes. The NEDA\u2019s rationalization plan approved in June 2013 includes \n(i) creation of a value risk analysis and infrastructure regulation division under the NEDA\u2019s \ninfrastructure staff to conduct value, risk, and price escalation analyses and contract review of \nPPP projects; and (ii) restructuring of the program formulation division of the public investment \nstaff  into  an  investment  programming  division  to  serve  as  focal  division  on  PPP  project \nprocessing for ICC and NEDA Board review. The DOF has set up an interagency contingent \nliability monitoring group led by the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr). This group is operational and \nleads the contingent liability analysis for the government\u2019s annual fiscal risk statements. The \nBTr\u2019s rationalization plan submitted to the Department of Budget and Management for approval \nproposes the establishment of a Debt and Risk Management Office (DRMO) and a contingent \nliability division within this office with six permanent staff. The DRMO will take over the functions \nof the Debt and Risk Management Division set up in May 2009 under  an ADB-supported \nDevelopment Policy Support Program Cluster. The DOF staff assigned to the Debt and Risk \nManagement  Division  were  transferred  to  the  BTr  for  absorption  into  the  DRMO  upon  its \nformalization. The national treasurer will be the overall head of the liability management cluster \nof the DOF, including PPP-related contingent liabilities. \n \n6.  Increasing  number  of  public\u2013private  partnership  projects.  Before  bidding,  PPP \nprojects need to be approved by  the ICC, which also approves government-funded public \ninvestment projects larger than P1 billion. The number and complexity of PPP projects\u2014in \naddition to the mainstream of NEDA-reviewed projects that are funded from government budget \nand official development assistance\u2014submitted for review by the NEDA has been increasing \nsince 2011. This poses an additional challenge to the ability of NEDA staff to conduct timely and \nquality  appraisal  of  PPP  projects.10 Similarly,  the  rising  number  of  PPP  projects  under \n                                                \n7  Executive Order 136 (dated 28 May 2013). Per this order, the PPP Center is an attached agency to NEDA for \nbudgetary purposes and administrative supervision and reports directly to the PPP Governing Board. This Board is \nin charge of the PPP enabling environment and the ICC is in charge of approval of individual PPP projects. \n8  Amounts authorized under the unprogrammed fund do not represent appropriation of funds. Hence, such amounts \ndo not add to the budget deficit at budget approval. Should the events associated with the purpose of authorization \noccur, then the government may fund expenses to cover the cost of such events. In that case, these materialized \nexpenses would add to the budget deficit. The authorization is given for 1 budget year only. \n9  Socioeconomic analysis entails a prerequisite analysis of the technical, institutional, environmental, and financial \naspects of the project, as they may be relevant to the socioeconomic analysis. \n10 In  the  NEDA\u2019s  Reference  Manual  on  Project  Development  and  Evaluation,  the  term  \u201cevaluation\u201d  refers  to \nassessment at pre-investment stage of the project\u2019s socioeconomic and financial viability as well as alignment with \n ", "  3 \npreparation and implementation poses an additional challenge to the DOF\u2019s ability to properly \nand promptly identify and value contingent liabilities during project appraisal and implementation. \nThe  government\u2019s  institutional  arrangements  on  managing  PPP  fiscal  cost  also  need \nstrengthening: the interagency contingent liability monitoring group and the DOF need support \nin (i) clarifying public sector accounting for PPP direct and contingent liabilities; (ii) designing \nfiscal rules to adequately manage PPP costs shouldered by the government; (iii) establishing \nfunctional systems, processes, and procedures for the contingent liability monitoring group; and \n(iv) developing sustainable funding options for contingent liabilities and viability gap funding for \nthe government\u2019s consideration. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA\u2019s impact will be increased and fiscally sustainable infrastructure investments \nthrough PPPs. The outcome of the TA will be improved government\u2019s appraisal and sustainable \nmanagement of PPP projects.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will achieve its outcome through three outputs: strengthening the government\u2019s (i) \ncapacity in PPP project appraisal; (ii) capacity in management of contingent liabilities arising \nfrom PPP projects; and (iii) institutional framework for PPP fiscal cost management. Output 1 is \nthe NEDA\u2019s component, while outputs 2 and 3 comprise the DOF\u2019s component.11 \n \n9.  Output  1.  The  TA  will  strengthen  NEDA\u2019s  capacity  in  appraising  PPP  projects  by \nproviding NEDA staff with on-the-job advisory support on actual PPP projects being reviewed by \nthem.12 The TA offers immediate support to the NEDA to implement its rationalization plan and \nto subject at least two PPP projects to value analysis on the basis of guidelines developed \nunder the Australia\u2013Philippines Partnership for Economic Governance Reforms Program in \n2010. On the basis of this advisory support, the TA will support delivery of project-based or \ntopic-focused (e.g., on the subject of value for money assessment) trainings to interagency \nteams comprising staff from the NEDA, DOF, Department of Budget and Management, PPP \nCenter, relevant implementing agencies, and regulators. To ensure knowledge transfer, the TA \nwill support the development of discussion notes on the lessons learned and ways forward, and \nconduct stakeholder workshops in the middle and at the end of the TA. \n \n                                                                                                                                                       \nthe country development strategy. At the pre-investment stage, therefore, the term \u201cevaluation\u201d actually means \n\u201cappraisal.\u201d \n11 With the TA\u2019s focus on PPP project appraisal and fiscal cost management areas, most phases of the PPP project \ncycle will be covered by the ongoing and planned support of ADB and other development partners. The ongoing TA \n(footnote 1) focuses on PPP programming, preparation, transaction, and implementation phases by strengthening \ngovernment oversight agencies (e.g., the NEDA, PPP Center, and DOF). Dedicated support to selected major \nimplementing agencies in PPP project preparation, transaction, and implementation phases is planned by the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency. Other development partners\u2019 support is largely provided to implementing \nagencies in the context of particular projects. \n12 In addition to the NEDA appraisal focus areas indicated in para. 4, areas such as project structuring, risk allocation, \nand contract management will be covered, as the NEDA Secretariat is mandated under Executive Order 230 to \nprovide technical support to the NEDA Board and ICC. Hence, it is important for the NEDA Secretariat to be well \nrounded on different aspects of project appraisal to be able to adapt easily to any future changes in the PPP review \nprocess. \n ", "4   \n10.  Output  2. The TA will  strengthen DOF\u2019s capacity in managing contingent liabilities \narising from PPP projects by supporting institutionalization and strengthening of capacity at the \nBTr\u2019s DRMO (focusing on the contingent liability unit within DRMO) through on-the-job advisory \nsupport on risk identification, allocation, and monitoring; evaluation of contingent liability for \nevery financing and procurement option; full disclosure of required budget for contingent liability \nand other issues DRMO staff might have on the pipeline and ongoing projects reviewed and \nmonitored by DRMO. Knowledge transfer will be assured as in output 1. \n \n11.  Output  3. The TA  will  strengthen the  institutional framework  of DOF  in fiscal  cost \nmanagement  of  PPP  projects  by  supporting  the  DOF  in  (i)  preparing  contingent  liability \nmanagement plans by the BTr, including through involvement of implementing agencies\u2019 PPP \nunits in contingent liability capacity building for the DOF; (ii) enhancing the contingent liability-\nrelated  link  between  project  processing  (risk  identification  and  allocation,  government \nundertakings approval) and project implementation (monitoring, provisioning, budgeting, funding, \nand disclosure of contingent liabilities); (iii) developing options for fiscal rules related to PPPs \n(e.g., share of contingent liability exposure in total government revenues); (iv) mainstreaming of \ncontingent  liabilities  in  debt  sustainability  analysis;  and  (v)  operationalizing  the  recently \nestablished interagency contingent liability monitoring group. All areas above will contribute to \nimproving the PPP-related elements of the government\u2019s annual fiscal risk statements. \n \n12.  Assumptions and risks. Continuous government commitment to catalyze private sector \ninvestments in infrastructure through the PPP mode and macroeconomic and sociopolitical \nstability  are  important  overall  assumptions  for  the  proposed  TA.  Improved  regulatory  and \ninstitutional  framework  for  PPPs,  timely  and  complete  submission  of  PPP  projects  by \nimplementing agencies for appraisal, and sustained interest of private sector investors and \nlenders  in  PPPs  are  also  important  assumptions.  The  likely  risks  for  the  TA  include  an \nunanticipated  weakening  of  political  will,  ineffective  coordination  among  government \nstakeholders,  delays  in  approval  and  implementation  of  legal  and  regulatory  provisions, \nunexpected disruption in the PDMF or PPP Center\u2019s operations a subsequent lack of bankable \ninfrastructure projects for government review, inadequate or untimely solution of right-of-way \nand land acquisition, and unfavorable judicial decisions. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,200,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office and housing accommodation, \noffice supplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and other in-kind contributions. \nDetails of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The NEDA and DOF will be the executing agencies for the proposed TA. For overall TA \noversight, the government will designate NEDA's Expanded PPP Group (composed of the \nNEDA Build-Operate-Transfer Group, PPP Center, and DOF) as the project steering committee. \nThis committee will decide on matters that cut across all outputs, such as reallocation of funds \namong outputs. Changes related to outputs, inputs, or activities under the NEDA and DOF\u2019s \ncomponents will be approved by the relevant executing agency. To support the project steering \ncommittee, the NEDA will set up a technical working group headed by NEDA\u2019s deputy director \ngeneral for investment programming and DOF will set up a technical working group headed by \nthe  national  treasurer  of  the  Philippines.  NEDA's  technical  working  group  will  supervise \n ", "  5 \nimplementation of output 1, and DOF's technical working group will supervise implementation of \noutputs 2 and 3, including endorsement of consultant deliverables per the agreed business \nprocess. Policies developed under the TA will be elevated for consideration to  the NEDA \nBoard's Infrastructure Committee. The TA is expected to commence in May 2014 and close by \nMay 2016. \n \n15.  The TA will engage two consulting firms: firm 1 to deliver output 1, and firm 2 to deliver \noutputs 2 and 3. The firms will be engaged under indefinite delivery contracts for 1.5 years \n(June 2014\u2013December 2015). The estimated budget for the contract of firm 1 is $1.04 million for \n20 person-months of international and 20 person-months of national consultant inputs.13 The \nestimated budget for the contract of firm 2 is $0.96 million for 19 person-months of international \nand 17 person-months of national consultant inputs. Firm 2 will allocate no more than 40% of its \ntime to capacity building, and 60% should be spent on on-call advisory support to the BTr. The \nfirms will be selected by ADB using quality-based selection on the basis of a full technical \nproposal, and will report directly to the relevant executing agency based on an agreed work \nprogram and business processes. The outline terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix \n3. \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) will \napply  to  consultant  selection.  All  procurement  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  all  funds  used  for \nprocurement will be expended in ADB member countries. Disbursements under the TA will be \ndone  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). TA funds for workshops and seminars will be expended only in \nADB member countries. \n \n17.  Status on TA implementation and PPP support coordination issues will be discussed \nwith development partners using the platform of the PPP working group of ADB, the World Bank \nGroup, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and Australia. The TA\u2019s intermediate and \nfinal results will be disseminated through internal and external knowledge sharing events, as \nwell as by making TA outputs publicly available on the websites of ADB, the NEDA, or the DOF. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n18.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to the Government of the Philippines to \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Strengthening \nEvaluation and Fiscal Cost Management of Public\u2013Private Partnerships. \n \n                                                \n13 If needed, the NEDA and BTr will enter into a confidentiality agreement with their consultant given the sensitivity of \nthe information to be worked with. A detailed operation manual will be developed by the consultant and approved \nby the NEDA and BTr detailing all procedures, timelines, communication aspects, approval authority, and other \nbusiness processes and procedures related to the assignment. The consultant will use materials developed under \nAustralia\u2013Philippines Partnership for Economic Governance Reforms Program and the ongoing TA (footnote 1). \nFor proper management of the inputs under the indefinite delivery contracts, the NEDA and BTr will assign staff to \nbe a single window for advice requests, recording the origin and substance of all requests to the firm, as well as \ntime of request and deliverable submission. The indefinite delivery contracts firm\u2019s timesheets will have to be \nconfirmed by the NEDA and BTr prior to submission to ADB for payment. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nDesign  Performance Targets and Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions and \nSummary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nIncreased and  Starting 2016:  National Statistics  Stable macroeconomic  \nfiscally sustainable  Gross value of private construction (in  Coordination  environment, internal, \ninfrastructure  constant prices) increases by at least 5%  Board\u2019s Philippine  sociopolitical situation \ninvestments  annually (2012 baseline: P393.2 billion)  statistical   \nthrough PPPs    yearbooks  Risks \nPrivate sector\u2019s investment commitment in  Deterioration of the \n \ninfrastructure (except in telecommunications)  government\u2019s fiscal \nincreases on average by at least 5% annually  World Bank Private  situation \n(2012 baseline: $1,405 million)  Participation in   \n  Infrastructure  Weakening of \nBy 2016:  database  government political \nFiscal deficit maintained at targeted 2% of    support for PPP \nGDP   \nPhilippine \nBusiness-unfriendly \nDevelopment Plan \ndecisions of the \nand Updates \ngovernment \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved  By end 2016:  Government  Timely approvals from \ngovernment\u2019s  At least five PPP projects (except in  reports, including  concerned government \nappraisal and  telecommunications), which have benefitted  from the DOF,  agencies and bodies, \nsustainable  from TA support, have been competitively bid  NEDA, and other  and conduct of PPP \nmanagement of  out (2013 baseline: 0)  line departments  project processing \nPPP projects  and agencies   \n  Appropriate incentives \n \nStarting 2016:  for private sector \nGovernment expenditures on contingent  DOF fiscal risk  participation (regulatory \nliabilities arising from PPP projects do not  statements and  risk guarantees and \nexceed amounts authorized in the budget  reports  right-of-way \n(2013 baseline: N/A)    acquisition) \n  Major credit rating   \nSovereign credit rating unaffected by an  agencies  Risks \nincreased portfolio of PPP projects  Delays in development \n(October 2013 S&P rating baseline: BBB-)    of bankable PPP \nprojects \n \nBuild-Operate-Transfer \nLaw amendments \naffecting PPP \ninstitutions \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.
