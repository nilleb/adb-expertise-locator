Since 1991, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been a major partner in \nthe improvement of Mongolia\u2019s transport network and has assisted in developing two major \nhighway corridors linking Mongolia to the Russian Federation and the People\u2019s Republic of China. \nWhile investment in new road construction has grown, it has not been matched by commensurate \nincreases in road maintenance and rehabilitation. The government did not fund any major \nmaintenance or rehabilitation projects in 2012\u20132016, and the amount it allocated to the Ministry \nof Road and Transport Development (MRTD) for routine maintenance was constrained to only \n15% of estimated needs. \n \n2.  The country urgently needs to improve its road asset management (RAM). A previously \nimplemented RAM system is no longer used because of limited funding. Timely road maintenance \nis less costly than allowing roads to deteriorate and need major rehabilitation or reconstruction, \nsaving money in tight fiscal situations. This requires capacity development and institutional \nstrengthening, significant investment in a periodic maintenance and rehabilitation program, and \nstronger  enforcement  of  vehicle  weight  restrictions  to  prevent  costly  road  damage  from \noverloading. \n \n3.  The Government of Mongolia passed the Road Law Amendment, 2017, which ensures \nthat at least 20% of revenues from the vehicle excise tax are allocated to road maintenance. This \nwould add about MNT7 billion to the State Road Fund each year.1 Significantly higher fines and \npenalties, including for truck overloading, will also go into the road fund. Unlike in the past, the \nfund is only for road maintenance and not for new road construction. The amendment is an \nimportant policy change that the project will support. \n \n4.  The  project  will  help  the  government  implement  its  maintenance  program,  and  the \nattached technical assistance (TA) will provide government agencies with extensive training on \nRAM  and  road  safety  improvement.  The  project  will  provide  institutional  strengthening  to \n(i) ensure maintenance financing and prioritization, (ii) increase the efficiency and capacity of road \nmaintenance companies, and (iii) introduce performance-based road maintenance schemes. It \nwill integrate road safety design and new maintenance technologies and will address vehicle \noverloading. \n \n5.  Impact, outcome, and outputs. The project is aligned with the following impact: inclusive \neconomic  growth  promoted  by  enhanced  local,  regional,  and  international  connectivity  in \nMongolia.2 The project outcome will be efficiency of road transport within the project area and \nbetween countries improved. The project outputs are: (i) RAM capacity improved, (ii) road \ncondition improved, and (iii) road safety improved. The project will improve 311 kilometers (km) \nof existing national highway sections comprising Ulaanbaatar\u2013Darkhan (193 km) and Darkhan\u2013\nAltanbulag (118 km). \n \n6.  Cost estimates and financing plan. The project is estimated to cost $60.6 million. The \ngovernment has requested a regular loan of $60.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \n                                                \n1  The State Great Hural (Parliament) of Mongolia. http://www.parliament.mn/n/xroy. The law also provides for an \nincrease in vehicle excise tax rates by 5% to 15%, depending on engine size and vehicle age. \n2  This project-related impact statement aligns with the Mongolian national action plan\u2019s strategy to develop a road, \ntransportation, and logistical network that sustains economic growth, is consistent with social needs and demands, \nand provides safe and comfortable services (Government of Mongolia. 2016. Action Program of the Government of \nMongolia for 2016\u20132020. Ulaanbaatar). \n ", "2 \nto help finance the project. The Government of Mongolia is the borrower of the loan and will \nfinance $0.6 million for project implementation. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n7.  The core development problem in Mongolia\u2019s road transport subsector is unsafe and \ninefficient road transport resulting from an incomplete legal and regulatory framework, lack of \nsustainability caused by inadequate funding and overloading, and inadequate private sector \nparticipation. The government enacted the Mongolian Road Law Amendment, 2017 to develop \nand manage road assets and provide better road service delivery to national and international \nroad users. Under the amended law, the MRTD is expected to manage the national road network \nby  (i)  developing  policies,  strategies,  plans,  and  technical  documents;  (ii)  introducing  new \ntechnologies and approaches in road development and asset management; (iii) protecting roads \nfrom damage; and (iv) developing human resources. Most importantly, this law legalized the State \nRoad Fund to finance road maintenance works and established a road board to monitor revenue \ncollection and expenditure allocation. Preparing the required law implementation procedures is \nnow a priority for the MRTD. \n \n8.  Substantial investment in developing the national road network may diminish in value as \nroads deteriorate because of traffic, flooding, and overloading unless adequate RAM is in place \nand vehicle overloading is better controlled. Through TA, ADB made the first intervention in 2010 \nwhen it introduced a RAM system\u2014an objective maintenance planning and prioritization tool\u2014\nand prepared a 3-year rolling maintenance plan and budget.3 Unfortunately, the planning tool has \nnot  been  mainstreamed,  but  the  MRTD  recognizes  the  importance  of  objectively  planning \nmaintenance works and started collecting the road inventory data through a private consulting \nfirm. On 15 March 2018, the private consulting firm completed and submitted the final report on \nthe inventory data of all international and national roads totaling 15,000 km. The Road Transport \nDevelopment Center (RTDC) collects traffic data on such roads annually. The MRTD urgently \nneeds to collect road condition data and revive the maintenance planning tool to be able to \nmainstream effective RAM practices. \n  \n9.  The implementation of road maintenance also needs improvement to maximize value for \nmoney. Currently, 20 state-owned maintenance companies and eight private companies maintain \nthe national highway network. As the bulk of road maintenance work is being delivered using a \nforce account, quality has become an issue because of the inadequate allocation of funds, \ninsufficient  maintenance  equipment,  and  the  lack  of  internal  quality  control  and  regular \nsupervision by the MRTD and the RTDC. The ADB-financed Second Roads Development Project \npilot tested the outsourcing of routine maintenance works in the early 2000s, which led to some \nacceptance of engaging private operators in road maintenance.4 However, the objective to start \noutsourcing maintenance works was not fully achieved because of regulatory and resource \nconstraints. \n \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Road Database Development Using Geographic Information \nSystem. Manila. \n4  ADB. 1999. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance Grant to Mongolia for the Second Roads Development Project. Manila. The Second Roads Development \nProject pilot tested the outsourcing of routine maintenance works at two locations on paved and unpaved roads \nthrough implementation support for the private contractors by providing light maintenance equipment and technical \nsupport on recording and reporting the completed works. \n ", "3 \n10.  While the MRTD has been trying to address road maintenance, overloaded trucks are \ndamaging Mongolia\u2019s roads, leading to the need for premature repair works. The MRTD has \nestablished five weighbridges across the country, but it needs further assistance in developing a \nstrategic framework to control overloading by reassessing the operation and process used to \ncontrol vehicle overloading; identifying the origins and destinations of heavy goods; and finding \nalternative technologies, solutions, and approaches to control axle loads to reduce road damage \nfrom overloaded trucks. \n \n11.  The TA will assist the MRTD in addressing the incomplete regulatory framework, the lack \nof sustainability of the road asset, and inadequate private sector participation by (i) recommending \nsuitable frameworks for RAM systems that can be implemented; (ii) reviewing and enhancing the \nlaw implementation procedures; and (iii) providing start-up support in adopting an improved RAM \nsystem  and  introducing  a  road  board  to  manage  the  road  assets  effectively.  The  TA  will \nsupplement the planned assistance under the Regional Road Development and Maintenance \nProject, which will provide soft and hard measures on road maintenance, rehabilitation, and \nsafety. Since multidisciplinary knowledge and experience is required to complete TA tasks, the \ngovernment wants ADB to select and supervise consultants directly. Through the exercise, ADB \nwill  continue  to  work  closely  with  the  government  on  policy  dialogue  and  institutional \nenhancement.  \n \n12.  The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020 for Mongolia.5 \nIt is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2017\u20132020 for Mongolia, which includes \nsupport for the improvement and maintenance of regional road corridors.6 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n13.  The  TA  will  (i)  review  the  law  implementation  procedures  for  identifying  gaps  and \nimprovements; (ii) study the national road fund revenue generation methods and the level of road \nfees  or  charges;  and  (iii)  assess  the  organizational  capacity  of  the  MRTD\u2019s  road  sector \ndepartments,  the  RTDC,  the  Mongolian  Road  Association  (MRA),  and  road  maintenance \ncompanies. Based on the results of the review, study, and assessments as well as findings from \ndiscussions and consultations with sector stakeholders, the TA aims to deliver three outputs. \n \n14.  Output 1: Enhanced road asset management introduced. The TA will (i) assess the \napplicability of the existing tools and provide the most suitable RAM system for planning and \nprioritizing maintenance works in Mongolia as well as the requirements for road condition data \ncollection;  (ii)  review  the  drafts  and  provide  recommendations  for  required  procedures, \nregulations, and guidelines for implementing the Law on Road, focusing on the State Road Fund \nand its management; (iii) recommend a results-oriented business process and institutional setup \nfor the organizational structure and standard operating procedure of the MRTD and the RTDC, in \nrelation to RAM, to enable the effective implementation of the amended Law on Roads and its \nassociated law implementation procedures; (iv) evaluate 5\u201310-year road maintenance financing \nneeds using the enhanced RAM system and recommend an efficient mechanism to ensure \nsufficient revenues and budget allocation; and (v) provide start-up support in preparing a 3-year \nroad maintenance rolling program. \n \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2018.

Output 2: Strategy prepared to enhance efficiency of maintenance implementation \narrangements. The TA will (i) develop a strategy for engaging the private sector more effectively \nin road maintenance, including systematic outsourcing of road maintenance works; (ii) prepare a \nroad map for implementing the strategy, with clear indicators and targets to monitor the change \nand performance of road maintenance operators; (iii) recommend ways to strengthen the road \nmaintenance companies\u2019 human and technical capacity and business processes for preparing \nfuture divesting the road maintenance companies; and (iv) strengthen technical documents such \nas  standard  bidding  documents  for  various  road  maintenance  works  and  the  manual  for \nmaintenance supervision. \n \n16.  Output 3: Axle load control operations improved. The TA will (i) develop a strategy to \ncombat vehicle overloading that will direct the MRTD to introduce stepwise approaches that can \nbe implemented and cost-effective technologies to reduce vehicle overloading; (ii) prepare a road \nmap for implementing the strategy, with clear indicators and targets to monitor the change and \nperformance; (iii) recommend ways to strengthen the MRTD and the RTDC business processes \nfor implementing the strategy and road map effectively; (iv) recommend strategic locations to \ncontrol axle loads; and (v) prepare technical guidance documents to control overloaded vehicles \nand to calibrate and commission the weigh scales and other equipment necessary for measuring \naxle loads. \n \n17.  Activities. To deliver these outputs, the MRTD will assign one key focal person to work \nclosely  with  consultants.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  assign  another  focal  person \nrepresenting the General Department of Budget to assist the TA consultants in delivering output 1 \nin regard to operationalizing the road fund. \n  \n18.  Since the TA will address broader road sector development and financing issues, it will \nfollow a participatory approach. The consultants will engage stakeholders in preparing the \ninstitutional, regulatory, and strategic frameworks by (i) organizing brainstorming sessions and \nconsultations with target groups to reach a consensus on the newly drafted law implementation \nprocedures, road maintenance financing and management, strengthened business process, and \norganizational changes; and (ii) conducting a workshop and seminars for targeted groups to \nobtain feedback on the technical documents. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $730,000, of which $700,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 1. \n \n20.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation, \nsupport facilities, counterpart staff, access to information and reports, logistical support, and other \nin-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  ADB will administer the TA. The Transport and Communications Division of ADB\u2019s East \nAsia Department will be responsible for TA administration and the engagement of consultants. \nThe MRTD will be the executing agency of the TA and will coordinate closely with the MOF, the \nRTDC, and the MRA on TA implementation. The TA is expected to be implemented from June \n2019 to January 2021. \n \n ", "5 \n22.
