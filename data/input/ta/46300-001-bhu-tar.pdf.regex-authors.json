INTRODUCTION \n1.  During an Asian Development Bank (ADB) country programming mission in June 2012, \nthe Government of Bhutan requested ADB to provide technical assistance (TA) grants (i) to \nenhance the enabling environment for a deeper and more stable capital market, (ii) to support the \nrestructuring and improvement of the information and communication technology (ICT) capacity \nof the National Pension and Provident Fund (NPPF), and (iii) to support the implementation of the \nStrengthening Economic Management Program (SEMP), which will be considered for approval by \nthe ADB Board of Directors in early 2013. The request reflected the government\u2019s efforts under its \nTenth Five Year Plan, 2008\u20132013 to strengthen financial resource mobilization in the country and \nto promote economic and financial governance.1 This TA, which arose from the government \nrequest,2 was included in ADB\u2019s 2012\u20132013 interim country partnership strategy and ADB\u2019s \n2013\u20132015 country operations business plan for Bhutan.3 The TA combines the three TA projects \nthat were originally planned\u2014the capital market development TA, the NPPF TA, and the TA to \nsupport implementation of key reform actions under SEMP. This is part of an exercise by ADB\u2019s \nSouth Asia Department to consolidate TA projects to achieve efficiencies in processing one \nproject.  \n \n2.  The mission visited Bhutan 14\u201315 August 2012 and met with senior officials from the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF), the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA), the Royal Securities Exchange \nof Bhutan (RSEB), and the NPPF. The government and the mission reached an understanding on \nthe objectives, scope, financing plan, and implementation details of the TA. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \nA.  Capital Market Architecture \n \n3.  The RSEB was incorporated in 1993 under the Companies Act, 1982 and the Financial \nInstitutions Act, 1992. Its initial Nu2 million authorized capital was provided by the Bank of Bhutan, \nthe  Bhutan  National  Bank,  the  Bhutan  Development  Finance  Corporation,  and  the  Royal \nInsurance  Corporation  of  Bhutan\u2014the  four  institutions  with  brokerage  firms  that  were  then \nlicensed  to  serve  as dealer  brokers.  The  RSEB  is  now  owned  by  these  four  dealer-broker \nmembers. Initial public offerings (IPOs) of shares must be carried out through the RSEB. At the \nend of 2011, 22 companies were listed on the RSEB. The exchange had little secondary trading. \nThe RSEB also hosts primary offerings of large amounts of government and RMA debt, and it \nhad four corporate bonds outstanding at the end of 2011. There is no secondary market in debt. \n \n4.  The RSEB is subject to supervision by the RMA, which is the acting securities commission \nand also approves and amends RSEB rules. The RSEB is currently regulated by provisions of the \nCompanies  Act  (2000),  the  Securities  Exchange  Regulation  (1993),  the  Control  of  Brokers \nRegulations (1993), and rules on listing and other matters adopted in 1993.  \n \n5.  The RSEB\u2019s  annual report 2011 indicates that market capitalization of listed companies \nhas grown to Nu14.38 billion at the  end of December 2011, or 15.0% of gross domestic product \n(GDP), compared to Nu10.01 billion at the end of December 2010, or 10% of GDP. The total \nvalue  of  shares  traded  on  the  secondary  market  in  2011  was  Nu132.9  million,  down  from \n                                                 \n1 Government of Bhutan, Gross National Happiness Commission. 2009. Tenth Five Year Plan, 2008\u20132013. \nThimphu. \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 November 2012. \n3 ADB. 2012. Interim Country Partnership Strategy: Bhutan, 2012\u20132013. Manila; and ADB. 2012. Country \nOperations Business Plan: Bhutan, 2013\u20132015. Manila. \n ", "2  \nNu145.8 million in the previous year. The total trading volume on the secondary (post-distribution) \nmarket was 375,758 shares in 2011, down from 819,163 in 2010. One IPO was conducted in \n2011 for T-Bank.  \n \n6.  In April 2012, the RSEB changed from a back office trading system to a web-based \nintegrated exchange system that links seamlessly with an electronic depository, clearing and \nsettlement, market surveillance, IPO, and broker back office system. Investors now have access \nto real-time market data and can trade online. Market players, such as depository participants, \nclearing members, and custodians, now form an integral part of the new system. The RSEB\u2019s \ncentral depository division uses the new electronic depository system to ensure instantaneous \ntransfer of ownership, instant credit of corporate entitlements (bonus, rights, and new issues), and \nsecure custody of securities. The number of shareholders rose from 40,774 at the end of 2010 to \n48,005 at the end of 2011, an increase mainly attributed to new investors attracted by the T-Bank \nIPO. \n \n7.  The MOF and the RMA began issuing 91-day treasury bills in 2009 to help fill the financial \nresource gap within the country and develop the domestic debt market. The treasury bills, totaling \nNu2  billion,  were  issued  on  14  December  2009  and  sold  at  a  discount  rate  of  2.5%.  The \nintroduction of treasury bills played an integral part in liberalizing interest rates and building the \ncapital and debt market by developing a yield curve. The sale or auction of government securities \nnot only helped the government borrow funds at the market price, it also created additional \ninvestment opportunities for domestic investors and fund managers. The RMA suggested that the \ngovernment issue debt securities on a regular basis to strengthen the budget process and \nliquidity management and provide a credible domestic debt market for the benefit of both issuing \nagents and market participants. The RMA conducted three Nu500 million treasury bill issues \nduring 2011. The institutionalization and operationalization of debt markets, particularly in short-\nterm secondary debt securities, remain essential parts of fiscal and monetary policy management \nin Bhutan. \n \nB.  Key Development Issues \n \n8.  The  government  established  the  NPPF  in  March  2000  as  an  autonomous  agency \nresponsible for administering the pension and provident fund plan for the civil service, corporate \nemployees, and the armed forces. With assets of more than Nu12 billion in 2011, the NPPF is the \nlargest  institutional  investor  in  Bhutan  and  has  fiduciary  responsibility  for  managing  its \ninvestments. Because the capital market was underdeveloped and the availability of investment \ninstruments  was  limited,  the  RMA  mandated  the  NPPF  at  the  fund\u2019s  inception  in  2001  to \nundertake limited lending activities. Following adoption of the Financial Services Act in June 2011, \nhowever, the RMA directed the NPPF to end lending activities from June 2014. This necessitates \na major reorientation of NPPF\u2019s business plan and an assessment of options for a restructuring. \nThis assessment must include a cost\u2013benefit analysis of alternative strategies for managing \nNPPF\u2019s investments and the formulation of an alternative investment policy. As noted in the \ngovernment\u2019s request for TA, the NPPF also lacks ICT capacity and faces data security risks from \npotential database corruption, hardware failures, and natural disasters due to its lack of a data \ncenter and disaster recovery system.  \n \n9.  Lack of a regulatory and financial supervisory policy for the fund management industry \nimpedes the establishment of fund management and investment companies (FMICs) in Bhutan, \nwhich in turn has limited participation by institutional investors in the country\u2019s capital market. \nFMICs provide investment opportunities for these institutions and for retail investors through \nmutual funds, hedge funds, equity funds, real estate funds, and infrastructure funds. By opening \nup these new avenues for investment, these companies foster economic growth.  \n ", "  3\n \n10.  The government has no long-term development strategy or road map for the country\u2019s \ncapital market, which leaves stakeholders unclear about the market\u2019s long-term direction and \nmeans that no master plan exists for positioning the capital market to support economic growth \nand improvement of the lives of the country\u2019s people.  \n \n11.  Capital market development is also inhibited by the lack of a domestic credit rating agency \n(DCRA). The establishment of a reliable DCRA would enhance demand for equities and bonds \nfrom institutional investors in the capital market but one cannot be created until the government \nadopts a policy and clear rules on financial regulation and supervision. Contractual savings \ninstitutions such as insurance companies and pension and provident funds can only normally \ninvest in long-tenure instruments that have been rated sound and of investment-grade quality by \ndependable rating agencies. A Bhutan DCRA would facilitate IPOs because a reliable credit \nrating is the basis on which an issuer offers and promotes its debt in the market. Credit ratings \nalso help regulators conduct oversight by providing a third party opinion on companies and \ninvestment instruments that can be widely shared with the investing public. Introducing a DCRA \nin Bhutan will also encourage foreign investment in its capital market because the domestic credit \nratings of a Bhutan debt instrument could be benchmarked against investment options in other \ncountries. \n \n12.  Weak debt management by the government has led to a deteriorating cash position. This \nhas in turn created a currency mismatch problem. In 2011, the MOF and the RMA had to address \na liquidity crunch in Indian rupees and a reduction in Indian rupee reserves as part of efforts to \nimprove macro financial stability. The demand for rupees spiked in the early part of 2012 when \nlarge loan payments became due. The external imbalance became serious enough in December \n2011 that the RMA and the government had to sell Indian rupees held in the form of gross \ninternal reserves, as well as $200 million from gross international reserves, to pay bills from India. \nThe insufficient debt management capability also impedes the development of an efficient market \nfor government securities, which is critical to creating a liquid domestic debt market. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact will be a well-functioning financial system that supports basic capital and \ninvestment needs, as well as Bhutan\u2019s longer-term economic objectives. The outcome will be a \ndeeper and more stable capital market. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will have six outputs: \n \n(i)  Restructuring and enhanced ICT capacity of NPPF. The TA will help the NPPF \nassess  the  options  for  reorienting  its  business  plan,  which  has  been  made \nnecessary by the mandated discontinuation of its retail lending from June 2014 \n(para. 8). This will entail the development of modalities for alternative investments \nby the NPPF, in line with international best practices that fit the environment in \nBhutan. The TA will also enhance the ICT capacity of NPPF through procurement \nof a data center and disaster recovery system that will ensure user data security \nand mitigate risks such as database corruption, hardware failures, and damage \nfrom natural disasters. \n ", "4  \n(ii)  Establishment  of  regulatory  and  supervisory  framework  for  fund \nmanagement industry. The TA will help establish a regulatory and supervisory \nframework  for  a  fund  management  industry.  It  will  help  the  RMA  develop  a \nregulatory and financial supervisory policy, along with effective regulations and \nrules for a fund management industry and the supervision of fund management \ncompanies. This will ensure the stability of the financial system. Training will also \nbe provided to build RMA staff expertise at the management and the department \nlevels for drafting and implementing fund management industry regulations.  \n(iii)  Formulation of a capital market master plan. The TA will help the RMA, the \nMOF, the RSEB, brokerage firms, fund management companies, and other capital \nmarket intermediaries formulate a master plan that charts the direction of the \ncapital  market  during  2013\u20132022.  This  master  plan  will  aim  to  provide \nstakeholders with a vision and clear objectives for the capital market and will \ninclude recommendations to be implemented over the medium and long terms. \nThe master plan will also provide a foundation for establishing a corporate bond \nmarket and the fund management industry. It will aim to ensure that the capital \nmarket supports Bhutan\u2019s socioeconomic development and inclusive growth for \nboth its urban and rural populations. \n(iv)  Establishment of regulatory and supervisory framework for domestic credit \nrating agency. The TA will help the RMA establish a regulatory and supervisory \nframework for establishing a DCRA in Bhutan, which will include an operating \nlicense regime. The TA will help enhance the capacity of the regulators of the \ncredit rating agency both at the management and the supervisory levels to provide \nthe understanding needed for introducing the appropriate level of regulation and \nsupervision  for  rating  agencies.  The  establishment  of  a  DCRA  would  add  an \nimportant dimension to the capital market by catalyzing growth in the supply and \ndemand  of  equities  and  bonds,  as  well  as  by  promoting  the  entry  of  foreign \ninvestment. \n(v)  Strengthened  public  debt  management.  The TA  will strengthen public debt \nmanagement practices within the MOF by building on work initiated by the World \nBank in November 2011 to formulate a public debt management reform plan. The \nplan will focus on implementing a medium-term debt management strategy. The \nstrategy will involve debt monitoring (including forecasting debt repayments) and \ntimely  short-term  bond  issuances  according  to  maturity  profiles  and  currency \ndenominations to even out debt payments over the medium term in a way that \navoids  spikes  and  asset\u2013liability  mismatches.  The  strategy  will  encompass \nmeasures to develop and maintain an efficient market for government securities, \nwhich is a crucial prerequisite to the creation of a liquid domestic debt market. \nSupport will also be provided to help the MOF successfully issue bonds in India \nthat will be denominated in that country\u2019s currency and thus alleviate the lndian \nrupee liquidity crunch facing Bhutan. \n(vi)  Supporting capacity for the Strengthening Economic Management Program. \nThe TA will support capacity building for key reform actions under ADB\u2019s proposed \nSEMP, as well as its implementation if it is approved by the Board, as scheduled, \nin early 2013. In doing so, the TA will contribute to a stable and sustainable high \ngrowth rate for Bhutan over the medium and long term through a program that will \naim to curtail excessive domestic credit growth, limit rapid expansion of public \nspending, and enhance the scope for liquidity management. The TA will also help \nthe government explore the possible subscription of an international sovereign \ncredit rating. \n \n ", "  5\n15.  ADB assumes that the government will continue to give high priority to capital market \ndevelopment.  A  major  risk  is  that  the  RSEB  laws  and  regulations  will  not  be  adopted, \nimplemented properly, or enforced.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,390,000, of which $1,250,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will provide \ncounterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  office  supplies, \nsecretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The MOF will be the executing agency for the TA. The RMA will be the implementing \nagency and will set up the project management unit (PMU) headed by the project director, who \nwill be an RMA executive. The project director will be responsible for the overall administration of \nthe  TA,  disbursement,  accounts  maintenance,  and  reporting  to  ADB.  The  alternate  project \ndirector for the PMU will be an MOF executive. The PMU will meet every month or as often as \nneeded and will provide all reports and minutes of PMU meetings to ADB for reference. The \nproject manager and alternate project manager for each of the six TA outputs will be responsible \nfor achieving their TA outputs and will report to the PMU. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months, from January 2013 to December 2015.  \nSeven international consultants will provide a total of 26.5 person-months of consulting services \n(Appendix  3).  The  selection  of  a  consultant  firm  for  five  consultants  will  be  based  on  the \nsubmission of a simplified technical proposal and based on the standard quality- and cost-based \nselection process (quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20). Two consultants\u2014a bond expert and a banking \nsector  expert\u2014will  be  engaged  individually.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAll  procurement  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). Disbursement under the TA project will be done in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n19.  Each consultant will submit an inception report to the PMU and ADB within 1 week of the \nstart of work and a draft final report 1 week before the end of the engagement. The inception \nreport and finalization of the draft final reports will be discussed at tripartite meetings involving the \nPMU, the consultants, and ADB. The PMU will provide a brief report to ADB on the progress \nmade in supervision activities on a yearly basis for the 2 years after 2015. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,250,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bhutan for Capital Market Development, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Targets     \n  and Indicators with  Data Sources and   \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nA well-functioning  Private investment    Political stability and \nfinancial system that  increases to 65% as a  RSEB annual reports  commitment to financial sector \nsupports basic capital  percentage of GDP by end  RMA annual reports  reforms are sustained. \nand investment needs,  of December 2018   \nas well as Bhutan\u2019s  (baseline: 47.5% in 2011)  Risk \nlonger-term economic  Economy is affected by \nobjectives significant negative external \n \nshocks.\n \nOutcome      Assumption \nA deeper and more  Enlistment of new  RSEB annual reports  The government will continue \nstable capital market  securities increases to 28  RMA annual reports  to give high priority to capital \nby end of December 2015  market development. \n(baseline: 22 in 2011) \n \nNumber of corporate \nbonds outstanding \nincreases to 10 by end of \n2015 (baseline: 4 in 2011)\n \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
