INTRODUCTION \n1.  Project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) for the Power Distribution Enhancement \nMultitranche Financing Facility is included in the 2006\u20132008 country strategy and program \nupdate1 (CSPU) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). An ensuing loan project is included in \nthe lending program for 2007. The ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Pakistan from 9 to 17 \nMarch 2006, and reached an understanding with the Government concerning the objective, \nscope, costs, financing, implementation arrangements, and the consultants\u2019 outline terms of \nreference for the PPTA.2  The PPTA design and monitoring framework is provided in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  Pakistan\u2019s eight distribution companies3 were established through a restructuring and \nunbundling  of  the  power  wing  of  the  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority  (WAPDA).  \nDistribution  companies  are  responsible  for  channeling  electricity  from  the  transmission \nsubstations at 132 kilovolts (kV) to the consumers. The end users are classified as bulk, \nindustrial, commercial, or household consumers. The distribution network is composed of lines \nand grid stations of 132kV and lower voltage capacities, and each distribution company is \nresponsible for constructing, operating, and maintaining the power distribution facilities within \neach dedicated geographic area. As of mid-2005, the distribution system of Pakistan consisted \nof 28,196 kilometers (km) of 132kV lines, 7,552 km of 66kV lines, 212,929 km of 11kV lines, \n149,985 km of 0.4kV lines, 457 132kV substations, and 195 66kV substations. Overall, the \ndistribution system is overstressed, and needs to be upgraded, augmented, and expanded. In \naddition,  the  financial  health  and  sustainability  of  the  distribution  companies  need  to  be \nassessed, as technical and non-technical losses are depleting the companies.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Pakistan\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development  Framework  2005\u201320104  (MTDF)  sets  out  a \nchallenging infrastructure investment program, in order to achieve a consistent 8% annual \ngrowth in gross domestic product (GDP). The overarching goal of the Government is poverty \nreduction through economic development. An increase in the supply of infrastructure services \ncreates  economic  opportunities  in  both  urban  and  rural  areas.  As  the  power  sector  is  a \nfundamental  component  of  the  infrastructure  sector,  the  distribution  system  needs  to  be \nstrengthened  and  expanded  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  economic  growth  target  and  its \npoverty reduction efforts. \n4.  Electricity demand in Pakistan is forecasted to grow by 8.3% a year during 2005\u20132015. \nTo cope with this growth in demand, it is estimated that Pakistan will require an additional 2,000 \nmegawatts (MWs) annually, which will need to be evacuated through the transmission and \ndistribution  systems.  Substantial  investments  will  be  needed  to  strengthen  the  distribution \nsystem to (i) handle the power generated by additional power plants, and (ii) rehabilitate and \naugment the current system to maintain the current electricity supply to meet the growing \ndemand. The eight distribution companies have individual development programs for 2005\u2013\n2012.  The  Government  has  approved  several  schemes  included  in  these  programs. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006-2008): Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Manila. \n2   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 12 April 2006. \n3  The eight distribution companies are as follows: Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO), Gujranwala \nElectricity Supply Company (GESCO), Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (HESCO), Islamabad Electric Supply \nCompany (IESCO), Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO), Multan Electric Supply Company (MESCO), \nPeshawar Electric Supply Company (PESCO), and Quetta Electric Supply Company (QESCO). \n4   Planning Commission of the Government of Pakistan. 2005. Medium-Term Development Framework (2005\u20132010). \nIslamabad. \n ", "2   \nInvestments are required to ensure that the high number of customers needing electricity are \nconnected without delay. Pending applications for electricity connection was 163,071 as of June \n2005, implying substantial investment would be required including consumer meters.   \n5.   The official transmission and distribution losses in Pakistan were 22.7% in fiscal year \n(FY) 2004; distribution losses accounted for 15.3%. Substantial losses in the distribution system \nare  caused  by  (i)  shortage  of  distribution  lines  and  transformers,  (ii)  insufficiently  long \ndistribution lines, (iii) inadequate voltage profile of distribution system, and (iv) a large number of \nunmetered customers. Distribution losses need to be reduced to attain efficient power supply. \nTo ensure (i) reliable and high-quality electricity supply to all customers, and (ii) an efficient \ndistribution system, the scope of work of the ensuing loan needs to include investments in \nsubprojects for enhancement, rehabilitation, and expansion of the distribution systems of all \ndistribution companies. \n6.  From  experience,  delays  in  preparing  environmental  and  social  assessment  (ESA) \nreports  are  particularly  pronounced.  The  following  issues  need  to  be  addressed:  (i) \nstrengthening distribution companies\u2019 capacity and ability to address ESA issues, and (ii) the \nneed for implementation consultants that would assist the distribution companies in completing \nESAs on time. The distribution companies have been informed that no subproject can be \nevaluated or approved unless there is a satisfactory environmental impact assessment and \nsummary environmental impact assessment inclusive of resettlement plans as appropriate.  \n7.  Financial  restructuring  and  sustainability  of  the  distribution  companies  are  major \nconcerns. The World Bank, which has traditionally been the lead agency in this regard, is driving \nthe  interaction  with  the  distribution  companies,  the  Pakistan  Electric  Power  Company \n(PEPCO),5 WAPDA, and the Government to ensure progress in these areas. The balance \nsheets of WAPDA and the successor companies, inclusive of the distribution companies, were \nrestructured by reflecting the past conversions of debt into equity in their balance sheets. As a \nresult of this, and additional debt-to-equity swaps for some distribution companies, all of the \ndistribution companies now have positive net worth and equity-to-debt ratio of at least 20:80. \nThis important action should make it easier for distribution companies to approach commercial \nlenders, develop more sustainable financial recovery plans, and undertake investment projects. \nHowever, it will also depend on the new tariffs,6 as well as on the ability of the companies to \naccurately meter, bill, and collect from each customer. The National Electric Power Regulatory \nAuthority (NEPRA) and the Ministry of Water and Power (MOWP) are in the process of finalizing \nthe tariff for each distribution company. During the implementation of the PPTA, the tariffs will \nbe reviewed and assessed together with other financial and economic parameters.  \n8.  The determination and notification of a specific tariff for each distribution company is still \npending. A full financial assessment of the distribution companies cannot be conducted at this \ntime, but the tariffs should be in place by the time the PPTA is being implemented. Accordingly, \na financial assessment of the distribution companies will be done under the PPTA. A preliminary \nassessment  undertaken  by  the  World  Bank  showed  that  based  on  the  existing  tariffs, \nHyderabad Electric Supply Company (HESCO), Multan Electric Supply Company (MESCO), \nPeshawar Electric Supply Company (PESCO), and Quetta Electric Supply Company (QESCO) \nwould be unable to meet operational expenditure and debt service requirements. They would \nnot have any internal resources to finance investments and, accordingly, would not be viable \n                                                 \n5  The Pakistan Electric Power Company (PEPCO) was established in 1998 to oversee and drive the restructuring \nand unbundling of the power sector and in particular the unbundling of WAPDA. The Chairman of PEPCO holds all \nthe shares on behalf of the President of Pakistan, in the unbundled entities.  \n6   With the existing tariffs, several distribution companies are not financially viable. \n ", "  3\nborrowers. It is expected that these financial issues will be addressed in the tariff determination \nprocess. \n9.  Public  sector  intervention  is  the  optimal  financing  modality  at  this  time.  Distribution \ncompanies are not yet at the point where at least the more advanced distribution companies can \nbe privatized. One distribution company, Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO), is part \nof  the  Government\u2019s  privatization  program,  and  the  privatization  advisor  has  brought  the \ntransaction to a relatively advance state. However, without a specific tariff determination and \nnotification for FESCO, attracting private energy sector companies to bid for FESCO will be \ndifficult.  To  ensure  the  timely  development  of  the  distribution  subsector  countrywide,  and \naccommodate the individual development of each distribution company, a multitranche financing \nfacility modality will provide the required flexibility for the individual distribution companies and \nthe subsector as a whole. At the same time, it will also ensure incentives through access to \ncapital when required, after meeting predetermined milestones for successive tranches.  \n10.  The PPTA would need to discuss rural electrification with MOWP to ensure a predictable \nfuture  for  the  distribution  companies  in  terms  of  rural-electrification  developments.  Rural \nelectrification is generally not financially viable for distribution companies because it requires \nconstruction of relatively long distribution lines from the grid system to low-density areas. An \neffective rural-electrification policy that includes subsidies would be required. \n11.  Although Pakistan has a well-established power sector regulator that has received ADB \ncapacity-building support in the past, the relationship between NEPRA and the distribution \ncompanies should be evaluated to address deficiencies. This issue would be addressed during \nthe implementation of the PPTA.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The purpose of the PPTA is to support the Government\u2019s strategy for continued poverty \nreduction through sustained economic growth. The PPTA will assist in the preparation of a \npower distribution enhancement project to ensure a sufficient and stable power supply through \nthe distribution system in Pakistan to the end consumers. The project will improve system \nstability  and  security,  reduce  losses,  and  improve  the  reliability  of  supply  through  (i)  the \nconstruction  and  upgrading  of  132  kV,  66  kV,  32  kV,  and  11  kV  distribution  lines;  (ii) \nconstruction of 132 kV substations and 66 kV substations; (iii) extension of 132 kV and 66 kV \nsubstations; (iv) and upgrading and installation of the metering system and meters.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Key activities to be undertaken under the PPTA cover four major areas: (i) technical \nproject design; (ii) economic and financial evaluations; (iii) compliance with the national and \nADB\u2019s safeguard policies; and (iv) links between economic growth, poverty, and the power \nsector. The four major areas will include the following scope. \n  \n14.  For finalization of the technical project design, a detailed review of load forecasts will be \nundertaken  to  ensure  least-cost  technical  design  and  economic  viability  of  the  proposed \nsubprojects. Feasibility studies will be reviewed, and procurement plans will be prepared. \n \n ", "4   \n15.  In addition to a financial analysis of the project, the financial management capabilities \nand the financial performance of the implementing agencies will be assessed. These financial \nmanagement issues are important as the distribution companies have relatively recently been \nunbundled from WAPDA, and accordingly, separate financial management systems need to be \ndeveloped for the distribution companies. Interaction with NEPRA would ensure full knowledge \nconcerning the tariff application and determination matters related to the distribution operations \nof each distribution company and the power sector overall. In addition to an economic analysis \nof the project, economic subsidies involved in the current tariff structure and the extent of cross-\nsubsidization between major consumer groups and regions will be analyzed. Existing estimates \nfor costs of unserved energy due to unreliability of the system will be updated, and several \nscenarios for the load growth forecast of each distribution company will be developed.  \n \n16.  To ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard polices for the environment and involuntary \nresettlement, field surveys will be undertaken along the planned alignment of the distribution \nlines, the sites of the new grid stations, and the access roads to identify any environmental \nimpacts and to prepare an inventory of all land and project-affected households. Mitigation \nmeasures will be identified, implementation arrangements will be proposed, and cost estimates \nwill be calculated. An initial environmental examination and a summary initial environmental \nexamination will be prepared. A full resettlement plan will also be prepared since the temporary \nand  permanent  loss  of  productive  means  for  affected  persons  could  be  significant.  The \nresettlement plan will include design of public information, disclosure and grievance procedures, \nand costing of compensation. The project\u2019s impacts are not expected to cause any specific \ncultural or social impact on any socioeconomic group, including indigenous people, or exclude \nany from benefiting from the proposed subprojects. Therefore, no specific indigenous peoples \nplan is required. The summary initial social and poverty analysis is provided as Appendix 2. \n \n17.  To  analyze  the  way  in  which  the  proposed  distribution  project  is  linked  to  poverty \nreduction, a detailed poverty analysis will be undertaken, making use of existing surveys and \nprovincial data combined with field consultations. The assessment will be carried out at three \nlevels: (i) direct, (ii) indirect, and (iii) macroeconomic effects. Particular attention will be paid to \nsector shifts in production activities and unskilled labor intensity of employment opportunities. \nIndicators for benefit monitoring will also be prepared.  \n \n18.  The rationale for the proposed 132/66/33/11 kV distribution lines and the new 132kV and \n66 kV substations is closely related to specific generation expansion projects. Thus, any delay \nin the construction of those plants, or a change in the location of the plants, would make the \nproposed investments in the distribution lines and substation unjustifiable. This is a potential risk \nfor project economic and financial viability.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $1,100,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $900,000 equivalent. The PPTA will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the \nremaining  $200,000  equivalent  of  local  currency  costs  through  in-kind  contributions  of  the \nexecuting and implementing agencies. These will include office accommodation and facilities, \nlocal  communication,  counterpart  staff,  data,  and  other  information  needed  for  the  PPTA. \nDetailed cost estimates are provided in Appendix 3. The Government has been advised that \nADB\u2019s approval of the PPTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  PEPCO,  as  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  PPTA,  has  nominated  each  distribution \ncompany to be an implementing agency (IA). The distribution companies acquired varied levels \nof experience with implementing externally funded projects when they were bundled under \nWAPDA.  PEPCO  will  assist  the  PPTA  consultants  in  liaising  with  government  ministries, \nagencies, provincial authorities, in obtaining data and documentation. PEPCO and IAs will liaise \nwith  MOWP  and  provinces  affected  by  the  proposed  power  distribution  project  to  ensure \ncoordination and understanding of the proposed project. It is also envisioned that the distribution \ncompanies will utilize additional assistance from the TA Loan for Infrastructure Development.7 \nAn amount of $2.6 million has been allocated to the distribution companies under this facility. \n \n21.  The PPTA will require about 14 person-months of international and 62 person-months of \nnational consulting services. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are provided in \nAppendix 4. The PPTA will be carried out over a 6-month period beginning in February 2007. At \nthe initial stage of TA implementation, a workshop for provincial and district compensation \ncouncils will be held to determine the work to be undertaken by the consultants and ADB\u2019s \nrequirements related to resettlement. Tripartite workshops (including the IAs) will be held after \nthe submission of the inception, interim, and draft final reports. The consultants will prepare \nstatus reports for their specific scopes of work, highlighting any issues that could become critical \nfor the timely completion of the PPTA. The consultants will arrange for other workshops and on-\nthe-job training for IAs/MOWP staff and for provincial and local governments, as necessary. \nThree  domestic  consultant  teams  will  each  be  assigned  to  work  with  three  distribution \ncompanies,  under  the  guidance  of  the  international  consulting  team.  The  international \nconsultants will have expertise in project and energy economics, financial analysis and financial \nmanagement, power systems, and especially in distribution system planning, environmental \nimpact assessment, resettlement, and other social issues. A consulting firm or consortium of \nfirms will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April \n2006). Recruitment of consultants will be under the quality and cost-based selection procedures, \nand simplified technical proposals will be requested. Equipment to be financed under the TA will \nbe procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Pakistan for preparing the Power Distribution Enhancement Multitranche \nFinancing Facility, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n7  TA Loan No. 2178-PAK (ADB. 2005.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \n \nThe Government is committed to reducing poverty in the country, through economic development. One way \nto tackle poverty by enhancing economic growth is through infrastructure development. The power sector, in \nparticular, will need a considerable amount of investments to meet the growth requirements. Electrification constitutes \na national goal because of its influence on achieving other development goals. \n \nAlthough electrification and electricity consumption are not meant be considered as outcomes, they are \nconsidered to be fundamental inputs for poverty reduction and economic growth. Consumption patterns are skewed in \nterms of nonpoor and poor consumers, as electricity consumption by the poor tends to be determined by affordability \nof  appliances.  Despite  these  patterns,  the  high  connection  ratios  across  most  provinces  suggest  that  capital \ninvestments in the power sector are inclusive of the poor in two ways: (i) directly as consumers, and (ii) indirectly \nthrough the creation of off-farm employment opportunities in the private sector and economic growth.  \n \nThe poor are disproportionately burdened by the unreliable supply of quality power. Compared to nonpoor \nhouseholds, they are (i) less able to resort to alternative sources of power, and (ii) less diversified in income sources. \nThe loss of an income source has a greater impact on a poor household. On the other hand, access to a reliable \npower supply can attract commercial and micro industrial activities, which in turn may enable the poor to diversify \nincome sources through the increased availability of employment opportunities. Access to on-grid power supply is also \nexpected to improve households\u2019 living standards and give them new opportunities to generate income. Positive \nimpacts are also expected in health, especially for women, following the shift from fuel to on-grid sources of electricity. \nFinally, a more reliable and secure supply of energy can drastically improve the quality of sanitation, health care and \nother social services, particularly education. \n \nThe ability of provincial governments to fulfill economic development plans to support social development and \noff-farm job creation depends on the availability of sufficient power to support expansion of commercial and industrial \nactivities. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nPakistan has a complex social structure. To better understand the project\u2019s impact on poverty and its diverse social \ndimensions, the PPTA will need to use national consultants to prepare a social impact assessment and a poverty \nimpact assessment. A Gender Action Plan (GAP) will also be prepared to assess the project\u2019s anticipated impacts on \nwomen and to ensure the design of mitigation measure if negative impacts occur. \n \nA socioeconomic survey will be carried out as a basis for such assessments. Analysis on resettlement and Indigenous \nPeople will be necessary to the social assessment, although, at present, the project is not expected to affect them. A \npoverty impact assessment will be undertaken separately. From the results of these analyses, the consultants will \nprepare a resettlement plan, which is expected to be comprehensive, and incorporate mitigation measures and their \ncosts into the project\u2019s cost estimates. The poverty impact assessment will include a poverty profile, an assessment of \nthe direct and indirect impacts on the poor, and detailed information on the beneficiaries, particularly the poorest and \nthe most vulnerable groups.  \n \nFinally, the consultants will analyze willingness to pay, tariffs, and affordability to improve understanding of the general \nimpacts (positive and negative) on the poor and other vulnerable groups. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \nC.
