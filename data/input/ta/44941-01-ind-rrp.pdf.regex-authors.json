I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nguarantee  facility  for  solar  power  generation  projects  in  India.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Identification and Selection \n2.  Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) supports the Ministry of New \nand Renewable Energy (MNRE) in the formulation and implementation of India\u2019s National Solar \nMission (NSM), announced by the Government of India in January 2010. 1 The NSM intends to \ncommission 20,000 megawatts (MW) in grid-connected solar power generation by 2022 to help \nfill persistent energy shortages with diversified low-carbon power generation, secure its energy \nindependence using indigenous resources, and become a manufacturing hub for the solar \nenergy industry in Asia.  \n \n3.  During TA implementation, ADB staff engaged the MNRE in various discussions on how \nto  encourage  private  sector  investment  in  and  financing  of  solar  projects  under  the  NSM \nprogram. This included specific assistance on drafting a bankable power purchase agreement \n(and a subsequent power sales agreement with the states), transparent eligibility guidelines and \nselection criteria, and an enhanced regulatory framework for green energy. All parties stressed \nthe importance of long-term financing and the impact of its cost on the levelized cost2 of solar \nelectricity. Given the high up-front but low operating cost profile of solar power generation, the \nprofile, tenor, and cost of debt play a significant part in optimizing costs and viability; and have \nbeen the main focus of ADB\u2019s efforts in this area. \n \n4.  As the MNRE defined the details of the NSM program, it became clear to the project \nteam that the first phase projects would be relatively small (2 MW\u201325 MW), mostly solar \nphotovoltaic projects. Based on current cost estimates (about $3,000\u2013$3,300 per kilowatt of \ninstalled capacity), the total costs of such projects are likely to be too small for direct ADB \nlending. The challenge thus became how to support the financing of multiple \u201csmall\u201d solar \nprojects that would demonstrate their viability in the context of India\u2019s operating and climatic \nenvironment. ADB discussed various financing structures and support mechanisms with local \nand foreign commercial banks. Based on the feedback received from these banks, there is an \nimmediate window of opportunity for ADB to make a real impact in this nascent but critically \nimportant sector, by mobilizing available commercial funds into solar projects and building \ncapacity within the local banks on the technical and commercial risks of solar power projects. \nThis iterative consultation process led to the design of a multi-project partial credit guarantee \n(PCG) facility structured to provide long-term financing and share commercial risks between \nbanks and ADB for the first wave of solar projects. Commercial risk mitigation and extension of \ndebt tenors are critical to ensure the bankability and viability of, and to lay the groundwork for, a \nsustainable solar program. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

Manila (TA 7099-IND). \nThis ongoing TA will fulfill ADB\u2019s participation requirement for nonsovereign guarantee operations. \n2  Levelized cost refers to the present value of the total cost of constructing and operating a generating plant over its \neconomic life converted on an annual basis. \n ", "2    \n \nB.  Sector Background \n5.  As of October 2010, installed power generation capacity in India was 167,278 MW, \n64.9% of which is fired from thermal sources (coal and gas), 22.3% from hydropower, 2.7% \nfrom  nuclear  power,  and  10.0%  from  renewable  energy.  India\u2019s  growth  rates  in  energy \nconsumption  are  much  higher  than  the  gross  domestic  product  growth  rate,  reflecting  an \nincreasing share of energy investment. India\u2019s energy sector contributes about 58% of the \ncountry\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.3 \n \n6.  Solar energy is abundant in India, with high insolation measured at about 300 sunny \ndays on average per year4 and estimated to be 5 billion megawatt-hours (MWh) per year of \nenergy over India\u2019s land area. Most regions receive 4\u20137 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per square meter \n(m2) per day; the national average is 4.5 kWh/m2/day. This rate of insolation is among the \nhighest in the world, comparing favorably with Australia (4.7 kWh/m2/day) and ahead of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (3.4 kWh/m2/day) and Western Europe (2.9 kWh/m2/day).5 Effective \nunlocking of this huge potential, through photovoltaic or concentrating solar thermal power \ndevelopment, provides the ability to generate power on a distributed basis and enables rapid \ncapacity addition with relatively short lead times (e.g., less than 1 year). \n \n7.  From an energy independence and security perspective, solar is the most secure of all \nsources since it is renewable and abundantly available. Given the large number of poor and \nunserved people in India, all efforts need to be made to exploit this source of energy. Solar \nprojects can be flexibly sited within high insolation areas to avoid competing for scarce land that \nmay  have  other  productive  uses.  The  acquisition  of  land  has  become  a  major  hurdle  for \ninfrastructure development projects in India and other developing member countries (DMCs). \nWhile domestic coal-based power generation is the cheapest electricity source today, future \nscenarios  suggest  that  this  could  change.  Under  current  electricity  deficit  conditions  and \nlooming domestic coal shortages, peak energy prices could reach Rs8.50 per kWh ($0.18 per \nkWh) as the country begins to partly rely on imported coal to meet its energy demand. Given \nenergy shortages, India is increasing the use of diesel-based electricity, which is both expensive \n(up to Rs15.00 per kWh) and polluting.  \n \n8.  The NSM is an initiative of the central and state governments to promote ecologically \nsustainable energy growth while addressing India\u2019s energy security challenge. It will constitute a \nmajor contribution by India to the global effort to meet the challenges of climate change. The \nNSM helps implement some of India\u2019s objectives under the National Action Plan on Climate \nChange, which recognizes that solar energy\u2014because of India\u2019s tropical climate and abundant \nsunshine\u2014has great potential as a future energy source and will enable the decentralized \ndistribution of electricity production. However, solar power generation is the least developed \nform of renewable energy in India because of technical and financial challenges (Table 1). \n  \n                                                 \n3  Agence France-Presse, 2010.  \n4  Government of India, Ministry of Power, Central Electricity Authority. 2010.

Unfortunately, the total costs (capital and operating costs) for solar power generation are \ncurrently much higher than for thermal power stations, which are centralized and sized to reap \neconomies of scale (e.g., 2,000\u20134,000 MW). One of the objectives of the NSM is to create \nconditions (through a rapid scaling up of capacity, technological innovation, and indigenization) \nthat will drive down the capital costs of solar power generation toward grid parity.6 The NSM \naims to achieve grid parity (peak energy) by 2022 and parity with coal-fired thermal power by \n2030.  As  more  solar  capacity  is  installed  globally,  production  costs  for  panels  and  other \ncomponents  will  decrease  as  a  result  of  economies  of  scale  and  manufacturers  locating \nproduction facilities close to demand in Asia. This cost trajectory will depend on the scale and \npace of global deployment, technology development, and transfer of knowledge. Once solar \npower costs approach or reach grid parity, this will facilitate the deployment of smaller and more \ndistributed power generation stations that can serve more remote and nonurban locations where \nIndia\u2019s poor are concentrated. \n \n10.  The objective of the NSM is to establish India as a global leader in solar energy by \ncreating  the  policy  conditions  for  rapid  diffusion  of  technology  and  investment  across  the \ncountry. The NSM will adopt a three-phase approach, spanning the remaining period of the \nEleventh Five Year Plan, 2007\u201320127 and first year of the 12th plan (1,000-2,000 MW of utility-\nscale capacity by 2013) as phase 1; the remaining 4 years of the 12th plan as phase 2 (4,000\u2013\n10,000 MW added by 2017); and the 13th plan as phase 3 (20,000 MW by 2022). The NSM will \nevaluate  progress  against  plan  milestones  to  review  capacity  and  targets  for  subsequent \nphases based on emerging cost and technology trends, so as to protect the government from \nheavy subsidy exposure in case anticipated cost reductions do not materialize as expected. \n \n11.  NSM activities are currently embedded within the existing framework of the Electricity \nAct, 2003, but solar-specific regulatory frameworks and contractual arrangements are being \nestablished to facilitate its development. One of the key regulatory drivers for promoting solar \npower is a renewable purchase obligation (RPO) in which a minimum amount of electricity must \nbe purchased from clean energy sources by power distribution companies (e.g., varies from \n1.0% to 15.0% in Indian states at present). As required by the National Electricity Policy (2005), \nthe National Tariff Policy (2006) was amended by the cabinet in January 2011 to mandate that \nthe state electricity regulators specify a minimum amount of electricity generated by solar power \nthat must be purchased by power distribution companies. The solar power purchase obligation \nfor states will start at 0.25% no later than 2013 and increase up to 3.0% by 2022. \n \n                                                 \n6  Grid parity refers to the cost of electricity on an Indian rupee per kilowatt hour basis, which is equivalent to the \ncurrent market price for short-term power. \n7 Government of India, Planning Commission. 2008. Eleventh Five Year Plan, 2007\u201312. Delhi. \n ", "4    \n \n12.  The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) has issued detailed guidelines \nfor determining feed-in tariffs for solar power, taking into account current cost and technology \ntrends. These will be revised on an annual basis for new projects being commissioned (although \npresently fixed until the end of March 2012). This will be complemented by a renewable energy \ncertificate (REC) mechanism to allow utilities and solar power generation companies to buy and \nsell  certificates  to  meet  their  solar  power  purchase  obligations.  In  January  2010,  CERC \nannounced REC regulations that enable the interstate trading of such certificates to meet the \nRPOs. This will drive utility-scale renewable power generation, but it is not yet consistently in \nplace across all states\u2014representing a risk for solar project developers. The NSM offtake \nregime,  with  its  blended  tariff  structure,  is  therefore  critical  in  bridging  the  near-term \ncompetitiveness of solar with other renewable technologies. Short-term adoption is critical in \nachieving cost economies of scale and diffusing the technology in the long term. RPOs\u2019 of 1%\u2013\n15% of total power purchases have been established by 18 states based on renewable potential \nin the state. When NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam (NVVN) supplies bundled power to state utilities \nat the rates determined in accordance with CERC regulations, those state utilities will be entitled \nto use the solar part of the bundled power for meeting their RPOs under the Electricity Act, \n2003. Further information on India\u2019s National Solar Mission, power purchase schemes, and \nregulatory framework are in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n13.  The  facility  is  consistent  with  Strategy  2020,8 which  emphasizes  ADB  support  for \nenvironmentally  sustainable  development  and  private  sector  development.  The  facility  will \nexpand  ADB\u2019s  promotion  of,  and  investment  in,  sound  environmental  management  while \ncapitalizing on its operational strength, such as infrastructure development and finance. The \nstrategy seeks to meet the region\u2019s growing energy demand by helping DMCs to develop \nenvironmentally friendly technologies, specifically promoting energy efficiency and the use of \nclean energy sources. One of the key actions is to mitigate climate change by moving DMCs \nonto low-carbon growth paths by (i) improving energy efficiency, (ii) expanding the use of clean \nenergy  sources,  (iii)  reducing  fugitive  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  (iv)  modernizing  public \ntransport systems, and (v) arresting deforestation. In addition, one of Strategy 2020\u2019s goals is \nthat ADB\u2019s cofinanced lending will increase at a faster rate than ADB\u2019s stand-alone financing \noperations, with a long-term objective of total annual direct cofinancing exceeding the value of \nADB\u2019s stand-alone financing. The facility would be consistent with this cofinancing goal. \n \n2.  Consistency with the Country Strategy   \n14.  Approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in June 2009, the India country partnership \nstrategy, 2009\u20132012 emphasizes continued and sustained infrastructure development (e.g., \ntransport, energy, urban and water resource management).9 ADB\u2019s energy program in India \naims to enhance the impact of the government\u2019s initiatives for demand- and supply-related \nprograms.  The  planned  activities  include  (i)  developing  renewable  and  alternative  energy \nsources, and clean generation technology; (ii) reducing technical and commercial losses in \ntransmission  and  distribution  networks  and  facilities;  (iii)  strengthening  interregional \ntransmission capacity; (iv) bringing demand-side management and energy conservation into the \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2008.

Key thematic concerns include environmental sustainability, private \nsector development, private sector operations, governance, and partnerships.  \n \n15.  The facility complements the current lending and TA program by ADB\u2019s South Asia \nDepartment in support of solar power projects in India. There has been close cooperation \nbetween ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department and South Asia Department on the TA \nprogram with the MNRE. In addition, ADB is preparing a $100 million loan in support of a \n500 MW solar park being developed in the state of Gujarat. Additional TA is proposed for a \nsimilar  solar  park  in  the  state  of  Rajasthan  for  developing  solar  engineering  centers  of \nexcellence in local universities, funding of \u201csmart grid\u201d transmission management systems, and \nvocational educational programs in support of the solar industry in India.  \n \n3.  Consistency with the Sector Strategy \n16.  Under ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, ADB\u2019s investments will focus on energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy projects, as well as the expansion of energy access. Starting in 2013, ADB \nwill increase its target of clean energy investments to $2 billion a year from $1 billion, in a bid to \naccelerate low-carbon growth and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the region. 10  As part of \nthe policy implementation, ADB is emphasizing private sector participation as a tool to enhance \nenergy  sector  efficiency  as  a  result  of  introducing  increased  competition  and  increased \ninvestable resources. The objective is to create a framework that makes investing in the energy \nsector a commercially viable proposition and ADB is committed to facilitate direct private sector \nparticipation. \n \n17.  The facility is also directly aligned with ADB\u2019s Asia Solar Energy Initiative (ASEI) to \n(i) facilitate knowledge sharing and transfer for solar power; (ii) help develop, finance, and \ncommission 3,000 MW of solar power generation capacity in DMCs by May 2013; and (iii) pilot \ntest innovative financing mechanisms and risk mitigation measures specifically for solar power. \nThe ASEI seeks to stimulate solar power development in DMCs with the goal of (i) increasing \neconomies of scale to reduce costs and improve solar energy\u2019s competitiveness within the grid; \n(ii) exploiting select DMCs\u2019 solar radiation resources to service their fast-growing electricity \ndemand and utilize their greater availability of land compared with most developed countries; \nand (iii) promoting DMCs\u2019 potential to become global and regional manufacturing hubs for solar \ntechnology  goods  and  equipment.  ADB\u2019s  solar  initiatives  in  India  have  been  extensively \ncoordinated with the energy community of practice. \n \nIII.  THE FACILITY \nA.  Facility Description \n1.  Facility Rationale and Design \n18.  Commercial banks in India typically lend against fixed asset collateral or, if insufficient, \nagainst corporate guarantees as opposed to the cash flow and debt service capacity of the \nproject (i.e., project financing). Banks rely heavily on relationships with existing borrowers to \ngrow their lending business. This practice makes it difficult for new companies or borrowers to \nobtain financing on reasonable terms or without high collateralization. With solar projects being \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila.  \n ", "6    \n \nrelatively small and having some technical risks that cannot be easily mitigated at the present \ntime,  banks  remain  wary  of  lending  to  solar  projects  and/or  lending  beyond  their  existing \ncorporate relationships.   \n \n19.  The facility will help close these gaps by sharing credit risks with commercial lenders. \nSupported by parallel capacity development TA (para. 37), the facility has the twin objective of \n(i) making limited recourse debt financing available on reasonable terms and conditions, and \n(ii) extending the tenor of loans to solar projects to recoup the current high capital costs. ADB \nwould issue PCGs to international and local lenders to cover up to 50%11 of any nonpayment by \nthe borrowers. The PCGs would cover any default of scheduled repayments of principal and \naccrued interest. This is not a \u201cfirst loss\u201d guarantee, which would be paid prior to any loss \nsharing by the commercial banks; banks will incur losses alongside any ADB claims paid. \n \n2.  Project Borrowers and Sponsors \n20.  The projects to be supported under the facility are likely to be financed through special \npurpose vehicle companies (SPVs), established by project sponsors to build, own, and operate \nthe assets as a stand-alone independent power producer incorporated in India. Based on the \nindicative pipeline of projects (Appendix 3), the SPVs are sponsored by a mix of local and \nforeign investors with either experience as power sector operators in India or joint venture \nconsortia of financial investors and companies with solar power experience outside of India. The \nfacility will only be eligible for lenders to those SPVs in which 50% or more of the shares are \nowned by private sector companies and sponsored by investors with acceptable experience and \ncredit quality.  \n \n3.  Outcome and Outputs \n21.  The  outcome  will  be  the  demonstration  of  profitable  and  sustainable  solar  power \ngeneration plants under the National Solar Mission and/or state solar power policies. These \nprojects will diversify the country\u2019s energy mix, increase energy security, reduce reliance on \nfossil  fuels,  lower  imports  and  exposure  to  international  energy  prices  and  exchange  rate \nfluctuations, and decrease the emission of greenhouse gases as well as local pollutants. The \namount of carbon dioxide emissions reduced is one of the indicators for the outcome, in addition \nto financial and operation indicators.  \n \n22.  The facility will support the development of utility-scale, grid-connected solar power \nprojects in India through long-term commercial financing. The facility will mobilize lending and \ndevelop the capacity of commercial and partner banks to undertake technical due diligence on \nsolar projects and provide affordable longer-tenor loans, which are critical to their viability, \nsustainability, and replicability. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n   \nB.  Development Impact \n23.  Solar  power  is  most  appropriate  for  off-grid  and  distributed  electricity  generation \nbecause  of  its  modular  scalability  to  meet  small  loads,  ease  of  installation,  and  minimal \n                                                 \n11 Sharing of the risks between ADB and the commercial bank ensures an equitable balance and prevents against \nmoral hazard. This level of risk sharing is calculated on a present value basis over the life of the loan, which \nprovides flexibility for guarantees to be structured in different ways (either a constant guarantee scheme or a back-\nended scheme in which coverage is higher in the latter years of the loan) depending on the banks\u2019 preference. The \nnet present value of the guaranteed outstanding principal and accrued interest shall not exceed 50% of the total \nprincipal of the guaranteed loan. ", "7 \n \noperating and maintenance costs. As the cost of solar power equipment drops as a result of \neconomies of scale from indigenous production and development of local capacity, solar energy \nwill become more affordable, reliable, and accessible in the remote and underdeveloped areas \nof India. In essence, demand from utility-scale grid-connected solar projects in the first phase \nwill  lead  to  long-term  cost  reductions  for  solar  power  across  India,  including  for  off-grid \nconsumers who are often bypassed in terms of sharing the benefits of development.  \n \n24.  Significant capacity beyond a pilot scale needs to be developed and operated on a \ncommercial basis in the DMCs for solar power technology to scale up. It is expected that the \nfacility will directly leverage private sector investment for about 130 MW of projects, which would \nresult in 205 gigawatt-hours of electricity from solar energy added to the grid in India and \n1.76 million tons of carbon dioxide\u00a0abated during the first 10 years of operations. The facility \nimproves the financial viability of solar projects by extending the tenor of the loans without a \ncommensurate increase in lending margins. This will alleviate some pressure on project cash \nflows to service debt and as a result, improves the returns on the private sector investor\u2019s equity \nto an acceptable level. This effect will generate more investment in this nascent sector. Higher \nreturns on equity on the first projects would, in turn, allow electricity regulators to lower the feed-\nin tariff levels required in the future. \n \n25.  In the medium term, commercial banks that finance projects alongside ADB will become \nmore comfortable with solar power and have direct access to performance and operational data \nto understand the risks better. This will transform market risk perceptions and induce other \nbanks to lend to the sector without ADB support or (limited) recourse to the sponsor. This \nhypothesis can be compared with the evolution of the wind power sector in India since 2000. \nBanks initially had similar concerns on wind power resources and the unproven performance of \nwind energy turbines in India. Now with over 14,000 MW of wind power installed in India, local \ncommercial banks are more comfortable with the risks, understand technical parameters better, \nand offer long-term debt financing without recourse to parent companies. The same results can \nbe expected (e.g., longer tenors, lower margins) once there is a track record of solar operations. \nThe target of 4,000 MW of solar power in the second phase of the NSM (2013\u20132015) cannot be \nmet without similar developments in the project finance market. Performance indicators for the \nmedium-term  impacts  include  the  cumulative  solar  capacity  in  the  country  by  2015,  the \npercentage of solar projects financed on a non-recourse basis, and the project margins charged \nas compared with other renewable energy projects.   \n \n26.  In line with the ASEI, one of the long-term objectives is to reduce the capital costs for \nsolar power in DMCs. This can be accomplished in India once the manufacturing of solar power \ncomponents is indigenized and reaches economies of scale. Significant demand from projects \nfor capital equipment, solar panels and modules, and experienced contractors is a prerequisite \nto generate investment in local manufacturing. Based on a much lower cost of labor but strong \nengineering and technology base, there is significant scope for manufacturing cost reductions in \nIndia.  Local  manufacturing  will  reduce  the  price  of  solar  components  and  increase  the \ncompetitiveness of solar power with other sources of energy production. Establishing a large \ncommercial market in DMCs will stimulate global competition in the sector, further lowering \nprices and the cost of electricity production.  \n \nC.  Environment and Social Dimensions   \n27.  The facility is classified under category FI for environment, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The partner banks will be \nrequired to establish and adopt an appropriate environmental and social management system \n ", "8    \n \n(ESMS). Implementation of the ESMS will ensure that the projects meet ADB\u2019s safeguard \nrequirements on environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The partner \nbanks will appoint suitably qualified officers to oversee environmental and social aspects of the \noperations and the day-to-day implementation of the ESMS.  \n \n28.  For  this  type,  size,  and  nature  of  project,  no  significant  environmental  impacts  are \nexpected. The solar power developers are required to implement mitigating measures and good \nconstruction management practice. The occupational health and safety performance of the \ncontractors and their workers will be closely monitored during construction. ADB will coordinate \nwith the partner banks to ensure that an ESMS satisfactory to ADB has been adopted prior to \nADB issuing a guarantee for the first project. \n \n29.  Most solar projects are being sited on barren or unproductive government land in a \ncoordinated effort by state governments. Each 5 MW solar power plant will require about \n12 hectares of land. No physical displacement is expected since lands can be flexibly acquired \nto avoid impacts on existing villages and communities. The solar power plants will typically \nutilize the existing distribution substations and will be connected to the state electricity grid. If \nextensions of transmission lines are required, these are expected to be established along \nexisting public road rights-of-way. Potential impacts on indigenous peoples and/or scheduled \ntribes will only be ascertained once specific sites for each solar power plant are identified. \nHowever, since barren and unproductive lands will be used, the impacts on scheduled tribes, if \nany, are unlikely to be significant. \n \n30.  Other social dimensions (e.g., gender, labor issues) of each solar power project will be \nanalyzed as part of the environmental and social assessment to be undertaken by each SPV in \naccordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement and the ESMS of partner banks. The summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 4 and a summary ESMS is in Appendix 5. \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n31.  With over 700 MW awarded to project sponsors in December 2010 through the National \nSolar  Mission  and  an  additional  965  MW  allocated  by  the  state  government  of  Gujarat \n(Appendix 3), total investment costs over the next 3 years in the sector are about $4.5 billion \nequivalent. Assuming a debt\u2013equity ratio of 70:30 as prescribed by the CERC tariff guidelines, \n$3.2  billion  equivalent  of  debt  financing  will  be  required.  Even  if  only  half  those  projects \nmaterialize ($1.6 billion in debt), significant demand for financing from ADB and the facility is \nlikely. The facility has been conservatively sized at $150 million to support 12\u201315 projects \nbetween 2011 and 2014, which would represent a reasonable sample of first projects to be \nfinanced. Should there be additional demand for guarantees prior to the end of the 3-year \navailability period, ADB can propose extending the facility through additional financing. \n \n32.  The  estimated  investment  cost  for  projects  to  be  supported  under  the  facility  is \n$429 million equivalent and assumes (i) a project debt\u2013equity ratio of no greater than 70:30; and \n(ii) a guaranteed percentage of 50% on the total debt of the projects. ADB PCGs would, \ntherefore, cover up to $300 million equivalent of commercial loans to projects from domestic and \ninternational commercial bank lenders. The remainder of funding will come from equity and \nsubordinated debt (or like instruments). \n ", "9 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n33.  The facility can issue PCGs over a 3-year period following Board approval. PCGs will be \nlimited to a maximum tenor of 15 years (18 years may be considered only in exceptional cases, \nas determined by ADB in its sole discretion). Additional sub-facility limits on partner banks, \nsponsors, and projects are specified below. Any exceptions or changes to these implementation \narrangements will require the prior approval of the Investment Committee.  \n \n1.  Selection and Approval of Partner Commercial Banks \n34.   Local and/or foreign partner banks will be selected at ADB\u2019s sole discretion. Initially, no \nmore than five partner banks will be selected. Any additions to the number of proposed partner \nbanks will be submitted to the Investment Committee for endorsement (It is proposed that the \nboard of directors delegate approval authority for partner banks to the Investment Committee). \nADB will require that each prospective lender submit all documentation and information as \noutlined in the due diligence checklist (Appendix 6). Prospective partner banks will be screened \nand due diligence results presented to the Investment Committee for approval based on the \nfollowing factors: (i) credit standing (at least BBB\u2013 equivalent credit rating by an international \nrating agency or AA equivalent credit rating by a local rating agency);12 (ii) experience and \ncapabilities in limited recourse lending in India and/or Asia; (iii) existing portfolio in the power \nsector; (iv) willingness and ability to make financial commitments in renewable energy required \nunder the facility; (v) senior management commitment; (vi) staffing, management, and technical \ncapability to implement the facility; and (vii) operating policies, guidelines, and systems in loan \norigination, credit assessment, and loan administration and enforcement. No more than 40% of \nthe entire facility can be consumed by PCGs issued to the same partner bank.  \n \n2.  Selection and Approval of Projects \n35.  Projects  will  be  identified  and  selected  by  partner  banks  based  on  customary  due \ndiligence  on  project  preparation,  financial  and  commercial  viability,  adequate  sponsor \ncredentials  and  creditworthiness,  and  overall  project  risk  mitigation.  Projects  will  then  be \nscreened against eligibility criteria (Appendix 7), and banks will need to submit a due diligence \nreport to ADB that meets all the requirements, including the projects\u2019 compliance with ADB\u2019s \npolicies on anticorruption, safeguards, integrity, and procurement. Projects must have signed a \nlong-term power purchase agreement either with the NVVN (under the National Solar Mission \nframework) or in compliance with an approved state solar power policy. Individual state policies \nwill be reviewed on a case-by-case basis before PCGs are issued.13 The net present value of \nthe outstanding guaranteed principal and accrued guaranteed interest shall not exceed 50% of \nthe total principal of the guaranteed loan. Guarantees with the same sponsor or parent company \nof the SPVs shall be limited to no more than five projects or an aggregate of 30 MW, whichever \nlimit  is  reached  first.  These  limits  will  ensure  a  diversified  portfolio  across  partner  banks, \nsponsors, and projects.  \n \n                                                 \n12 International credit ratings to be from Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P), Moody\u2019s, or Fitch Ratings; local credit ratings to be \nfrom CRISIL (an S&P company), Investment Information and Credit Rating Agency (ICRA), or Credit Analysis and \nResearch Limited (CARE). \n13 The project team has conducted due diligence on the solar power policy in Gujarat, the regulatory norms, the credit \nstanding of the offtaker, and the template form of power purchase agreement.  \n ", "10    \n \n3.  Reporting and Monitoring \n36.  Partner banks will be required to notify ADB promptly of any loan default. Banks will be \nrequired to continuously monitor the performance of the project loans and submit annual reports \nto  ADB  that  include  information  on  disbursements  and  repayments,  construction  progress, \nproject  operating  performance  (as  against  baseline  conditions),  and  quarterly  and  annual \nfinancial  statements,  the  latter  having  been  audited  in  compliance  with  Indian  national \nstandards. ADB will monitor the use of the PCG, portfolio quality, and compliance with ADB \neligibility requirements. ADB will regularly monitor the credit quality of partner banks (through \nexisting credit rating reports), and will conduct a review for any partner banks that are placed on \nnegative credit watch by major credit rating agencies or have their credit rating downgraded. \nADB will carry out an annual performance review of the facility to assess the average risk rating \nof the portfolio and monitor the performance of the facility against indicators in the design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \n4.  Technical Assistance \n37.  ADB is preparing separate parallel TA that will build capacity and provide technical \nsupport to the partner banks during the due diligence of private sector solar power projects. \nADB  will  engage  international  engineering  consultants  to  provide  expertise  and  hands-on \nsupport to partner banks as they conduct due diligence on individual projects. The consultants \nwill advise the partner banks in the areas of solar technology, insolation and irradiance studies, \nsolar panel manufacturers, and performance warranties. Consultants will also be engaged to \nconduct periodic training for commercial banks and other stakeholders in several locations \nacross India during the implementation period of the facility. ADB is coordinating the first set of \ntraining sessions with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, part of the US Department of \nEnergy. \n  \n5.  Anticorruption Policy  \n38.  The partner banks will be advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) and Policy on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). \nConsistent with ADB\u2019s commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, the \nguarantee and/or loan documentation will require the project borrowers to institute, maintain, \nand comply with internal procedures and controls following international best practice standards \nfor the purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of \nterrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  The  legal \ndocumentation will further allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these \nundertakings. \n \nF.  Projected Operational and Financial Performance \n39.   While partner banks will be primarily responsible for carrying out due diligence on the \nprojects, ADB has carried out financial and economic analysis of a representative project to \nassess its viability and sustainability under different funding and operating scenarios. These \nresults were used to structure the type and tenor of the guarantee. The financial internal rate of \nreturn of projects under CERC tariffs would be 13.2% and the weighted average cost of capital \nis projected to be 7.8%. The economic internal rate of return would be 20.5%, which is above \nADB\u2019s  standard  discount  rate.  The  economic  and  financial  analysis  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A.  \n ", "11 \n \nG.  Guarantee Pricing \n40.  The cost of financing14 is critical to the financial viability of solar power projects (and the \nunderlying feed-in tariff). Approximately 85% of the total costs (capital and operations) over the \nproject\u2019s economic life are financed up front. This is unlike financing for a thermal power project, \nwhere only 30% of the total costs are financed up front (the remainder are fuel and recurrent \ncosts, which are financed annually through cash flow generated by operations). Without the \nlending  experience  or  installed  capacity  to  prove  performance,  banks  will  assign  high  risk \nratings to these projects and commensurate lending margins. The PCGs effectively replace a \nportion of the project risk, as assessed by the lender, with ADB\u2019s AAA credit rating. This risk \nmitigation will help reduce loan margins required by the partner commercial banks. The PCGs \ncan incentivize banks to reduce the cost of debt, provided that the PCG fees do not consume \nthe savings created by the guarantee\u2019s risk sharing structure. Guarantee pricing has been set in \nline with market benchmarks, and will vary within a set band based on exposure size and tenor. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n1.  Instrument and Amount \n41.  The  facility  will  provide  for  ADB  to  issue  PCGs  in  an  aggregate  amount  of  up  to \n$150 million of principal (or its equivalent in Indian rupees or other foreign currency acceptable \nto ADB15) in favor of foreign and local commercial banks lending to solar power generation \nprojects in India that meet the minimum eligibility criteria (Appendix 7). Under the facility, ADB \nwill issue PCGs to guarantee scheduled payments of principal and interest under loans to be \nprovided by foreign or local commercial banks. The PCGs will be provided without government \ncounter-guarantee.  The  facility  will  partially  cover  payment  default  risk  on  loans  made  by \napproved  partner  banks  to  private  sector  borrowers  in  India  implementing  solar  power \ngeneration  projects  as  awarded  under  the  National  Solar  Mission  or  an  approved  state \ngovernment solar power policy.  \n  \n2.  Terms and Conditions \n42.  A guarantee term sheet template has been presented to prospective partner banks and \na summary term sheet template is in Appendix 7. The guarantee agreement to be entered into \nwith  respective  partner  banks  will  ensure  that  the  net  present  value  of  the  outstanding \nguaranteed principal and accrued guaranteed interest shall not exceed 50% of the total principal \nof the guaranteed loan. The facility will be available for 3 years from Board approval, with \nproject loans having a maximum tenor of up to 15 years (exceptional consideration of tenors of \nup to 18 years subject to agreement by ADB). A guaranteed loan may be made in Indian rupees \nor any foreign currency that is acceptable to the lender and ADB. The Investment Committee \ndetermines up-front fees, standby fees, and guarantee fees. \n \n3.  Compliance with Investment Limitations  \n43.  The  proposed  facility  will  be  within  the  country,  industry,  group,  and  single  project \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n                                                 \n14  Inclusive of up-front arrangement fees, commitment fees, margins over the cost of funds, and any guarantee fees. \n15 Guarantees issued in currencies other than U.S. dollars will be adjusted on a quarterly basis to ensure the \nproposed ceiling amount for the Facility limit shall not be breached. \n ", "12    \n \n \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n44.  While solar power technologies have been commercially proven in developed markets \nsuch as Germany, Spain, and the United States, there was only 11 MW of installed capacity in \nIndia as of December 2010 (mostly installed in 2010). 16  Lenders remain concerned about the \nrisks of solar technology performance, unproven indigenization of the technology to India\u2019s \nclimatic conditions, and the nascent stage of regulatory development with respect to renewable \nand specifically solar energy. ADB\u2019s participation as a guarantor will help mitigate risks and \nleverage commercial funds into a new subsector in India. The facility leverages commercial \nbank loans and builds capacity at the appropriate institutions that can apply such knowledge \nand lessons to future lending in India.  \n \n45.  ADB\u2019s support for the facility is justified based on the following: \n(i)  ADB assistance will play a crucial role in helping solar projects close affordable \nlong-term financing, which is a necessary condition for the viability of a solar \nproject. As a result of the recent banking crisis, liquidity remains limited, and local \nbanks can rarely provide clean (or uncovered) loans for more than 8\u201310 years \nwithout recourse to project sponsors. Tenors required for solar power generation \nprojects are typically longer than other energy projects.17 ADB\u2019s PCG will share \nproject risks with banks (to reduce the cost of financing) and extend commercial \nbank tenors to fund power generation plants that have high up-front investment \ncosts, but no recurrent fuel cost. Without the cover provided by ADB\u2019s PCG, \nprojects may obtain finance but they will do so with the inevitable condition of \nhaving to seek refinancing after commissioning when operational performance \nhas been proven. This is a cost-inefficient process that can be mitigated more \nappropriately through up-front risk-sharing arrangements. \n \n(ii)  Sponsors or developers of solar power projects expect that ADB\u2019s participation in \nthe financing will trigger local and/or international bank participation, additional \nequity investment, and further interest in the financing of solar projects. ADB\u2019s \nPCG in particular encourages the commitment of local commercial banks, which \nhave little experience in solar energy. \n \n(iii)  The facility will play a pioneering role in demonstrating the commercial viability of \ngrid-connected solar photovoltaic technology in India. The projects will be among \nthe first grid-connected power generation projects with a commercial component \nunder the NSM or state schemes. Once solar power performance under Indian \nclimatic conditions is proven, this will catalyze the deployment of larger-scale solar \nprojects  (important  to  generate  sufficient  demand  for  local  manufacturing  and \neconomies of scale) and increase foreign private sector investment. \n \n(iv)  The facility directly achieves the strategies outlined by ADB\u2019s energy community of \npractice in the ASEI for mainstreaming solar projects through (i) supporting the \n                                                 \n16  This figure incorporates recently commissioned solar projects according to project developers and investors.  \n17  In 2010, the ADB Board of Directors approved long-term loans for two solar power generation projects in Thailand. \nADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and \nAdministration of Grant for the Solar Power Project in Thailand. Manila (loan tenor of 18 years); ADB. 2010.

", "13 \n \ndesign of appropriate policy frameworks and institutional capacity development for \nrapid  diffusion  of  solar  energy  technology  for  power  generation;  (ii)  creating \ninnovative financing mechanisms and risk mitigation measures to encourage solar \npower generation; and  (iii) facilitating the  development  of large capacity solar \nprojects that drive down solar generation costs toward grid parity. \n \n(v)  Direct ADB lending to solar projects may not always be practical, given the small \nsize and short development and implementation timetable. The central or state \ngovernment issues a solar power tariff order within the CERC guidelines and \ninvites investors to tender for allocations based on qualifications, ability to acquire \nland and close financing. Investors must then deposit funds (scaled based on \nproject capacity) into a government account to secure their performance. They are \ngiven a limited timeline (90\u2013180 days) to acquire land, sign the power purchase \nagreement (PPA), and close financing. The investors\u2019 performance funds would be \nforfeited if the deadlines are breached. It has proven difficult on other projects for \nADB to complete its appraisal and process the transaction within this time frame. \nThe facility is designed to work with partner commercial banks on a streamlined \nbasis to meet financial close within the time lines. \n \nC.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n46.  The  facility  involves  risks  with  respect  to  partner  commercial  banks  and,  as  the \nguarantees will be project-specific, to the projects themselves. While not an exhaustive list of \nrisks, the following key issues have been examined and mitigated as appropriate: \n \n(i)  Technology risk. Photovoltaic solar panel technologies are still in the innovation \nstage and are rapidly changing, and often owned by companies with limited track \nrecord  and  weaker  credit  quality.    Moreover,  solar  panel  technologies  have \nvarying track record in terms of efficiency and degradation rates.  This risk is \nmitigated to some extent by the eligibility criteria established for the selection of \nequipment manufacturers based on their operating track record and installed \ncapacity. ADB consultants under the parallel TA will help validate these risks.  In \naddition,  more  stringent  performance  and cash  flow  stress  scenarios  will  be \napplied to the base case projections to ascertain debt servicing ability.   \n \n(ii)  Sponsor risk.  The projects\u2019 key risks, i.e., technology, limited track record of \nequipment manufacturers, the nascent solar power sector in India, substantial \nlong-term exposures, and relatively high leverage (i.e., up to 70% of the project \ncosts), will be partially mitigated by the sponsors\u2019 guarantee for completion of the \nproject.  Given the critical role of the sponsors, certain eligibility criteria related to \nthe sponsor\u2019s experience in the sector, the sponsor\u2019s equity investment in the \nproject, and solvency and liquidity ratios have been included in the program.   \n \n(iii)  Offtaker risk.  Projects will be exposed to nonpayment and/or non-dispatch risk \nfrom the SEBs or defaults from NVVN. Through existing TA support, ADB has \nbeen advising MNRE on drafting of the NVVN PPA, and based on continued \ndialogue  with  banks  and  developers,  the  bankability  of  the  PPA  has  been \nimproved as a result, including the security provisions and step-in rights for the \nlenders. There is divergence in the credit profiles of the solar power offtakers for \nthe projects being considered under the proposed facility.  The NSM projects \nbenefit from much lower offtaker risks as NVVN, has a reasonably strong credit \n ", "14    \n \nprofile. On the other hand, state government supported solar power projects may \nface higher offtaker risks given the weak credit profile of the state electricity \nboards. The PPAs signed with GUVNL have a slightly different tariff structure, \nwhich  somewhat  reduces  the  payment  burden  on  distribution  utilities  and  is \nexpected to reduce the risk of PPA renegotiation. In addition, the PPA includes \ncompensation payments equivalent to 3 years of revenue in the event of default \nor termination, which may act as a deterrent but may not essentially mitigate the \nunderlying  credit  risks.  In  addition,  the  program  aims  to  diversify  exposures \nacross various offtakers by including exposure limits.  \n \n(iv)  Regulatory risk. The regulatory environment pertaining to solar power in India is \nstill evolving and may change over the course of the program and adversely \naffect the viability of the projects. The central and state governments have shown \na significant commitment to promote electricity supply from renewable energy \nsources (for energy supply diversification as well as climate change motivations) \nby introducing the RPO requirement, the percentage of which increases every \nyear. The National Tariff Policy was amended in January 2011 to enact solar-\nspecific RPOs as well, demonstrating the political will to support the National \nSolar Mission. Some state regulators introduced solar RPO requirements even \nbefore the policy was amended. Purchases from solar power are exempted from \nmarket dispatch orders by state regulators (i.e., \u201cmust run\u201d status). That said, it is \nvery likely that comparable solar technology would be more efficient and cheaper \nin the medium-to-long-term.  This would decrease the competitive standing of the \npresent pipeline of projects, which require higher tariffs to recover the higher \ntechnology  and  investment  costs.    This  would  thus  expose  the  underlying \nprojects  and  ADB  to  regulatory  risks  as  offtakers  may  seek  to  renegotiate \ncontracts and tariffs.  As the credit profile of most of the state offtakers is already \nstressed from under-recovery of costs for conventional power, the incentive-\nbased payments required to establish the viability of solar photovoltaic or solar \nthermal power projects may add to their financial burden and over time, increase \nthe risks of nonpayment under contracted terms.  This is mitigated by the strong \ncommitment  of  the  Government  of  India  to  solar  power  projects  with  the \nintroduction of very robust regulatory framework.    \n \n(v)  Risk  sharing with  partner  banks.  The project borrowers will ultimately be \nresponsible for loan repayment. However, there is risk that they will be unable to \nservice the guaranteed loans. By carefully selecting each partner bank, ADB will \nensure that appropriate credit assessment and due diligence is carried out before \nany guaranteed loan is advanced. The proposed facility may provide a back-\nended guarantee structure, with ADB providing up to 100% cover to the partner \nbanks on the default risk of the underlying projects. For these projects, there are \nconcerns as it may trigger a sense of complacency in the due diligence, project \nselection  and  exposure  monitoring  activities  of  the  partner  banks  under  the \ncomfort that ADB will eventually absorb all the credit losses in the latter years of \nthe  loan  tenor.  This  concern  is  aggravated  by  the  partner  banks\u2019  limited \nexperience in financing solar power in India and the expectations that over time, \nADB will reduce its involvement in the project assessment process. To align the \ninterests of the partner banks with that of ADB and incentivize the partner banks \nto exercise risk discipline in its approval and monitoring process, it was agreed \nthat  ADB\u2019s  100%  cover  will  be  limited  to  the  tail  end  of  the  loan  and  the ", "15 \n \nguarantee fee would be structured such that partner banks have an incentive to \nconsider continued financial support to the projects on a stand-alone basis.   \n \n(vi)  Lack  of  technical  expertise  of  partner  banks  in  the  evaluation  of  solar \npower projects.  The potential partner banks\u2019 have limited technical expertise in \nthe evaluation of solar power projects. Although the parallel TA would help build \ntheir internal capacity, these benefits may only be realized in the medium term, \nwhile the build up of exposure under the facility may occur at a more rapid pace. \nSome foreign banks operating in India may have some experience in the sector; \nhowever, they may not have an in-depth knowledge of the sponsors and the \nregulatory framework in the country. To mitigate this, operating arrangements \nhave been established such that ADB will be actively involved in the selection of \nprojects by each of the banks, and in the initial transactions, this involvement \nwould be more detailed until confidence is established with the partner bank\u2019s \nproject selection abilities.  \n \n(vii)  Selection  of  partner  banks.    ADB  will  rely  on  the  partner  banks  for  the \nselection, structuring, and monitoring of the projects.  Although broad criteria has \nbeen established for the selection of partner banks, there is a need for ADB to \nconduct  a  more  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  risk  profile  of  local \ncommercial banks (i.e., those without an international credit rating).  Although \nADB will not be exposed to any direct credit risk on the partner banks, any \ndistress in their financial condition would divert resources and may reduce their \noversight over the projects covered under the facility. This aspect is critical given \nthe long-dated maturity and the proposed back-ended guarantee scheme.  This \nrisk will be mitigated by the detailed evaluation of the credit profile of potential \nlocal partner commercial banks both at the initial selection stage and on an \nannual basis.     \n \nD.  Assurances \n47.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment of India will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed facility. \nADB will enter into suitable guarantee agreements and other required legal documents once the \nproposed facility is approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors and the individual partner banks are \napproved by ADB\u2019s Investment Committee. These agreements will be on terms and conditions \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n48.  I am satisfied that the proposed guarantee facility would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nguarantee  facility  for  ADB  to  issue  partial  credit  guarantees  without  government  counter-\nguarantee, in amounts, in aggregate, of up to $150,000,000 (or its equivalent in Indian rupees or \nother foreign currency acceptable to ADB) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in favor of \neligible foreign and local commercial banks lending to solar power generation projects in India, \nwith such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this \nreport, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda  \n ", "16    \n \nPresident  \n \n17 March 2011 \n ", "Appendix 1    17 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions  \nDesign Summary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nSuccessful  1,100 MW of solar  Ministry of New and  Stable and consistent \nimplementation of  capacity  Renewable Energy  regulatory policies for the \nphase 1 of the NSM  commissioned by  statistics  renewable energy sector \n  2011;

", "Appendix 2      19 \nINDIA\u2019S NATIONAL SOLAR MISSION \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  The current power generation capacity in India is insufficient to meet demand. According \nto the Central Electricity Authority, the energy shortage in 2010\u20132011 is expected to be 10.6% \n(93 terawatt-hours) and the corresponding peak load deficit is expected to be 12.1% (the \nequivalent energy of 15 gigawatts).1 For annual gross domestic product growth of 8%, it is \nestimated that India will have to double its current installed capacity to over 300 gigawatts by \n2017.2 \n \n2.  Fossil fuels dominate the power generation mix, with coal accounting for over 50% of the \npower generation capacity in India. The total installed power generation capacity in India in \nOctober 2010 was 167,278 megawatts (MW). Of this, 64.9% was fossil fuel fired power plants \n(coal, gas, and diesel); 22.3% hydropower; 2.7% nuclear power; and 10% renewable energy.3 \nIndia\u2019s energy sector contributes about 58% of the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.4 India \nis implementing a National Action Plan on Climate Change that suggests that 15% of energy \ncould come from renewable sources by 2020. \n \n3.  India has vast solar energy potential. About 5 billion megawatt-hours (MWh) per year of \nenergy exist over India\u2019s land area, with most regions receiving 4\u20137 kilowatt-hours per square \nmeter (kWh/per m2) per day, averaging 4.5 kWh/m2/day nationally. This rate of insolation is \namong the highest in the world, comparing favorably with Australia (4.7 kWh/m2/day) and ahead \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China (3.4 kWh/m2/day) and Western Europe (2.9 kWh/m2/day).5 \nEffective unlocking of this potential will enable rapid capacity addition with relatively short lead \ntimes (e.g., less than 1 year) and no additional greenhouse gas emissions. Unfortunately, the \ntotal costs (capital and operating costs) for solar power generation are currently significantly \nhigher that thermal power stations, which are centralized and sized (e.g., 2,000\u20134,000 MW) to \nreap economies of scale. \n \n4.  The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (NSM), launched in January 2010, is an \ninitiative  of  the  central  and  state  governments  to  promote  ecologically  and  economically \nsustainable growth in solar power generation by creating an enabling policy and regulatory \nframework. The NSM is one of eight national missions outlined in the National Action Plan on \nClimate Change.6 \n \nB.  Objectives and Targets \n \n5.  The objective of the NSM is to establish India as a global leader in solar energy by \ncreating the policy conditions for its diffusion across the country as quickly as possible. The \nimmediate aim of the mission is to focus on setting up an enabling environment for penetration \nof  solar  technology  in  the  country  both  at  centralized  (utility-scale,  grid-connected)  and \ndecentralized (off-grid, rural electricity supply) levels.

To achieve the NSM objective, it is critical to create a policy and regulatory environment \nthat  provides  a  predictable  incentive  structure  that  enables  rapid  and  large-scale  capital \ninvestment in solar energy applications and encourages technological innovation and lowering \nof costs. NSM activities are currently embedded within the existing framework of the Electricity \nAct,  2003;  National  Electricity  Policy,  2005;  and  the  National  Tariff  Policy,  2006  (and  as \namended in December 2010). However, in the long run, sector-specific legal and regulatory \nframeworks will be established for the development of solar power. \n \n1.   Electricity Act, 2003 \n \n7.  The Electricity Act, 2003 has been a major step toward liberalizing the power market in \nIndia along the value chain, encouraging competition and attracting private investment. Under \nthe act\u2019s part VII section 61(h), the promotion of cogeneration and electricity generation from \nrenewable sources is identified as a consideration in the establishment of tariff regulations, \nallowing the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) to establish a preferential tariff \nfor renewable energy.8 Further, the \u201copen access\u201d provision allows licensed renewable energy \npower generators access to transmission lines and distribution systems and only requires that \nthe generators pay a wheeling charge for the use of the transmission lines and a fee to the load \ndispatch center. \n \n2.  National Electricity Policy, 2005 \n \n8.  The National Electricity Policy, 2005, stipulates the need for increasing the share of \nelectricity  from  nonconventional  sources  and  allows  for  the  state  electricity  regulatory \ncommissions (SERCs) to establish a preferential tariff for electricity generated from renewable \nsources to enable them to be cost-competitive.9 Section 5.12.3 of the policy encourages the \ndevelopment of cogeneration facilities and allows for SERCs to promote arrangements between \n                                                 \n7  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2008.

National Tariff Policy, 2006 \n \n9.  The National Tariff Policy announced in January 2006 mandates each SERC to specify \na renewable purchase obligation (RPO) with distribution companies in a time-bound manner. \nThese purchases are to be made through a competitive bidding process. The objective of this \npolicy  is  to  enable  renewable  energy  technologies  to  compete  with  conventional  sources. \nSection  6.4  of  the  National  Tariff  Policy  calls  for  the  relevant  commission  to  establish \npreferential  tariffs  with  distribution  companies  for  the  purchase  of  electricity  from  non-\nconventional technologies.10 The National Tariff Policy mandates that each SERC specify RPOs \nby distribution companies in a time-bound manner. Given the magnitude and importance of the \nactivities  under  the  NSM,  solar-specific  amendments  have  been  made  to  these  RPOs.  In \nJanuary 2011, the union cabinet approved the proposal from the Ministry of Power to amend the \nNational Tariff Policy to fix a percentage of energy purchase from solar power under the RPOs. \nThe solar power purchase obligation for the states will start at 0.25% (by 2013) and increase up \nto 3% by 2022. \n \n4.  Renewable Purchase Obligations \n \n10.  As of December 2010, 18 states have established RPOs or have draft regulations under \nconsideration (Table A2.2) with RPO requirements ranging from 1% to 15% of total electricity \ngeneration. Solar RPOs have also been specified in most cases, and it is expected that the \nstate level tariff orders will be modified to conform to the minimum solar power purchase \nobligations specified by the Ministry of Power. \n \nTable A2.2: State Renewable Purchase Obligations \n \nState  Order date  RPO (per annum)  Solar RPO (per annum) \nAndhra Pradesh  6 Jul 10  5%  0.25% \nBihar  2 Aug 10  1.5% (for FY2011, 2.5% for FY2012,  0.25% (for FY2011, 0.5% for FY2012, \n4.0% for FY2013)  0.75% for FY2013) \nChhattisgarh  9 Nov 10  5% (for FY2011, 5.25% for FY2012,  0.25% (for FY2011-FY2013) \n5.5% for FY2013) \nGujarat  17 Apr 10  5% (for FY2011, 6% for FY2012, 7%  0.25%  (0.5%  in  FY2012;  1%  in \nfor FY2013)  FY2013) \nHaryana  8 Jul 10  1%  0.25% (for FY2011; 3% for FY2022) \nHimachal  12 Mar 10  10.1% (annual increase of 1% until  0.1% (until FY2013) \nPradesh  FY2013) \nKarnataka  11 Feb 08  10%   \nKerala  23 Nov 10  3%  (for  FY2010,  with  annual  0.25% \nincrease of 0.3% until a maximum \nRPO of 10%) \nMadhya Pradesh  7 Nov 08  10%   \nMaharashtra  3 Mar 10  6%  (annual  increase  of  1%  until  0.25% (for FY2011\u2013FY2013; 0.5% for \nFY2014;  9%  for  FY2015  and  FY2014\u2013FY2016) \n                                                 \n10 Ministry of Power. 2010.

Tradable Renewable Energy Credits \n \n11.  The availability of renewable energy sources differs across states. In some states (such \nas Delhi), the potential for harnessing renewable energy compared with the demand for energy \nis very small. In other states such as Tamil Nadu (wind), Rajasthan (solar) or Himachal Pradesh \n(hydro), it is very high. This variability offers opportunities for interstate trading in the form of \nrenewable energy credits (RECs). \n \n12.  In  January  2010,  CERC  announced  the  terms  and  conditions  for  a  tradable  REC \nprogram. Under this program, the renewable energy generators will have two options: (i) sell the \nrenewable  energy  at  a  preferential  tariff  fixed  by  the  concerned  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission, or (ii) sell the electricity generated and the environmental attributes associated \nwith the generation, separately.11 On choosing the second option, the environmental attributes \ncan be exchanged in the form of a REC. The price of the electricity component would be \nequivalent to the weighted average purchase cost to the distribution company, including short-\nterm power purchase but excluding renewable power purchase cost. CERC will issue the RECs \nand the value of one REC will be equivalent to 1 MWh of electricity delivered to the grid from \nrenewable energy sources. \n\u00a0\n13.  The RECs can be traded only on power exchanges approved by CERC within the band \nof a floor price and a ceiling price to be determined by CERC.

The NSM promotes a more affordable tariff through a power purchase agreement (PPA) \nframework that bundles solar power with unallocated thermal power produced by the National \nThermal Power Corporation (NTPC).12 NTPC will then sell the power to the state electricity \nboards (SEBs) through NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam (NVVN)\u2014NTPC\u2019s power trading subsidiary \n(Figure A2.1). In February 2010, CERC announced a feed-in tariff for FY2011 of Rs17.9 per \nkWh for photovoltaic and Rs15.3 per kWh for concentrated solar power, and declared that the \nPPAs would have a validity of 25 years. When NVVN supplies bundled power to state utilities at \nthe rates determined in accordance with CERC regulations, those state utilities will be entitled to \nuse the solar part of the bundled power for meeting their RPOs under the Electricity Act, 2003. \n \n                                                 \n12 NTPC is a regulated central power utility, majority owned by the Government of India. While 85% of the capacity of \nits power plants is contracted through long-term PPAs, 15% is reserved by the Ministry of Power to be allocated \nand sold by the NTPC to energy-deficient states on an annual basis. This is considered NTPC\u2019s \u201cunallocated\u201d \npower. \n ", "24    Appendix 2 \nFigure A2.1: Power Sales and Power Purchase Agreement Architecture \n \nSER C s \n\uf08d  \uf08e\n  1,000 MW Thermal \nNTPC  1,000 MW Thermal \nRPO Obligation \nSingle PPA  + \n1,000 MW Solar \n \n\uf08c  NVVN  SEB s \n  Solar  1,000 MW Solar \n \n  (e.g., multiple projects) \nSPVs \nMultiple PPAs \nPayment \nEquity  Debt  Security \nMechanism \n Inves to rs   Lend e rs \n \n \nNTPC = National Thermal Power Corporation, NVVN = NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam, PPA = power purchase \nagreement, RPO = renewable purchase obligation, SEB = state electricity board, SERC = state electricity regulatory \ncommission, SPV = special purpose vehicle. \nSource: MNRE. \n \n15.  In  addition  to  NVVN,  certain  states  such  as  Gujarat  have  developed  a  regulatory \nframework for solar power. In Gujarat, the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission devised a \nsolar power procurement tariff regime. Under this regime, Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited \n(GUVNL) will enter into 25-year power purchase agreements with private developers for offtake \nof solar power. The tariff will be fixed at Rs15 per kWh for the first 12 years and Rs5 per kWh for \nthe  remaining  13  years.  The  GUVNL  PPA  includes  several  notable  aspects,  including \ntermination payments under certain events of default. \n \nD.  Institutional Arrangements for Implementing the National Solar Mission \n \n16.  It is envisaged that the NSM will be implemented by an autonomous Solar Energy \nAuthority embedded within the existing structure of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. \nThe authority secretariat will monitor technology developments, review and adjust incentives, \nmanage funding requirements, and execute pilot projects. The authority will report to the Prime \nMinister\u2019s Council on Climate Change on the status of its program. \n \n17.  The  broad  contours  of  the  autonomous  and  enabled  authority  would  comprise  the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  A steering group, chaired by the minister for new and renewable energy and \ncomposed of representatives from all relevant ministries and other stakeholders, \nwill be set up to oversee the overall implementation of the NSM. ", "Appendix 2      25 \n(ii)  An executive committee, chaired by the secretary of the Ministry of New and \nRenewable Energy, will periodically review the progress of implementation of the \nprojects approved by the Mission Steering Group. \n(iii)  An  empowered  Solar  Research  Council  headed  by  an  eminent  scientist  will \nadvise the mission on all research and development, technology, and capacity \nbuilding related matters. \n(iv)  A  director,  with  the  rank  of  an  additional  secretary,  will  head  the  authority \nsecretariat and be responsible for day-to-day functioning as well as achieving the \ngoals laid out in a time-bound manner. \n ", "26    Appendix 3 \n \nPIPELINE OF SOLAR POWER GENERATION PROJECTS \n  Size of \nProject  Project Site \nName of Project Company  (MW)  Project Type   Location \nAatash Power Private Limited  5  Photovoltaic  Gujarat \nAbellon Clean Energy Limited  3  Photovoltaic  Gujarat \nAES Solar Energy Private Limited   5  Photovoltaic  Rajasthan \nAES Solar Energy Private Limited (US)  15  Photovoltaic  Gujarat \nAlex Astral Power Private Limited  25  Photovoltaic  Gujarat \nAlex Solar Private Limited  5  Photovoltaic  Orissa \nAlex Spectrum Radiation Private Limited  5  Photovoltaic  Rajasthan \nAlpha Green   1  Photovoltaic  Gujarat \nAmbit Advisory Services Private Limited  5  Photovoltaic  Gujarat \nAmrit Animation Private Limited   5  Photovoltaic  Rajasthan \nAPCA Power   5  Photovoltaic  Gujarat \nAravali Infrapower Limited   5  Photovoltaic  Gujarat \nAsahi Energy Pvt.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe India country partnership strategy, 2009\u20132012 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will continue to emphasize \ninfrastructure development (e.g., transport, energy, urban, and water resource management). ADB\u2019s energy program \nin India aims to enhance the impact of the government\u2019s initiatives for demand- and supply-related programs. The \nplanned activities include (i) developing renewable and alternative energy sources, and clean generation technology; \n(ii) reducing technical and commercial losses in transmission and distribution networks and facilities; (iii) strengthening \ninterregional  transmission  capacity;  (iv)  bringing  demand-side  management  and  energy  conservation  into  the \nmainstream; and (v) promoting private sector participation, while ensuring environmental sustainability, and supporting \ninstitutional strengthening to implement the reforms required by the Electricity Act, 2003. The project is also directly \naligned with ADB\u2019s Asia Solar Energy Initiative (ASEI) to (i) facilitate knowledge sharing and transfer for solar power; \n(ii) help develop, finance, and commission 3,000 megawatts (MW) of solar power generation capacity in developing \nmember countries (DMCs)by March 2013; and (iii) pilot test innovative financing mechanisms and risk mitigation \nmeasures specifically for solar power. The ASEI seeks to stimulate solar power development in DMCs in Asia with the \ngoal of (i) increasing economies of scale to reduce costs and improve solar energy\u2019s competitiveness within the grid; \n(ii) exploit select DMCs\u2019 solar radiation resources, service their fast growing electricity demand, and utilize their greater \navailability of land compared with most developed countries; and, (iii) promote DMCs\u2019 potential to become global and \nregional manufacturing hubs for solar technology goods and equipment. \n \nThe guarantee facility will mobilize commercial financing to an estimated 150 MW of solar power, which will help \ndiversify the country\u2019s energy mix. The facility will provide credit guarantees in favor of commercial banks that will \nextend credit to multiple special purpose companies that intend to develop small-scale solar power generation \nprojects. The projects will increase the reliability and availability of electricity in areas where it is located. This will \nincrease economic growth through increased commercial and/or enterprise activities, and more opportunities can be \ntapped from this development at state, local, and community level. \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nKey issues. The projects that will be covered under the guarantee facility will indirectly contribute to poverty reduction. \nThe projects will contribute to the country\u2019s poverty reduction effort on three main fronts: (i) the operation of the \nprojects will add needed electricity to the grid for use by the state population and promote economic activities; as the \nprojects operate, they contribute to the state tax system, where tax revenue can be streamed to promote poverty \nreduction activities; (ii) the projects will tap a renewable energy source, thereby displacing potential reliance on \nimported fuel sources and will create outright savings and foreign exchange savings that could be utilized for other \nproductive purposes; and (iii) during its construction, operation, and maintenance phases, the project will provide job \nopportunities to local communities and promote economic activities in the vicinity.  \nDesign\u00a0features.\u00a0The guarantee facility will provide credit guarantees in favor of commercial banks that will extend credit \nto independent power producer borrowers that intend to develop small-scale solar power generation projects. Projects \nwill include solar power generation facilities in India with an installed capacity of not less than 2 MW and not more than \n25 MW that are connected to the relevant state electricity grid. Projects that will be guaranteed by the facility will have \na direct and material impact to poverty reduction efforts. \n ", "30    Appendix 4 \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nLand acquisition and involuntary resettlement. Most solar projects are being sited on barren or unproductive \ngovernment land in a coordinated effort by state governments. A 5 MW solar power plant will require about \n12 hectares of land. No physical displacement is expected since lands can be flexibly acquired to avoid impacts on \nexisting villages and communities. Partner banks extending credit to special purpose vehicles (SPVs) for developing \nsolar power projects will be assisted in establishing their own environmental and social management systems \n(ESMSs) to ensure that projects are screened for involuntary resettlement impacts and relevant plans are prepared in \naccordance with national laws and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). For some projects where land has been \nacquired through expropriation or purchased through negotiations, the ESMS for each commercial bank or lender will \nrequire a social compliance audit, including on-site assessment, to (i) identify past or present concerns related to \nimpacts  on  the  involuntary  resettlement,  and  tribal  communities  that  may  be  considered  indigenous  peoples; \n(ii) determine whether actions were in accordance with ADB\u2019s safeguard principles and requirements and to identify \nand plan measures to address outstanding compliance issues.  \n \nImpact on indigenous peoples and/or scheduled tribes. Potential impacts to indigenous peoples and/or scheduled \ntribes can only be ascertained once specific sites for projects are located. All mitigating measures that will address \ndirect and indirect impacts on indigenous peoples/scheduled tribes will be addressed following the ESMS.  \n \nLabor, gender, and other social issues. No significant issues pertaining to labor, gender, and other social issues are \nexpected. The construction phase of projects is relatively short compared with other power generation infrastructure. \nInflux of population as a result of the project is unlikely. Social dimensions of each solar power project will be analyzed \nas part of the environmental and social assessment to be undertaken by each SPV in accordance with the Safeguard \nPolicy Statement and agreed ESMS. The ESMS of each partner bank will contain requirements for SPVs to include \ncompliance with core labor standards in the bidding documents for civil works contracts. \n \nEach partner bank will establish an ESMS following the ESMS arrangements and the Safeguard Policy Statement. \nThe ESMS satisfactory to ADB shall be adopted and established by each partner bank prior to ADB issuing a \nguarantee for the first project.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation (C&P) process during project preparation. \nConsultations  were  conducted  with  other  international  financial  institutions  and  other  international  and  local \ncommercial banks that may be interested in becoming a partner bank. During project design, the levels of participation \nwill mainly include information sharing and consultation, and the requirements to undertake such activities will be \ndetailed in the ESMS. If social safeguard plans are required for a project, another meaningful consultation will be \nundertaken to ensure that the contents of such plans, including grievance redress mechanism, are understood by the \naffected persons or communities. State mandated public hearings for projects may be initiated by state agencies. It is \nalso envisaged that stakeholders\u2019 engagement will be ongoing during the entire life of a project, which may become \npart of a project company\u2019s corporate social responsibility program. \n \n2.  What level of C&P is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n     Information sharing    Consultation     Collaborative decision making     Empowerment \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared for project implementation?   Yes   No  \nDetails of the projects\u2019 consultation and participation activities will be detailed in the environmental assessment reports \nthat will be prepared.  \nC.  Gender and Development         Gender Mainstreaming Category: Some gender benefits \n1.  Key issues. Solar power projects have the potential to engage or employ local women on tasks such as \ninstallation of solar panels, operation, and maintenance. In general terms, the positive economic impact of the new \nenergy source will have a ripple effect on women who run small and medium-sized enterprises. \n2.   Key actions.

Introduction \n1.  This section includes an overall description of the guarantee facility and the nature of \nbusiness  operations  or  business  activities  of  its  existing  and  likely  future  portfolio.  It  also \ndiscusses the nature of the projects that may be financed by the partner banks using Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s funds.1 \n \nB.  Environmental and Social Management Policy and Applicable Requirements \n1.  Policy \n \n2.  The  environmental  and  social  management  policy  of  [name  of  partner  bank]  was \napproved by the Board of Directors (or signed by ........... [the President], or indicate other \nposition/designation) on \u2026\u2026\u2026. [date/month/year] and states that: \n \n3.  The objectives of the environmental and social management system are: \n(i)  To avoid, and when avoidance is not possible, to minimize and mitigate adverse \nimpacts of projects on the environment and affected people; and \n(ii)  To maximize opportunities for environmental and social benefits. \n \n4.  [Name  of  partner  bank]  continually  endeavors  to  ensure  and  enhance  effective \nenvironmental and social management practices in all its activities, products, and services with \na special focus on the following: \n(i)  Ensuring that applicable environmental and social safeguard requirements, as \ndefined below are met for all projects;2  \n(ii)  Financing projects only when they are expected to be designed, constructed, \noperated, and maintained in a manner consistent with applicable environmental \nand social safeguard requirements, as defined below;  \n(iii)  Integrating  environmental  and  social  risk  into  its  internal  risk  management \nanalysis; \n(iv)  Ensuring  appropriate  consultation  and  transparency  in  its  project  company\u2019s \nactivities; \n(v)  Working  together  with  project  companies  to  put  into  practice  applicable \nenvironmental and social safeguard requirements; and \n(vi)  Promoting projects with environmental and social benefits. \n \n5.  This policy will be communicated to all staff and operational employees of the company. \n \n2.  Applicable Environmental and Social Safeguard Requirements \n \n6.  [Name of partner bank] will ensure that:   \n(i)  All projects using ADB funds are screened against the prohibited investment \nactivities list of the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009); \n                                                 \n1  This is a template which will be modified with each partner bank under the facility. \n2  The term \u201cprojects\u201d is used in this document to mean business activities financed in part and in full by [name of \nbank/lender] using ADB funds.  \n ", "Appendix 5      33 \n \n(ii)  All projects using ADB funds with potential significant environmental and/or social \nimpacts are reviewed and evaluated against safeguard requirements 1\u20133 of the \nADB Safeguard Policy Statement; and \n(iii)  All projects are reviewed and evaluated against the national laws, regulations, \nand standards on environment, health, safety, involuntary resettlement and land \nacquisition, indigenous peoples, and physical cultural resources. \n \nC.  Environmental and Social Management Procedures \n1.  Screening and Categorization \n7.  At  an  initial  stage  of  identifying  a  project,  the  environmental  and  social  safeguard \nmanager3 (or other designated staff) of the partner bank will apply ADB\u2019s prohibited investment \nactivities list. If the project involves a prohibited activity, the special purpose vehicle company \n(SPV) will be informed that the project will not be considered. Otherwise, the environmental and \nsocial safeguard manager (or other designated staff) will indicate the applicable environmental \nand social safeguard requirements for the project. \n \n8.  At the project identification stage, the environmental and social safeguard manager (or \nother designated officer) will work with the SPV4 to make a rapid assessment of the likely \nenvironmental and involuntary resettlement impacts and effects on indigenous peoples. The \nenvironmental assessment checklist and social safeguard screening checklist are designed to \nguide the deal team of the partner bank in the rapid assessment of impacts. The checklists are \nused to determine the significance of potential environmental and/or social impacts associated \nwith the project.  \n \n9.  Once the checklists and the verification work are completed by the deal team of [name \nof partner bank], the project will be classified as one of the following categories: category A (with \npotential  significant  environmental  and/or  social  impacts),  category  B  (with  less  significant \nenvironmental and/or social impacts), or category C (with minimal or no impacts).  \n \n10.
