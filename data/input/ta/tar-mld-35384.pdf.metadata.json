The Government of the Maldives (the Government) requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to provide a technical assistance (TA) grant for debt management.1  The request \nwas in congruence with the Government\u2019s efforts to integrate the analysis of debt sustainability \ninto medium- and long-term macroeconomic planning and to promote good governance. The TA \nconcept  paper  was  included  in  ADB's  country  strategy  and  program  2003\u20132005  for  the \nMaldives.  \n \n2.  The Fact-Finding Mission (the Mission)2 visited the (Maldives) during 9-13 March 2003. \nThe Mission met with representatives from the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT), \nMaldives  Monetary  Authority  (MMA),  Ministry  of  Planning  and  National  Development,  and \nDepartment of External Resources, the primary administrators of domestic and foreign debt in \nthe Maldives. The Government and the Mission reached an understanding on the objectives, \nscope, financing plan, and implementation details of the TA. The TA framework is provided in \nAppendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  During  the  last  decade,  exogenous  shocks3 have  threatened  Maldives'  traditional \nrevenue sources (fisheries and tourism). Supported by external and domestic borrowing, the \nMaldives' economy maintained a relatively steady pace of growth.  However, the country's \npublic debt portfolio expanded visibly.  \n \n4.  The amount and composition of the country's external debt portfolio is expected to \nchange, including more loan products priced at market rates rather than at concessional terms. \nThe  Maldives  has  enjoyed  preferential  lending  terms  on  external  assistance  and  loans  it \nreceived, given its status as a small island developing state and a less developed country \n(LDC). This effectively kept the debt service and thus the associated budgetary pressures to a \nminimum. However, after the April 2003 triennial review of the United Nations Committee for \nDevelopment Policy (CDP), the Maldives was recommended for graduation from LDC status. \nThe United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) reviewed this recommendation in \nits July 2003 session; a final decision was not taken on the issue. The Maldives' possible \ngraduation will be considered further during CDP's resumed session in October 2003.  \n \n5.  During the July session of CDP, it was noted that Maldives met two out of three criteria \nfor graduation in the last three reviews of its LDC status; hence, it qualified technically for \ngraduation. Thus, the Maldives could be graduated from LDC status by the end of 2003. \nGraduation  would  have  a  direct  impact  on  the  debt  burden  of  the  country,  as  the  grant-\ndominated assistance blend offered to the Maldives thus far would shift toward a higher-cost \nloan portfolio. In view of the economic fragility of this small island country, CDP members may \nopt  for  a  graduation  process  extending  over  the  next  3\u20136  years,  rather  than  immediate \nsecession.  Regardless  of  the  timetable,  impending  graduation  underscores  the  need  for \nimmediate adoption of comprehensive debt monitoring and management, anchored by sound \nfinancial and macroeconomic analyses for long-term economic sustainability of the country. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 13 March 2003. \n2  The Mission comprised Yesim Elhan, economist, South Asia Governance, Finance and Trade Division.  \n3  Global warming changed the ecological balance of the atolls and surrounding seas, affecting fisheries and the \ntourism sector, while health and political safety concerns because of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) \nand the 11 September 2001 events had an impact on the number of tourists traveling to the country. ", "2  \n6.  The Government has already taken steps to develop institutional and staff capacity for \nmanaging  its  debt  portfolio.  As  early  as  1986,  assistance  for  administering  the  country's \nexpanding  external  debt  was  solicited  from  the  Technical  Assistance  Group  of  the \nCommonwealth Secretariat. In March 1987, CD-DRMS (Version 4), a software package for debt \nmonitoring developed by the Commonwealth Secretariat, was installed in MMA and several staff \nmembers were trained on data collection and the use of this software. A computerized debt \ndatabase was developed by the end of 1987, and this model was used until 1991. But as the \ndebt portfolio grew, an upgrade of the spreadsheet-based system to a more sophisticated \ndatabase was needed. MMA requested assistance from various aid agencies for procuring \nadditional  hardware  and  software  and  for  human  resource  development.  MMA  received \nhardware and upgraded software (CD-DRMS, Version 5.4) from the Commonwealth Fund for \nTechnical Cooperation in 1995, and staff members in MMA and MOFT4 were trained to use the \nnew software at that time. This debt monitoring system is still in use.  \n \n7.  Currently, the Financial Institutions and External Debt Management Section (FIEDMS) of \nMOFT manages the external debt portfolio, while the public finance and treasury sections \nmonitor  the  domestic  debt  portfolio.  The  Commonwealth  Secretariat  has  provided  debt \nmanagement  software  and  training  on  how  to  use  the  software  intermittently,  since  1986. \nPeriodically, additional staff members from MOFT and Department of External Resources were \ntrained to support the debt management unit. However, due to staff turnover, only one of the \noriginal trainees is still involved in debt management. And due to capacity constraints, the bulk \nof  debt  management  is  limited  to  descriptive  analysis  of  raw  data  compiled  as  Excel \nspreadsheets.  \n \n8.  Current staff cannot carry out the major aspects of debt management, i.e., formulation of \na debt and borrowing strategy, implementation of the strategy, management of the existing debt \nportfolio, and provision of guidance on new borrowing based on repayment capabilities. Hence, \nFIEDMS  needs  to  develop  its  current  debt  recording  function  of  debt  monitoring  and \nmanagement facility, to be able to monitor all categories of domestic and foreign debt, and \nanalyze existing debt stock with respect to the currency composition, maturity profile, and \ninterest rate structure. Only after FIEDMS's capabilities are enhanced can cost and risk be \nminimized, guidelines on the appropriate level and terms of new borrowings be defined, and \ntimely debt-service repayment ensured.  \n \n9.  The Government acknowledges the importance of staffing the debt management unit \nwithin MOFT with technically capable employees that can be trained and retained in that post in \nthe long run. A human resources gap study was conducted in the MOFT in July 2002.5 Guided \nby the recommendations of this study and internal staffing policy, MOFT designated three staff \nmembers who will be trained on the new debt management software and methodology under \nthe current TA and will continue to work for the debt management unit in the long term. A fourth \nstaff member will be joining FIEDMS by mid-2004, upon completing her post graduate work. \nEfforts to fortify the debt management function of MOFT will be more potent if anchored by a \ndebt management policy. Hence, as part of ADB's loan for strengthening the Maldives' public \naccounting system,6 a broader policy framework is being developed that clearly defines the core \nfunctions of the Government and the roles and capabilities of key MOFT staff, including those in \nFIEDMS. The loan will concretize the core functions of the Government with respect to public \n                                                 \n4 In the interim, some of the debt management functions had been delegated from MMA to MOFT. \n5 The study was supported by TA 3824 (ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to Maldives for Strengthening of the Public \nAccounting System. Manila). \n6 ADB.2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of the Maldives for the Strengthening of the Public Accounting System Project. Manila. (Loan 1915-MLD). ", "  3\naccounting, auditing, budgeting, and debt management, and assess the extent and efficiency \nwith which these functions are carried out by MOFT staff, which will assist the Maldives to \ndevelop a fast-track capacity building initiative. The initiative will include on-the-job and external \ntraining for staff, support from long-term consultants, and outsourcing of certain positions as and \nwhen needed within the context of MOFT human resource policy. As part of the loan, the role of \nMOFT in accounting, auditing, and fund flow management is expanding and its accountability as \na  service  provider  to  line  ministries  is  being  more  clearly  defined.  Within  this  context,  an \neffective  management  of  data  on  internal  and  external  public  debt  is  crucial.  This  will \nnecessitate compilation and processing of all debt-related data to form a reliable and complete \nresource for internal and external reporting on debt and related issues. The current TA will \naddress that need and develop a debt management system in accord with the macroeconomic \nobjectives and framework of the country. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  Given the growing debt portfolio and its changing composition as reflected in the shift to \nless concessional funds, public debt management needs to be strengthened in the Maldives. \nThe TA's debt management capacity building will focus on (i) designing and implementing a \ncomplete  and  consolidated  database  on  all  public  debt,  and  (ii)  training  staff  in  debt \nmanagement  units  to  ensure  their  proficient  use  of  debt  management  and  sustainability \nsoftware. The aim is to facilitate sound management of the existing debt portfolio, and provide \ninput  on  new  borrowings  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  country's  repayment  capacity  and  development \nframework. The ultimate goal will be to develop debt analysis into a comprehensive, forward-\nlooking debt strategy, with a focus on long-term macroeconomic sustainability. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  Under this TA (i) the legal framework, institutional structure, and current practices for \ndebt  management  will  be  reviewed;  (ii)  a  time-bound  action  plan  will  be  developed  and \nimplemented for strengthening the current system; (iii) necessary equipment and software for \nefficient debt management will be provided to MOFT; and (iv) provision of equipment and \nsoftware will be supported by training given to MOFT, MMA, and other government offices \nworking on debt management related activities. The training will include means of interfacing \nbetween the existing and new systems, fully using all features of the new software while \npreparing various descriptive and background reports for internal and external use,7 and basic \ntrouble-shooting  to  maintain  the  newly-created  debt  management  database  during  daily \noperations.        \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $412,000 equivalent, comprising $350,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $62,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will finance the \nentire foreign exchange component on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program, while the \n                                                 \n7  FIEDMS prepares background reports periodically for the MOFT Economic Affairs and Policy Planning Section, to \nsupport their medium- and long-term macroeconomic planning, as well as descriptive reports for international \nfinancial institutions. ", "4  \nGovernment will finance the local currency cost equivalent of $62,000. Detailed cost estimates \nand financing plan are provided in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  MOFT will be the Executing Agency for this TA. FIEDMS of MOFT will be responsible for \noverall implementation of the TA. Two counterpart staff to be nominated from FIEDMS will work \nclosely with the two TA consultants, to facilitate rapid and complete information transfer in the \ncourse of TA implementation. FIEDMS will also coordinate information sharing and (as needed) \njoint training activities under this TA among MOFT's relevant sections (i.e., FIEDMS' Public \nFinance Section and Treasury Section), MMA, Ministry of Planning and National Development, \nand Department of External Resources. \n \n14.  Two international consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants, to provide the required consulting services for a total of \n10 person-months. The consultant team will comprise a public debt management specialist (6 \nperson-months) and a debt management software specialist (4 person-months). Outline terms \nof  reference  for  consultants  are  provided  in  Appendix  3.  Equipment,  including  computer \nhardware and software, will be procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. \nAfter the completion of the TA, all equipment purchased under the TA will be handed over to the \nGovernment. \n \n15.     The TA will be implemented during 10 months, starting in November 2003 and ending \nin September 2004. The consultants will prepare (i) an inception report within 15 days of their \nfielding; (ii) a needs-based assessment report on the current institutional structure and practice \nof debt management, within a month of consultant fielding; (iii) a midterm review after the third \nmonth of consultancy; and (iv) a draft final report for the TA, submitted 3 weeks before the end \nof the consulting term. The needs-based assessment report will include a comparative appraisal \nof available debt management software, identifying computer hardware and software that will \nbest address the needs of the Maldives. The recommendations of this report and the inception \nreport will be discussed at a tripartite meeting attended by the TA consultants, representatives \nfrom MOFT and FIEDMS, and ADB staff overseeing TA implementation. All reports will be \nsubmitted (in hard and soft copies) to MOFT and ADB for review and comments. Comments \nreceived from MOFT and ADB will be duly incorporated before the consultants finalize the \nreports. The recommendations of the final report will be discussed during a tripartite meeting. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Maldives for Strengthening of Debt Management, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.
