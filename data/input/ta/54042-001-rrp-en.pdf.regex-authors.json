THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $75,000,000 in OrbiMed Asia Partners IV, L.P. \n \n2.  OrbiMed Asia Partners IV, L.P. (OAP IV) is a private equity fund established as a Cayman \nIslands exempted limited partnership with an expected fund size of $650 million. OrbiMed Asia \nGeneral Partner IV, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership, is the general partner \nof OAP IV. The adviser of the general partner and the fund manager, OrbiMed Advisors LLC \n(OrbiMed), is a limited liability company incorporated in Delaware, United States (US).1 OrbiMed \nwas established in 1989 and is one of the world\u2019s largest health care-dedicated investors with \nabout $14 billion in assets under management as of 31 March 2020.2 This is a second follow-on \nequity investment by ADB into a health care fund managed by OrbiMed.3 \n \n3.  OAP IV is expected to provide mainly growth capital to health care companies operating \nin India and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) across the biopharma, medical technology, \nhealth care services, diagnostics, and distribution subsectors. Since OAP IV is a health care \nfocused  fund,  no  climate  change  impact  is  expected  from  this  investment.  The  ongoing \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is driving the need for higher health care capacity \nreserves and stimulating direct demand for health care services and products, as well as hard \nand soft health infrastructure across the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADBs) developing member \ncountries. In this context, ADB\u2019s proposed investment in OAP IV is expected to be highly catalytic \nin  developing  effective  long  term  solutions  and  responses  to  global  health  care  crises  by \nenhancing disease detection and treatment and response capacities in India and the PRC. \n \n4.  Even though OAP IV is a health care focused fund, the proposed investment is not \ncategorized as a COVID-19 response project because OrbiMed did not specifically design the \nfund to address COVID-19 related issues. Instead, the fund has a broader and longer-term focus \ngiven its aim of seeking equity investments in established and growing companies across the \nhealth care segment in India and PRC.  \n  \n5.  OAP IV, however, could potentially end up supporting companies involved in COVID-19 \nresponses given OrbiMed\u2019s global expertise and focus on health care. The blind pool nature of \nprivate equity funds further means that investors in the fund (including ADB) do not know the \ncomposition of the OAP IV\u2019s portfolio at the time of our investment. Therefore, it is not possible to \nestimate the COVID-19 impact of the fund\u2019s investments ex-ante.   \n \nII.  THE FUND \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n6.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n \n \n1  In this report, references to OrbiMed are to OrbiMed Advisors LLC. \n2  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)].. \n3  ADB\u2019s earlier investments in OrbiMed-managed funds include: (i) ADB. Regional: OrbiMed Asia Partners II, LP Fund \n(2013 vintage, $325 million) - $60 million commitment approved in November 2013; and (ii) ADB. Regional: OrbiMed \nAsia Partners III, LP Fund (2017 vintage, $551 million) - $59.9 million commitment approved in August 2017. ", "2 \n7.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n8.  Investment identification. The investment in OAP IV is a continuation of ADB\u2019s efforts to \nincrease nonsovereign financing support to the critical health care sector and an endorsement of \nOrbiMed as a strong health care partner for ADB in the Asia and Pacific region. OrbiMed is unique \nbecause it is the first Asian regional dedicated health care fund manager with expertise across \nthe entire health care spectrum.

[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n17.  Advisory committee. In addition to the investment committee, OAP IV will have an \nadvisory committee of up to seven members representing OAP IV\u2019s limited partners to be \nappointed by the general partner. ADB is expected to be represented on OAP IV\u2019s advisory \ncommittee, which will opine on matters related to potential conflicts of interest, exercise its right \nto  consent  to  certain  matters  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  limited  partnership \nagreement, and act in an advisory role to the general partner and its advisor. \n \nD.  Financial Performance \n \n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access \nto Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n ", "3 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n18.  ADB intends to make an equity investment of up to $75 million in OAP IV, representing \n11.5% of the expected fund size. ADB\u2019s investment will not exceed 25% of OAP IV\u2019s total \ncommitted capital and will not result in ADB being the single largest investor in OAP IV. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis of Expected Returns and Assumptions \n \n19.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n21.  Reporting arrangements. The general partner will be required to provide ADB with \nunaudited quarterly reports, audited annual reports with financial statements, a fund overview, \nannual development effectiveness monitoring reports, and an overview of the portfolio with \nsummary information on each portfolio company\u2019s performance. ADB will review this information \nand follow up with the general partner if more information or clarification is needed. If the information \nreceived from the general partner raises issues that could impair the value of ADB\u2019s investment in \nOAP IV, ADB could decide to put OAP IV on a watch list for more frequent and detailed review. \n \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n22.  Catalytic anchor role. OrbiMed continues to demonstrate to institutional investors that a \ndedicated  health  care  private  equity  fund  is  an  investable  asset  in  Asia.  ADB's  ongoing \nparticipation in the Asia platform provides new investors with the necessary comfort and validation \nof the strategy, team and health care market opportunities in Asia. [This information has been \nremoved as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. \n17.2.(v)]. As one of the major anchor investors, ADB\u2019s continued support of OrbiMed provides the \nearly validation needed to secure commitments from such new institutions, thereby enabling \nOrbiMed to successfully raise its largest targeted Asia fund since inception in 2008. \n \n23.  Increased  gender  inclusiveness. OrbiMed  has  committed  to  working  with  ADB  to \nexplore and adopt measures to achieve a more gender equitable work force at OAP IV. As a \nresult, ADB aims to secure a gender categorization for the investment of some gender elements. \n \n24.  Environmental, social, and governance standards. ADB's participation will obligate \nOrbiMed to ensure that OAP IV's investee companies comply with ADB's environment and social \nsafeguard standards, and to report on development indicators. ADB's role, along with other \nmembers of OAP IV's advisory committee, will also be to assist in providing oversight on important \ngovernance matters, which are critical for investee companies to demonstrate as they seek \nadditional sources of growth capital from institutional and/or individual investors. \n \nE.

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n34.  Impact. The project is aligned with the following impact: funding increased to enhance \ncapacity and resilience of health care systems to fight and control pandemic outbreaks in Asia, \nparticularly in India and the PRC. \n \n35.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: financial and social sustainability \nof  private  equity  investments  in  innovative  health  care  companies  demonstrated,  such  as \ncompanies producing or distributing essential medicines or vaccines, introducing innovative \nmedicines, medical devices or diagnostics, or providing health care services targeting lower-\nincome segments or rural or peri-urban markets, while also generating additional employment. \n \n36.  Outputs. The outputs of the project are (i) OAP IV established and (ii) gender equality of \nOAP IV\u2019s operations increased. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n37.  Consistency with ADB strategy. The investment in OAP IV aligns with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030  operational  priority  1,  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  which \nmandates ADB to undertake efforts to contribute to the overarching goal of universal health \ncoverage and to generate quality jobs to support inclusive growth for all. This engagement also \n ", "5 \naccelerates progress in gender equality and contributes to operational priority 2, accelerating \nprogress in gender equality. \n \n38.  Consistency with country strategies. The investment is consistent with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for India, 2018\u20132022 and country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u2013\n2020, which include support for the countries\u2019 health sectors as strategic priorities.4 \n \n \n39.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The investment in \nOAP IV is consistent with ADB\u2019s operational plan for health, which strongly supports private sector \napproaches to improve quality, affordability, and accessibility in the health sector.5 \n \n40.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n41.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009).6 \n \n42.  Category FI. ADB has assessed the investment's potential environmental and social \nimpacts, its risks associated with OrbiMed\u2019s existing and likely OAP IV future portfolio, and its \ncommitment and capacity for environmental and social management. During due diligence, ADB \nhas identified the following actions to enhance the environmental and social management system \n(ESMS): improve the pre-capital call process for investment screening notification to ADB, \ndevelop subsector-specific environmental risk and regulatory compliance screening checklists, \nimplement a training plan based on identified needs of the OAP IV investment team, and refine \nannual  environmental  and  social  performance  reporting.  OrbiMed  has  agreed  to  required \nenhancements to the ESMS and such will be applied prior to first capital call for an investment. \nOrbiMed will (i) apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list, (ii) ensure that investments using \nADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and abide by applicable national laws \nand regulations, and (iii) establish and maintain an appropriate ESMS satisfactory to ADB before \ndisbursement.7 The ESMS will set out requirements, as applicable, for compliance with national \nlabor laws and measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor standards, \npursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy. ADB will retain the right to opt out of contributing \ncapital to any investment categorized as A, and any investment categorized as B for involuntary \nresettlement or indigenous peoples impacts. The ESMS will also contain requirements, as \napplicable, for information disclosure and consultation with affected people in accordance with \nADB requirements. OrbiMed will include in its annual reporting information to ADB (i) the nature \nof subprojects and categorization, (ii) compliance with the safeguard and social requirements, \nand (iii) compliance with applicable national and international laws and standards. \n \n \n4  ADB. 2017.

Some  gender  elements.  Women  are  significantly  underrepresented  among  the \ninvestment decision-makers at private equity and venture capital firms in Asia where women make \nup only 18% of employees on average and hold just 12% of senior roles.8 OrbiMed\u2019s Asia platform \nis a notable exception with 35% of its 17 staff, and 20% of its senior positions held by women.9 \nOrbiMed has a policy on preventing sexual harassment that applies globally. Following ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Gender and Development (1998), OAP IV has incorporated measures to promote \ngender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. Key features of the gender actions are (i) promoting \nat least one female staff member to vice-president or senior associate; (ii) starting a mentorship \nprogram in OrbiMed\u2019s Asia offices that includes at least 50% of female investment professionals; \nand (iii) recruiting a female lead in India for environmental, social, and governance issues. OAP \nIV will submit periodic reports on its implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n44.  OAP IV was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n45.  The proposed equity investment is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and \nsingle exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n46.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),10 \nADB will proceed with the assistance upon establishing that the governments of ADB member \ncountries where OAP IV will invest using ADB finance have no objection to the proposed \nassistance to OAP IV. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance \nsatisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n47.  I am satisfied that the proposed equity investment would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nequity investment of up to $75,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources in OrbiMed Asia \nPartners IV, L.P., with such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n \n2 October 2020 \n \n8  Preqin Ltd. 2019.
