INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the establishment of \nthe Platform for Climate Resilient and Low Carbon Urban Development through research and \ndevelopment at the Asian Development Bank (ADB) headquarters and in selected partner cities \nin ADB developing member countries (DMCs). The platform will be administered from Manila and \nallow ADB and key DMC stakeholders to share knowledge related to climate-informed urban \ndevelopment. \n \n2.  The TA will support the urban development-related priorities of ADB\u2019s Climate Change \nOperational Framework, 2017\u20132030 (CCOF2030).1 The TA will support selected ADB DMCs to \ndevelop  nationally  determined  contributions  (NDCs).2  The  TA  will  also  facilitate  city-level \ninvestments in climate-resilient, low-carbon projects.3 \n \n3.  The  TA  supports  the  priorities  articulated  in  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,  particularly  the \noperational priority on tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and \nenhancing environmental sustainability; the operational priority of making cities more livable, and \nthe operational priority on fostering regional cooperation and integration.4 The TA also supports \nthe use of high-level technology in projects.5 Climate-resilient and low-carbon urban development \nis also an integral part of ADB\u2019s drive under Strategy 2030 to make cities more livable. The TA is \nincluded in the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department\u2019s 2019 results-based \nwork plan, supports the ADB Urban Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020, and aligns with the ADB \nOperational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2016\u20132020.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Cities are home to more than 50% of the global population and consume more than two-\nthirds of the world\u2019s energy, which accounts for 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions.7 With \n90% of the world\u2019s urban areas situated on coastlines, cities are particularly vulnerable to climate \nchange impacts such as rising sea levels, severe heat waves, intensifying storms and floods, and \nprolonged droughts. These impacts cause loss of life, social disruption, and economic hardship \namong vulnerable urban populations. National urban policies must be bold in prioritizing climate-\nresilient, low-carbon development to mitigate these impacts. \n \n5.  To increase awareness and mobilize finance needed to bring these commitments to \ntraction,  policy  makers,  the  private  sector,  and  investors  must  work  together  to  prioritize \nsustainable urban development and investment models. This will require ambitious national \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n2  NDCs outline countries\u2019 commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and their climate adaptation priorities. \nAs of May 2019, 40 of 41 DMCs receiving ADB financing support have ratified the Paris Agreement on climate \nchange. The Kyrgyz Republic is the only ADB DMC that has not ratified the Paris Agreement. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 December 2018. \n4  ADB. 2018.

Washington, DC. \n \n ", "2 \nclimate actions, which should be reflected in the NDCs of DMCs.8 In their current form, NDCs \nreflect a lack of public financial resources, weak financial and institutional systems, and limited \nknowledge  and  awareness  to  support  effective  climate-resilient  and  low-carbon  urban \ndevelopment. Concrete guidelines are needed to help DMCs draft NDCs that will support the \ndevelopment of more sustainable, resilient, and livable cities.9 \n \n6.  The CCOF2030 calls for a \u201cSpotlight on Cities\u201d to develop analytical tools that will assist \nDMCs with (i) the collection of critical information on greenhouse gas emissions and data to \nsupport risk indexes, energy use, and projections for major cities (including city-based industries) \nacross the region; (ii) the establishment of a catalog of rapidly growing small- and medium-sized \ncities to promote green growth and climate-smart principles from the ground up, with a focus on \nvulnerable segments; and (iii) the development and implementation of a multisector model for \nsustainable urban development that strengthens climate resilience and supports a transition to a \nlow-carbon-emitting economy, while meeting urban infrastructure and urban service needs.10 \n \n7.  Making cities more resilient and livable is also a goal of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. Two \npriorities of the Strategy 2030 are aligned with the CCOF2030: (i) the focus on resilient cities, \nproviding strategic physical, social, and institutional infrastructure that enhances resilience to \nclimate change and disasters; and (ii) the priority on green cities with infrastructure that enables \nresource efficiency and healthy lifestyles. \n \n8.  Against this backdrop, the Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management Thematic \nGroup and the Urban Sector Group of ADB have developed a joint core rationale for the TA: (i) \ncentralized planning of NDCs does not capture climate risk-informed urban development; and (ii) \ncities do not prioritize climate-informed, multisector investments and, as a consequence, DMCs \nlack capacity to integrate climate-resilient, low-carbon urban development objectives in their \nNDCs. This TA project will address these disconnects by fostering low-carbon planning and \ndevising climate and disaster-risk-management assessments that result in a faster transition to \nclimate-resilient urban development planning in DMCs. \n \n9.  The TA is envisioned as a platform that will foster knowledge exchange among DMCs, \ndevelopment partners, and the private sector. The initiative will be operational from 2019 to \n2022.11  The  platform\u2019s  outputs  will  be  developed  in  cooperation  with  (i)  selected  DMC \ngovernments; (ii) selected city governments; (iii) ADB teams working on urban development \nacross operational departments; (iv) ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department; and (v) an \nextensive network of development partners, technical organizations, academia, the private sector, \n                                                \n8  Climate Action Tracker. The Climate Action Tracker estimates that the planned contribution of most NDCs is not in \nline with efforts to meet the Paris Agreement\u2019s long-term goal to limit global warming this century to 2\u00b0C while aiming \nto limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5\u00b0C. \n9  T.

City size measured by total population will vary by region, but the \nTA will not include the megalopolises of the People\u2019s Republic of China or India, nor will it exclude the smaller coastal \ncities of Pacific DMCs. Where relevant, the analysis will include climate-change-related cross-border risks for \nurban corridors. \n11 The CCOF2030 consists of two operational phases. Phase 1 (2017\u20132023) supports the scaling up of climate change \ninvestments in line with ADB\u2019s $6 billion climate financing commitment by 2020. Phase 2 (2024\u20132030) will position \nADB to further scale up its assistance taking account lessons learned in phase 1. ADB will harmonize phase 2 actions \nwith the second generation of NDCs and DMCs\u2019 increasingly ambitious climate actions. For this TA, funding is \nsecured until 2022. Additional financing will be sought to expand coverage. \n \n ", "3 \nand civil society organizations. ADB will initially establish the platform via the four outputs of this \nTA. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) cities\u2019 vulnerability to catastrophic climate \nevents reduced and (ii) cities\u2019 carbon emissions and air pollution levels decreased (footnote 1). \nThe TA will have the following outcome: DMCs\u2019 capacity to integrate climate-resilient, low-carbon \nurban development objectives in NDCs improved.12 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output  1:  ADB  practice  on  urban  climate  resilience  and  low-carbon  planning \ndocumented. A scoping exercise will be conducted over 6 months to consolidate findings from \nADB-wide TA and lending projects on urban development, climate change, and disaster risk \nmanagement. During the scoping period, two DMC cities under two distinct ADB operations \ndepartments will be selected. The selection criteria will include (i) the target city\u2019s readiness to \nundertake the foreseen TA activities, (ii) evidence of potential synergies with ongoing TA or \nlending projects in the target city, and (iii) eligibility of the target city under the Urban Climate \nChange Resilience Trust Fund (UCCRTF) under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility.13 \nAdditional funds will be sought later to expand the geographic scope of the TA and leverage the \nconcept beyond countries for which the UCCRTF can provide funding.14 A cross-sector and cross-\nthematic coordination structure will be established during scoping to enrich the platform with \nperspectives from different sectors and themes beyond urban development and climate change \nand disaster risk management. \n \n12.  Output 2: Knowledge of governance and institutional support for urban climate \nresilience  and  low-carbon  development  improved.  Improved  governance  and  public \nengagement are critical foundations of a shift toward climate-resilient urban development and \nsustainable infrastructure service delivery in cities. In the selected target cities, this output will \nidentify policy recommendations and financing plans to support actionable NDCs that can lead to \nlow-carbon and climate-resilient urban investments. Activities under this output will lead to the \nformulation of recommendations for national, regional, and city-level actions. Effective national \nurban  policy  actions  include  maximizing  public  fiscal  capacity  and  creating  incentives  for \nsustainable urban development; apportioning revenue collection and borrowing responsibilities \nand  allocating  revenue  across  different  jurisdictions  (including  city  governments);  and \nimplementing comprehensive, climate-smart national urban policies, including platforms and \npartnerships to finance the deficit in sustainable infrastructure in urban areas.15 \n \n13.  Output 3: Knowledge on access to finance, and climate resilience and low-carbon \nplanning improved. This output will (i) strengthen the capacity of local stakeholders in selected \ntarget cities to tap financing for strengthening climate resilience, (ii) develop integrated climate \n                                                \n12 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n13 Financing partners of the UCCRTF: the Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of Switzerland and the \nUnited Kingdom. \n14 A change in scope for the TA will be proposed when additional funding has been identified. The eligible counties to \nreceive support from the fund are Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, and \nViet Nam. \n15 ADB. 2013. Urban Operational Plan 2012\u20132020. Manila.  \n ", "4 \nrisk management approaches, and (iii) develop bottom-up models of low-carbon and/or climate \naction plans. In contrast to output 2, which covers national priorities, this output will recommend \nactions to be implemented at the city level. Public finance has traditionally been a significant \nsource of urban infrastructure investment, but public budgets are often insufficient for larger or \nmore complex projects, and the financing gap is most evident in cities in low- and middle-income \ncountries. Cities need support to develop pipelines of well-prepared and bankable investments to \nenhance  urban  resilience;  they  also  need  assistance  in  improving  access  for  private  and \ninstitutional investors and facilitating strategic investments to build resilience.16 Output 3 will \nexplore specific resilience-building investment prioritization methodologies to protect the urban \npoor and populations that are more vulnerable to climate change. The urban poor are highly \nexposed to shocks and stresses triggered by natural hazards and climate change, which result in \nloss of life, damage to assets, disruptions of livelihoods, and loss of income. These impacts extend \nto local governments, which suffer increased socioeconomic burden to provide post-disaster \nrelief. In the selected target cities, this output will explore methodologies to build investment road \nmaps for low-carbon urban development. \n \n14.  Output  4:  Knowledge  sharing  and  city  partnerships  enhanced.  This  output  will \nsupport the target cities to identify and address their knowledge gaps and requirements, in order \nto develop an information base for risk-informed decision-making. The output will assist cities in \nleveraging partnerships to build capacity for resilient and low-carbon urban development. Output \n4 will also develop best practice knowledge products to support climate change appraisal in urban \ninvestment projects. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nUCCRTF under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB. The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. Additional financing will be identified to expand TA \ncoverage beyond UCCRTF eligible countries. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will administer the TA and will be the executing agency. The Climate Change and \nDisaster Risk Management Division under the Sustainable Development and Climate Change \nDepartment will lead overall implementation and will coordinate closely with the Urban Sector \nGroup  and  relevant  ADB  operations  departments,  including  the  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment. Knowledge products developed under the TA will be disseminated through the ADB \nwebsite. The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n16 The output will address strategies to mobilize private finance for NDC implementation at the city level, particularly (i) \nmobilizing private sector finance in infrastructure, (ii) creating private financing options for adaptation measures, and \n(iii) climate proofing private investments and developing risk-management schemes. \n ", "5 \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative  June 2019\u2013December 2022 \nimplementation period \nExecuting and  SDCD will lead the implementation of the TA and will have the principal role in \nimplementing agency  the administration and supervision of the TA.
