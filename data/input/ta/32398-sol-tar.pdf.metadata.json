INTRODUCTION\n1. A key component of the Government of the Solomon Island\u2019s reform program\ninvolves  measures  to  improve  public  service  management  and  performance.1  The\nreforms were initiated in late 1997, with support from the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB) under the Public Sector Reform Program loan2 and Phase I of Strengthening of\nPublic  Sector  Management.3  The  ongoing  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  due  to  be\ncompleted by about mid-20004. To enable it to pursue the next stage of reforms in this\narea, the Government has requested additional ADB TA. Discussions on the design of\nthe  TA,  terms  of  reference  for  consultants,  cost  estimates,  and  implementation\narrangements were held during a mission from 6-11 December 1999.5 Although there\nhave been inadvertent delays in the implementation of the reforms (and in the release\nof the second tranche of the program loan), the current TA is justified at this time given\nthe need to maintain the momentum of the reform program and  capacity  building\nefforts. The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1. A summary of the Government\u2019s\nreform directions is found in Appendix 2.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. In the past two years, the Government has stabilized the economy, brought\nrecurrent expenditures under control, maintained fiscal discipline, eliminated arrears,\nrestructured public debt, reduced public expenditure by 8 percent, and introduced a\nprofessional and performance orientation in the public service.  Senior officers in the\npublic  service  are  being  placed  on  performance  contracts  with  measurable\nperformance  indicators.  All  Government  departments  are  being  asked  to  include\nverifiable performance targets as part of their budget submissions, and to report on the\naccomplishment of these targets.  Public service employment processes and laws are\nbeing rationalized and streamlined, with a view to ensuring transparency, merit-based\nselection, and equal opportunity. At the same time, structures and systems in key line\nministries  are  being  reviewed  and  reengineered  to  eliminate  waste  and  improve\nefficiency. Many of these innovations in the public service were introduced with the\nsupport of ADB\u2019s ongoing advisory TA due to close in 2000).  In general, the aims of\n                                               \n1 The Government\u2019s reform program covers policy actions in the areas of macroeconomic and fiscal\nmanagement, privatization, public sector management, and governance institutions. In general, the\nreform program remains on track and the Government has maintained its commitment.  However, the\ntimetable for specific reforms has been set back almost a year due to the outbreak in mid-1999 of ethnic\ntensions in Guadalcanal province, which resulted in the displacement and resettlement of a large part of\nthe local population and closure of major enterprises on the island. The ethnic difficulties have absorbed\na large part of the Government\u2019s resources, and temporarily diverted its attention away from the reform\nagenda.\n2  Loan 1627-SOL: Public Sector Reform Program Loan for US$25 million, approved on 27 August 1998).\n3  TA 3061-SOL: Strengthening Public Sector Management, for US$600,000, approved on 27 August\n1998.TA 3061-SOL: Strengthening Public Sector Management, for US$600,000, approved on 27 August\n1998.\n4  There may be a mistaken impression that inadequate or incomplete implementation of TA 3061 has\nmotivated the Phase II TA. The reality is that the Government has just recently embarked on a reform\nand capacity building process that is likely to require, perhaps, 10 or more years of institutional\nstrengthening in key areas of government.\n5  The TA was first listed in the ADB Business Opportunities on 17 December 1999.", "2\nthe ongoing TA are likely to be met; however, there is risk that some of the capacity\nbuilding efforts might have less impact if the Guadalcanal crisis continues to absorb\nGovernment attention (footnote 1) or if Government counterparts are shifted to other\npositions in the near future.\n3. The next stage of reforms involves continuing and consolidating these gains by\nbuilding sustainable capacities in the policy-making central agencies situated around\nthe Office of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Central agencies play a key role in\ndeveloping reforms and continuous improvement, assisting departments to implement\nreforms, and providing policy advice to the Prime Minister. The current TA focuses on\nstrengthening the Prime Minister\u2019s Office (Cabinet function) and the Public Service\nDepartment (PSD), including the Institutional Strengthening Unit (ISU) and the Institute\nfor Public Administration and Management6. The TA will focus on  enhancing  both\nmanagement and technical skills in these key units of the central agencies. At the same\ntime,  the  TA  will  facilitate  the  preparation  of  proposed  legislation  and  possible\nconstitutional amendments to support reforms in the public service.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objective\n4. The  ultimate  goal  of  the  TA  is  to  improve  Government  effectiveness  and\nresponsiveness. It can best attain this goal when the key policy- and decision-making\ninstitutions  \u2014  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office,  Cabinet,  and  PSD  \u2014  are  capable  and\nequipped to formulate, implement, and manage comprehensive Government reforms.\nAmong the desired outcomes from the TA are (i) the transformation of PSD into a\ncentral personnel agency, with responsibility for human resource policy, training and\ndevelopment, management improvement, consultancy, and management review for the\nwhole of the public service; (ii) a Cabinet Office under the Prime Minister\u2019s Office that is\nable to provide timely and appropriate policy advice; (iii) a capable Institute for Public\nAdministration and Management that is able to meet the training needs of the public\nservice; and (iv) an improved legislative framework that supports the Government\u2019s\nreform agenda and provides a basis for sustainable continuous improvement  over\nmany years.\n \nB. Scope\n5. The TA will provide the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, Cabinet, and PSD with ready\nsources of policy advice and capacity building to enable them to introduce the desired\nreforms  and  modifications  in  the  public  service  in  coming  years.  Under  the  TA,\ninternational and domestic consultants will be deployed intermittently7 over the next 18-\n                                               \n6  The Ministry of Finance is excluded from the focus of the TA as it is already being provided with\nsubstantial  support  under  ongoing  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  TA\nprojects focused on sound public expenditure management and on strengthening financial management\nand auditing capacity of the Government. ADB is closely coordinating with the Government and AusAID\nto ensure that the respective TA efforts are complementary.\n7  The use of international consultants on an intermittent basis is to avoid dependence by the Government\non  expatriate  assistance,  especially  for  line  functions,  and  to  maximize  local  ownership  of,  and\nresponsibility for, the reform process.  The larger than normal amount budgeted for international travel is\nin view of the frequency of visits of the international consultants.", "3\n24 months to provide the required advice and skills transfer. The TA will also finance\nproduction  of  materials,  minor  office  equipment,  and  seminars  and  workshops  to\nsupport  the  work  of  the  consultants.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  of  the  TA\nconsultants,  covering  the  areas  of  public  sector  management,  training  and\ndevelopment, human resources management and policy, legal drafting, and business\nprocess reengineering, are attached as Appendix 3.\n C. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n \n6. The total cost of the TA is estimated at US$650,000 equivalent, comprising a\nforeign  exchange  cost  of  US$480,000  and  a  local  currency  cost  of  US$170,000\nequivalent. The entire foreign exchange cost and US$70,000 of the local currency cost,\ntotaling US$550,000 equivalent will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the ADB-\nfunded  TA  Program.  The  Government  will  provide  the  remaining  US$100,000\nequivalent in kind through the provision of counterpart staff, office accommodation, and\nother support services.  Detailed cost estimates are presented in Appendix 4.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n \n7. PSD under the Office of the Prime Minister will be the Executing Agency of the\nTA. The TA will finance the services of international and domestic consultants, training,\nworkshops and seminars, travel of consultants and officials, and office equipment and\nmaterials. The TA will finance 17 person-months of international consulting services\nconsisting of (i) team leader and public sector management specialist, (ii) legal drafting\nexpert, (iii) human resources management specialist, (iv) training and development\nspecialist, and (v) quality and continuous improvement specialist.  The services of the\ninternational  consultants  will  be  rendered  on  an  intermittent  basis,  as  and  when\nrequired by PSD, to fit in with the requirements of the reform program.  The TA will also\nfinance up to 12 person-months of domestic consulting services in the fields of public\nadministration, human resources development, training, client satisfaction surveys, and\nmanagement improvement, to be used in a flexible manner8 to support the work of PSD\nand the international consultants.\n8. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements for the engagement of domestic\nconsultants.  The procurement of office equipment and materials under the TA will be\nthe responsibility of the team leader of the consultants.  All equipment and materials\nfinanced under the TA will be procured in accordance with arrangements satisfactory to\nADB.  No advance payment facility will be required to finance the workshops, seminars,\noffice  equipment,  and  materials.    Instead,  these  cost  items  will  be  included,  as\nappropriate, in the contracts of the international consultants who will be responsible for\nprocuring and liquidating the advances made to them for these items in accordance\nwith the ADB's standard contract for consulting services.  In most cases, workshops\nand seminars will be organized and facilitated by the consultants; the workshop venue\n                                               \n8  Two to three domestic consultants will each be engaged for about 100-200 person-days over one\ncalendar  year,  to  provide  support  on  an  intermittent  basis  to  the  Executing  Agency  and  to  the\ninternational  consultants.  It  is  envisioned  that  the  domestic  consultants  will  work,  in  part,  as\nunderstudies to the international consultants, to provide continuity during periods when the international\nconsultant is not deployed.  This arrangement also aims to transfer skills and expertise from the\ninternational to the domestic consultants.", "4\nrental, food and refreshments, and other out-of-pocket costs of the workshops and\nseminars will be financed under the TA. It is expected that the TA will begin about April\n2000 and be completed within 24 months, on or about the end of March 2002.\n9. The consultants will be based at the Institutional Strengthening Unit of the PSD\nand will report to the secretary, PSD.  However, the consultants will be expected to\ninteract with, and, if requested, provide advice and support to, key officials of the\ncentral agencies of the Government, including the Office of the Prime Minister, Cabinet\nOffice, Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, offices of the Attorney General\nand Solicitor General, and Institute of Public Administration and Management.\n10. The international consultants will each be required to submit to ADB a brief\nprogress report at the end of each visit to the country, and a final report at the end of\ntheir consultancy. However, in the case of the team leader, a brief status report on the\nprogress of the overall TA should be provided regularly (at least on a quarterly basis),\nand a general final report upon the completion of the TA.\nIV.
