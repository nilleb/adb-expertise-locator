In 2012, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfor technical assistance (TA) for capacity development of tax officials as part of ongoing tax \nadministration  reforms  under  the  current  administration.  In  response,  ADB  conducted \nconsultation missions in 2012. During a fact-finding mission in January 2013, the BIR, the \ngovernment\u2019s  executing  agency,  agreed  on  the  proposed  impact,  outcome  and  outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference as laid out \nin the approved concept paper. The TA is included in the country operations business plan, \n2013\u20132015 for the Philippines.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  ADB\u2019s growth diagnostics study of the Philippines identifies that weak tax mobilization \ncapacity, and the resultant inadequate provision of infrastructure and underinvestment in human \ncapital, are major constraints on the country\u2019s inclusive economic growth.2 While the 2005 \nexpanded value-added tax reform temporarily improved the fiscal position, its gains were not \nsustained. Tax revenue fell to 12.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2009 from a peak of \n17.0% in 1997 and was the lowest since the 2005 reform. Revenue mobilization has since then \nbecome an urgent policy agenda  item for the current administration. While the recent tax \ncollection effort has increased tax revenues, the tax\u2013GDP ratio remained at 13.1% in the first 9 \nmonths of 2012.  \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s fiscal policy assessment in the country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132016 suggests \nthat weak tax administration remains a key constraint on revenue mobilization.3 According to \nADB  estimate,  the  country  could  improve  the  tax\u2013GDP  ratio  by  4.6  percentage  points  by \nincreasing tax productivity to 70% of the regional average in East Asia and Pacific countries.4 \nLow tax productivity in the Philippines points to untapped potential which could be mobilized \nthrough improved tax administration. The BIR, which is in charge of assessing and collecting all \ninternal revenue taxes has taken measures to improve tax administration, which include data \nconsolidation to identify nonregistrant taxpayers and suspected tax avoidance, intensified tax \npayer  audit,  and  the  Run  after  Tax  Evaders  Program. 5  The  government  has  recently \naccomplished reforms in excise taxes on tobacco and alcoholic drinks. However, increasing the \ntax\u2013GDP ratio to the government\u2019s target of 15.6%  by 2016 requires strengthening of tax \nadministration. \n \n4.  Capacity and resource constraints within the BIR help explain its short-term orientation \n(e.g., resorting to advanced collection of next period\u2019s tax liabilities from corporations) and \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 February 2013.

ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the Republic \nof the Philippines for Enhancing Revenue Collection and Strengthening the Criminal Prosecution of Tax Evasion \nCases. Manila. This TA has supported the BIR\u2019s revenue mobilization effort by improving the tax policy and \nstrengthening criminal prosecution of tax evasion. Major TA activities include development of an internal database \nat the National Prosecution Service to consolidate and share internal probable case rulings and decisions on Run \nafter Tax Evaders Program cases and related training, and capacity development of National Prosecution Service \nand BIR prosecutors. \n ", "2   \nabsence of programs to deal with medium-term challenges (e.g., tax arrears and the criminal \nprosecution of tax offenders).6 \n \n5.  Staff training is a central part of effective tax administration, and in many countries initial \ntraining and education for new recruits are a critical part of staff training policy; effective tax \nadministration  is  sustainable  only  with  highly  skilled  and  motivated  frontline  tax  officers. \nMoreover,  staff  training  and  education  can  serve  as  a  tool  for  attracting,  developing,  and \nretaining talent, which is particularly important for tax administration. At about 4%, the BIR's staff \nattrition rate, i.e., the number of staff departures compared with the total number of staff, is \nhigher than in other countries in the region (3% in Indonesia and 1% in Malaysia).7 Therefore, \ncapacity development of newly recruited staff is an urgent issue in the BIR, and indeed the \nBIR's  medium-term  strategy  recognizes  and  confirms  the  importance  of  highly  trained  tax \nofficers. For effective administration, the authorities need to strengthen tax officers\u2019 capacity, \nboth for the frontline operations of assessing and collecting taxes and the back office operations \nof  managing  taxpayer  accounts  and  records.  In  this  context,  the  government  decided  to \nestablish the Philippine Tax Academy in 2010 for systematic training of tax officers.8 Although \nthe  plan for the  Philippine  Tax  Academy  has not  yet taken  shape,  the  BIR  and  also the \nDepartment of Finance continue to stress the need to strengthen the BIR's capacity for staff \ntraining based on a systematic medium-term staff development strategy. Once the plan for the \nacademy materializes, a staff development strategy and training programs should be developed.  \n \n6.  ADB has conducted a preliminary review of the BIR\u2019s current training regime for new \nrecruits. It has been identified that (i) there is no medium-term training plan for new recruits, \nwhich covers systematic training for the first few years; (ii) although the General Course for \nRevenue Officers is conducted as an introduction course for new recruits, its duration (44 half \ndays) and curriculum do not satisfy the needs of new recruits; (iii) training materials do not \nadequately address specific skills required for tax officials, e.g., detection of malpractices and \ntax  avoidance;  (iv)  as  the  training  content  is  heavily  tilted  towards  the  assessment  area, \ncollection and other areas are not given enough weight; and (v) there are no full-time lecturers \n(trainers).9 Therefore, the current training system is neither well organized nor oriented toward \nthe specific skill upgrading that is needed to increase tax revenue collection by the BIR.  \n \n7.  In designing a staff development program, it is important to develop a medium-term \ntraining scheme with the right mixture of a series of class and on-the-job trainings at tax offices \nwithin  a  3\u20135-year  time  frame.  For  example,  in  Japan  the  National  Tax  College  provides \nnecessary training to all tax officials. The college, which consists of the main campus and 12 \nregional training centers, trains new recruits graduated from high schools and universities and \nprovides training programs for tax officials so they are fully equipped with necessary knowledge \nand skills for field activities. The programs cover a wide range of topics such as tax law, \nbookkeeping, accounting, and business analysis. Trainings at the National Tax College enable \nofficers to develop the capacity for both frontline and back office operations.  \n \n8.  Tax administration reform has been a focus area of development partner operations in \nthe Philippines. Starting with the World Bank\u2019s Tax Computerization Project in the 1990s, the \ncountry has received broad support from development partners. The World Bank supports tax \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2008. Country Assistance Program Evaluation for the Philippines.

The United States Agency for \nInternational Development has funded a performance management program within the large \ntaxpayer service and at the department director level. The Millennium Challenge Corporation \nhas  funded  extension  of  the  integrated  tax  system  through  acquisition  of  new  equipment, \nmodification of software, and training. The proposed TA will complement other development \npartners\u2019 past and ongoing efforts by focusing on capacity development of tax officers.  \n \n9.  Despite extensive support for capacity building provided by development partners in the \npast,  the  BIR\u2019s  tax  administration  capacity  remains  weak.  Lack  of  high-level  support  and \ncommitment undermined sustained efforts for better tax administration.10 Frequent turnover of \nBIR commissioner and key officials exacerbated the problem. Under the current administration, \nhowever, tax mobilization has become a top priority in the overall context of governance reform. \nThere has been steady progress in revenue mobilization by the BIR. The proposed TA is \ndesigned to support these efforts for strengthening tax administration. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be increased tax revenues to help the government fund increase in \npublic  spending  on  infrastructure  and  social  services.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  tax \nmobilizing  capacity  of  the  BIR  through  adoption  of  a  new  staff  training  system  for  newly \nrecruited tax officials. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will achieve its outcome by introducing a new and systematic approach to staff \ntraining  to  ensure  high-quality  standards.  The  current  training  policy  and  system  will  be \nreviewed under the TA, with a particular focus on new recruits, and their effectiveness for staff \ndevelopment will be assessed. The TA will assist in (i) developing a medium-term training plan \nfor new recruits, i.e., an initial 3\u20135-year training schedule; and (ii) implementing a more effective \ntraining  system,  consisting  of  appropriately  sequenced  classroom  courses  and  on-the-job \ntraining. Regional workshops on staff development systems will be organized under the TA to \nshare with BIR international best practice and help it establish institutional links with other tax \nadministration bodies in the region and key international organizations. The regional workshops \nwill help the BIR formulate a suitable staff training system by taking into account advanced staff \ntraining systems and the experiences of tax administration reforms in other developing countries \nin the region.  \n \n12.  Major outputs of the TA are as follows: \n(i)  International good practices of staff training and tax administration shared \namong regional partners. Regional workshops will be designed in coordination \nwith the BIR. Suitable regional partners for these workshops will also be selected \nin consultation with BIR. \n(ii)  A  training  strategy  and  medium-term  training  plan.  A  training  needs \nassessment will be conducted under the TA to review the current training policy \nand courses, including the General Course for Revenue Officers for new recruits, \n                                                \n10 R.

For  the  review  process,  internal \nconsultation  within  the  BIR  and  international  practice  acquired  through  the \nworkshops will be taken into account. A staff training policy and strategy will be \ndeveloped, and a medium-term training plan for new recruits, i.e., a 3\u20135-year \ntraining  schedule  which  will  consist  of  appropriately  sequenced  classroom \ncourses and on-the-job training, will be designed. Under the TA, proposals for \nbuilding stronger links between staff training and human resource management, \nfor example through a better profiling of revenue officers\u2019 competency, will also \nbe made.  \n(iii)  Revised training materials. Based on review of the current training courses, \nrevised training materials for more practical skill-oriented training will be prepared. \nThe  revised  materials  will  include  evaluation  of  training  participants\u2019 \nachievements and progress. In addition, web-based training materials, which \nenable distance training for regional revenue officers, will also be prepared. \n(iv)  Training of trainers seminars. A series of training programs will be conducted \nfor trainers to improve their teaching skills for more effective implementation of \ntraining  course.  The  TA  will  also  look  at  the  possibility  of  mobilizing  local \nresearch and training institutes for sustainable staff training for the BIR. \n(v)  A new or revised training course for new recruits. Under the TA, a new \ntraining course for new recruits will be launched, based on a medium-term plan \nfor building the capacity and skills of new recruits.11 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  office  accommodation,  staff,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The BIR will be the executing agency. It will provide office space with furniture and \nsupport  services  for  the  consultants,  and  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  management  and \ndecisions on project implementation. The TA requires four experts (two international consultants \nwith 26 person-months of inputs and two national consultants with 24 person-months of inputs). \nThe  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  on  an  individual  basis  in  accordance  with  its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time), on a competitive \nbasis  following  advertisement  on  the  ADB  website,  evaluation  of  expressions  of  interest \nreceived, and short listing of qualified experts. All procurement will be done in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The disbursement under \nthe TA will be done in accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas amended from time to time). Eligibility or ineligibility will be guided by Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction Policies and Guidelines for Technical Assistance. The consultants\u2019 terms of reference \nare in Appendix 3. \n \n15.  Following the signing of the TA agreement between the government and ADB, the TA \nwill be implemented from 1 May 2013 and will be completed on 31 December 2014.  \n \n                                                \n11  There were 77\u2013218 new recruits in the BIR in 2007\u20132012.
