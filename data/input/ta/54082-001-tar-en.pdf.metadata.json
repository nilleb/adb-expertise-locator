INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Mongolia has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to support improvements in its public sector management operations \nin order to safeguard and expand fiscal space in pursuit of sustainable growth and the equitable \ndelivery of public services. The government has requested ADB\u2019s support in three interrelated \nareas:  public  expenditure  management;  revenue  management  and  tax  data  analysis;  and \ncorporate governance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs),  especially in relation to financial \nplanning and management.1 ADB will deliver the support through a combination of analytical work, \npolicy recommendations, and capacity development. \n \n2.  The knowledge and support TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nMongolia, 2017\u20132020, which identifies public sector management as a key driver of sustained \ninclusive economic growth.2 The TA is included in the country operations and business plan for \nMongolia, 2020\u20132021.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Mongolia\u2019s key development challenge is to build a resilient and diversified economy that \nis less dependent on mining revenues, can foster sustainable and inclusive growth, and ensures \nthe equitable delivery of public services.4 A dependence on mining revenues, and the associated \nvulnerability to price fluctuations in international commodity markets, has made Mongolia\u2019s \nmacroeconomic and fiscal performance highly volatile. Since 1995, the country has experienced \nthree recessions and entered in six International Monetary Fund (IMF) programs. The 2016 crisis \nof twin deficits (fiscal and balance of payments) could be traced to two main structural problems: \n(i) persistent fiscal deficits and growing public debt, mostly associated with nonprudent fiscal \nmanagement and lack of fiscal buffers; and (ii) unsustainable balance of payment deficits linked \nto undiversified sources of foreign exchange (such as single-product and single-client exports, an \neconomic structure dependent on mining, a predominance of foreign direct investment, and \ngrowing sovereign debt). These boom\u2013bust cycles risk undermining the standard of living gains. \nThe sudden deceleration of economic growth during 2014\u20132016 led to a fall in employment growth \nand real wages, and an increase in poverty.5 \n \n4.  In addition, Mongolia is experiencing a severe economic slowdown because of the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The turmoil in the global economy, capital markets, \nand commodity markets because of the COVID-19 pandemic has weakened Mongolia\u2019s economic \noutlook. Consequently, gross domestic product (GDP) growth will be much lower in 2020 than \n \n1  During 1992\u20132017, ADB support for improved public sector management has evolved and touched upon a range of \nareas in response to the changing needs and demands of the country. Areas of support have included legal and \nregulatory reform, public financial management, public administration reform, sovereign wealth management, and \nSOE reform. A key high-level lesson is that Mongolia\u2019s inherently volatile economic and fiscal environment makes \npublic sector reform even more challenging, and this must be factored into the pace, complexity, and political \nfeasibility of reforms. ADB. 2018. Mongolia: Public Sector Management Factsheet. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2017. Country Partnership Strategy: Mongolia, 2017\u20132020\u2014Sustaining Inclusive Growth in a Period of \nEconomic Difficulty. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2020\u20132021. Manila. The TA was listed as Improving Fiscal \nManagement. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 August 2020. \n4  This has been well-documented in various publications, including ADB. 2019. Asian Development Outlook 2019: \nStrengthening Disaster Resilience. Manila; and IMF. 2019. Article IV Report for Mongolia. Washington, DC. \n5  World Bank Group. 2018. Mongolia Systematic Country Diagnostics. Washington, DC.  \n ", "2 \nenvisioned; ADB has revised the 2020 GDP growth forecast from 6.1%6 to \u20131.9%.7 A protracted \nglobal economic downturn would worsen this outlook considerably, possibly resulting in sustained \nnegative growth and requiring support beyond the scope of this intervention. \n \n5.  This potentially bleak economic outlook, combined with sizable external debt repayments, \nincluding maturing bonds during 2020\u20132024, presents important challenges for Mongolia\u2019s fiscal \npolicy and public financial management.8 This requires careful fiscal management along the lines \nof the Law on Fiscal Stability (2010) and close expenditure management to ensure that these \ngenerate strong value for money and reduce economic vulnerabilities.9 \n \n6.  The  Action  Program  of  the  Government  of  Mongolia  for  2016\u20132020  explicitly \nacknowledges that a well-functioning public administration and civil service, underpinned by \neffective  and  efficient  public  sector  management  systems  and  processes,  is  a  necessary \nprecondition to successfully manage the economy under such volatile circumstances.10 However,  \nthe strategic allocation and efficient use of public financial resources are hampered by  (i) \ninefficiencies in expenditure management and domestic resource mobilization, including tax \npolicy and tax administration; and (ii) weak corporate governance, in particular the financial \nplanning and management capacity of SOEs. \n \n7.  Expenditure management. Mongolia\u2019s capital expenditures averaged about 11% of GDP \nduring 2010\u20132016, far exceeding those of lower middle-income countries (4.8%) and East Asia \nand Pacific (3.0%). Total capital spending increased from 6.1% of GDP in 2010 to 12.4% in 2013, \nand then declined to 6.0% in 2015 before rising again to 9.9% in 2016. The composition of public \nexpenditure has been skewed toward investment as line ministries continue to prioritize new \nprojects over the provision of adequate funding for operation and maintenance of capital assets.11 \n \n8.  Moreover, Mongolia\u2019s public expenditure efficiency is low. The country ranked 102nd of \n141 countries on efficiency of public spending in the 2019 Global Competitiveness Index.12 The \nIMF\u2019s 2016 Public Investment Management Assessment for Mongolia revealed poor performance \nin public investment management practices.13 Mongolia\u2019s scores are much lower than those of its \nemerging market comparators. Weak public expenditure management has led to poor project \nselection, long project implementation delays, high cost overruns, and rapid deterioration of \nassets, thereby contributing to low investment productivity and spending efficiency. Improving \npublic investment efficiency should therefore be a high priority. \n \n \n6  ADB. 2019. Asian Development Outlook 2019: Strengthening Disaster Resilience. Manila. \n7  ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook Supplement 2020: Lockdown, Loosening, and Asia\u2019s Growth Prospects \nManila. \n8  Mongolia\u2019s total external debt repayment obligations during 2020\u20132024, including international bonds, external loans, \nand government guarantees, are forecast to be $5.9 billion. \n9  Mongolia could benefit from (i) ADB policy-based guarantees to improve the terms of commercial debt by extending \nmaturity, lowering interest rate costs, increasing issue amount and/or enabling access to new markets (loans and \nbonds), making commercial debt more suitable for development support (e.g., infrastructure projects and budgetary \nfinancing); and (ii) a pool of TA funds that ADB has set aside to strengthen debt management in its group B and C \ncountries. Discussions in this regard are currently ongoing between ADB\u2019s East Asia Department and the Strategy, \nPolicy and Partnerships Department. Support for the preparation of a possible policy-based guarantee has been \nincluded in the terms of reference of the international public expenditure management specialist and the resident TA \nand portfolio coordinator. \n10  Government of Mongolia. 2016.

Mongolia\u2019s revenue \nperformance has been highly volatile because of its exposure to global swings in commodity \nprices. Policy recommendations to mitigate this volatility have included (i) strengthening sovereign \nwealth management in line with international good governance and investment practices (e.g., \nthrough the independent offshore management of assets);14 (ii) increasing the non-mining share \nof overall tax revenue; (iii) increasing the comparatively low statutory taxes; (iv) reducing the high \nnumber of tax exemptions; and (v) strengthening tax collection and administration. The adoption \nand implementation of these recommendations have been hampered by the absence of a \ncomprehensive  assessment  of  the  institutional  arrangements  that  drive  domestic  resource \nmobilization. As a result, policy decisions on revenue management reforms and administrative \nstrengthening have not always been evidence-based and have tended to fail. \n \n10.  State-owned enterprise financial planning and management. A 2019 assessment by \nMongolia\u2019s Government Agency for Policy Coordination on State Property (PCSP) found that \nestablishing and maintaining good corporate governance standards in SOEs is essential to \nincrease the efficiency of their operations.15 The PCSP highlighted poor capacity for financial \nanalysis, planning, and management as a key corporate governance weakness that undermines \nthe efficiency of SOE operations, and considers strengthening this capacity to be a priority. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: create an effective and responsible fiscal \nsystem aimed at the efficient use of financial resources for socioeconomic development.16 The \nTA will have the following outcome: government\u2019s management of public finances and fiscal \nstability strengthened.17 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  Output 1: Public expenditure efficiency enhanced. In close consultation with the \ngovernment  and  relevant  development  partners,  the  TA  will  support  the  preparation  and \nimplementation of a strategic, policy, and technical road map that lays out measures to improve \nthe efficiency of public expenditures, focusing on aggregate fiscal discipline, strategic prioritization \n(allocative efficiency), and operational performance (technical efficiency). \n \n13.  Output 2: Institutional capacity for domestic resource mobilization improved. In line \nwith a strategic road map that is being developed with IMF assistance, the TA will support the  \n(i)  review  of  strengths  and  weaknesses  in  the  policy,  legal,  and  institutional \nframework for domestic resource mobilization; \n(ii)  identification of factors hindering the protection and optimization of domestic \nrevenue streams; maximization of revenue collection; implementation of effective \n \n14 ADB is supporting the Future Heritage Fund, Mongolia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, through the ongoing TA for \nEstablishing Sovereign Wealth Fund Management Institution (ADB. 2018.

ADB will continue its support after this TA \nends on 31 December 2020, including through possible support for the Fiscal Stability Fund, and has included a \nrelevant TA in the 2021 pipeline.  \n15 Government of Mongolia, Government Agency for Policy Coordination on State Property. 2019.

Output 3: Road map on state-owned enterprise corporate governance, including \nfinancial planning and management, developed. The TA will support the development of a \nstrategic  road  map  for  SOE  reforms  in  Mongolia  that  are  essential  to  ensure  SOEs\u2019 \ncompetitiveness, efficiency, and fiscal sustainability. The road map will be informed by national \nand sector diagnostics that will benchmark SOE governance and financial planning capacity \nagainst established international standards and will be used to identify major gaps and risk areas.  \nThe development of the road map will be complemented by capacity-building for the PCSP on \nSOE planning and financial management.19 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, of which $750,000 which will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6).20 The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 2. \n \n16.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff, \nsecretarial assistance, office accommodation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will administer the TA. The executing agency will be the Ministry of Finance, and the \nimplementing agencies will be Ministry of Finance, the General Department of Taxation, and the \nAgency for Policy Coordination on State Property.  \n18.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  22 December 2020\u201322 June 2024 \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Finance \nImplementing agencies  Ministry of Finance \nGeneral Department of Taxation \nAgency for Policy Coordination on State Property \n \n18 Output 2 is proposed to be complemented by capacity development support for the Data Analytical Unit, which has \nbeen established in the Risk Management Division of the General Department of Taxation. The support will be guided \nby a data and analytics strategy, which is being developed by the General Department of Taxation with support from \nthe IMF and will be financed from the Domestic Resource Mobilization Trust Fund (ADB. 2017. Establishment of the \nDomestic Resource Mobilization Trust Fund. Manila). \n19 Additional issues to be addressed include SOEs\u2019 organizational structure, key financial ratios, and capacity for \neconomic planning. \n20 The TA will be complemented by support for the reengineering and digitization of key business processes in the \nMongolian State Parliament, to be financed by Technical Assistance for the Digital Development Facility for Asia and \nthe Pacific.
