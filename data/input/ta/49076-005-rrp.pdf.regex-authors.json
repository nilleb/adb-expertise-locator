THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Damu Entrepreneurship Development Fund (Damu), to be guaranteed by the Republic of \nKazakhstan,  for  the  Supporting  Resilience  of  Micro,  Small,  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises \n(MSMEs) Finance Project. The report also describes the proposed administration of technical \nassistance (TA) to be provided by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund1 \nfor  Strengthening  Micro,  Small,  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprise  Finance,  and  if  the  Board \napproves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under the  authority  delegated to me  by  the  Board, \napprove the TA.2 \n \n2.  The proposed financial intermediation loan will provide local currency credit to sustain \noperations of and employment by MSMEs during the current economic slowdown. The TA will \nstrengthen  credit  origination  and management  of selected  participating financial  institutions \n(PFIs) to better serve MSMEs.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Kazakhstan\u2019s  economy  significantly  depends  on  hydrocarbons,  which  in  2015 \nrepresented 25% of its gross domestic product (GDP) and more than 70% of export revenues. \nWhile GDP growth was robust at an average 10.2% per annum during 2000\u20132007, economic \nperformance has been volatile since the 2008 global financial crisis. The economy rebounded \nwith an average GDP growth of 6.5% (2010\u20132013) but then declined to 4.2% (2014), dropped \nsharply to 1.2% in 2015, and is expected to remain subdued at 0.1% in 2016.4 The slowdown is \na result of a sharp drop in hydrocarbon revenues, the recession in the Russian Federation, and \nweakening  demand  from  Kazakhstan\u2019s  main  trading  partners.  The  reduction  in  foreign \nexchange income in 2015 prompted the central bank to move to a floating exchange rate regime. \nFrom 2014 to mid-2016, the tenge lost 55.8% of its value against the US dollar5 and, despite \nprice controls and a restrictive monetary policy, inflation nearly doubled to 13.6% at the end of \n2015, from 7.4% at the end of 2014.6 Improving MSMEs\u2019 productivity, and the resilience of \nmicroenterprises as a source of income for the low-income population, is essential to boost the \nnon-oil economy and reduce macroeconomic volatility. \n \n4.  While the cities of Astana and Almaty and the Atyrau region generated 42% of value \naddition in 2015, 86% of Kazakhstan\u2019s 17.5 million residents live in rural districts and regional \ntowns. Agriculture represents 24% of employment. In 2015, the rural poverty head count of \n4.7% exceeded the urban poverty head count of 1.4%, indicating that the rural population is \nprimarily engaged in low-productivity agriculture and trapped in low-wage jobs. Support of the \nrural economy is essential to sustain income for low-income families and create demand for \n                                                \n1  Financing partner: the Government of Luxembourg. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  The project is included in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: Kazakhstan, \n2016\u20132018.  Manila.  ADB  provided  project  preparatory  TA  for  Micro,  Small,  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprise \nDevelopment (TA 8918-KAZ).

", "2 \ngoods and services provided by MSMEs, including farmers. However, agricultural productivity is \nhampered by low standards of quality and inadequate infrastructure. Financial service coverage \nin rural areas is inadequate\u2014only 48% of rural adults have a bank account.7 \n \n5.  In 2015, Kazakhstan had 1.1 million MSMEs, of which 930,000 were sole proprietorships, \n176,000 small enterprises, and 2,900 medium-sized enterprises.8 Sole proprietors employed \n49% of MSME labor, followed by small (39%) and medium-sized (12%) enterprises. MSMEs \ncontributed  26%  of  GDP  and  32%  to  employment.  While  sole  proprietorships  display  low \nproductivity with an annual output per worker of $3,170 equivalent in 2015, their significance in \nproviding subsistence income especially in rural areas highlights their importance as social \nprotection for low-income households. With an annual output per worker of $27,000, small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are important for employment and income-generation. \n \n6.  A World Economic Forum business survey identified corruption, inadequate skills, and \npoor access to finance as major obstacles to competitiveness. The performance of the banking \nsystem is undermined by corruption, bureaucracy, related-party transactions, poor corporate \ngovernance, and imprudent lending, as witnessed by the very poor asset quality of banks.9 \nLimited access to finance is a key obstacle to stronger productivity by MSMEs.10  \n \n7.  While MSMEs contributed 26% to GDP in 2015, loans to MSMEs represented only 9.8% \nof GDP. Especially micro and small enterprises have insufficient documentation, credit history, \nand  property titles to  satisfy  bank  requirements. The  banks\u2019  lending policies  do  not focus \nenough on estimated business cash flows when assessing borrowers\u2019 creditworthiness. The \nhigh cost of originating loans and the recent history of poor credit underwriting led to high \nperceived risk in lending to small businesses and to high lending rates that make borrowers\u2019 \ninvestments unattractive.11 Only 19% of MSMEs have received a bank loan, so most fund their \ninvestments through retained earnings, and borrowings from family and friends (footnote 9). \n \n8.  The performance of the finance sector mirrors that of the economy. Economic shocks, \npoor credit underwriting, and currency devaluations have hurt the performance and stability of \nthe banks and eroded public confidence. In 2011\u20132013, the loan book expressed in dollar terms \ngrew by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.9%, medium-sized loans surged at a \nCAGR of 119.0%, and deposits grew at a moderate CAGR of 7.7%. In this period, profitability \nimproved from a negative return on assets to a positive one of 1.8%, and capital adequacy \nmodestly  improved  to  18.7%.  Asset  quality,  however,  remained  extremely  poor  and  the \nnonperforming loans ratio exceeded 30% in 2013. While banks\u2019 nonperforming loans ratio \nreportedly improved to 8% in 2015 as a result of write-offs and massive transfers to special \npurpose vehicles, doubts about the banks\u2019 asset valuation practices suggest that the reported \nimprovement of asset quality is overstated and that asset quality may drop again under the \n                                                \n7  World Bank.

The government classifies enterprises by the number of workers and by income. \nIn 2016, microenterprises have an annual income up to $184,000 equivalent or up to 15 employees; small \nbusinesses have less than 100 employees and up to $1.8 million annual income; and medium-sized businesses \nhave less than 250 employees and up to $18.4 million annual income. \n9  Sector Assessment (Summary): Finance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10 World Bank and International Finance Corporation. 2014.

The sharp devaluation of the tenge against the dollar (footnote 5) seriously affected the \nsolvency and profitability of some banks, including systemically important banks. Expressed in \ndollar  terms,  bank  loans  contracted  by  a  CAGR  of  27.3%,  and  loans  to micro  and small \nenterprises declined by a CAGR of 14.7% during 2014\u20132015. As a result, the banking system\u2019s \ndepth, expressed by the ratio of private sector credit to GDP, remained at a low 38% in 2015. \n \n10.  In 2015, banks were moderately capitalized, with a total capital adequacy ratio of 15.9%. \nWhile exceeding the regulatory minimum of 7.5%, banking system solvency remains highly \nsusceptible to the volatile economy and unresolved asset quality issues. The stress tests carried \nout  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund  in  the  context  of  the  financial  sector  assessment \nprogram conducted in early 2014 showed that the capital of many banks would not be able to \nsufficiently absorb shocks of the magnitude witnessed in 2014 and in 2015.13 The significant \nvolume of nonperforming loans will require write-offs and loan loss provisions over an extended \nperiod, and low net interest margins will limit banks\u2019 ability to generate additional capital through \nretained earnings. Additional capital will likely be needed to meet Basel III requirements, which \nare being phased in by the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) from 2015 to 2019. \n \n11.  High exchange rate volatility resulted in a surge of deposit dollarization from 35% (2010) \nto 70% (2015), while local currency loans represented 66% of loans in 2015. This led to \nsubstantial open foreign currency positions. Banks\u2019 lending in local currency was constrained by \nthe NBK\u2019s monetary policy and measures to counter currency speculation. In 2014 and 2015, \nthe NBK provided cross-currency swaps up to 12 months. Tenge funding is essential to help \nreduce currency-related risks of financial institutions and their borrowers. \n \n12.  Government\u2019s strategy. Recognizing their significance for employment, innovation, and \nnon-oil economic growth, the government is supporting MSMEs. The national development \nstrategy Kazakhstan 2050 targets to increase the contribution of SMEs to GDP to 50% by 2020. \nThe Roadmap for Business 2020, Employment Roadmap 2020, and the State Program of \nIndustrial and Innovative Development (2015\u20132019) contain measures for MSME support.14 \nLack of access to finance is identified as a key constraint to MSME growth. The government has \nin place several programs to support SME finance along with development partners.15 Those \nprograms are implemented through Damu, a government-owned agency mandated to provide \nloans and guarantees to MSMEs via financial intermediaries on commercial and concessional \nterms.16 \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s value addition. The project will provide loans for MSMEs and support financial \ninclusion, especially outside the two major cities, by providing funds for working capital and \ninvestment loans. Access to finance for businesses owned by women is encouraged through \nagreed lending targets and gender policies. To meet these objectives, the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) carefully selected PFIs that (i) have a significant regional footprint, (ii) have top \n                                                \n12 \u201cNonperforming loans\u201d should be interpreted with caution: rescheduled loans are not reported as nonperforming \nloans.  \n13 International Monetary Fund. 2014.

Critical  elements  of  the  ADB \npackage are (i) the provision of local currency loans to address foreign exchange risks of PFIs \nand its borrowers, (ii) partnership with suitable PFIs that compete in servicing MSMEs through \ndifferent approaches, and (iii) TA to strengthen the PFIs\u2019 credit risk management and their \nproduct offerings for MSMEs. \n \n14.  ADB sector experience and assistance program. Prior to the 2008 crisis, ADB had \nprovided  nonsovereign  loans  and  partial  credit  guarantees  to  four  banks.17 Since  2010,  it \nprovided sovereign loans through a multitranche financing facility (MFF) for SMEs via banks in \nan aggregate amount of $500 million equivalent.18 The facility is expected to close in 2017. \nWhile a countercyclical support facility in 2015 helped mitigate the economic shock, the project \ndesign reflects the need for extended support to the private sector (footnote 9). Lessons from \nthe MFF are embedded in the design of this project. First, while the MFF provided local currency \nto mitigate dollarization of loans to the banks and their customers, the swap instruments had to \nbe originated and repaid in bullet payments that were inadequate to match PFI funding needs. \nADB will now provide tenge through NBK, allowing periodic withdrawals through separate repo \ntransactions  that  fit  PFI  funding  needs.19 Second,  the  project  will  also  cover  low-income \nmicroenterprise borrowers through the participation of microfinance organizations and TA to \nsupport PFIs in servicing microenterprises. Third, a larger number of PFIs, the flexibility to \ninclude additional PFIs during project implementation, and allocation of funds based on actual \ndisbursement  performance  will  stimulate  PFI  competition.  Finally,  a  longer  implementation \nperiod provides flexibility to accommodate demand fluctuation in a volatile environment. \n \n15.  Development  partner  coordination.  The  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment, the International Finance Corporation, the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment, and the World Bank support MSMEs through (i) business development services, \n(ii)  assistance  in  introducing  credit  scoring  and  improving  lending  technology,  (iii)  cluster \ndevelopment, and (iv) loans and equity investments in banks. ADB is coordinating with these \npartners  and  focuses  on  mitigating  currency  risk  and  improving  PFIs\u2019  service  outreach  to \nMSMEs (footnote 15). \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  The impact will be a sustained contribution of MSMEs to Kazakhstan\u2019s GDP, which is \naligned with the government\u2019s objectives of supporting entrepreneurship and the contribution of \nMSMEs to the non-oil economy and employment under a challenging macro environment. The \noutcome will be that a sustainable provision of loans to MSMEs is maintained. \n \n                                                \n17 Alliance Bank (2006, $100 million partial credit guarantee and $50 million loan); Bank CenterCredit (2007, \nT6 billion loan); BTA Bank (2006, $75 million loan); and Kazkommertsbank (2007, $100 million partial credit \nguarantee). The loans to BTA Bank and Alliance were restructured and partly written off. \n18 ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to the Republic of Kazakhstan for the Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Program. Manila. \n19 The NBK liquidity facility will take the form of a repo agreement between NBK and ADB documented under a \nTBMA/ISMA Global Master Repurchase Agreement. As part of ADB\u2019s Borrowing Program for 2016, the Board \nauthorized ADB to source local currency to fund loans through cross-currency swap transactions and transactions \nof a similar nature. The repo facility with NBK has been structured to replicate the features of a swap, and therefore \nis considered in accordance with the Board\u2019s authorization. Local Currency Funding for ADB\u2019s Loan (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n ", "5 \nC.  Outputs \n17.  The project comprises the following outputs: \n(i)  Sustained  financial  inclusion.  The  project  will  fund  local  currency  loans \nthrough  PFIs  to  provide  working  capital  to  MSMEs,  enable  productive \ninvestments by MSMEs, and incentivize lending to women entrepreneurs and \nregions outside Astana and Almaty. 20 The PFIs will aim to fund at least (a) \n$50 million  equivalent  to  women-owned  businesses,  with  a  third  of  the  total \nnumber of subborrowers being women; and (b) $120 million equivalent to eligible \nsubborrowers outside the cities of Astana and Almaty. \n(ii)  Improved efficiency of PFIs\u2019 lending to MSMEs. The project will provide TA to \nimprove credit risk management and efficiency of selected PFIs, and to expand \nfinancing opportunities for MSMEs. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n18.  The project is estimated to cost $240 million equivalent. The government has requested \na loan of T72 billion (equivalent to $200 million) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help \nfinance the project. ADB will provide tenge through an innovative funding facility with the NBK, \nunder which NBK and ADB will execute repo transactions as required to accommodate the PFIs\u2019 \ndemand for funding to MSMEs (footnote 19). Damu will be the borrower of the loan, which will \nbe guaranteed by the Republic of Kazakhstan. The final maturity date of the loan will match the \ntermination date of the NBK\u2019s liquidity facility. The loan will have (i) an interest rate equal to the \nsum of ADB\u2019s cost of funding21 and the contractual spread for sovereign guaranteed loans; (ii) a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year on committed and undisbursed amounts commencing 60 \ncalendar days after the date of the loan agreement; and (iii) such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft loan, guarantee, and project agreements. The loan tenor will be 36 months. \n \nTable 1: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nOrdinary capital resources (loan)  200.0  83.3 \nSubborrowers (through equity contribution)  40.0  16.7 \nTotal  240.0  100.0 \nNote: Every $1.00 of an Asian Development Bank subloan is expected to mobilize, on average, an additional $0.20 \nof business investment on the assumption that the participating financial institutions (PFIs) will require eligible \nborrowers to provide on average 16.7% of a subproject\u2019s cost with equity. PFIs will have discretion to determine the \nsubborrower  equity  contributions  based  on  the  nature  of  the  credit  risk.  Although  not  part  of  the  PFIs\u2019 \ndisbursements to subborrowers, the National Bank of Kazakhstan requires the PFIs to hold $0.075 of capital for \neach $1.000 they onlend under the project. The equity capital and loan loss reserves are the first defenses against \nany subborrower payment defaults and ensure that the PFIs are incentivized to lend to creditworthy clients. \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates, Damu Entrepreneurship Development Fund, and PFIs. \n \n19.  Damu will relend the ADB loan proceeds to qualified PFIs that meet agreed selection \ncriteria, and pursuant to subsidiary loan agreements entered into by Damu and each PFI, on \nterms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. Each PFI will use the loan proceeds to finance \nsubloans up to $3 million equivalent to eligible MSMEs for investment and working capital \n                                                \n20 The cumulative amount of financing provided to MSMEs is likely to exceed the ADB loan amount because the PFIs \nwill utilize repaid subloan amounts to fund additional eligible subloans until the final maturity date of the Damu \nloans extended to PFIs. \n21 50% of the base interest rate published by the NBK as of the date of execution of the repo transaction, not less \nthan 7% per annum, repriced quarterly. \n ", "6 \npurposes. For microfinance organizations, the maximum subloan size will be determined by the \nregulations of the NBK.22 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  Damu will be the executing agency responsible for the administration and disbursement \nof the proceeds of the ADB loan. Qualified PFIs will be the implementing agencies.23 A project \nmanagement unit at Damu will administer the project, provide progress reports, oversee PFIs\u2019 \ncompliance with ADB loan and project agreements, and manage any issues in coordination with \nADB and the PFIs. The PFIs are expected to report the utilization of funds through loans to \nqualified MSMEs, covering the first and recurrent uses of funds until final maturity of the Damu \nsubsidiary loans to PFIs. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 2 and \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual (PAM).24 \n \n21.  Given the volume of trade flows with non-ADB members and the relatively small size of \nindividual transactions, a waiver to allow MSMEs to procure goods, works, and consulting \nservices from non-ADB member countries is requested from the ADB Board of Directors.25 \n \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2017\u2013June 2019 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2019 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2019 \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency  Damu Entrepreneurship Development Fund \n(ii)  Implementing agencies  Qualified PFIs: Asian Credit Fund (microfinance organization), Bank of \nAstana, Bank CenterCredit, Bank Kassa Nova, Bereke (microfinance \norganization), KazMicroFinance (microfinance organization), and Nurbanka \nRetroactive financing  Up to 20% of the loan amount can be used to finance eligible subloans \nmade by PFIs on or after the approval of the project by the ADB Board of \nDirectors and prior to the loan effectiveness date, but no earlier than 12 \nmonths before the signing date of the loan agreement. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB, including a \nminimum drawdown amount of $20 million. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PFI = participating financial institution. \na  Additional PFIs could be considered during project implementation, provided they meet the eligibility criteria for \nthe project and appropriate financial, safeguard, and integrity due diligence is conducted on each candidate. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n22.  Capacity development TA for Strengthening MSME Finance will help improve the credit \nrisk management of selected PFIs and expand financing opportunities for MSMEs. ADB will \nengage with Damu and selected PFIs in providing customized solutions to upgrade PFIs\u2019 credit \n                                                \n22 At the end of 2015, this was 8,000 times the monthly calculation index (set annually in the Budget Law), \ni.e., T17 million (equivalent to $46,000). \n23 A description of the PFIs preliminarily selected for the project is included in the Financial Analysis (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 The ADB Board of Directors must approve the waiver by a vote representing not less than two-thirds of the total \nvoting power of the members of the Board. The Board approved a similar waiver for the ongoing MFF that is \nsupporting SME financing in Kazakhstan (see footnote 18). \n ", "7 \norigination and management, and efficiency of service outreach to MSMEs.26 The TA output will \nbe improved capacities of the PFIs to better serve MSMEs. To improve the sustainability of \nADB\u2019s  credit  line,  the  TA  will  assist  the  PFIs  in  the  following  areas:  (i)  institutional \ndevelopment\u2014including market  analysis,  organizational  set  up,  introduction  of new  lending \ntechniques,  and  product  development  and  testing\u2014to  support  banks  in  downscaling  their \nlending operations to the smaller segments and development of new products for microfinance \norganizations;  (ii)  greater  efficiency  of  the  lending  process  and  management  of  corporate \ngovernance and risk issues; and (iii)improvement of internal audit functions. Given the limited \nTA resources, and to increase the impact of the intervention, the support will be provided \nindividually to a limited number of PFIs, which have confirmed management commitment to \nintroduce innovations that are scalable and can demonstrate improvements in reaching to the \ntarget groups (smaller businesses, rural areas, women entrepreneurs).   \n \n23.  The TA is estimated to cost $1 million, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Partnership  Special  Fund  (footnote  1)  and \nadministered by ADB. The PFIs will fund no less than 35% of each individual TA cost. The TA \nwill be implemented over 30 months. ADB will be the executing agency for the TA, with the \nCentral and West Asia Department acting as the focal point. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n24.  Sustaining access to finance in a volatile macroeconomic environment positively affects \nMSMEs\u2019 ability to maintain their operations, selectively invest in productive technologies, and \ngrow their businesses to reach economies of scale, thereby contributing to economic stability, \ndiversification away from the oil economy, and preservation of jobs. \n \n25.  ADB  and  Damu  selected four  banks  and  three  microfinance  organizations  as  PFIs \nwhose business strategies and performance provide a good fit with the project objectives. Most \nPFIs have significant MSME lending operations in the regions outside Almaty and Astana, i.e., \nmore than half of their loan books. Bank CenterCredit (BCC), a leading lender to SMEs with a \nvery strong branch network, serves more than 2,500 small enterprise borrowers with an average \nloan size of $80,000. ADB is familiar with BCC through the MFF since 2012. BCC displays a \nreasonable financial performance, and acceptable risk profiles and corporate governance. Bank \nKassa Nova, recently transformed from a microfinance organization into a bank that retains a \nstrong microbusiness focus, serves more than 3,100 clients for an average loan size of $30,000 \nequivalent. Bank of Astana (BOA) and Nurbank are smaller banks that recently began to target \nthe  MSME  segment.  BOA  has  370 MSME  clients,  with  an  average  loan  size  of  $90,000. \nNurbank has 800 SMEs as borrowers with an average loan size of $51,000. Nurbank and BOA \nhave managements that display strong commitment to expanding the MSME business.27 The \nparticipating  microfinance  organizations\u2014KazMicroFinance,  Asian  Credit  Fund  (ACF),  and \nBereke\u2014lend  almost  exclusively  in  rural  areas  and  work  well  with  women  borrowers. \nKazMicroFinance has over 151,000 borrowers with an average loan size of $682. ACF serves \n15,000 borrowers with an average loan size of $375. Bereke has 4,215 borrowers with an \naverage  loan  size  of  $945.  Competition  between  lenders that  use  different  strategies  and \ndistribution channels benefit the financing of small businesses. \n \n                                                \n26 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n26.  ADB carried out due diligence on each PFI and was satisfied with their ability to assess \nthe  creditworthiness  of  each  MSME  subloan  and  determine  the  commercial  terms  of  the \nsubloan based on their risk profile.28 Damu\u2019s capabilities to manage the borrowed funds and \ncomply with monitoring and reporting requirements are considered appropriate, as shown under \nprevious ADB projects, and will be further enhanced with additional Damu staff to monitor the \nimplementation of the project. Financial due diligence indicated that, within the given high-risk-\ncountry  environment,  the  PFIs  are  exposed  to  significant  risks,  given  their  modest  capital \nadequacy, poor asset quality, and weak profitability. To mitigate these risks, ADB will closely \nmonitor compliance of PFIs with the eligibility criteria in each disbursement and throughout \nimplementation.29 Additional PFIs that satisfy agreed eligibility criteria may participate. \n \nB.  Governance \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and requirements on financial \nmanagement, reporting and auditing, and environmental and social safeguards were explained \nto and discussed with Damu and the PFIs. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 24). \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s financial management and integrity due diligence on Damu and each PFI indicate \nmoderate risks. Damu\u2019s capabilities are considered adequate. However, as a government-\nowned institution, Damu\u2019s independence is somewhat affected by the direct influence of higher \ngovernment authorities. Integrity due diligence on Damu and the PFIs included the identification \nof ultimate beneficial ownership and presence of politically exposed persons, which was suitably \ndisclosed, and any issues were managed to ADB\u2019s satisfaction.30 All PFIs meet ADB\u2019s anti-\nmoney-laundering due diligence requirements. The PFIs\u2019 boards of directors and management \nboards  are  composed  of  experienced  professionals.  Internal  controls  are  generally  well \nestablished, including independent internal audit units that carry out risk-based audits and report \ndirectly to the supervisory boards.31 All banks have credit risk functions independent from credit \norigination. All PFIs are regulated by the NBK and prepare annual financial statements in \naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, audited by reputable audit firms. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n29.  The country\u2019s strong economic growth between 2010 and 2013 has reduced the poverty \nrate to 2.8% (2014) and the unemployment rate to 5% (2015).32 However, the rural poverty rate \nremains significant at 4.9%, and the current macroeconomic instability will potentially increase \n                                                \n28 NBK has established as a condition for providing tenge liquidity for this project that the maximum onlending rate to \nsmall and medium-sized subborrowers be not above the sum of (i) half the NBK\u2019s policy rate or 7%, whichever is \nhigher; and (ii) 8%. As of September 2016, this limit would be 15%, which is in line with market practices. This limit \ndoes not apply to lending done by microfinance organizations, which cannot provide loans over $50,000. \n29 Key selection criteria for PFIs are (i) compliance with NBK\u2019s prudential regulations, adequate asset quality, and \nprofitability; (ii) business strategies for and track record of serving MSMEs; (iii) presence of an environmental and \nsocial management  system that complies  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements  and national  laws,  and  appointment of \ndesignated staff to screen prospective subprojects; and (iv) preparation of complete financial statements in \naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, externally audited based on International Standards \nof Auditing. Financial Analysis and Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n30 Integrity due diligence identified politically exposed people in the ownership structure and management board of \nKassa Nova Bank. ADB\u2019s integrity due diligence has classified the risks as low. \n31 ACF (microfinance organization) has a lower internal audit capacity and relies on the support of an internal audit \nteam from Kompanion, a Mercy Corps subsidiary based in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n32 National Statistics Office of Kazakhstan. \n ", "9 \npoverty. Farmers and MSMEs, especially in the regions, will provide a buffer to such impacts by \nproviding subsistence income and employment.33 \n \n30.  At 68%, women\u2019s labor force participation is below that of men (78%). Women also \nrepresent a higher share of the unemployed (57% in 2015).34 An ADB survey carried out in 2015 \nfound that 58% of surveyed microenterprises owned by women had annual sales of up to \n$10,000, and focused on services (34%), trade (33%), and manufacturing (20%), mainly in food \nand  garments.  This  highlights  the  significance  of  microfinance  for  female  entrepreneurs. \nEncouraging  women  entrepreneurship  helps  broaden  the  base  for  economic  growth  and \nprovides employment and income opportunities for women and their families. The project is \ncategorized as effective gender mainstreaming because it is expected to contribute to women\u2019s \nempowerment through the actions described in the gender action plan and the targets set in the \ndesign and monitoring framework. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n31.  Subprojects will comply with Kazakh labor, environmental, health, safety, and social laws \nand regulations, as well as safeguard policies in para. 29 of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). The project is categorized as financial intermediary with respect to environment and as \nfinancial  intermediary  (treated  as  C)  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples. \nSubprojects  will  not  be  eligible  for  ADB  financing  if  they  (i)  appear  on  ADB\u2019s  Prohibited \nInvestment Activities List, or (ii) have involuntary resettlement or indigenous peoples impacts, or \nare classified as environment category A. As for environment, PFIs may either (i) exclude all \nprojects with environmental impacts that exceed category C,35 or (ii) permit subprojects that are \nclassified B and C. ADB will require PFIs to maintain an environmental and social management \nsystem (ESMS) that complies with ADB\u2019s requirements and national laws, and have designated \nstaff trained in implementing the ESMS to screen prospective subprojects, as a condition to \nparticipate in this project.36 PFIs and Damu will provide to ADB semiannual ESMS monitoring \nreports during implementation. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.37 Some significant risks are related to the \nvolatile economic operating environment and can only be partly mitigated through the project as \ndescribed. However, ADB\u2019s position is protected by the strong credit of the sovereign, which \nguarantees the loan. The project is categorized as low risk because (i) the size of the loan \namount does not exceed $200 million, (ii) ADB and Damu have adequate mechanisms to \noversee the performance of PFIs and experience in supporting MSMEs in Kazakhstan, and \n(iii) Damu has a solid track record in managing ADB\u2019s and other externally funded projects. The \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n \n                                                \n33 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy and Sector Assessment (Summary): Finance (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n34 Kazakhstan ranks 47th out of 145 countries in the Gender Gap Index 2015.
