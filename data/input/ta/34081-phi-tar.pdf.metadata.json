A prerequisite for economic growth and social development is a stable society, and the \ncornerstone is a judiciary that dispenses, and is seen to dispense, fair and impartial justice, \nefficiently and effectively. The Supreme Court of the Philippines is aware of the challenges it \nfaces and is actively responding to them. It has taken concrete steps to establish a strong \nfoundation for the long-term development of the judiciary. With assistance from international \nfunding agencies, the Supreme Court undertook several studies to assess the extent of change \nneeded, and recommend reforms. The Supreme Court established a project management office \n(PMO),  headed  by  a  full-time  director,  to  manage  the  studies  and  coordinate  the  reform \nproposals.  An executive committee (the Executive Committee) headed by the chief justice was \ncreated to provide overall policy direction for the reforms. The result of these efforts, the Action \nProgram for Judicial Reform (APJR), was adopted by the Supreme Court in November 2000. \nThe APJR has received strong support from the executive branch. \n \n2.  Among  the  goals  of  the  APJR  are  fiscal  autonomy;  independence  from  political \ninterference; and fair, speedy justice.  The Government of the Republic of the Philippines has \nrequested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide advisory technical assistance (TA) to \nadvance APJR components in these areas.  An ADB Fact-Finding Mission was fielded in \nOctober 2000 and reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, \ncosts, and implementation arrangements for this TA.  The logical framework is attached as \nAppendix 1. This TA is in line with the APJR and is included in the 2001 Philippine country \nassistance plan.1 \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n \n3.  The Philippine Constitution sets up a government with three separate, independent, but \ncoequal  branches.  Congress  writes  the  laws  and  appropriates  the  budget.  The  executive \nensures compliance with the laws. The judiciary interprets the laws, resolves disputes, and \ndefines the boundaries of government authority. As the judiciary has no instrument of power \nother than the power of its decisions, structures must be established to protect its independence \nand integrity. The Philippine Constitution takes the first step in this direction by recognizing that \nthe judiciary must have fiscal autonomy.2  \n \n4.  Jurisprudence defines fiscal autonomy as freedom from outside control in determining \none\u2019s  needs,  and  full  flexibility  in  allocating  and  using  one\u2019s  resources.  In  practice  the \nexecutive\u2019s Department of Budget and Management reviews and revises the judiciary\u2019s budget \nbefore submitting it to Congress.  It also subjects the judiciary\u2019s budget, obligation programming, \nand cash releases to the same terms and conditions applied to other agencies without fiscal \nautonomy. This has forced the judiciary to negotiate budget items with the executive on a \ntransaction-by-transaction basis, and has compelled lower courts to accept subsidies from local \ngovernments. The judiciary\u2019s level of fiscal autonomy fluctuates with changes in government \nleadership, thus undermining its impartiality and rendering it vulnerable to political change. \n \n5.  The  judiciary\u2019s  resource  constraints  are  aggravated  by  a  lack  of  administrative \nautonomy. The evaluation and approval of salary grades; changes in staffing patterns; and \ncreation, abolition, reclassification, and upgrade of positions are subject to the same review and \napproval procedures applied to executive agencies. This has resulted in work-task duplication, \nunderstaffing, inappropriate skills mix, and inefficiencies. \n \n                                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) on 27 October 2000. \n2  \u201cThe Judiciary shall enjoy fiscal autonomy. Appropriations for the Judiciary may not be reduced by the legislature \nbelow the amount appropriated for the previous year, and after approval, shall be automatically and regularly \nreleased.\u201d (Sec. 3, Art. VIII) ", "2  \n6.  Fiscal independence and accountability are vital to the development of the Philippine \njudiciary.  However,  to  reap  their  benefits  and  ensure  the  long-term  sustainability  of  the \ndevelopments, the judicial appointments system must also be reformed. The Judicial and Bar \nCouncil was created to prepare an exclusive list of names from which the President can choose  \nappointments or promotions to the Supreme Court and the lower courts. The current rules and \nprocedures for screening and nominating judges and justices must be improved to ensure that \nthey are transparent and respond to the need to nominate competent and impartial members of \nthe bench. In the case of promotions, the rules and procedures also have to be linked to a \ntransparent and systematic performance monitoring and evaluation system.  \n \n7.  Further, it is also essential that the Supreme Court be able to detect inefficiencies and \ncorruption in the courts, and effectively impose discipline. The Philippines currently has no \ninstitutionalized, systematic, performance monitoring and evaluation of such things as legal \nability, case-flow management, comportment in and out of court, impartiality, appropriateness of \nthe judge\u2019s manner and initiatives, and reasonableness of opinions. The absence of such \nmechanisms contributes to the erosion of public confidence in the judicial system. This public \nsupport is imperative if the judiciary is to maintain its role as an independent and accountable, \nthird-branch of government.  \n \n8.  A parallel step toward judicial independence and impartiality is strengthening the bench. \nUnfortunately, the lower courts have many vacancies, equivalent to one third of the judicial \nposts.3  Therefore incentives and institutional support must be improved to encourage capable \ncandidates to volunteer for judicial posts, and encourage desirable incumbents to remain in \ngovernment service.  The judiciary\u2019s salary scale must be improved as it is far lower than that of  \ncomparable  institutions;  good  performance  needs  to  be  recognized  and  rewarded;  and \nindividual efforts to maintain an appropriate level of expertise must be supported through \ncontinuous,  deliberate,  and  properly  managed  judicial  education.  The  Philippine  Judicial \nAcademy (PhilJA) was established to train judges, justices, court personnel, and aspirants to \njudicial posts. PhilJA has a critical role in upgrading the qualifications of incumbents on the \nbench.  It  has  also  started  a  prejudicature  program  for  candidates  to  the  bench.  A \ncomprehensive conceptual framework for judicial education will help assist PhilJA execute its \nmandate. \n \n9.  Providing  support  for  judicial  reform  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  objective  to  improve \ngovernance. Independent, accountable, impartial, and competent judiciaries serve as a defense \nagainst  corruption,  reduce  political  interference  in  the  dispensation  of  justice,  enhance \ntransparency, and help reduce waste of public funds. Judicial reform is central to predictability, \none of four essential elements in ADB\u2019s governance policy.4  Independent judicial institutions \nensure (i) participation (by giving the public a hearing through public interest litigation), (ii) \ntransparency (by upholding laws that require disclosure of information), and (iii) accountability \n(by granting citizens the right to challenge government actions before the judiciary). Additional \ninformation is available in Appendix 2. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n10.  The goal of the TA is to contribute to the improvement of the Philippine judiciary by \nsupporting its independence, accountability, impartiality, and competence. Under the TA, (i) a  \n                                                                 \n3  Trial court judge to population ratio is about 1:35,200.  As of 31 October 1999, 709  of 2,130 trial court were vacant. \nThese include the first level trial courts, which administer justice in municipalities and cities, and the second-level \ntrial courts, which handle civil and criminal cases, and cases on appeal from the first level trial courts.  \n4  R151-95: Governance: Sound Development Management, 17 August 1995. ", "3  \nframework  for  the  judiciary\u2019s  fiscal  and  administrative  autonomy  will  be  designed,  (ii)  the  \nappointment process and the accountability and incentive system under which the judges and \njustices function will be improved, and (iii) the capacity of PhilJA to deliver judicial training will be \nstrengthened.  \n \nB.  Scope \n \n11.  The TA will develop a framework to define the overall scope of judicial independence \nand accountability.  A budget and revenue system will be designed to translate the framework \ninto operational systems and guidelines for budget preparation, programming, and commitment, \ndisbursement of funds, accounting procedures that meet Commission on Audit requirements, \nperformance-based accomplishment reporting to Congress, and revenue generation actions. \nThe  judiciary\u2019s  administrative  structure  will  be  reengineered  to  achieve  suitable  skills-mix, \nstaffing structures, and organizational and functional configurations for the courts; improve \naccountability and transparency; and ensure integration of functions and operating systems.  \nThe  Supreme  Court  and  the  relevant  executive  agencies  will  be  reviewed  to  identify \nimpediments to judicial independence and accountability, and to develop fiscal systems for the \njudiciary that are consistent with the principles of judicial independence and prudent public \nexpenditure practices.  Appropriate amendments consistent with the Philippine Constitution will \nbe recommended.  On the basis of this work, assistance will be provided in the preparation of \nthe judiciary\u2019s 2003 budget. \n \n12.  The TA will conduct a detailed analysis of the legal and institutional framework for and \nactual implementation of the screening and nomination of judges and justices. On the basis of \nthe review, the existing institutional arrangements, processes, and rules will be reformulated to \nenhance transparency and civil society\u2019s participation in the screening and nomination of judges \nand  justices.  Performance  standards  will  be  established  for,  among  other  things,  ethical \nconduct,  judicial  reasoning  and  writing,  case-flow  management,  and  court  efficiency.  A \nperformance monitoring and evaluation system (PMES) will be developed to ensure that good \nperformance  is  recognized,  and  deficiencies  identified  and  disciplined.  Data  on  case-flow \nmanagement, currently being gathered by the Office of the Court Administrator, will be taken \ninto account in setting the standards. The PMES will be linked to the screening, nomination, \npromotion, and discipline process. Proposals will be made for establishing a judicial tenure \ncommittee under the supervision of the Supreme Court to operate the PMES and assist the \nJudicial and Bar Council with the preliminary screening of candidates for appointment and \npromotion.  \n \n13.  To  improve  the  incentives  system,  a  career  program  linked  to  the  PMES  and  a \ncompetitive compensation-retirement plan will be designed for the bench. To support individual \nefforts to improve competence, a conceptual framework for judicial education will be developed \nto  set  educational  goals  and  a  value  system,  identify  areas  for  education,  and  propose \neducational  methods.  Using  the  conceptual  framework,  PhilJA\u2019s  curricula  will  be  refined, \nreoriented,  and  enriched.  Distance  training  modules  will  be  designed  for  regular  courses \nidentified by the Supreme Court, PhilJA, and ADB.  Classroom-based and distance training \nmodules will be designed to train the judiciary in the use of the new systems developed under \nthe TA.  With assistance from ADB, PhilJA will deliver classroom-based courses at its campus \nin Tagaytay, and deliver courses by distance training throughout the country. \n \n14.  The Ministry of Justice of the Government of Japan will offer a 3-4 week training course \nin Japan for about 10 court administrators, executive judges, and PhilJA trainers who will be \nselected based on criteria agreed between the Supreme Court, PhilJA, and ADB. The courses \nwill be on performance evaluation, court administration, judicial career development, and judicial  ", "4  \neducation. The curriculum will be set upon consultation among the Ministry of Justice of the \nGovernment of Japan, PhilJA, and ADB.   \n \n15.  A conference will be held at ADB to present the findings and reforms drafted under the \nTA.  The Supreme Court, with assistance from TA consultants and ADB, will conduct nationwide \nworkshops and dialogues to discuss the TA reforms with stakeholders including incumbent and \nretired members of the bench, court administrators and personnel, members of the bar, bar \nassociations, law schools, members of Congress, and government officials.  Feedback from \nthese sessions will be considered in finalizing the TA reforms. Tools for implementing the \nreforms, including necessary legislative, regulatory,  and administrative enactments, will be \ndesigned or formulated and the cost for reforms estimated. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.878 million equivalent, of which $740,000 is the foreign-\nexchange cost and $1.138 million equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $1.200 million equivalent, covering $640,000 of the foreign exchange \ncost and $560,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government of Japan, acting \nthrough the Ministry of Justice, will provide in-kind services for the overseas training program \nvalued at the equivalent of about $100,000. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis \nfrom the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance \nthe remaining local-currency cost, equivalent to $578,000, covering administrative and support \ncosts including salaries of counterpart staff, secretarial support, office supplies and equipment, \noffice  accommodation,  local  transportation,  miscellaneous  costs  for  dialogues  and  training \ncourses, and per diems associated with attendance at such events. Details of the cost estimates \nare set out in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The Supreme Court will be the Executing Agency; it will ensure that the PMO continues \nto be headed by a full-time director, is always adequately staffed, and has at least one full-time \nproject officer reporting to the director to supervise day-to-day implementation of the TA. The \ndirector will ensure coordination among the Judicial and Bar Council, PhilJA, Office of the Clerk \nof  Court,  Office  of  the  Court  Administrator,  the  clerks  of  court  of  the  Court  of  Appeals, \nSandiganbayan, Court of Tax Appeals, TA consultants, and other stakeholders. The PMO will \nreport monthly to the Executive Committee to update it on the TA reforms. The Executive \nCommittee, and when necessary the Supreme Court, will regularly review the reforms and \nprovide  policy  direction  to  ensure  acceptability  of  the  final  proposals.  To  ensure  proper \nsynchronization and acceptability of judicial reforms outside the judiciary, the Supreme Court \nwill coordinate and liaise with the Presidential Committee on Effective Governance, a committee \ncomposed  of  the  Executive  Secretary,  the  Secretary  of  the  Department of Finance, the \nSecretary of the Department of Budget and Management, the Chairman of the Commission on \nAudit, and the Secretary of the National Economic and Development Authority.  The TA will be \nimplemented  over  a  period  of  18  months  commencing  in  December  2001.  Complete \nimplementation is expected by May 2003.  \n \n18.  Seventeen person-months of international consulting services will be required in the \nareas of constitutional and administrative law of comparable constitutional systems, judicial \nappointments  and  career  development,  performance  evaluation,  fiscal  and  administrative \nmanagement of courts, and physical assets management. Reports will be required to outline the \nframework and processes of comparable constitutional systems, explain their theoretical and \nphilosophical underpinnings, compare them with the Philippine system, and recommend a \ndirection for fiscal and administrative independence and accountability, judicial nominations, and \ncareer development. The reports will be reviewed by the Supreme Court and ADB, and used as ", "5  \na guide to formulate the reforms and strategies for advocating the reforms. Ninety person-\nmonths of domestic consultants\u2019 services will be required in constitutional and administrative \nlaw,  budget  planning  and  management,  financial  planning  and  management,  revenue \ngeneration, administration, corporate planning, asset management, procurement, auditing, staff \nreengineering,  personnel  management,  career  development,  performance  monitoring  and \nevaluation, and training.  The consultants will be engaged as a firm, under one contract, and will \nbe  headed  by  a  domestic  consultant  team  leader  with  expertise  in  project  management, \nfinancial management, and administration.  A resource person with expertise in the budgetary \nprocess  of  comparable  court  systems,  and  a  resource  person  involved  in  performance \nevaluation of judges and justices, will be separately engaged to make presentations and provide \ninputs at the conference to be held at ADB. \n \n19.  The consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  by  Asian  Development  Bank  and  its  Borrowers,  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the recruitment of domestic consultants. The outline terms of reference  \nare attached as Appendix 4. \n \n20.  An inception meeting will be held within one month after engagement of the consultants.  \nFive months thereafter, the Supreme Court and ADB will review the progress of the TA and the \nconsultants will submit a preliminary report on the findings and reforms being developed. The \nconference at ADB will be held about two months after submission of the report, and promptly \nthereafter the consultants will submit to the Supreme Court and ADB a report on the results of \nthe conference. The consultants will help organize workshops and dialogues. They will submit \nreports of the proceedings of such interactions promptly after they are held. A draft final report \nwill be submitted to the Supreme Court and ADB within 10 months after inception, and a final \nreport no later than a month after the draft final report is approved by the Supreme Court. The \nreports will include the reports of the international consultants, the reforms developed under the \nTA, and draft legislation if necessary. The PMO will prepare a project completion report within \nthree months after completion of the TA to assess and evaluate the achievements of the TA. \n \n21.  Training courses developed under the TA will be subject to PhilJA\u2019s approval. After the \nacceptance of the final report and approval of the training courses, PhilJA will deliver the \ncourses,  with  assistance  from  the  consultants.  Trainers  from  the  academe  and  the  legal \nprofession will be directly recruited as resource persons, in accordance with arrangements and \ncriteria satisfactory to ADB, to help deliver most of the training courses. The consultants' team \nwill help PhilJA prepare a report on the delivery of the training programs. The Supreme Court, in \nconsultation with PhilJA and ADB, will select about 10 court administrators, executive judges, \nand PhilJA trainers to participate in the overseas training program. After completion of the \noverseas training course, the participants will be required to become regular resource persons \nfor PhilJA.  \n \n22.  Computers and other necessary information technology equipment will be procured by \nthe consultants, in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB, to assist them in their work.  \nAfter completion of the TA, the equipment  will be transferred to the Supreme Court. \n \n \nV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n23.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  the  provision  of  technical \nassistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Republic of the Philippines in an amount \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $1,200,000 to Strengthen the Independence of the Judiciary.

Executive Review of the Judiciary's Budget\n1.  One  of the  systems with which the  Philippine Government  is constitutionally\ncomparable is the United States (US) Federal Government. Both have three separate,\nindependent but coequal branches of government.  In both cases, the legislatures have\nthe  power of the \"purse strings,\" the executives have the \"power of sword,\" and the\njudiciaries  have the least coercive of the three powers - the power of judicial  review.\nBecause both systems require that courts be able to review the acts of the President and\nCongress,  and  because of the passiveness of the  instrument of judicial  power (i.e.,\njudicial  decisions),  the  systems  have had to  actively protect the  independence  and\nintegrity of their judiciaries.\n2.  The Philippines has specified in its constitution that the judiciary will be fiscally\nautonomous. The US has prohibited its President from changing the budget proposed by\nthe judicial branch of government. In fact, to maintain full separation and independence\nof all three branches, the US President is also prohibited from changing the proposed\nlegislative budget. Thus,\n\"(b)  Estimated  expenditures  and  proposed  appropriations  for  the\nlegislative branch and the judicial branch to be included in each budget\nunder subsection (a)(5) of this section shall be submitted to the President\nbefore  October  16 of  each  year and  included  in the  budget  by  the\nPresident without  change.\"  (United States Code Annotated,  Title  31,\nChapter 11, Section 110 5(b), emphasis supplied)\n3.  The  basis  of the  Department of Budget and  Management for  reviewing  and\nrevising the judiciary's budget despite Section 3, Article VIII of the Philippine Constitution\nis another constitutional provision that requires the President to submit an annual budget\nto Congress. Section 22, Article VIII of the Philippine Constitution provides-\n\"The  President  shall  submit to  Congress within  thirty  days  from  the\nopening of the regular session, as the basis of the general appropriations\nbill, a budget of expenditures and sources of financing, including receipts\nfrom existing and proposed revenue measures.\"\nCompare this provision with the following US statute that requires the US President to\nsubmit an annual budget and proposed appropriations to Congress, notwithstanding the\nprohibition against changing the budget of judiciary:\n\"xxx The  President shall include in each budget the following: xxx (5)\nexcept  as  provided  in  subsection  (b)  of  this  section,  estimated\nexpenditures and proposed appropriations the President decides are\n(Reference  in text: page 2, para. 9)", "12 Appendix  2, page 2\nnecessary to support the Government in the fiscal year for which  the\nbudget is submitted and the 4 fiscal years after that year;\" (United States\nCode Annotated, Title 31, Chapter 11, Section 110 5(a)(5))\n4.  As can be seen from the US model, an obligation on the part of the President to\nsubmit  an  annual  budget  is  not  necessarily  inconsistent with  a  prohibition  against\nchanging the budgets submitted to the President by the judicial and legislative branches.\n8.  A Comparison  of Salary Scales\n5.  A municipal trial court judge  receives a basic salary of P19,500 a month and\nallowances of approximately P9,900 a month, for a total of about P29,400 a month.  A\nregional trial court judge receives gross compensation of about P35,OOOa  month.  First\nyear associates in top law firms in Makati receive annualized salaries (14 - 18 months\nequivalent) of approximately P600,000 to P800,000; senior associates, with 4 - 5 years\nof  work  experience,  receive  annualized  salaries  of  approximately  P1,OOO,OOOto \nP1,200,OOO.\nc. The Judicial Bar and Council (JBC)\n6.  Structurally, the JBC is under the supervision of the Supreme Court. The chief\njustice is the ex-officio chairman.  The other members are the secretary of justice (ex-\nofficio),  a  professor  of  law,  a  retired  justice  of  the  Supreme  Court,  and  one\nrepresentative each from the legislature (ex-officio), the Integrated Bar of the Philippines\n(IBP), and the private sector. The professor, retired justice, and representatives of the\nIBP and the  private sector are appointed  by the  President with the  consent  of the\nCommission  of  Appointments.  However,  the  judges  and justices  appointed  by  the\nPresident from the list prepared by JBC need no confirmation from the Congressional\nCommission on Appointments.
