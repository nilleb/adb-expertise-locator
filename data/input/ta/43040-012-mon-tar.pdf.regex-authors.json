INTRODUCTION \n1.  After the award of the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mining concession in 2009, there are \nprospects for Mongolia\u2019s gross domestic product to triple within 10 years. To proceed on this \nhigh-growth  track,  Mongolia  will  need  massive  infrastructure  investments.  According  to  its \nNational Development Strategy,1 the road sector is expected to implement a large program of \nroad sector investments in a short time, and then to manage the new road assets efficiently. As \na first step toward assisting Mongolia in scaling up the size and quality of its road sector \nactivities, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) prepared a sector capacity assessment study.2 At \nthe government\u2019s request, ADB subsequently provided small-scale technical assistance (TA)3 to \nsupport  the  government  and  sector  stakeholders  to  prepare,  in  a  participatory  manner,  a \nNational Road Sector Capacity Development Roadmap. \n \n2.  The government has asked ADB for capacity development TA to assist in the initial \nimplementation of the road map\u2019s main capacity development activities and planned reforms. \nThis report is based on understandings reached with the Government of Mongolia and the \nmission\u2019s observations in the field during the TA fact-finding mission fielded in October 2010. It \nreflects agreements reached on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, \ncost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services for the TA.4 The \nGovernment of Japan indicated its agreement to finance the TA on 3 May 2011. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Mongolia\u2019s  small  and  low-quality  road  network  is  a  significant  constraint  to  wider \ndevelopment and poverty reduction. Most of the roads connecting landlocked Mongolia to its \nneighbors are dirt roads. Many roads in rural areas are in poor condition, frequently impassable, \nand dangerous. Linked to this, Mongolia is experiencing rapid rural\u2013urban migration to the \ncapital city, Ulaanbaatar, which provides better economic opportunities. The city\u2019s infrastructure \nhas not kept pace with demand. From 1998 to 2008, Ulaanbaatar\u2019s population grew from \n660,000 to 1.05 million and the number of vehicles on the roads increased by 150%. During the \nperiod, the capacity of the city road network barely expanded, its quality deteriorated, and \naverage traffic speed fell by half. \n \n4.  The  government  now  wishes  to  address  the  limitations  in  the  road  sector  in  a \ncomprehensive way. Mongolia\u2019s transport sector strategy and priorities are established in the \nnational development strategy. The government plans to use mining revenues to expand the \nnational paved road network from 2,180 kilometers (km) in 2009 to 5,572 km in 2016, and to \nconstruct or rehabilitate 500 km of urban roads. This is expected to support mining sector \ndevelopment and enable broad-based economic growth. \n \n5.  The  implementation  of  this  investment  program  will,  however,  pose  significant \nchallenges. Under the government\u2019s program in the national development strategy, the annual \nphysical output of the road industry would need to quadruple in 10 years. There is also a need \nto improve the quality of road construction and maintenance works. The ADB sector capacity \nassessment revealed significant bottlenecks that the government would need to address to \nexpand road sector capacity successfully:  \n                                                 \n1  Great  Hural  of  Mongolia.  2008.  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)-Based  Comprehensive  National \nDevelopment Strategy of Mongolia. Ulaanbaatar. \n2  ADB. 2011. Mongolia: Road Sector Capacity Development to 2016. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Preparing the National Road Sector Capacity Development \nRoadmap. Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 July 2011. \n ", "2   \n(i)  The existing processes, technology, and organization for road construction and \nmaintenance  are  suitable  for  small-scale  works  but  not  for  larger-scale \noperations.  \n(ii)  The  planning  process  is  not  conducive  to  efficiency.  Necessary  planning \nprocesses have  frequently  been  bypassed,  and  priorities  have  tended  to  be \ninfluenced predominantly by political and other non-economic considerations, \nresulting in fragmentation of resources and a low degree of implementation of \napproved plans. \n(iii)  The present level of road maintenance financing covers only 20% of estimated \nneeds. In these conditions, only minimal routine maintenance is performed, and \nthere is no funding for the periodic maintenance necessary to sustain the service \nquality of the road network in the long term. \n(iv)  The road sector agencies do not have the required implementing powers and \nhuman capacity to deliver the new construction program efficiently and quickly. \nThe  distribution  of  responsibilities  for  works  planning,  procurement,  and \nimplementation involves too many different parties. \n(v)  Mongolian contractors have an estimated capacity to undertake 250 km of road \nconstruction works annually. Unless their capacity is quickly expanded, foreign \ncontractors will have to implement the largest share of the road construction \nprogram, which would limit the benefits to the Mongolian economy. \n(vi)  The  human  resources  of  the  road  sector  are  limited  to  500  engineers  and \n5,000 skilled workers. Twice as many engineers and 40% more workers are \nneeded. The skills of many engineers also need to be improved. However, only \n10\u201320 new road engineers graduate each year, and skilled workers are being \nabsorbed by the mining sector.  \n \n6.  In the past, ADB and other development partners have advocated improved planning, \nbetter institutional management, and policy reforms in the road sector. This helped to raise \nawareness  among  sector  stakeholders  about  capacity  development  needs,  but  leadership \nchanges hampered progress. A consensus has emerged within the government, interested \nprivate-sector groups, and development partners that the road sector needs comprehensive \ncapacity development and reform, and that this should be approached in an incremental rather \nthan  drastic  way.  With  this  understanding,  in  2009  the  government  reestablished  the \nDepartment of Roads (DOR) as the government agency for road construction and management. \nWith ADB support, it convened sector stakeholders working groups5 to prepare the road map.  \n \n7.  The road map (Appendix 2) establishes medium- and long-term performance objectives \nfor the road sector in terms of the capacity to plan and deliver investment projects, to maintain \nroads in good condition, to develop human resources, and to transfer technology. Under the \nroad  map,  the  Ministry  of  Road,  Transportation,  Construction  and  Urban  Development \n(MRTCUD) has adopted the following policy directions: \n \n(i)  Place  responsibility  for policy  implementation  in  the  hands  of  more efficient, \nsufficiently staffed, autonomous, and performance-oriented organizations\u2014the \nDOR for national roads, and the Capital City (Ulaanbaatar) Roads Department \n(UB DOR) for urban roads. \n(ii)  Establish a fair, sufficient, and stable funding source for maintenance by aligning \nuser charges with costs attributable to road users and increasing the share that is \nearmarked for maintenance through the Road Fund, with part of the proceeds to \nbe used to fund a periodic road maintenance program. \n                                                 \n5  Comprising representatives of road agencies, other ministries, road sector professional associations, the chamber \nof commerce, Ulaanbaatar University, and the road construction and consulting industry. \n ", "  3\n(iii)  Increase transparency and stakeholder participation by creating an independent \nbody with stakeholder representation (Road Board) to control the use of Road \nFund proceeds. \n(iv)  Gradually change from carrying out maintenance by force-account to contracted-\nout performance-based maintenance. \n(v)  Mandate the use of plan-based priority-setting and decision-making procedures \nin allocating funds. \n(vi)  Increase incentives for contractors to produce quality works, and have stricter \nsupervision. \n \n8.  The  government  expects  that  the  implementation  of  these  changes  will  lead  to  a \nsmoother  implementation  of  its  infrastructure  investment  plan,  and  better  quality  road \nconstruction  and  maintenance  works.  This  will  contribute  to  regional  integration,  reduced \nisolation of remote areas, and improved productivity of urban centers. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  impact  of  the  proposed  TA  will  be  improved  road  sector  performance  and \ngovernance, as measured by indicators including (i) the proportion of projects implemented \nwithin budget and according to schedule, (ii) the condition of the road network, and (iii) the \naggregate production capacity of the domestic road industry. The TA will help the government \nimplement key policy actions under the road map during 2011\u20132013. The TA outcome will be \nincreased capacity to plan and execute road construction and maintenance. Specifically, the TA \nwill  (i)  improve  the  performance  and  governance  of  road  sector  agencies and  institutions; \n(ii) increase the sustainability of the maintenance regime; (iii) enhance road agencies\u2019 planning, \ncontract management, and road maintenance capacity; and (iv) support the development of \nroad sector education, training, and technical research institutions. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.   The  TA  will  have  two  outputs.  Under  the  first  output,  the  TA  will  advise  on  the \npreparation of implementation plans for priority capacity development activities and reforms \nunder the road map. Under the second output, the TA will support their implementation and \nbuild  capacity  in  the  areas  of  institutional  management,  road  maintenance,  contract \nmanagement, investment planning, human resources, and technological development. \n \n11.   Output  1:  Policy  advice  on  road  map  implementation. This output will help the \ngovernment prepare detailed implementation plans in five areas: (i) road agencies\u2019 restructuring \nand  human  resources  development,  (ii)  Road  Board  establishment  and  Road  Fund \nrestructuring, (iii) road periodic maintenance program design, (iv) urban road maintenance, and \n(v) road research and technology development. Consulting services will assist the government \nand other sector stakeholders to assess current issues and bottlenecks, identify implementation \noptions, and build consensus on preferred implementation options. During this preparatory \nphase,  the  consultants  will  prepare  as  inputs  to  the  discussions:  (i)  a  forward-looking \nassessment of human resource capacity and training needs of DOR and UB DOR, (ii) a road \nuser charges review, (iii) a review of DOR\u2019s periodic maintenance plan (prepared with its road \nasset management system) and implementation strategy, (iv) an assessment of urban road \nmaintenance needs, and (v) an assessment of applied research and technology transfer needs. \n \n12.   The  implementation  plans  will  include  (i) an  institutional  and  human  resources \ndevelopment plan for the DOR and UB DOR; (ii) a proposal for restructuring the Road Fund and \n ", "4   \nestablishing the Road Board, including legal amendments; (iii) an urban road maintenance \nstrategy; (iv) a strategy for scaling up education, training, and scientific research programs; and \n(v) a medium-term research program. \n \n13.   Output 2: Capacity building on road map implementation. This component will assist \nthe government to (i) reengineer sector institutional arrangements, (ii) introduce sustainable \nmaintenance practices, (iii) enhance civil works procurement processes, (iv) enhance transport \ninvestment planning and project cycle processes, and (v) develop road sector education and \ntechnical research capacity. The component will combine the following activities: \n(i)  Change management support. The TA consultants will advise sector decision-\nmakers on the implementation of the road map\u2019s key reforms. They will help \nprepare the operational documents necessary to reengineer sector institutions \nand create new entities planned under the road map. The consultants will also \nprovide advice to stakeholders who assume new functions. \n(ii)  Process and systems development. The consultants will help strengthen the \nstandards,  manuals,  and  support  systems  in  the  areas  of  (a) periodic \nmaintenance management; (b) urban road maintenance; (c) civil works project \nmanagement;  (d)  construction  supervision  and  quality  assurance;  and \n(e) investment planning, project appraisal, and evaluation. \n(iii)  On-the-job  training.  Through  a  combination  of  international  advisors  and \nembedded national consultants, the consultants will provide on-the-job training \nand assistance in the areas of periodic maintenance management, road works \nmanagement and supervision, and transport planning. \n(iv)  Education and formal training. The consultants will prepare a curriculum for \nroad engineer retraining. They will develop training modules for road managers, \nengineers,  and  economists;  and  seek  to  establish  partnerships  with  foreign \neducational institutes or professional organizations. Under the TA, a first batch of \ntraining modules will be delivered, in association with local training providers and \neducation institutions to ensure sustainability. \n(v)  Knowledge  products.  The  TA  will  support  sector  scientific  capacity  by \n(a) implementing  small-scale  priority  studies  under  the  medium-term  sector \nresearch program; and (b) translating into Mongolian and disseminating technical, \nscientific, or educational documents relevant to the road sector. \n(vi)  Public outreach. The consultants will publicize and disseminate the road map, \ne.g., by raising awareness of the changes and reporting on the implementation \nprogress to the public, such as via TV, radio, and/or by setting up a website. \n(vii)  Monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  consultants  will  assist  the  road  map \nimplementation committee and external stakeholders in monitoring progress on \nroad map implementation, on a quarterly basis. At the end of the TA, a capacity \nassessment will be performed to evaluate progress and to agree on a midterm \nupdating of the road map. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,300,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB (Appendix 3). The \ngovernment agreed to finance the balance of $300,000 equivalent, including $130,000 in kind \nby  providing  counterpart  staff,  furnished  office  facilities,  and  local  transport  required  for \nimplementing the TA, $70,000 for research equipment, and $100,000 for the in-country training \nprogram.  The  TA  will  also  seek  financial  participation  from  private  companies  for  training \nprograms opened to private sector employees. \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented from September 2011 to September 2013. The executing \nagency  will  be  the  MRTCUD.  A  high-level  steering  committee  will  monitor  the  road  map \nprogress, solve major implementation issues, and submit reform proposals to the government. It \nwill  be  chaired  by  the  deputy  prime  minister,  include  high-level  representatives  of  the \nUlaanbaatar  government  and  relevant  ministries,  and  meet  at  least  semiannually.  At  the \ntechnical  level,  an  implementation  committee  will  guide  and  coordinate  the  road  map \nimplementation, facilitate consultants\u2019 access to officials, and discuss issues and decide on \nwhen to report them to the high-level steering committee. The implementation committee will \nmeet  at  least  quarterly.  It  will  be  chaired  by  the  director  general,  DOR,  and  include \nrepresentatives of the MRTCUD, the DOR and UB DOR, the Ministry of Finance and at least \none  nongovernment  professional  association.  The  DOR  and  UB  DOR  will  have  the \nresponsibility  to  prepare  measures  under  the  road  map  and  implement  them,  acting  as \nimplementing agencies in their respective areas of responsibility. \n \n16.  The MRTCUD will form a road map coordination unit, under the DOR, to coordinate on a \nday-to-day basis the implementation of the road map and TA, program the TA activities, and \nreport activities to the implementation committee and ADB. It will be headed by a high-level \nofficial and include at least one other professional staff. UB DOR will nominate a TA coordinator \nto  supervise  consultants\u2019  activities,  assist  them  in  undertaking  their  services,  and  provide \ninformation and data. The stakeholder working groups formed during preparation of the road \nmap or subgroups nominated by the DOR will meet regularly to review progress and review the \noutputs  of  the  consultant.  With  the  assistance  of  MRTCUD\u2019s  monitoring  and  evaluation \ndepartment, they will prepare recommendations to the implementation committee. \n \n17.  The TA will require 47 person-months of international and 150 person-months of national \nconsulting services to carry out the work defined in the terms of reference (Appendix 4). ADB \nwill engage an international consulting firm in association with a national consulting firm using \nthe full technical proposal procedure. In selecting this firm, a weight of 90% for quality and 10% \nfor cost will be used, reflecting the strategic importance that the government attaches to the \nquality of the TA. To facilitate TA implementation, ADB will also engage an individual national \nproject management consultant. All consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The proceeds of \nthe  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Procurement of equipment and software will \nfollow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n18.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to the Government of Mongolia to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Road Sector Capacity \nDevelopment. \n \n ", " \n6\n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n  Performance Targets and Indicators with  Data Sources and    A\np\nDesign Summary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks  pe\nn\nImpact      Assumption  d\nix\nImproved road sector performance and  By 2016:  MRTCUD and DOR annual  Political will to make the   1\n \ngovernance  activity report  road sector more efficient \n70% of contracts executed on time and within \nand performance-oriented \nbudget, against less than 20% in 2009 \nRisk \nDomestic contractor capacity sufficient to perform \nEconomic downturn disrupts \n80% of roadworks, against less than 50% in 2009 \ncapacity development \n80% paved roads are in average or good  efforts  \ncondition, against less than 30% in 2009 \nOutcome      Assumptions \nIncreased capacity of road agencies to  By December 2013:  Road map quarterly  Increased financing \nplan and execute efficient road  progress report  available for road \nNew sector institutional structure is implemented. \nconstruction and maintenance  maintenance \nMRTCUD and DOR annual \nA Road Board consisting of a majority of user \nactivity reports  Human resources base of \nrepresentatives controls maintenance spending. \nsector institutions is \nPeriodic maintenance program, developed using  increased \nthe DOR\u2019s road asset management system, is \nRisk \nongoing. \nPolitical interventions \nSupervision of civil works valued above  hamper detailed investment \n$10 million is outsourced.  planning and execution. \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
