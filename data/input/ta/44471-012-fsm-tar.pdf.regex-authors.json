INTRODUCTION \n1.  Basic infrastructure systems, such as power, transportation, and communications, are \nessential for the economic development of a country. The proposed technical assistance (TA) \nwill  (i) support state  utilities  within  the  Federated  States  of  Micronesia  (FSM)  in  executing \ninfrastructure projects more effectively by having an agreed upon approach to systems and \nprocedures for project planning, design, and management across the country; and (ii) build \ncapacity in the Department of Transportation, Communications and Infrastructure (DTCI) to \nplan, design, and oversee project execution. The TA was included in the country operations and \nbusiness  plan,  2011\u20132013  at  the  request  of  the  national  and  state  governments.1 The \ngovernment  was  consulted  and  has  agreed  with  the  proposed  impact,  output,  outcomes, \nimplementation arrangements, cost and financing arrangements, and terms of reference for \nconsultants.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  FSM  exhibits  the  characteristics  of  a  fragile  state.  Capacity  for  development \nmanagement  is  limited,  governance  systems  are  undeveloped,  and  performance  of  past \nprojects was not satisfactory. While the government is committed to its Strategic Development \nPlan,  2004\u20132023,  limited  capacity  within  the  national  and  state  governments  to  plan  and \nmanage the implementation of infrastructure projects is hindering development.3  \n \n3.  Economic growth in the FSM in the medium term is estimated at 0.6%. Private sector \ngrowth is sluggish. Because the FSM lacks effective power, transportation, and communication \ninfrastructure, foreign investors\u2019 commitment to the country is weak. Better project management \nwould support timely execution of projects and hence would meet the conditions for drawdown \nof infrastructure grants under the Compact of Free Association.4 \n \n4.  The 2004\u20132023 Infrastructure Development Plan highlighted the need for a high level of \nprogram  management,  technical  skills,  and  financial  and  reporting  skills  for  the  detailed \nplanning,  technical  analysis,  resource  mobilization,  financial  management,  and  reporting \nsystems  that  would  be  required.  However,  limited  needs  assessments  and  little  capacity \nbuilding at any level has been undertaken. \n \n5.  Progress is hampered, in particular, by undefined procurement processes and building \nstandards, and disagreement within the FSM about project management processes (as well as \nunresolved land issues, inadequate long-term planning, lack of funding for maintenance, and \nlack of technical capacity).5 These issues are compounded by unclear legal and regulatory \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank. 2010. Country Operations Business Plan: Federated States of Micronesia, 2011\u20132013. \nManila. The FSM Constitution established three levels of government: (i) national, (ii) state, and (iii) municipal. The \nnational government\u2019s powers are expressly delegated and provide for matters of foreign affairs and defense, \ntaxation, regulation of banking, and coordination of foreign assistance. State governments have exclusive powers \nto deal with local issues and all residual powers. Both national and state governments may (i) appropriate public \nfunds; (ii) borrow money on the public credit; and (iii) establish systems of social security and public welfare.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 August 2011. \n3  Government of the Federated States of Micronesia. 2004.

The Compact of \nFree Association between the governments of the United States and the FSM, signed in 1982 and renewed in \n2003 for 20 years, provides for US economic assistance to and defense of the FSM in exchange for US defense \nand operating rights, including denial of access to FSM territory by other nations and other agreements. \n5  Government of the United States. 2009.

DTCI is the executing agency for almost all government infrastructure projects, including \nthose funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). In the absence of a common project \nmanagement system, processes, and basic standards between DTCI and the state utilities (as \nimplementing  agencies  for  many  infrastructure  projects),  projects  cannot  be  implemented \neffectively. However, the state utilities are accountable to the state governments\u2014not to the \nnational government.6 With regard to proper project implementation, DTCI can only negotiate,  \npersuade, and influence the state utilities.  \n \n7.  However, DTCI has implemented a number of infrastructure projects at the request of \nstate governments, in recognition of the state\u2019s capacity constraints. In addition to having an \noversight role for almost all infrastructure projects, DTCI also provides capacity support to the \nstate implementing agencies.  \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s project completion reports identify procurement and project management issues \nas  causes  of  project  implementation  delays  and  unsatisfactory  outcomes.7 The  review  of \ngovernance and capacity building gaps in DTCI in 2010 found four main constraints on effective \nproject implementation in its infrastructure division:8 \n \n(i)  The  overall  capacity  of  the  infrastructure  division  is  weak,  particularly  in \ninfrastructure  design,  project  management,  asset  management,  financial \nmanagement,  procurement,  and  risk  management.  The  division  has  specific \nskills gaps in asset planning and capital works programming, and has only one \nqualified civil engineer.  \n(ii)  Processes relating to project design and delivery, management of consultant \nprocurement,  and  risk  management  are  not  consistently  defined,  applied,  or \nunderstood within the divisions of DTCI. Consequently, DTCI\u2019s ability to influence \nthe state utilities in implementing proper processes is very weak.  \n(iii)  State  utilities,  as  a  consequence,  do  not  define,  apply,  or  understand  the \nprocesses. The ability of DTCI to plan and oversee infrastructure implementation \nis  severely  limited  because  project  definition and  costing  are  undertaken  by \nstates  and  then  approved  by  the  National  Office  of  Statistics,  Budget  and \nEconomic  Management,  Overseas  Development  Assistance  and  Compact \nManagement and the Joint Economic Management Committee, and the budget is \nappropriated before assessment, review, and tendering by DTCI.  \n(iv)  Governance issues arise at project inception through indecisive and risk-averse \nmanagement, unclear and uncoordinated project description and design, and \nlack  of  project  ownership,  compounded  by  the  reluctance  of  DTCI  staff  to \nproperly manage consultant project managers. \n \n9.  The absence of agreed systems and processes for planning, designing, and managing \nprojects and the limited capacity of DTCI constrain effective project implementation in the FSM. \n \n                                                \n6  Because the project management unit within DTCI implements Compact infrastructure grant projects, DTCI does \nwield some influence during implementation, but not in the selection of projects. \n7  ADB. 2002.

The TA is aligned with (i) ADB's Strategy 2020, which defines infrastructure as a core \narea  of  operations;9 (ii) ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Approach,  2010\u20132014,  which  addresses the  lack  of \ninstitutional and human capacity development and skilled and qualified labor within the fragile \nstates of the Pacific;10 and (iii) ADB\u2019s Integrating Capacity Development into Country Programs \nand Operations: Medium-Term Framework and Action Plan, 2007\u20132010.11  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  that  states  receive  adequate  support  to  execute \ninfrastructure investment projects. The outcome will be that DTCI will have improved capacity to \nplan and oversee the execution of infrastructure projects.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will support the delivery of two outputs: (i) systems and procedures for project \nplanning, design, and management agreed upon by DTCI and state utilities; and (ii) DTCI staff \nresources having the knowledge and skills in selected areas to plan, design, and oversee \nproject execution. \n \n13.  Output 1\u2500Systems and procedures for project planning, design, and management. \nProject  planning,  design  and  management  frameworks,  systems,  and  procedures  for \ninfrastructure  investments  will  be  reviewed,  updated,  and/or  developed  with  DTCI  in \nconsultation with the state utilities of Yap, Pohnpei, Kosrae, and Chuuk. This includes manuals \non (i) planning of civil works, (ii) contracting of civil works, and (iii) management and supervision \nof  civil  works.  Procedures  for  coordinating  DTCI  and  state  utilities  in  planning,  design, \nimplementation, and supervision of infrastructure investments will be developed. A contract \nprocedures manual will be designed with DTCI and the four state utilities.  \n \n14.  A document management and a management information system will be designed and \nimplemented to facilitate organizational efficiency  within DTCI. These systems will also  be \naccessible by the state utilities. The need for further procedures manuals will be assessed, and \nmanuals produced, as required. \n \n15.  Agreement between DTCI and state utilities on the proposed project planning, design, \nand  management  system  design  and  implementation  arrangements  will  be  essential. \nImplementation  of the agreed  upon  approach within  DTCI  will  include  ongoing monitoring, \nassessment, and review throughout the term of the TA.  \n \n16.  Output 2\u2500DTCI staff knowledge and skills improvement. An in-depth assessment of \nthe capacity of DTCI staff and long-term contractors to plan, design, implement, and supervise \ninfrastructure  projects  will  be  carried  out.  This  will  form  the  basis  for  tailored  capacity \ndevelopment programs for each division of DTCI. It will include formal and nonformal training.   \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "4   \nClassroom training will be complemented by on-the-job training, where trainees will participate \nin procurement activities, contract administration, and project supervision.   \n \n17.  The technical training programs will cover (i) introduction to infrastructure design, (ii) \nproject management, (iii) asset management, (iv) financial management, (v) procurement, (vi) \ncontract  administration,  and  (vii)  risk  management.  Climate  change  adaptation  will  be  an \nintegrated part of all technical courses. The design of the capacity development program will be \nbased on a modular approach, and training manuals will be produced for all subjects. Train-the-\ntrainer programs will be undertaken to create a permanent capacity within DTCI to train new \nstaff. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The Government of FSM has requested ADB to finance $700,000 equivalent. The TA \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by \nADB. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation; \naccess to telephone, facsimile, and internet facilities at the office of the DTCI; and other in-kind \ncontributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB will be the executing agency, and DTCI will be the implementing agency. The TA \nwill require 25 person-months of international consultants: (i) an institutional strengthening and \ndevelopment  specialist  (17  person-months);  (ii)  an  infrastructure  management  capacity \nspecialist (5 person-months); and (iii) a capacity development expert (3 person-months). A \nnational consultant with capacity development expertise will be hired for 12 person-months. All \nconsultants will be hired on an individual basis, and all consulting services will be rendered \nintermittently.12 Consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time.) All procurement will be done in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nProceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will be implemented \nover 3 years starting on 1 December 2011 and ending on 30 November 2014.  \n \n20.  A steering committee comprising senior management and change champions within \nDTCI and the four state utilities will be established within 1 month of approval of the TA. The \nsteering  committee  will  provide  guidance  and  direction  for  TA  activities  to  ensure  (i) \nsustainability of outputs and outcomes, and (ii) that the TA activities are inclusive and engage a \nconsultative and collaborative process. An inception workshop will be organized to discuss \npreliminary findings and issues with key stakeholders. A clear and coherent communication \nstructure and monitoring and evaluation process will be designed and implemented to support \nthe  steering  committee.  The  steering  committee  will  receive  quarterly  progress  reports, \nparticularly on the change management process and the capacity development program.   \n   \n                                                \n12  The most appropriate consultants are likely to be hired as individuals, as only a small number of consultants is \nrequired, and the selection criteria specify a combination of technical skills and North Pacific experience.  \n ", "  5 \nIV.
