The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has enormous human and socioeconomic \ntoll on the Indian population. The government and society are taking measures to contain the \ninfection.  Vaccination  is  a  critical  strategy  to  combat  the  formidable  virus.  India  already \ncommenced implementation of a national vaccination program since 16 January 2021. The \nproposed Responsive COVID-19 Vaccines for Recovery (RECOVER) Project under the Asia \nPacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX) will provide the government with immediate and flexible \nfinancing to procure safe and effective vaccines to inoculate around 97 million people from priority \npopulation  according  to  the  government\u2019s  national  deployment  and  vaccination  plan.1 The \nindicative impact is universal access to good quality health care services achieved.2 The financing \nis expected to be $1.5 billion under rapid response component of the APVAX. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  Since  the  first  COVID-19  case  was  reported  in  India  on  30  January  2020,  India\u2019s \ncumulative confirmed cases rose to 21.5 million with 234,083 deaths, as of 7 May 2021. India is \ncurrently going through the second wave, with over 6.1 million new cases and around 53,000 \ndeaths reported within a span of 17 days between 21 April and 7 May 2021. The pandemic and \nthe public health measures to curb the spread of the virus including lockdowns have severely \naffected the population, especially the poor and disadvantaged groups.3 With the severe second \nwave, India\u2019s health system is struggling with high demand for hospital beds, life-saving oxygen, \ntherapeutics, and medical personnel. The government is taking steps to address these issues, \nbut immediate support is very much needed to address the hike in demand due to the rapidly \nincreasing caseload.  \n \n3.  Vaccination  is  key  to  reverse  the  negative  impacts  of  the  pandemic  by  preventing \ninfections and protecting the population from death and morbidities as well as allowing the \neconomy and society back to the pre-COVID-19 development trajectory. Building upon the \nUniversal Immunization Program (vaccination for children and pregnant women), India quickly \nenhanced the systems for the unprecedented national vaccination program.4 India\u2019s vaccination \nprogram started from health care workers and frontline workers since 16 January 2021. On 1 \nMarch 2021, the coverage was expanded to those above 60 years of age and those above 45 \nyears of age with comorbidities (a list of 20 comorbidities was outlined to substantiate vaccine \neligibility). Thereafter, the priority groups were expanded, first, to all persons above 45 years of \nage from 1 April 2021, followed by anyone above 18 years from 1 May 2021. The country has \nadministered 164 million vaccine doses: 10.7% of the population has received at least one dose \nof the vaccine and 2.5% have received both doses as of 7 May 2021. Private sector providers \nwere roped in to increase coverage since 1 March 2021, and their roles have become increasingly \nimportant as the government allows the private sector to directly procure and deliver vaccines \n \n1  India\u2019s official request to access the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX) is currently pending subject to the \ngovernment\u2019s internal approval process. The beneficiary number is indicative, assuming two-dose regime, $7 per \ndose, and 10% waste rate, which are subject to further assessment as the vaccine supply market rapidly changes.  \n2  Aligned with Government of India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW). 2017.

It is the largest mass vaccination program ever tried in human \nhistory, and this requires strong planning and monitoring capacity to respond to emerging \nsituations while coordinating across numerous stakeholders in a complex federal governance \nsystem. Further, Indian vaccine manufacturers are expanding production capacity, which has \nimplications for the containment of the pandemic in the region and beyond. India also donated \n7.35 million doses of vaccines to its neighboring countries.5  \n \n4.  While the vaccination is open to everyone in the priority groups (now by age cohort), there \nare several demand side constraints, especially for the poor, women, older people, persons with \ndisabilities, residents in rural and remote areas, and other disadvantaged minority groups who \nmay not have adequate information and awareness of benefits and risks of vaccines, may face \nphysical distance, or lack mobility, and other socioeconomic barriers to vaccination. Women could \nbe less prioritized for vaccination as their role for family care requires less activities outside of \ntheir residence, but they are still exposed to the virus through other family members. Women\u2019s \nrole in family care makes it even more important that women are vaccinated. For herd immunity, \ndisadvantaged groups should be prioritized as they can be source of further outbreak unless they \ndevelop immunity and break the chain of infection. With the current surge, lots of volunteers, \ncommunity groups, and the private sector are providing support to communities, but with little \nguidance and resources. Helping them to effectively and safely provide services to others is \nimportant to contain infection as well as facilitate vaccination access.  \n \n5.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) will (i) provide emergency supply of oxygen to \nreduce  fatalities  from  the  second  wave  of  COVID-19  pandemic,  and  (ii)  build  capacity  of \nstakeholders to effectively implement the national vaccination program by addressing the gap \nareas identified by the due diligence assessments of the proposed RECOVER Project under \nAPVAX.6 The RECOVER Project will provide vaccines eligible under APVAX criteria while the TA \nsupport will provide catalytic operational support through a program management unit, monitoring \nof vaccination sites, building private sector capacity for vaccination, strengthening biomedical \nwaste  (BMW)  management  capacity,  effective  risk  communication  targeting  disadvantaged \ngroups,  improved  outreach  employing  solar-powered  cold  chain  equipment,  and  providing \nevidence-based policy inputs to enhance health system preparedness for future pandemics.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.  The outputs and activities are described below.7 \n \n7.  Output  1:  National  vaccination  program implementation  supported.  This  output \nwould focus on strengthening central level vaccine deployment policy and state level deployment \nactivities through capacity building and oversight. The Universal Immunization Programme has \nbeen centrally driven over the past several decades. As the states are taking the responsibilities \nfor procuring and delivering COVID-19 vaccines, the central government would coordinate various \nresources to support states and build state capacity through supportive oversight in different \naspects of vaccination program. This output will assist Ministry of Health and Family Welfare \n(MOHFW) (i) to establish a program management unit (PMU) under its Immunization Division to \nprovide support and guidance to states in responding to emerging concerns while following the \n \n5  This includes 3.3 million doses for Bangladesh, 1.7 million for Myanmar, 1.1 million for Nepal, 550,000 for Bhutan, \n200,000 for Maldives, 500,000 for Sri Lanka. India also donated to 47 other countries globally.  \n6  The TA and the ensuing loan were not included in Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) current country operation and \nbusiness plan as they are proposed to respond to the ongoing second wave of COVID-19 pandemic. \n7  Summary of Activities and Performance Indicators by Output (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "3 \ndirections of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19; (ii) to support \nthe field level monitoring of vaccination sites and cold chain points; (iii) to carry out dynamic \nanalysis of data disaggregated by gender (men; women and others), rural and urban and priority \ngroups from digital platforms to inform decision making;8 and (iv) assist the government to compile \nand reflect the lessons from the COVID-19 vaccination, including gender equality and social \ninclusion aspects, for future pandemic response or national vaccination programs.  \n \n8.  Output 2: Private sector engagement in COVID-19 vaccination supported.  This \noutput would focus on enhanced engagement and capacity building of private sector vaccination \nservice providers for adherence to the COVID-19 Vaccines Operational Guidelines issued by the \nMOHFW. The Government of India has roped in more than 6,000 private health facilities have \nbeen providing COVID-19 vaccination. Under the new strategy of extending vaccination to \npopulation aged 18 years or above, engagement of private health facilities is likely to increase. \nPrivate health sector in India is mostly focused on curative care and has limited experience with \nuniversal vaccination; moreover, they will be administering different formulations of COVID-19 \nvaccines including imported products. Since different COVID-19 vaccines vary in their storage \nrequirements, dosage schedules, and routes of administration, hence engagement and capacity \nbuilding of private sector service providers are important to ensure safe and effective vaccination. \n \n9.  Output  3:  Management  and  safe  disposal  of  immunization  waste  improved. \nIncreased BMW from COVID-19 response including those from vaccination sites would strain the \nexisting treatment capacity in some states and the capacity of the related workforce in dealing \nwith these. This output aims to strengthen monitoring of BMW management through field level \nmonitors of vaccination sites and in improving the tracking of the disposal process and record \nkeeping. This output will also (i) develop standard operating procedures and various information \nmaterials for dissemination;9 (ii) support capacity building of over 2,000 healthcare and frontline \nworkers (40% women) and 200 civil society organizations and nongovernment organizations;10 \nas well as (iii) develop guidance on improved BMW disposal practices such as deep burial or \nincineration. This output will be further enhanced by demonstrating best practice examples \nthrough hand-holding support in 10 vaccination centres in three selected states including Delhi, \nRajasthan, and Tamil Nadu. Findings would be shared widely through webinars for possible \nscaling up and adoption across other states. Together, these activities would help sustain focus \non BMW management including driving policy level discussions.   \n \n10.  Output 4: Adequate oxygen supply for severe COVID-19 cases in selected health \nfacilities provided. This output will provide oxygen and related supplies to help manage COVID-\n19 positive patient load. The COVID-19 care facilities are facing a high burden with shortages of \noxygen supply, which is critical in reducing COVID-19 mortality. Because the needs at the facility \nlevel are rapidly shifting, the decisions on oxygen and equipment allocations will be dynamic, \nkeeping in mind the caseload trend in the identified catchment areas and previous equipment \nsupplied. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is already supporting a medical oxygen PMU as \npart of its capacity building support to the MOHFW.11 The PMU has undertaken district-wise \noxygen storage inventory mapping of the states and is continuously working on an allocation and \ndistribution plan in real time given the shifting needs. The equipment will remain useful after the \n \n8  PMU will draw on the field level monitoring carried out by WHO and other partners in carrying out such analysis.  \n9  Communication tools would be developed including infographics, posters, and short videos in local languages. \n10 Mediums of training would include on-line, classroom and onsite training. Target group would include administrators \nand health care managers; medical, paramedical, cleaners and waste handlers in health facilities; and training of \ntrainers. Staff from common biomedical waste treatment facilities may be included in the training in coordination with \nthe state pollution control authorities.  \n11 ADB. 2020.

This output \nwill also include capacity building to further strengthen immediate response activities. \n \n11.  Output 5: Awareness of COVID-19 and vaccination program among disadvantaged \ngroups increased. This output will increase visibility on COVID-19 appropriate behaviors and \ninformation on vaccination around vaccination centers and catchment areas (rural).  It will also \nenhance risk communications and community engagement outreach, especially targeting the \npoor, women, older people, persons with disabilities, residents in rural and remote areas, and \nother disadvantaged minority groups, through various networks and platforms, including women\u2019s \ngroups in rural areas, community-based frontline workers (incl. anganwadi and social health \nactivist workers) appointed under the Integrated Child Development Services program of the \nMinistry of Women and Child Development. The TA will also establish partnerships with rural \nbanking networks, and new types of civil society organizations as an innovative pathways to reach \nout larger underserved population. This activity will target at least 20 partners, networks, or \nplatforms.  Monitoring  of  proposed  interventions  would  be  constantly  undertaken  to  assess \neffectiveness and improvement in vaccine uptake. Further details including indicative locations \nare provided in the terms of reference.12  \n \n12.  Output 6: Cold chain capacity for COVID-19 vaccination in rural and remote areas \nwith limited electricity enhanced. Rural and remote areas face constraints in stable supply of \nelectricity with at least 10% of villages not yet connected to the grid as of 2019. COVID-19 \nvaccines have stringent requirements for cold chain temperatures and disruptions in power supply \ncould result in vaccine wastage. The TA will provide around 50 pieces of solar direct drive combo \nvaccine storage equipment13 for health facilities or vaccination sites in rural or remote areas.14 \nThe equipment will benefit not only COVID-19 vaccine beneficiaries but will also benefit children \nand pregnant women for routine vaccinations and will continuously support vaccination and \nprimary health care service provision in rural and remote areas. Further, the output will also focus \non capacity building of health care workers and cold chain handlers (at least 50% women) in the \nuse  and  maintenance  of  the  new  equipment  through  trainings  and  operational  manual \ndevelopment. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $7,000,000, of which (i) $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other Sources) and (ii) $5,000,000 will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. \nThe key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. Outputs 1, 2, and 3 will be financed by TASF \nwhile Output 4, 5, and 6 will be financed by JFPR.15 The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, coordination support, and other in-kind contributions.

The activities under \noutput 2 will be carried in states selected from Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, \nMadhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. \n13 The solarization of primary healthcare facilities will include 3 states with one state each from (i) North Eastern states; \n(ii) tribal states (Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, or Chhattisgarh); and (iii) high population states (Maharashtra, Odisha, \nGujarat, Jharkhand, or West Bengal). In addition, tentatively, 50 primary healthcare facilities across the North Eastern \nstates will benefit from the solar powered equipment. \n14 The 50 solar direct drives will contribute to an approximate reduction of 24,000 to 28,000 kg of CO2 emissions per \nyear as compared to the average CO2 emissions of the existing cold chain equipment. The figure represents the \nindirect CO2 emissions based on electricity use during operations converted to emissions quantity using country \nspecific emission factors. \n15 Including climate change financing estimated as around $465,000. \n ", "5 \ngovernment was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing \nproject. \n \nD.
