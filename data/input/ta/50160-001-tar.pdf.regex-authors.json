INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific, an annual flagship publication of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), provides (i) the latest comprehensive compendium and analysis of \ntrends in economic, social, financial, and environmental indicators\u2014including those pertaining to \nthe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\u2014for ADB\u2019s regional members; (ii) a unique set of \nreliable and accurate statistics on global value chains (GVCs) that capture trade links across \ncountries and industries while accounting for the complex input\u2013output relationships involved in \nproducing goods and services; and (iii) a special chapter that provides in-depth, data-intensive \nanalysis of an important policy issue. In addition to disseminating its statistics through print and \ndigital media, ADB\u2019s statistical database system (SDBS)\u2014the associated online database of the \nKey Indicators\u2014enables users to access and analyze statistics on economic and social themes. \nThe statistics portal, a related online resource accessible to ADB staff, disseminates information \non data resources available in ADB and offers links to non-ADB data resources. \n2.  The Key Indicators provides a data and information support system that can be used for \nevidence-based  policy  making.1 Its  production  has  been  supported  regularly  by  technical \nassistance (TA) funding. The objectives, scope, and activities to be covered by the TA are in the \ndesign and monitoring framework (Appendix 1).2 \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The TA is designed to address development issues from two perspectives: (i) informing \npolicy  discussions  on  inclusive  growth  through  rigorous  empirical  analyses  of  survey  and \nadministrative data; and (ii) disseminating official statistics of the developing member countries \n(DMCs), other economic and social indicators, and survey data sets in an integrated format and \nthrough both print and digital media as well as through online databases. \n4.  While  the  region  has  experienced  rapid  economic  growth,  there  is  widespread \nacknowledgment that growth could be made more inclusive. This indicates a need to rigorously \nassess and build evidence on the types of policy and institutional frameworks needed for more \ninclusive  development.  Given  ADB\u2019s  strategic  agenda  of  promoting  inclusive  growth  and \nmanaging for development results, the TA will support high-quality microeconomic research \nalong five pipelines: (i) poverty, inequality, and labor markets; (ii) human capital development, \nincluding education and health; (iii) firm competitiveness, including entrepreneurship and small \nand medium-sized enterprises; (iv) infrastructure and urbanization; and (v) GVCs and trade. \nBuilding up these five research pipelines will leverage existing skills of staff economists, develop \ncritical research capacity, and enable the production of quality rigorous research over the longer \nterm that can make greater contributions to the policy sphere. Deviations from these pipelines \nwill only occur upon the hiring of new staff that can capably deliver quality research in new \nareas. These pipelines will feed directly into the Key Indicators theme chapter and additional \nreports. The topics for a given year will be decided in consultation with higher management and \nkey sector groups, but are mandated to fall within these five areas of work. \n5.  Evidence-based decision-making relies on being able to easily access credible statistics \nand data sets for informing cross-country and within-country analyses on a wide variety of topics, \nincluding those pertaining to SDGs as well as trade links across countries. \n                                                \n1  The Key Indicators is consistently among the top downloaded ADB publications during 2011\u20132015. \n2  The vice-president for knowledge management and sustainable development approved the concept clearance on \n24 May 2016. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 June 2016. \n ", "2   \n6.  The special chapters and statistics sections of the Key Indicators involve recurring data \nand research work that are often linked across editions. The work on the special chapters will be \ncarried out on a multiyear cycle to allow for (i) wider stakeholder consultations at various stages \nof  the  production  and dissemination  cycle;  (ii)  more  rigorous  analysis,  including  scope for \nconducting  primary  surveys  for  data  collection;  and  (iii)  timely  engagement  of  experts, \nconsultants,  and  academic  and  research  institutions.  To  support  the  multiyear  cycle  and \nundertake  recurring  data  and  research  work  efficiently,  the  TA  will  need  a  multiyear \nimplementation period with a broadly defined scope and terms of reference to provide flexibility \nin refining each subproject. These factors suggest that a TA cluster approach is suitable. \n7.  Since both the research and statistics portions of the Key Indicators are critical for \nunderstanding inclusive growth and developing evidence-based policies in the region, the Key \nIndicators was identified as a corporate priority during the TA resource allocation meeting. \nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be enhanced evidence-based policy making, investment decisions, and \nproject design in ADB\u2019s DMCs. The outcome will be the sustained use of Key Indicators data \nand analysis by DMC officials, economic researchers, civil society, and other users. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n1.  Cluster Technical Assistance \n9.  The cluster TA will comprise three chronologically sequenced subprojects encompassing \nthe annual production of the 2018\u20132020 reports. The TA will support the (i) preparation of \nbackground research papers; (ii) continued data collection from national, international, and ADB \nsources plus modernization of ADB database systems such as the SDBS; (iii) publication of the \nKey Indicators (print and online versions), including the production of statistical tables for SDGs, \ncountry and regional trends, GVCs, and special chapters; and (iv) workshops for knowledge \nsharing and dissemination of key results and policy recommendations. Background research \npapers will be published through appropriate vehicles to maximize the dissemination and impact \nof the analyses conducted, e.g., policy briefs, journal publications, edited volumes, and/or as \nspecial supplements to the Key Indicators. \n10.  Candidate  topics  for  the  special  chapters  will  draw  from  one  of  the  five  research \npipelines that leverage existing economist staff expertise or focus on data measurement issues \nrelevant to public policy research that fit the expertise of the statisticians. \n11.  The TA will support additional survey work and reports related to the five research \npipelines to build up strategic capabilities in sectors that generate considerable knowledge \nreturns. These will be published as stand-alone reports or background papers. To ensure that \nthe  research  pipelines  address  inclusive  policy  development  in  the  region,  feasibility \nassessments and consultations will be used to identify unanswered policy questions and lay out \napproaches to respond to these questions. \n12.  The TA will continue to support innovative statistics-related work on GVC indicators \n(initiated in the Key Indicators 2015) because of their importance in understanding the benefits \nof  trade  for  the  region\u2019s  entrepreneurs  and  workers.  The  Development  Economics  and \n ", "  3 \nIndicators Division (ERDI) pioneered the production of original indicators to quantify and analyze \nthe phenomenon of international production sharing in a globalized economy. While measuring \nthe scale and structure of GVCs is a highly complicated task, ERDI has implemented new \nmethods that provide a powerful framework for measurement. Building on these developments, \nthe  TA  will  help  selected  DMCs  produce  data  for  more  credible  measurement  and  policy \nanalysis on GVC issues. \n13.  The Key Indicators will be widely disseminated to its target audience in coordination with \nADB\u2019s Department of External Relations. Dissemination will start with an international media \nlaunch  followed  by  seminar  presentations  to  key  government  officials,  business  people, \nacademia, and other research groups. The Key Indicators will be uploaded to the ADB website \nand disseminated through social media. Background papers will be published separately in \nADB\u2019s working paper series, the Asian Development Review, or other media at a later date. \n2.  Subproject 1 \n14.  Subproject 1 will cover the 2018 report. In addition to the country, regional, SDG, and \nGVC  tables,  the  2018  report  will  feature  a  special  chapter  on  urbanization.  The  World \nUrbanization Prospects 2014 reports that 90% of the projected urban growth between now and \n2050 will be concentrated in cities in the developing world (Asia and Africa).3 While conventional \nwisdom  tells  us  that  opportunity  comes  with  urbanization  and  that  cities  are  engines  of \naggregate economic growth, recent studies suggest that urbanization in developing countries \ndoes not necessarily lead to quality jobs or formalization of the labor market. In fact, the \ncorrelation between rates of urbanization and economic growth was shown to be weaker in \ndeveloping countries. Thus, understanding what policy-amenable factors enable urban areas to \ncreate quality jobs is an urgent priority. Tentatively titled \u201cFuture of Asian Cities: Urbanization \nand Jobs,\u201d the 2018 report will focus on the city\u2019s role as the traditional engine of growth and as \nan important locus for policy making to create more and better jobs. A profile of Asian cities with \nrespect to their size and geography, mode of formation, and governance and regulation will be \npresented  to  examine  how  structures  of  production  and  employment  differ  across  cities. \nSubproject 1 will also investigate how employment opportunities and enterprise formation and \ngrowth are largely affected by policies on land use regulations and city governments\u2019 planning \nand financing of urban infrastructure. Case studies will be carried out in selected cities (e.g., \nunderstanding the role of economic and/or industrial zones in providing quality jobs). Results of \nthe studies will inform policy makers in Asia and the Pacific on the most efficient and sound \nurban policies and institutions to be adopted to attain inclusive growth. \n3.  Subproject 2 and Subproject 3 \n15.  Subprojects 2 and 3 will be structured along the lines of subproject 1 and cover the \nproduction of the 2019 and 2020 reports. The reports will continue to provide a compendium \nand analysis of trends in economic, social, financial, and environmental indicators of ADB\u2019s \nregional members. \n16.  Subsequent  themes  will  likely  focus  on  entrepreneurship,  technological  innovation, \ninformation and communication technology, jobs, and measurement-oriented topics relating to \ninfrastructure development. Consultations and discussions with regional departments and sector \n                                                \n3  United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. 2014.

Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $3,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V for subproject 1; subsequent subprojects to \nbe financed by the succeeding TASF replenishment). The cost estimates and financing plan is \nin Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the executing agency, while ERDI will be the implementing division. ERDI \nwill coordinate with other ADB units (regional and other departments, resident missions, and \nsector and thematic groups) and statistical partners in ADB regional members in undertaking \nthe TA activities. The TA will be implemented over 64 months, beginning 1 September 2016 \nuntil its targeted completion on 31 December 2021. \n19.  Each TA subproject will be approved by the chief economist and director general of the \nEconomic Research and Regional Cooperation Department in accordance with the Operations \nManual section on TA.4 Approval will be sought through a memorandum outlining (i) the overall \nprogress of the cluster TA to date, (ii) outcome and intended outputs of the TA subproject, \n(iii) cost estimates and budget, (iv) implementation arrangements, (v) implementation schedule, \n(vi)  terms  of  reference  for  consultants,  and  (vii)  other  aspects  as  appropriate.  Each  TA \nsubproject  will  require  a  draft  design  and  monitoring  framework  and  will  be  subject  to \nconsultations with departments and/or other offices concerned before submission to the chief \neconomist and director general for approval. \n20.  The  Key  Indicators  is  produced  by  a  team  of  ERDI  international,  national,  and \nadministrative  staff  with  significant  inputs  from  international  and  national  consultants.  An \nestimated 72 person-months of international consultancy services and 501 person-months of \nnational consultancy services will be needed for the cluster TA, i.e., production processes for \nthe special chapters, statistical tables (country, SDG,5 and regional tables; GVC indicators), \nspecial pilot indicators and data sets, the statistics portal and SDBS, and development activities \nrelated to improving data quality and promoting effective dissemination of results and findings. \n21.  For  the  special  chapters,  the  international  consultants  (economists  and  manuscript \neditors)  will  (i)  engage  in  economic  analysis  and  write  the  theme  chapter,  (ii)  prepare \nbackground reports and original research related to the theme, and (iii) conduct manuscript and \neconomics editing. The national consultants (economists or statisticians or data specialists) will \nassist  in  (i)  data  gathering,  data  cleaning,  and  updating  indicators;  (ii)  conducting  further \nresearch on the indicators; (iii) laying out text and tables; and (iv) manuscript and/or copyediting. \nSurveys may be conducted in selected DMCs as deemed necessary to improve the relevance \nand originality of the analysis. \n22.  For the statistical portion, international consultants (writers) will be engaged to draft \nnarratives on trends in the region as evidenced by statistical indicators. The national consultants \n(economics and statistics specialists and graphic designers) will assist in (i) preparing statistical \ntables and commentaries, (ii) laying out text and tables, and (iii) manuscript and/or copyediting. \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2013.

International  (economists)  and  national  (research  associates  and  economists) \nconsultants will also be engaged to prepare the GVC section and develop new indicators on \nfuture topic(s) of importance to economic policy making. \n24.  To improve ADB\u2019s statistics portal, SDBS, and other data systems, national consultants \n(data  analysts)  will  (i)  conduct  a  comprehensive  cleaning,  review,  and  assessment  of  the \nexisting data, databases, data sources, and newly procured additional data sets; (ii) develop a \nsystem  modernization  plan;  and  (iii)  produce  additional  functionalities  and  changes  in  the \nstatistics portal as indicated in the plan. All data sets such as basic statistics, other external \ndatabases, household survey data sets, and tools that can be integrated into the statistics portal \nwill also be brought in. The TA will engage a reputable information technology company through \nthe consultants\u2019 qualification selection method to update and enhance AsiaData (Key Indicators \nmobile application), which will function for both Android and Apple handheld devices. \n25.  Resource  persons  will  be  engaged  for  workshops  and  training  events,  e.g.,  Key \nIndicators workshops for the special chapters, training on a theme of interest, and subregional \nworkshops for the statistical tables. Travel of ADB staff participating as resource persons may \nbe supported in accordance with the appropriate administrative guidelines. \n26.  An  edited  volume  or  book  will  be  published  during the  3-year  cycle  based  on the \nresearch conducted for Key Indicators special chapters. A globally reputable economic research \ninstitution with strong in-house expertise and research capacity in development economics will \nbe engaged through the fixed budget selection method to produce the book or volume using \nbackground  papers  prepared  for  the  special  chapters  and  original  research  studies  to  be \nconducted by the firm or institution. \n27.  The outline terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 3. Consultants will be \nengaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). Disbursements will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Procurement of equipment will \nfollow  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Equipment \npurchased will comply with ADB guidelines on accountability of assets purchased under the TA, \nand disposal will follow the procedures in the relevant project administration instructions. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n28.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $3,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor the Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2018\u20132020, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nEnhanced evidence-based policy making, investment decisions, and project design in ADB\u2019s DMCs. \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting   Risks \nOutcome  By 2020:     \nSustained use of  a.
