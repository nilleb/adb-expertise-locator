I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsenior loan of $50,000,000 to AccessBank Azerbaijan (ABA) for Promoting Rural Financial \nInclusion in Azerbaijan.1 \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n2.  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, exposure to macroeconomic shocks and financial \ncrises has undermined public confidence in Azerbaijan\u2019s banking system. Private credit to gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  has  averaged  16%  since  2008,  indicating  a  depth  of  financial \nintermediation far below other middle-income peers.2 Access to financial services is low in \nAzerbaijan, and is highly concentrated in the capital (Baku) where 88% of bank lending is \nextended. Azerbaijan\u2019s regions,3 which account for 78% of the population, lag far behind the \ncapital in access to finance, receiving only 12% of bank lending.4 Compared with emerging \nmarkets in Eastern Europe, the efficiency and stability of financial intermediation are low, as \nwitnessed by high lending\u2013deposit rate spreads and high default in 2008 and 2009. Supporting \noutreach of financial services to the regions and improving stability of the finance sector will \nhave major qualitative impacts on the economy and people by stimulating rural income and \nemployment.  This  will  also  support  critical  risk  and  income  diversification  away  from  the \ndominant and volatile energy sector. \n \n3.  Although rural economic activity contributes less than 10% to GDP, it supports 75% of \nthe population and 38% of employment. The quality of growth is particularly significant in rural \nareas, as it provides major benefits for low-income families and stimulates demand for goods \nand  services  produced  by  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs),  which \nrepresent the bulk of activities in secondary towns and rural districts.5 The government has \nrecognized that it needs to stimulate value additive activities outside the oil and gas sector, \nparticularly in the regions. Stimulating economic activity and income generation in the regions \nhas  become  a  government  priority,  and  it  is  pursuing  rural  investments  in  infrastructure, \nagriculture, and agribusiness.6 \n \n4.  MSMEs in Azerbaijan are a critical contributor to income and employment with 42% of \nthe labor force being employed by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and many more \nindividuals operating as micro-entrepreneurs. However, MSMEs and farmers have consistently \nlacked access to finance because traditional security-based lending practices have not been \nable  to  accommodate  the  informal  information  available  or  address  the  lack  of  available \ncollateral. The senior loan to ABA, Azerbaijan\u2019s market leader in MSME finance with a strong \nand growing footprint in the regions, supports access to business finance in the regions by \nextending funding for onlending to MSMEs that focus their business in areas outside the capital. \n \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  World Bank. 2012. Benchmarking Financial Systems around the World, Country Comparisons. Washington, DC.  \n3  In this report, \u201cregions\u201d refers to areas outside the capital city Baku. \n4  Central Bank of Azerbaijan, Monthly Bulletin. December 2012.  \n5  Most Azerbaijani enterprises range in the micro and small size category. Only a few are medium-sized, according \nto the European Union threshold for large enterprises above 250 employees and business turnover of greater than \nAZN50 million equivalent. Azerbaijan is part of the European Union neighborhood region. \n6  The key elements of the government\u2019s strategy were presented during the Azerbaijan 2020: The Vision of the \nFuture conference held on 3 December 2012 in Baku under the auspices of the President of Azerbaijan. \n ", "2   \n5.  In 2005, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided a nonsovereign loan of $4 million \nto ABA for onlending, predominantly to microenterprises.7 ABA has fully repaid this loan, which \nADB rated successful.8 ABA is also a participant in ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program. In June \n2012, ADB entered into discussions with ABA\u2019s senior management to broaden the existing \nrelationship, and designed a loan targeted to support MSMEs in the country\u2019s regions. The \nproposed loan aims to build on the success of the first intervention with ABA and strengthen its \ncontribution to rural financial inclusion, providing finance to private farms and businesses in \nregional towns and villages. ABA currently conducts half of its lending business in the regions \nand is therefore considered a good candidate for ADB funding given its existing footprint in the \nregions and its rural staffing and branch expansion plans. This will strengthen ABA\u2019s regional \nplatform to target and service MSMEs.  \n \n6.  ABA  was  established  as  a  greenfield  bank  serving  low-income  customers.  Access \nMicrofinance  Holding  Aktiengesellschaft  (AMH),  one  of  ABA\u2019s  core  shareholders,  has \nsuccessfully tested this business model in a number of low and lower-middle income economies \nin Central Asia and Africa. ABA\u2019s international financial institution (IFI) investors share a long- \nterm vision of building a strong profitable bank, and exercise influence in promoting internal and \nexternal governance best practices. High-quality selection and training of staff and management, \nstrong internal rules for integrity and responsibility toward their customers, no tolerance for \nabuse, and resources to handle crises that may adversely affect a greenfield bank in its buildup \nperiod are the essential components of their successful greenfield bank business model.  \n \n7.  ABA has set high governance standards in Azerbaijan\u2019s banking industry, driven by the \nquality and principles of its shareholders, strong board oversight, and outstanding asset quality \nand client responsiveness. With a Fitch rating of BB+, it is the best internationally rated bank in \nAzerbaijan. ABA received three consecutive Euromoney awards from 2010 to 2012 as the best \nbank in Azerbaijan. The Consultative Group to Assist the Poor\u2019s Smart Campaign evaluation in \n2011 rated ABA outstanding for fairness and responsibility with its customers. The proposed \nloan will improve rural financial inclusion in Azerbaijan, and provide ADB with entry into a \nrelationship with AMH to promote financial inclusion in other challenging developing member \ncountry markets where it has a presence, including Tajikistan and potentially Myanmar in the \nfuture. \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n8.  ABA, the eighth largest bank in Azerbaijan, had assets of AZN515 million ($656 million) \nand a market share of 3.3% of loans and 2.2% of deposits at FYE2012. It has a strong franchise \namong MSMEs, which represent 91% of total loans and a moderate exposure to retail clients \n(9% of loans), which includes mortgages and staff loans. Its unique strength lies in its capability \nto  analyze  undocumented  business  cash  flows  and  provide  loans  to  very  small  business \ncustomers through its branch and loan officer network, hence filling the market gap where \ntraditional lenders are not active. Originally focused on Baku, ABA has diversified its portfolio by \nexpanding  its  loan  book  in  the  regions,  thereby  reducing  the  concentration  risk  to  the \nincreasingly  competitive  Baku  market.  Regional  loans  now  represent  50%  of  total  loans. \nMoreover, ABA plans to strengthen services to MSMEs outside Baku through an additional  \n18 regional branches by the end of 2017, and grow its regional loan book to 55% of total loans. \nABA\u2019s loan book increased by 34% in 2012, and the first 4 months of 2013 indicate 30% growth \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Assistance to \nPrivate Banks and Leasing Companies in Azerbaijan. Manila. \n8  ADB. 2011. Extended Annual Review Report: Private Banks and Leasing Companies in Azerbaijan. Manila. \n ", "        3 \nby FYE2013. Growth in the immediate term is being supported through the establishment of \nnine additional regional branches during 2013, and the significant opportunities offered by a \nsubstantially underserved MSME segment.  \n \n9.  ABA\u2019s gross loan portfolio (GLP) reached AZN414 million ($525 million) at FYE2012. \nABA recently revised its GLP growth target downward to a compound annual growth rate \n(CAGR) of 13% from 2013 to 2017, based on the anticipated recapitalization of banks. The \nCentral  Bank  of  Azerbaijan  (CBAR)  increased  the  minimum  capital  requirement  from  \nAZN10 million to AZN50 million by FYE2013. Competition in banking is expected to intensify, \nresulting in a more conservative growth trajectory. However, ABA is expected to increase the \ncredit it provides to regional MSMEs at a CAGR of 15% and double by FYE2017, equivalent to \nan increase of $256 million.  \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n10.  Ownership.  Established  in  2002  as  a  greenfield  microfinance  bank,  ABA  is \npredominantly owned by IFIs, with Black Sea Trade and Development Bank, the European \nBank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), \nand KfW each holding 20% of shares. AMH holds 16.5% of shares and Luso Financial Systems \nholds the remaining 3.5%.  \n \n11.  Management. ABA\u2019s board of management (BOM) is chaired by the chief executive \nofficer, and has four additional members: director of finance, director of business banking and \nrisk, director of retail banking and operations, and director of infrastructure. The chief executive \nofficer, a German commercial banker with 17 years of experience in Europe and the Russian \nFederation, joined ABA in mid-2012. All other members of the BOM are Azerbaijani nationals, \nhave strong academic backgrounds, and most have been with ABA since its establishment in \n2002. Three members have moved up from credit officers to their current positions and are \nintimately familiar with ABA operations. The BOM sets strategic targets for approval by the \nboard of directors (BOD).  \n \n12.  Governance Structure. ABA is governed by a two-tier board structure comprising the \nBOD and the BOM. The BOD is responsible for overseeing implementation of key policies, \napproving strategic plans and business targets, and appointing management and monitoring \ntheir performance. Black Sea Trade and Development Bank, EBRD, IFC, and KfW nominate \nfour  of  the  five  BOD  members  (including  the  chairperson),  who  are  currently  all  senior \nprofessionals with international banking experience. The other board member is a German \nbanker, who was ABA\u2019s CEO from 2002 to 2006. He was nominated by AMH. Two of the five \ncurrent BOD members are women. \n \n13.  ABA\u2019s  audit  department  reports  directly  to  the  audit  committee  and  is  led  by  an \nexperienced auditor. The external auditor changes periodically. PricewaterhouseCoopers has \nconducted audits since 2009. Historically, audit observations have related to addressing fraud \nidentified at branches. To reduce fraud risk and meet the requirements of its growing business, \nABA is currently migrating from its legacy banking software to a more advanced core banking \nsystem  (Temenos  24),  which  is  scheduled  to  be  operational  in  September  2014.  Audit \nobservations have not identified any major accounting, operating, or compliance risks. ABA \ndismisses staff if fraud is identified and substantiated. In the view of the audit department, ABA \nmanagement addresses audit issues in a timely manner. ABA\u2019s audit function is considered to \nbe well established. ", "4   \n14.  The  finance  and  audit  departments  manage  reporting  on  money  laundering.  ABA \nidentifies  suspicious  transactions  by  scanning  information  by  source  of  wealth,  politically \nexposed  persons,  and  watch  lists.  It  has  established  \u201cknow  your  customer\u201d  and  policies \ncountering money laundering, and reports findings to the CBAR Financial Services Unit.9 \nD.  Financial Performance \n15.  Capital  adequacy.  ABA\u2019s  total  capital  adequacy  (under  both  Basel  I  International \nFinancial Reporting Standards [IFRS] and Azerbaijan regulatory definitions) has well exceeded \nminimum requirements or benchmarks. Throughout the 2008\u20132009 banking crisis, ABA\u2019s capital \nadequacy was supported by a no dividend policy (until 2009) and a 3-year income tax holiday \nfor  all  banks  in  Azerbaijan,  which  ended  in  2011,  allowing  a  buildup  of  capital  through \naccumulation  of  retained  earnings.  As  a  result,  ABA\u2019s  Basel  I  capital  adequacy  ratio  was \nmaintained at 22.5% or greater from 2008 to 2012, despite ABA\u2019s significant loan growth and \ndividend payout in FY2012. This comfortable capital position should provide a cushion for \nadditional capital charges for market and operating risk, once CBAR decides to move toward \nBasel II and III regulatory frameworks.  \n16.  Asset quality. ABA maintained high asset quality throughout the high growth period due \nto its rigorous client selection and monitoring process, the high granularity of its loan portfolio, \nand the substantial proportion of repeat loans (representing 76% of its GLP at FYE2012).10 The \nmicro, agriculture, SME, mortgage, and consumer loan segments have consistently shown a \nhigh portfolio quality with nonperforming loans (NPLs) not exceeding AZN4.8 million (or 1.1% of \nGLP) throughout 2012.11 Since 2007, the NPL ratio has never exceeded 1.4% of GLP, whereas \nthe Azerbaijan banking system has historically recorded an NPL ratio of 6%\u201310%. ABA has \nimplemented  a  conservative  provisioning  policy,  with  provisions  exceeding  portfolio  at  risk \ngreater than 30 days by 2.5 to 3.0 times since 2007. The good sector diversification supports \nthe robustness of asset quality, and single and related party exposures are kept at policy levels \nfar below the CBAR prudential minimum.12  \n17.  Earnings. For FY2012, net income dropped slightly to AZN15.8 million ($20.1 million), \nfrom AZN17.3 million ($22.1 million) in FY2011, as a result of increasing competition in Baku \nand the end of the tax holiday for banks. However, return on equity remained sound at 17.6% \nand return on assets at 3.5%. Net income grew at a CAGR of 35% from 2007 to 2012 and \nreturn on equity remained above 35% during 2008\u20132010, primarily the result of high business \ngrowth and the income tax holiday in place from 2009 to 2011. After the 2009 financial crisis, \nABA\u2019s net interest margin dropped by about 250 basis points to 19% by FYE2011, before \nrecovering by 70 basis points in FY2012. ABA\u2019s net interest margin is strong by international \nstandards and appropriate given a high cost-to-income ratio, which reached 69.3% in 2012 due \nto ABA\u2019s personal, intensive, low transaction volume business model. For the coming years, the \nreturn on assets is projected to moderate but remain above 2%, reflecting cost increases for the \nbranch expansion and tightening of net interest margin. ABA expects its net profit to grow by 3% \n                                                 \n9  Azerbaijan participates in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Its compliance is monitored by MONEYVAL, \nCouncil of Europe Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures and the Financing \nof Terrorism. \n10 High granularity of a loan portfolio refers to a portfolio that is well diversified across a large number of borrowers \nwith small individual exposures. \n11 In this report, NPLs are defined in line with ADB\u2019s problem loan definition, which is the sum of (i) not impaired loans \noverdue more than 90 days, (ii) loans classified impaired according to the International Financial Reporting \nStandards, and (iii) restructured loans within 12 months of the reporting date and not included in (i) and/or (ii). \n12 CBAR prescribes single party exposure limits at 7% of regulatory capital for unsecured and 20% for secured \nexposures, and related party exposures to legal entities at 10% of total regulatory capital and to individuals at 3%.  ", "        5 \nannually to the end of 2017 through efficiency gains, while continuing to maintain high portfolio \nquality, despite the increase in costs associated with regional expansion. \n \n18.  Liquidity and asset\u2013liability management. Since 2008, ABA has improved its local \nfunding base. Approximately half of its deposits constitute accounts that exceed AZN150,000, \nand are held by individuals and institutions that tend to be price sensitive. The share of deposits \nto total funding improved from 14% in 2008 to 49% in 2011. However, in 2012 the ratio dropped \nto 42% as a result of strong loan growth and an increase in longer-term borrowing from IFIs. \nImproving the deposit base through cross selling to its MSME customers will be important to \nprovide more stable domestic funding. ABA has a particular strength in mobilizing direct and \nindirect  (through  MSME  investment  funds)  IFI  funding  (including  its  shareholders),  and \ncommercially  oriented  bilateral  and  philanthropic  investor  funding,  given  its  attractive \ndevelopment-oriented  business  model.  However,  additional  financial  support  from  current \nshareholders and lenders is constrained by single investment and borrower exposure limits at \nthe respective IFIs. Access to other commercial funding remains limited, as a result of the \ncollapse of funding from European commercial sources since the global financial crisis and the \nongoing sovereign debt crisis in Europe. ABA\u2019s domestic wholesale funding is insignificant, and \nthe bank has no access to government-subsidized funding programs. However, this has the \nbenefit of ensuring that ABA does not come under political pressure with respect to its lending \nactivities. Until FYE2013, ABA expects loan growth to exceed deposit growth and then to \nslightly reverse, targeting a share of deposits to total liabilities of 50% by FYE2017.  \n19.  Sensitivity to market risk. All banks in Azerbaijan are exposed to market risk arising \nfrom the direct foreign currency exposure of their funding. Since 2009, ABA has improved its \n(unhedged) balance sheet foreign currency gap from 69% to 51% of total regulatory capital. \nSince most deposits and all IFI borrowings are denominated in foreign currency, ABA matches \nits foreign currency resources with foreign currency lending. It manages the foreign currency- \ninduced credit risk through a requirement that borrower cash flows need to be twice as high as \nfor local currency denominated loans to ensure debt service capacity under adverse scenarios. \nIn  addition,  term  loans  are  largely  assigned  to  mortgage  and  business  loans  with  foreign \ncurrency income. In the absence of a liquid swap market, the capital buffer and cautionary debt \nservice arrangements appear appropriate to manage foreign currency-induced credit risk. ABA\u2019s \ninterest rate sensitivity, measured by the earlier of contractual repricing or maturity dates, \nindicates that the gap for below 6-month maturity has substantially reduced since 2011. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n20.  The proposed ADB assistance comprises a senior, unsecured loan facility of up to  \n$50 million with a tenor of 5 years. The proceeds will be used exclusively to support ABA\u2019s plan \nto increase lending to MSMEs in the underserved regions outside Baku, including secondary \ntowns and rural districts. The assistance will also provide enhanced access to longer-term \nfinance for the MSME segment,  which is critical to support income and employment.13  \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  ABA will be required to provide annual audited financial statements in accordance with \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards. It will also provide quarterly financial statements \n                                                 \n13 In this loan, MSMEs are enterprises employing up to 250 staff and reaching an annual business turnover of up to \nAZN50 million, in line with the definition of the European Union. Subloans will not exceed $3 million equivalent. ", "6   \nand compliance certificates for agreed covenants. Reporting requirements include (i) status \nupdates  for  introducing  and  maintaining  the  Basel  regulatory  framework;  (ii)  updates  on \ngovernance, safeguards, and social protection compliance; and (iii) updates on ABA\u2019s business \nperformance and utilization of the ADB loan. ADB will field review missions at least annually to \nreview and discuss progress with ABA management. \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n22.  ADB\u2019s value addition to the project is expected to be the following: \n(i)  ADB will provide stable long-term financing that currently cannot be raised from \nthe local market. Azerbaijan\u2019s capital markets are nascent, and public confidence \nin the finance sector is only gradually being restored. Commercial bank funding is \nnot readily available given current market conditions in Europe. IFIs that are \nfunding Azerbaijan banks are now operating within tighter country, sector, and \nsingle investment and borrower exposure limits, thereby increasing the need for \nADB engagement. More broadly, the loan may contribute to increasing public \nconfidence in the banking system, through the support of this strong and growing \nbank with significant outreach in underserved areas. \n(ii)  The  loan  will  improve  financial  inclusion,  specifically  by  targeting  MSMEs  in \nregions, including rural areas. Secondary towns play an important role as trade \nand service hubs linking agriculture to national and regional markets. MSMEs \nhave not been well served by the traditional banking system, and ABA has \ndeveloped specialized lending practices to reach these underserved customers. \nThe ADB loan will support diversification in the regions outside Baku and to non-\noil subsectors.  \n(iii)  Through close on-site monitoring and dialogue with ABA management, ADB will \nsupport ABA\u2019s adherence to high corporate governance, social, environmental, \nand fiduciary standards; and enhance risk management. \nD.  Risks \n23.  Challenging  operational  environment.  The  global  economic  downturn  negatively \naffected the Azerbaijan economy, as evidenced by the decline in oil and gas demand and the \nassociated sharp decline in GDP growth. For banking, depositor confidence further weakened \nas shown by the sector-wide loan to deposit ratio of 144% as of FYE2011, loan growth slowed, \nand asset quality deteriorated. Notwithstanding the current period of economic growth, the small \ndomestic economy has a narrow non-oil base, is highly concentrated in Baku, and remains \nsusceptible to deteriorations in the operating environment, which could adversely affect loan \nportfolio quality and capital adequacy. In response, ABA seeks to diversify its portfolio by \ntargeting regional loans to reach 55% of GLP by FYE2017, and to continue benefiting from its \nhighly granular portfolio, which is diversified across multiple sectors. More than 50% of the loan \nbook is dollar-denominated and neither ABA nor its borrowers have been tested through a sharp \ndevaluation of the local currency. To mitigate devaluation risk, ABA applies a discount on the \nface amount of the sub-loans issued to its borrowers. \n24.  Refinancing risk. ABA has consistently sourced non-depositor funding to support its \nasset growth due to the challenges in deposit mobilization in Azerbaijan. However, ABA\u2019s long-\nterm  access  to  financial  support  from  shareholders  may  be  constrained  by  their  single \ninvestment and borrower exposure limits. Recently, ABA has diversified its borrowing to several ", "        7 \nlenders, many of which have long-term investment horizons. To deepen funding sources, ABA \nhas committed to augment its depositor base by increasing its deposit to loan ratio during the \nterm of the ADB loan. In addition, strong funding flows from loan repayments and ABA\u2019s long-\nrunning relationships with its international creditors will continue to help secure its refinancing \nrequirements. \n25.  Capital adequacy. ABA\u2019s capital adequacy could come under pressure as a result of \nhigh business growth coupled with material negative macroeconomic or political events. To \nmitigate this risk, ABA maintains a conservative capital position. ABA\u2019s shareholders have also \nindicated support for ABA\u2019s continued growth through moderate dividend payouts and flexibility \nif higher retained earnings are required. By FYE2017, ABA expects its capital to grow by  \n$50 million to $170 million, which should provide adequate room for its business growth.  \n26.  Loan portfolio growth. ABA has conservatively estimated its loan portfolio to grow at a \nCAGR of 13% during 2013\u20132017, while loans in the regions are expected to grow at a CAGR of \n15%. During 2013, ABA\u2019s loan growth will remain high at 30%, reflecting opportunities in the \nMSME market and the focus on regional expansion. Repeat borrowers represent 76% of ABA\u2019s \ncurrent loan portfolio and have successfully gone through earlier borrowing cycles. ABA has put \nin place adequate processes, staffing plans, and information technology systems to support the \nbusiness targets until FYE2017. The regional branch expansion from 19 at FYE2012 to 28 at \nFYE2013 and an additional 3\u20135 branches annually from 2014 to 2016 will provide ABA with a \nstronger platform for growth. ABA staff are well prepared for the expansion, including the rollout \nof a new core banking information technology system. \n27.  Sustainability of asset quality and internal controls. ABA\u2019s asset quality metrics are \nfavorable with an NPL ratio of 1.15% in 2012, down from 1.4% in 2011, well below the average \nNPL ratio of the country\u2019s SME segment of 10%. However, asset quality may be adversely \naffected by its planned portfolio expansion in the next 5 years. ABA standardized the credit \nunderwriting (using rigorous analysis of client cash flows to determine debt service repayment \ncapacity)  and  approval  process  through  the  extensive  training  of  field  officers  and  close \nmonitoring  by  experienced  senior  loan  officers.    Further,  ABA  has  implemented  a  strong \nperformance-based pay scheme for loan officers, where pay is adjusted monthly based on each \nloan  officer\u2019s  portfolio  performance.  This  approach  supports  timely  collections  of  any \noutstanding loan amounts. \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n28.  Impact. The impacts are (i) increased availability of bank credit to the regional non-oil \neconomy, and (ii) expansion of private banking services in Azerbaijan\u2019s regions. This will be \nreflected by an increase in the private credit-to-GDP ratio, and increased private credit to \nregions outside Baku. Also expected is an increased contribution of MSMEs to Azerbaijan\u2019s \neconomic output and employment. However, these impacts currently cannot be measured \naccurately in the absence of public information on these metrics. \n29.  Outcome. The outcome is growth of MSMEs financed by a sustainable ABA, fulfilling its \ncore  mandate  of  prudently  serving  more  MSMEs  and  their  diverse  business  needs  in \nAzerbaijan. ABA is expected to set an example for other banks in deepening its outreach to \nrural areas, while retaining good asset quality and funding private agricultural activity with \nemployment and income benefits for the business owners and their staff. ", "8   \n30.  Outputs. The outputs are that ABA will improve its service outreach to MSMEs in the \nregions, and diversify its credit risk exposure by reducing concentration in Baku. ABA will \nensure  that  adequate  investment  is  made  in  human  resources,  processes,  and  branch \ninfrastructure in the regions. Providing capital to MSMEs, including farms, will strengthen their \nrole  as  an  important  source  of  employment,  especially  in  poverty-stricken  rural  areas. \nEmphasizing lending based on MSME cash flows, expanding into remote areas, and providing \nterm finance will help serve the regional economy and diversify ABA\u2019s risk and income profile. \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n31.  Under Strategy 2020, ADB aims to strengthen its support for the finance sector by \nsupporting the development of financial infrastructure, institutions, and products and services; \nand by promoting inclusive growth.14 Through such initiatives, ADB will encourage channeling of \nsavings  into  productive  investments.  The  building  of  inclusive  financial  systems  will  be \nsupported  through  ABA\u2019s  emphasis  on  funding  regions  where  productivity  is  low,  and  the \npotential for employment and income generation is high. The loan will help ABA to reach rural \nMSMEs, and is consistent with government efforts to promote growth in these areas, particularly \nto diversify economic growth in private non-oil activities. Strategy 2020\u2019s target for poverty \nreduction through private sector development will be supported via ABA\u2019s emphasis on activities \nin the regions where poverty vulnerability is highest. \n32.  An  ADB  financial  sector  assessment15 and  an  evaluation  of  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to \nAzerbaijan16 were completed in 2012. A country partnership strategy is currently being prepared. \nThe reports all highlight the importance of developing private and financial institutions, and the \nneed for intensified financial intermediation. More diversified financial services away from Baku \nand oil will capture essential qualitative growth opportunities in neglected regions and sectors, \nand encourage sound risk management. The reports highlight that agriculture and SMEs have \ninadequate  access  to  financial  services,  and  that  lending  support  via  financial  institutions \npresents the greatest opportunity for ADB\u2019s private sector operations. The global financial crisis \nhighlighted the importance of resilient banking systems to protect against adverse impacts on \npopulations. \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n33.  Financial sector development is a key focus of ADB assistance as set out in ADB\u2019s \nPrivate Sector Development Strategy17 and Enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy,18 which note \neconomic  growth,  stimulated  by  private  sector  investment,  as  a  key  contributing  factor  in \nreducing poverty. These strategies also note the importance of generating jobs, with private \nsector employment being the major source of income for workers and their families. The Private \nSector Development Strategy emphasizes ADB\u2019s role in strengthening finance sectors in its \ndeveloping member countries. It provides that SME beneficiaries of financial intermediation are \nimportant employers and providers of income to contribute to poverty reduction. Support of \nfinancial intermediaries is important to instill confidence and rehabilitate the finance sector in \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2008.

", "        9 \ncountries affected by macroeconomic shocks and financial crises. The loan is consistent with \nADB\u2019s financial sector operational plan and the 2007 report of the Working Group on Rural \nPoverty, which underscores the importance of rural finance and promotes financial inclusion of \nunderserved poor households, farmers, and SMEs.19  \n34.  ADB plays an important role in supporting deepening of services in Azerbaijan\u2019s finance \nsector. Since 2005, ADB has provided nonsovereign loans of $45 million to banks, comprising \n(i)  $15  million  in  total  senior  loans  to  ABA,  Azerigas  Bank,  and  Bank  Respublika;  (ii)  a  \n$20  million  subordinated  loan  to  IBA;  and  (iii)  a  $10  million  subordinated  loan  to  Bank \nRespublika. ABA, Bank of Baku, Bank Respublika, and Demir Bank also benefit from ADB\u2019s \nTrade Finance Program, with an approved total exposure limit of $17.5 million. The proposed \nloan would be ADB\u2019s second loan to ABA, building on the success of the previous loan, and \nspecifically targeting MSMEs in the regions where access to finance is most limited. \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), ADB\u2019s senior loan is \nclassified category FI based on potential impacts on the environment, and category FI treated \nas C for impacts on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. Subloans classified as \nenvironment category A and social safeguards categories A and B will not be financed under \nADB\u2019s  senior  loan.  The  potential  environment  and  social  impacts  of  subloans,  the  risks \nassociated with ABA\u2019s existing and likely future portfolio, and ABA\u2019s commitment and capacity \nfor environmental and social management were assessed. The existing environmental and \nsocial management system (ESMS) established by ABA and agreed modifications requested by \nADB are deemed adequate to comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. ABA will ensure \nthat investments using ADB funds do not involve business activities on the ADB prohibited \ninvestment activities list. ABA will enhance its existing ESMS to implement modifications agreed \nwith ADB before the first disbursement of the loan. The ESMS will provide for ABA compliance \nwith  applicable  national  safeguard  requirements  on  environment,  health,  and  safety;  and \nsafeguard requirements of its international financing partners such as ADB, EBRD, and IFC. \nThe ESMS also provides for ABA compliance with national labor laws and measures required \nby international core labor standards in accordance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.20 \n36.  ADB has made significant efforts during its due diligence to assess ABA\u2019s commitment \nand capacity for promoting gender equity, and to ensure that gender inclusiveness is an integral \nfeature of this transaction. Women comprise 35% of ABA staff and represent 24% of senior and \nmiddle management; ABA\u2019s human resource policies are based on equal opportunities. ABA \nalso  targets  female  customers  as  an  important  business  segment,  and  ABA\u2019s  commercial \npolicies and practices support equal opportunities for women to access services and markets. \nThis is demonstrated by recent statistics, where ABA had 34,000 female borrowers in 2012 (up \nfrom 26,000 in 2009), representing about 27% of overall borrowers. ABA has taken proactive \nsteps to promote a gender-inclusive ethos, which is likely to generate significant benefits for \nfemale customers. As such, this transaction is classified SGE (some gender elements) under \nADB\u2019s guidelines.21 ABA\u2019s reporting requirements to ADB include reporting on subloans by \ngender; ADB will monitor progress in supporting female borrowers.  \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2007.

ABA was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \nC.  Investment Limitations \n38.  The proposed senior loan is within the medium-term country, industry, group, and single \ninvestment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \nD.  Assurances \n39.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank 22  the    \nGovernment of Azerbaijan will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance to ABA. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance \nsatisfactory  to  ADB,  following  approval  of  the  proposed  assistance  by  the  ADB  Board  of \nDirectors. \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n40.  I am satisfied that the proposed senior loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, under the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the senior loan of $50,000,000 to AccessBank Azerbaijan for Promoting Rural Financial \nInclusion in Azerbaijan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with such terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to \nthe Board. \n \n \nBindu N.
