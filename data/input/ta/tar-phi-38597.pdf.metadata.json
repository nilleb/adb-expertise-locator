The Government of the Republic of the Philippines has requested technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to increase access and efficiency of microfinance services \nfor the poor in frontier1 areas that have little or no access to formal or semiformal financial services. \nMicrofinance is recognized as the central strategy for poverty reduction in the Philippines under \nRepublic Act 8425 Social Reform and Poverty Alleviation Act passed in 1997, and is an important \npart of President Arroyo\u2019s 10-point agenda. The Philippine Country Strategy and Program Update \n(CSPU) 2004\u20132006 includes microfinance as a key area of assistance to support the Government\u2019s \npoverty reduction program. Ensuring permanent access to institutional financial services for poor \nand low-income households at competitive prices is also a goal of ADB\u2019s Microfinance Development \nStrategy.2  \n \n2.  Based upon consultations with the National Anti-Poverty Commission (NAPC) and other \nagencies  from  July-October  2004,  the  Government  and  ADB  reached  an  agreement  on  the \nobjectives, scope, cost estimates and financing plan, and implementation arrangements. The TA3 \nwill provide (i) capacity building to nongovernment microfinance institutions (MFIs) in frontier areas \nto increase skills and best practices for sustainable microfinance, and (ii) education for poor and low-\nincome groups on microfinance services. NAPC is mandated under RA 8425 as the oversight body \nto ensure development and strengthening of the microfinance industry, and the chair of NAPC is the \nPresident  of  the  Philippines.  This  TA  will  complement  ongoing  assistance  and  build  on  prior \ndevelopments in the sector. The TA framework is provided in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.   ISSUES \n \n3.  The majority of poor households in the Philippines do not have access to microfinance \nservices,  and  rely  on  self-finance  or  informal  sources  of  microfinance,  limiting  their  ability  to \nparticipate in and benefit from development opportunities and income-generating activities. Access \nto microfinance services can help the poor build viable businesses, pursue economic opportunities \nand income-generating activities, and reduce vulnerability to external shocks. Of the 4.3 million poor \nhouseholds4 in the Philippines, only 1.17 million, or less than one third have access to microfinance \nservices. Improved access and efficient provision of services can enable the poor to smoothen their \nconsumption, manage their risks better, build assets, develop microenterprises, and enhance their \nincome-earning capacity. Microfinance encompasses a range of services including deposits, loans, \npayment services, money transfers, and insurance. Various microfinance services are provided in \nthe Philippines by banks, cooperatives, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs), including nearly \n120 banks (rural banks and thrift banks),  about 500 NGOs, and many of the 3,000 registered \ncooperatives. Banks engaged in microfinance are presently reaching about 400,000 clients and the \nNGO and cooperative sectors are reaching around 600,000 clients.5  \n \n4.  The  Government  seeks  to  support  the  development  and  strengthening  of  microfinance \nservices and frameworks across all channels including banks, NGOs, and cooperatives to achieve a \nvibrant and competitive microfinance market. ADB has supported the development of microfinance \n                                                 \n1  Frontier areas are municipalities and barangays with the following conditions: (i) hard to reach or where access is a \nproblem because of geographic location (highlands or islands); (ii) high poverty incidence and high magnitude of poor \nfamilies based on National Statistics Office (NSO) and National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) data; (iii) areas \nthat lack access to other basic services and infrastructure facilities; and (iv) areas where the saturation rate, in terms of \naccess to microfinance services, is very low or zero (saturation rate is the ratio between the potential poor target \nhouseholds and the actual number of clients reached in a given area). \n2  ADB. 2000.

Asian Development Bank.  \n ", "2  \nin the Philippines, including through the Rural Microenterprise Finance Project concluded in 2002.6 \nThis project had a major impact on the institutional structure of the microfinance industry as it \nbrought formal, regulated, small-scale financial institutions into the industry and made it a more \ndiverse one, mainstreaming microfinance in regulated financial institutions and assisting to break a \nbarrier to entry for many rural banks. NGO MFIs play an important role in providing services as they \noften operate in hard-to-reach areas where the private sector has not entered and there is less \ninformation available on the markets and potential clients. NAPC has targeted support for the NGO \nMFI  sector,  given  the  recognized  needs  for  capacity  building  and  the  potential  for  increasing \noutreach to the poor in the frontier areas through this channel. Rural bank development is also \nimportant, and capacity building for rural banks has been provided on an ongoing basis under the \nMicroenterprise Access to Banking Services Program, which was extended in 2004 for another three \nyears.7 \n \n5.  Limited institutional capacity of MFIs is a recognized constraint to growth and sustainable \noutreach.8  Many  MFIs  lack  basic  skills  for  sustainable,  effective,  and  efficient  delivery  of \nmicrofinance services to the poor. Inefficiencies in operations can result in higher operating costs \nthat translate into unnecessarily high interest rates for the poor. Many MFIs need skills development \nin areas including (i) management, (ii) financial reporting and disclosure, (iii) credit and cash flow \nanalysis, (iv) risk management, (v) performance monitoring systems and standards for MFIs, and \n(vi) best practices for sustainable microfinance. MFIs must set interest rates to cover their costs for \nsustainable operations; however, well-designed performance monitoring systems and standardized \nfinancial  reporting  could  enable  MFIs  to  better  manage  their  costs  and  improve  efficiencies, \npotentially lowering interest rates for the poor. \n \n6.  The limited outreach  of microfinance services is shown in NAPC\u2019s 2004 report,  Status of \nMicrofinance Outreach in 60 Poorest Provinces, which shows the outreach, potential number of \nclient  households,  and  saturation  level  of  microfinance  services  in  each  area.  The  Philippine \nNational Strategy for Microfinance focuses on building a viable and sustainable private microfinance \nmarket with greater access by poor households and microentrepreneurs. However, many of the poor \nare not aware or informed of microfinance services or the rights and obligations of clients. Because \nthe  poor  are  often  marginalized  or  disadvantaged,  social  intermediation  and  mobilization  are \nnecessary to introduce them to a formal or semiformal, market-oriented institutional environment. \nIncreased consumer education, especially in the outer provinces and frontiers, is needed as the very \npoor often need assistance in obtaining the information to use those services. \n \n7.    Lessons learned include recognition of the need to encourage new players to enter the \nmarket, and the critical need for existing MFIs to expand outreach to the poor to meet demand. Lack \nof  appropriate  retail  institutional  capacity  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the  most  significant \nconstraints to expanding outreach. Assistance for microfinance studies and projects has been \nprovided by USAID, World Bank, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),  German \nTechnical Cooperation (GTZ), and others. ADB through its membership in the Consultative Group to \nAssist the Poor (CGAP), established in 1995 with bilateral and multilateral funding agencies, will \n                                                 \n6  Prior to the $20 million Rural Microenterprise Finance Project, ADB had approved three projects in microenterprise credit \ntotaling $108 million: Loan 940-PHI: NGO Microcredit Project for $8 million approved in December 1988; Loan 1137-PHI \nSecond NGO Microcredit Project for $30 million approved in November 1991; and Loan 1216-PHI: Small Farmers Credit \nProject for $75 million approved in 1992. Assistance was also provided under RETA 5670: Technical Assistance for \nLow-Income Women Entrepreneurs in Asia for $600,000 approved in January 1996. \n7  The program is jointly implemented by the Rural Bankers Association of the Philippines and the Mindanao Economic \nDevelopment Council, with oversight and funding provided by the United States Agency for International Development.   \n8  Delivering to the Poor: A Search for Successful Practices in Philippines Microfinance.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n8.  The purpose of the TA is to support the development of a sound and viable financial system \nthat can provide efficient and sustainable microfinance services for the poor, enabling them to \npursue economic opportunities and income-generating activities. The TA will support education for \nthe poor on microfinance. RA 8425, which recognizes microfinance as the central strategy for \npoverty reduction, defines the poor in terms of \u201cbasic sectors\u201d. The basic sectors are marginalized \nand disadvantaged groups whose income falls below the poverty threshold as defined by the \nNational Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) and/or cannot afford in a sustained manner \nto provide their minimum basic needs of food, health, education, housing and other essential \namenities of life. The basic sector groups identified in RA 8425 are farmer-peasants and landless \nrural workers, artisanal fisherfolk, workers in the formal sector and migrant workers, workers in the \ninformal sector, indigenous peoples and cultural communities, women, persons with disabilities, \nsenior citizens, victims of calamities and disasters, youth and students, children, and urban poor. \n \n9.  The expected outputs of the TA are:  \n \n (i)   An  assessment  of  (a)  NGO  MFIs;  (b)  microfinance  access  and  demand;  and \n(c) informal finance in frontier areas based on field survey to collect information \nincluding: \n\u2022  institutional capacity and operations of NGO MFIs in frontier areas (including    \noutreach, client profile, information access on potential clients, and impact of \nmicrofinance services); \n\u2022  NGO MFIs concerns and issues for outreach and sustainability; \n\u2022  alternative financing sources available in the survey areas including informal \nsources of microfinance; \n\u2022  information on products and services provided through informal microfinance \nchannels; \n\u2022  concerns and issues of poor households in accessing microfinance (including \ncurrent clients and potential target groups); \n\u2022  information on poor households use and management of funds obtained from \nMFIs  (including  intra-household  decision  making  and  control  of  funds \ndisaggregated by gender); and \n\u2022  training needs of NGO MFIs. \n \nBased on the field survey results and studies produced from that data, NGO MFIs \nand branches will be selected for on-site mentoring and training, and the training \nmodules will be prepared in accordance with the identified needs. The survey will \nidentify the needs and concerns of the poor, and educational materials and seminars \nwill be designed to address those issues. This field survey will also provide NAPC \nwith important baseline information for the NGO MFI sector for further monitoring of \nperformance, growth, outreach and impact of microfinance services.   \n \n(ii)  NGO  MFIs  trained in best practices for sustainable microfinance through on-site \nmentoring and training. Training will be conducted at 15 NGO MFIs and/or branches \nin designated frontier areas. The NGO MFIs will increase skills and best practices for \neffective and efficient service delivery to the poor. Training and reference materials \nwill be prepared in consultation with NAPC, Microfinance Council of the Philippines \n(MCPI), and ADB for the on-site mentoring and training. Although the final training \n ", "4  \nmodules will depend on the results of the field survey, basic skills development is \nexpected  to  encompass  (a) financial  reporting  and  disclosure,  including  CGAP9 \nDisclosure Guidelines for Financial Reporting by Microfinance Institutions; (b) credit \nand cash-flow analysis; (c) risk management; (d) performance monitoring systems; \n(e) performance  standards  including  the  National  Credit  Council  Performance \nStandards for MFIs; and (f) other best practices for sustainable microfinance. Training \nmaterials will be prepared in English and local dialects (as needed). In addition to the \non-site training, materials will be posted on the NAPC web site and distributed by \nNAPC to training centers, universities, and associations for broader circulation and \nuse. \n \n(iii)  Education  of  the  poor.  Educational  seminars/workshops  on  microfinance  will  be \nconducted  for  the  poor  in  frontier  areas  to  increase  their  knowledge  and \nunderstanding of microfinance services. It is expected that seminars/workshops will \nbe  conducted  in  30  frontier  areas,  and  that  each  seminar/workshop  could \naccommodate up to 100 participants for a total participation of up to 3,000 people. \nAlthough the final educational materials/pamphlets will be designed based upon the \nresults  of  the  field  survey,  the  educational  materials  are  expected  to  cover \n(a) knowledge of financial intermediation, (b) microfinance policies, (c) microfinance \nservices and practices, and (d) rights and obligations of clients. Educational materials \nwill be prepared in English and local dialects. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  ADB  will  continue  to  coordinate  closely  with  other  funding  agencies  during  the \nimplementation of the project. The TA will proceed in three phases. During the first phase a field \nsurvey will be conducted in frontier areas of (i) NGO MFIs and branches and (ii) the poor/basic \nsectors. Frontier areas will be selected by NAPC based on Government regional and provincial \npoverty indices and microfinance saturation rate. Those provinces with a high poverty index (greater \nthan or equal to 40%) and low saturation rate (less than or equal to 20%) will be prioritized. The field \nsurvey will be designed in consultation with NAPC and the Microfinance Council of the Philippines \n(MCPI).10  The second phase will include analysis of the survey results and selection of NGO MFIs \nand branches for on-site mentoring and training. NGO MFIs will be selected based on their potential \nfor outreach and sustainability as determined from results of the field survey and studies and other \navailable information, including reports from the MCPI, NAPC, and other agencies. NAPC will select \nthe NGO MFIs and branches subject to ADB approval. During the second phase, the educational \nmaterials/pamphlets for the microfinance seminars/workshops for the poor will also be developed, \nbased upon needs identified in the survey and other available information. The third phase of the TA \nwill include the on-site mentoring and training of selected NGO MFIs and branches, and educational \nseminars/workshops for the poor in frontier areas. Participation of the basic sectors in frontier areas \nin the educational seminars/workshops on microfinance will be mobilized by NAPC through the \nGovernment\u2019s  KALAHI11  system  and  basic  sector  councils  under  NAPC.  The  consultants  will \n                                                 \n9  The Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) was formally established in 1995 with bilateral and multilateral \nfunding agencies, including ADB, to expand poor people\u2019s access to quality financial services from sustainable or \npotentially sustainable MFIs. The CGAP Secretariat is located in World Bank headquarters. \n10  The Microfinance Council of the Philippines is a federation of MFIs, mostly NGOs, created in 1997. Membership criteria \nincludes: (i) a mission statement that includes a vision for the poor; (ii) at least 3,000 clients; (iii) a minimum portfolio of \nPhp10 million (USD 200,000); (iv) a three-year track record; (v) a manual of operations and a management information \nsystem; (vi) membership fees and dues; and (vii) SEC documents for corporations. \n11 Pursuant  to  Memorandum  Circular  No.  33  Institutionalizing  Kapit  Bisig  Laban  Sa  Kahirapan  (KALAHI) as the \nGovernment\u2019s Program for Poverty Reduction issued in November 2002, the Government, through KALAHI, will solicit \nactive participation of basic sector organizations, other civil society organizations, and the business sector in its poverty \nreduction programs or activities. This multi-stakeholder and interagency convergence policy is applied in all NAPC \npoverty reduction initiatives. \n ", "  5\nconduct a workshop presentation of TA results and findings for NAPC officials and other agencies \nand parties designated by NAPC. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $357,000 equivalent comprising a foreign exchange cost of \n$70,000 and a local currency cost of $287,000 equivalent. The Government has requested ADB to \nfinance the entire foreign exchange cost of $70,000 and $180,000 equivalent of the local currency \ncost.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Governance  Cooperation  Fund  and \nadministered by  ADB.12 The Government will provide facilities and counterpart support valued at \n$107,000 equivalent. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  NAPC will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The TA will be implemented over 18 months \nand is expected to begin in February 2005 and be completed by July 2006. As the coordinating and \noversight body for the Government's poverty reduction initiatives, NAPC coordinates through its \ncommittees  and  KALAHI  groups  that  include  the  Department  of  Budget  and  Management, \nDepartment of Trade and Industry, National Economic and Development Authority, Department of \nInterior and Local Government, and many other Government agencies and commissions. The TA \nwill require a total of 26 person-months of consulting services, consisting of 4 person-months of \ninternational and 22 person-months of domestic consulting services. Requirements for consulting \nservices include one international microfinance specialist and two domestic microfinance specialists. \nNAPC  will  provide  counterpart  staff  and  office  accommodation.  ADB  will  engage  individual \nconsultants in accordance with the  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development \nBank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. The outline terms of reference are included in Appendix 3. The consultants will provide \ninception, interim, mid-term, and final reports, and provide weekly briefings to NAPC officials. NAPC \nwill  also  undertake  the  administration  and  supervision  of  the  field  survey  and  purchase  the \nequipment. Services and equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. The equipment will be turned over to NAPC upon completion of the TA.   \n \n13.  The TA results will be distributed through the NAPC and ADB web sites and through NAPC\u2019s \nKALAHI  network.  There  will  also  be  a  workshop  for  NAPC  and  other  agencies  and  parties \ndesignated by NAPC on the TA results and findings. In addition to distribution of materials during on-\nsite mentoring and training and seminars in the frontier areas, training materials for MFIs and \neducational materials/pamphlets for the poor will be posted on NAPC's web site and distributed by \nNAPC to designated training centers, universities, associations, and local governments. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 to the Government of \nthe Philippines to be financed on a grant basis by the Governance Cooperation Fund for Enhancing \nAccess of the Poor to Microfinance Services in Frontier Areas, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n                                                 \n12  The Governance Cooperation Fund is a multidonor umbrella facility which helps to promote the basic goals of ADB's \nMedium-Term Agenda and Action Plan in the area of governance.
