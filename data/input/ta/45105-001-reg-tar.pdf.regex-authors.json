INTRODUCTION \n1.  Under  its  Strategy  2020, 1  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  identified \nenvironmentally  sustainable  growth,  including  infrastructure  and  climate  change,  as  a  top \ndevelopment  and  operational  priority.  Consistent  with  Strategy  2020,  ADB  is  refocusing \noperations in the transport sector to place greater emphasis on sustainability, as outlined in \nADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative\u2013Operational Plan (STI\u2013OP) approved in July 2010.2 The \nSustainable Transport Initiative is being implemented under the guidance of ADB\u2019s transport \ncommunity of practice as a tool to help ADB adapt its transport operations to serve the changing \nneeds of the developing member countries (DMCs). \n \n2.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) is a cluster TA project targeting three of the four \nkey pillars for implementing sustainable transport under the STI\u2013OP, namely: (i) urban transport, \n(ii)  climate  change  in  transport,  and  (iii)  road  safety  and  social  sustainability.  The  cluster \napproach is proposed because all the subprojects are in line with the STI\u2013OP and inclusion in \nthe cluster TA offers significant potential synergies while greatly reducing transaction costs for \nthe TA project implementation.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  As defined in the STI\u2013OP, a sustainable transport system is one that is accessible, safe, \nenvironment friendly, and affordable. In the Asia and Pacific region, a range of challenges face \nthe sustainability of the transport sector. In particular, these include rapid motorization and \nurbanization that are affecting the social sustainability of transport, transport\u2019s emergence as the \nlargest and fastest growing sector for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, high accident rates, a \ngap  in  transport  infrastructure  and  transport  services,  and  regional  integration  and  trade \nfacilitation that is hampered by current arrangements for cross-border transport and logistics. \nThis TA addresses urban transport, climate change, and social sustainability aspects of these \nchallenges. ADB is already implementing substantial work on other STI\u2013OP priorities, including \ncross-border transport and logistics through the Office of Regional Economic Integration, as well \nas activities on road safety that are currently being considered for other financing sources. \n \n4.  As a result of rising incomes, per capita vehicle ownership is rising exceptionally fast, \nand  especially  in  Asia\u2019s  cities,  where  motor  vehicle  fleets  are  doubling  every  5\u20137  years. \nEmerging Asian countries are estimated to have added 35 million vehicles between 2006 and \n2009. These trends are placing an enormous strain on transport and mobility in urban areas. \nRoad  congestion  already  costs  Asian  economies  an  estimated  2%\u20135%  of  gross  domestic \nproduct every year. Uncontrolled growth in urban road traffic and rising congestion are also \ncompromising the health and safety of urban dwellers. The region's cities suffer from the highest \nair pollution levels in the world, with as much as 80% of that attributable to transport. According \nto World Health Organization data, air pollution\u2014including that from transport\u2014imposes an \neconomic cost of up to 2%\u20134% of gross domestic product in many countries. \n \n5.  Rapid motorization and urbanization is also resulting in declining social sustainability of \ntransport. About 70% (800 million) of the world\u2019s poor live in Asia and, although poverty is \nsometimes perceived to be a rural phenomenon, the incidence of urban and peri-urban poverty \nis significant and growing. Almost 25% of Asia\u2019s urban population is poor. About 250 million \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2  ADB. 2010. Sustainable Transport Initiative\u2013Operational Plan. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 October 2011. \n ", "2   \npoor people in Asia reside in urban areas, and this figure is projected to reach 300 million by \n2020. The decrease in modal share of nonmotorized transport (NMT), the increase in journey \nlengths due to urban design, and rising public transport costs are all making transport for the \npoor less affordable while depriving many of access to markets and services. \n \n6.  Energy use in the transport sector is dominated by petroleum product fuels, and the \nshare of transport within total global GHG emissions, in particular carbon dioxide (CO ), is \n2\ngrowing rapidly. In 2006, transport accounted for 13% of global GHG, while 23% of global CO  \n2\nemissions from fuel combustion were transport-related. The vast majority of projected increases \nare expected to come from developing Asia. Asia\u2019s emissions from motorized transport have \nbecome a significant contributor to the global GHG problem that leads to climate change. While \nAsia accounted for 19% of total transport sector CO  emissions in 2006, by 2030 this figure is \n2\nforecast to increase to 31% if current trends continue.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n7.  The TA project will develop subprojects at interregional, subregional, country, and city \nlevels that contribute toward building capacity among DMCs to develop and implement policies, \nprograms, and projects that will enhance the economic, social, and environmental sustainability \nof transport infrastructure and services. Increased capacity among DMCs will enable ADB to \nbetter align its existing and future transport operations with the three strategic agendas of \nStrategy 2020: inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional \nintegration.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be to establish a trend toward enhanced sustainability of \ntransport systems in participating DMCs in the Asia and Pacific region. The overall outcome of \nthe cluster TA will be increased awareness of the critical importance of sustainability in transport \nsystem development, and a greater readiness and capacity of DMCs in the Asia and Pacific \nregion to identify, develop, and implement sustainable transport policies, programs, and projects. \nThis will be measured by the number of participating DMCs having initiated development of \nsustainable  transport-related  policies  while  having  identified  and  initiated  development  of \nsustainable transport programs and projects. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA has six subprojects that together provide an integrated approach to addressing \nkey aspects of the STI\u2013OP\u2019s pillars. Additional subprojects, or topping up of initial subprojects, \nmay be proposed later. The subprojects are: \n \n10.  Subproject A: Greenhouse gas assessment methodologies in sustainable public \ntransport. This subproject will support STI\u2013OP pillar (ii), climate change in transport. It will \ndevelop a GHG calculator that can be integrated into the existing planning and management of \npublic transport operating companies. The main target group is public transport operators and \ngovernment entities regulating these companies. Many existing tools for assessing the GHG \nimpacts of public transport operations and investments are too complex for regular use by public \ntransport managers. New sketch-type methodologies, such as the transportation  emissions \nevaluation model for projects, offer the potential cost-effectively to provide emission estimates in \na  user-friendly  manner.  The  subproject  will  refine  the  existing  transportation  emissions \nevaluation model for projects GHG calculator and apply the methodology in selected cities in \n ", "  3 \nseveral DMCs, develop a recognition program for bus operating firms achieving excellence in \nGHG reduction, examine barriers to mainstreaming climate change into operations, suggest \nways to overcome these barriers, and recommend financing options for their implementation.  \n \n11.  Subproject B: New approaches to implement sustainable low-carbon transport in \nthe Asia and Pacific region. This subproject also will support STI\u2013OP pillar (ii) climate change \nin transport. It will address climate change in transport through knowledge and conceptual \napproaches for sustainable transport support in key subsectors, including railways, inland water \ntransport, urban transport, and freight and logistics. Activities under this subproject will help to \nidentify and address barriers preventing DMCs from strengthening these subsectors and will \nidentify  future  lending  opportunities  for  these  subsectors.  This  subproject  will  support \nidentification,  processing,  and/or  implementation  of  sustainable  low-carbon  ADB  transport \nprojects. Such support will enable mitigation activities to be incorporated into project selection \nand design, allow assessing GHG impacts of specific project components, and support capacity \nbuilding on mitigating climate change through transport-related activities. It also will help source \nadditional climate finance from such mechanisms as the Global Environment Facility, Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism, and/or nationally appropriate mitigation actions.  \n \n12.  Subproject  C:  Promoting  socially  sustainable  transport  through  improving \nnonmotorized transport. This subproject will support STI\u2013OP pillar (iv) social sustainability. It \nwill pilot NMT components aimed at improving integrated and inclusive public transport systems \nin DMCs. Improving walking and cycling facilities while linking these to improved public transport \nwill help provide affordable door-to-door mobility. The results of these pilots will be utilized in \ndesigning regional guidelines on integrating NMT with public transport systems. This subproject \nwill (i) support the addition of NMT components to existing ADB transport projects, (ii) help \ncatalyze new NMT initiatives, and (iii) provide formal social impact analysis of selected ADB \ntransport projects. The support will deliver high-quality demonstration efforts and create the \nmethodological basis for future social impact analysis of ADB projects. This subproject also will \nprovide  demonstration  units  of  NMT  technologies  (e.g.,  public  bicycles  and  pedicabs)  for \noutreach purposes to cities. \n \n13.  Subproject  D:  Better  transport  data  for  sustainable  transport  policies  and \ninvestment planning. This subproject will help improve the availability and quality of transport \ndata in the Asia and Pacific region and thus provide direct inputs to each of the STI\u2013OP pillars. \nCurrent data availability and quality limit the development of sustainable transport policies and \ninvestment  strategies  and  constrain  the  ability  to  evaluate  impacts  of  such  policies  and \ninvestments.  The  subproject  will  establish  historical  (2000\u20132010)  data  sets  on  transport \ninfrastructure and services as well as their social and environmental impacts. Moreover, it will \nprovide an outlook up to 2030. To reduce the risk that the data collection activities would be \nlimited to a one-off exercise, ADB has been consulting with other organizations to develop a \nmore permanent mechanism for transport data.  \n \n14.  Subproject  E:  Intelligent  transport  systems  for  better  urban  transport.  This \nsubproject will address STI\u2013OP pillar (i) urban transport. It will contribute to the development of \nstrategies  for  implementing  information  and  communication  technologies  for  better  public \ntransport service and travel demand management in urban areas. In particular, it will focus on \nintegrated ticketing and vehicle management systems based upon an on-board fuel and GHG \nindicator  unit,  wireless communication,  and global  positioning  systems. The  subproject  will \nreview the state of the art in these areas and conduct case studies of several cities in Asia. \nGuidelines and recommendations will be developed on how best to use intelligent transport \n ", "4   \nsystems in ADB projects on sustainable urban transport presently in processing and in future \nprojects. \n \n15.  Subproject  F:  Innovative  financing  of  sustainable  transport  through  market \nmechanisms. Capturing value from externalities offers the potential to greatly enhance and \ndiversify existing financing portfolios for sustainable transport initiatives. It is recognized that \ncarbon markets to date are not sufficient in and of themselves to alter project economics. For \nthis reason, capturing value from other sources, such as energy security, air quality and health, \nand  road  safety,  will  assist  in making  projects  bankable.  ADB  has  already  developed  the \nrationale behind a scheme for fuel security credits and has undertaken conceptual work on the \nidea of health credits. ADB has also conducted research on parking levies, land value capture, \nand congestion pricing. This subproject will support the development of a pilot demonstration of \nnew mechanisms, as well as strengthen the conceptual basis for emerging mechanisms. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The  estimated  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  $6.698  million,  broken  down  as  follows:  (i) \nsubproject A: $1.00 million, (ii) subproject B: $2.298 million, (iii) subproject C: $2.00 million, (iv) \nsubproject D: $1.00 million, (v) subproject E: $0.30 million, and (vi) subproject F: $0.10 million. \nThe aggregate cost will be financed on a grant basis as follows: (i) $1.00 million from ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV), (ii) $2.398 million from ADB\u2019s Climate Change \nFund4, (iii) $1.00 million from the Global Environment Facility and administered by ADB, (iv) \n$2.00 million from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB, and (v) \n$0.30  million  from  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  and \nadministered by ADB. The cost estimates and financing plan are detailed in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB  will  coordinate  the  TA  through  ADB  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment  (RSDD).  Once  the  cluster  TA  is  approved,  the  subproject  proposals  will  be \nsubmitted for approval to the director general of RSDD, in accordance with ADB guidelines on \ncluster TA processing.5 ADB will be the executing agency for each subproject.  \n \n18.  The TA will benefit from updated implementation arrangements which are being put in \nplace for implementing the STI\u2013OP. These include establishment of the STI\u2013OP management \ncommittee consisting of transport and urban development directors. It is intended that the STI\u2013\nOP management committee6 will have an important role in overseeing implementation of the TA. \nIn addition, advisory teams7 which have been set up under the transport community of practice \nfor the main transport subsectors targeted by ADB transport operations and the main themes of \nthe  STI\u2013OP  (e.g.,  climate  change  and  social  sustainability)  will  play  an  active  role  in \nimplementing  the  different  subprojects.  No  new  additional  institutional  arrangements  will, \ntherefore,  need  to  be  created  to  ensure  full  participation  of  the  regional  departments  in \nimplementing the TA. Direct responsibility for overall implementation of the TA will rest with the \nRSDD/Sustainable  Infrastructure  Division,  which  also  will  coordinate  with  the  regional \n                                                \n4  Established by ADB.  \n5  ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance. Operations Manual. OM D12/BP. Manila. \n6  The STI\u2013OP management committee will consist of relevant directors of the regional departments who will provide \ninsight and oversight on the administration of the TA projects to support the regional departments\u2019 operations. \n7  Transport community of practice advisory teams for subsector and thematic focus areas comprise transport staff \nacross ADB with representation from the regional departments, Private Sector Operations Department, and \nnonoperational departments. \n ", "  5 \ndepartments  to  ensure  smooth  and  timely  implementation  of  the  TA  and  linkage  to  other \ncommunity of practice activities. \n \n19.   In parallel to the financing and administration of the TA by ADB, the Government \nof the Republic of Korea (Ministry of Strategy and Finance) will provide in-kind collaboration of \nabout $0.30 million through the Knowledge Sharing Program, which is administered by Export-\n8\nImport Bank of the Republic of Korea.  This in-kind collaboration of the Government of the \nRepublic of Korea will be provided for Subproject E (intelligent transport systems for better \nurban transport). \n \n20.  The TA project is expected to be implemented from December 2011 to June 2014. The \nTA will require national consulting inputs of 124\u2013186 person-months and international consulting \ninputs  of  264\u2013330  person-months.  Consulting  inputs  will  be  required  from  both  firms  and \nindividuals  under  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  with  a  quality-cost  ratio  of  80:20.  All \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Given that this is a cluster TA project, \nconsultant  selection  will  apply  different  methods  depending  on the size  and  nature  of the \ncontracts. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. In limited cases, \nequipment will be required for demonstration purposes under the subprojects and for site offices. \nAll procurement of goods and other services under the TA will be made in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Upon completion of the \nTA,  all  equipment  procured  by  the  consultants  under the TA  will  be turned  over  to  ADB. \nDisbursements will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n21.  The President recommends that the Board approve (i) ADB administering a portion of \nthe technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction; and (ii) ADB providing a portion of the technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $3,398,000 on a grant basis for Implementation of \nSustainable Transport in Asia and the Pacific. If the Board approves ADB administering and \nproviding the technical assistance, the President, acting under the authority delegated by the \nBoard, will approve (i) ADB administering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the \nequivalent of $1,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Global Environment Facility; \nand (ii) ADB administering the balance of the technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent \nof $300,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge \nPartnership Fund for Implementation of Sustainable Transport in Asia and the Pacific. \n                                                \n8  The Knowledge Sharing Program was launched in 2004 by the Ministry of Strategy and Finance of the Republic of \nKorea to share the Republic of Korea\u2019s economic development experiences.
