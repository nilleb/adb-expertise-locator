It will help the \nGovernment deliver education to children in poor areas and from \ndisadvantaged  families.  The  Project  will  (i)  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s  efforts  in  modernizing  the  curriculum  with  a \nstudent-centered approach linked with developing an improved \nlearning assessment system and a new generation of textbooks \nand learning materials; (ii) strengthen in-service teacher training \nand  incentives  for  teachers  in  rural  areas;  and  (iii) rehabilitate \nfacilities and provide educational equipment for 90 priority schools \nin rural areas, to improve the learning environment. \n   \nRationale  Economic transition has had major implications for the quality of \neducation  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  Despite  high  educational \nattainment and near universal literacy during the Soviet period, \nthe education system currently needs considerable investment to \nimprove quality, access and participation, and to help the country \nsustain the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for education. \nMajor problems in the education sector arise from the current \ncurriculum,  the  state  of  the  teaching  profession,  and  limited \naccess to education in rural areas. The current curriculum differs \nsomewhat  from  the  Soviet  one  but  continues  the  tradition  of \nheavily  content-based  subjects.  The  development  and \nimplementation of a revised curriculum require a new generation \nof textbooks and learning materials that reflect it. The shortage of \nteachers  in  some  schools,  aging  of  the  teaching  corps,  and \ninability of the education system to provide adequate in-service \ntraining are key constraints to improving the quality of education. \nAll three problems stem from insufficient funding, resultant low \nsalaries for teachers, and the teaching profession\u2019s consequently \ndeclining incentives, morale, and motivation. Rural schools are \ndilapidated,  lack  learning  materials  and  equipment,  and  suffer \nattendance problems. \n ", "ii   \n  Commitment to improving both the quality and effectiveness of \neducation  is  a  key  element  of  the  Government's  economic \nstrategy. The overall development plans and strategies for the \neducation sector to 2010 are reflected in the national Education \nDevelopment Concept. The Ministry of Education (MOE) places a \nhigh priority on developing an education system that will provide \nknowledge and skills to meet the demands of a market economy.  \n \nThe Project will build on the achievements of the ADB-financed \nEducation  Sector  Development  Program.  Sustainability  of  the \nproject achievements will be ensured through broad stakeholder \nparticipation  from  different  levels  of  government,  local \ncommunities,  the  private  sector,  donors,  and  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs). \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project will be a general education system \nresponsive to the needs of a modern market-oriented economy \nand focused on poorer areas of the country. The outcomes of the \nProject are increased enrollment in primary and general education \nin poorer areas and student performance raised. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $21.85  million \nequivalent including physical and price contingencies, taxes, and \nduties. The foreign exchange cost is estimated at $4.78 million \nequivalent, or 22% of the total cost, with the local currency cost at \n$17.07 million equivalent, or 78%. \n   \nFinancing Plan   \n($ million) \n   Foreign  Local  Total  Percent \nSource  Exchange Currency  Cost   \nAsian  \nDevelopment Bank        4.78         10.72       15.50        71  \nGovernment         0.00           6.35         6.35        29  \n  Total         4.78         17.07        21.85      100  \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n   \nGrant Amount  ADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $15.50  million  equivalent  from  its \nSpecial Funds resources to finance 71% of the total project cost. \nThe remaining $6.35 million equivalent, or 29%, will be provided \nby the Government. Grant financing for the Project is considered \njustified because of its focus on basic (primary and secondary) \neducation, and the fact that a significant part of the investment \ntargets poor and remote areas. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2011 \n   \n ", "  iii\nEstimated Project  31 December 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Education \n   \nImplementation  A national project steering council will provide overall strategic \nArrangements  policy  guidance,  monitor  implementation,  and  ensure  donor \ncoordination.  The  first  deputy  minister  of  MOE  will  be  project \ndirector and coordinate overall implementation of project activities. \nA  central  project  implementation  unit  headed  by  a  project \nmanager  will  be  established  to  coordinate  day-to-day  project \nactivities. Two regional project implementation units headed by \nregional project coordinators will be located in oblast (province) \ndepartments  of  education  and  will  be  responsible  for  project \nactivities in oblasts. \n   \nProcurement  ADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Procurement  of  civil \nworks  will  be  carried  out  through  local  competitive  bidding. \nProcurement  of  equipment  will  be  through  international \ncompetitive bidding, and local competitive bidding satisfactory to \nADB, and by direct purchase. \n   \nConsulting Services  The  Project  will  contract  81  person-months  of  international \nconsulting  services  and  791  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting services.  These  will  include  experts  in  the  fields  of \npolicy research and evaluation, curriculum and learning materials \ndesign,  learning  assessment,  teacher  training,  procurement, \nfinance,  civil  engineering,  project  management,  accounting, \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  and  translation.  Consultants  will  be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  for  the  engagement  of \ndomestic consultants satisfactory to ADB. \n   \nProject Benefits and  Direct beneficiaries of the Project will be 50,000 students and \nBeneficiaries  1,500 teachers and school administrators in the 90 priority schools \nselected, who will benefit from a significantly improved learning \nenvironment. Teachers throughout the country will benefit from in-\nservice  teacher  training  programs.  Staff  of  teacher  training \ninstitutes throughout the country will benefit from their enhanced \ncapacity and upgraded teaching facilities. Nationwide, 1.14 million \nstudents  will  benefit  from  an  improved  curriculum  and  better \nlearning materials and assessment systems. \n \n \n ", "iv   \n  Benefits will include the improved quality of education in terms of \nteaching and learning standards. The new curriculum and learning \nassessment system will create an enabling environment to equip \na new generation of workforce entrants with knowledge and skills \nin  line  with  the  needs  of  a  market  economy.  The  Project  will \nenhance  efficiency  in  school  management,  particularly  by \nreducing  the  costs  of  utilities  and  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M). \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Implementation Capacity Risk. The risk exists that responsibilities \nor  tasks  required  will  be  beyond  the  capabilities  of  the  staff \nmembers to which they have been assigned. The risk will be \nmitigated through training and capacity building. \n \nSector  Policy  Risk.  Policy  impact  will  be  significant  with  the \nintroduction of a new curriculum and learning assessment system \nreflecting the Government\u2019s priority to improve access to, and the \nquality  of,  education  and  converting  to  a  12-year  system  of \neducation.  Risks  include  resistance  from  decision  makers  to \nrecommended policy or legislative changes, and from parents or \nthe community at large to new and unfamiliar innovations in the \ncurriculum  and  learning  assessment  system.  The  risk  will  be \nmitigated by adopting a stakeholder participatory approach and \nimplementing  a  public  awareness  campaign  that  includes  the \nactive involvement of local communities and NGOs.  \n \nFinancial  Sustainability  Risk.  Financial  risk  arises  from  the \npossible inability of national or local government to provide the \ncounterpart  resources  required  to  ensure  effective  project \nimplementation, or to provide for incremental recurrent costs for \nO&M during implementation and after project completion. The risk \nmay  lead  to  (i)  deterioration  of  facilities  due  to  lack  of \nmaintenance;  and  (ii)  discontinued  dissemination  of  new \ntextbooks  and  learning  materials, teaching  methodologies,  and \nlearning assessment systems after the project ends. To mitigate \nthe risk, ADB will work closely with the Government to ensure \nadequate  resource  allocation  for  the  education  sector,  project \ncounterpart funds, and incremental recurrent costs for O&M, and \nappropriate assurances are included. \n \n \n \n \n ", "o o\n71  00'E 78  00'E\nKYRGYZ  REPUBLIC\nSECOND EDUCATION PROJECT\nK A Z A K H S T A N\nTyup\n42o  30'N Dzhergalan 42 o 30'N\nShopokov Cholpon-Ata\nKara Balta BISHKEK Tokmok Lake Issyk-Kul Kara Kol\nCHUI Balykchy\nMaimak\nTalas ISSYK-KUL\nKochkorka\nTALAS\nChaek\nToktogul\nLake Song-Kul\nToktogul Reservoir\nNARYN\nNaryn\nKarakul\nTerek Sai JALAL-ABAD\nTash Kumyr\nShamaldy Sai Kok Yangak\nKochkor Ata\nJalal-Abad Lake Chatyr-Kul N\nAndizhan Reservoir\nUZBEKISTAN Kara Su Uzgen\nOsh\n0 50 100\nKilometers\nNaiman\nTAJIKISTAN Kyzyl Kiya OSH\nBatken Frunze\n38 o 00'N PEOPLE'S    REPUBLIC National Capital 38o  00'N\nHaidarkan Sary Tash OF   CHINA \nProvincial Capital\nSulyukta BATKEN\nCity/Town\nMain Road\nRailway\nRiver\nTAJIKISTAN\nProvincial Boundary\nInternational Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n0\n5\n-4\n0\n8\n8 R 71o  00'E 78o  00'E\nM", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Kyrgyz Republic for the Second Education Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  In 2001, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic requested from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) technical assistance1 (TA) for preparing the Second Education Project (the Project) \nas a follow-up to the Education Sector Development Program (ESDP).2 The Project is included \nin the 2004 Country Strategy and Program Update 2005\u20132006,3 which prioritizes investments in \neducation and early childhood development as important means of achieving poverty reduction. \nThe project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  The education system in the Kyrgyz Republic follows the Soviet model of 11 years of \ngeneral education. Primary education (grades 1\u20134) begins at age 6 or 7. Lower secondary \n(basic) education comprises grades 5\u20139. Basic education is compulsory. Upper secondary \neducation includes grades 10\u201311. The Ministry of Education (MOE) is responsible for setting \neducation  policy  and  standards,  and  it  controls  implementation  through  oblast  (province) \ndepartments of education and raion (district) departments of education. Aiyil okmotu (village \nauthorities) administer their schools and are responsible for allocating resources for school \noperation and maintenance (O&M). The structure of the education system is in Appendix 2. \n \n4.  There are 2,045 general education schools in the Kyrgyz Republic, of which 351 are \nurban and 1,694 rural. Of these, 1,614 schools used a single language of instruction (Kyrgyz, \nRussian,  or  Uzbek)  in  2004,  and  431  schools  used  two  or  more  languages  of  instruction \n(Kyrgyz, Russian, Uzbek, and/or Tajik). In school year (SY) 2004, most general education \nschools\u20141,525, or 75%\u2014operated in two shifts. In addition, 105 schools with a total of about \n18,100 students operated in three shifts. The number of children with special needs in inclusive \nclasses was 250 in SY2004. An analysis of the education sector is in Appendix 3. \n \n5.  The education reforms started in the Kyrgyz Republic in 1993, emphasizing accessibility \nfor all children without exception.4 Following independence in 1991, macroeconomic conditions \nin the Kyrgyz Republic deteriorated dramatically, resulting in a 50% decline in gross domestic \nproduct (GDP). In 1996, these trends reversed, and annual economic growth averaged 5% from \n1997 to 2004. Economic transition has had major implications for the financing of education. \nThe education budget declined sharply in the early 1990s and gradually started to increase \nagain in 1999. In real terms, education expenditure was increased gradually from $63.7 million \nin 1999 to $91.4 million in 2004, and it is projected to increase about 2% annually in 2005\u20132007. \nBy share of GDP, education expenditure has increased gradually from 4.0% in 1999 to 4.3% in \n2004, and it is expected to exceed 5.0% by 2010. Education expenditure as percentage of the \nnational  budget  varied  from  a  low  of  19.8%  in  2000  to  a  high  of  22.2%  in  2003  but  is \nconsistently the largest single item in the national budget. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

In 2003, the estimated population of the Kyrgyz Republic was 5.1 million, of whom 45% \nwere between 5 and 19 years of age and 70% lived in rural areas, where poverty is prevalent. \nGovernment\u2019s statistics indicate that, in 2003, 40% of the urban population and 47% of the rural \npopulation lived in poverty. The widening poverty gap significantly disadvantages children from \nrural areas in terms of access to basic education and its quality. \n \n7.  In SY2003, 97.8% of boys and 95.8% of girls of school age were enrolled in primary \nschools, for a gross enrollment rate of 96.8%. Lower secondary enrollment was 92.8% (92.6% \nof boys and 93.0% of girls). Upper secondary enrollment was 72.0% (68% of boys and 76.1% of \ngirls). \n \n8.  Commitment to improving both the quality and the effectiveness of education is a key \nelement of the Government's economic strategy. The overall development plans and strategies \nfor the education sector are reflected in the national Education Development Concept to the \nYear 2010.5 MOE emphasizes developing an education system that provides students with \nknowledge  and  skills  to  meet  the  demands  of  a  market-oriented  economy.  Despite  high \neducational attainment in the Kyrgyz Republic, with near universal literacy during the Soviet \nperiod,  the  education  system  currently  needs  considerable  investment  to  improve  quality, \naccess, and participation, and to help the country sustain its achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) for education. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Primary and General Secondary Education Subsector Issues \n \n9.  Need for a New Curriculum.6 Prior to independence, the curriculum was consistent with \nthat of the Soviet Union. Following independence, the Kyrgyz Republic revised the curriculum in \n1992. Notable among the many minor changes since 1992 are the introduction of foreign \nlanguages into primary school, the replacement of environmental studies with homeland studies \nand of Soviet history with that of the Kyrgyz Republic, and the introduction of information and \ncommunications technology (ICT) courses, as well as of ethics. A set of state educational \nstandards, developed in 1996 and subsequently revised in 2002 and 2004, are still in draft form \nawaiting the Government\u2019s consideration. The current curriculum comprises 24 subjects. While \nit differs somewhat from the old Soviet curriculum, particularly persistent is the tradition of \nheavily content-based subjects. \n \n10.  MOE is considering lengthening the general education system to 12 years from the \npresent 11 years and the question of whether the proposed additional year would follow the \nexisting 11 years or precede it as an additional preschool year. The need is urgent to introduce \na modern curriculum that not only reflects the national context of education but also ensures a \nstudent-centered approach, supported by modern learning materials and a modern learning-\nassessment system, and implemented by highly qualified educators. \n \n11.  Need for Textbooks and New Learning Materials. After independence, there was a \nmajor shortage of textbooks. The ESDP addressed the urgent need for textbooks by procuring \n3.35  million  copies  of  textbooks  and  teachers\u2019  guides  and  establishing  a  basis  for  the \n                                                 \n5  Ministry of Education and Culture of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2002. The National Education Development Concept to \nthe Year 2010. Bishkek  \n6  \u201cCurriculum\u201d as used here includes the overall aims of learning, general objectives by level of education, curriculum \nframework (subjects and hours by grade level), and subject curriculum (topics, detailed learning objectives, \nindicative teaching methods, and assessment methods).   ", "3 \ncompetitive  development  and  printing  of  textbooks.  However,  the  development  and \nimplementation  of  a  new  curriculum  requires  a  new  generation  of  textbooks  and  learning \nmaterials that reflect the new curriculum and provide a resource base for learning. Successfully \ndeveloping, publishing, and distributing new textbooks and learning materials requires several \neffort. At present, the Kyrgyz Academy of Education (KAE) is responsible for developing the \ncurriculum and textbooks and learning materials in all curriculum subjects, at all grades, in the \nfour  approved  languages  of  instruction;  generating  authors\u2019  manuscripts;  and  approving \ntextbooks and learning materials. This creates a conflict of interest and is not conducive to the \nrobust  and  effective  production  and  distribution  of  textbooks  and  learning  materials.  The \nGovernment urgently needs to separate these four functions. Improvements are required to \nattract  and  train  qualified  textbook  authors  drawn  from  a  pool  of  proficient  educators  that \nincludes current teachers and is not limited to academics who do not actively teach in schools. \nTraining is needed for curriculum developers and textbook authors to ensure better textbooks \nand learning materials that consistently reflect the revised curriculum. \n \n12.  The Government policy is to provide textbooks and learning materials to all students in \ngeneral education (grades 1\u201311) in the four approved languages of instruction: Kyrgyz, Russian, \nTajik, and Uzbek. Out of 1.144 million students enrolled in 2004, 716,572 use Kyrgyz as their \nlanguage of instruction, 273,223 use Russian, 151,163 use Uzbek, and only 3,078 use Tajik. \nMost of the materials in the Kyrgyz Republic have been translated from Russian, with the \nnotable exceptions of textbooks on the history and geography of the Kyrgyz Republic, which \nwere developed under the ESDP. In the years immediately following independence, textbooks \nin  Uzbek  and  Tajik  were  imported  from  Uzbekistan7  and  Tajikistan.  The  Osh  Center  of \nAdaptation of Textbooks in the Uzbek language was engaged under the ESDP to develop \ntextbooks for students studying in Uzbek in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n13.  Free distribution of textbooks to enrolled students was discontinued in 1994 due to \nsevere constraints on expenditures. In 1999, the Government, with support from the ESDP, \nintroduced a textbook rental scheme (TRS) to address the resulting problems of access to and \naffordability of textbooks, in particular for the poor. Under the TRS, textbooks are rented to \nstudents for Som15 ($0.37) per book per year in Bishkek city and Chui oblast, and for Som12 \n($0.29) elsewhere in the country, with a waiver of rental fees for students whose parents cannot \nafford to pay. The TRS is complex and needs reform to make it more effective. The World \nBank\u2019s Rural Education Project (REP)8 is supporting Government efforts to further refine the \nTRS and develop commercial textbook production initiated under the ESDP. It is envisaged that \na textbook approval board independent of KAE will be established under the REP. \n \n14.  Almost all schools in the country lack learning aids, including maps, didactic materials, \nscience models, and globes, as their provision has been discontinued since 1991 for lack of \nfunds. Several pilot schools received learning aids for science and language classes under the \nESDP, but unmet demand for learning aids remains high. \n \n15.  Need to Upgrade Learning Assessment. Few in the Kyrgyz Republic recognize the \nneed for different assessment strategies, their purpose, or how they can help improve students\u2019 \neducation. No clear assessment policy exists. Continuous assessment conducted in schools \nfocuses on developing retentive memories and measures the knowledge that the students have \n                                                 \n7  As Uzbekistan now uses the Roman alphabet, importing Uzbek learning materials is impossible because the \nKyrgyz Republic still uses the Cyrillic alphabet. In any case, textbooks and learning materials produced in \nUzbekistan neither meet the requirements of the national curriculum nor were written from the cultural and social \nperspective of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n8   World Bank. 2004. Rural Education Project. Washington, DC. \n ", "4 \nreceived. These assessments are mostly diagnostic in that they identify what the students are \nunable to do. Student grades are used to judge the quality of education provided by schools, so \nit is in the interest of the school management to ensure that all students receive passing grades. \nThis practice needs to be changed by upgrading teachers\u2019 classroom learning assessment skills \nand  providing  them  with  skills  for  a  student-centered,  active  learning  approach  and \nmethodology. \n \n16.  While  competent  academically,  teachers  have  little  knowledge  of  student-centered \nteaching methods. Teachers do not express dissatisfaction with traditional assessment systems \nand need to be convinced of the value of new methods, as well as provided with training support \nwhen shown new methods of classroom assessment. It will be a challenge for the Government \nto introduce new assessment methods, integrate them into a new curriculum, and facilitate \nacceptance. To ensure the institutionalization and sustainability of local capacity, programs in \neducation  assessment  are  needed  to  develop  expertise  at  in-service  teacher  training \ninstitutions. Initially, this will require external degree training for a selection of MOE staff as the \nbasis for strengthening in-country training. A public awareness campaign is needed to ensure \npublic  acceptance  and  stakeholder  understanding  of  the  new  curriculum  and  learning \nassessment system, and to ensure their successful implementation. \n \n17.  Weak Incentives for the Teaching Profession. The shortage of qualified teachers, \nparticularly in rural schools,  an aging teaching corps, and the inability of the education system \nto provide adequate in-service training are key constraints on improving the quality of education. \nAll three problems stem from insufficient funding, the resultant low salaries for teachers, and the \nconsequent declining incentives, morale, and motivation within the teaching profession. A large \nand increasing number of teachers are over the age of 45. Recruiting qualified new teachers to \nreplace retirees is proving difficult primarily due to very low salaries. Salaries for teachers and \nprincipals are usually well below the average monthly wage, and even the top monthly salary of \nSom9769 ($23.8) is below the poverty level of Som1,144 ($27.9) calculated using the minimum \nconsumer basket approach. Salary increases for teachers are critically important for improving \nteacher  morale  and  attracting  young  teachers,  particularly  to  schools  in  rural  areas.  The \nGovernment increased teachers\u2019 salaries by 15% in April 2004 and a further increase of almost \n15% was approved in October 2004, leading to a cumulative increase of 30% in 2004. However, \nteachers\u2019 salaries remain very low, and teachers are reluctant to undertake assignments in rural \nschools. Teachers also have little motivation to improve their performance, as doing so does not \nbring salary increases or other forms of professional recognition. A new promotion scheme \nbased on performance will be supported under the World Bank\u2019s REP. \n \n18.  Inadequate  Supply  of  Teachers.  The  distribution  of  teachers  is  uneven  both \ngeographically and by subject area. National statistics indicate sufficient teachers in primary \nschools. Overall student-teacher ratios were 15.7:1 in 2002 and 15.5:1 in 2003. Numbers range \nfrom 12.9:1 in Naryn oblast to 19.0:1 in Bishkek. Serious shortages of teachers affect schools in \npoorer and more remote raions. Teacher shortages by subject area occur at the secondary level \nbut not the primary level. A 2003 study conducted by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund \n(UNICEF)  found  that,  on  average,  half  of  the  needed  classes  in  mathematics,  chemistry, \ngeography, physics, biology, foreign languages, and ICT were not conducted due to teacher \nshortages in rural areas. Teacher shortages often arise from the inability of the education sector \nto compete with the private sector in attracting personnel with such skills. \n                                                 \n9  The public service salary scale has 23 levels from Som160 ($3.9) to Som1,280 ($31) per month. Teachers and \nprincipals fall in the range receiving Som720\u2013Som976 per month. World Bank. 2004. Report of the Teacher \nDevelopment Specialist. Washington, DC.    ", "5 \n19.  In 2004, 2,300 teachers graduated from pre-service teacher training institutions, but only \n1,050 new graduates entered the teaching profession. In the same year, the education system \nrequired 3,084 new teachers. Continued efforts are needed to make the teaching profession \nmore  attractive  by  improving  teachers\u2019  remuneration,  providing  support  through  various \nincentives, and upgrading teachers\u2019 qualifications and skills. Key issues for review include \nintroducing promotion based on performance rather than seniority, as well as incentives for new \ngraduates and current teachers to teach in rural areas. \n \n20.  Lack of In-Service Teacher Training. National coordination of teacher training is the \nresponsibility of the National Institute for Raising the Qualifications of Teachers and Teacher \nTraining (NTTI) under KAE. In oblasts, in-service teacher training is handled by a network of \nseven teacher training institutes (TTIs). MOE finances in-service training conducted by NTTI, \nwhile oblast in-service training is financed mainly through oblast administration budgets. In \nsome cases, there are limited fee-paying programs. In other cases, oblast governments pay the \ntraining cost by allocating funds directly to TTIs, but travel, subsistence, and accommodation \nexpenses are paid by the teachers themselves. Rural teachers cannot meet such expenses \nfrom a monthly salary of about $19 equivalent. The ESDP addressed the most urgent need for \nteacher  training  by  training  7,000  teachers  nationwide  but  did  not  address  the  need  to \nstrengthen the capacity of TTIs. Due to budget constraints, oblasts have had limited funds to \nequip TTIs, which struggle to support adequate in-service teacher training. At all oblast TTIs, \nICT training facilities and language laboratories are poorly equipped or nonexistent. TTIs in \nBishkek are only marginally better equipped. Urgent support is needed for TTIs in all oblasts. \n \n21.  Inadequate Access and Participation in Rural Schools. Despite recent progress, \naccess  to and  participation  in  education  remains  a  problem,  particularly  in  rural  areas.  In \nSY2004, the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s 1,694 rural schools (82% of all schools in the country) served \n816,337 students (70% of all students). The enrollment rate in general education rose from \n86.9% in 1998 to 90.6% in 2002, but in primary schools enrollment declined from 98.7% to \n96.8% in the same period. The drop was steepest for boys, from 98.1% to 95.8%. Rates for \ngrades 5\u20139 rose from 82.6% to 92.8%, and for grades 10\u201311 from 70.6% to 72.0%. \n \n22.  MOE statistics indicate that the total number of children not attending school declined \nfrom 3,516 in SY2001 to 1,344 in SY2004. However, many enrolled students do not attend \nschool for extended periods. A study conducted by UNICEF10 in 1999 indicates that this is \nparticularly true for students in poor, remote, and mountainous areas. Declining attendance \nrates can, like the poor quality of education, be attributed to the inferior condition of schools and \nlack of learning materials, aids, and equipment. In addition, children from poor families drop out \nof school in grade 7 or 8 to help support to the household. These hidden dropouts from the \nsystem reflect serious participation and efficiency problems. \n \n2.  Project Rationale \n \n23.  The Project will build on the achievements of the ESDP, the first external assistance \nprovided to the Government in the education sector. The ESDP addressed priority needs by \nhelping the Government implement (i) urgent policy reforms in education finance through TRS \nand other policy actions,  (ii) policy planning by rationalizing MOE staffing and enhancing sector \nmanagement to improve its efficiency, (iii) a policy framework to tackle immediate issues of \nquality  and  relevance  in  basic  education  by  allowing  private  sector  participation  in  the \n                                                 \n10 UNICEF and Center for Public Opinion Studies and Forecast. 2003. Monitoring of Learning Achievement II (8 \nGrade). Bishkek. \n ", "6 \nproduction of textbooks, and (iv) a social sector assistance mechanism to help poor families \nenroll their children in basic and early childhood education. The ESDP\u2019s capacity development \nstrengthened  MOE\u2019s  capability  to  implement  externally  funded  projects.  Key  investment \nactivities focused on (i) providing 3.35 million textbooks, (ii) developing a few new textbook \ntitles,  (iii)  providing  library  materials,  (iv)  training  over  7,000  teachers  and  306  school \nadministrative staff, and (v) upgrading the deteriorated facilities of 192 schools. An education \nmanagement information system (EMIS) was established and is fully operational. \n \n24.  The Project will build on the ESDP\u2019s achievements and focus on (i) modernizing the \ncurriculum, developing learning materials for the new curriculum, and modernizing learning \nassessment to promote a student-centered teaching process; (ii) comprehensively supporting \nteachers and school principals by strengthening in-service teacher training and incentives, in \nparticular to attract teachers to rural areas; and (iii) upgrading schools in rural and poor areas by \nrehabilitating facilities and providing equipment and learning aids. \n \n25.  The Project is designed to target poor communities by expanding and ensuring their \naccess to education, particularly for children from poor families in rural areas. Nationwide, the \nProject  will  bring  about  changes  to  improve  the  quality  of  education  and  assist  the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to sustain the achievement of education MDGs. The sustainability of \nproject achievements will be ensured through broad stakeholder participation from all levels of \ngovernment, local communities, the private sector, donors, and nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs). \n \n  3.  Lessons Learned \n \n26.  The  project  design  takes  into  consideration  experience  gained  in  implementing  the \nESDP and the Social Services Delivery and Finance Project.11 The ESDP was initially impeded \nby MOE counterparts\u2019 and project staff members\u2019 unfamiliarity with ADB operational procedures \nand guidelines. It was impeded throughout by the high turnover of counterpart and project staff, \nincluding frequent changes of project manager. Experience gained under ESDP and the Social \nServices Delivery and Finance Project highlighted the importance of staff continuity to ensure \nsustainable capacity building and effective implementation. \n \n27.  A second lesson learned relates to the importance of coordinating with other donors \nactive in the education sector. Stronger donor coordination and information sharing in future \nprojects should be assured through various interagency mechanisms, including the International \nAdvisory Council on Education,12 established in 2003 by MOE and including all donors working \nin the country\u2019s education sector. \n \n28.  Declining enrollment and attendance rates and the poor quality of education can be \nattributed in part to the poor condition of school buildings and facilities. The ESDP focused on \nrehabilitating heating systems, which was justified given the condition of schools and resource \nconstraints prevailing when the ESDP was appraised. However, the experience highlighted the \nimportance of a more comprehensive approach to school rehabilitation (insulation of windows, \nroof and floor repair, and sanitation improvements) to ensure an improved learning environment, \nextended school lifespan and reduced O&M costs. Further lessons learned from the ESDP are \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 1998.

Government Policy \n \n29.  The  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  for  2003\u20132005  is  a  medium-term  plan  to \nimplement the country development framework until 2010. It was prepared by the Government, \nin close consultation with civil society, as a framework for development. Both the strategy and \nthe  framework  identify  poverty  reduction  as  the  overarching  objective  and  emphasize \nparticipation and access to education as a priority toward reducing poverty. The Medium-Term \nBudget  Framework  (2005\u20132007)13  sets  out  parameters  for  midterm  annual  budgets  and \nindicates that the education sector is one of four priority sectors. \n \n30.  The Law on Education, the Education Development Concept until 2010, and the National \nAction Plan on Education for All define the framework for the Government\u2019s policy and strategy \nin  developing  education  and  set  goals.  The  Law  on  Education  was  adopted  in  2003  and \nmandates  primary  and  secondary  education  for  all  citizens.  The  National  Action  Plan  on \nEducation for All includes primary and secondary education and aims to ensure universal \nenrollment by encouraging students not to drop out, promoting inclusion, fostering innovation, \nimproving  the  curriculum  and  textbooks,  upgrading  facilities  and  equipment,  strengthening \ncommunity  and  parental  participation,  improving  assessment,  and  introducing  certification \nsystems. \n \n5.  External Assistance to the Sector \n \n31.  ADB has been the primary source of external support for the education sector since the \nmid-1990s. Assistance has included program and project loans for the ESDP (footnote 2), \napproved in 1997 with cofinancing from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries\u2019 \nOPEC Fund for International Development, which supported the Government\u2019s policy reforms \nand initial improvements in delivering education. The Social Services Development and Finance \nProject,14 which was approved in 1998, provided support for rehabilitating education and health \nfacilities in Jalal-Abad and Osh oblasts. The Community-Based Early Childhood Development \nProject,15 which was approved in 2003, focuses on improving health, nutrition, and educational \ndevelopment for children between birth and 8 years of age in the 12 poorest raions of the \ncountry. External assistance to the sector is reported in Appendix 4. \n \n32.  The World Bank designed its REP (footnote 8) in close coordination with ADB and used \nthe findings of ADB\u2019s feasibility study for the Project. The REP was approved in 2004 and aims \nto (i) improve teacher incentives, including the development of a performance-based promotion \nsystem and fellowships to attract new teachers; (ii) provide school grants for improved learning \nin the pilot oblasts of Issyk-Kul and Talas; (iii) revise the TRS and reprint textbooks and learning \nmaterials to cover the immediate needs of primary and lower secondary schools; and (iv) \ndevelop sample-based national student assessment. The Project has been prepared in close \ncoordination with the World Bank\u2019s REP and other donors active in the education sector. \n                                                 \n13 Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2004.

Other  external  assistance  includes  the  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment\u2019s  (USAID)  assistance  to  curriculum  adjustment  in  a  democratic  context, \nstrengthening education financing and management, voucher-based in-service teacher training, \na post-secondary national scholastic test, and minor school improvement in cooperation with its \npartners. UNICEF and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization \n(UNESCO) have supported studies of learning achievement by students finishing grade 4 and \ngrade  8.  A  matrix  on  activity  coordination  among  the  Project;  the  REP;  and  USAID\u2019s \nParticipation, Education, and Knowledge Strengthening Project is in Supplementary Appendix \nA. \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n \n34.  ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132006) highlights the importance of \nrestoring  universal  access  to  basic  education  and  prioritizes  strengthening  the  education \nsector\u2019s quality and financial sustainability and improving access for children from poor families. \nThe Project\u2019s focus is fully consistent with ADB\u2019s Policy on Education.16 Its activities are based \non  framework  priorities  to  reduce  poverty,  enhance  the  status  of  women,  and  provide \nknowledge and skills essential for pro-poor economic growth and sustainability. The Project \nbuilds on the initial policy reforms and sector investments carried out under the ESDP. The \nProject will recommend approaches to improve the quality of education and children\u2019s access to \nit, as well as strengthening management. Within this framework, it will support improvements in \nthe delivery of education to children in both rural and urban areas, with particular attention to \npoor areas and children from disadvantage families. The Project will assist the Government to \nsustain achievements relevant to the education MDGs. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n35.  The impact of the Project will be a general education system responsive to the needs of \na modern market-oriented economy and focused on poorer areas. The outcomes of the Project \nare increased enrollment in primary and general secondary education in poorer areas of the \ncountry and student performance raised. \n \nB.  Outputs \n36.  The  Project  has  three  components:  (i)  modernizing  the  curriculum  and  learning \nassessment, (ii) strengthening the teaching profession, and (iii) improving participation and \nquality in rural schools. \n \n1.  Modernizing the Curriculum and Learning Assessment \n \n37.  The Project will support MOE and KAE in developing a new curriculum (footnote 6) and \nmodernizing learning assessment system. This component aims to improve the quality of basic \neducation in support of the Government\u2019s Education Development Concept to the Year 2010. \nThis component has three subcomponents: (i) modernizing the curriculum and developing new \nlearning materials, (ii) modernizing learning assessment, and (iii) raising public awareness on \nthe new curriculum and learning assessment. \n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2002. Policy on Education. Manila.. ", "9 \n38.  Modernizing  the  Curriculum  and  Developing  New  Learning  Materials.  This \nsubcomponent will focus on developing a curriculum that supports improving students\u2019 higher-\norder cognitive and problem-solving skills through a student-centered learning process. The \nnational curriculum framework will be developed and ensure a new curriculum for all subject \nareas for all grades. The Project will support the phased development of textbooks and learning \nmaterials for grades 1\u20135, 6\u20139, and 10\u201311 or 12. In the context of the Government\u2019s program for \ndeveloping new learning materials, the Project will provide support to develop, produce, and \nsupply at least 670,000 copies of a new generation of textbooks and at least 61,000 teacher \nguides to cover primary school. \n \n39.  Capacity will be built throughout the education system to ensure the Government\u2019s \ncontinued and complete provision of required textbooks and learning materials for all other \ngrades.  Twelve  subject  specialists  and  two  senior  education  officials  will  receive  external \ntraining in curriculum development and learning assessment before the national curriculum \nframework is developed. These 14 specialists, together with another 14 specialists in textbook \nand learning materials development, will form a core group to develop the new curriculum, \ntextbooks,  learning  materials,  and  learning  assessment  system.  The  core  group  will  also \nmonitor testing, the trial of the new curriculum, and new textbook production. It will make \nnecessary  adjustments  jointly  with  curriculum  developers  and  textbook  authors.  In-country \ntraining for 150 trainers will be conducted by international and domestic consultants to enable \nthe trainers to train teachers to implement the new curriculum, use the new learning materials, \nand manage assessment in schools. Training will be carried out in the school year prior to the \nintroduction of the new curriculum and learning materials. The system and standards of learning \naids provision will be reviewed in coordination with other donors. \n \n40.  Prior to the development of the new curriculum, a series of policy studies on related \neducational  issues  will  be  conducted,  including,  for  Government  consideration,  a  detailed \nassessment with outlined recommendations and an action plan for implementing a 12-year \nsystem of education. The policy studies, which are outlined in Supplementary Appendix B, will \nhelp MOE implement its overall education strategy and the Education Development Concept to \nthe Year 2010. \n \n41.  All activities for developing the new curriculum and learning assessment will stress wide \nstakeholder participation including (i) developing sessions, (ii) nationwide discussion workshops, \n(iii) revision, (iv) training for implementing activities at a 2-day national seminar for 100 senior \neducators  followed  by  a  1-week  workshop  for  up  to  20  people  in  each  raion,  and  (v)  a \nnationwide public awareness campaign (para. 44).  \n \n42.  Modernizing Learning Assessment. With support from the Project, the Government \naims to train teachers, educators, and education sector managers to be reflective practitioners \nable to engage in ongoing inquiry to improve the quality of education. The purpose of this \nsubcomponent is to strengthen the relationship between curriculum and learning assessment, \nand to introduce and implement a new concept of assessment. This subcomponent will focus on \ndeveloping  and  implementing,  for  each  grade,  a  clear  policy,  assessment  standards,  and \nregulations on formative and summative classroom assessment systems. \n \n43.  Training to develop learning assessment will be closely linked with activities toward \ncurriculum development. About 12 subject specialists and two senior education officials will be \ntrained in learning assessment and formulate a new learning assessment system. They will be \npart of the core group developing the new curriculum, textbooks and learning materials, and \nlearning assessment system. About 288 trainers will receive training to enable them to train \n ", "10 \nteachers to use the new curriculum and learning assessment system. A report and system for \nanalyzing examinations and student results will be developed under the existing education \ninformation management system at MOE. Monitoring and evaluation activities will be conducted \nto assess the impact and effectiveness of the new curriculum and learning materials and the \nquality of assessment centrally and regionally. The Project will institutionalize the new learning \nassessment system by supporting TTIs\u2019 institutional capacity and providing two TTI specialists \nwith an opportunity to study overseas and obtain a master\u2019s degree in learning assessment. \nThese specialists will establish the new learning assessment program at the TTIs upon their \nreturn,  training  21  secondary  school  teachers  by  the  end  of  the  Project.  To  ensure \nunderstanding of new assessment techniques, 4,000 teachers and 2,000 school principals and \nrepresentatives of TTIs will participate in a 2-week training program on learning assessment \nmethods  and  techniques.  International  and  domestic  consultants  will  help  develop  training \nmaterials in formative and summative assessment. \n \n44.  Raising Public Awareness on the New Curriculum and Learning Assessment . This \nsubcomponent  will  help  the  Government  ensure  successful  implementation  of  the  new \ncurriculum  and  learning  assessment  system.  The  Project  will  conduct  public  awareness \ncampaigns to support public acceptance and stakeholder understanding of the new curriculum, \ntextbooks,  learning  materials,  learning  assessment,  and  teacher  incentives,  including \nparticipatory  forums  and  dissemination  of  multimedia  programs  and  materials.  Local \ncommunities and NGOs will be encouraged to take part in these programs. Advocacy programs \non inclusive education will also be conducted. Teachers involved in the resulting inclusive \neducation activities will attend training programs at the TTI chosen to be the training center for \ninclusive education. \n \n2.  Strengthening the Teaching Profession \n45.  This  component  will  build  on  initial  measures  under  the  ESDP  to  support  teacher \ndevelopment. It has two subcomponents: (i) strengthening in-service teacher training and (ii) \nproviding incentives for rural teachers. \n \n46.  Strengthening In-Service Teacher Training. This subcomponent will strengthen the in-\nservice training of teachers and principals toward implementing the new curriculum, textbooks \nand  learning  materials,  and  learning  assessment  systems,  as  well  as  upgrade  teachers\u2019 \nprofessional skills. The Project will strengthen the capacity of NTTI at KAE, which serves as a \nnational  center  for  in-service  teacher  training  and  trains  school  teachers  and  principals  in \nBishkek, Chui, and Naryn oblasts. The Project will also strengthen the capacity of seven TTIs to \ndeliver professional in-service training for teachers and school principals in all other oblasts. \n \n47.  The Project will provide NTTI and each of the seven TTIs with a computer-equipped \nclassroom and a language laboratory, as well as with classroom furniture and teaching and \nlearning materials. The Project will train teacher trainers and support the development of in-\nservice  training  programs  for  teachers  and  education  sector  managers  regarding  new \ncurriculum  and  learning  materials,  classroom  assessment,  performance  management, \nmentoring  of  newly  qualified  teachers,  resource  management,  and  library  management. \nSeventy-one oblast education specialists will be trained in group facilitation skills. \n \n48.  Providing Incentives for Rural Teachers. This subcomponent will support Government \nefforts to strengthen the teaching profession and enhance and expand the teaching corps, \nespecially in rural schools, through a pilot incentive scheme. The Project will support a rural ", "11 \nteacher incentive scheme17 (RTIS) designed to attract and retain teachers in rural schools. The \nProject will provide incentives for at least 300 teachers, including newly graduated teachers, \nwho will be assigned to rural schools. Teachers of key subjects, and those in schools with an \noversupply of teachers, will be redeployed to rural schools for 3 years on a pilot basis. The \nincentive under the RTIS will be at least Som2,000 ($48.8) per month per teacher deposited in a \ndesignated bank for the 3 years. Each teacher will receive the accumulated incentive with \ninterest upon completion of the teaching contract. To qualify for selection, rural schools must (i) \nhave a shortage of teachers in key subjects, (ii) serve a large number of rural children, and (iii) \nbe located in a remote area. Newly graduated and current teachers applying for the incentives \nmust agree to teach in a rural area and have high qualifications in the required subject area. \nImplementation of the incentive scheme will be reviewed periodically, and the Government will \nconsider its continuation upon completion of the pilot stage. \n \n3.  Improving Participation and Quality in Rural Schools \n49.  This component will help MOE improve participation and the quality of education in \nselected rural schools. Ninety schools have been identified for comprehensive rehabilitation by \nMOE  in  close  consultation  with  oblast  and  raion  departments  of  education  and  other \nstakeholders.  The  list  of  schools  for  rehabilitation  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  Their \nselection is based on the following criteria: \n  \n(i)   the school is located in a poor, rural area;  \n(ii)   the school\u2019s foundation, walls, and load-bearing structures are sound and can \nfeasibly be rehabilitated;  \n(iii)   school staff and community members are committed to improving the school; and \n(iv)  oblast and raion administrations commit to budgeting for incremental O&M costs \nduring the Project and following completion of rehabilitation. \n \n50.  The Project will rehabilitate and upgrade school facilities and infrastructure by repairing \nheating systems and electrical wiring, insulating windows, repairing floors and roofs, improving \nsanitation, and providing access for handicapped students. The Project will provide the schools \nwith classroom and library furniture, a computer classroom with 13 computers, a language \nlaboratory with 15 stations, audiovisual equipment, and learning aids. \n \n51.  This component also includes project management activities through the CPIU and the \nRPIUs. To ensure the quality of the school rehabilitation, a project engineer at each of the two \nRPIUs  will  oversee  the  Project\u2019s  civil  works  implementation  (para.58).  Raion  and  oblast \narchitects  will  be  employed  to  prepare  designs  and  help  prepare  tender  documents  in \ncooperation with the school community, local administration, and project civil engineer. Schools \nselected for rehabilitation will not require additional land or an environmental impact study, as \nno environmental impact is envisaged. \n \nC.  Special Features \n52.  Pro-Poor Design. The Project is designed to improve the learning environment for \nstudents in rural areas, where poverty is prevalent. This will be done by comprehensively \nrehabilitating the schools most in need. Support will be provided to a mechanism for attracting \nteachers to rural schools and to nationwide activities fostering inclusive education. Learning \n                                                 \n17 Under the RTIS, the Government will support 200 teachers annually; the World Bank\u2019s Rural Education Project will \nsupport 300 teachers. \n ", "12 \nmaterials,  including  textbooks,  will  be  provided  nationwide  under  the  TRS,  which  includes \nprovisions to ensure affordability and the full provision of textbooks to children whose families \ncannot afford to pay. \n \n53.  Institutional  Changes  and  Decentralization.  The  Project  will  support  the \ndecentralization of in-service teacher training by strengthening oblast TTIs with training and new \nequipment. In-service teacher training will be demand driven. \n \n54.  Participatory Approach and Community Involvement. The Project was designed with \nthe  participation  of  key  policy  makers,  central  and  local  government  authorities,  teachers, \nparents,  students,  aiyl  okmotu  (village  authority)  representatives,  and  private  publishers. \nPreliminary and in-depth assessments and situation analyses were conducted centrally and in \noblasts, raions, and villages. These included regular stakeholder consultations, workshops, and \npresentations. During implementation, the Project will maintain broad stakeholder participation, \nincluding community participation in the public awareness campaign, facility improvement, and \nresults monitoring. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n55.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $21.85 million equivalent, including physical \nand price contingencies, taxes and duties.

The Government has requested a grant of $15.50 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources to finance 71% of project costs, including 100% of the foreign exchange cost and \n69% of the local currency cost. The remaining $6.35 million equivalent, or 29% of the total \nproject cost, will be provided by the Government. The financing plan is in Table 2, and details of \nthe financing plan are in Appendix 6. Grant financing for the Project is considered justified \nbecause of its focus on basic (primary and secondary) education, and the fact that a significant \npart of the investment targets poor and remote areas. The Kyrgyz Republic is eligible for Asian \nDevelopment Fund grant financing up to 50% of its total Asian Development Fund allocation. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nForeign   Local   Total  \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Costa  Percent \nAsian Development Bank              4.78            10.72             15.50              71  \nGovernment              0.00              6.35               6.35              29  \n                                Total              4.78            17.07             21.85            100  \na The allocation of grant proceeds in the Grant Agreement will be presented in $, with reference only to total \nexpenditure, in accordance with the policy on Cost Sharing and Eligibility of Expenditure for Asian Development \nBank Financing: A New Approach. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n57.  The project Executing Agency will be MOE. A national project steering council will be \nestablished and chaired by the vice prime minister responsible for social sectors. It will include \nrepresentatives from MOE, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, President\u2019s \nAdministration, Prime Minister\u2019s Office, and Parliamentary Committee on Education. The council \nwill meet quarterly or, if required, more often. It will provide overall strategic guidance, monitor \nimplementation of the Project and World Bank\u2019s REP, and ensure donor coordination. The first \ndeputy minister of MOE will be the project director, who will coordinate overall implementation of \nproject activities. Two regional project steering councils will be established to guide and monitor \nimplementation of the project activities in the oblasts. \n \n58.  A  CPIU  will  be  established  at  MOE  in  Bishkek  to  coordinate  the  day-to-day \nimplementation of project activities. It will be staffed by domestic consultants including a project \nmanager, procurement specialist, finance manager, accountant, administrative assistant, and \ninterpreter.  It  will  be  assisted  by  domestic  consultants  on  teacher  training  and  learning \nmaterials, curriculum and learning assessment, monitoring and evaluation, and civil works and \nequipment,  and  translation.  The  CPIU  will  be  responsible  for  project  activities  overall  and \ndirectly responsible for implementing activities in Chui and Talas oblasts. Two RPIUs will be \nestablished at oblast departments of education and will be responsible for implementing project \nactivities in the other oblasts, one RPIU covering the southern oblasts of Osh, Jalal-Abad, and \nBatken, and the other covering Naryn and Issyk-Kul. The two RPIUs will each be staffed with \ndomestic consultants including a coordinator, accountant, assistant, civil works and equipment \nspecialist, and driver. The Project will cover consultants\u2019 salaries and office equipment and \noperational costs. The two RPIU coordinators will report directly to the project manager in the \n ", "14 \nCPIU, providing quarterly and annual progress reports. The RPIU offices will be located in the \nOsh  and  Karakol  oblast  education  departments.  The  project  management  structure  is  in \nAppendix 7. \n \n59.  The Project and the World Bank\u2019s REP have been prepared in close cooperation, are \nmutually complementary and will coordinate closely on sector policy issues as well as project \nimplementation. Each project will begin with administratively separate project implementation \nunits, each with its own staff headed by a project manager. The national project director and \nnational project steering council will ensure policy coordination. The scope for closer integration \nwill be reviewed within one year of project implementation. The two project offices with be \nlocated near each other at MOE to ensure close coordination and information sharing, and a \nunified salary scale for unit staff will be agreed. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n60.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years, from January 2006 to December 2010. A \nproject implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n  3.  Procurement \n \n61.  All ADB-financed civil works, goods, and services will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works will include the rehabilitation of existing facilities \nbut no new construction. As civil works contracts will be small and scattered, each contract is \nestimated to cost much less than $1 million. As domestic contractors are capable of carrying out \nsuch works, civil works contracts estimated to cost $1 million or less will be procured through \nlocal competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n62.  Equipment for computer classrooms and language laboratories, audiovisual equipment, \nand  classroom  furniture,  as  well  as  textbooks  and  learning  materials,  will  be  provided  to \nschools, NTTI, and TTIs. Equipment and goods estimated to cost more than $500,000 will be \nprocured  under  the  international  competitive  bidding  procedure.  Equipment  and  goods \nestimated to cost $500,000 or less will be procured under local competitive bidding procedures \nacceptable to ADB\u2014except for equipment and goods valued at $100,000 or less, which will be \nprocured by direct purchase. Indicative procurement packages are in Appendix 9. \n \n  4.  Consulting Services \n \n63.  A total of 81 person-months of international consulting services and 791 person-months \nof domestic consulting services will be contracted, including 600 person-months of domestic \nconsultants for CPIU and RPIU. These will include experts in policy research and evaluation, \ncurriculum and learning materials design, learning assessment, teacher training, procurement, \nfinance, civil engineering, project management, accounting, monitoring and evaluation, and \ntranslation. The domestic consultants for the CPIU and RPIUs will be recruited as individuals, \nand all other consultants will be recruited as firms in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. Quality and cost-based selection, with simplified technical proposals, will be applied \nto consulting firms. Consulting services and outline terms of reference are in Appendix 10. \n \n \n \n ", "15 \n  5.  Staff Development and Training \n \n64.  The Project will provide extensive in-country and external training to upgrade the skills \nand knowledge of teachers, principals, and education administrators. The CPIU will prepare the \nselection criteria for training candidates within 6 months of project effectiveness, for approval by \nADB. Subsequently, the CPIU will provide ADB with (i) a list of the nominated candidates, (ii) \nproposed institutions, and (iii) detailed costing of the proposed courses. The external training \nprovider will be selected based on the competitive submission of training proposals. In-country \ntraining will be held at TTIs or other relevant training institutions selected on a competitive basis. \nEducation specialists selected for training overseas will have current teaching experience in \nschools. The staff development program is in Appendix 11. \n \n  6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n65.  The proposed grant will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook. An imprest account will be established to expedite disbursement of grant proceeds. \nThe  CPIU  will  open  the  account  in  a  commercial  bank  selected  by  the  Government  and \nacceptable to ADB. The Government may make withdrawals from the imprest account for CPIU \nand  regional  staff  costs;  training,  seminars,  and  studies;  locally  available  equipment  and \nmaterials; domestic consultants; and civil works contracts under local competitive bidding. The \ninitial amount to be deposited in the imprest account will not exceed $500,000. ADB\u2019s statement \nof expenditure procedures will be followed to liquidate the imprest account and reimburse \nindividual payments that do not exceed $50,000. \n \n7.  Advance Action and Retroactive Financing \n66.  The Government has requested advance procurement action and retroactive financing \nfor the CPIU\u2019s office equipment and a vehicle, office equipment for the curriculum writing \ngroups, and the recruitment of CPIU and RPIUs staff, including a project manager, finance \nmanager, accountant, and procurement specialist. This was approved in principle by ADB \nmanagement. The advance action will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. Retroactive financing will apply to expenses incurred after appraisal of the Project \nuntil the date the grant becomes effective and for an amount not exceeding $100,000. The \nGovernment was advised that ADB\u2019s approval of advance action and retroactive financing does \nnot commit ADB to financing the Project. Accumulated experience in implementing the ESDP \ndemonstrates MOE\u2019s proven competence and capacity to carry out procurement effectively.   \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n67.  MOE will maintain the project account and prepare financial statements according to \ninternational accounting standards. MOE will have the project account and related financial \nstatements  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  with  adequate \nqualification, knowledge, and experience in international accounting practices. Certified copies \nof the audited project accounts and audited financial statements will be submitted to ADB in \nEnglish by 6 months after the end of each financial year. A separate opinion on the use of the \nimprest account and statement of expenditures should be incorporated in the audited reports. \nThe Government has been advised of ADB\u2019s requirement for the timely submission of audited \nproject accounts and financial statements, including the suspension of disbursements in case of \nnoncompliance. \n \n ", "16 \n68.  MOE will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly reports, in English and in a format \nacceptable to ADB, on progress made and problems encountered during the period under \nreview; the steps taken or proposed to remedy these problems; and the proposed activities and \nexpected progress during the following period. Within 3 months of completion of the Project, the \nCPIU  will  submit  a  project  completion  report  to  ADB  that  will  provide  details  about \nimplementation, costs, benefits, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n69.  In  addition  to  targets  specified  in  the  project  design  and  monitoring  framework, \nsystematic  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  developed  and  undertaken  during  project \nimplementation. MOE and ADB agreed on a set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating \nproject performance regarding impact, outcome, and outputs. The project monitoring indicators \nare  in  Appendix  12.  The  baseline  values  of  the  indicators  will  be  established  prior  to \nimplementation. Monitoring indicators will be measured with the necessary frequency during \nproject implementation. Comments and findings on these indicators will be incorporated in the \nquarterly report to ADB. In addition to indicators for monitoring implementation, indicators for \nproject evaluation will be measured at project completion and 3 years after completion. Where \nfeasible and appropriate, these data should be disaggregated by gender. At project inception, \ncompletion, and 3 years after completion, MOE will submit to ADB a report that summarizes the \nkey findings of monitoring and evaluation of changes that occurred in the 3 preceding years. \n \n10.  Project Review \n70.  ADB and the Government will jointly review project implementation semiannually. The \nreviews  will  assess  progress  under  each  component,  identify  issues  and  constraints,  and \ndetermine necessary remedial action and adjustments. A comprehensive midterm review of \nproject performance will be conducted at the end of the third year of implementation. The \nmidterm review will (i) review the scope, design, and implementation arrangements; (ii) identify \nany changes required since the time of the project appraisal; (iii) assess the progress of project \nimplementation against performance indicators; (iv) establish compliance with grant covenants; \nand (v) recommend changes, if necessary, to design or implementation arrangements. \n \n11.  Anticorruption Measures \n71.  ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy has been explained to Government officials and highlighted \nparas.  1.06\u201310.8  of  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  on  issues  concerning  fraud  and \ncorruption.  The  Government  is  committed  to  creating  and  sustaining  a  corruption-free \nenvironment and agreed to include the relevant sections of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy in all \ndocuments and contracts during bidding for and implementation of the Project. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits and Beneficiaries \n \n72.  Project Beneficiaries. The direct beneficiaries of the Project will be 50,000 students \nand 1,500 teachers and school administrators in the 90 priority schools selected, most of them \nin rural communities. About 60% of students in the selected schools hold social passports that \nindicate that they come from poor families. These schools will benefit from the comprehensive \nrehabilitation of facilities and the provision of educational equipment, furniture and learning \nmaterials, which will create a significantly improved learning environment. ", "17 \n73.  Teachers  throughout  the  country  will  benefit  from  measures  to  make  the  teaching \nprofession more attractive, including in-service teacher training programs provided to 16,000 \nteachers and 6,000 school directors on the new curriculum, learning assessment system, and \ntextbooks, as well as the professional skills needed to improve the overall quality of teaching \nand school administration. The education staff at TTIs throughout the country will benefit from \ntheir enhanced capacity and upgraded teaching facilities. \n \n74.  About 1.2 million students nationwide will benefit from the improved curriculum, learning \nassessment system, and textbooks and learning materials, as well as from having better-skilled \nteachers. These benefits will help students prepare for pursuing further education, which will \nenhance their potential for securing viable employment and enhance their future income-earning \npotential. \n \n75.  Educational Benefits. Benefits will include an overall improvement in the quality of \neducation offered in terms of teaching and learning standards. The new curriculum and learning \nassessment system will help equip a new generation of workforce entrants with the knowledge \nand skills needed in a market economy. Best practices in curriculum and learning assessment \nsystems, and the introduction of innovative methods for improving the delivery of education \nservices based at the TTIs, will be institutionalized to ensure the sustained impact of project \noutputs. \n \n76.  Incentives to teach in rural areas will address a key bottleneck in teacher supply and \nhelp to ensure that subjects are taught in rural schools. The provision of computer classrooms, \nlanguage laboratory equipment, and furniture to rural schools will improve the learning process \nand environment and contribute to improving students\u2019 achievements.  \n \n77.  Poverty and Gender Impact. The Project is classified as a targeted intervention, as \napproximately 60% of the project beneficiaries are poor, reflecting a poverty rate higher than the \n40% of the country as a whole. The Project will directly and indirectly benefit students from poor \nfamilies, including children with disabilities. It will increase access to education in areas with the \nlow enrollment rates, particularly rural areas. The benefits of the Project will include improved \naccess to education for disadvantaged rural students. As 90% of teachers are female, the \nProject will directly benefit female teachers in rural areas by enhancing the incentives and \nattractiveness of the teaching profession. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is \nin Appendix 13. \n \n78.  Environmental and Social Safeguards. The Project will entail modest rehabilitation of \nschool facilities and internal refurbishing, with no environmental or resettlement impact. The \nProject will enhance access and equity for ethnic minorities by providing, in addition to textbook \nand learning materials in Kyrgyz and Russian, textbooks and learning materials in Uzbek and \nTajik. \n \n79.  Economic and Financial Sustainability. Finance data from a survey of 140 priority \nschools conducted in 2004 indicated that 25% of the schools\u2019 recurrent budgets was spent on \nutilities and 7.5% on O&M. On average, the cost of utilities and O&M is Som278,000 ($6,620) \nper school, which is high considering the limited budgetary resources of the schools.  \n \n80.  The  Project  will  enhance  efficiency  in  school  management  by  reducing  the cost  of \nutilities and O&M, which account for a third of the recurrent expenditures in individual schools. \nBy  rehabilitating  heating  systems;  repairing  roofs,  floors,  and  water-supply  systems;  and \ninsulating windows, the Project aims to achieve significant reductions in O&M costs per student. \n ", "18 \nUnder the ESDP, savings in O&M costs of up to 53% annually were achieved as a result of \nschool rehabilitation, particularly of heating systems. Based on this figure, by 2009, the Project\u2019s \ninvestments in the 90 schools are expected to reduce school annual expenditures by over \nSom11.4 million ($272,000 equivalent) yearly. The sustainability of the school rehabilitation will \nbe  ensured  by  continuous  community  involvement  in  maintaining  and  supporting  school \ninfrastructure. Economic and financial sustainability is analyzed in Appendix 14. \n \nB.  Risks \n \n81.  Implementation Capacity Risk. The risk exists that responsibilities or tasks required \ncentrally and/or in oblasts and raions will be beyond the capabilities of the staff members to \nwhich  they  have  been  assigned,  including  (i)  designing  school  facilities;  (ii)  supervising \nconstruction;  (iii)  procuring  and  delivering  equipment,  furniture,  and  learning  materials; \n(iv) policy studies; (v) designing the curriculum and learning materials; and (vi) designing and \ndelivering in-service training. The risks will be mitigated by training and capacity building of the \nresponsible staff at a central, oblast, and raion levels. \n \n82.  Sector Policy Risk. Policy impact will be significant with the introduction of a new \ncurriculum and learning assessment system reflecting the Government\u2019s priority to improve \naccess to, and the quality of education and consideration to introduce a 12-year system of \neducation. Risks include resistance from decision makers to recommended policy or legislative \nchanges, and from parents or the community at large to new and unfamiliar innovations in the \ncurriculum  and  learning  assessment  system.  Overall,  the  Government  is  consistent  in  its \nstrategy on educational reforms and enhancing access to education and its quality. The risk will \nbe  mitigated  by  adopting  a  stakeholder  participatory  approach  and  implementing  a  public \nawareness campaign that includes the active involvement of local communities and NGOs. \n \n83.  Financial Sustainability Risk. Financial risk arises from the possible inability of national \nor local government to provide the counterpart resources required to ensure effective project \nimplementation, or to provide for incremental recurrent costs for O&M during implementation \nand after project completion. The risk may lead to (i) deteriorated facilities due to lack of \nmaintenance  and  (ii)  discontinued  dissemination  of  new  textbooks  and  learning  materials, \nteaching methodologies, and learning assessment systems after the Project ends. To mitigate \nthe risk, ADB will work closely with the Government to ensure adequate resource allocation for \nthe  education  sector,  counterpart  funds,  and  incremental  recurrent  costs  for  O&M,  and \nappropriate assurances are included. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n84.  In addition to standard assurances, the Government and MOE have given the following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Within 6 months of grant effectiveness, the MOE will adopt a project monitoring \nand evaluation plan acceptable to ADB. The key Project monitoring indicators \nagreed  by  the  Government  and  ADB  will  be  used  to  evaluate  project \nachievements and impact. \n(ii)  The Government will allocate in a timely manner adequate funding for (a) its \nshare of local costs of training programs for teachers and school directors and of \nlearning  materials,  (b)  government  counterpart  staff  salaries,  (c)  incremental \nrecurrent costs for the O&M of NTTI and all schools and TTIs rehabilitated or \nsupported under the Project, and (d) replacement capital costs for computer ", "19 \nequipment to be procured 4\u20135 years after initial procurement of such equipment. \nLocal  administrations  will  give  written  commitments  to  provide  budgetary \nresources for the O&M of schools and TTIs supported under the Project prior to \nthe tendering of civil works or provision and installation of equipment. \n(iii)  The Government will endeavor to maintain annual expenditure for education \nsector activities during project implementation equal to at least 4.5% of GDP, in \nline with its medium-term budget framework. In this connection, the Government \nwill annually provide ADB with information on allocations and actual expenditure \nfor the education sector. \n(iv)  Within 12 months of grant effectiveness, MOE will review the results of the policy \nstudy  on  introducing  a  12-year  general  education  system  and  make  a \nrecommendation to the Government. \n(v)  MOE  will  establish  national  curriculum  writing  groups  based  on  competitive \nselection and ensure the provision of adequate budgetary funds for the writing \ngroups by October 2005. \n(vi)  The Government will approve a new curriculum for primary school by year 2, \nbasic secondary school by year 3, and upper secondary by year 4 of project \nimplementation based on the review of the new curriculum prepared by the \nnational curriculum writing groups. Within 24 months of grant effectiveness, MOE \nwill  adopt  a  written  policy  on  teacher  training  standards,  and  professional \nrequirements  at  different  levels  will  be  adopted  in  synchronization  with  the \nadoption of the new curriculum. \n(vii)  The Government will continue its policy of strengthening teacher incentives to \nmake the teaching profession more attractive and ensure that adequate numbers \nof qualified teachers are attracted to teaching positions in rural and remote areas. \nThe Government will progressively increase teacher salaries by at least 15% \nannually during the project period. \n(viii)  Within 6 months of grant effectiveness, the Government will prepare a time-\nbound  action  plan,  detailed  criteria,  and  implementation  mechanisms  and \nprocedures for the RTIS acceptable to ADB. The RTIS shall provide for the \ntransfer of at least Som2,000 per month for each teacher selected to work in rural \nschools into a special deposit account for at least 3 years. In addition to support \nfor the RTIS from grant funds, the Government will provide RTIS funding for at \nleast 200 additional teachers annually from budget funds. \n(ix)  MOE  will  include  detailed  information  on  the  implementation  of  the  RTIS  in \nquarterly progress reports submitted to ADB, including the number of teachers \ncovered, their subject areas, and the schools to which they are assigned. RTIS \nimplementation will be reviewed periodically, and necessary amendments may \nbe agreed between ADB and the Government. A comprehensive review of the \nfunctioning of the RTIS will be undertaken in connection with the midterm review, \nand may serve as the basis for necessary adjustments. Prior to completion of the \n3-year  pilot  phase  of  the  RTIS,  the  Government  will  review  the  measures \nnecessary to ensure sustainability of its impact, including continuation of the \nscheme under budget financing until the schools are staffed with teachers. \n(x)  Within 12 months of grant effectiveness, and prior to provision and installation of \ncomputer and language laboratory equipment, the Government will ensure that \nall schools, NTTI, and TTIs to receive the computer equipment will have at least \none  qualified  computer/informatics teacher,  and  that  all schools  and  TTIs  to \nreceive language laboratory equipment have  at least one qualified language \nteacher. \n ", "20 \n(xi)  Within 12 months of grant effectiveness, and prior to provision and installation of \ncomputer  equipment  the  Government  will  ensure  that  security  arrangements \n(steel doors, burglar bars on windows) are in place in computer classrooms of \nthe project schools. \n(xii)  Within 6 months of grant effectiveness, MOE and the CPIU will prepare selection \ncriteria for external training on curriculum development and learning materials, \nand on learning assessment, and a list of candidates and submit the same to \nADB for approval. \n(xiii)  The Government will require that each participant in the external training program \nenters into a contract with the Government which commits the participant to work \nfor a government institution for at least 3 years after completing the external \ntraining, or reimburse the full cost of the external training provided under the \nproject, if the participant fails to complete the contract. \n(xiv)  The Government will ensure that the Project will not entail any land acquisition or \nresettlement. \n \nVI.

Education and Science in the Kyrgyz Republic. Bishkek.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  25 \nANALYSIS OF THE EDUCATION SECTOR \n \nA.  Structure of the Education System \n \n \n1.  The education system in the Kyrgyz Republic follows the Soviet model of 11 years of \ngeneral education. Primary and lower secondary (basic) education are compulsory. Primary \neducation (grades 1\u20134) begins at age 6 or 7. Lower secondary education covers grades 5 to 9. \nUpper  secondary  education  includes  grades  10\u201311.  The  Constitution  stipulates  free  basic \neducation to all children.  \n \n2.  In 2002, 9.5% of children 1\u20136 years of age were enrolled in 416 preschools, down from \nabout one in four enrolled before independence. Urban enrollment was 24.7%, and rural 3.8%. \nIn 2002, 96.8% of the primary school age group was enrolled in primary schools (97.8% of boys, \n95.8% of girls). Lower secondary education enrollment was 92.8% (92.6% of boys, 93.0% of \ngirls). Enrollment in upper secondary education was 72.0% (68% of boys, 76.1% of girls).  \n \n3.  There were 2,045 daytime general education schools in school year (SY) 2004, of which \n351 were urban and 1,694 rural. Of the total, 137 schools were primary only, 164 were basic \n(grades 1\u20139), and 1,722 were complete secondary schools. The large majority of schools \n(1,323) taught in Kyrgyz. There were 148 Russian-only schools, 132 Uzbek-only schools, and \none Tajik-only school. Two or more languages of instruction were offered in 421 schools. There \nwere 380 state schools with a focus on certain subjects enrolling 147,767 students, 110 state \ngymnasiums with 60,300 students, and 54 state lyceums with 18,624 students. Eight schools \noffered evening classes for 1,238 working students in SY2004. Table A3.1 presents an overview \nof general education. \n \n4.  A total of 26 boarding schools enrolled 5,434 students in SY2004, of which 873 students \nwere without parental care and 496 disabled. Twenty of the boarding schools (12 in rural areas) \nenrolled 2,456 students with special needs. Of these special students, most were mentally \ndisabled, 205 were blind or had vision difficulties, 530 had hearing disabilities, 237 were haring \nfeeble, and 277 had grave speech disabilities. Another 250 children with mental disabilities \nattended inclusive classes in daytime boarding schools. The number of children in inclusive \nclasses rose from 377 in SY1999 to 674 in SY2002 but dropped to 250 the following year.  \n \n5.  In SY2004, most general education schools (1,525, or 75%) operated two shifts. In \naddition, 105 schools with 18,109 students operated three shifts. A normal school week for \nchildren in grade 1 consists of 20\u201322 \u201chours\u201d (45-minute lessons). The number of hours is 35 in \ngrade 9 and 32\u201333 in grades 10 and 11. A school week is 6 days, however the schedule may \nvary. \n \n6.  Vocational training is offered at two levels and administered by the Ministry of Labor and \nSocial Protection. There were 113 primary vocational education institutions (vocational technical \ncolleges or lyceums) in SY2003, of which 65 were rural. Total enrollment was 25,972 including \n9,258 female students; 22,007 were financed by the state budget and most (12,051) were \ngraduates  of  basic  education  (grade  9).  In  addition,  66  secondary  vocational  education \ninstitutions (technikum) operated in SY2003. Three were not state owned. Enrollment was \n25,989, among whom 16,861 were female. A total of 13,114 students were studying with state \nbudget  funding  in  23  specializations.  The  majority  studied  healthcare  (8,166),  followed  by \neconomics and management/business administration (5,276) and education (2,673).    \n \n7.  Higher education is offered in 46 institutions, the majority of which (30) are in Bishkek. \nAmong the 199,124 students in SY2003, 103,577 were in day programs, 1,251 in evening \nstudy, and 94,296 in distance-learning programs. Fifty-four percent of the students in higher \n ", "26  Appendix 3 \neducation were female, and 30,065 students received state funding. Nearly half of the students \n(96,874) studied humanities. Of these, 51% were in education (49,744 students). \n \nTable A3.1: Overview of General Education by Oblast (Province) \n(SY2004) \n \n  Kyrgyz  Batken  Jalal- Issyk- Naryn  Osh  Talas  Chui  Bishkek \nRepublic  Abad  Kul \nA.

Inefficiencies \nare to be removed, and public administration is to become more democratic and open. In \nresponse, the (then) Ministry of Education and Culture proposed in its Education Development \nConcept for the year 20101 a number of basic principles for a democratic education system. \nThey  included  democratization,  accessibility  to  high-quality  education,  decentralization, \ninternational quality standards, openness and mobility, and trust. A number of these principles \nhave  been  followed,  but  not  always  with  desired  consequences.  For  example,  more \nresponsibility has been decentralized to local government agencies, but most have such limited \nfinancial resources that schools struggle to finance utilities and maintenance and have no funds \nleft for other expenditures. National testing systems, rather than proving trustworthy have led to \ndistrusted by parents on the part of parents, and the implementation of autonomous testing \nsystem ACCELS. Other reforms, however, have proven positive. School committees have been \nformed and have become involved in decision making in schools. Despite financial constraints, \nsome  local  administrations  have  been  very  supportive  of  their  schools.

The Ministry of Education (MOE) is responsible for education policy and \nits implementation, education strategy development, state education standards, ensuring the \nright  to  education  and  equal  development  between  regions,  the  introduction  of  innovative \npractices,  the  training  and  upgrading  of  teachers,  statistical  support  and  monitoring,  and \ninternational  cooperation.  It  also  administers  national  institutions  (some  vocational  and \nspecialized  secondary  schools  and  colleges,  as  well  as  higher  education  institutions)  and \ndetermines, according to norms, expenditure for education on behalf of local government. MOE \ninstitutional capacity was strengthened under the ESDP, which supported (i) rationalizing MOE \nstaff and providing retraining to those laid off, (ii) strengthening the policy and planning unit at \nMOE, and (iii) establishing an education management information system for monitoring and \nevaluation. \n \n10.  Oblast (provincial) departments of education are responsible for secondary education, \nand  administer  vocational,  technical,  and  higher  education.  Raion  (district)  departments  of \neducation  are  responsible  for  preschool  and  primary  education  and  administer  secondary \neducation.

This management system is not yet fully decentralized,2 \nbut some authority exists for autonomous decision making. For example, local administrations \ncan raise and allocate funds for non-salary expenditures in schools. In other ways, however, the \neducation system is deconcentrated rather than devolved.   \n \n11.  Management improvement needs to continue both nationally and locally. National policy \nand strategy making and operational planning need improvement. Two new autonomous units \nwill be attached to the Kyrgyz Academy of Education: the Center for Strategic Planning and the \nCenter for Monitoring and Assessment. The World Bank\u2019s Rural Education Project (see footnote \n8 of the main text) will provide support for, and build the capacity of, staff in these new units. \nMuch also needs to be done to strengthen management capacity locally, regarding both school \ndirectors and school committees.   \n \n2.  Medium-Term Budget Framework \n \n12.              Human  resource  development  is  a  priority  in  the  comprehensive  development \nframework of the Kyrgyz Republic to 2010. As such, the Government is making efforts, despite \nits  limited  financial  resources,  to  support  the  education  system  in  accordance  with  the \nrequirements of a market economy. In its recently published Medium-Term Budget Framework \n(MTBF) 2005\u20132007,3 the education sector is one of four priority sectors, with health, social \nprotection, and agriculture. \n \n13.  The priority activities outlined in the MTBF are as follows: \n(i)  \u201cEnsure  targeted  support  for  children  from  socially  vulnerable  strata,  orphan \nchildren, including supply of clothes, shoes, [and] school books. Release 10% of \nchildren from requirement to pay for textbooks. \n(ii)  Based  on  availability  of  resources,  carry  out  capital  repairs  of  secondary \neducational establishments and equip and renew schools\u2019 furniture. \n                                                 \n2  Decentralization refers to a continual process of delegation from deconcentration to devolution (fully autonomous \ndecision making). \n3  Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2004.

After no growth in 2002, the gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 6.7% in 2003. The \nGDP growth rate is expected to drop to 4% in 2004 and then rise slightly, leveling at 5.2% in \n2007 (Table A3.2). Education expenditures in 1997 were 5% of GDP. They dropped to 3.4% in \n2001 but are projected to return to 5.3% in 2007. In 2005, education is to represent 4.6% of \nGDP (Som4.6 billion).

", "  Appendix 3  29 \n   \n3.  Education Expenditure \n \n15.  In  2002,  4.5%  of  the  consolidated  republican  (central  and  regional)  budget,  or \nSom3,350,400, was allocated to education. This was an increase from 2000 (3.5%) but a \ndecrease from 1998 (4.9%).4 Between 75% and 80% of the budget of MOE pays teachers\u2019 \nsalaries. Allocation of the remaining amount is at the discretion of the MOE, most often for \nrecurrent expenditures. General education (grades 1\u201311) receives the majority of education \nexpenditures (nearly 70% in 2001) and will continue to do so. More emphasis, however, will be \nplaced upon preschool education and vocational and technical education in the next medium-\nterm plan.  \n \n16.  Most capital expenditures are financed by donors (who provided Som45 million in 2003). \nOther education expenditures are financed by the regional administrations in oblasts and raions. \nApproximately 35% of the resources raised locally through taxes are sent to the center for \nreallocation. Naryn, Talas, and Batken oblasts are in deficit, with income at only about 30% of \nexpenditures. Another significant resource of school funding is parental contributions.  \n \n17.  School Recurrent Expenditure and Per Capita Cost. On average, 66% of the total \nexpenditure on vocational education comes from the state budget, and the balance of 34% \ncomes from parental contributions. In higher education, parental contributions averaged 59% of \nthe total expenditures during the past 4 years, and only 41% came from the state budget. A \ntenth of the students in higher education are on scholarship programs financed by the state, and \nthe rest have to pay tuition fees averaging Som16,000 per year per student. Data on financing \nrecurrent expenditures on education from 2001 to 2004 are presented in Table A3.3 below. \n \n18.  Although the state budget is the major source of financing for the education system, data \non parental contributions during the last 4 school years\u2014averaging 9% of total expenditures in \npreschool  and  6%  in  general  secondary  education\u2014shows  that  the  share  of  community \ncontributions  toward  financing  the  education  system  has  been  constant,  except  for  slight \ndecrease of 1 percentage point during SY2002 and SY2003 in preschool education and an \nincrease of the same size in the same school years for general secondary school (Table A3.3).  \n \n19.  Parental contributions to vocational education and higher education were maintained \nfrom 2001 to 2003 but declined in 2004 by 17% and 22%, respectively. It should be noted, \nhowever, that the annual budget allocated by the Government to finance the whole education \nsystem from 2001 to 2004 consistently met the annual recurrent expenditures financed from the \nstate budget.   \n                                                 \n4 National Statistics Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic.

Education  staff  in  countries  of  the  former  Soviet  Union  typically  have  had  minimal \nexposure to other approaches to education that are perhaps more innovative and effective. \nMany view their education system is quite satisfactory as it is. At the same time, they feel the \nneed to align their education systems more closely with those of other countries. To help \novercome this lack of exposure, short external training programs and longer overseas degree \nprograms  can  be  provided.  The  Project  will  provide  a  specially  designed  1-month  training \nprogram for 28 participants in two groups. Its objective is to provide participants with a thorough \nunderstanding  of  approaches  and  recent  innovations  in  curriculum  development,  learning \nassessment, and teacher training used in other countries. Participants will use this experience \nto develop the best means of modernizing their education system.   \n \n2.

It  will  initiate \ncapacity development in the Kyrgyz Academy of Education\u2019s National Teacher Training Institute \n(NTTI) and seven oblast teacher training institutes (TTIs) by reviewing their current approaches \nfor curriculum development, classroom assessment, and teacher training, and their need for \nexposure to alternatives. The consulting firm will then develop a 1-month training program to be \ndelivered at each institution for two groups of 14 specialists each. The first group will focus on \ncurriculum  development  and  learning  assessment,  and  the  second  on  teacher  training \nmethodology. These 28 specialists will form a core group to develop the new curriculum and ", " \n  Appendix 10  41 \nassessment and teacher training programs, and to act as trainers of trainers. The core group \nwill design training for curriculum and learning assessment developers; authors, editors, and \npublishers; and teacher trainers. The core group will develop the new curriculum and learning \nassessment systems and be involved in the design and delivery of the training programs for \nteachers  and  school  directors.  The  core  group  will  monitor  testing  and  the  impact  of  the \nintroduction of national curriculum, learning materials, and learning assessment, and make \nnecessary adjustments.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reducing poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic: \n \nAccess to education is a Government priority under the national poverty reduction program. The National Education \nDevelopment Concept to 2010 outlines quality of education as a priority. Education is the basis for development of all \nchildren and leads to better human capital development. Basic education brings benefits such as a better-educated \nworkforce, improved skills allowing people to earn higher income, and a reduction of poverty. The proposed project \nactivities are based on an integrated approach to address interlinked education issues related to poverty reduction. \nThe activities include developing a modern curriculum, a new generation of learning materials, modern student \nlearning assessment and improved teacher training, and upgraded school facilities. These innovations will contribute \nto improved quality of and access to education, particularly for poor and vulnerable children. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                  Poverty Classification: Targeted intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nGovernment statistics1 indicate that in 2001 more than 40% of urban and 47% of rural residents were poor. Today, \n10% of the population receives government allowances or welfare, and 97% of these people are children. Special \nstate care is given to handicapped children. These children receive monthly social allowances regardless of their \nfamilies\u2019 needs and income.  \n \nA priority of state social policy is to help the development of children by creating opportunities for social participation, \nnot simply by providing welfare. The first step in this direction was the social passport system started in 1999, which \nallows families to be categorized  by their social  and economic potential. State support led to socioeconomic \ndevelopment  through  start-up  capital  (microfinancing;  microcredit;  the  provision  of  land  and  equipment;  the \nteaching/learning of basic knowledge; and re-training unemployed people to learn professions in high demand).  \n \nIn 1999, the state budget allocated funds to an education foundation with the purpose of supporting pupils from poor \nfamilies. To provide timely and complete financing, five foster homes and 15 specialized boarding schools with a total \nof 3,000 pupils have been transferred to the republican budget since 1996. In addition, the state budget also supports \nfoster homes for children. During 1997\u20132000, Som3.3 million were allocated to foster homes. \n \nThe Project\u2019s intervention is classified as a targeted intervention\u2013household, because project activities focus on \nschools in rural areas, where 60% of students hold a social passport2  indicating that they come from poor families. \nThe Project contributes to the Government\u2019s efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, particularly \nregarding universal access to education and the eradication of poverty. The Project\u2019s focus on poor rural schools will \ncontribute to alleviating the poverty of more than 50,000 students and their families.  \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nThe Project was designed for stakeholder participation, including key policy makers in the central and regional \ngovernment,  line  ministries,  parliamentary  representatives,  oblast  (provincial)  and  raion  (district)  education \nadministration authorities, the donor community, private publishers, parents, teachers, students, village authorities, \nand children with disabilities. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  National Statistics Committee.

Activities include a public \nawareness campaign to support the successful implementation of the new curriculum and learning assessment \nsystems, as well as village community involvement in monitoring the rehabilitation of school facilities and support \nthrough in-kind contributions.

Four aspects are relevant to the economic and financial sustainability of the Project:  (i) \npoverty reduction; (ii) savings on school recurrent expenditures; (iii) the availability of adequate \nfunds to finance project expenditures, especially funds drawn from the Government budget; and \n(vi) financial incentives for teachers necessary to ensure participation in the Project. \n \nA.  Impact on Earnings and Poverty \n \n2.  Ensuring access to basic education is a key intervention for poverty reduction. In the \nKyrgyz Republic, 70% of the total population, or 3.5 million people, live in rural areas. The \npoverty prevalence survey conducted for the Kyrgyz Republic in 1999 showed that 70% of the \nrural population lived below the poverty line.1 The findings of the 2001 household budget survey \nreflected in the 2003 Kyrgyz Poverty Report2 also showed an inverse correlation between \nschooling and the prevalence of poverty (Table A14.1).     \n \nTable A14.1: Headcount Prevalence of Poverty by Education of Household Head \n(2001) \n____________________________________________________________________________ \n   Level of Education                               Absolute Poverty (%)             Extreme Poverty (%) \n   Higher/incomplete higher                         35.8                                      9.9 \n   Secondary vocational                               52.6                            21.8 \n   Secondary general                                     66.7          32.4 \n   Incomplete secondary                                56.3                                          27.2 \n   Primary                                                        68.1        36.3 \n   Below primary                   78.0        19.1 \n   All households                  56.4        24.7 \nSources: World Bank. 2001. Household Budget Survey (weighted estimates). Washington, DC. \n \n3.  The findings shown above confirm that personal income is associated with educational \nattainment. Regressed data from the 1998 Kyrgyz Poverty Monitoring Survey3 showed that \ncompletion of secondary schooling was associated with 12% higher earnings than those with \nlower level of education. Education, therefore, is an important instrument for poverty reduction. \nThe same study also found that the dropout rate before completing secondary education is \nhigher in rural areas than in urban areas, and higher among the poor than the non-poor. \n     \nB.  Savings on School Recurrent Expenditures \n \n4.  Finance data from the survey of the 90 priority schools conducted in 2004 during the \nproject feasibility study indicated that 25% of the schools\u2019 recurrent budgets was spent on \nutilities and 7.5% on O&M. On average, the cost of utilities and O&M is Som278,002 ($6,620) \nper school annually. This is quite high considering schools\u2019 limited budgetary resources. \n \n5.  The  Project  will  significantly  reduce  recurrent  expenditures  in  covered  schools  by \nimproving management efficiency and reducing utility and maintenance costs. By improving the \nefficiency of building heating systems through repairs to windows, roofs, floors, insulation, and \nwater supply systems, the operating cost per student will be decreased. Based on the 53% \ndecrease in school expenditures that resulted from the rehabilitation of schools under the \n                                                 \n1 World Bank. 2003 World Development Indicators.

Project Direct Beneficiaries \n \n6.  The Project aims to improve the overall quality of primary and secondary education. \nImproved basic education is expected to lead to increased enrollment and retention and a \nreduction in the dropout rate, particularly in rural areas.  \n \n7.  The principal beneficiaries of the Project are the approximately 50,000 students and \nchildren in the school-age group, and 1,500 teachers and school administrators, of the 90 \npriority schools located mostly in rural communities of the seven oblasts in the country whose \neducational  facilities  will  be  comprehensively  rehabilitated.  Old  heating  systems  in  these \nschools  will  be  replaced  to  make  heating  facilities  of  the  school  operate  more  efficiently, \nparticularly during the harsh winter climate conditions in the rural and mountainous communities \nof the country. In addition, these schools will be provided with necessary instructional and \ntraining  materials,  as  well  as  teaching  and  classroom  computers  and  language  laboratory \nequipment under the Project. To increase internal efficiency, 4,000 teachers and 2,000 school \ndirectors from almost all the 2,045 primary and secondary schools in the country will receive \ntraining to improve their overall quality of teaching, student assessment, and administration.  \n \n8.  Students in project-supported schools and programs will directly benefit from better \ntrained teacher, improved learning materials, and better school educational facilities. These will \nhelp them prepare for further education, which will enhance their potential for securing viable \nemployment and future income-earning potential as educated citizens. Other economic benefits \ninclude the improved viability of village agriculture, better access to income opportunities for \ndisadvantaged rural students, a more highly educated workforce in future generations, better \nquality of production from better-educated workers, and greater employability for educated \nKyrgyz citizens. \n ", "  Appendix 14  57 \n9.  The social benefits include more highly educated parents to guide and influence their \nchildren, expanded opportunities and access to services and income, and reduced risk of \npeople suffering hardship, particularly in rural areas. \n  \n10.  Targeted benefits include an overall increase in the quality of education offered in terms \nof teaching and learning standards, and an improved learning environment. \n \nD.  Availability of Adequate Funds \n \n11.  The Kyrgyz Republic macroeconomic situation stabilized significantly during 1999\u20132002. \nIn 2003, the gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 6.7% in real terms, driven largely by the \nexpansion of agriculture and industry. From 1999 to 2001, real GDP grew at an average rate of \n4.8%  per  year.  Growth  particularly  in  the  agriculture  sector  has  provided  the  necessary \nconditions for growth in the private consumption by 5.2% in 2001. The inflation rate of 39.9% in \n1999 significantly dropped to only 2.3% in 2002, the lowest rate since independence. The som has \nremained relatively stable against the US dollar, which is the predominant traded currency in the \ncountry. In the full year to December 2003, the som appreciated against the US dollar by 1.5%.  \n \n12.   Economic reforms initiated after the economic crisis in the late 1990s have significantly \ncontributed to improving the Government\u2019s annual revenue, which has increased by about 30% \nfrom Som12.55 billion in 2001 to Som16.28 billion in 2003. Tax revenues rose from Som9.2 \nbillion to Som11.9 billion, or an increase of 29%, during the same period. In view of the \ncountry\u2019s  continuing  economic  growth,  particularly  in  agriculture  and  industry,  and  of \nimprovements in tax administration, the Government expects to sustain increases in revenue \ncollections during the medium-term period from 2005\u20132007 (Table A14.3). \nTable A14.3: Consolidated Revenue Receipts \n(Som million) \nItem  2005                       2006                     2007 \nConsolidated Budgetary Receipts  20,062.5 21,999.9           19.9  23,771.1  19.5%\nDomestic Budgetary Revenues  18,337.4 20,375.9 18.4 22,737.1  18.7%\nTax Revenues  15,044.7 16,758.7 15.2 18,747.7  18.6%\nNon-Tax Revenues  3,189.8 3,504.2 3.2 3,864.5  3.2%\nGrants including PIP grants  1,723.1 1,624.0 1.5 1,034.0  0.8%\nExtra-Budgetary Funds (Social Fund)  4,529.0 4,971.0 4.1 5,479.0  4.5%\nPIP = public investment plan \nSource: Ministry of Finance. 2004. Medium-Term Budget Framework. \n \n13.  As part of the overall strategy to develop the country, the Government has identified the \neducation  sector  as  a  priority  area  for  public  investment  under  its  medium-term  budgetary \nframework (MTBF). It has already incorporated in the budget framework for 2004\u20132007 the funds \nrequired to finance public investment projects including the cost of recurrent expenditures in the \neducation sector, for which funding commitments have already been negotiated. Although the \nrecurrent cost implications of public investment projects in the 2003\u20132007 MTBF are still indicative, \nthe Government also strongly emphasized in the plan financing the recurrent costs of public \ninvestment projects, which will be fully incorporated into the annual recurrent budget in future \nMTBFs. The Government budget will therefore be the main source of funds to meet the cost of \npublic investment projects and recurrent expenditures for the education sector. The Country\u2019s \ncontinuing economic growth and improving fiscal stability are indicative of the Government\u2019s \ncapacity to finance public investment projects such as this Project. \n \n \n ", "58  Appendix 14 \nE.   Fiscal Adequacy \n \n14.  A financial plan has been prepared showing details of expenditure and funding sources \nnecessary to ensure availability of resources to finance expenditures. The plan covers the entire \nimplementation period to ensure that funds are available to cover both capital and recurrent \nexpenditures.  The  full  fiscal  impact  of  the  Project  for  each  year  of  its  implementation  is \nsummarized in Table A14.4.  \n \n15.  Table A14.4 shows project development as well as recurrent costs over the period \n2005\u20132009 based on the assumption that the GDP will continue to grow at 5.20%, the share of \neducation expenditure in the GDP will remain at 5.3%, and the share of state budget going to \neducation will increase significantly to 22.09%. The development cost of the Project is estimated \nat 0.017% of education expenditure in 2005, increasing to 0.649% in 2008, and decreasing to \n0.471% in the last project year. Project recurrent costs are insignificant as they represent only \nabout 0.049\u20130.053% of expenditure on education.   \n \nTable A14.4: Macroeconomic Framework for Education Financing \n \nItem  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009 \nGDP ($ million)  1,226  1,367  1,525  1,601  1,909  2,086  2,285  2,512  2,766  2,740  2,954 \nState budget   305.31  240.59  250.10  307.28  371.05  526.33  585.34  621.09  661.67  696.49  770.23 \n($ million) \nEducation \nexpenditures. \n($ million)  63.67  48.07  58.83  71.44  81.35  91.40  110.96  132.22  154.44  151.47  170.17 \nEducation \nexpenditures \nas % of state \nbudget  20.80  19.80  22.71  23.25  22.02  17.37  18.96  21.29  23.34  21.75  22.09 \nGovernment \nshare \nof project \ndevelopment \ncost  \n($ million)a  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  0.019  0.241  0.498  0.983  0.802 \nProject \ndevelopment \ncost as % of \neducation \nexpenditure  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  0.017  0.182  0.322  0.649  0.471 \nGovernment \nShare  \nof project \nrecurrent cost \n($ million)a  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  0.055  0.091  0.090  0.089  0.090 \nProject \nrecurrent cost \nas % of \neducation \nexpenditure  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  0.049  0.069  0.058  0.059  0.053 \na Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n  Source: Ministry of Finance. 2004.
