I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) \nCorridor 6 (Marakand\u2013Karshi) Railway Electrification Project.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  The project is located in the remote and less developed districts of Samarkand and \nKashkadarya provinces. To support Uzbekistan\u2019s railway development, the project will finance \nthe electrification of the 140 kilometers (km) Marakand\u2013Karshi section of CAREC Corridor 6. \nThis railway upgrade will increase regional connectivity, cut transport costs, lessen greenhouse \ngas emissions, and boost trade.2 \n \n3.  With three CAREC corridors crossing its territory, Uzbekistan is a key transit country for \ntrade in Central Asia. The project is part of the government\u2019s railway development strategy;3 it is \naligned with Strategy 20204 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and is included in the \ncountry operations business plan, 2011\u20132013.5 It is also part of the CAREC Transport and \nTrade Facilitation Strategy and Action Plan6 and aligned with the Uzbekistan Transport Sector \nStrategy, 2006\u20132020.7 \n  \n4.  Uzbekistan\u2019s railway network has a track gauge of 1,520 millimeters and is 4,593 km \nlong (681 km of double line and the remainder being single line). Railways are crucial to the \neconomy, meeting specific transport demand such as for bulk haul of minerals and freight, \nintercity passenger services, and commuter services in urban areas. Annually, railways carry \nabout 75 million tons of freight and 15 million passengers. The entire rail system, managed by \nthe state joint-stock company Uzbekistan Temir Yullari (UTY), needs to be modernized and \ninstitutionally strengthened. ADB has supported the sector by investing in the rehabilitation and \nmodernization of infrastructure. The government began reforming the railway sector in 1997, \nand ADB supported this effort through technical assistance.8 Ancillary services were largely \nseparated from core rail operations. Public and private forwarding organizations with marketing \nresponsibilities have been established. Reforms are yielding results but institutional constraints \nneed to be reduced to realize the sector\u2019s potential. Overall, railways are profitable and have \nbeen able to finance their own infrastructure rehabilitation and modernization. \n \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2011. Technical \nAssistance to Uzbekistan for Preparing the Railway Electrification Investment Program. Manila. \n3  The government has formulated the Railway Electrification Program up to 2020 (Decree of the President of the \nRepublic of Uzbekistan No. PP-993, 5 November 2008) and prioritized under Decree of the President of the \nRepublic of Uzbekistan No. PP-1446, 21 December 2010, a three-part 5-year railway capital investment plan, \n2011\u20132015 with an estimated cost of $1.87 billion: (i) further development of railway infrastructure, (ii) railway \nelectrification, and (iii) modernization of rolling stock. \n4  ADB. 2008.

The north\u2013south corridor linking Europe through Central Asia to the Middle East and \nSouth Asia (CAREC Corridor 6) transits Uzbekistan from Keles on the border with Kazakhstan \nto Tashkent, Samarkand, Karshi, and Kumkurgan, before reaching Termez on the border with \nAfghanistan. The corridor annually carries about 10 million tons of freight, including 1.6 million \ntons  of  humanitarian  relief  goods  to  Afghanistan  (more  than  half  its  imports).  Afghanistan \nexpects more traffic from Uzbekistan and its northern neighbors via the corridor, especially after \nthe ADB-funded Hairatan to Mazar-e-Sharif railway in northern Afghanistan was completed in \n2010.9 The corridor will also enable the Uzbekistan provinces of Samarkand, Kashkadarya, and \nSurkhandarya to increase exports of cotton and its by-products, horticulture products, marble, \noil, and gas. Overall, rail traffic is increasing and inadequate rail line capacity in some sections \nof the route creates bottlenecks. \n \n6.  The northern part of this rail corridor from Keles to Marakand is electrified and operated \nby electric locomotives, increasing capacity and improving freight and passenger services. The \nremaining part of the rail corridor from Marakand to Termez is currently operated by less \npowerful  diesel  locomotives,  and  the  slow,  short  trains  limit  throughput  in  the  section. \nElectrification  will  help  overcome  capacity  constraints  and  meet  current  and  future  traffic \ndemand. From Karshi to Termez, electrification is in progress, cofinanced by UTY and the \nGovernment  of  Japan.  The  Government  of  Uzbekistan  has  requested  ADB  assistance  for \nelectrification on the remaining section from Marakand to Karshi.  \n \n7.  Besides providing transport to remote and less developed districts of Samarkand and \nKashkadarya provinces, the Marakand\u2013Karshi rail line links with three main railway routes: \nnortheast to Samarkand, Tashkent, and onward to Kazakhstan; northwest to Nukus, Urgench, \nand Kazakhstan; and south to Termez and onward to Afghanistan, with links to Tajikistan and \nTurkmenistan. Complete electrification of the whole route from Keles to Termez will bring the \nbenefits of uninterrupted electric traction for end-to-end movement of rail traffic. Upgrading the \nrail corridor will foster regional cooperation and promote regional development. \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s assistance in Uzbekistan\u2019s transport sector is satisfactory, and the government \nand development partners recognize transport as one of ADB\u2019s main areas of expertise.10 As \nthe lead development partner in Uzbekistan\u2019s rail transport subsector, ADB extended two loans \nfor railway development\u2014$70 million for the Railway Rehabilitation Project in 1998 and $70 \nmillion for the Railway Modernization Project in 2000. ADB\u2019s project completion reports and \nproject  performance  evaluation  report11 confirmed  both  projects\u2019  success  and  rated  the \nperformance of the government and the executing agency, UTY, highly satisfactory. The project \ndesign incorporates key lessons from ADB\u2019s experience in the transport sector in Uzbekistan, \nincluding  (i)  completing  tender  results  and  price  verifications  before  submitting  the  bid \nevaluation report to ADB for contract award, (ii) strengthening the executing agency\u2019s project \nimplementation capacity with consulting services for construction supervision, and (iii) obtaining \nthe government\u2019s and UTY\u2019s assurances for adequate funding for satisfactory maintenance of \nthe project line to assist the safe operation of freight and passenger train services. \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2009.

The \noutcome will be improved railway operation on the Marakand\u2013Karshi rail line. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n10.  The outputs will comprise (i) a 140 km electrified rail line from Marakand to Karshi and \n(ii)  improved  management  capacity  of  UTY.  The  project  envisages  design  speeds  of \n160 km/hour for passenger services and 100 km/hour for freight services on the project route. \nThe project components are described below: \n(i)  Railway electrification. The project will include (a) constructing an overhead \ncatenary system (OCS) consisting of two wires (for carrying alternating current \n27.5-kilovolt power for electric traction), supported by sloping hangers fixed to \nconcrete posts along the railway line; (b) constructing three traction substations \nin the project section at intervals of about 50 km; (c) providing local and remote \ncontrols for monitoring and supervision of power supply using the supervisory \ncontrol  and  data  acquisition  system;  and  (d)  upgrading  associated  track \nfacilities. 12  The  project  will  also  upgrade  signaling  with  computer-based \ninterlocking and communications systems to facilitate efficient operations. These \nsystems  are  compatible  with  electrification  and  are  protected  against \nelectromagnetic  interference  caused  by  high-voltage  electric  traction.  The \nupgraded  communications  system  will  link  traction  substations  with  nearby \nrailway stations. \n(ii)  Maintenance  facilities.  The  project  will  develop  maintenance  facilities  for \nelectric locomotives by refitting the Karshi depot currently used to maintain diesel \nlocomotives. The facilities in the existing depot and a subdepot about 3 km away \nwill be consolidated to improve efficiency by reducing downtime for maintenance \nand improving asset use. The project will also procure specialized equipment, \nincluding  motor  vehicles;  breakdown  vehicles;  motor  vehicle-mounted  drilling \nmachines; and protection facilities and a small powered plant for inspection, \nmaintenance, and attending to major breakdowns of OCS. \n(iii)  Institutional capacity improvement. The project will improve the institutional \ncapacity of UTY through (a) workshops and gender-sensitive training sessions \nfor  UTY  management  and  key  technical  staff,  which  will  improve  corporate \ngovernance and managerial skills and optimize costs to improve corporate social \nresponsibility and profitability; (b) training of UTY staff, specifically in project \nmanagement  and  crosscutting  areas  relevant  to  railway  development;  and        \n(c) upgrading of the technology and skills of UTY staff through training in the use \nand  maintenance  of  state-of-the-art  equipment  for  the  project  procured  from \ninternational sources, including testing and commissioning of equipment under \nactual conditions of operation.  \n \n                                                 \n12  The project will upgrade the line and level of the rail tracks to the design standard before OCS installation. A total \nof 21 km of track curves will be realigned. Arrangements will be provided at some bridges for installing support for \nOCS and for carrying communication cables across the bridge spans. Tracks at stations will be lengthened to \n1,050 meters in accordance with the standard for electrified sections to ease the operation of longer and heavier \ntrains with electric traction. Additional siding tracks will be provided to service traction substations. Track works will \nmake use of some recycled materials. \n ", "4 \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n1.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  UTY will be the executing agency. It has established a project implementation unit (PIU) \nand  appointed  the  project  director  and  key  staff  to  deal  with  procurement;  engineering \n(signaling, telecommunications, and electrification and civil works); project accounts; and staff \ntraining. PIU staff members have experience in implementing and managing similar projects.13 \nTechnical departments of UTY will also assist the PIU. An international firm will be recruited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime) to (i) help the PIU supervise project implementation and manage contracts; (ii) provide \nhands-on  training  in  project  management  and  oversight,  operation  and  maintenance,  and \nreporting; and (iii) improve institutional capacity.  \n \n14.  All procurement financed under the ADB loan will follow international competitive bidding \nprocedures pursuant to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \nADB\u2019s prior review procedures will be followed. UTY will include the relevant sections of ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) in all bidding and contractual documents. Civil \nworks and supply of materials and equipment from ADB non-member countries will be financed \nby UTY from its own resources and procured under existing government procedures consistent \nwith the principles of economy and efficiency. \n \n15.  Project  implementation  will  take  about  4.5  years.  Advance  procurement  actions  to \nexpedite  project  implementation  will  be  considered  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement  and \nconsulting  services  guidelines.  The  loan  closing  is  expected  by  30  September  2016.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n16.  The technical viability of the equipment, facilities, and technology selected, and the \nmodality of implementation were assessed, considering the available capacity and areas that \nneed to be improved. The design features and construction standards for electrification were \nreviewed for sustainability of the technology, and local capacity for successful operation and \nmaintenance of the electrified railway line. \n \n17.  Electrification  of  the  single  line  from  Marakand  to  Karshi  will  help  reduce  capacity \nconstraints in the section. The modality of implementation of various components is guided by \nprinciples of efficiency, economy, and the need for technology improvements in UTY and staff \ntraining. The project includes international competitive bidding (ICB) procurement of design, \nsupply, and installation of plant for traction substations, power control equipment (supervisory \ncontrol  and  data  acquisition),  and  signaling  and  telecommunications  systems.  Antiquated \nsignaling  and  telecommunications  equipment  (1970s  vintage)  needs  to  be  upgraded.  The \ncurrent equipment does not protect against the effects of electromagnetic interference caused \nby  the  installation  of  27.5-kilovolt  railway  electrification.  State-of-the-art  signaling  and \ntelecommunications equipment and the associated staff training under the project will help UTY \nto update existing technology and spread the benefits to the entire system. Using equipment \nprocured through ICB, UTY will implement OCS, including sectioning posts, and refitting of the \ndiesel locomotive depot at Karshi to maintain electric locomotives. \n \n18.  OCS will be implemented and the Karshi depot refitted under normal traffic operations, \nwithout disrupting and/or stopping train services. Works requiring blocking of the line will be \ncarried  out  during  window  times  between  trains.  During  construction,  vital  rail  operation \ninstallation must be kept secure, especially because the project area is close to a region of \nongoing conflict. The arrangements for constructing these facilities consider the related issues \nof security (of existing installations) and safety of train operations and workers. UTY has the \nexperience  to  implement  railway  projects  in  the  region;  it  completed  the  railway  line  from \nHairatan to Mazar-e-Sharif in Afghanistan in 2010. \n \n19.  UTY  has  the  capacity  and  experience  to  build  electrified  railways;  it  completed \nelectrification of the 114 km Tashkent\u2013Angren section in 2010. Considering the special needs of \nthe project for phasing and interfacing works under various components so that it can be \nimplemented without adverse effect on train operations on the heavily trafficked route, a team of \ninternational consultants will assist UTY for supervision of construction. \n \n20.  UTY is experienced in operations on electrified railways. It maintains and successfully \noperates a total of 674 km of electrified rail sections, which comprise about 15% of the network \nbut carry over 40% of total traffic. To maintain electrified infrastructure, UTY has a well laid-out \nsystem comprising maintenance companies, each responsible for about 50 km of electrified \nsection. The maintenance companies operate from on-duty centers midway in each section, and \nare equipped with rail vehicles with insulated towers for scheduled inspection and maintenance, \nand  breakdown  vehicles  for  transporting  equipment  and  attending  to  medium  and  major \nbreakdowns and heavy maintenance work. Similar arrangements are envisaged for the railway \nline electrified under the project. To meet demand for rail traffic, electric locomotives and trained \noperation and maintenance staff are available. Institutional improvement will develop UTY\u2019s \nmanagement and implementation capacity and contribute to technological improvements. \n  \n \n ", "7 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n21.  The economic analysis compared the \u201cwith-project\u201d scenario (electrification for electric \ntraction) and the \u201cwithout-project\u201d scenario (status quo with diesel traction) for 25 years (5 years \nof construction and 20 years of operation). The project economic benefits include (i) energy cost \nsaving,  (ii)  travel  time  saving  for  freight  traffic,  (iii)  pollution  reduction,  (iv)  diverted  traffic, \n(v) avoidance of diesel locomotives purchase, and (vi) maintenance cost saving. The project is \neconomically viable, with an economic internal rate of return at 14.7%. The sensitivity analysis \nwas conducted to assess the robustness of the results of the economic analysis. The results \nshow the project would maintain its economic viability under various unfavorable scenarios.   \n \n22.  The  financial  analysis  compared  the  with-project  scenario  (electrification  for  electric \ntraction) and the without-project scenario (status quo with diesel traction) for 25 years (2017\u2013\n2042) with 10% residual value of capital assets. The project is financially viable, with a financial \ninternal rate of return at 13.2% versus the weighted average cost of capital of 2.6%. A sensitivity \nanalysis tested the effects of possible unfavorable scenarios with respect to changes in the key \nparameters that affect costs and revenues. For all unfavorable scenarios, the financial internal \nrate of return was found robustly intact. \n \n23.  UTY  has  a  financial  reporting  system  adequate  to  record  and  compile  transaction \ninformation into the financial statement with an appropriate internal control system. Its rail \nrevenue steadily grew over 2007\u20132010 at a rate of 20%\u201340% per year along with rail assets \nthat increased rapidly by 30% per year. Profitability remained high, at about 20% of operating \nincome ratio. The return on total assets was maintained at 10% and the return on equity at 15%. \nUTY\u2019s profitability, capital adequacy, and liquidity have all been excellent, proving its long-term \nfinancial sustainability. For 2011\u20132015, growth is expected to slow down, with a 3%\u20136% annual \nincrease in rail revenue. Nonetheless, profitability will remain intact, with an operating income \nratio of 23% and net profit ratio of 20%. UTY\u2019s financial performance will remain outstanding \nand its financial position strong. As maintaining profitability will be key to ensuring future capital \nadequacy and liquidity, the loan agreement will include a financial covenant for UTY to maintain \nthe operating income ratio at no lower than 20% over 2011\u20132015. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  Uzbekistan\u2019s performance in governance has progressed steadily, with reforms tackling \npublic financial management arrangements, particularly budget execution.15 An assessment of \nUTY\u2019s  procurement  capacity  and  financial  management,  among  other  governance-related \naspects, found that although UTY is a key player in identifying reforms and the development \nagenda for railways, it does not adequately provide the government upstream policy advice and \ncomprehensive development strategies. Other obstacles included a financial accounting system \nthat has yet to conform to international standards, and weak capacity to manage international \nprocurement, particularly of consulting services, because the law does not differentiate between \nprocurement of goods and consultancy services and because internal rules and procedures are \nlacking. The project will improve UTY\u2019s corporate governance on procurement and project \nmanagement through training and consulting services. \n  \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and UTY. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual (footnote 14). \n                                                 \n15 The Budget System Law and Treasury Law, approved on 17 December 2007, provides additional cover and better \npractices in managing public finances. The public expenditure reform process for 2007\u20132018 includes measures to \nincrease efficiency, accountability, and transparency. \n ", "8 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n26.  Railways are important to the people in the project area. They go by train to medical and \ncommercial centers in cities and other locations with more developed social infrastructure. The \nproject  crosses  two  provinces\u2014Samarkand  and  Kashkadarya\u2014with  a  total  population  of \n5.3 million, most of whom live in cities served by the main stations, such as Marakand, Ayritam, \nKashkadarya, and Karshi. The project beneficiaries are existing and potential passengers and \nfreight  customers.  Rural  women  frequently  use  train  services  to  sell  farm  products  and \nhandicrafts in cities. The Marakand\u2013Karshi train services are vital for all types of users, and as \nlong as trains are cheaper and more convenient (easily accessible, fast, comfortable, with stops \nalong the way, and with space for children and goods), they will compete with road transport. \nCheap, regular, safe, and fast access to education and health services in urban centers is \nanother benefit, especially for the poor.  \n \n27.  Measures  to  promote  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s  empowerment  will  include \nappointing a gender focal point in the executing agency for the implementation of gender-related \nactivities,  gathering  the  baseline  sex-disaggregated  data,  and  conducting  information \ncampaigns on HIV/AIDS, among others. The project is not a targeted intervention as it does not \nreduce poverty through standard direct actions at households, or involve specific services that \ntackle the geographical determinants of poverty. The project will improve railway operations, \nreduce transport costs, and increase access to basic needs for the people in the project areas. \nThe project will not have any negative gender impact. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n28.  The project is classified under environment category B. The due diligence confirmed that \nthe project does not pass through any environmentally sensitive areas and will not result in \nsignificantly negative environmental impacts. UTY prepared an initial environmental examination \n(IEE)  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  national  legislation  and \nregulations. The IEE was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 1 September 2011. The project will \nhave temporary and reversible environmental impacts that occur mostly during construction. \nProject-affected people were consulted. The IEE includes an environmental management plan \nto  minimize  potential  environmental  impacts  of  the  project.  UTY  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing the plan and submit to ADB an implementation monitoring report annually.  \n \n29.  The project will electrify the existing railway line within the right-of-way, and therefore \ndoes not involve land acquisition and resettlement (involuntary resettlement category C). In \ncase any land acquisition and resettlement impacts occur during implementation, UTY shall \nprepare a land acquisition and resettlement plan to be submitted to ADB for approval prior to \nawarding  a  civil  works  contract.  The  plan  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement and national legislation and regulations. The project is classified \nunder category C for indigenous peoples as it will not affect indigenous peoples as described in \nthe Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n \n30.  UTY has successfully implemented projects of similar size and nature. Major risks and \nmitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.16 The integrated project benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh the project costs. \n                                                 \n16 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n ", "9 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nWeak  An international consultant under the project preparatory technical assistance will \nprocurement  assist UTY in selecting consultants. \ncapacity and \nProject  implementation  support,  provided  through  engineering  and  construction \nprocurement \nsupervision consultants, will improve UTY staff skills and ensure timely procurement \ndelays \nand  implementation  and  transparency.  Capacity  improvement  will  be  monitored \nthrough progress reports. \nThe  government  will  ensure  that  the  examination  of  tender  results  and  price \nverifications  by  various  agencies  are  completed  before  submission  of  the  bid \nevaluation report to ADB for contract award.  \nLimited  The Ministry of Finance synchronizes financial assistance from various development \ncoordination of  partners and manages development coordination centrally.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n31.  The government and UTY have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. The government and UTY have \nagreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement \nand project agreement. \n32.  Loan proceeds will not be disbursed for works and goods until the subsidiary loan \nagreement between the government and UTY (in form and substance satisfactory to ADB) has \nbecome effective in accordance with its terms. \nV.
