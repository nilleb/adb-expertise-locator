INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  2011  country  programming  mission  for  technical  assistance  (TA),  the \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to deepen the capacity of county rural financial institutions to use and report on statistics \nfor rural credit. A TA consultation mission from 13\u201315 February 2012 in Hainan Province, the \nPRC  and  subsequent  consultations  reviewed  the  field  circumstances,  and  discussed  and \nagreed  on the  objectives,  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  costs,  consultant terms of \nreference, and counterpart contributions for the proposed TA project.  \n \n2.  The TA will enable small rural finance institutions to establish methods for effective \ncomputerization of new rural credit data requirements. It will include activities to ensure better \ncomprehension  of  the  data  required,  and  their  use  by  managers,  statisticians,  and  local \nregulators  to  better  manage  risk  and  improve  financial  products.  The  TA  involves  an \nassessment  of  the  current  small  rural  financial  institution  account  and  loan  data  systems, \nmethods of incorporating data extraction and submission in timely and cost-effective ways to \nprovide reporting to regulators and to managers, options for programming, training in data \ncollection, submission and use by managers of financial institutions, and dissemination of the \nresults. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Evidence suggests that rural credit markets are imperfect, and efforts to improve market \ndata can enhance competitiveness.2 Research in countries such as Brazil, India, and the United \nStates demonstrates the importance and value of data on rural finance\u2014in particular from a \nwider variety of types of financial institutions. Access to timely and reasonable quality data can \nimprove institutional delivery of credit, provide a better understanding of market development to \nplayers and regulators, and improve public policy. Given the nature of risks in agriculture and \nrural livelihoods, data on the credit activities of smaller financial institutions can help policy \nmakers stimulate growth in rural areas.  \n \n4.  Rebalancing of economic welfare in the PRC is a central interest of the government, and \nrural household incomes and services have been the government\u2019s key concern. In the financial \nsector deepening of rural financial system reform is under way, along with strengthening of \nfinancial  services  in  county  locations.  To  enable  tracking  of  financial  services  to  rural \nhouseholds, timely and high-quality rural financial statistics are essential. Existing data systems \nare a bottleneck, slowing the advance of rural financial reform and innovation. Although the \nMinistry of Finance and the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC), along with the China Banking \nRegulatory Commission, have promulgated policies to increase rural credit investment and \nrelated market development, the quality and timeliness of statistical reporting of rural financial \ninstitutions remains an urgent problem for the government.   \n \n5.  Rural financial institutions in the PRC, especially small and medium-sized institutions, \nlack advanced and mature financial statistical monitoring and management systems as well as \nreferential experience. Although the head office and provincial branches of the PBC have done \nsubstantial work to reinforce the statistics capacity of rural financial institutions, challenges exist \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 June 2012. \n2   For  example,  M.  Kilkenny  and  R.  Jolly.  2005.  Are  Rural  Credit  Markets  Competitive?  Is  There  Room  for \nCompetition in Rural Credit Markets? Choices. 20 (1). pp. 25\u201329; and A. Kumar, K.M. Singh, and S. Sinha. 2010. \nInstitutional Credit to Agriculture Sector in India: Status, Performance and Determinants. Agricultural Economics \nResearch Review. 23 (2). pp. 253\u2013264. \n ", "2   \nregarding technique and practice references, particularly in computerization of data. The PBC \nwishes  to  advance  rural  financial  statistics  competence\u2014improving  training,  information \nexchange, and statistics capacity establishment in financial institutions at the county level. \nComputerization and standardization of data and better understanding of what the data mean is \nan important aspect of this process. \n \n6.  Component 2 of ADB\u2019s TA for Rural Finance Innovation and Rural and Agriculture \nFinancial  Statistical  System  Development 3   supported  the  PBC  to  investigate  forms  of \nagricultural finance statistics in other countries, explore current methods of statistical collection \nand  analysis,  identify  issues,  and  establish  a  new  reporting  structure.  The  main  problem \nidentified was weak rural credit data collection and submission systems, most of which is done \nmanually using a variety of sources. The executing agency, the PBC Statistics Department, \nrecognized that the capacity of rural financial institutions to identify trends and uses of rural \ncredit data was limited. This led statisticians and managers in rural financial institutions to place \nless effort on the correct input and submission of data to the regulator, and indicated poor \nunderstanding of how the data can improve financial institution operations. \n  \n7.  The  following  improvements  are  critical:  to  (i)  build  integrated  development  and \nevaluation systems for financial statistical abilities, to address significant regional differences in \nthe capacity and responsiveness of rural financial institutions; (ii) establish an integral scheme \nor target-oriented method for improvement and computerization; (iii) enhance the reconstruction \nof  the  financial  statistical  monitoring  and  management  system  together  with  other  related \nsystems in rural financial institutions; (iv) strengthen statistical system training among statistical \nstaff  and  managers  in  rural  financial  institutions;  and  (v)  boost  information  exchange  and \nbusiness communication between counties and provinces.  \n \n8.  The first pillar of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2011\u20132015 is inclusive \ngrowth\u2014a core value in the government\u2019s 12th five-year plan.4  Improving access to finance and \nmanagement of natural resources are the two main areas of support. The proposed TA directly \nsupports  inclusive  growth  by  providing  better  information  on  the  financial  flows  to  rural \nhouseholds and businesses, thus enabling policy makers to understand and improve rules to \nincrease financial access, particularly in rural areas. \n \n9.  The proposed TA builds on ADB\u2019s TA for Rural Finance Innovation and Rural and \nAgriculture Financial Statistical System Development by establishing methods of integrating \ncomputerized data systems into existing accounts systems in small financial institutions in rural \nareas, and arranging for electronic submission and monitoring by local PBC offices.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The expected impact is improved quality, completeness, and timeliness of rural credit \nstatistics,  measured  by  computerized  rural  credit  statistics  system  submissions  to  the  PBC, \ntargeted at 70% by the end of 2017 (baseline zero). The expected outcome is the computerization \nof rural credit statistics systems for small financial institutions in selected counties, with a target of \n40%  of  county  statistics  computerized  by  the  end  of  2015  (baseline  zero).  By  the  end  of \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n ", "  3 \nimplementation of the TA, a clear template will be provided to all rural financial institutions with \ninstructions  on  how  they  may  incorporate  it  into  their  existing  accounting  and  loan  data \nmanagement systems on a computerized basis. In addition, rural financial institution managers \nand statisticians, and PBC county office staff, will have been trained, and their knowledge tested. \nIn this way, stakeholders can understand how to use the rural financial statistics submissions for \nbetter  business  development  and  risk  management,  and  can  support  expansion  of  the \ncomputerized statistics systems and data submissions. The PBC will continue to evaluate the \nlevels of computerized data submissions to monitor outcome progress. \n   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will deliver four major outputs:   \n \n(i)  a methodology for computerized submissions of rural credit statistics to the PBC; \n(ii)  improved training and results for financial institution statisticians and managers; \n(iii)  an information technology (IT) framework for rural financial institutions\u2019 statistical \ndata management as a knowledge product; and \n(iv)  support to the Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics meeting in the \nPRC, where findings will be presented.5 \n \n12.  To complete the outputs, the following steps are envisaged. Counties will be selected in \npilot provinces on the basis of (i) the concentration of county-level rural financial institutions, (ii) the \ninterest of rural financial institutions in participation, and (iii) observed weaknesses in statistical \nreporting  of  rural  financial  institutions.  After  consultant  recruitment  and  finalization  of  county \nselections, an international study tour of data collection systems for rural financial institutions will be \nconducted in selected countries. The PBC will undertake start-up workshops and assessments in \nselected counties to determine the level of data currently collected, how it is stored and used, and \nmechanisms  that  can  be  used  for  computerization.  The  computer  firm,  with  inputs  from  the \nconsultants, will then design a template for data requirements aiming at statistical standardization \nand options for computerization methods; and estimate costs for institutions to convert electronic \ndata. The TA consultants and PBC will work with target rural financial institutions to help complete \ntheir plans for conversion to electronic data submissions to the PBC. The draft results will be \nreviewed by a peer group composed of statisticians and computer software specialists and will be \nrevised accordingly. The TA will then support interested rural financial institutions to computerize \nrural financial statistics reporting requirements and submit the rural credit statistics reports to the \nPBC by electronic means. After the initial work, the team will review and revise the process and \nrefine the results. Based on the above activities, the TA will develop an IT framework for rural \nfinancial institutions\u2019 statistical data management. The results will be published as a technical note. \n \n13.  To  achieve  the  training  results,  the  TA  will  initially  assess  and  conduct  a  pretest  to \ndetermine the level of knowledge of rural financial institution managers and statisticians on how \nthey  access  and  use  data  to  develop  markets  and  serve  clients;  and  include  reviews  of \ncomputerization. The work will include a review of the training methodology that enables the \nparticipants to learn most effectively. The TA team will design a training course using the results of \nthe electronic submission template and the knowledge of managers and statisticians. The team will \ndeliver the training course and perform a posttest, analyzing the differences between the pretest \n                                                \n5  The  Irving  Fisher  Committee  on  Central  Bank  Statistics  (IFC)  is a  forum  of  central  bank  economists and \nstatisticians, as well as others who want to participate in discussing statistical issues of interest to central banks. \nThe IFC is established and governed by the international central banking community and operates under the \nauspices of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). http://www.bis.org/ifc/index.htm. \n \n ", "4   \nand posttest and revising the training course. Based on the findings of the course and testing, the \nTA will assist the PBC in establishing a training course into PBC training colleges as a knowledge \nproduct, replicate the training; and provide relevant training materials (including videos and printed \nmaterials) and use internet-based training. \n \n14.  Targeted workshops will be organized for different stakeholders at various stages of TA \nimplementation.  These  will  include  but  not  be  limited  to  an  inception  workshop,  an  interim \nworkshop, and a draft final report workshop. All workshops are expected to be attended by an ADB \nmission, government officials, consultants, and specialists in relevant fields to ensure the inclusion \nof diverse views and wide dissemination of project outputs. The PBC will ensure that all finalized \nreports and recommendations are circulated across all relevant local government departments and \nrural finance institutions.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $400,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The  government  will  provide \ncounterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office,  office  supplies,  domestic \ntransportation, and other in-kind contributions. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. The PBC has agreed to make other direct contributions in the following areas: \nall international study tour costs in excess of the TA budget; and all workshop costs in excess of \nthe TA budget. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will begin on 1 July 2012 and end on 31 December 2014 for a total of 30 months. \nThe Statistics Department of the PBC will be the executing agency.  \n17.  The TA will cover remuneration, travel, and per diem of consultants, as well as training, \nworkshops,  and  miscellaneous  expenses.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  done  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time).  \n \n18.  There will be two individually recruited consultants; one international computer statistics \nspecialist for 2 person-months, and a national credit market data specialist for 2 person-months. \nAll consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 3, with deliverables linked to the design and monitoring framework. All consultants\u2019 \nreports will be prepared and provided in English and Chinese. The consultants will maintain \nclose working relations with the PBC and will regularly discuss project progress and findings.  \n \n19.  A  computer  software  development  firm  will  be  recruited  using  the  consultants \nqualification selection system. The firm will complete and demonstrate computerized systems of \nrural credit data reporting that meet PBC requirements and can be used by managers to \nimprove performance. The scope of work involves familiarization with existing systems (manual \nand computerized) for data flows in small rural financial institutions, definition of a methodology \nfor computerized data aggregation and reporting, assessment and recommendations for cost-\neffective  computerization  of  reporting,  and  oversight  of  installation  and  use  in  three  rural \nfinancial institutions. The firm will work very closely with the PBC to achieve the results. \n \n ", "  5 \n20.  The PBC will supervise the day-to-day work of the consultants and take responsibility for \nadministering national training programs, seminars, workshops, and international study visits. \nADB will assist the PBC in overall TA operations, monitoring, facilitating international study tours, \nand disseminating knowledge results. \n \n21.  The project-specific indicators and targets in the design and monitoring framework will \nbe  monitored  by  the  PBC  with  ADB  support.  Policy  dialogue  will  be  maintained  with  the \ngovernment and project-specific issues will be discussed with government counterparts during \nreview missions. Technical milestones will be monitored by reports to be prepared by the \nconsultants  and  reviewed  by  the  PBC  and  project  officer.  The  team  leader  will  monitor \nmilestones related to TA implementation. \n \n22.  The  knowledge  products  include  a  technical  note  with  the  methodology  and  an  IT \nframework for computerized submissions of rural credit statistics, a training program document, \nand a summary presentation of the results and implications. The knowledge products will be \ndisseminated by the PBC training institutes, through the ADB and PBC websites, and at the \nproposed international seminar.  \n \nIV.
