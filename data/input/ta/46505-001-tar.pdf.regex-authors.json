The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and the Republic of the Marshall Islands \n(RMI) will complete the current Compact of Free Association with the United States (US) in \n2023. Grants from the Compact constitute an important funding source for education, health and \ninfrastructure expenditures in the FSM and the RMI.  The countries are on the threshold of self-\nreliance, yet they need considerable technical support and capacity building to deliver quality \neducation. While the countries have made some gains in gender parity and primary school \nstudent  enrollment,  ongoing  challenges  include  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  their \neducation systems.  \n \n2.  Students in the FSM and the RMI have difficulty achieving basic language literacy \nstandards (in the local language or English) and basic mathematics, as well as completing high \nschool. Students who graduate often lack the job skills needed to succeed in the local and \nglobal workforce. Those who seek a place outside the formal economy often lack the life skills \nneeded to ensure a secure, high-quality existence. The FSM and the RMI must address these \nissues and prioritize education initiatives that boost quality and relevance, with good planning \nand adequate funding to ensure a continuing focus on education quality.  \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB), through technical assistance (TA) for the FSM, \nPalau, and the RMI (commenced in September 2013), will deliver classroom support for literacy \nand numeracy assessment, teacher training, and capacity building for education managers in \nassessment and instruction.1 To enhance the impact of such quality-focused initiatives, the \neducation management system should prioritize and sustain results-bearing initiatives. The FSM \nand the RMI should utilize evidence and data to make decisions on budget priorities, and \nensure that quality teaching and learning are key focus areas to improve quality of education \nservices for students. \n \n4.  The FSM and the RMI requested ADB to support national capacity building to help meet \nthe  demands  of  delivering  quality  education  services,  by  optimizing  the  use  of  declining \nbudgetary resources available for the sector. The two countries share similar sociopolitical \ncontexts  and  educational  challenges.  A  regional  approach  to  addressing  the  issues  can \nleverage impacts through cross-country initiatives. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. 2   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Current education challenges. The FSM and the RMI face some of the most daunting \nchallenges in education development in the Pacific. In the FSM, the main education challenges, \nas outlined in its Focused Strategic Plan (2009\u20132015), include very low student achievement in \nthe National Standardized Test results. 3 The 2011 test results for grade 6 reading indicated that \nonly 26% of students achieved the minimum competency or higher. Gender differences in terms \nof student performance are minimal: 29% of girls reached the minimum standard or higher, 28% \nof boys. For the 10th grade, reading scores showed 10% of males reached the minimum \nstandard  or  higher;  and  26%  of  females.  While  the  number  of  unqualified  teachers  is \ndecreasing; in 2012, approximately 20% of the country\u2019s 1,855 teaching staff still lacked the \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012.

Weak leadership capacity, limited community participation in the \neducation sector, and unreliable data also contribute to the general low quality and relevance of \neducation. 4 \n   \n6.  The RMI faces similar challenges, as identified in its sector Strategic Plan, 2013\u20132015. \nStudent achievement, as demonstrated by the Marshall Islands standard achievement test, is \nunacceptably low, with only 20% attaining proficient or higher for grade 3 English in 2011/12. \nThe school system has achieved gender parity in terms of access, although more progress is \nneeded to achieve the related goal of gender equality in terms of course topics.5 The Ministry of \nEducation  (MOE)  plans  to  produce  gender-differentiated  results  for  the  standardized \nachievement test. Dropout rates are high throughout the school year, particularly for secondary \neducation. A 2006 World Bank report identified a 32% student cohort survival across the basic \neducation years by grade 12.6 Nearly 33% of the country\u2019s 850 teachers still possess only a \nhigh school diploma and the rate at which these teachers are earning degrees is slow (footnote \n5). \n \n7.  Education  sector  strategic  planning.7 Results-focused and costed sector strategic \nplans can help the countries better assess progress toward identified priorities. The upcoming \nexpiration of the FSM\u2019s Focused Strategic Plan presents an opportunity to review progress \nunder the current plan and develop a new national strategic plan or education master plan. \nWorking with states to move their long-term fiscal frameworks into state sector strategic plans is \na starting point for incorporation into a master education plan beyond 2015. In the RMI, MOE \nhas finalized a results-based Strategic Plan, 2013\u20132015, which identifies areas that warrant \nsupport in terms of costing, implementation, and monitoring.  \n     \n8.  Education budget management. Most FSM and RMI budgets for education operations \nare highly dependent on US Compact and other US federal funds. Management of the budget \ntransfer decrease or decrement, as agreed in the US Compact, has resulted in cuts of about 6% \nevery 3 years in the FSM, and about 2% every year in the RMI. These budget reductions may \ncause further disruptions in the education services if not effectively managed. Budget analysis \nand planning depend on reliable data required for sound decision making. Improved planning of \nresources and realizing efficiencies within budgeting for education priorities are key to ensuring \nthat quality education services continue during the 10-year decrement period and beyond. \n \n9.  The FSM and the RMI are accustomed to working on budgets based on a given budget \nceiling and can utilize support to help build budgets from the bottom up based on priorities. \nSuch exercises would allow them to determine the real financial resources needed to fund the \neducation system. Both countries utilize performance-based budgeting (PBB) processes, which \nrequire strong understanding of outcomes, outputs, and indicators to allocate budgeting. Linking \nresults and expenditures with activities as well as defining benchmarks have been challenging \nfor users. Support in this area would allow users to better account for, budget, and analyze \nexpenditures and make strategic allocations for funding. Additional monitoring and evaluation \n                                                \n4  Government  of  the  Federated  States  of  Micronesia,  Department  of  Education.  2013.

Education data systems. The US Government Accountability Office report underlined \nthe  need  for  the  FSM  and  the  RMI  to  focus  on  the  reliability  of  data  for  their  education \nindicators, claiming that neither country can demonstrate progress toward education goals with \ntheir  current  data  system.8 During  2004\u20132006,  both  countries  began  tracking  education \nindicators,  establishing  data  collection  systems,  and  collecting  data  for  national  education \nindicators. Eight of nine subsets of education indicators reviewed in the FSM were found to be \ninsufficiently reliable, and three of the five subsets of education indicators in the RMI were found \nto be insufficiently reliable. ADB could make urgent and needed contributions for education data \nreliability, management, and utilization. Efforts are just beginning in the FSM and the RMI to \nreview data; evaluate the appropriateness of the nation\u2019s education data framework and the \nsoundness of processes used, whether manual or computerized; and evaluate the reliability of \ninputs and verifiability of various points of entry. \n \n11.  FSM data management. A unified education management information system (EMIS) \nsystem for the entire FSM is challenging, given the nature of the federation. Two states utilize \nthe Pacific education data management system (PEDMS) and two other states use different \nsystems.  The  FSM  also  has  a  separate  system  that  tracks  Joint  Economic  Management \nCommittee (JEMCO) indicators required by the US Compact. Ideally, the systems would be \nintegrated.9 Currently the PEDMS creator is the only person capable of making changes to the \nsystem. At a minimum, relevant national staff should be trained to maintain and amend the \nPEDMS if the FSM continues to utilize the system.  \n \n12.  RMI data management. The RMI requests a new comprehensive and integrated EMIS \nthat would track (i) critical information necessary to better manage and analyze trends, including \nunique student identification numbers linked to student achievement test scores, and allow \ntracking of student movement and persistence; and (ii) teacher management information such \nas teacher qualifications, certification, training needs, and retirement age, allowing analysis of \nteacher  quality  and  supply  issues.  Such  a  system  would  contain  all  the  integrated  and \nnecessary  information to  facilitate reporting  on  Joint  Economic  Management  and  Financial \nAccountability Committee (JEMFAC) indicators required by the US Compact. Capacity building \non data collection, quality, system utilization, and analysis of data will be necessary to capture \nthe benefits of a new EMIS.  \n \n13.  Monitoring  and  evaluation.  Basic  M&E  principles  will  improve  analytical  skills  to \nevaluate effectiveness of initiatives, programs, and projects in terms of outcomes and results; \nand  will  provide  a  general  framework  for  interpreting  the  relative  value  of  investments  in \neducation. Training would target a range of staff, including financial staff who must understand \nthese basic principles to implement PBB: research and evaluation staff, budget managers who \nare decision makers in budget formulation, and national training center staff who must evaluate \neffectiveness of its grants to projects providing skills development to dropout youth.  \n \n14.  Strengthened policy formulation. With better data systems and M&E in the FSM and \nthe RMI, Pacific developing member countries can better target research studies to deepen \n                                                \n8 United States Government Accountability Office. 2013.

The  impact  will  be  improved  quality  of  education  services.  The  outcome  will  be \nenhanced national capacity to plan and manage education services. \n   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The TA will achieve the following outputs, giving greater priority to outputs 2 and 3. \n \n17.  Output 1: Improved education sector strategic planning. In the FSM, national and \nstate progress with the Focused Strategic Plan, 2009\u20132015 of the National Department of \nEducation  will  be  assessed.  The  states\u2019  long-term  fiscal  frameworks  for  education  will  be \ndeveloped  into  state  sector strategic  plans for  integration  into  a  national  strategic  plan  or \neducation master plan that is ideally based on results, is costed, and includes benchmarks to \nmeasure progress with operations. In the RMI, costs will be developed for 2014\u20132015 of the \nresults-based sector strategic plan.  Progress on implementation of sector strategic plan will \nneed to be monitored. The RMI may require long-term decrement planning support, as per US \nCompact requirements. \n   \n18.  Output 2: Strengthened education budget management. In the FSM and the RMI, \ncapacity will be developed to build budgets based on priorities to support better understanding \nof  actual  resources  required  to  fund  the  system.  Support  to  streamline  PBB,  a  required \nbudgeting system under the US Compact, will be linked to the overall government budgeting \nprocess. A user-friendly, streamlined manual for PBB will be developed in both countries. \n       \n19.  Output  3:  Improved  education  data  management  systems  for  better  decision \nmaking. In the FSM and the RMI, studies have just begun on improvements to data quality and \nmanagement  systems.  Consultation  with  governments  to  follow  up  on  these  reviews  will \ndetermine the best options for implementing an improved data management system. In the FSM, \nimproving the EMIS will include (i) developing EMIS capacity within the national and state \ndepartments of education to make system changes and address technical issues with the \nPEDMS;  and  (ii)  integrating  the  PEDMS  with  current  JEMCO  indicators  on  the  EMIS  in \ncoordination with secondary reviews. In the RMI, an entirely new, comprehensive, integrated \nEMIS will consider outer island connectivity and data issues. Both countries require capacity \nbuilding on data collection, utilization, and analysis; and the data management systems should \nbe able to generate more automated reports as a regular function. In RMI, the capacity of EMIS \nstaff within the MOE to make system changes and address technical issues will be developed. \n \n20.  Output 4: Monitoring and evaluation for better decision making. Training in M&E \nprinciples will be provided in the FSM and the RMI to provide a framework for evaluating \neffectiveness of initiatives, projects, and programs. A group of education staff will be trained on \nM&E principles to utilize performance-based budgeting, and to help policy and other managerial \nstaff to make evidence-based decisions on resources and priorities. \n     \n ", "  5 \n21.  Output 5: Improved policy formulation. In both countries, support will be provided to \nresearch and evaluation staff as well as policy staff to identify critical trends and issues based \non data, to convene policy dialogue on the issues, develop a policy brief, and to consider policy \neffectiveness. Constraints to policy implementation may be considered as improvements to \npolicy formulation.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n22.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, of which $700,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The governments will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, office supplies, \nsecretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan is \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  In the FSM, the National Department of Education will be the executing agency; the \nstate departments of education will be the implementing agencies. In the RMI, MOE will be the \nexecuting and implementing agencies. Each executing agency will identify a responsible officer \nto  coordinate  TA  activities.  Training  activities  and  national  and  regional  meetings  and \nworkshops will be implemented and administered by consultants. The TA will be implemented \nfrom 1 February 2014 to 31 January 2018.  \n     \n24.  The TA proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will require a total of  \n44  person-months  of  consultant  services  (20  person-months  international  and  24  person-\nmonths national). ADB will engage one or more consulting firm(s) following the fixed budget \nselection and simplified technical proposals in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  consultant  inputs  will  be  on  an \nintermittent  basis,  responding  to  government  requirements  and  progress  made  during \nimplementation.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to \nthe governments of the Federated State of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands \nfor National Education Planning and Management and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \n  and Indicators with  Reporting \nDesign Summary   Baselinesa  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact  By 2020:  EMIS data  Assumption \nImproved quality of  Improved student  MOE reports  Government support for the \neducation services  learning outcomes as  education sector remains a \nReports of national and \nin the FSM and the  measured by increased  national and state priority  \nstate departments of \nRMI  national test scores   \neducation \n  (baseline data to be \n  collected in 2014)  School reports \n \nOutcome  By Q4 2017:  EMIS data  Assumption \nEnhanced national  Annual education budget  MOE reports  The FSM and the RMI \ncapacity to plan and  allocation is consistent  governments continue to \nReports of national and \nmanage education  with priorities of the  value improved education \nstate departments of \nservices   national strategic plan for  planning and management \neducation \n  the given year  including improved use of \n  School reports  good data  \nTA progress reports   \n \nOutputs  By Q2 2014:  EMIS data  Assumptions \n1.
