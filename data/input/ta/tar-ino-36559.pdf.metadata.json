During  the  2003  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  Indonesia \nreconfirmed its request to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for advisory technical assistance \n(TA) to prepare the Subregional Transport Cooperation Initiative. In April 2003, a Fact-Finding \nMission visited Indonesia and discussed with the Government the objectives, scope, terms of \nreference  for  consulting  services,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan,  and  implementation \narrangements  of  the  TA.1  Appendix  1  gives  the  preliminary  TA  framework.  Subregional \ncooperation will help to reduce poverty in the poverty-prone areas of Indonesia. Outputs from \nthe TA will support the preparation of the Regional Cooperation Strategy for Southeast Asia. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  General. The recovery of Indonesia and other countries of the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) from the 1997 economic crisis opens the door to accelerating economic \nactivity in the affected regions. Subregional transport cooperation can play an important role in \nencouraging  cross-border  traffic;  it  can  create  growth  prospects  and  reduce  poverty.  The \nGovernment underscores the importance of developing a transport strategy for Indonesia to \ndevelop transport linkages with the Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines East ASEAN \nGrowth Area  (BIMP-EAGA), and the Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT).  \nIn Indonesia, BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT areas include 12 and 7 provinces, respectively. These \nprovinces, located in Kalimantan, Maluku, Papua, Sulawesi, Sumatra islands, could benefit from \nexpanded  economic  activities  within  BIMP-EAGA  and  IMT-GT.  The  recently  introduced \nadministrative  and  financial  decentralization  in  Indonesia,  which  brings  decision-making \nresponsibilities  to  the  regional  level,  needs  to  be  exploited  to  nurture  greater  subregional \ncooperation through development of proper transport linkages. \n \n3.   Government Policies and Plans. The Ministry of Communications (MOC) has prepared \nthe draft blueprint for long-term (2000-2024) transport development and within this broader plan, \na 5-year transport sector strategy and plan (RENSTRA and PROPENAS, respectively). The \nplans  clearly  indicate  the  Government\u2019s  policy  to  improve  transport  service  and  promote \neconomic prosperity in less developed areas. The draft blueprint emphasizes that subregional \ncooperation can be a means to stimulate demand in the region.    \n \n4.   Air Transport. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) to expand air transport linkages \nwas  signed  in  1995  by  participating  countries  in  BIMP-EAGA  and  IMT-GT.  The  MOU \nunderscores that air linkages will (i) provide access of goods and services for the population \nwithin the area, (ii) help encourage investments in the area and accelerate intraregional trade \nand promote peace and security. Cooperation involves harmonizing rules and procedures, \nexchanging  pertinent  information,  and  undertaking  programs  and  projects  for  further \ndevelopment. The Government has designated four airports as focal points for BIMP-EAGA \n(i.e., Balikpapan, Manado, Pontianak, and Tarakan),2 while three airports (i.e., Banda Aceh, \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 24 May 2003. \n2 PT Angkasa Pura I, a state-owned enterprise (SOE), manages the airports of Balikpapan, Manado, and Pontianak, \nwhile the Government manages Tarakan airport. ", "2 \nMedan, and Nias)3 were identified as strategic airports in IMT-GT. Despite a considerably low \nlevel of transport demand in eastern Indonesia, a subregional air transport network has been \ndeveloped. Air travel tax exemption between Indonesia and the Philippines has also been \nintroduced to accelerate travel between the two countries. \n \n5.   Sea  Transport.  The  Government  has  identified  14  ports  under  the  BIMP-EAGA \nprogram:    Ambon,  Balikpapan,  Banjarmasin,  Biak,  Bitung,  Jayapura,  Kendari,  Makasar, \nPantoloan, Pontianak, Samarinda, Sampit, Sorong, and Tarakan. Subregional maritime linkage \nhas been taking place with the development of a sea transport network of commercial links.4 \nIndonesia and the Philippines have also agreed to apply a uniform port tariff. \n \n6.    Road Transport. Indonesia and Malaysia are linked by road transport infrastructure. \nThere  are 11  border crossings  between  the  two  countries\u20148  land  crossings are  between \nSarawak and West Kalimantan, three are in East Kalimantan. Public transport service runs \nbetween Pontianak in West Kalimantan and Kuching in Sarawak, via Tebedu and Entikong.   \n \n7.    Subregional  Transport  Cooperation  Issues.  The  development  of  subregional \ntransport linkages has to address several strategic issues:  \n \n(i)  The revealed demand for transport between regions in Indonesia and the rest of \nthe sub-region is low,5 especially in the eastern part of Indonesia. However, the \npotential demand for transport may not always be explicitly evident. There can be \nsituations  where  new  trade  and  travel  opportunities  emerge  once  transport \nservices are provided. \n \n(ii)   The development of the Asian and ASEAN highways will facilitate land cross- \nborder traffic between Indonesia and Malaysia. Indonesia will not be able to \ncomply with the agreement reached by the ASEAN countries6 since road links \nbetween Sabah (Malaysia) and East Kalimantan are still missing. All designated \nroad cross-border points should also be operational.7  \n \n(iii)  The Government has yet to prepare a strategic plan in undertaking the projects8 \ndiscussed and agreed upon by BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT working groups.  \n \n(iv)  The unavailability of a plan and the implementation of subregional transport \nnetwork is due to lack of coordination between agencies of the Government. The \nCoordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs is the focal point for BIMP-EAGA, while \ntransport  sector  development  is  under  the  responsibility  of  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications and the Ministry of Settlements and Regional Infrastructure. \nCoordination between these agencies is currently weak. \n \n                                                 \n3 PT Angkasa Pura II, an SOE, manages Medan and Banda Aceh airports, while the Government manages Nias \nairport. In 2004, ADB will prepare a study of public-private partnership for developing Medan Airport, which is \nconsidered a strategic airport in the subregion. \n4 Bitung\u2013Davao\u2013General Santos, Zamboanga\u2013Makasar, Makasar\u2013Tawao, Davao\u2013Manado. \n5 Assuming adequate supply of air transport, infrequent flights may indicate the low demand level for air services. \n6 ASEAN transport ministers have agreed to construct all missing links by 2004. \n7 At present, out of five gates, only one gate with cross-border facilities in West Kalimantan (Entikong) is fully \noperational. \n8  For example, Trans Borneo-Mindanao Railway and Ferry Service between Medan-Penang. ", "    3 \n(v)  There is a need to review the strategic airports and ports on the Indonesian side \nto include those in new provinces that recently joined BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT.  \n   \n(vi)   The  role  of  regional  governments  will  become  increasingly  important  in  the \nfuture.9 Their involvement in subregional cooperation is therefore essential and \nhas to be considered. \n \n8.   ADB\u2019s  Subregional  Cooperation  Initiatives.  ADB  strongly  supports  regional \ncooperation initiatives in Indonesia10 as stated in the Country Strategy and Program (CSP) for \nIndonesia, 2003-2005. This is further reinforced in the Regional Country Strategy Update for \nSoutheast Asia region. The CSP for Indonesia also recommends that ADB conduct sector \nstudies  on  nonroad  subsectors  (ferry,  sea,  air)  focusing  on  upgrading  or  addressing  \ndeficiencies  in  each  system  in  line  with  a  defined  strategic  level  of  service  and  other \nrequirements specific to each region. ADB regional technical assistance (RETA) 562511 has \nidentified  policy  initiatives  and  programs  for  the  transport  sector  to  enhance  economic \ncooperation  in  BIMP-EAGA.  Meanwhile,  ADB  RETA  555012  has  proposed  some  transport \nprojects  to  accelerate  the  development  of  IMT-GT.  While  neither  of  the  two  RETAs  was \nspecifically  related  to  the  transport  sector,  ADB  RETA  6013,13  which  is  scheduled  to  be \ncompleted in 2003, examines possible programs and projects focusing on the transport sector in \nBIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT. Further, ADB RETA 605914 reviews the strategy of implementing \nsubregional cooperation in BIMP-EAGA. The World Bank has started the Eastern Indonesia \nRegion Transport Project focusing on the road sector, while ADB, through TA 4038-INO, has \nlaunched the Interisland Transport Project for eastern Indonesia. These projects will promote \nthe development of the Indonesian transport linkage to catalyze and reinforce parallel initiatives \nfrom other members of BIMP-EAGA. Another ADB TA 4144-INO: Private Sector Participation in \nPort  Infrastructure  under  Decentralization  will  help  identify  appropriate  policies  and \nimplementing measures for financing Indonesian ports including those in BIMP-EAGA and IMT-\nGT. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.   The  BIMP-EAGA  Development  Strategy  (footnote  12)  suggested  that  participating \ncountries focus on the development of productive sectors, such as agriculture, industry, and \ntourism. However, necessary conditions\u2014and the transport sector is considered one of them\u2014 \nhave yet to be created to promote the productive sectors. While ADB RETA 6013 (footnote 13) \nidentifies proposed transport policies and lists of projects for subregional cooperation between \ncountries of BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT, this TA will provide recommendations to the Government \nof Indonesia on necessary actions to follow up the findings of ADB RETA 6013, including \nimplementation and financial arrangements for specific projects.  \n                                                 \n9 Some regional governments have expressed their interest in managing small airports, including those located in \nBIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT, such as Sinabang (Aceh), Muara Teweh, Kotabaru and Tanjung Redep (Kalimantan), \nBanda (Maluku), Wamena, Karubaga, and Inanwantan (Papua), in response to the Minister of Communications \nDecree No 44/2002 on airport decentralization. \n10  This policy will also benefit neighboring countries. \n11 ADB. 1995.

The outcome will be a subregional transport sector strategy for Indonesia that aims to \neliminate trade and transport barriers, and accelerate economic growth. The strategy will (i) \nidentify  requirements, bottlenecks, and missing links in land, air, and sea transport systems; (ii) \nidentify TAs and investment projects that can be developed by the public and private sectors, or \nby public-private partnership to eliminate physical and other barriers to development; and (iii) \nprepare action plans to reduce nonphysical barriers to the movement of goods and people \nbetween Indonesia and neighboring countries. \n \n11.   The  TA  will  provide  (i)  blueprints  and  action  plans  for  subregional  transport  sector \ndevelopment in the study area to accelerate cooperation, reduce poverty, and promote peace \nand security; (ii) subregional transport policy initiatives, including institutional arrangements, \nfinancial and investment strategy, and legal supports, to implement the action plans; (iii) a road \nmap to undertake the proposed policies, programs, and projects; and (iv) terms of reference for \nfurther studies that are necessary for short-term actions. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.   Transport linkages in BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT will accelerate economic development. \nBalanced infrastructure development across borders will help reduce economic development \ngaps  between  adjacent  areas  and  thus  reduce  poverty  and  help  minimize  social  and \nemployment problems. ADB RETA 6013 (footnote 13) has described the existing and potential \ntrade  links  in  BIMP-EAGA  and  IMT-GT.  The  methodology  proposed  for  the  TA  strongly \nemphasizes sound program and policy formulation for the subregional development of transport \nlinkages in Indonesia to support these trade links. The objective will entail carefully assessing \nthe institutional and implementation constraints and consulting with relevant stakeholders in the \ntransport sector through workshops.  \n \n13.   Key activities will be formulating policy initiatives, pilot programs, and   investment \nprojects  to  encourage  subregional  cooperation;  maximizing  economic  impact;  and  helping \ncreate balanced development in BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT. Funding policies and mechanisms \nfor central/regional governments, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and the private sector to \nfinance  transport  sector  investment  under  decentralization  will  be  key  issues  in  program \nformulation.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n14.   The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $500,000 equivalent, of which $275,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $225,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $400,000 equivalent covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$125,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost, \nequivalent to $100,000 through the provision of office accommodation, Government counterpart \nstaff, and cost of compiling origin and destination (OD) data.15 Detailed cost estimates are in  \nAppendix 2.   \n \n                                                 \n15 OD data will be available before the consultants are fielded. ", "    5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.   The outline terms of reference16 for consulting services to carry out the TA are in \nAppendix 3. The TA will require 23 person-months of consulting services: 10.5 person\u2013months \ninternational  and  12.5  person-months  domestic.  The  international  consultants  should  have \nexpertise  in  (i)  transport  planning  and  policy,  (ii)  transport  economics,  and  (iii)  transport \nfinancing.  The  domestic  consultants  should  have  expertise  in  (i)  transport  economics,  (ii) \nregional/development economics, (iii) transport planning, and (iv) transport-related regulations \nand institutions. An international consulting firm in association with domestic consultants will be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2002 version) \nusing quality-and cost-based selection and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging \ndomestic consultants.  \n \n16.   The Secretariat General of MOC will be the executing agency (EA) for the TA. The EA \nwill provide a counterpart team led by the Planning Bureau of MOC to coordinate TA activities \nand work daily with the consultants.  \n \n17.   A  steering  committee  comprising  BAPPENAS,  Coordinating  Ministry  of  Economic \nAffairs,  MOC,  Ministry  of  State-Owned  Enterprises,  Directorate  General  of  Regional \nInfrastructure  (DGRI),  and  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  established  to  oversee  TA \nimplementation.  Local  stakeholders,  including  local  governments,  nongovernment \norganizations, the private sector, and civil society will take part in the consultation process. The \nEA will ensure that all documents, data, and information relevant to the TA are provided when \nneeded by the consultants. Office equipment for this TA will be procured by the consultants in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and will be transferred to the EA upon \ncompletion of the TA.  \n \n18.   The consultants will be fielded in July 2004, and will carry out their work over 6-months \nending in December 2004.17 They will submit their inception, interim, and draft reports before \nthe  end  of  months  1,  3,  and  5,  respectively,  of  the  TA.  Tripartite  meetings  involving  the \nGovernment, ADB, and the consultants will discuss the findings of the inception, interim and \ndraft reports. \n \n \nIV.   THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n \n19.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Indonesia for the Subregional Transport Cooperation Initiative, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n16 RETA 6013 findings (footnote14) will be reflected in the full TOR. \n17 The expected TA start and completion dates are 1 July 2004 and 31 January 2005, respectively.

Scope of Works \n1.  The consultants\u2019 tasks are described in the following paragraphs. \n \n2.  Collect Data.  Focusing on participating provinces in the Indonesian part of the Brunei, \nIndonesia,  Malaysia,  and  Philippines  East  ASEAN  Growth  Area    (BIMP-EAGA)  and  the \nIndonesia-Malaysia-Thailand  Growth  Triangle  (IMT-GT),  collect  updated  data  on  basic \nmacroeconomics  international  transport  links,  and  transport  infrastructure  defined  as  focal \npoints in the regions: (i) transport demand characteristics, (ii) transport network characteristics, \n(iii) transport infrastructure specification, (iv) transport operation and service characteristics, (v) \ntransport fares, and (vi) transport-related institutional and regulatory aspects of cross border \nprocedures.  \n \n3.  Assess Data.  Analyze the existing transport systems in Indonesian parts of BIMP-\nEAGA and IMT-GT, particularly international transport links. Assess the transport demand and \nidentify  transport-related  problems  including  transport  network  and  coverage,  infrastructure \ncapacity  constraints,  transport  service  and  operation  problems,  regulatory  and  institutional \nconstraints,  transport  infrastructure,  and  service  financing  constraints.  Using  origin  and \ndestination  data  provided  by  the  Government,  interview  stakeholders  (travelers,  traders, \ntransport operators, tourism agencies, and business communities) to elicit transport and travel \npreferences, constraints, and expectations in the sub-region. \n \n4.  Review Existing Plans and Reports. Review the existing national/regional economic \ndevelopment  plans  and  policy  initiatives,  which  are  relevant  to  supporting  subregional \ncooperation (including integrated development areas and regional development cooperation \ninitiatives)  and  national/regional  planning  studies/reports,  which  will  form  the  basis  for \nsubsequent analyses. Refer also to completed and ongoing studies. Identify the status of these \nplans and studies. \n \n5.  Hold Consultations. Discuss with the Government and other stakeholders subregional \ntransport  cooperation  strategies,  including  (i)  the  Government\u2019s  medium-and  long-term \nstrategies  and  development  plans  for  transport  subsectors;  (ii)  transport  and  development \nissues; (iii) status of policy reforms; (iv) recommendations of recent policy studies; and (v) \nlessons learned from previous strategies, projects, or other actions that have been taken. \n \n6.  Analyze  the  Transport  Scenario.  Following  review/update  of  existing  data  and \ninformation, analyze the future transport scenario. Define the gap between the future scenario \nand existing conditions.
