INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)1 Secretariat has requested the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to provide assistance to improve road safety in ASEAN in \naccordance with the directions of the ASEAN senior transport officials meeting in May 2011. \nADB fielded a reconnaissance mission in May 2011 to ascertain the road safety needs of the \nASEAN countries and to work with their representatives to determine the proposed scope of the \ntechnical assistance (TA).2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Road accidents cause around 1.3 million deaths and injure or disable as many as 50 \nmillion people around the world each year.3 Over 90% of these accidents occur in low- and \nmedium-income countries. Unless urgent action is taken, casualty numbers are expected to \nincrease by a further 80% by 2020. The United Nations (UN) has called on all its member \ncountries, its United Nations commissions, and multilateral agencies to address this urgent \nproblem. In 2010, the UN General Assembly declared a Decade of Action for Road Safety \n2011\u20132020 and set casualty reduction targets for each of its regions and member countries. \nThe UN has asked the World Health Organization to add road safety to AIDS, tuberculosis, and \nmalaria as one of the most urgent global health problems facing the world and to coordinate \nefforts to address it. \n \n3.  Rapid motorization, especially the explosive growth in motorcycle numbers, is creating \nserious and growing road safety problems in Asia and the Pacific. Among Asian developing \ncountries road accidents are now the second leading cause of premature death for the 5\u201314 \nyear  age group  and  the  leading  cause  of death for the  15\u201344  year age group,  the most \neconomically productive segment of the population. Road accidents have major impacts on \nhealth, poverty, social development, and economies in the countries of Asia and the Pacific. The \nproblem is particularly serious in ASEAN countries because of the very high proportion of \nmotorcycles in traffic (e.g., 95% in Viet Nam, 82% in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and \n78% in Cambodia). The economic development of ASEAN countries in particular has spurred \nrapid growth in the level of motorization and has resulted in a significant worsening of the road \nsafety  situation  and  increasing  road  crash  deaths  and  injuries.  In  2008,  police  in  ASEAN \ncountries reported 60,886 deaths and 226,427 injuries from road crashes. However, due to \npolice  underreporting,  the  actual  figures  may  be  significantly  higher.  Large  numbers  of \nhouseholds fall into a spiral of poverty and debt as a result of the loss of a wage earner, and the \nregion suffers recurring annual economic losses estimated at 2.2% of gross domestic product \n(around $28 billion) per year. Road accident casualties are preventable. There are well-proven \ninterventions and techniques used in countries that have already successfully addressed their \nsafety problems, and these could be adapted to assist ASEAN countries. Road safety is now \nincluded among specific actions to be undertaken by member countries as part of the ASEAN \nEconomic Community Blueprint.4 \n \n                                                \n1  ASEAN comprises Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, \nMyanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 November 2010. \n3  World  Health  Organization.  2004.

The TA will build on the work done under the regional TA for  Road Safety in the \nAssociation  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations, 5  which  achieved  substantial  results  during  its \nimplementation in 2003\u20132006. The TA helped the ASEAN countries to develop road safety \naction plans and to establish the multicountry Multisector Road Safety Special Working Group \n(MRSSWG) to coordinate and harmonize activities across the ASEAN countries. All of the 10 \nASEAN countries developed road safety action plans and implemented them to varying degrees. \nAs a result of the improved capacity developed under the TA, all of the countries independently \ndeveloped  follow-up  plans  to  the  road  safety  action  plans.  Another  result  of  the  TA  was \nimproved interministerial cooperation and involvement of agencies not previously involved in \nroad safety. The MRSSWG has facilitated improved cooperation on road safety issues among \nthe  member  countries  and  increased  sharing  of  safety  knowledge.  The  MRSSWG  has \ncontinued to hold annual meetings since the completion of the TA to discuss common issues \nand  concerns  about  road  safety  in  ASEAN  countries.  The  MRSSWG  also  facilitates  the \ndiscussion of road safety at the annual meetings of the ASEAN Land Transport Working Group, \nsenior transport officials, and ASEAN transport ministers. The TA completion report6 rated the \nproject successful and recommended further ADB efforts to improve road safety. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n5.  The impact of the TA will be improved road safety in the ASEAN region. The outcome of \nthe TA will be that the capacity of governments for addressing national and regional road safety \nissues in ASEAN is strengthened. \n \n6.  The TA strongly supports ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative, of which road safety is \na key component, and Strategy 2020.7 The TA will support Strategy 2020\u2019s goal of increasing \nregional integration and will utilize three of the drivers of change specified in Strategy 2020: \ngood governance and capacity development, knowledge solutions, and partnerships. The TA \nwill form part of ADB\u2019s contribution to the implementation of the UN Decade of Action for Road \nSafety 2011\u20132020. \n \n7.  Improving capacity in road safety through regional TA will maximize the effectiveness of \nADB\u2019s resources. The regional approach increases efficiency, as representatives from multiple \ncountries can participate in the same workshop simultaneously. It also contributes to ADB\u2019s goal \nof regional cooperation. As the ASEAN member countries are at different levels of development \non  the  road  safety  issues  to  be  addressed  by  the  TA,  e.g.,  motorcycle  safety  and  traffic \nenforcement, the TA will allow those at less advanced levels to learn from the experiences of \nthose that are at more advanced levels. The regional framework will also increase the ability of \nthe TA to attract involvement of developed member countries which have made great strides in \nimproving road safety, such as Japan. It will do this by providing a forum through which these \ndeveloped countries can provide lessons learned from their experience to multiple countries \nsimultaneously. The TA will also take advantage of synergies with ongoing and planned projects \nwith road safety components in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2002.

Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The outputs of the TA will be (i) strengthened capacity to monitor and analyze road \naccident data, (ii) strengthened capacity to implement road safety strategies, (iii) strengthened \ncapacity to address motorcycle safety issues, (iv) improved enforcement capacity of traffic \npolice, (v) a pipeline of road safety projects, and (vi) knowledge products disseminated publicly. \nASEAN  member  countries  have  expressed  strong  interest  in  achieving  these  outputs  and \nmaking them sustainable. The UN Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011\u20132020 will be a key \nfactor supporting sustainability as ASEAN member countries are striving to achieve the targets \nset forth in the UN declaration. In addition, the involvement of government agencies in different \nsectors, as well as nongovernment organizations and the private sector, will further contribute to \nthe sustainability of the outputs.  \n \n9.  To achieve these outputs, the following key activities will be undertaken under the TA:  \n(i)  The capacity of safety professionals to (a) analyze crash data to understand the \nscale,  nature,  and  characteristics  of  road  safety  problems;  and  (b)  develop, \nimplement,  and  monitor  remedial  measures  to  improve  road  safety  will  be \nstrengthened.  This  includes  assessment  of  present  crash  data  systems  and \nsystematic training of key personnel in data analysis and use of crash data in \ndeveloping and monitoring remedial measures. \n(ii)  Donor  and  development  partner  activities  will  be  coordinated,  and  advice, \nsupport,  and  training  provided  to  implementing  agencies  in  ASEAN  at  the \nnational  and  regional  level  to  (a)  update  their  current  action  plans  and  the \nregional  strategy,  and  (b)  establish  improved  monitoring  and  performance \nmanagement  systems.  This  will  facilitate  effective  monitoring  of  the  country-\nspecific action plans, the regional action plan, and targets.  \n(iii)  The capacity to address motorcycle safety issues will be strengthened by sharing \nand disseminating experiences and expertise of ASEAN countries which have \nmade significant improvements in motorcycle safety, e.g., wearing of helmets in \nViet  Nam,  and  transferring  such  initiatives  and  techniques  to  other  ASEAN \ncountries.  \n(iv)  The enforcement capacity of traffic police will be improved by introducing modern \ndata-led policing methods and practices and training traffic police personnel in \nappropriate enforcement tactics and strategies. This will require (a) adapting \ntraffic policing courses previously implemented in Malaysia and Cambodia, (b) \ncentrally training a core group of police instructors from ASEAN countries, and \n(c) mentoring the trained police instructors as they implement training courses in \ntheir home countries.  \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2011.

The following crosscutting tasks will be utilized in implementing the TA activities:   \n(i)  quantify training and human resource development needs across the region; \n(ii)  identify  locations  where  joint  train-the-trainer  courses,  research,  and  safety \ninitiatives can be developed for application across ASEAN countries; \n(iii)  develop  a  series  of  train-the-trainer  courses  covering  the  key  issues  (e.g., \nmotorcycle safety, data analysis, traffic police enforcement) to be addressed; \nafter training the trainers in a central course, assist them to run the initial in-\ncountry courses and demonstration projects to establish such courses in each \ncountry; \n(iv)  assist countries to develop and implement demonstration and pilot projects on \ncommunity motorcycle safety and safe routes to school;  \n(v)  develop training materials and manuals centrally by bringing key international \nand local ASEAN experts together to modify and adapt such materials from other \ncountries for application in ASEAN countries; and \n(vi)  coordinate closely with the private sector, nongovernment organizations, and \nother agencies involved with road safety to maximize project effectiveness. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction in the \namount of $1,500,000 equivalent, and administered by ADB. The participating governments will \nprovide in-kind contributions in the form of office accommodation, transport, remuneration and \nper diem of counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA,  with  its  Southeast  Asia  Department \nresponsible  for  implementation.  The  ASEAN  Secretariat  and  MRSSWG  working  under  the \nSenior Transport Officials Committee will act as the steering committee for the TA. The national \nroad safety committees in the ASEAN countries have been involved in defining priorities for the \nproject  and  will  be  closely  involved  in  implementing  the  TA.  Use  of  the  internet  and \ntelecommunications  will  be  encouraged  to  facilitate  sustainable  knowledge  sharing  and \ntechnical cooperation across ASEAN. The TA is expected to commence on 1 July 2012 and will \nbe implemented over a period of 24 months through 30 June 2014. Disbursements under the \nTA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas amended from time to time). \n  \n13.  ADB  will  finance  consulting  services  of  78  person-months  (24  international  and  54 \nnational) which will be procured through recruitment of individual consultants. An international \nsenior road safety advisor and team leader will work on an intermittent basis over the 24-month \nproject period. The team leader will be supported by short-term international experts who will \nlead workshops and training courses. The national consultants will work intermittently within the \n ", "5 \n \nASEAN  countries.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  The \ninternational and national consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The consultants will be recruited \nas individuals to ensure that the most qualified experts in the specific fields of road safety are \nrecruited. Procurement of equipment and goods will be carried out in compliance with ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Equipment procured under the \nTA will be turned over to the ASEAN Secretariat or ASEAN member countries upon completion \nof the TA. \n \n14.  Dissemination of the outputs of the TA as knowledge products will be a key activity of \nthe TA. The TA consultants will (i) conduct an overall review of materials to be prepared for \nplanned activities that will be suitable for publication, and (ii) prepare a knowledge product \npreparation and dissemination plan. During preparation of plans for the achievement of each \noutput, e.g., training sessions and demonstration projects, the consultants will analyze the \npotential contribution that could be made by knowledge products that could be produced from \nthat activity. During and after implementation of each relevant activity,  the consultants will \nprepare the knowledge products and disseminate them through the ADB website and as ADB \npublications, and also through media, governments, and other means in the ASEAN countries. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Improving Road Safety in the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nData Sources \nDesign  Performance Targets and Indicators with  and Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Baselines  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact  By June 2016:    Assumption \nImproved road  Brunei Darussalam: Reduce deaths per 100,000  World Health  No major \nsafety in ASEAN  head of population from 18.32 in 2010 to 14.26.
