In recognition of the growing significance of Islamic finance among Asian Development \nBank (ADB) developing member countries (DMCs), ADB joined the Islamic Financial Services \nBoard (IFSB) as an observer member in December 2003.  IFSB is established as a standard \nsetter for the Islamic financial sector, and provides a forum for supervisory and regulatory bodies \nand financial institutions offering Islamic financial services to discuss key issues on regulation and \nsupervision.  ADB  and  IFSB  began  discussions  on  the  potential  for  collaboration  in  the \ndevelopment of international prudential standards for the supervision of Islamic financial services, \nand a technical assistance (TA) proposal1 was developed. Based upon discussions with IFSB \nand  the  recommendations  of  the  international  seminar  on  \u201cChallenges  Facing  the  Islamic \nFinancial Services Industry\u201d  organized by the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), International \nMonetary Fund (IMF), and IFSB, the TA focuses on (i) developing sound international prudential \nstandards,  (ii) reviewing  and  assessing  IFSB  member  data  to  support  analyses  for  the \ndevelopment of appropriate prudential standards, and (iii) assisting the  development of legal \nframeworks for Islamic finance. A TA framework is provided in Appendix 1. \n  \nII.  BACKGROUND \n \n2.  Islamic finance has gained significant attention in recent years due to its size, fast paced \ngrowth, and the potential impact on the international financial markets.  Estimates for worldwide \nIslamic finance range from $230 billion to nearly $250 billion. With a projected annual growth rate \nin assets of 12- 15% or higher, the market potential has been estimated at close to 10% of global \ngross domestic project (GDP).2  Over 240 Islamic financial institutions have been counted in more \nthan  48  countries.  Islamic  banking  and  finance  is  growing  rapidly  worldwide  and  Islamic \ninstitutions  operate  in  75  countries.  Islamic  finance  encompasses  banking,  mutual  funds, \nsecurities firms, insurance companies, and other nonbank institutions. Islamic capital invested in \nglobal financial institutions is currently estimated at $1.3 trillion, and over 105 Islamic equity funds \nglobally are managing assets in excess of $3.5 billion.3 A study by the Association of Islamic \nBanks4 indicates that, as of 1997, 29% of Islamic banks were in South Asia, 20% in Africa, 18% \nin Southeast Asia, 15% in the Middle East, 12% in the Cooperation Council of the Arab States of \nthe Gulf (GCC) countries,5 5% in Europe and America, and 1% in other Asian countries. The \nstudy indicates that almost 50% of the Islamic banks are in the Asian region. \n \n3.  Although there were few Islamic banks in the mid-1970s, there is now a proliferation of \nIslamic  institutions  and  a  trend  for  mainstreaming  with  traditional  finance.  To  tap  into  the \nsignificant business markets and to meet the increasing demands of customers, a growing \nnumber of conventional financial institutions are offering Islamic products and creating specialized \nIslamic subsidiaries. Foreign-based banks, finance companies, merchant banks, and discount \nhouses are actively seeking to offer Islamic finance services as alternatives to conventional \nservices.  One indicator of the high market demand for investment according to Islamic rules and \nprinciples is the Dow Jones family of Islamic Market Indexes. These indexes were created to \nfacilitate investment in stocks compliant with Shari'a (Islamic Law) around the world. Dow Jones \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 29 April 2004. \n2  El-Hawary, Dahlia, Wafik Grais, and Zamir Iqbal. 2004.

", "2  \nnow has 31 Islamic Market Indexes and, as of March 2004, 1,667 stocks were included in the \nglobal index.   \n \n4.  Among the differences between Islamic and conventional finance, two features define \nIslamic finance.  \n \n(i)  Risk-sharing. The lender must share in the borrower\u2019s risk. Fixed, predetermined \ninterest rates are considered exploitative, socially unproductive, and economically \nwasteful. The preferred mode of financing is profit and loss sharing. Alternatives \ninclude imposing fixed service charges or acting as buying agents for clients. \n \n(ii)  Promotion  of  economic  and  social  development.  Development  is  promoted \nthrough various business practices and almsgiving  (zakat). Conventional finance \ntypically  focuses  on  profit-maximization  within  a  given  regulatory  framework, \nwhereas Islamic finance is also guided by these other Islamic principles.   \n \n5.  Beyond the appeal of compliance with Islamic law, Islamic finance is important in its \ncapacity to offer alternative financing routes for projects (Appendix 2). The special characteristics \nof Islamic finance can provide alternative means to reaching underserved groups such as small, \nrural, and agricultural producers. Projects that could be turned down by conventional banks due \nto a lack of collateral, may be financed by Islamic banks on a profit-sharing basis. In this regard, \nIslamic finance can catalyze economic development and reduce poverty.   \n \n6.  Islamic finance is a growing area among a number of ADB DMCs. For example, as stated \nin Indonesia\u2019s Economic Policy Package Pre and Post IMF6 announced in 2003. This \u201cWhite \nPaper\u201d clearly establishes development of Islamic banking as a goal for 2004, and follows on the \nBlueprint  of  Islamic  Banking  Development  in  Indonesia7  published  in  2002  by  the  banking \nregulatory authority, Bank Indonesia. The Indonesian Government White Paper also addresses \nthe capital markets, and includes development of Shari'a products as a priority. In the Philippines, \nattention is turning to the Islamic market as an important potential source of raising public funds. \nThe General Banking Law of 2000 includes Islamic banking and strengthens the legislative \nframework in the Philippines for development in this sector.       \n \n7.  IFSB will provide an important strategic channel for effective delivery of the TA. IFSB, \nestablished  in  2002,  is  an  association  of  central  banks,  monetary  agencies,  and  inter-\ngovernmental international organizations. IFSB's secretariat office is in Kuala Lumpur. IFSB \ncurrently has 52 members, including members from ADB DMCs. An organization chart and list of \nIFSB members are included in Appendix 3. IFSB was established with assistance from IDB and \nIMF, and its main  objective is to promote, disseminate, and harmonize the best practices in \nregulating and supervising  Islamic financial services. IFSB sets and disseminates international \nprudential and supervisory standards and core principles that are in compliance with Islamic rules \nand principles for regulation and supervision. IFSB promotes harmonization of regulations across \nborders, and, although the process is voluntary, it is expected that market disciplines will make it \nnecessary for jurisdictions to comply. IFSB coordinates closely with international standard-setting \nbodies  and  Islamic  financial  institutions,  and  promotes  good  practices  in  risk  management \nthrough research, training, and TA. A core objective of IFSB is to develop for the Islamic financial \nservices industry the criteria for identifying, measuring, managing, and disclosing risks, taking into \naccount international standards for valuation, income and expense calculation, and disclosure. \n                                                 \n6  Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs. 2003.

The fast pace of growth in the Islamic financial sector and the emergence of conventional \nfinance companies offering Islamic products and services has brought critical attention to key \nissues facing this sector.  Some of the core issues identified include the following:     \n  \n9.  Insufficient  Regulatory  and  Supervisory  Framework.  A  robust  regulatory  and \nsupervisory framework is necessary to maintain financial stability and growth of Islamic finance as \na  viable,  resilient,  and  sustainable  sector.  The  unique  characteristics  of  Islamic  banking \noperations and Islamic financial instruments require the development of a regulatory-supervisory \nframework that adequately addresses the requirements of this industry. Due to its specificity, the \noperations entail unique risks that  require adjustments in the capital adequacy ratios, more \ndisclosures and transparency, and other modifications of prudential and supervision norms. In \nestablishing international prudential standards for Islamic finance, financial \u201cloopholes\u201d or gaps \nshould not be created that would allow regulatory arbitrage among finance institutions.  \n \n10.  Lack of Market Transparency. Increased market transparency  is needed to enhance \ncredibility and increase consumer confidence. The application of relevant international accounting \nstandards will enhance transparency of Islamic financial institutions and the comparability of \nfinancial statements. At this stage, Islamic product standards and accounting practices are not yet \naccepted globally. \n \n11.  Lack  of  Reliable  and  Comparable  Statistical  Information.  Reliable  statistical \ninformation on a comparable basis is critical for essential research to support the development of \nappropriate standards for Islamic financial sector. \n  \n12.  Insufficient Legal Framework for Islamic Financial Services. The legal framework for \nthe Islamic financial services industry needs to be developed. Appropriate legal framework and \ntrust laws do not exist in most IDB member countries, although Islamic bonds (sukuk), which are \nbased on trust laws, are an increasingly important means of mobilizing funds by the public sector \nand corporate entities.  \n \n13.  Need for Education on Prudential Standards. Increased education is needed to ensure \nthat standards are understood and accepted across the industry by regulators, international \norganizations, and the private sector. \n \nIV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n14.  The overall goal of the TA is to promote financial stability and sound markets in the fast \ngrowing Islamic financial sector in ADB DMCs by establishing international prudential standards \nfor Islamic banks and financial institutions and a robust regulatory and supervisory framework. \nThe TA aims to increase transparency in the financial markets and establish comparability of \nfinancial institutions data and transactions by developing harmonized standards and a public \ninformation database on the Islamic financial sector. The TA will also support the development of \na sound Islamic financial sector legal framework, and will assist the design of a management \ninformation system for the Islamic financial sector database to be maintained by IFSB. \n \n ", "4  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will be conducted in consultation and coordination with IFSB staff and members \nincluding IDB, IMF, World Bank, and the Bank for International Settlements. IFSB, through its \ntechnical committees and working groups, will continue to provide a forum for discussion of key \nissues  in  the  development  of  international  standards.  ADB  in  cooperation  with  IFSB  will \ncoordinate closely with other multilateral and bilateral agencies including IMF, World Bank, and \nFinancial Sector Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) Initiative8 for strategic utilization of resources \nand sequencing of assistance. \n \n16.  The key TA activities include the following: \n \n(i)  Identify supervisory and regulatory issues for soundness and stability of the Islamic \nfinancial  sector,  including  the  potential  for  regulatory  arbitrage,  and  make \nrecommendations  for  strengthening  frameworks  and  additional  standards  to  be \ndeveloped. \n \n(ii)  Assist IFSB to develop international prudential standards for the Islamic financial \nservices sector in close collaboration with the Bank for International Settlements who \nis a member of IFSB. Standards currently under development at IFSB include capital \nadequacy (exposure draft to be issued at the end of 2004), risk management \n(exposure draft to be issued at the end of 2004), and corporate governance. The TA \nwould provide assistance in drafting an international standard on transparency and \nmarket discipline, and provide inputs into finalizing the three other draft standards \nthrough the evaluation of cross-country data as noted below. \n \n(iii)  Assess the compliance of applicable international accounting standards to IFSB \nmembers' data and recommend adjustment factors, if needed, to ensure effective \ncomparability across countries and jurisdictions. Apply adjustment factors to data as \nneeded. \n \n(iv)  Analyze the cross-country data collected by IFSB from its members and related \nagencies and any adjusted data to identify key characteristics and trends to support \nthe  formulation  of  appropriate  international  prudential  standards  for  the  Islamic \nfinancial sector. Data will be collected from IFSB full members (central banks) as \nwell as any associate or observer members that agree to provide information.  \n \n(v)  Prepare, in consultation with IFSB members and related agencies, key principles for \nthe development of an appropriate legal framework (including trust law and contract \nlaw) to be used by IFSB in promoting harmonized legal systems across diverse legal \njurisdictions. \n \n(vi)  Prepare a report on key developments in innovation in Islamic financial services and \nproducts by region, and initiate and foster key innovative Islamic financial products \nand  services  through  development  and  adaptation  in  banking  supervision  and \nregulations, as needed.  \n \n                                                 \n8  The Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) Initiative is a $53 million multi-donor program supporting \ncapacity building and policy development projects in the financial sectors in developing countries. Funding agencies \ninclude Canadian International Development Agency, Department for International Development (United Kingdom), \nFederal Department of Public Economy (Switzerland), and World Bank, among others. FIRST Initiative will provide \n$176,000 in 2004 to assist in the development of a corporate governance standard.  ", "  5\n(vii)  Provide  international  workshop  forums  for  the  further  education  of  regulators, \ninternational  organizations,  and  the  private  sector  on  international  prudential \nstandards and the best practices for the industry. Organize an international seminar \non legal issues in Islamic financial services industry.  \n \n(viii)  Provide recommendations, in consultation with IFSB staff and members, for the \ndesign of a management information system for a sustainable IFSB database. \nReporting systems will include IFSB reports for public access as well as confidential \ninternal IFSB reporting for members. IFSB will publish aggregated Islamic finance \nsector data and selected nonconfidential individual data assessed under the TA, and \nthen will publish industry data annually.    \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $400,000 consisting entirely of foreign exchange. \nADB  will  provide  $400,000  equivalent,  on  a  grant  basis,  from  ADB's  TA  funding  program. \nPossible Islamic Development Bank (IDB) cofinancing up to $200,000 is under discussion. When \ncofinancing is confirmed, it will replace the corresponding funds from ADB's TA funding program. \nThe TA will finance the services of 14 person-months of international consulting services to be \nimplemented over 12 months. Activities are expected to commence in September 2004 and to be \ncompleted by August 2005. The consultants will include a senior financial sector supervisory and \nregulatory expert, a senior financial analyst-accounting expert, and a senior legal expert. The \ndetails of the TA costs and financing plan are provided in Appendix 4. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The Implementing Agency will be IFSB. All \nconsultants will be recruited and engaged on an individual basis and in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are provided \nin  Appendix  5.  Public  workshops  will  be  held  in  IFSB  member  countries  to  disseminate \ninformation  and  findings  under  the  TA,  including  the  proposed  prudential  standards.  The \nworkshops will include all participating agencies and countries and interested public and private \nsector parties. IFSB will publish the aggregated data from members and selected individual \ncountry data and produce a public industry report on an annual basis. IFSB will maintain a public \ndatabase on the industry with free international access to promoting a better understanding and \nassessment of the Islamic financial markets, trends, and potential impact. \n \n19.  The TA will be monitored and reviewed by ADB missions; regular communications with \nIFSB; and the inception, midterm, interim, and final reports. The inception report will be submitted \nto ADB and IFSB within 1 month of commencement of activity, the midterm report within 6 \nmonths, the interim report within 9 months, and the final report within 12 months. \n \nV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Development of International Prudential Standards for Islamic Financial Services, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", " \n6\n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nA\nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators/Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks  p\np\ne\nGoal        n\nd\nThe development of Islamic  \u2022  Economies and institutions  Economic and publicly available    ix\n 1\nfinance as a viable, sustainable  acceptance of, and  progress reports of the Islamic   \nalternative finance mode that can  compliance with, international  Financial Services Board (IFSB), \ncatalyze economic development  prudential standards for  its IFSB members, and other \nand reduce poverty.

Origin and History \n \n1.  Islamic financing was practiced throughout the Middle Ages predominately in the Muslim \nworld to foster trade and business activities. Islamic merchants were known as middlemen in \nSpain, the Mediterranean, and the Baltic States for their trading activities, and techniques and \ninstruments of Islamic finance were later adopted by European financiers and businessmen.1  In \nrecent  history,  the  start  of  formal  Islamic  financial  institutions  is  often  marked  by  the \nestablishment of the Mitghamr Egypt Savings Institution in 1963. Although the growth in Islamic \nfinance is considered to have coincided with the current account surpluses of oil-exporting \nIslamic countries, its continued growth is rooted in a desire for sociopolitical and economic \nsystems  based  on  Islamic  principles.  These  include  risk  sharing,  the  promotion  of \nentrepreneurship, and the prohibition of riba or a predetermined guaranteed rate of return or \ninterest. The set of rules and law governing Islamic societies is collectively referred to as Shari\u2019a \n(Islamic law), and only business activities that are Shari\u2019a compliant qualify for investment. For \nexample, businesses dealing with alcohol, gambling, and casinos are prohibited. Elements of \nmicrofinance are considered consistent with the broader goals of Islamic banking and finance2 \nincluding the advocacy of entrepreneurship, risk sharing, disbursement of collateral free loans, \nand participation by the poor.  \n \n2.  With over 1 billion Muslims worldwide and annual growth rates in Islamic finance up to \n15%, the potential for this sector is considered vast. The current market has been estimated at \nup to $250 billion and close to 10% of global gross domestic product (GDP),3 with Islamic \nfinancial institutions operating in 75 countries. The number of Islamic financial institutions in all \ncountries is unknown, however, over 240 Islamic financial institutions have been counted in \nmore than 48 countries. In some countries, such as Iran and Sudan, all financial institutions are \nconsidered to be in conformity with Shari\u2019a. However, in other countries, such as Bangladesh, \nEgypt, Indonesia, Jordan, and Malaysia, Islamic banking exists along with conventional banking \nand finance. A number of global financial institutions offer instruments conforming to Shari\u2019a \nthrough Islamic windows and the establishment of separate banks, branches, or subsidiaries \nspecializing  in  Islamic  financial  products. Global financial institutions that have established \nIslamic banking with Shari\u2019a compatible services include Citibank, BNP Paribas, and UBS.4  No \nuniform regulatory and legal framework for an Islamic financial system has been developed and \nIslamic banks form their own boards for guidance.   \n \nB.  Islamic Modes of Financing \n \n3.  Islamic banks borrow through savings accounts and time deposits with a revenue- \nsharing package. Deposit accounts include (i) current accounts and demand deposits where \ncapital is guaranteed, is available for withdrawal at any time, and involves no payment to the \nclient on the deposit; and (ii) investment accounts where deposits remain with the bank for an \n                                                 \n1  Iqbal, Zamir. 1997.

Under a joint venture or limited liability partnership, two or \nmore partners combine capital and efforts and share in the risk and financial results. This is not \na common financing mode among Islamic banks, as the banks are typically not involved with \nenterprise management. \n \n5.  Trust Financing (mudaraba). Trust financing is a partnership comprising a financing \npartner  who  contributes  capital  and  a  managing  partner  who  contributes  knowledge  and \nentrepreneurial skills. The financing partner is not involved in management, which makes this a \npreferred mode for banks. Profits are shared on a predetermined ratio, although losses are only \nborn by the financing partner unless caused by irresponsible behavior of the managing partner. \nTrust  financing  in  farming  (muzar'ah)  involves  harvest-sharing  between  the  bank  and  the \nentrepreneur, and the bank may provide funds or land. \n \n6.  Equity Financing  (musharaka) is a form of trust financing. Equity participation in \norchards (musaqat) involves harvest-sharing among the partners based on their contributions. \n \n  2.  Non-Profit-and-Loss Sharing Modes \n \n7.  Mark-Up Financing (murabaha). Mark-up, or cost-plus, financing is a common form of \ntrade financing. The agreement is between the final buyer and a middleman/trader. The final \nbuyer asks the middleman to buy a certain object for an agreed price that includes the purchase \nprice, costs of the middleman, and a profit margin. Mark-up financing and other forms of trade \nfinancing are popular financing instruments among Islamic banks, and account for more than \n75% of financing provided in some cases.5  The popularity is due to the short-term nature of the \nfinancing, limited risk, and guaranteed profit. Islamic law allows a buyer to cancel a deal at any \ntime. \n \n8.  Lease and Lease Purchases (ijara and ijara wa iqtina). Under a lease arrangement a \nproduct is used for a specified period for a specified amount without taking ownership of the \nproduct. Under a lease- purchase arrangement, payments include a portion applied toward the \nfinal purchase of the product and ownership is transferred at the end of the lease period.  \n \n9.  Deferred Payment Sales (bai'mua'jjal). Deferred payment sales allow products to be \npurchased in installment payments or in a lump sum at a later date.  \n \n10.  Purchase with Deferred Delivery (bai'salam or  bai'salaf).  Under purchases with \ndeferred delivery, the buyer pays the full price on the delivery date. This mode is typically \napplied to agricultural or manufactured products.  \n \n11.  Beneficence Loans (qard hassana).  Beneficence loans are zero-return loans (no \ninterest or profit) to the needy. Service fees can be charged to cover administrative expenses, \nbut should not be linked to loan amount or maturity. \n                                                 \n5  Thomas A. Timberg. 2003.

The  proposed  technical  assistance  is  designed  to  support  the  development  of  a \ncomprehensive  database  on  Islamic  banking  and  finance  and  sector  analyses  based  on \ncomparable  cross-country  data.  As  there  is  no  standard  definition  for  what  is  counted  in \nstatistics for Islamic finance, and data for Islamic windows in commercial banks and financial \ninstitutions  may  not  be  reported  on  a  separate  basis,  studies  may  underestimate  the \nconcentration  of  Islamic  finance  in  some  countries.
