INTRODUCTION \n1.   The Government of Solomon Islands has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto  provide  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  strengthen  its  country  safeguard  systems  (CSS) \nframework and implementation capacity in the transport sector.1  The government, development \npartners,  and  stakeholders  were  consulted  during  an  ADB  mission  in  June  2012.2 The \ngovernment has agreed on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, \nfinancing,  and  terms  of  reference  for  the  proposed  TA.  The  TA  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.    ISSUES \n2.  Solomon Islands is one of the largest Pacific developing member countries of ADB. The \nNational Development Strategy, 2011\u20132020 emphasizes integrating environmental and social \nprotection into projects.4 The National Transport Plan, 2011\u20132030 calls for (i) minimizing the \nenvironmental and social impacts of the transport network, (ii) ensuring that people are not \nunduly affected by transport projects, and (iii) developing and applying relevant laws to follow \nproper processes.5 The Ministry of Infrastructure Development (MID) is primarily responsible for \ninfrastructure  development.  The  Ministry  of  Environment,  Climate  Change,  Disaster \nManagement, and Meteorology (MECCDM) and the Ministry of Land, Housing, and Survey \n(MLHS) are responsible for managing environmental and land aspects. \n \n3.  ADB has assisted the government, particularly MID, in implementing transport projects \nfinanced  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners  by  enabling  projects\u2019  adherence  to \nsafeguard. 6  Safeguard  mechanisms  and  procedures  have  been  integrated  into  project \nmanagement structures, and project staff are developing skills for implementing safeguards. For \nexample, the Road Improvement (Sector) Project (footnote 6) included safeguard specialists, \nwho trained national counterpart staff and assisted in implementing safeguard procedures. The \nTransport Sector Development Project (footnote 6) will further build capacity in MID to adhere to \nsafeguards at the project level and consolidate the sector approach for project management \nthrough a centralized project implementation unit.   \n \n                                                \n1  CSS are a country\u2019s legal and institutional framework, consisting of its implementing institutions and relevant laws, \nregulations, rules, and procedures that pertain to the policy areas of environmental and social safeguards. CSS \nand \u201csafeguards\u201d in this document pertain particularly to environment assessment and resettlement. \n2  Fact-finding  for  the  TA  was  undertaken  in  conjunction  with  the  review  mission  for  the  Transport  Sector \nDevelopment Project (footnote 6) and the fact-finding mission for ADB. 2012.

The government has established the National Transport Fund to implement the National \nTransport Plan and has asked development partners to channel funds for transport projects \nthrough this mechanism using country systems.7 This is a step towards adopting a sector-wide \napproach  to  transport  and  presents  an  excellent  opportunity  for  the  government  and  its \ndevelopment  partners  to  harmonize  safeguards  and  other  matters  by  developing  common \nframeworks,  structures,  and  capacities  within  the  sector\u2014consolidating  experiences  and \ncapacities gained from projects.  \n \n5.  However, there are several challenges to implementing a sector-wide approach reliant \non country systems. The CSS framework does not currently address several aspects that the \nsafeguard policies of development partners such as ADB, Japan International Cooperation \nAgency, and the World Bank consider essential.8 MID, MECCDM, and MLHS lack sufficient \ncapacity and resources to effectively implement and monitor CSS.9 Staff members of these \nagencies have only limited experience in safeguard assessment, preparing safeguard plans, or \nimplementing  or  monitoring  them.  Weak  institutional  capacity  on  CSS  presents  several \nchallenges  to  implementing  safeguards  in  projects,  whether  funded  externally  or  by  the \ngovernment. As safeguard requirements so far have been developed mainly in the management \nstructures of externally funded projects, safeguard outcomes vary across projects. Overarching \nsector  guidelines  are  urgently  needed  to  achieve  a  consistent  approach  across  transport \nprojects and strengthen sector institutions. \n \n6.  Land acquisition has commonly been problematic. The government has little experience \nwith formal land acquisition and compensation in the transport sector.10 MID has emphasized \nthat all future projects need to be developed by applying proper land acquisition procedures. \nThis  process  is  new  to  many  government  staff,  so  they  need  capacity  building  on  land \nacquisition and compensation processes and on the differences and similarities between CSS \nand development partners\u2019 safeguard requirements. There are challenges in environmental \nsafeguards as well. These include inadequate capacity to assess, plan, implement, and monitor \nenvironmental requirements in compliance with the CSS framework and development partners\u2019 \nsafeguard policies.  \n \n7.  The government plans to meet these challenges by strengthening the CSS framework \nand building capacity in key ministries. It has requested ADB to provide the TA to review CSS, \nassess institutional capacity, prepare an action plan, and implement training and capacity-\nbuilding initiatives. The government has chosen transport as the first sector for strengthening \nCSS. Projects in other sectors such as energy and mining will benefit from the strengthened \nCSS framework and the improved implementation capacity of MID, MECCDM, and MLHS, \nwhich are responsible for all infrastructure and related safeguards. \n \n                                                \n7  The National Transport Fund currently covers most transport projects, but some projects still operate outside of it.    \n8  Gaps have been identified in information disclosure, grievance redress, compensation to non-titleholders, restoring \nthe livelihoods of affected people, and compliance monitoring. A detailed analysis comparing the CSS framework \nwith international standards is proposed under the TA. \n9  The Environment and Conservation Division of MECCDM has a total staff of 12, but only 6 are available to review \nenvironmental assessments or monitor impacts. MID currently has no safeguards staff but is expected under \nprovisions of the Transport Sector Development Project to create two new safeguard staff positions. MLHS has \nabout 15 staff, but most have received no safeguards training and are not involved in MID projects.  \n10  The process adopted in the past for obtaining land was through an informal memorandum of understanding, which \nrequired agreements from customary landowners and communities to develop a project without compensation to \naffected individuals. This has not worked well for various reasons: some groups have not agreed or wanted to \nrenegotiate previous agreements; MID and its contractors have been inundated with requests for in-kind works \nbeyond initial agreements; and individuals within communities have sought cash compensation. \n ", "  3 \nIII.     THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be transport projects implemented in an environmentally and \nsocially responsible manner. This will be measured by the percentage of transport projects \nadopting the improved environmental and social safeguard systems. \n \n9.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  will  be  the  improved  CSS  framework  and  implementation \ncapacity on environmental and social safeguards in the transport sector. This will be measured \nby  (i)  the  number  of  staff  of  MID,  MECCDM,  MLHS,  and  other  agencies  trained  on \nenvironmental and social safeguards and (ii) the availability to transport projects of  sector \nguidelines for environmental assessment and for land acquisition and resettlement. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will comprise the following four outputs and key activities to achieve the outcome.  \n \n11.  Output 1: Country safeguard systems review. The CSS review will include (i) analysis \ncomparing  Solomon  Islands\u2019  CSS  framework  with  international  best  practices,  and  (ii) \nrecommendations to enhance CSS\u2019 consistency with them. An inventory of laws, decrees, \nregulations,  and  other  mandates  related  to  environmental  and  social  safeguards  will  be \ncompiled with a focus on transport. The laws in other sectors will be reviewed if they directly \nrelate to the objective of the TA. Aspirational policy statements, such as those found in the \nConstitution or sector policies, will be inventoried for their potential alignment with international \nbest  practices.  Legal  instruments  in  draft  form  such  as  bills  and  draft  regulations  will  be \nidentified as potential measures for CSS strengthening. The comparative analysis of Solomon \nIslands\u2019  CSS  framework  with  international  best  practices  on  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards will use the methodology for strengthening CSS set out in ADB\u2019s guidance note for \nreview of CSS. The analysis will reference ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) as a \nbenchmark.  \n \n12.  Output 2: Institutional capacity assessment. The TA will assess the ability of MID, \nMECCDM,  and  MLHS  to  implement  CSS  by  assessing  their (i)  capacity  in  terms  of their \nresponsibilities, resources and tools; (ii) existing implementation practices and procedures; and \n(iii) performance on environmental and social safeguards. This component will include a training \nneeds assessment to determine recommendations and activities to be included in outputs 3 and \n4. Selected case studies will highlight what is being done in transport projects and what should \nbe  done  to  improve  implementation  capacity.  This  component  will  be  designed  without \nduplicating support provided under other projects. \n \n13.  Workshops will be organized to discuss draft reports on the CSS review (output 1) and \nthe institutional capacity assessment (output 2). The objective is to identify key issues and reach \nconsensus on recommended actions among government agencies, development partners, civil \nsociety organizations, and other stakeholders. The final reports on the CSS review and the \ncapacity  assessment  will  incorporate  comments  received  during  the  workshop  and  other \nconsultations. \n \n14.  Output 3: Action plan for strengthening country safeguard systems framework \nand implementation capacity. A draft action plan will be prepared based on outputs 1 and 2 \narticulating a set of interventions to improve the CSS framework and develop the capacity of \n ", "4   \nMID, MECCDM, MLHS, and other agencies to implement environmental and social safeguards \nin the transport sector. The draft action plan will be discussed with stakeholders, including \ngovernment  agencies,  development  partners,  and  civil  society  organizations.  Consultation \nworkshops in the form of facilitated discussions will arrive at an action plan by consensus. \nDevelopment partners will be invited to consultation workshops to provide their views and clarify \nhow they can support the action plan. The final action plan will take into account the results of \nstakeholder consultations and be submitted to the government for endorsement. Some priority \ncapacity-building activities identified in the action plan (e.g., training and developing guidelines) \nwill be implemented under the TA as output 4. Other activities will be implemented subsequently \nby the government or other projects.   \n \n15.  Output 4: Training and capacity building initiatives. Based on the findings of the \ntraining needs assessment and priorities in the action plan (output 3), the TA will conduct a \nseries of institutional strengthening activities to build the capacity of MID, MLHS, MECCDM, \nother ministries, and stakeholders to implement CSS. The TA will (i) raise government agencies\u2019 \nand  stakeholders\u2019  awareness  of  CSS  and  international  safeguard  standards;  (ii)  conduct \nworkshops, on-the-job training linked with existing projects, and intensive training courses on \nsafeguards; (iii) develop transport sector guidelines for environmental assessment and for land \nacquisition and resettlement; and (iv) pursue other activities prioritized in the action plan. The \nTA  will  explore  opportunities  and  coordinate  with  development  partners  to share  Solomon \nIslands\u2019 experience on CSS strengthening with other countries in the region. A recommendation \nto share knowledge on CSS nationally and regionally will be included in the action plan. \n \n16.  The  TA  outputs  will  be  published  on  the  ADB  website  and  will  be  provided  to \ngovernment agencies and other stakeholders for public dissemination. This will showcase TA \noutputs  and  encourage  agencies  in  Solomon  Islands  and  abroad  to  share  lessons  and \nexperiences on CSS strengthening.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of office accommodation, counterpart staff and other in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months, from 1 April 2013 to 30 September 2014. \n \n19.  MID will be the executing agency and will be responsible for overseeing and monitoring \nTA implementation. It has implemented several transport projects financed by ADB and other \ndevelopment partners and has a satisfactory track record in project implementation. MECCDM, \nMLHS, and other agencies will actively participate in implementing the TA. A working group will \nbe established to coordinate TA activities. It will be chaired by the MID permanent secretary, or \nhis  or  her  representative,  and  will  comprise  representatives  of  MECCDM,  MLHS,  other \nministries, development partners, and stakeholders. The detailed terms of reference of the \nworking group will be finalized during the inception mission. The TA consultants will provide \nnecessary support to the working group. \n \n20.  The  TA  will  require  a  total  of  40  person-months  of  consulting  services.  Three \ninternational consultants providing a total of 15 person-months and two national consultants \n ", "  5 \nproviding a total of 25 person-months will form the TA team. The international consultants will \nlead TA activities in their respective safeguard areas of expertise: environment safeguards, \nresettlement safeguards, and legal aspects. National consultants will assist in assessing CSS, \nconducting case studies in the transport sector, planning activities, and implementing the TA. \nThe international environmental safeguard specialist will be the TA team leader, coordinating TA \nactivities and serving as the secretary to the working group. The national safeguard specialist \nwill be the acting secretary of the working group when the team leader is not present. ADB will \nrecruit the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). A consulting firm will be selected using the simplified technical \nproposal through the quality- and cost-based selection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 \nbecause of the complexity of the assignment. The terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix  3.  Disbursements  will  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Any procurement of equipment will follow \nADB Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n21.   The consultants will prepare the following reports on all activities and outputs under the \nTA: (i) an inception report within 4 weeks of the start of the TA consisting of a work program, \nmethodology, and milestones; (ii) a semiannual progress report by the end of the 6th month of \nthe TA, including outputs on the CSS review and the institutional capacity assessment; (iii) an \nannual progress report by the end of the 12th month, including outputs on the action plan for \nstrengthening CSS and the guidelines on environment assessment, and land acquisition and \nresettlement; (iv) a draft final report by the end of the 17th month, including training and \ncapacity-building outputs; and (v) a final report within 1 month after receiving the comments on \nthe draft final report from the government and ADB. The consultants will submit two copies of \neach report to ADB and four copies to the government. The TA team leader will coordinate TA \nactivities and consolidate TA outputs.  \n \n22.   TA activities will be closely monitored and feedback sought from the government and \nstakeholders  on  TA  performance.  The  draft  TA  outputs  will  be  discussed  or  shared  with \ngovernment  agencies,  development  partners,  and  other  stakeholders.  The  TA  will  widely \ndisseminate  information  for  public  awareness  and  consultation  at  various  stages  through \nworkshops, seminars, and meetings. A TA completion report will be prepared at the end of the \nTA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 to the Government \nof Solomon Islands to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for \nStrengthening Country Safeguard Systems in the Transport Sector, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  and  Data Sources and  Assumptions \na\nSummary  Indicators with Baselines   Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact  By December 2016:     Assumption \n       \nTransport projects  30% increase in transport  Monitoring reports from  The government \nimplemented in an  projects, including both  MID, MECCDM, and  implements the \nenvironmentally and  funded externally and by the  MLHS  action plan to \nsocially responsible  government, adopting the  strengthen CSS. \nmanner   improved environmental and   \nsocial safeguard systems  \n(2012 baseline: about 30%) \n \nOutcome  By September 2014:    Assumption \n       \nImproved CSS  100 staff of MID, MECCDM,  Reports of MID,  The government \nframework and  MLHS, and other agencies  MECCDM, and MLHS  approves the \nimplementation  trained on environmental    sector guidelines, \ncapacity on  and social safeguards    and MID, \nenvironmental and  (2012 baseline: about 20    MECCDM, \nsocial safeguards in the  staff)    MLHS, and other \ntransport sector       agencies \nTwo sector guidelines are    mandate training \navailable for environmental  Sector guidelines  on safeguards for \nassessment and land    their staff. \nacquisition and resettlement     \nfor transport projects     \n(2012 baseline: 0)     \n \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
