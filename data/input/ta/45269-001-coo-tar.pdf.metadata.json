INTRODUCTION \n1.  The focus of the capacity development technical assistance (TA) project is consistent \nwith the aims of Te Kaveinga Nui, the Cook Islands' National Sustainable Development Plan \n(NSDP), 2007\u20132010,1 and ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach 2010\u20132014.2 The TA follows on from policy \nadvisory TA to support public finance management and public sector performance review.3 It will \nimplement  priority  public  sector  reforms  recommended  by  the  functional  review  conducted \nunder the earlier TA and endorsed by the Government of the Cook Islands.  \n \n2.  A fact-finding mission for the TA4 visited the Cook Islands on 22\u201330 August 2011 and \nreached an understanding with the government and other stakeholders on the impact, outcome, \noutputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for \nconsulting services. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  There had been no review of the Cook Islands public service since the major public \nsector reforms in 1995\u20131996 that were driven by a financial crisis rooted in an expanding public \nsector, limited resource base, and accelerating debt burden. The reforms reduced the number \nof ministries by about one-third, and the number of civil servants from 3,200 in 1995 to 1,868 in \n1996. That effort and other reforms resulted in average gross domestic product (GDP) growth of \n6% per annum from 1999 to 2004. However, minimal infrastructure investment, the impact of \nseveral cyclones, high inflation, and the global economic crisis led to an economic contraction in \nthe latter part of the decade. The economy is gradually recovering with growth of 0.5% in 2010, \nestimated growth of 1.1% in FY2011, and expectations of higher growth over the medium term. \nThe government recognized that another public sector reform program will be essential for \nboosting  economic  management  to  maintain  growth.  This  will  go  hand  in  hand  with  the \ncommitment to the updated financial ratios: (i) tax revenue not to exceed 25% of GDP unless it \nis due to better compliance and efficiency; (ii) public sector wages and salaries not to exceed  \n44% of total revenue and to be reduced to 40% in the out years; (iii) debt servicing not to \nexceed 5% of total revenue; (iv) overall deficit not to exceed 2% of GDP; and (v) net debt not to \nexceed 35% of GDP. \n \n4.  The number of civil servants has averaged about 1,750 since the mid-2000s. Despite \nthis, the public service as a proportion of the workforce grew from 16% in 1996 to 18% in 2006. \nThe ratio of population per public sector employee decreased from 9.7 in 1996 to 7.4 in 2006 as \nthe population declined due to out-migration. Meanwhile, it was noted that the budget had \ntripled since the reforms with no corresponding improvement in the quality of service delivery. \nThe assessment of the public service was initiated by the previous government and endorsed \nby the current government when it assumed office in November 2010, signaling high-level \ncommitment to the reforms. While the earlier reforms were driven by a financial crisis, the \ncurrent ones are focused on strengthening leadership; stronger performance based on clear \noutput requirements; greater efficiency; empowerment of the outer islands; and public\u2013private \npartnerships.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Government of the Cook Islands. 2007. Te Kaveinga Nui \u2013 National Sustainable Development Plan, 2007\u20132010. \nRarotonga. A new NSDP (2011\u20132014) will be launched in early 2012. \n2  ADB. 2009. ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach 2010\u20132014. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the Cook Islands for the Public Finance Management and Public Sector \nReview. Manila (TA 7646-COO, approved in November 2010). \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 November 2011. \n ", "2  \n5.  The functional review of the public service raised a number of issues: (i) structures and \npriorities are not aligned with the NSDP; (ii) the quality of services is suboptimal; (iii) there is a \nlack  of  separation  in  policy,  regulation,  and  service  provision;  (iv)  business  plans  and \nperformance  management  systems  are  generally  of  poor  quality;  (v)  there  is  a  need  to \nstrengthen the leadership and performance management role of the Office of the Public Service \nCommission (OPSC); (vi) outer island mayors and councils feel disempowered by the current \nroles  and  structures;  (vii)  state-owned  enterprises  lack  accountability  and  show  poor \nperformance; (viii) complementary functions and agencies need to be grouped into sectors; and \n(ix) some functions are fragmented across more than one ministry.  \n \n6.  The review proposed the following actions: to (i) shift to a medium-term, outcome-\noriented  budgeting  framework;  (ii)  organize  and  empower  outer  islands'  governance; \n(iii) strengthen administration systems through shared non-core services; (iv) organize ministries \nand crown agencies into eight sectors; (v) strengthen public\u2013private partnerships; (vi) provide a \nmore cohesive approach to economic development; (vii) redefine constitutional agencies; and \n(viii) strengthen the OPSC. As regards the restructuring into eight sectors, the government has \nindicated a two-stage implementation, reflecting capacity constraints in the public service. The \ngovernment  has  articulated  its  reform  priorities  based  on  (i)  the  need  to  protect  people's \nlivelihoods; (ii) a clear identification of benefits from the change; (iii) a change process that is \nmeasured and managed (\u201csure and steadfast\u201d) with a defined communications strategy to \nensure engagement of all stakeholders; and (iv) an initial focus on changes that are easier to \nintroduce, leaving the more difficult changes for consideration later in the process. Based on \nthis,  the  structural  changes  in  selected  newly  defined  sectors  (to  be  confirmed  by  the \ngovernment by end December 2011) will be implemented in stage 1 with support from this TA, \nto be effective in FY2013. The process of reforming the other remaining sectors will begin under \nthis TA but be completed in stage 2, proposed to be supported by follow-on ADB capacity \ndevelopment TA in the country operations business plan pipeline for 2013 approval. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The expected impact of the TA will be sound economic management of the Cook Islands \neconomy to maintain a targeted annual economic growth rate of at least 3.5% over the medium \nterm. The expected TA outcome will be a more responsive and cost-effective scope, structure, \nand size of selected public service sectors, aligned with national priorities. The new structure of \nthe selected sectors will become effective on 1 July 2012, with necessary resources reflected in \nthe FY2013 national budget.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will support the government in implementing (i) the functional and organizational \nstructures of selected public service sectors to be confirmed by the government by the end of \nDecember 2011, (ii) changes to outer island administration, and (iii) an effective public service \npolicies manual. \n \n9.  Output  1:  Restructuring  of  the  Cook  Islands  public  service  (stage  1).  Before \neffecting changes to the existing sectors and line ministries, several actions are essential. The \ngovernment, at its highest level, has taken ownership of this process and will appoint a minister \nto oversee implementation along with a steering committee, supported by a project manager \nand the TA team. Necessary legislative amendments will be drafted for approval in line with \n ", "  3\nendorsed core functions and approved organizational structures. The heads and second-tier \nmanagers of the restructured ministries (corresponding to the selected sectors) will also be \nappointed and, along with the OPSC and the TA team, will develop the business plans complete \nwith  staff  requirements  by  function  and  grading  (including  job  descriptions),  logistics,  and \nfunding requirements, which also informs the budget process. The TA team will help develop \nstrategies  that  enable  appropriate  management  of  surplus  positions  identified  through  the \nrestructuring process. Once ministries are fully staffed, the TA will support them in preparing \ntheir service charters. Awareness programs and capacity development will be an ongoing part \nof the implementation.  \n \n10.  Output 2: Changes to the Cook Islands outer island administration. The review \nrecommended that responsibility for outer island administration be under the auspices of the \nlocal government division to be established in the Office of the Prime Minister. Once the director \nof local government is appointed, a rollout plan for outer island empowerment, including relevant \nmemorandums of understanding with the different island councils, will be finalized. Awareness \nprograms and capacity development will again be a crucial and ongoing part of implementation. \n \n11.  Output 3: Effective public service policies manual. The functional review team of the \nearlier  TA,  led  by  the  governance  analyst  and  counterpart  staff,  paved  the  way  for  the \npreparation of the public service policies manual. The OPSC will finalize the manual, including \nguidelines for issues likely to arise from implementing the new structures. The TA will continue \nto assist this process and support development of reporting lines to monitor effectiveness of the \nmanual. The TA will support development of a citizen's report card tied to service charters to \ngauge public feedback on service delivery. \n \n12.  There are always risks associated with public sector reforms. Such changes can be \npolitically sensitive and the 1995\u20131996 experience means that the public\u2019s confidence in the \nbenefit of such reforms is very low. More broadly, there is a risk that potential job losses will \nlead to more out-migration given the easy accessibility for Cook Islanders of New Zealand and \nAustralia. It is critical that the current reform momentum is maintained, hence there should be a \nseamless implementation process. In selecting the sectors for stage 1 implementation, the \ngovernment will focus on positive changes that are easier to introduce and will gain the public\u2019s \nconfidence. A good communications strategy and awareness program will also help clarify \nissues and promote the benefits while alleviating fears of change. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at the equivalent of $625,000. The government has \nrequested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, transport and other \nin-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The OPSC will be the executing and implementing agency for the TA. The government \nwill  appoint  a  minister  to  oversee  implementation  of  the  reforms  along  with  the  steering \ncommittee already established under the earlier TA.  \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 16 months from 1 January 2012 to 30 April 2013. The \nTA is expected to finance 16 person-months of intermittent international consulting inputs and \n ", "4  \n24 person-months of national consulting inputs. The consultants will work as a cohesive team to \ndeliver  the  tasks  as  outlined  in  the  terms  of  reference  in  Appendix  3.  The  international \nconsulting team will comprise a project management and public sector reform specialist, who \nwill be team leader (8 person-months); a human resource management and organizational \nchange specialist (4 person-months); and a legal review  specialist (4 person-months). The \nnational consulting team will consist of a local government reform advisor (12 person-months) \nand a public sector reform advisor (12 person-months). \n \n16.  The consultants will be selected and engaged on an individual basis and according to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Preliminary \ncost estimates are in Appendix 2. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nEquipment will be purchased in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as \namended from time to time) and will be turned over to the executing agency upon completion of \nTA activities. \n17.  The team leader will produce a concise inception report outlining the work program and \nmilestones for the duration of the TA, and a final report summarizing the achievements, issues, \nlessons learned, and next steps. Throughout the TA, the team leader will submit (by e-mail) \nbrief monthly progress reports summarizing TA activities, progress, issues, and constraints. \nTeam members will produce inputs (reports on their activities) for the team leader's progress \nand final reports. The team leader's final report will be submitted in draft form at least 5 weeks \nbefore the end of the assignment, and the final version within 2 weeks of receiving comments \nfrom the government and ADB. \n \n18.  Progress of the TA will be monitored on the basis of intended outcomes and outputs \ndescribed in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). ADB will assist the government \nin  sharing  all  reports  with  key  development  partners,  and  in  disseminating  them  through \nroundtable meetings, radio interviews, and the ADB website.  \n \nIV.
