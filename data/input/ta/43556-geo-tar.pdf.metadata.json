INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Georgia is aiming to improve the delivery of water supply and sanitation \n(WSS) services through effective implementation of legal, economic, and financial frameworks for \nlocal self-governance. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) interim operational strategy (2008\u2013\n2009)  for  Georgia 1  was  developed  in  line  with  the  government's  agenda,  and  identified \ndevelopment of the country's municipal infrastructure as a key contributor to sustainable economic \ngrowth, with the crosscutting themes of governance, regional cooperation, and environmental \nsustainability. Consequently, ADB's support to the WSS sector has grown since 2008 through the \nmunicipal services development project.2 \n \n2.  The government proposes to improve and expand WSS services across urban centers by \nleveraging donor and private sector funds, and has requested ADB to develop an urban WSS \nsector strategy to assist it with planning long-term investments. It has also requested ADB to \ndevelop a regulatory framework and establish urban WSS tariffs to improve service delivery and \nensure sustainability of WSS services. \n \n3.  ADB agreed with the government on the objectives and scope of the technical assistance \n(TA), the terms of reference for consultants, and the cost and implementation arrangements.3 The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Access  to  services.  Water  supply  is  largely  based  on  groundwater  sources,  and \nabstraction  levels  are  high.  Nonrevenue  water  is  estimated  at  75%  or  higher  due  to  ageing \ninfrastructure, with no replacement or rehabilitation investments made since the systems were \nconstructed. The systems were designed for high supply levels to consumers\u2014for example, Tbilisi \nsupplies water at 800 liters per capita per day\u2014with no emphasis on water conservation. Sewer \nsystems cover parts of large towns (>50,000 persons), but there is no sewage treatment. Large \nparts of the population depend on pit latrines or septic tanks. Sewage is discharged into water \nchannels and rivers, which affects downstream drinking water quality. Investments were prioritized \nand made based on the urgency of the requirement; consequently, the impact was not necessarily \ntangible  and  investment  sustainability  was  questionable.  This  also  has  health  implications, \nespecially for vulnerable groups such as children and women. \n \n5.  Poverty and gender analysis. Field assessments in the country's urban sector indicated \nthat the poor mostly live in areas without regular water supplies and sewage. They often suffer \nfrom  serious  water  supply  shortages,  poor  water  quality,  sewage  pollution,  and  poor  urban \nenvironmental sanitation. Poor hygiene and sanitation practices result in water borne illness and \nnegatively impact the health of women4 and girls, who are primarily responsible for household \nwater collection in these poor communities. The representation of women in management of water \nsupply and sanitation services is low, while the potential to make decisions in the sector is high. \nGender mainstreaming in the WSS sector is expected to enhance benefits to women through \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009. Interim Operational Strategy: Georgia, 2008-09. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2008. Municipal Services Development Project. Manila. \n  ADB. 2009. Municipal Services Development Project-Phase 2. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 December 2009. \n4  Sex-disaggregated data indicates that households headed by  women account for 40% of the country's urban \nhouseholds and are smaller than households headed by men. \n ", "2   \ntraining  and  awareness-raising  programs  focusing  on  drinking  water  safety,  water  and \nenvironmental sanitation and diseases, and hygiene and sanitation education. \n \n6.  Environmental  management.  Four  river  basins  (Alazani,  Inguri,  Kura  and  Rioni)  are \nseverely affected by direct sewage discharge from the towns. Lack of sewage treatment facilities, \nnonfunctional  sewage  treatment  plants,  and  dilapidated  sewer  systems  result  in  sewage \npercolation into the ground or direct discharge into surface water. Of particular importance is the \nsewage discharge into Kura River, which is an international waterway flowing into Azerbaijan from \nGeorgia. Environmental management of the river through improved wastewater management in \nthe riverside towns will specifically benefit downstream water abstraction and irrigation facilities. \n \n7.  Institutional  issues.  In  2009,  the  government  undertook  a  reform  path  to  correct \ninstitutional anomalies, and in June 2009, it consolidated 66 water companies in the country into \nthree regional water companies\u2014east, west, and Ajara (for the Autonomous Region). This decision \nwas based on the recommendations of a United States Agency for International Development-\nassisted TA to improve the sector's efficiency. In June 2009, the government also created the \nWater  Supply  Regional  Development  Agency  (WSRDA)  under  the  Ministry  of  Regional \nDevelopment and Infrastructure (MORDI) to manage sector reforms and oversee the operations of \nthe water companies. WSRDA is expected to cooperate closely with each regional governor's \noffice, local government units, and the Municipal Development Fund (MDF) to develop the WSS \nsector.  \n \n8.  Sustainable financing. Investments in the WSS sector started in 1996, with support from \nthe World Bank. Investments are largely donor financed and approximately $350 million has been \ninvested to date. Funds were channeled through the MDF with onlending to local governments, \nexcept  in  Batumi  where  the  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW  is  developing \ninfrastructure directly through the local government. Cost recovery on investments is low, and \nbilling to recover operational costs is lower than 50% in most towns. With the consolidation of \nwater companies, the assets created through MDF and accrued liabilities by local governments are \nbeing transferred from local governments to the regional water companies.  \n \n9.  External assistance. In addition to ADB, the World Bank, the United States Agency for \nInternational  Development,  the  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW, the  European \nBank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD),  the  Swedish  International  Development \nCooperation Agency, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation have supported the government's \ninitiative to improve water and sanitation in urban centers. Focused and large-scale investments in \nthe  sector  were  through:  (i)  the  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation,  EBRD,  and  the  Swedish \nInternational Development Cooperation Agency in the cities of Kutaisi, Borjomi, Kobuleti, and Poti; \nand (ii) the German development cooperation through KfW in Batumi. Support was primarily based \non requests from the government and focused on improving the local economy in the target cities. \nADB and World Bank support through the MDF covers the entire country and is focused on \nimproving  priority  infrastructure.  EBRD  will  assist  the  regional  water  companies  in  corporate \ndevelopment, financial and operational performance improvement, capital investment planning, \nand capacity development. This assistance is expected to substantially improve service delivery \nand the fiscal status of the water companies. The World Bank also is conducting discussions with \nthe government to develop a sanitation sector strategy for the rural sector and small towns. \n \n10.  Private sector participation. Tbilisi, Rustavi, Mskheta, and Gardabani water companies \nwere privatized in June 2008 and are managed by a holding company\u2014Georgia Water and Power \n ", "  3\nCompany (GWPC).5 GWPC's annual turnover is approximately GEL100 million ($62.5 million) with \n90% of its income being sourced from the WSS sector; GWPC spends 75% of its income and \ngenerates a profit. The company proposes to use donor funds to finance the rehabilitation of \nTbilisi's water supply system and the Gardabani sewage treatment plant (estimated to cost $90 \nmillion\u2013$150 million based on the extent of rehabilitation or reconstruction required). .  \n \n11.  Reform agenda. The government has articulated its reform agenda in its Water Supply and \nWastewater Sector Development Policy6. There is a clear emphasis on improving infrastructure \nand  service  quality;  cost  recovery,  financial  sustainability  of  regional  water  companies,  and \noperational efficiencies; demand management through reduced water losses; service access to the \npoor and vulnerable; a legal and regulatory framework; and sector management through modern \nmanagement systems\u2014management information systems and geographical information systems. \nWSRDA has commenced work on the above areas and is internally developing the consumer \ndatabase and management information systems to improve revenue and expenditure management. \nDeveloping an urban WSS sector strategy will ensure that reforms address institutional, financial \nand environmental sustainability of services, and are oriented to meet the Government's long-term \nobjective of improved WSS services across the country. \n \n12.  Regulation  of  WSS  services.  In  2009,  the  government  included  regulation  of  WSS \nservices  as  a  core  function  of  the  Georgia  National  Energy  and  Water  Supply  Regulatory \nCommission (GNEWSRC). The GNEWSRC will regulate sector performance and currently plans to \ndevelop a legal and regulatory framework, and a tariff fixation methodology for the sector. The \nWater Law, 1997 needs to be aligned to the Reform Agenda to achieve independent, autonomous, \naccountable, and transparent regulation of WSS services. Amendments to the law are required, \nincluding those for implementing guidelines that focus on economic, technical, and environmental \nregulations. Similarly, a tariff setting methodology was approved in 2008 but requires revisiting \ngiven the inability of water companies to adopt proposed methods, which do not provide for a \nprogressive method in transiting from O&M cost recovery to full cost recovery.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n13.  The  policy  and  advisory  TA  will  support  the  government's  ongoing  reform  agenda  by \ndeveloping: (i) the urban WSS sector strategy and road map, including a social and gender \ndevelopment strategy; and (ii) the WSS tariff and regulatory framework. The outputs of the TA will \nalso  facilitate  implementation  of  investment  programs  in  the  urban  WSS  sector,  including  a \nproposed ADB-financed multitranche financing facility investment program (MFF-IP).7 The TA will \nprovide  direction  to  the  government  in  developing  a  strategic  vision  for  the  sector  and \nimplementing its reform agenda. While developing the urban WSS sector strategy and road map, \n                                                 \n5  By 2018, GWPC will (i) reduce current average 800 liters per capita per day water supply to normative levels and \nensure all households within its jurisdiction are supplied with uninterrupted, potable, and pressurized water; (ii) ensure \nno sewage is discharged into Kura River from Tbilisi and the peri-urban area, and all sewage is treated and safely \ndischarged from the Gardabani sewage treatment plant; and (iii) improve collection efficiencies from the current 85% \nand disconnect defaulters. \n6  Government of Georgia. 2009. Water Supply and Wastewater Sector Development Policy. Tbilisi (October draft). \n7  The MFF-IP will specifically address (i) basic urban infrastructure and services management in the provincial capitals \nand secondary towns; (ii) institutional issues associated with basic urban services; (iii) capacity development of the \nexecuting agency (MORDI), the WSRDA, and the regional water companies' staff to deliver services efficiently; and (iv) \nimproved financial management of institutions to facilitate efficient service delivery. Trunk infrastructure traversing the \ntowns/cities will provide poor communities with access to basic services\u2014potable water and safe sanitation. By \ndeveloping institutionally and financially sustainable services, the MFF-IP will introduce good governance features that \nwill have a trickle-down effect and support pro-poor growth. \n ", "4   \nthe government will develop an investment plan and create a business climate for donors and \ncofinanciers to invest in the sector. Establishing the WSS tariff and regulatory framework will \nprovide tools for regulating WSS services, and ensure investment sustainability in the long term. \n \n14.  The TA will also provide inputs to the MFF-IP along with a parallel project preparatory TA.8 \nAnalysis  and  outputs  of  the  TA  will  form  key  inputs\u2014the  sector  strategy,  social  and  gender \nanalysis,  financial  management  assessment  of  the  implementing  agencies  (WSRDA9 and  the \nregional water companies)\u2014for structuring the MFF-IP. Results of the willingness-to-pay survey \nand tariff structuring will correlate with planned investments under the MFF-IP and will confirm the \neconomic feasibility of proposed investments. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The  impact  of  the  TA  is  improved  WSS  services  in  Georgia's  provincial  capitals  and \nsecondary towns. The outcome of the TA is improved governance and efficiently regulated WSS \nservices in Georgia's urban centers. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The TA will result in the following outputs: \n \n(i)  Output  1:  Urban  WSS  sector  strategy  and  road  map. The TA will help the \ngovernment  develop  an  urban  WSS  sector  strategy,  a  road  map  for  sector \ninvestments, and policy and institutional reforms, and thus help create a business \nclimate for donor and private sector investments. The road map will also form the \nbasis for ADB's MFF-IP. The TA will assess institutional, financial and procurement \nrisks  associated  with  transactions  in  the  urban  WSS  sector,  and  develop  a \nmanagement plan to mitigate the risks. \n \n(ii)  Output 2: Urban social and gender development strategy. The TA will help the \ngovernment develop a poverty reduction and social strategy for the urban sector. \nThe  assistance  will  also  result  in  a  gender  action  plan  to  ensure  gender \ndevelopment  and  participation  in  improving  WSS  services  in  Georgia's  urban \ncenters. \n \n(iii)  Output 3: Urban WSS tariffs. The TA will conduct socioeconomic and willingness-\nto-pay surveys for developing urban WSS tariffs. Tariff setting will draw from ADB's \nEconomic  and  Research  Department  Technical  Note  Series  No.  23  on  Good \nPractices for Estimating Reliable Willingness-to-Pay Values in the Water Supply and \nSanitation Sector, Economic and Research Department Technical Note Series No. \n24 on Utility Tariff Setting for Economic Efficiency and Financial Sustainability\u2014A \nReview, and international best practices. Pro-poor tariffs will also be established. \nThe framework and tariffs will be finalized after consulting relevant stakeholders, \nincluding GNEWSRC, WSRDA, and regional water companies. \n \n(iv)  Output 4: Urban WSS regulatory framework. The TA will develop an urban WSS \nregulatory framework for GNEWSRC and suggest amendments to the Water Law, \n1997.  The  regulatory  framework  will  be  based  on  international  best  practices, \n                                                 \n8  The project preparatory TA was approved on 5 January 2010. \n9  WSRDA is the executing agency for the project preparatory TA. \n ", "  5\nespecially those in ADB developing member countries, and will define database \nmanagement systems to manage information on services; indicators that reflect \noutput,  processes,  productivity,  and  efficiency;  and  the  institutional  set-up  for \nregulation of WSS services. \n \n17.  Outputs 1 and 2 will provide the government with a policy and strategic focus for developing \nits urban centers and ensuring social development in its provincial capitals and secondary cities. \nOutputs  3  and  4  will  provide  the  regulatory  body  with  guidelines  to  regulate  the  economic, \ntechnical, and environmental aspects of WSS services in the country's urban centers.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $884,500 equivalent.  ADB will finance $862,500 \nequivalent  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF\u2013IV)  and  the \ngovernment will finance the remaining $22,000 equivalent.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  For the policy and advisory TA, MORDI through the WSRDA will be the executing agency \nresponsible for overseeing the delivery of outputs 1 and 2, while GNEWSRC will be the executing \nagency responsible for outputs 3 and 4. A financial management assessment of MORDI, WSRDA \nand regional water companies will be undertaken by the financial management specialist in the TA \nteam. A procurement assessment of MORDI, WSRDA and regional water companies will be \nundertaken  by  ADB's  project  processing  team.  A  TA  steering  committee  comprising \nrepresentatives of MORDI, WSRDA and GNEWSRC will coordinate outputs of the policy and \nadvisory TA and the project preparatory TA. \n \n20.  A  firm  will  be  engaged  to  develop  the  sector  strategy,  road  map,  social  and  gender \ndevelopment strategy, WSS tariffs, and legal and regulatory framework. The firm will be selected \nthrough  a  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  using  simplified  technical  proposals  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \n21.

Overview \n1.  Multitranche financing facility loan and investment program. About $2 billion is required \nto improve the water supply and sanitation (WSS) services in Georgia's cities and towns (excluding \nTbilisi and suburban towns). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) proposes to provide a loan for \n$500 million through its multitranche financing facility to improve the health of the resident population \nin  Georgia's  provincial  capitals  and  secondary  towns,  through  improved  water  and  sanitation \nservices. This support will complement ongoing donor efforts to improve the country's urban WSS \nservices. Through a separate project preparatory technical assistance (TA), ADB will develop a \nmultitranche  financing  facility  investment  program  (MFF-IP).  The  MFF-IP  will  evolve  from  the \ngovernment's vision for the sector based on its strategic road map, policy framework for the sector \nand reform implementation plan, and business climate for increased investments from donors. The \npolicy and advisory TA consultants will work closely with the project preparatory TA consultants in \ndeveloping the MFF-IP and helping the government implement its reform agenda. \n \nB.  Scope of Work \n2.  The policy and advisory TA will facilitate the government's reform agenda by: (i) developing \nthe urban WSS sector strategy and road map, and a social and gender development strategy; and (ii) \ndeveloping  the  WSS  tariff  and  regulatory  framework,  and  assisting  the  government  in  making \ncorresponding amendments to the Water Law, 1997. \n \n  1.  Output 1: Urban WSS Sector Strategy and Road Map \n \n3.  Urban WSS sector strategy. Developing the sector strategy will include but not be limited to: \n(i) a review of existing studies, analyses, and policy frameworks relating to Georgia's urban sector; (ii) \nan  analysis  of  existing  water  and  sanitation  conditions  in  urban  centers  through  a  database \nassessment and site visits; (iii) an analysis of the competitive advantages and weaknesses and \neconomic potential of each town, and an outline of the indicative economic development strategies \nfor each town; (iv) a review of existing legal, regulatory, and planning frameworks for water and \nsewerage services, including associated legislation in various ministries including the Ministry of \nEnvironment and Natural Resources, Ministry of Economic Development, and Ministry of Labor, \nHealth and Social Affairs; (v) a review of the investment plans of the regional water companies; (vi) a \nreview  of  operational  plans  of  regional  water  companies,  including  technical  skills  required  for \nsystem maintenance; (vii) a review of institutional and financial relationships between the Ministry of \nRegional  Development  and  Infrastructure,  WSRDA,  the  Municipal  Development  Fund,  local \ngovernments,  and  regional  water  companies;  (viii)  an  examination  of  social  dimensions, \nenvironmental considerations, safeguards, and governance issues in sector management; and (ix) \nbased on the above assessment, the development of a strategic vision for the urban WSS sector \nthat would suggest improvements to the existing Water and Wastewater Sector Development Policy \nFramework.  \n \n4.
