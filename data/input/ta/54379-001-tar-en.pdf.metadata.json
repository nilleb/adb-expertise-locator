INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The regional knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support capacity \ndevelopment of developing member countries (DMCs) in South Asia by consolidating and further \nstrengthening the institutional approach for delivering capacity building programs in the South \nAsia Department (SARD) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The TA will upgrade and digitize \ncapacity building programs on ADB procedures, including financial management, procurement \nand  contract  management,  disbursement,  gender,  safeguards,  and  project  monitoring  and \nreporting for virtual delivery; and develop detailed training programs tailored to DMC demand and \nemerging issues and aligned with best practices in course design and delivery.1 \n \n2.  The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priority 6 on strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity, particularly on strengthening government capacity to plan, \ndesign, finance, and implement ADB projects; operational priority 1 on addressing remaining \npoverty and reducing inequalities; and operational priority 2 on accelerating progress in gender \nequality,2 as strengthened DMC capacity to implement ADB-funded projects would help achieve \ndevelopment outcomes in government- and ADB-funded projects. The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s \ncountry programs for SARD DMCs, as they put a premium on strengthening the performance of \nADB-financed projects to achieve development outcomes. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Alignment with the Asian Development Bank strategy. The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030, including its focus on strengthening the capacity of executing and implementing \nagencies  to  implement  ADB-financed  projects.  In  2010,  SARD  introduced  the  Capacity \nDevelopment Resource Center (CDRC) in the India Resident Mission to provide structured and \nsystematic development of government agencies' capacity to implement ADB-funded projects. \nCDRC has played a significant role in strengthening portfolio performance through training in ADB \nprocedures, project implementation, and thematic areas. Since CDRC\u2019s introduction, 10,600 \nexecuting and implementing agency staff have received training in ADB procedures and thematic \nareas, contributing to improved portfolio performance. The India Resident Mission\u2019s capacity \ndevelopment model was successfully replicated in the Nepal Resident Mission starting in 2015, \nand SARD\u2019s other resident missions have been delivering training in their DMCs. \n \n4.  Upgrading the quality of capacity building. The SARD portfolio\u2019s rapid growth has led \nto many executing and implementing agencies, in new sectors and remote areas, implementing \nADB-financed projects. Emerging needs, the increasing complexity and multisector approaches \nof ADB projects, and the evolving development landscape require ADB to scale up and upgrade \ncapacity development initiatives. There is a need to (i) develop a common framework for capacity \ndevelopment in SARD DMCs, (ii) mainstream the CDRC model to other SARD resident missions, \nand (iii) upgrade CDRC capacity to deliver courses. In early 2020, SARD launched the CDRC \nnetwork, comprising SARD resident mission staff, to develop the common framework that will help \ncreate economies of scale, improve efficiency, and ensure consistency of capacity development \nactivities.  The  framework  aims  to  standardize  content  and  delivery,  provide  guidance  and \ntechnology support to resident missions, and foster collaboration. \n \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 November 2020. \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n ", "2 \n5.  SARD resident missions deliver training using their own training materials, which are of \nvarying quality. Updating materials in each SARD resident mission because of changes in ADB \npolicies and procedures often results in duplication of efforts. There is a need to develop a \nstandard set of training materials applicable to all resident missions, while recognizing the unique \ncontext of each SARD DMC and tailoring these courses to local contexts. Developing and \nstrengthening executing and implementing agency staff capacity to implement ADB-financed \nprojects requires not only increasing their understanding of ADB policies and procedures but also \ndeveloping specific skills that would lead to strong portfolio performance. Therefore, CDRC needs \nto develop modular, competency-based, and interactive training courses for DMCs. Competency-\nbased training requires analyzing the job tasks that executing and implementing agencies are \nexpected to perform in procurement, financial management, and other related areas. The task \nanalysis results will help provide a solid foundation for upgrading the capacity building programs. \n \n6.  Review of CDRC courses in May 2020 recommended the following improvements:3 (i) \nimprove audience targeting; (ii) implement competency-based training, focusing on expected \ncompetencies by conducting a task analysis to identify required knowledge, skills, and attitudes; \n(iii) translate overall course goals into more specific learning outcomes; (iv) classify CDRC \ncourses according to complexity and prepare guidelines for developing a learning road map for \nexecuting agencies; (v) use a varied approach to content delivery to engage participants actively \nand make courses more practical and applied; (vi) make the courses accessible by putting them \nonline; (vii) improve course module structure and relevance to executing and implementing \nagencies; and (viii) improve learning transfer and retention. In addition, the review highlighted the \nneed to create a support network for executing and implementing agencies to enhance their \nlearning, measure the impact of training on portfolio performance, offer more clinic-type capacity \nbuilding,4 and develop and launch courses to meet the emerging needs of  executing and \nimplementing agencies. \n \n7.  Converting training to digital. In light of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, \nmost capacity building programs for SARD DMCs have shifted to virtual training, which has given \nthe impetus to harness the power of technology. To this end, the TA will (i) convert core CDRC \ncourses into virtual training, (ii) train resource persons and facilitators in designing and facilitating \nvirtual training and interactive delivery, (iii) develop detailed guidelines for instructional design and \ndelivery, (iv) assess technology infrastructure availability at executing and implementing agencies \nand propose hardware and connectivity solutions for those in remote locations, (v) enhance online \nregistration and nomination systems, (vi) assess options for web-based clinics for executing and \nimplementing agencies, and (vii) develop an online repository of frequently asked questions. \n \n8.  Strengthening the sustainability of capacity development. Sustainable Development \nGoal 17.9 focuses on enhancing \u201cinternational support for implementing effective and targeted \ncapacity-building in developing countries,\u201d5 including cooperation among DMCs. Therefore, DMC \ncapacity needs to be systematically strengthened to design and implement development projects. \nAn integrated approach that leads to an incrementally institutionalized framework is needed to \nensure sustainability of the DMC capacity building. To maximize resources and build local \ncapacity, CDRC focuses on a strategy of engaging national training organizations to co-deliver \ncapacity building under CDRC with ADB staff. \n \n \n3  The review was undertaken under ADB. India: Capacity Building for Project Design, Implementation and Evaluation. \n4  Clinics refer to targeted project group work where trainers and participant teams work together on advanced topics \nrelated to project design and implementation. \n5  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Goal 17. \n ", "3 \n9.  The India Resident Mission has leveraged partnerships with national training institutes to \nsupport various aspects of training, and the Nepal Resident Mission has partnered with the Nepal \nAdministrative  Staff  College  to  co-deliver  training.  For  enhanced  sustainability,  training \npartnerships may need to be maximized beyond providing logistical support to include training \nadministration, new course development, training delivery, and training assessment. Therefore, \nthe TA will support efforts to institutionalize capacity building by identifying successful models \nfrom international financing institutions for engaging national training institutes in DMC capacity \nbuilding, identifying ways of cost sharing between ADB and national training institutes, and linking \nCDRC training to government civil servant certification systems.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: operational effectiveness of ADB projects in \nSouth Asia enhanced. The TA will have the following outcome: capacity of executing and \nimplementing agencies to design and implement ADB-financed projects in South Asia increased.6 \nThe outcome indicator of 1,000 executing and implementing agency staff under ADB-financed \nprojects reporting improved knowledge and skills in ADB procedures by 2023 directly measures \nthe expected outcome. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  The TA aims to consolidate and further strengthen the institutional approach for delivering \ncapacity  development  programs.  As  part  of  the  CDRC  common  framework,  the  TA  will \nprogressively introduce materials and instruments, including developing modular competency-\nbased tailored training to executing and implementing agencies with different capacity and \nfostering knowledge sharing among DMCs and cross-learning on flagship investment projects \nand good practices. The TA outputs will support strengthening instructional design and delivery \nwhere training materials and activities will be elaborated and revised for interactivity, meaningfully \nsequenced, and enriched by smart tutorial components and quality assurance mechanisms, \nincluding pre- and post-training support. \n \n12.  Output 1: Capacity building programs upgraded. Output 1 will support the following: \n \n(i)  The TA will engage experienced instructional designers and e-learning experts to \nconvert at least five CDRC courses to virtual training using videos, online polls and \nquizzes, interactive group work, and an online repository of learning materials. The \ncourses will be converted in coordination with ADB departments, such as the \nController\u2019s Department; the Procurement, Portfolio, and Financial Management \nDepartment; and the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department; \nand tailored to local contexts in coordination with SARD resident missions. CDRC \ndigital  content  will  be  uploaded  and  accessible  by  external  users,  such  as \nexecuting and implementing agencies. In addition, frequently asked questions for \nkey content areas will be developed and shared through an online repository. \n \n(ii)  At least one CDRC course will be redesigned as a modular, competency-based \ntraining course with job task analysis. The TA will support developing a standard \ntraining  approach  and  format  (a  training  package  consisting  of  a  syllabus, \n \n6  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \npresentation slides, case studies, and delivery mechanisms), aligned with the \nprinciples and best practices of adult learning, in addition to a pilot executing and \nimplementing agency capacity rating approach for the redesigned CDRC course. \n \n(iii)  At least 10 capacity building events, including peer learning and regional learning \nevents using upgraded materials, will be conducted. The TA will provide training \nfor resource persons and facilitators in participatory techniques and interactive \nvirtual delivery. \n \n13.  Output 2: Digital solutions developed. Output 2 will support (i) updating an online \ncourse registration and nomination system, (ii) assessing the technology infrastructure of remotely \nlocated  executing  and  implementing  agencies  and  recommending  hardware  and  software \nsolutions for connectivity issues, (iii) developing an online searchable repository of frequently \nasked questions, and (iv) developing options for web-based clinic sessions for executing and \nimplementing agencies. \n \n14.  Output 3: Sustainability of capacity building developed. The TA will develop proposals \nto engage accredited national training institutions to deliver training in partnership with ADB \nresident mission staff. This output will involve identifying (i) successful models for engaging \nnational training institutes in multilateral development bank capacity building, (ii) ways of cost \nsharing between ADB and national training institutes, and (iii) successful multilateral development \nbank projects that support capacity building of DMC governments\u2019 civil servants and link them to \ngovernments\u2019 own certification systems. \n \n15.  Knowledge generated by the TA will include practice guides, frequently asked questions \nfor executing and implementing agencies, DMC knowledge sharing events, and digitized courses \nthat will be available to executing and implementing agencies even after the training events. \nStrengthening DMC capacity for implementing ADB-financed projects requires going beyond \nclassroom training and increasing support for executing and implementing agency staff after \ntraining events to build their confidence in applying what they have learned. The TA will develop \nproposals for web-based clinics and coaching for executing and implementing agencies and will \norganize knowledge exchange and cross-learning activities, such as peer learning. \n \n16.  CDRC will adopt an integrated approach to capacity building. The TA aims to make the \nCDRC courses, including those offered by other ADB departments, part of a learning journey \nrather than a one-time event. This requires enhanced coordination with ADB stakeholders to \nensure that the capacity building initiatives build on each other. ADB\u2019s value addition includes \nassessing digital solutions such as web-based clinics and evaluating options for enhancing the \nsustainability of DMC capacity building initiatives by linking CDRC training to government civil \nservant certification systems. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $300,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will administer the TA. SARD will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; \norganize workshops; and provide staff to act as resource persons in the workshops. \n ", "5 \n \n19.
