INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to  provide policy and institutional support for the social insurance \nadministration (SIA) system during the 2003 Country Programming Mission. The Fact-Finding \nMission thus visited Beijing on 11- 15 August 2003  and reached an understanding with the \nGovernment on the objectives, scope, cost, financing, and implementation arrangements for the \ntechnical assistance (TA).1 The TA logical framework is in Appendix 1.  The Government has \nassigned  high  priority  to  social  security  reform  due  to  population  aging,  poor  financial \nperformance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and severe financial and management stress \nresulting from the poor design of the old social security system. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  An important milestone in social security reform was the promulgation of Document 26 in \n1997 by the State Council, laying the conceptual framework for a multipillared pension system to \nreplace the pay-as-you-go scheme.2 The implicit pension debt is large and needs to be financed \nas  part  of  the  reform  program.3  Due  to  the  weak  administrative  structure  and  regulatory \nframework,  many  provinces  had  difficulty  in  collection,  coverage,  pooling,  and  funding  of \nindividual pension accounts. Funds were diverted from individual accounts to pay recurrent \npension obligations. The pension system is still de facto pay as you go, which undermines public \nconfidence and reduces incentives to contribute to the pension fund. Recognizing the serious \nrisk brought by unfunded individual accounts, the State Council Task Force in December 2000 \nchose Liaoning Province to pilot-test the new approach aimed at fully funding individual accounts \nand reducing the size of implicit pension debt. At the same time, the National Social Security \nFund (NSSF) was established as a trust fund, to be administered by the National Council for the \nSocial Security Fund, to manage funds raised by the central Government to settle contingent \nliabilities of the social security system.4 \n \n3.  The  pilot  project  started  on  1  July  2001.  Throughout  the  pilot-test,  the  Liaoning \ngovernment encountered a number of challenging issues. Long-term actuarial cost analysis for \nthe pooling system and individual accounts was lacking, and detailed statistics of active and \nretired participants in each city were often not available. The fund for basic pensions was often \nused  to  cover  non-pension  expenditures,  including  unemployment  insurance,  severance \npayments, compensation for employees in bankrupt companies, and social subsidies to disabled \nworkers. It took an average of 30 days or more from the time of collection to the time of deposit \nin an interest-bearing individual account for the benefit of participants. Most processes involve \nmanual steps that need to be streamlined and automated. The most pressing issue is the current \ndeficit for all 14 cities in Liaoning.5 As yet, there is no provincial pooling of basic pensions in \nLiaoning. It is widely believed that the Liaoning pilot was actuarially unsound and unsustainable. \nHowever, because of the poor quality of available data, the quality of actuarial projections is poor \nand cannot support prudent policymaking. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in 4 March 2003. \n2  The pillars are social pooling with individual accounts, enterprise-sponsored schemes, and individual market-based \ninsurance. This structure was also adopted for health insurance. \n3  Implicit pension debt\u2014estimated to be 50\u2013150% of gross domestic product (GDP)\u2014is the total amount of pension \nobligations that the Government needs to cover to make the pension system actuarially sound. \n4  Funding sources for NSSF include budget allocation, proceeds earned from divesting state shares in SOEs, state \nlottery, and issuance of long-term government bonds. \n5  CNY6.7 billion in 2001. The deficit expressed as a percentage of pension payments ranges from 16.5% for Dalian \nCity to 60.8% for Anshan City. \n ", "2    \n4.  One reason for the less-than-satisfactory result of the pilot program is that Liaoning has a \ndecentralized  SIA  covering  14  cities,  7.5  million  employees,  and  2.8  million  retirees.  The \nLiaoning Social Security Department has overall responsibility for policymaking and overseeing \noperations of local SIAs. They mirror the city and district government organization, performing \nadministrative activities:  \n \n(i)  SIA operational processes vary widely and procedures have no formal procedural \ndocumentation  and  no  established  basic  performance  criteria.  Facilities  and \nstaffing  adequacies  vary  depending  on  city  or  district  economic  conditions. \nInterrelationships between provincial and local SIAs do not facilitate collection \nand/or retrieval of necessary data.  \n \n(ii)  Different collection compliance techniques are used without proper authority or \nstandardization. The supervisory committee has yet to begin its work. \n \n(iii)  SIAs have no standardized job descriptions or qualification requirements. Certain \nkey positions remain unfilled largely because of low pay. Standardized training \nand development programs are lacking, and staff training is mostly ad hoc.  \n \n(iv)  Different  cities  have  different  computers  and  have  developed  different \nmanagement information systems. A new provincial system has been developed, \nbut conversion of data is not automated. Significant work remains to be done to \nintegrate information from the pension system with that from the labor, finance, \ntaxation,  civil  affairs,  and  statistical  bureaus  of  the  provincial  government  to \nensure efficient service and minimize leakage. \n \n5.   The  PRC  SIA  system  operates  pension  schemes  for  140  million  people,  medical \ninsurance schemes for 94 million, unemployment insurance schemes for about 100 million, and \nmaternity and working injury insurance for about 40 million each. The system comprises 6,469 \nagencies and close to 100,000 staff, including 7,000 handling rural social security. Although over \n70% of SIA staff have 2\u20134-year college degrees, they are generally unqualified for social security \nwork. Organizationally, SIAs are service providers of the social security system while the Ministry \nof  Labor  and  Social  Security  (MOLSS)  and  local  labor  bureaus  are  policymakers  and \nsupervisors. SIAs are fully budget supported by different government levels, but their allocations \nare often insufficient and sometimes only cover basic salaries. \n \n6.  MOLSS  maintains  a  central  government  agency,  the  National  Social  Insurance \nAdministration (NSIA).6 It has 13 divisions and a staff of 75. Its mandate is to provide policy and \noperational  guidance  to  manage  and  administer  the  social  security  system  nationwide. \nSpecifically, NSIA (i) supervises the SIA system;7 (ii) provides policy guidance to local SIAs on \noperational issues such as registration; reconciliation of records, management of individual \naccounts, and inheritance of benefits; (iii) allocates fiscal transfers among provinces based on \ncertain criteria;8 and (iv) conducts prequalification tests for senior-level management personnel of \nSIAs. NSIA has found that  reallocation of social security funds across provinces has been \ndifficult where SIAs are decentralized, such as Liaoning, which lacks standardized operational \nprocedures, performance criteria, and connectivity and unification of the information network; \ninstitutional capabilities; and human resources. \n                                                 \n6  NSIA is fully funded by the government budget but is not part of government structure, and its employees are not \ncivil servants. \n7  NSIA does not audit local SIAs as SIA audits are to be done by the auditor office of the respective levels of local \ngovernment.   \n8  The Ministry of Finance is also part of the decision-making process. ", "      3 \n \n7.  Of 31 PRC provinces and municipalities, only 2 provinces (Shaanxi and Jilin) and 2 \nmunicipalities (Shanghai and Tianjin)9 have centralized SIAs. Most provinces have had difficulty \nintroducing a centralized SIA at the provincial level because of resistance of local governments, \nand  administrative  difficulties  brought  about  by  the  decentralized  government  structure, \nspecifically pertaining to local finance departments and taxation bureaus. Centralization of SIAs \nhas advantages but some issues must also be addressed: responsibilities at various levels of \ngovernment, computer and information system integrity, and security in transferring information \nbetween different levels of governments. \n \n8.  Before 1999 the situation in Shaanxi was the same as in other provinces when local SIAs \nwere  associated  with  each  level  of  government,  and  provincial  governments  had  difficulty \nimplementing reform policies as well as reallocating social security funds between localities. The \nShaanxi provincial government recognized that SIAs had to be centralized to ensure consistent \npolicy  implementation  and  social  security  fund  management.  In  1998  the  budget  and \nadministration of municipal and county SIAs were consolidated at the provincial level so that \nlocal SIAs now represent the provincial SIA, with standardized designations.10 The salary of its \n1,700 staff and other benefits are provided from the provincial budget. The provincial SIA bureau \nis the policymaking body, and the municipal and city SIAs are the operational agencies. \n \n9.  In Shanghai, operational efficiency improved after 19 district SIAs were consolidated into \na municipal system. Now only one full-time staff, rather than staff in 19 separate SIAs, is needed \nto handle the integrated information system. Financial operations now need only 50 staff (down \nfrom 98), accelerating fund flows and strengthening financial control. Social security collections \nper staff of the Shanghai SIA increased from CNY26 million in 2000 to CNY32 million in 2001 \nand CNY37 million in 2002. The Shanghai SIA has also conducted systematic and targeted \ntraining for its 1,100 staff. \n \n10.  ADB has been a key partner of the Government since the launch of social security \nreforms through directly targeted policy and operational assistance11 to build an enabling policy \nand regulatory environment.12 \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The purpose of the TA is to strengthen institutional capabilities of the SIA system to \naccelerate social security reform. The TA will help improve operational efficiency of social \nsecurity services by adopting standardized operational procedures with well-defined performance \ncriteria, support human resource development through effective training programs and training \nmaterials, and recommend policy choices and steps leading toward the consolidation of SIAs. \n \n                                                 \n9  Municipalities directly under the central Government include Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing. \n10 The SIA bureau in the provinces, SIA division in municipalities, and SIA center in the counties. \n11 ADB. 1998.

The key activities of the TA will include the following:  \n \n(i)  Standardize  SIA  operational  procedures  for  all  aspects  of  social  insurance \nservices, covering (a) the use of performance contracts, (b) establishment of \nservice standards, (c)  details of the reporting system, (d) common formats for \ninformation  exchange,  and  (e)  computer  networking  to  improve  performance \nmanagement.  \n \n(ii)  Conduct surveys and policy research based on the experience of Shaanxi and \nShanghai in  consolidating SIA management at the provincial level; and  identify \nother provinces likely to succeed, based on their demographics and level of \nexisting  facilities  and  staff  adequacies.  Assess  the  feasibility  of  further \nconsolidation of the SIA system at the central government level. Issues include \nsequencing of the consolidation process, potential policy impacts on other parts of \nthe government structure, human resource and budgetary allocations, feasibility of \nimposing service fees as main or supplementary budget sources, and private \nsector investments to reduce government ownership in SIAs. \n \n(iii)  Assess training needs and establish systematic professional training and human \nresource development programs covering areas such as (a) curriculum design; (b) \ndrafting of specialized training materials; (c) an automatic test platform as part of \nthe SIA staff prequalification, and automatic database for test questions; and (d) \nrecommendations leading to the establishment of a training center. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1 million equivalent, including foreign \nexchange cost of $385,000 and local currency cost of $615,000 equivalent. ADB will provide \n$700,000 to finance the entire foreign exchange cost of $385,000 and a portion of the local \ncurrency cost equivalent to $315,000. The TA  will be financed on a grant basis from the ADB-\nfunded  TA  Program.  The  Government  will  contribute  $300,000  in  kind  for  office  space, \ncounterpart staff, transportation, and other services. Details of the cost estimates for three \ncomponents and the total are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  NSIA will be the Executing Agency. MOLSS will provide policy and implementing support. \nAn interagency working group will be established, under the leadership of the director general of \nNSIA, to work as the consultants\u2019 counterpart. NSIA and MOLSS will provide office space, \ncounterpart  staff,  transportation,  and  other  services  to  the  consultants  and  will  arrange \nappointments for the consultants with relevant agencies and organizations.  \n \n15.  The  TA  will  engage  three  international  consultants  for  a  total  of  6  person-months, \nincluding one team leader and social security administration specialist (3 person-months),  one \nsocial  security  training  specialist  (2  person-months),  and    one  social  security  operations \nspecialist (1 person-month). The three domestic consultants (total of 14 person-months) will \ncover the same set of expertise as the international consultants. More international and domestic \nspecialists will be engaged to cover specific technical areas such as medical insurance service \nstandards etc., and will be identified during TA implementation as need arises. The terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The Project will be tendered to an international ", "      5 \nfirm  based  on  a  simplified  technical  proposal,  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod. The consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants  and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of \ndomestic consultants. TA equipment will be provided in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. \n \n16.  The consultants will submit in English and Chinese (i) inception reports 2 weeks after \nservices start, (ii) interim progress reports at appropriate stages of TA implementation, (iii) draft \nfinal  reports  before  the  conclusion  of  the  contract,  and  (iv)  final  reports  2  weeks  after \nincorporating comments of EA and ADB. The TA will start in March 2004 and be completed in \nSeptember 2004. Domestic training seminars will be held intermittently under the new training \ncurriculum and using new materials. Overseas training will be selectively conducted in countries \nwith  a  consolidated  SIA  system  and  advanced  operational  and  management  mechanisms. \nWorkshops will be organized near the end of the implementation period to invite comments from \ninternational and domestic experts in the field and to disseminate the report\u2019s findings.  \n \n \nIV.
