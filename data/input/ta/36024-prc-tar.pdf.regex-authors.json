INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)\u2014during  the  2005  country  programming  mission\u2014for  technical \nassistance (TA) to establish the National Fund for Development of Credit Guarantees for Private \nEnterprises  (NCG).  A  fact-finding  mission  visited  Beijing  8\u201315  July  2005  and  reached  an \nunderstanding with the Government on the impact, outcome, cost, financing arrangements, \nterms of reference, and implementation arrangements for the TA.1 The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Over the past 15 years, the PRC\u2019s gross domestic product has grown by more than 8% \nper year. The private sector has been growing faster than state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and \nis contributing an increasing share to economic growth and job creation.2 The Government has \nmade commendable efforts to remove constraints on private-sector development, including \n(i) amending the constitution to provide a legal foundation for the private sector and protect legal \nproperty rights; (ii) diversifying ownership of SOEs and encouraging mergers and acquisitions; \nand (iii) promoting equal treatment for investment, financing, taxation, land use, and foreign \ntrade.  The  State  Council  Document  No.  33 specifically  removed  entry  barriers  for  private \nenterprises  to  operate  in  previously  state  or  SOE-controlled  sectors\u2014such  as  finance, \ninsurance, energy, urban development, environment protection, education, and healthcare. The \nsame Document also enhanced government support for financial services to private enterprises. \n3.  Despite the rapidly growing importance of private enterprises in the PRC, most of them \nhave had difficulty accessing financial services. Private enterprises are often perceived by \nbanks as less creditworthy, mainly because of lack of business track records and quality assets \nfor collateral. Unlike SOEs that enjoy effective government support, most private enterprises do \nnot have access to financing support from international organizations and other foreign sources. \nOn the other hand, there is excess liquidity in the banking sector as banks are not willing to lend \nto private enterprises unless loans are guaranteed by third parties.  \n4.  The  Government  has  facilitated  the  establishment  of  credit  guarantee  companies \n(CGCs) to address market failures\u2014regulated interest rates and asymmetric information\u2014to \ngive  private  enterprises  access  to  finance.  ADB  has  supported  comparative  studies  of \ninternational credit guarantees to promote the development of private enterprises, including \nthose of USA, UK, and Japan. \n5.  Many local governments and business communities established CGCs in the mid-1990s. \nBy the end of 2004, more than 3,000 CGCs and reguarantee companies were registered.4 \nSome CGCs have made progress in the past few years, particularly in the areas of institutional \ncapacity, risk management, recognition and registration of collateral, and providing better value-\nadded  services  to  private  enterprises  (such  as  market  access  and  managerial  training). \nHowever, serious challenges remain for the CGC industry\u2014including limited coverage; limited \n                                                           \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 16 May 2005. \n2  Only 90,581 private enterprises were registered by the National Bureau of Industry of Commerce in 1989. This has \nincreased 33 times from 1993 to 2003; registered capital has increased 52 times; employment has risen 12 times; \nand revenue has increased 48 times. By 2004, there were 3.44 million private enterprises with a total registered \ncapital of 4,214 billion yuan (CNY), 47 million employees, and revenue of CNY2,008 billion.  \n3  \u201cPolicy Directives Regarding Encouraging the Development of Private Sector\u201d, issued on 19 February 2005. \n4  Despite a large number of CGCs in operation, in aggregate they serve less than 10% of total number of SMEs and \nmeet 1\u20133% of financing needs of SME borrowers. Cumulatively by mid 2004, these CGCs supported over 48,000 \nSME borrowers with a total of CNY126.7 billion, representing a multiplier of 4.4 times. \n ", "2   \nfinancial, technical, and risk management capability; lack of risk-sharing arrangements with \nbanks;  lack  of  a  consistent  regulatory  system;  and  lack  of  risk  transferring  and  sharing \nmechanisms (such as coguarantees and reguarantees). \n6.  The PRC has been the most attractive destination for foreign capital in Asia for more \nthan a decade, primarily attracted by immense market potential and competitive factor prices. \nHowever,  the  domestic  private  sector\u2014particularly  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises \n(SMEs)\u2014has not been able to tap into these financial resources. Foreign financial institutions, \nincluding ADB, find it hard to formulate practical projects for private sector finance because of \nlack of effective intermediation mechanisms to channel financial support. \n7.  In an effort to facilitate the use of foreign capital in private sector development, the \nNational Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) recently completed a detailed NCG \nproposal, aimed at attracting funding support from foreign and domestic resources\u2014particularly \nfrom institutional investors\u2014to support private sector finance. The NCG is expected to have \nfollowing features: 5 \n(i)  The fund\u2019s objective is to (a) support private sector development in the PRC by \nfacilitating  access  to  finance,  and  (b)  establish  an  effective  institutional \nframework and funding mechanism at the central government level to streamline \ndevelopment of the CGC industry. \n(ii)  The  fund  will  be  multi-tranched  with  the  first  tranche  targeted  at  $1  billion \nequivalent.  Funding  sources  will  include  (a)  loans  from  international  donors, \n(b) grants  from  international  donors,  and  (c)  capital  contributions  by  private \nenterprises. \n(iii)  The NCG\u2019s scope of business will be to support CGCs through equity investment, \nloans, coguarantees, and reguarantees. In the case of equity investment, the exit \nstrategy  will  include  initial  public  offerings,  buy-backs,  and  mergers  and \nacquisitions. \n(iv)  NCG income will be from investment yields, loan interests, coguarantee and \nreguarantee fees, and advisory service fees. \n(v)  The  sponsors  will  ensure  that  NCG  adopts  (a)  sound corporate  governance \nprinciples,  (b)  market-based  operations,  (c)  high  standard  of  internal  control \n(particularly regarding risk management), (d) highest degree of professionalism \namong its staff, and (e) minimum state interference. \n(vi)  NCG will be managed by one or more professional fund management companies \nand custodians, which will be competitively selected and approved by financial \nmarket regulators. \n8.  NDRC has worked in close coordination with other ministries\u2014particularly the Finance \nDepartment of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC)\u2014to develop \nthe NCG proposal. By the end of 2004, a concept paper had been submitted to the State \nCouncil  and  received  positive  endorsement.  NDRC  has  invited  ADB  to  participate  in  the \nestablishment and operation of the NCG through financing and technical support. \n9.  Development of the private sector and private enterprises is a strategic objective of ADB. \nADB\u2019s operational objectives are to facilitate private enterprises\u2019 access to finance and promote \nthe development of the financing and legal infrastructure for private enterprises. ADB helped \ndraft the SME Promotion Law (29 June 2002) and establish policy and regulatory framework for \n                                                           \n5  Subject to State Council\u2019s approval.  ", "      3\nSME CGCs, based on international best practice, through previous TAs.6 ADB also helped the \nAll-China  Federation  of  Industry  and  Commerce  to  identify  constraints  faced  by  private \nenterprises and the domestic private sector,7 whose output became an essential input into the \nPRC private sector assessment.8 ADB disseminated these findings and sought the views of \ngovernment agencies and market participants on the design of potential reforms. Through joint-\nefforts of ADB\u2019s public and private operations, ADB\u2019s Private Sector Department made an equity \ninvestment in a majority private-owned CGC.9  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The  TA  will  improve  private  enterprise  access  to  financial  services  and  financial \nresources. NCG is expected to be an effective and sustainable mechanism for the use of foreign \nand private sector capital for private enterprises. The TA will assist in the effective use of NCGs, \nensuring  timely  drawdown  of  NCG  proceeds  while  maintaining  prudent  risk  exposure  and \ncomplete compliance with regulatory requirements, in line with international best practices. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will establish a proper NCG fund governance structure to maximize political, \nfinancial, economic, and social impacts; and optimize risk and capital allocation for NCG, while \nensuring regulatory compliance and financial sustainability, specifically to \n(i)  address policy and regulatory issues necessary to establish NCG, assess the \nlevel of funding required, identify potential NCG funding sources and scope of \noperations, and design a fund governance structure aimed at optimizing political, \nfinancial, economic, and social impacts, by  \n(a)  reviewing the existing government policy and regulatory environment for \nspecial purpose funds (such as the NCG) and identifying a strategy for \nNCG\u2019s establishment;  \n(b)  examining demand and supply of private enterprise credit guarantees, the \ncompetitive landscape of CGCs, and cost of capital; \n(c)  evaluating major benefits and costs of NCG operations and measuring \ndevelopment effectiveness in terms of business performance, economic \nsustainability, private sector development, foreign capital utilization, and \nstreamlining of government functionalities; and \n(d)  conducting  thorough  financial  and  economic  analyses  and  poverty \nanalysis  for  NCG,  and  formulating  a  capacity  building  and  training \nprogram for NCG staff. \n                                                           \n6  (i) ADB. 2000.

These  will  include,  but  not  be  limited  to, \nmacroeconomic risk, market risk, key personnel risk, exit risk, legal and \nregulatory risks, risk of government intervention, and general business \nrisks; \n(b)  developing eligibility criteria for obtaining NCG support in forms of equity \ndebt,  reguarantee  and  coguarantee,  and  assistance  for  institutional \nstrengthening  based  on  sound  banking,  commercial,  and  financial \nprinciples; \n(c)  preparing operational guidelines for CGC credit analysis and provide a \nuniform  set  of  norms  embracing  internal  controls  and \nprudential/operational standards; and \n(d)  streamlining  business  scope  and  plans  for  investee  guarantee  or \nreguarantee companies, implementing a comprehensive training program \nfor investee CGC staff (with special emphasis on risk assessment, rating, \npricing,  and  management  concepts),  and  ensuring  social  and \nenvironmental safeguards. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $900,000 equivalent, comprising $420,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $480,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $700,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange costs and \n$280,000 equivalent of the local currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB's TA funding program. The Government will provide the remaining $200,000 of local \ncurrency costs in kind, to cover office accommodation, counterpart staff, transportation, and \nother related services. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  NDRC\u2019s Foreign Capital Utilization Department will be the Executing Agency (EA). A \nleading group will be set up comprising officials of NDRC, MOF, and PBC to provide policy \nguidance for NCG operations as well liaison with other relevant ministries and government \nbodies.
