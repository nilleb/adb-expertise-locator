The  Government  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  and  the \nGovernment of Thailand have requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) regional technical \nassistance (TA) to coordinate the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS): North-South Economic \nCorridor Bridge Project. The TA was identified as a priority regional transport project under the \nADB-supported  GMS  Economic  Cooperation  Program  and  is  included  in  GMS:  Regional \nCooperation Strategy and Program.1 A Fact-Finding Mission visited the Lao PDR and Thailand \nfrom 6 to 15 September 2004, and its Follow-Up Mission visited from 29 September to 1 \nOctober 2004 and on 2 November 2004 to obtain the Governments\u2019 concurrence with the goals, \npurpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference for the TA.2 A preliminary project framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The GMS North-South Economic Corridor Program is one of 11 flagship GMS programs. \nIt was endorsed for implementation by the GMS ministers at the Eleventh GMS Ministerial \nConference in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, in November 2002, seeking to strengthen infrastructure \nlinkages and facilitate cross-border trade. The Chiang Rai-Kunming via the Lao PDR Road \nImprovement Project is one of the key subprojects under the GMS: North-South Economic \nCorridor Project. The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) will complete the \nupgrading of the Kunming-Mohan section (690 kilometers [km]) to expressway and high-grade \nroad standard by December 2004. In 2002, ADB approved a $30 million loan for the GMS: \nNorthern Economic Corridor Project,3 with cofinancing of approximately $60 million  from the \ngovernments of the PRC and Thailand. This project upgrades and rehabilitates Road 3 from \nBoten to Houayxay in the Lao PDR (228 km), which effectively connects Chiang Rai in Thailand \nand Kunming in the PRC through the Lao PDR, and will be completed by early 2007. The \nferryboat provides cross-border transport services between  Houayxay and Chiang Khong in \nThailand across the Mekong River. \n3.  Poverty reduction, which is ADB\u2019s overarching objective in the GMS, is to be achieved \nby implementing the GMS vision for enhanced connectivity, increased competitiveness, and a \ngreater sense of community. ADB\u2019s strategy for 2004\u20132008 supports pro-poor and sustainable \ngrowth by strengthening connectivity, facilitating cross-border movements and tourism, and \nintegrating national markets to promote economic efficiency and private sector development. \nAccording to the prefeasibility study for the GMS: Northern Economic Corridor Project,4 there \nwould be a considerable bottleneck along the corridor if a bridge across the Mekong River to \nconnect Houayxay and Chiang Khong is not constructed. The ferry facilities to cross  the \n                                                 \n1  Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program 2004-2008, The GMS \u2013 Beyond Borders in March 2004. The original \ntitle of the Project is \u201cGMS-ECS (Economic Cooperation Strategy) Cooperation Bridge.\u201d The Government of the \nLao PDR expressed later no intention to borrow $10 million for the Bridge Project. ADB is still requested to \ncoordinate the Bridge Project between the two countries as a neutral catalyst, even though ADB will not finance the \nBridge Project. Accordingly, the nature of the TA changed from project preparatory to advisory. A new concept \npaper on this TA was approved by the Vice President on 18 November 2004. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 23 August 2004. \n3  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Greater Mekong Subregion: Northern Economic Corridor Project. Manila \n(Loan 1989). \n4  ADB. 2002.  Technical Assistance for Preparing the Greater Mekong Subregion: Northern Economic Corridor \nProject. Manila (TA 3817). ", "2 \nMekong River will prove inadequate once the cross-border traffic grows beyond present levels. \nThe bridge is proposed to improve connectivity along the north-south axis of the GMS, which \nwould complete the Corridor spanning northern Thailand, northern Lao PDR, and Yunnan \nProvince in the PRC, and allow the Corridor to meet the forecast traffic growth. \n \n4.  The existing ferry services consist of an open boat for passengers and an irregular \nvehicular  ferry.  The  present  ferry  cost  is  $50  per  vehicle  crossing,  which  is  considered \nexcessive due to the low traffic volume. The vehicular ferry has no customs and immigration \nfacilities  for  people,  and  can  only  clear  vehicles.  The  bridge  will  (i) facilitate trade and \ndevelopment between and among Yunnan Province in the PRC, the Lao PDR, and Thailand; (ii) \nreduce transportation costs in the Corridor; and (iii) increase the efficiency of moving goods and \npassengers. \n \n5.  The  prefeasibility  study  for  the  GMS:  Northern  Economic  Corridor  Project  made  a \npreliminary bridge site analysis. The terrain changes from a wide flat valley with a meandering \nriver near  Houayxay and Chiang Khong, to a narrow valley with steep-sided ridges, which \nconstrict the river course, around 5 to 10 km upstream and downstream from these towns. Two \npossible sites for the bridge (central site and southern site) were proposed in the prefeasibility \nstudy. The southern site has been considered as the least-cost and predominant option so far. \nHowever, the site for the cross-border facilities to be constructed at both sides of the bridge is \nvery  limited,  and  development  potential  is  also  very  limited.  The  central  site  has  been \nconsidered as the alternative option. The bridge will be longer and river stability within the banks \nis poor. However, sufficient areas at both sides will accommodate the cross-border facilities, \nand extensive development near the bridge can be expected. The preliminary bridge site \nanalysis did not include any geological investigation. Economic impacts on the project influence \nareas  were  not  considered.  Therefore,  there  is  a  large  degree  of  uncertainty  about  the \nrecommendation. Furthermore, there may be new sites  better than the central and southern \nsites. \n \n6.  To select the best site for the bridge and make a preliminary design of the bridge, an \nengineering study including geologic, topographic, hydraulic, and hydrologic investigations; \neconomic and financial analyses; and an initial social and environmental assessment are \nrequired. The governments of the Lao PDR and Thailand requested ADB, which is a neutral \ncatalyst of the Bridge Project as well as a GMS coordinator, to provide the TA to select the best \nsite for the bridge where overall benefits of the Bridge Project may be maximized. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The TA will select the best site for the bridge in light of the engineering survey, economic \nand financial analyses, and initial social and environmental impacts assessment. Outline terms \nof reference for consulting services are in Appendix 2. Also, the TA will hold coordination \nmeetings to facilitate mutual agreements on the Bridge Project among the governments of PRC, \nthe Lao PDR, and Thailand, and ADB so that the ensuing stage of the Bridge Project such as \ndetailed designs of the bridge, construction supervision, toll arrangement, cross-border traffic \noperation, and bridge maintenance may be started. \n ", "3  \n8.  One  of  the  key  outputs  is  the  recommendation  for  the  bridge  site  based  on  the \nengineering, economic, financial, social, and environmental aspects. Another is project cost, \ntechnical  requirements  and  preliminary  design  drawings,  economic  viability,  and  toll \narrangement for the bridge to be constructed on the recommended site. The investment project \nwill construct the bridge, approach roads, and associated infrastructure improvements in the \nLao PDR and Thailand, based on the outputs of the TA. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  ADB will engage an international consulting firm to make a feasibility study to help \ndecide the location of the bridge. An international bridge engineer will lead the feasibility study, \nwhich  will  cover  engineering,  economic,  financial,  social  and  environmental  aspects.  The \nengineering study will include a geological survey that involves boring at the site options, and a \nriver morphology analysis. The bridge should have sufficient navigation clearance for inland \nwaterway transport along the Mekong River. The economic study will assess the development \nof the project influence areas. The financial study will analyze toll levels. The social and \nenvironmental study will cover resettlement at the site options, impacts on people engaged in \nthe ferryboat business and regular users of the ferryboat services, impact on indigenous people, \nif any, and initial environmental impact assessment. A final report will consolidate these key \noutputs. \n \n10.  In  parallel  with  the  feasibility  study,  ADB  will  organize  quadripartite  coordination \nmeetings with the governments of the PRC, the Lao PDR, and Thailand. The meetings will \nreview reports of the feasibility study and determine the bridge site. The meetings will discuss \nhow  the  detailed  bridge  design will be made, how the detailed design and a construction \nsupervision consultant for bridge construction will be recruited and financed, and how the bridge \nwill be operated and maintained.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $415,000  equivalent,  comprising  foreign \nexchange of $330,000 and local currency of $85,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. Detailed cost \nestimates are in Appendix 3. The Government of the Lao PDR will assign counterpart staff, \nprovide office accommodation for the TA consultant team, and provide necessary inputs in kind: \ndata, statistics, reports, and maps. The Government of Thailand will assign counterpart staff and \nprovide necessary inputs such as data, statistics, reports, and maps. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The Executing Agency for the TA is ADB. The Infrastructure Division (MKID) of the \nMekong Department (MKRD) will take the lead in implementing the TA in collaboration with the \nOperation and Coordination Division (MKOC) of MKRD organizing the GMS activities. The \nMinistry of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction will be the counterpart agency in \nthe Lao PDR for the TA, with the director general of the Department of Roads providing \nguidance, support, counterpart staff, documentation, and other services that may be required. \nThe Department of Highways (DOH), Office of National Economic and Social Development \nBoard, and Ministry of Finance will be the counterpart agencies in Thailand for the TA, with the \ndirector of the Planning Department of DOH providing guidance, support, counterpart staff, \ndocumentation, and other services that may be required. \n ", "4 \n13.  The TA will be undertaken by an ni ternational consulting firm for about 24 person-\nmonths: 12 international and 12 domestic consulting services. The international consultants \n(person-months are in parentheses) will include a bridge engineer/team leader (4), a hydrologist \n(2), a road engineer (1), a transport economist (3), and a social and environmental specialist (2). \nThe domestic consultants in the Lao PDR will include a bridge/road engineer (2), a hydrologist \n(2), a resettlement specialist (1), and an environmental specialist (1). The domestic consultants \nin Thailand will provide the same input. ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Biodata technical proposals will be used, as the contract \nbudget is less than $400,000. All procurement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented for 12 months starting in January 2005 and ending in \nDecember 2005. The lead consultant will complete the feasibility study by July 2005. At least \nthree quadripartite coordination meetings will be held during TA implementation. The first \nmeeting will be held at the initial stage of the feasibility study. The consultant will explain the \nplan of the consulting services and the decision making for selecting the site for the bridge. The \nsecond meeting will be held at the final stage of the feasibility study. The consultant will present \noutputs and recommendation. The third meeting will be held at the appropriate time to discuss \nadministrative and financial arrangements for detailed design and bridge construction. Technical \ncoordination meetings attended by the governments of the Lao PDR and Thailand, and ADB will \nalso be held during the TA study. \n \n15.  Since  the  TA  is  advisory  in  nature,  it  will  not  prepare  a  resettlement  plan,  ethnic \nminority/social action plan, or environmental management plan for the Bridge Project. However, \nit is necessary to ensure that appropriate measures are taken by the governments of the Lao \nPDR and Thailand for socially and environmentally sound development of the bridge. In this \ncontext, as the governments undertake future works for detailed engineering design, they will \nprepare these plans based on the respective governments' safeguard policies and comply with \nthe plans during implementation of the Bridge Project. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $415,000 on a grant basis for \nCoordinating the Greater Mekong Subregion: North-South Economic Corridor Bridge Project, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.
