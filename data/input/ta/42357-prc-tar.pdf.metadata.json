The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA) for promoting a more inclusive and \neffective  disaster  risk  management  system.  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  the  PRC  in \nNovember  2008  to  discuss  and  reach  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  TA \nobjectives,  scope,  terms  of  reference,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan,  and  implementation \narrangements. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s 2008 country program for the PRC.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The PRC, with a population of 1.3 billion and a vast expanse of territory, has complex \nclimatic  and  geological  conditions,  which  make  it  prone  to  diverse  disasters  and  natural \ncalamities  such  as  typhoons,  earthquakes,  floods,  snowstorms,  sandstorms,  landslides, \ndesertification, and drought. The country has been roiled by 50 earthquakes with intensity of \nover 7.0 on the Richter scale in the last 50 years, four of these with intensity of over 8.0. The \nnumber  of  major  disasters  and  natural  calamities  has  surged  in  recent  years,  causing \nsubstantial losses both to the people and to the economy. Each year from 1978 to 2007, on \naverage, more than 7 million people have been dislocated, 45.78 million hectares of crop area \nhave been affected, nearly 3 million houses have collapsed, and the economy has suffered a \ndirect loss of over CNY170 billion. The rapid economic growth of the country has made the \nimpact  of  these  disasters  more  significant.  The  average  annual  losses  due  to  disasters \nincreased to CNY203.4 billion in 2000\u20132007 from CNY172.4 billion in the 1990s.  \n \n3.  More recently, the Wenchuan earthquake in Sichuan province affected 10 provinces and \nmunicipalities, and caused major loss of life and property. A total of 69,226 people died, 17,923 \nwere reported missing, and about 1.5 million were evacuated. About 46 million people in all \nwere affected, 8 million homes were destroyed, and 24.5 million homes were damaged. All \nservices,  including  communications  (highways,  aviation,  and  railways),  telecommunication \nservices, water supply, electricity and power supply, and irrigation, were disrupted. Industry was \nseriously affected and many schools and educational institutes were extensively damaged. The \nlocal economy was badly hit and the damage was extensive and covered all aspects of human \nlife. The poor and vulnerable were affected the most. \n \n4.  The  Government  responded  rapidly  and  with  openness  to  the  disaster  and  took \nproactive steps at the highest level to mitigate it. The State Disaster Relief Commission initiated \na level 1 emergency contingency plan. Such a plan covers the most serious class of natural \ndisasters. The Prime Minister himself directed the relief operations in the Sichuan province in \nthe first few days. Emergency medical teams, relief teams, fire rescue teams, the army, and the \npolice  force  were  engaged  in  the  initial  rescue  and  relief  operation,  which  spread  across \n58 counties and cities. The Government is still undertaking reconstruction.  \n \n5.  As demonstrated in the Wenchuan earthquake, the central Government holds the central \nand most important role in disaster risk management. It has an established system for dealing \nwith emergencies and provides almost all the support. The role of the provincial and local \ngovernments, and of other stakeholders like private sector and civil society, is not so well \ndefined,  and  they  look  to  the central  Government  to  manage  disasters.  In  the Wenchuan \nearthquake, the local public, civil society, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), the private \nsector, business enterprises, and the international community begged to assist in the immediate \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 November 2008. \n ", "2 \nrelief and restoration work. However, without a proper mechanism for social contribution to \nnatural disaster relief, these efforts were largely localized and uncoordinated. The disaster risk \nmanagement system in the PRC does not provide for coordination of relief efforts with other \nstakeholders and agencies that are eager to contribute. \n \n6.  Also, the system of public participation in disaster risk management is not developed \nand in particular does not have the legal basis it has in many developed countries or the \nnormative basis in many other developing countries. The legal basis is important for individuals, \nbusiness enterprises, both domestic and foreign, and other stakeholders to participate. This \nfacilitates greater participation from the private sector, encourages public-private partnerships, \nand reduces the burden on the Government. The disaster risk management system in the PRC \nalso does not have an institutional mechanism for coordinating relief work and contributions \nfrom the private sector and other stakeholders. Such an institutional mechanism would pinpoint \nresponsibility and accountability and thereby make disaster risk management more efficient and \neffective. Another related aspect is the availability of personnel with the required skills for \ndisaster risk management. Disaster risk management has few specialists in the PRC, and not a \nsingle  university  or  reputable  educational  institute  offers  it  as  a  discipline  of  study.  Basic \nknowledge of disaster and accident management is generally lacking and there is no training or \ncapacity building at the local and grassroots level. Building capacity at the grassroots level to \nhandle  disasters  and  provide  immediate  support  is  one  of  the  most  important  aspects  of \nmanaging disasters more efficiently. \n \n7.  The PRC Government believes it has much to learn from other countries when it comes \nto  involving  civil  society,  the  private  sector,  NGOs,  business  enterprises,  and  other  social \ngroups in disaster risk management. It has therefore sought ADB\u2019s assistance in (i) reviewing \nthe  current  disaster  risk  management  system  in  the  PRC;  (ii) studying  the  disaster  risk \nmanagement systems in developed countries, particularly with respect to the participation of \nstakeholders like the private sector, civil society, business enterprises, and NGOs, and learning \nfrom the best international experiences; (iii) preparing a strategy for disaster risk management \nthat will facilitate greater involvement of the society and the private sector and can be adopted \nby the PRC; and (iv) pilot-testing some initiatives that could demonstrate a more inclusive and \nparticipatory approach to disaster risk management.  \n \n8.  ADB  has  been  a  development  partner  of  the  PRC  since  1986,  and  has  provided \nsubstantial support for the development of its poor central and western regions. A $1 million TA \nfor the Wenchuan (Sichuan) earthquake2 is supporting (i) a review of how Sichuan province \nresponded to the earthquake within the existing disaster management framework; and (ii) a \npreliminary assessment of damage to, and need for, physical and social infrastructure, based on \nthe Government\u2019s own assessment, which could be a focus of ADB\u2019s subsequent restoration \nprograms or projects. ADB provided two policy notes to the PRC Government on (i) post \ndisaster  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  and  (ii)  key  issues  for  developing  earthquake \ninsurance in the PRC. These notes provided key lessons from the international experiences and \nmade recommendations for possible adoption by the PRC Government. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2008.

The proposed TA is expected to lead to a more responsive, efficient, and effective \ndisaster risk management system in the PRC. Its outcome will be a strategy for disaster risk \nmanagement that is more inclusive and participatory and can be adopted by the Government.  \n \n10.  The TA will support (i) a review of the current disaster risk management system in the \nPRC;3 (ii) research on and review of best international practices and experiences in disaster risk \nmanagement  in  selected  developed  countries  with  similar  disaster-relevant  issues;  (iii)  the \npreparation of a strategy and the recommendation of actions for a more inclusive and effective \ndisaster  risk  management  system,  which  the  Government  can  implement;  (iv)  a  capacity \ndevelopment program to build knowledge and capacity for disaster risk management; and \n(v) pilot-testing of a few demonstration projects that can be replicated. The study will make use \nof experience in disaster risk management in other relevant countries, and involve the active \nparticipation of stakeholders in the PRC. The key findings and recommendations of the final \nreport will be contained in a policy note to be submitted to the State Council and senior officials \nof the PRC Government for implementation. Close collaboration and sharing of study outputs \nand lessons with other domestic and international partners will be maintained. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  To  achieve  the  objectives  of  the  TA,  consultants  will  analyze  the  disaster  risk \nmanagement  system  in  the  PRC  and  compare  it  with  counterpart  systems  in  developed \ncountries  such  as  Japan,  New  Zealand,  and  Singapore  and  in  developing  countries  like \nBangladesh,  India,  Indonesia,  and  Viet  Nam.  The  consultants  will  (i) review  the  working \nprinciples, systems, and methods of disaster risk management in each of these countries, and \nidentify the comparative advantages of each system through an analysis of its strengths and \nweaknesses, including the features, performance, and experience of using the system, and in \nparticular the key areas that encourage more active participation from the public, civil society, \nNGOs, business enterprises, and individuals throughout the country; (ii) prepare a disaster risk \nmanagement strategy and recommending rules and regulations, working principles, institutional \nstructure, methods, technology, and personnel and training needs for a more inclusive system \nthat can be adopted in the PRC, as well as the key institutional, technical, legal, and other \nissues that must be dealt with; (iii) provide capacity-building support through international and \ndomestic training and knowledge transfer to enhance skills and knowledge in preparation for \nparticipatory  and  effective  disaster  risk  management;  and  (iv) carry  out  pilot  projects  to \ndemonstrate a more participatory, effective, and efficient disaster risk management system that \ncan be replicated elsewhere in the country.  \n \n12.  The  pilot  projects  may  involve  managing  disaster  risks  in  public  places,  industry, \ntransportation, emergency rescue, and county emergency management system projects. At \nleast two of the pilot projects would be implemented in the earthquake-affected provinces of \nSichuan and Shaanxi. The pilot projects will test the disaster risk management in real life \nsituations and include mock drills. The consultants will use the experience in other countries, \nengage the active participation of stakeholders in the PRC, implement national and international \n                                                 \n3  Particularly in relation to the guidelines contained in the National Plan for Comprehensive Disaster Reduction \nduring the 11th Five-Year Plan period (2006\u20132010), which was announced in August 2007. ", "4 \ntraining programs, and recommend a set of actions to help the Government set up a more \ninclusive and effective disaster risk management system in the PRC. The recommendations \nshould be realistic and capable of being implemented by the Government. \n \n13.  The TA will be undertaken in close consultation with the Government, the Promotion \nCenter for Emergency Assistance (PCEA) of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and other relevant \nagencies. Key activities will include (i) a review of available information on the disaster, from \nstudies made by the Government, ADB,4 other multilateral institutions, and other agencies; \n(ii) data analysis; and (iii) consultations with other stakeholders. Workshops\u2014one each at the \ninception, interim, and draft final report stages of TA implementation\u2014will be organized to \ndiscuss and review the TA findings.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $840,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $650,000 with a grant \nfrom  its  TA  funding  program.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remainder,  equivalent  to \n$190,000,  which  will  cover  office  accommodation  and  the  counterpart  staff  required  to \nimplement the TA. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  As the Executing Agency, PCEA, the nodal agency for public participation in disaster risk \nmanagement, will supervise and monitor the TA activities, facilitate the work of the consultants, \nensure that the PCEA benefits from their experience, and provide adequate counterpart staff \nwith relevant work experience during TA implementation. The agency will set up a project \nimplementation unit to oversee day-to-day implementation, coordinate with different agencies \nand  other  relevant  organizations,  and  facilitate  the  sharing  of  information  and  lessons.  A \nsteering committee, also to be set up by the PCEA, will guide the consultants and discuss their \nreports at the inception, interim, and draft final report stages. Workshops will be held at these \nsame stages of the TA and will be attended by representatives of PCEA, the  Ministry of \nFinance, other relevant agencies, ADB, and the consultants. A seminar will be organized after \nthe final report is prepared. The final report will be published at the end of the TA.  \n \n16.  A team of international consultants in association with national consultants will be hired by \nADB through quality and cost-based selection (in a ratio of 80:20) using simplified technical \nproposal  procedures  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). The TA will require about 12 person-months of international and \nabout  15  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  The  international  and  national \nconsultants will have expertise in the following fields of disaster risk management: (i) concept, \norganization  and  institutional  arrangements,  design,  and  implementation;  (ii)  logistics, \nmanagement  information  and  communication  systems,  and  technical  issues;  (iii)  legal  and \nlegislative aspect; (iv) capacity building; and (v) implementation of pilot projects in disaster risk \nmanagement. The terms of reference for the TA are in Appendix 3.  \n \n17.  The  TA  will  begin  in  March  2009  and  will  be  completed  by  December  2009.  The \nconsultants will be fielded in March 2009. They will work over 6 months and complete the \ndisaster risk management strategy by September 2009. The pilot projects will be completed by \nDecember 2009. PCEA will provide the consultants with the documents and materials they need \n                                                 \n4  Including the outputs of ADB. 2008.
