INTRODUCTION \n1.  Access to reliable and cost-effective sources of modern forms of energy is a prerequisite \nfor growth and productivity improvement and can help Indonesia avoid the pitfalls of the middle-\nincome trap. While this is particularly true for the country\u2019s manufacturing and commercial \ncenters, it is also important that access to modern forms of energy be available to millions of \nIndonesians living in remote areas across the far-flung archipelago. Most indications are that \nIndonesia\u2019s energy sector is underperforming.1 Energy security concerns have increased in \nrecent years. A new president and executive team assumed office on 20 October 2014, and \nreforming the energy sector appears to be  one of their key priorities. The Government of \nIndonesia has requested assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to take stock of \noverall regulation in the energy sector and to develop innovative policy proposals, implementing \nregulations, and improved implementation plans that can help pave the way for a sustainable \nand inclusive energy future for the country. \n \n2.  Consultation missions were fielded in July 2014 and October 2014 during which ADB \nobtained  the  government\u2019s  concurrence  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  for  consultants. 2 The \ntechnical assistance (TA) concept paper was approved on 20 October 2014. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Fossil fuels currently dominate Indonesia\u2019s energy mix. While Indonesia is particularly \nwell-endowed  with  geothermal,  biomass,  solar,  wind,  and  hydropower  renewable  energy \npotential, it lags behind its Southeast Asian regional peers in its use of these resources for \npower generation or transport. With domestic oil production declining, Indonesia is increasingly \ndependent on imported oil to meet its burgeoning domestic demand. The rate of growth of its \ngas production has also stalled. In 2013, the country signed agreements to begin importing \nliquefied  natural  gas,  and  it  plans  to  build  a  series  of  floating  storage  and  regasification \ninstallations to make further use of this external energy source.  \n \n4.  The electricity subsector epitomizes many of the challenges facing the energy sector \noverall. Efforts to expand the generation systems are behind schedule, and transmission and \ndistribution also suffer from infrastructure deficits and underinvestment. While the country\u2019s \nrevised National Energy Policy (2014) aims to achieve 79 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity \nby 2020 and 115 GW by 2025, the total as of 2013 was only about 45 GW. Long delays in the \ncompletion of projects under two fast-track programs for generation expansion and continued \ndelays in large fossil-fired, geothermal, and hydropower power projects in the country suggest \n                                                \n1  National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS). 2014. Medium-Term Economic Infrastructure Strategy\u2013\nBackground Report for RPJMN 2015\u20132019, and recent reports by the International Energy Agency and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). \n2  The government is currently developing its next medium-term development plan (RPJMN) for 2015\u20132019, which \nwill  clearly  emphasize  expanded  infrastructure  investments,  increased  deployment  of  the  country\u2019s  energy \nresources for domestic use, and efficiency improvements in the energy sector. These priorities are to be reflected \nin ADB\u2019s draft country partnership strategy, 2015\u20132019 for Indonesia and the draft energy sector assessment, \nstrategy, and road map that are being finalized. The TA is also in line with ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy \n2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. The midterm review emphasizes the \nneed for inclusive economic growth, infrastructure development, and policy-based engagements in middle-income \ncountries. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 October 2014. \n ", "2   \nthat  these  targets  may  be  difficult  to  meet  under  a  business  as  usual  scenario.4 Related \ninvestments in transmission and distribution are also lagging. The power system is becoming \nless reliable, and blackouts occurred in Sumatra and Java in 2014.5 All of these factors severely \nconstrain the country\u2019s ability to provide power for industrial and commercial users and connect \nnew households to the grid. At the same time, price distortions stemming from government \nsubsidies have led to bloated energy use and constitute an obstacle to greater energy efficiency \nand conservation. \n \n5.  More than 50 million people, or about 20% of the nation\u2019s population, continue to lack \naccess to modern forms of energy (footnote 1). The high cost of delivering fossil fuels to small \nislands and remote areas in eastern Indonesia, low power loads and the limited ability of \nhouseholds to pay, lack of interconnected grids that can support larger generating units, and a \nconstrained policy environment have made  the  State  Electricity  Company  (PT  Perusahaan \nListrik Negara, or PLN) reluctant to add new consumers. Nevertheless, these regions have rich \nrenewable energy potential from solar, micro hydro, wind, and biomass resources that could \nsupport a range of grid-connected, mini grid, and household systems. The government has \nbeen pursuing some isolated programs. Examples include a PLN solar photovoltaic program in \nEastern Indonesia, and a micro-grid-based electrification program undertaken by the Ministry of \nEnergy  and  Mineral  Resources  (MEMR).  However,  the  rural  electrification  effort  lacks  a \ncomprehensive  regulatory  framework,  a  national  program  with  the  requisite  road  map,  an \ninstitutional framework, and the necessary budgetary resources. As a result, the country\u2019s rural \nelectrification programs are performing poorly. The government\u2019s goal of providing access to \nelectricity for 90% of the country\u2019s people by 2020 may well be delayed by another decade, at \nthe current rate of new connections. \n \n6.  Analysis of the energy sector has highlighted several of its persistent challenges and \nprovided potential policy solutions to the problems, as well as road maps to implement the steps \nnecessary. These studies include an in-depth review of the country\u2019s energy policy in 2014 by \nthe International Energy Agency and a white paper on energy sector strategy being drafted by \nADB  to  support  the  government\u2019s  upcoming  medium-term  development  plan  (RPJMN)  for \n2015\u20132019.6 In 2014, the MEMR prepared a natural gas master plan that includes several \npolicy proposals. The government recognizes the crucial impact that energy will have on the \ncountry\u2019s future growth and has taken important initiatives on multiple fronts in the sector during \n2014.  \n \n7.  Improving the efficiency of energy markets. For example, the government, which is \nresponsible for setting energy prices, increased the price of a 12 kilogram liquefied petroleum \ngas canister by 23% in 2014 and plans to increase it every 6 months until the price meets \nmarket levels by January 2016. The government also announced a nearly 30% hike in transport \nfuel prices in late 2014. The government has also lowered subsidies for electricity and is moving \ntoward a cost-reflective tariff. In 2013, the MEMR raised tariffs by an average of 5% in quarterly \nphases, and in 2014, the government announced a further average tariff hike of almost 13% \nwhich is to be phased in during the course of the year. The government is also trying to move \naway from the current framework of the public service obligation wherein PLN is reimbursed for \nthe difference between its actual costs of operation (plus a margin) and its revenue. Alternate \nschemes  under  consideration  are  based  on  the  benchmarking  of  controllable  costs  and \n                                                \n4  The reasons for the delays vary and include issues related to land acquisition and permitting, and tendering. \n5  In 2013, the national averages for the distribution network\u2019s system average interruption frequency index (7.26) \nand the system average interruption duration index (5.76) were relatively good, but regional performance was poor, \nparticularly on the most populous island of Java.  \n6  International Energy Agency. 2014. In-Depth Review of Indonesia\u2019s Energy Policy. Paris. \n ", "  3 \nperformance. The government is also evaluating proposals that would increase private sector \ninvolvement in the upstream and downstream natural gas sectors.  \n  \n8.  Scaling  up  grid-connected  renewable  energy.  In  addition  to  raising  tariffs,  the \ngovernment  is  putting  incentive  mechanisms  in  place  to  support  the  scaling  up  of  grid-\nconnected renewable power. The geothermal sector provides a good example of these efforts. \nIn early 2014, ADB, in collaboration with the World Bank, helped the government develop and \nroll out a new geothermal tariff scheme.7 This scheme moves away from fixed feed-in tariffs8 to \na ceiling price, with tendering approach based on PLN\u2019s avoided costs, differentiated by regions \nof the country. The government, ADB, and other development partners hope that the energy \nsector will be revived by this new scheme, the recent changes in the tariff regime, a newly \nreissued geothermal law that allows geothermal activities in certain forest classifications, and \nrecent financing commitments for two large projects led by independent power producers. In \n2013\u20132014, the government announced a program to support grid-connected solar photovoltaic \nplants through a combination of ceiling prices and tendering. It also announced a feed-in tariff \nfor  waste-to-energy  projects  and  hydropower  projects  of  less  than  10  megawatts.  The \ngovernment is currently considering alternate incentive schemes for supporting grid-connected \nwind energy and is preparing an incentive scheme for biomass-based power produced by using \nagricultural waste or woody biomass as a fuel. \n \n9.  Rural electrification. A series of new government policy initiatives aim to expand rural \naccess to power. The MEMR has chosen Sumba Island in Eastern Indonesia to be what it calls \nan \u201ciconic island.\u201d9 It aims to use renewable energy to expand access to electricity on the island \nfrom the current baseline of about 30% of the population. With support from ADB and other \ndevelopment partners, the government hopes to showcase Sumba as an example of how \nspatial  planning  tools,  technology  approaches,  financing  models,  and  implementation \napproaches using renewable energy can be dovetailed to scale up energy access in remote \nparts  of Indonesia.10 ADB  is  undertaking  a review  of  opportunities for  and  the  challenges \ninvolved in expanding electrification in Eastern Indonesia under the 2013 TA. This analysis will \nserve as the basis for convening a high-level dialogue in early 2015 of related ministries and \ngovernment entities and development partners on how to plan and obtain financing for a large-\nscale rollout of a rural electrification program in Eastern Indonesia.11 \n \n10.  The MEMR is beginning a concerted effort to develop energy-efficiency regulations, \nimplementation rules, and standards to realize savings in the use of energy by appliances and \nin municipal and commercial buildings and street lighting. It has developed specifications and \nprocurement guidelines for upgrading municipal street lighting systems through the use of light-\nemitting diode technology. The MEMR has also developed minimum efficiency performance \nstandards for  air-conditioners. In  2015,  ADB  will  support  the  issuance  of further minimum \n                                                \n7  Government of Indonesia, 2014. Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. Ministerial Regulation 17/2014 July \n8  Feed-in tariff is a firm commitment of a certain premium price to be paid for power from a specific renewable energy \nsource that is fed into the power grid.  \n9 ADB 2013. Mid-term Report: Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Scaling Up Renewable Energy \nAccess in Eastern Indonesia. Manila (TA 8287-INO). \n10 This detailed work complements the ongoing regional energy planning and resource surveys being undertaken by \nthe World Bank, in association with PLN. \n11 ADB plans to organize this workshop with the MEMR and development partners such as the World Bank and the \nUnited Nations Sustainable Energy for All Initiative. The workshop is tentatively scheduled for early 2015. A white \npaper on the challenges and prospects for rural electrification in the country is being prepared under ADB TA 8287: \nScaling Up Renewable Energy Access in Eastern Indonesia.  \n ", "4   \nefficiency performance standards for other appliances by MEMR, including key energy-intensive \nappliances, such as refrigerators and rice cookers.12 \n \n11.  In summary, the government has demonstrated a commitment to addressing challenges \nin the energy sector and enabling the transition to a more sustainable and inclusive energy \nsupply. However, a sustained, comprehensive effort is necessary to translate the targets and \nnew regulations into tangible outcomes in the medium term. This will require (i) development of \nimplementation rules and guidelines, and their dissemination to regional and local governments, \n(ii) development of new regulatory frameworks and institutional mechanisms in such related \nareas as rural electrification and energy efficiency, (iii) a shift to a more market-driven energy \nsector, with the establishment of  economic energy tariffs and greater private sector participation, \nand (iv) improved coordination between the various central ministries and actors concerned at \nthe central and the local government levels. \n \n12.  This policy and advisory TA will help the newly elected government that took office in \nOctober 2014 to consolidate ongoing efforts to reform the sector and implement previously \nannounced regulations and programs. It will also help to develop and put in place the next set of \nmeasures needed to broaden and sustain the reform efforts. The TA will also help identify the \npolicy actions that can be supported under a proposed ADB policy loan that will involve two \nsubprogram tranches of an estimated $400 million each to be processed for approval in 2015 \nand 2016.13 \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact will be a more sustainable and inclusive energy sector in Indonesia. The \noutcome  will  be  the  preparation  of  a regulatory  framework  and  policy  actions  for  a  more \nsustainable and inclusive energy supply. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The outputs will be: (i) the enabling of more efficient energy markets, (ii) development of \na  road  map  for  transitioning  to  cost-reflective  electricity  tariffs  and  energy  prices,  (iii) \ndevelopment of appropriate incentives and programs for scaling up grid-connected renewable \nelectricity supply, and (iv) design of a regulatory and institutional framework for expanding \nenergy access in Eastern Indonesia. Output (i) will include activities focused on improving \nprospects for private sector investments in the natural gas sector, improving the delivery of \nsubsidies to the power sector and improving financing approaches for PLN, while output (ii) \nwould focus on reduction of subsidies. Output (iii) will focus on tariff and non-tariff incentives for \nlarge  renewable  energy  projects,  and  output  (iv)  is  focused  on  enabling  a  planning  and \nimplementation approach to bring affordable electricity to Indonesians who currently do not have \nelectricity  access.  The  outputs  will  be  achieved  through  a  combination  of  policy  dialogue, \nanalytical studies, draft regulation, and support for promulgating improved regulations. It is \nassumed that many of the reform measures that were undertaken before the 2014 election will \nnot be scaled back and that implementation plans already in place will be strengthened. The TA \nbuilds on ADB policy and advisory work carried out under the ongoing TA for Scaling up \n                                                \n12 This work is being financed through ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for Asia Energy Efficiency Accelerator. \nManila (TA 8483-REG). It is being administered by ADB\u2019s Regional and Sustainable Development Department. \n13 It also complements related work being undertaken by development partners, such as work on a gas development \nmaster plan supported by the Government of Australia and the World Bank. \n ", "  5 \nRenewable  Energy  Access  in  Eastern  Indonesia,  as  well  as  the  Asia  Energy  Efficiency \nAccelerator regional TA, which is focused on energy efficiency (footnotes 11 and 12).  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, reports and documents, \nsecretarial assistance, local communication facilities, domestic transportation, and other in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The successful implementation of many of the government\u2019s prior policies, programs, \nand projects has been stymied by a lack of coordination among the various energy sector-\nrelated entities at the central level and between the policy-making bodies at the central level and \nthe implementation actors within the regional and local governments. Therefore, the TA will be \nimplemented within an inter-ministerial and interagency context. The Directorate General for \nEnergy within the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs will be the executing agency. The \nMEMR, the Ministry of Finance, and PLN will be the implementing agencies. Relevant regional \nand local government officials will be included in the policy analyses and training activities as \nappropriate. The TA will be managed and administered by ADB through the Energy Division of \nthe Southeast Asia Department. \n \n17.  It is estimated that a total of 53 person-months of consulting services, comprising 38 \nperson-months  of  international  consultant  services  and  15  person-months  for  a  national \nconsultant, will be required for the TA. Of this, 23 person-months of international consultant \nservices and 15 person-months of a national consultant\u2019s services are to be engaged through \nan international firm. The firm will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time), using quality- and cost-based selection \n(90:10) on the basis of a simplified technical proposal. In addition, an energy analyst (15 \nperson-months, international) will be hired through an individual contract and be based in ADB\u2019s \nIndonesia Resident Mission in Jakarta. The terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \nThe  TA  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will be implemented \nover 36 months from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.
