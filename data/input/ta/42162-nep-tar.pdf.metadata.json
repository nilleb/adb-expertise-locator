INTRODUCTION \n1.  Following the request from the Government of Nepal for capacity development technical \nassistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  strengthen  the  institutional \ncapacities of municipalities, ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy midterm review in 2008 made a \nprovision for TA for Institutional Strengthening of Municipalities.1 Processing the TA in 2009 was \nreconfirmed with the Government in the country program confirmation mission conducted in \nOctober 2008. \n \n2.  An ADB fact-finding mission visited Nepal from 7 to 17 August 2009. This report is based \non the understanding reached with the Government during the mission regarding the impact, \noutcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  outline \nterms of reference for the TA.2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Governance  structure  in  Nepal.  Nepal  has  a  three-tier  governance  structure, \ncomprising the central Government at the top of the hierarchy, followed by district development \ncommittees in the middle, and municipalities and village development committees at the lowest \ntier.  The  Local  Self  Governance  Act,  enacted  in  May  1999,  followed  by  the  Local  Self \nGovernance  Regulation,  1999,  and  Local  Governance  Financial  Rules,  2000,  established \nmunicipalities as self-governing autonomous urban local bodies with a central role in urban \ndevelopment.3  \n \n4.  The Local Self Governance Act has mandated 10 major functions with 68 sub-functions \nto municipalities while 13 more functions are optionally available. Major municipal functions \ninclude  fiscal  administration,  physical  development,  water  resources,  environment  and \nsanitation, education, culture, construction and transportation, health services, social welfare, \nindustries, and tourism. At present, there are 58 municipalities in the country, but most, if not all \nof  them,  are  having  major  difficulties  in  performing  their  functions.  Municipalities  are \ncharacterized  by  inadequate  drinking  water  supply,  sanitation,  transportation,  and  health \nfacilities.  Serious  environmental  issues,  including  an  increased  level  of  vehicular  pollution, \nhaphazard disposal of solid waste, wastewater, and illegal dumping of industrial waste into \nrivers and streams, are emerging because of uncontrolled and haphazard urban development. \nInsufficient financial resources and qualified human resources, and a low level of institutional \ncapacity mean that urban authorities are unable to cope with the growing demand for services \nwith commensurate infrastructural facilities. Issues and challenges that will be addressed in the \nTA are detailed in the subsequent paragraphs.  \n \n5.  Financial management, including revenue enhancement. Mobilization of financial \nresources by municipalities is hampered by lack of a sound financial management system and \ninnovative approaches to develop institutional capacity for managing their financial affairs. With \ngrants and loans from the central Government accounting for a smaller portion of municipalities\u2019 \ntotal revenue, municipalities largely rely on internal revenue generation.4 Although collected and \ndistributed from the central level, the local development fee is in principle categorized as a local \n                                                 \n1  Formerly known as the \u201cStrengthening Urban Institutions and Planning Mechanism.\u201d \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 July 2009.  \n3  The  Local  Governance  Financial  Rules,  2000  were  replaced  by  the  Local  Bodies  Financial  Administration \nRegulation, 2007. \n4  In FY2006, own-source revenue of municipalities (in aggregate), including the local development fee, accounted for \n65.4% of the total revenue. \n ", "2   \nrevenue  source  as  it  compensates  for  the  former  Octroi  tax.5 The  local  development  fee \naccounted for a significant portion of the municipalities\u2019 own revenue (52.8%) and tax revenue \n(74.2%) in FY2006. However, since the import tax (the source of the local development fee) \nmust  be  discontinued  with  the  accession  of  Nepal  to  the  World  Trade  Organization,  the \nGovernment announced the abolishment of the local development fee in the budget speech for \nFY2010 made in July 2009. There is an urgent need to increase the internal revenue by \nassessing potential sources, such as introducing the integrated property tax, broadening the tax \nbase, updating tax valuation, and increasing collection efficiency. Based on a revenue potential \nstudy, a more realistic annual revenue estimate will need to be prepared.6  \n \n6.  An accrual-based accounting system has not been established and is not in use in most \nmunicipalities,7 nor are the internal audit units in place. In most cases, the internal audit is \nirregular and not effective. Backlog of audits is quite common in municipalities. Accumulated \nmisappropriations (expenditure and advances) are high and generally not settled. The practice \nof  periodic  reconciliations  varies  from  municipality  to  municipality  with  reconciliations  done \nmonthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually. Efforts need to be made to improve the accounting \nsystem and reduce misappropriations found in the audit report as well as the time taken for \nreconciliations. Transparency in financial management is another area for improvement.  \n \n7.  Urban  services  delivery.  Municipalities  are  responsible  for  many  types  of  urban \nservices delivery, including solid waste management, water supply and sanitation, public health, \ntransportation, public parks, and markets. However, these services are not provided adequately \nin a cost-effective manner because of a shortage of skilled staff and overall human resources, \nlack of proper planning, inadequate technical knowledge, and low priority to operation and \nmaintenance (O&M). Human resources development through training programs (including field \nvisits to learn from good practices) is crucial to improve overall infrastructure planning, sector \nplanning, project management, and effective and efficient O&M of relevant facilities.   \n \n8.  Geographic information system-based urban mapping. Many municipalities still lack \nproper base maps. They are mostly dependent on 1:25,000 or 1:50,000 scale topographic maps, \nwhich are not sufficient to use for municipal level planning. Moreover, analog maps that are \ncommon in municipalities in Nepal are not updated regularly and do not serve the purpose of \nincreasing functions that municipalities need to perform. Together with a rapid urbanization \ntrend, there is a strong need to develop large-scale geographic information system (GIS)-based \nurban maps. These maps will bring multiple benefits that can be used for better land use \nplanning, project planning, tax information base, and public works engineering purposes.  \n \n9.  Minimum conditions and performance measures. The Ministry of Local Development \n(MLD) and the Secretariat of the Local Body Fiscal Commission, representing the Government, \nissued  the  Manual  for  Assessment  of  Minimum  Conditions  and  Performance  Measures  of \nMunicipalities 2009.8 The performance of municipalities is assessed each year in accordance \nwith the manual, and this forms the basis for determining the amount of grant allocation from the \ncentral Government.9 This is expected to provide incentives to municipalities for performance \n                                                 \n5  Octroi was levied by municipalities as an indirect tax on the transportation of goods from one municipality to \nanother, and abolished in 1999. The charge was 1% on the total value of consumption goods.  \n6  In FY2006, the total revenue of municipalities was only 63.1% of the projected budget. \n7  Accrual-based  accounting  system  was  introduced  in  Kathmandu  metropolitan  city  and  Butwal  and  Dharan \nmunicipalities but is currently in use only in Kathmandu metropolitan city.   \n8  MLD and Secretariat of the Local Body Fiscal Commission. 2009. Manual for Assessment of Minimum Conditions \nand Performance Measures (MC/PM) of Municipalities (Draft). Kathmandu.  \n9  The first performance assessment for 58 municipalities has been conducted and will be finalized in September \n2009. In FY2010, unconditional grant amounting to about NRs340 million will be distributed.    \n ", "  3\nimprovement, and there is a need for hands-on support to municipalities to strengthen their \ncapacity.     \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The expected impact of the TA will be improved quality and sustainability of urban \nservice delivery by municipalities. This will be measured by the improvement in the service \nlevels of urban infrastructure and services provided, and the level of citizens\u2019 satisfaction. The \noutcome of the TA will be strengthened capacity of municipalities for efficient, sustainable, and \naccountable urban service delivery. This will be measured, through a review of the figures of \nparticipating municipalities in FY2010 in comparison to those in FY2008, by (i) an increase in \nthe internal revenue of municipalities,10 (ii) an increase in budget allocated to and spent on \ncapital expenditure and O&M of urban services, (iii) a reduction in misappropriations found in \naudit reports, and (iv) a reduction in the difference between planned revenue and expenditures \nand  actual  figures.  Overall,  the  total  score  of  performance  measures  of  participating \nmunicipalities in FY2010 in accordance with the manual will improve from the FY2008 level.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  Component  1:  Improving  the  financial  management  system.  This component is \nintended to improve the financial management system and increase the internal revenue of \nmunicipalities to ensure the medium- to long-term financial sustainability of urban infrastructure \nand service delivery. The scope will include review of the current financial management system \nof municipalities, including the accounting and audit system. Based on the review, areas for \nimproving  the  financial  management  system,  including  the  potential  for  internal  revenue \nincrease,  will  be  identified  and  a  realistic  annual  revenue  projection  will  be  prepared.  A \ncomprehensive financial management improvement plan (CFMIP) covering 1\u20133 years, including \nrevenue enhancement measures, will also be recommended. After obtaining endorsement from \nthe municipalities concerned, the municipalities will be assisted in implementing the CFMIP, \ntogether  with  staff  capacity  development  programs,  so  that  the  municipalities  can  sustain \nimplementation after TA completion.  \n \n12.  Component  2:  Strengthening  the  technical  capacity  of  staff  for  better  urban \nservice  delivery.  Technical  and  institutional  sustainability  needs  to  be  enhanced  by \nimplementing  capacity  development  programs.  This  component  aims  at  developing  the \ntechnical capacity of relevant officials in municipalities and central government departments in \nrespective subsectors in the fields of overall infrastructure planning, sector planning, project \nmanagement, and effective and efficient O&M for urban service delivery. Capacity development \nprograms will include classroom and on-the-job training, and exposure visits. Resource persons \nmay be invited from abroad. Subsectors to be included will be (i) solid waste management; \n(ii) water  supply  and  sanitation  (including  urban  drainage  and  wastewater  management); \n(iii) urban  transport  (road,  transport  management,  and  regulations);  and  (iv)  overall \ninfrastructure planning. Training participants will prepare a  municipal action plan for better \nplanning, management, or O&M of the respective subsector under the guidance of consultants; \nand start implementing the plan.  \n \n13.  Component 3: Developing and institutionalizing GIS-based urban maps. In this \ncomponent,  a  complete  GIS-based  municipal  information  system  will  be  developed  with \n1:2,500 scale  for  urban  areas  and  1:5,000  scale  for  the  remaining  areas  for  participating \n                                                 \n10 Internal revenue referred to here will not include the local development fee or its substitution allocated by the \nGovernment. \n ", "4   \nmunicipalities.  Information  in  the  maps  will  include  administrative  boundaries,  topographic \nfeatures such as contour lines and land use, transportation infrastructure, utilities infrastructure, \nvarious buildings, and cadastral data. Software customization will be made to link the GIS-\nbased maps with the taxation system of the municipality. Capacity development programs will \nbe undertaken for the municipal staff concerned so that the use of GIS-based urban maps will \nbe institutionalized and optimized for municipal decision-making, including tax mapping and \nrecording, land use planning, and public works engineering.   \n \n14.  Participating  municipalities.  The  TA  will  target  municipalities  where  investment \nprojects are planned with ADB funding\u2014Biratnagar, Birgunj, and Butwal municipalities under \nthe Secondary Towns Integrated Urban Environmental Improvement Project11 and Kathmandu \nmetropolitan  city  under  the  Kathmandu  Sustainable  Urban  Transport  Project12 (these  four \nmunicipalities  are  collectively  referred  to  as  participating  municipalities)  to  maximize \neffectiveness and relevance of the TA for improvement of urban service delivery. Municipalities \nto be supported under the Development of Border Towns Project13 will also be supported in the \nTA to a lesser extent\u2014although resources are focused on participating municipalities, officials \nfrom these municipalities will be invited in capacity development programs.  \n \n15.  Risks. Locally elected mayors and representatives at the Municipal Council have been \nabsent since 2002. Considering the current political instability, such situation may continue. This \nis causing lack of accountability and leadership in improving the performance of functions that \nmunicipalities are supposed to undertake. Furthermore, executive officers acting as mayors of \nmunicipalities, deputed from MLD, are frequently transferred within a short period of time, which \naggravates continued and strong commitment from the leader of the municipality. Though this \nrisk cannot be eliminated, the TA\u2019s links with forthcoming investment projects will help bring \nstrong  municipal  and  public  support  for  improving  the  capacity  and  performance  of \nmunicipalities. Another risk is that the Government is writing a new constitution that could affect \nthe local governance system. However, the TA is in line with the general direction of the \nGovernment  for  strengthening  devolution,  and  the  functions  of  municipalities  are  largely \nexpected to remain.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,050,000 equivalent. The Government has requested ADB \nto finance $900,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The Government will finance the balance of the cost, \nequivalent to $150,000, through the provision of office space, remuneration for counterpart staff \n(including their field per diem and transportation), and other in-kind contributions (Appendix 2).  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Ministry of Physical Planning and Works will be the Executing Agency and will \nappoint a TA coordinator, a first-class officer, with an overall coordinating role. The MLD will \nassign a TA coordinator to coordinate and supervise the work under component 1, while the \nDepartment  of  Urban  Development  and  Building  Construction  (DUDBC)  in  the  Ministry  of \nPhysical Planning and Works will assign a TA coordinator for components 2 and 3. At the \ncentral  level,  a  steering  committee  will  be  established  to  monitor  TA  implementation.  The \nsteering committee will be chaired by the secretary of the Ministry of Physical Planning and \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2008.

The  steering \ncommittee  will  meet  at  least  quarterly  to  discuss  the  overall  progress  and  provide  policy \nguidance to the TA. At each participating municipality, a focal point for the TA is appointed, and \na working committee will be established to work closely with the TA consultants. The working \ncommittee will comprise representatives from sections or subsections on revenue, accounting, \naudit, urban planning, GIS, water and sanitation, transport, solid waste management, and any \nother relevant fields. Regarding components 2 and 3, local offices of technical departments and \ninstitutions will be closely involved.  \n \n18.  The Government will provide (i) all relevant documents, data, statistics, information, and \nmaps  that  are  available  at  the  disposal  of  the  Government;  (ii)  appropriate  and  qualified \ncounterpart staff, including their field per diem and field transportation; (iii) TA coordinators from \nthe Ministry of Physical Planning and Works, the MLD, and the DUDBC, to be assigned before \nthe consultants\u2019 mobilization; (iv) TA focal points and counterpart staff from each participating \nmunicipality, to be assigned before the consultants\u2019 mobilization; (v) office accommodation and \noffice  equipment,  including  desks  and  chairs,  and  local  communication  in  the  DUDBC; \n(vi) logistical assistance for the workshops and seminars, including the venue, and identifying \nand inviting the invitees; and (vii) utility costs, covering electricity and water.  \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months from April 2010 to September 2011. Outline \nterms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. International expertise (10 person-months) \nwill be obtained in the areas of urban planning, urban service delivery (solid waste management \nand urban transport), and financial management. National consultants (60 person-months) will \nhave  expertise  in  the  fields  of  urban  planning,  urban  service  delivery  (water  supply  and \nsanitation, solid waste management, and urban transport), financial management, accounting, \nGIS, and geographic survey. In addition, individual consultants may be engaged to address \nspecific needs of participating municipalities.  \n \n20.  The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). A team of consultants will be recruited \nunder one package using the quality- and cost-based method of selection with a standard \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. A simplified technical proposal will be used for the selection of the \nconsultant firm. The consultants will assist the Government in organizing the workshops at the \nbeginning and toward completion of the TA. The overall framework and approach, objectives, \nand targets of the TA will be shared at the first workshop by inviting relevant government \nagencies and municipalities. The final workshop will be held to disseminate good practices and \nlessons from the TA. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.14 \n \n21.  Some equipment (such as computers, printers, and GIS software) will be procured under \nthe TA using the shopping method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). The Government will ensure proper storage and appropriate use of \nthe equipment and software placed in participating municipalities during TA implementation. \n \n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2008.

Component 1: Improvement of financial management system. Consultants will help \nimprove the financial management system and increase the internal revenue of municipalities to \nensure the medium- to long-term financial sustainability of urban infrastructure and service \ndelivery. The scope of the services will include a review of the current financial management \nsystem of participating municipalities, such as revenue administration management, types of \ntaxes and non-taxes, the status of application of the integrated property tax, collection level and \nefficiency of taxes and non-taxes over the years, assessment methods of tax valuation, staff \ncapacity, and potential for revenue enhancement. The current accounting and audit system, \npractices, and recording status will also be reviewed, including the level of computerization of \nthe accounting system, a plan to reduce backlogs in financial data, adoption of annual financial \nstatements, and internal and external audits of annual financial statements.  \n \n5.  Based on the review, consultants will identify areas for increasing internal revenue and \nprepare a realistic annual revenue projection. Public\u2013private partnership will be addressed as a \nmeasure  to  increase  internal  revenue  as  well  as  improve  service  delivery,  considered  in \nconjunction  with  component  2.  A  comprehensive  financial  management  improvement  plan \n(CFMIP),  covering  1\u20133  years,  including  revenue  enhancement  measures,  will  also  be \nrecommended and fully consulted with participating municipalities. After obtaining endorsement \nfrom the municipalities concerned, the consultants will assist the municipalities in implementing \nthe CFMIP and implement staff capacity development programs so that the municipalities can \nsustain implementation after consultancy services are completed.
