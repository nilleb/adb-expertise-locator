THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Skills and Knowledge for Inclusive Economic Growth \nProject.1 The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction for the Skills and Knowledge for Inclusive Economic Growth \nfor Disadvantaged Communities Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant. \n \n2.  Building  on  lessons  from  the  Skills  Enhancement  Project  financed  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), the proposed project will continue efforts to realign  Viet Nam\u2019s \ntechnical and vocational education and training (TVET) system with current and future labor \nmarket needs.2 The project will upgrade the teaching and learning environments of national high-\nquality TVET institutes with up-to-date technology. These upgrades will enhance the quality of \ntraining programs for advanced skills in close collaboration with business communities. The grant \nwill complement these activities by strengthening the quality of soft skills training and developing \ndemand-driven short-term skills programs for women and youth in disadvantaged communities.3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Background. Viet Nam reached lower middle-income status in 2010. Its economy is one \nof the fastest growing in Southeast Asia, with all sectors growing faster in 2018 than in 2017. In \nthe 3rd quarter of 2018, (i) industry and construction grew by 8.9%, compared with 7.2% in 2017; \n(ii) manufacturing output expanded by 12.7%, similar to 12.8% in 2017, boosted by strong global \nexport demand and continued foreign investment; (iii) services grew by 6.9%, up from 6.4% in \n2017; and (iv) agriculture grew by 3.7%, up from 2.9% in 2017. The labor market structure has \nalso changed from 2006\u20132016. Each year about 1 million workers shift from agriculture to industry \nand services, contributing to increases in overall productivity. About 40% remain engaged in \nagriculture, although the sector\u2019s share of gross domestic product is relatively low at 14%.4 More \nthan half of the labor force is engaged in informal sector activities. Demographic trends suggest \nthat Viet Nam\u2019s labor force will continue to grow by about 1 million people per year until 2020. \n \n4.  Growing competition in global markets and the shift toward a knowledge- and technology-\nbased economy have increased pressure on the government of Viet Nam to improve productivity \nand overall competitiveness. It is continuing to improve transport infrastructure and energy supply \nto strengthen the overall business environment, but business communities consider the lack of \npersonnel with advanced skills to be a major challenge.5 Viet Nam ranks 77th out of 140 countries \non the Global Competitiveness Index.6 Labor productivity in Viet Nam is low compared to that of \nother countries in the region; in 2015, it was 7.5% of Singapore\u2019s, 17% of Malaysia\u2019s, and 36% of \nThailand\u2019s productivity.7 A survey by Viet Nam\u2019s Chamber of Commerce and Industry revealed \n                                                \n1  The project defines knowledge as the theoretical understanding of technical and vocational education and training \n(TVET). Skills refers to applied knowledge and practicum TVET. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). Viet Nam: Skills Enhancement Project; completed in August 2017. \n3  Soft skills refer to non-cognitive skills such as attitude, behavior, communication, problem solving, and teamwork. \n4 General Statistics Office. http://www.gso.gov.vn/Default_en.aspx?tabid=491 (accessed on 20 October 2018). \n5  ADB. 2014.

Geneva. \n7  Asian Productivity Organization. 2017. APO Productivity Databook, 2017. Tokyo. \n \n ", "2 \nthat TVET graduates lack industry-relevant occupational skills and other fundamental soft skills \nsuch as industrial work ethics, teamwork, problem solving, and analytical skills.8 To sustain growth \nand increase competitiveness and productivity, Viet Nam needs to transform low-skilled, labor-\nintensive activities into higher value-added industries by upgrading the skills of its youth. \n \n5.  Development  constraints.  Four  major  development  constraints  impede  the  TVET \nsystem\u2019s ability to produce competent graduates: low-quality training programs and limited labor \nmarket relevance, insufficient training facilities, inequitable access for disadvantaged groups, and \nweak governance and management.9 \n \n6.  Low quality training programs and limited labor market relevance.  Despite the \ngovernment\u2019s ongoing efforts to improve the quality and relevance of Viet Nam\u2019s TVET system, \nbusiness communities remain critical of the skills and overall employability of TVET graduates. \n(footnote 8). TVET institutions are hindered by an imbalance between theory and practical \ntraining, a lack of active enterprise involvement, outdated curricula, and training equipment that \nlacks relevance to industry needs. To improve labor market relevance of TVET graduates, the \nMinistry of Labor\u2013Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) and other ministries   support TVET \ninstitutions to engage with local companies and sector associations to (i) review, revise and \ndevelop occupational standards for training programs; (ii) participate in student assessments and \ncertifications; (iii) establish cooperation agreements for apprentice programs; and (iv) jointly \nproduce goods so that the trainees can gain real industry experience and earn additional income. \nLessons from ADB\u2019s previous project (footnote 2) suggest that some TVET institutions have \nestablished close working relationships with enterprises. Special effort is required to gain more \nindustry support and share successful partnership models with other institutions. Qualified and \ncommitted teachers and managers are the backbone of an efficient and competent TVET system. \nHowever, many of Viet Nam\u2019s 74,000 TVET teachers and more than 10,000 school managers \nlack technical, pedagogical, managerial, and practical industry experience because the minimum \nqualification requirements focus only on academic degrees. Additional effort is needed to review \nqualification requirements, revise pre-service and in-service training, and guide teachers and \nmanagers as the institutions prepare to become autonomous. \n \n7.  Insufficient training facilities. Employers\u2019 assessments of the TVET system emphasize \noutdated and insufficient training facilities as being major constraints for conducting market-\nrelevant training programs (footnote 8). The government\u2019s national budget framework aims to \nallocate 20.0% of total expenditures to education, but only 15.3% was earmarked for education \nin 2015. MOLISA estimates that about 8% of the annual public education budget was allocated \nto TVET. Given that 85%\u201390% of the TVET budget is used for recurrent expenditures, particularly  \nstaff salaries, little is left for upgrading TVET institutions and buying new training equipment. Fast \nchanging technology requires higher competencies and skills from TVET graduates. Access to \nadvanced training equipment is essential to ensure that students receive sufficient hands-on \ntraining. However, the teaching and learning environment in most institutions does not meet \nrequirements for high-quality training. Training equipment is more than 30 years old in most \ncases, and there is insufficient equipment to enable all students to receive hands-on training.10 \nEven relatively well-equipped institutions face challenges in upgrading their programs because of \n                                                \n8  Viet Nam Chamber of Commerce and Industry; and International Labour Organization\u2019s Bureau for Employers\u2019 \nActivities. 2016.

Old training equipment is often defective or cannot be repaired \nfor lack of spare parts. \n \n8.  Inequitable access to technical and vocational education and training for women \nand disadvantaged youth. In 2017, about 2.2 million students were enrolled in Viet Nam\u2019s TVET \ninstitutions. However, there are large gaps in access to TVET, particularly for women, and people \nin rural areas. Females make up about 30% of TVET students (37.8% in urban areas and 24.5% \nin rural areas). Their enrollment is concentrated in limited occupational areas, such as tourism.11 \nThe proportion of the rural population with college, vocational, or technical education degrees is \nhalf that of the urban population. This is despite the government\u2019s commitment to support \nvulnerable  communities  through  stipends  and  other  incentives  aimed  at  increasing  their \nparticipation in TVET programs. The minimum eligibility requirement for admission into formal \nTVET programs is a Grade 9 lower secondary education qualification. Unfortunately, many \ndisadvantaged students are unable to fulfill this minimum requirement. To assist youth without \nformal  education  qualifications  the  government  has  launched  various  nonformal  short-term \ncourses, which are largely subsidized through national targeted programs.12 MOLISA reported \nthat 573,000 rural workers in the northern midlands and mountainous region (Viet Nam\u2019s poorest \nregion) were trained through the national targeted program during 2010\u20132015.13 In 2016, 65.2% \nof the trainees were from ethnic minority groups, 9.0% were from poor households, and 0.6% \nwere persons with disabilities.14 However, the content of short-term skills training needs to \n \nimprove to enable beneficiaries, particularly women, to engage in income-generating activities \nand shift from informal to formal wage employment. \n \n9.  Weak governance and management. MOLISA has been responsible for coordinating \nand promoting TVET since 2017. Its mandate includes policy development, skills standard setting, \naccreditation, and quality control. However, supervision of TVET delivery and quality is complex \nbecause  responsibility  over  TVET  institutions  is  divided  across  13  ministries  and  63  local \ngovernments  that  administer  1,975  TVET  institutions.  MOLISA  directly  manages  only  five \ninstitutions.15 Due to the fragmented structure, comprehensive and consistent information on \nTVET\u2014e.g.,  financing  and  expenditure  data,  tracer  information  on  graduates,  and  details \nregarding infrastructure status\u2014is not readily available. \n \n10.  Government efforts on technical and vocational education and training reform. The \ngovernment enacted the Law on Vocational Education and Training on 24 November 2014.16 The \nlaw presents a strong commitment for comprehensive reforms to increase access to and improve \nthe quality of TVET to meet labor market demands. The government will establish a network of \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2014.

About 900,000 rural workers were trained \nunder this program in 2015, of which about 550,000 benefited from state support. \n13 The region is home to 45 of the country\u2019s 63 poorest districts. In 2015 15% of households were considered poor, \ncompared to 10% nationally. \n14 Government of Viet Nam, MOLISA. 2016.

Government key policies include (i) the Human Resources \nDevelopment Strategy, 2011\u20132020; (ii) the Human Resources Development Master Plan, 2011\u20132020; (iii) the \nVocational Training Development Strategy, 2011\u20132020; and (iv) Party Resolutions No. 29 on Comprehensive \nInnovations of Education and Training (November 2013) and No. 44 on Radical Changes in Education and Training \nfor Industrialization and Modernization (June 2014). \n \n ", "4 \nhigh-quality  TVET  institutes  capable  of  offering  demand-driven  training  at  international \nstandards.17 In 2018, MOLISA proposed a list of 75 TVET institutions for high-quality TVET \ninstitutes network to the Prime Minister. These institutes will be prioritized for future investments \nwith the intent to provide advanced skills training in key priority industries.18 \n \n11.  ADB engagement and development coordination. ADB has been supporting education \nand TVET reform in Viet Nam since 1997. The first TVET project improved the quality assurance \nsystem,  modernized  vocational  training  curricula,  and  upgraded  the  facilities  of  vocational \nsecondary schools.19 The second TVET project upgraded public and private TVET institutions in \n15  occupational  areas  by  increasing  management  capacity,  renovating  facilities,  and \nstrengthening partnerships with the private sector (footnote 2). ADB, the German government, \nand the Japan International Cooperation Agency are the major development partners in the \nsector. Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) supports MOLISA in \nTVET policy formulation and governance and in the development of occupation standards, \ncurricula, and teacher training programs. KfW and the Japan International Cooperation Agency \nsupport selected TVET institutions by upgrading their training equipment and infrastructure. The \nproject builds upon previous ADB financed projects and supports the government\u2019s TVET reforms \nin close coordination with interventions from other development partners. The project also aligns \nwith Strategy 2030 (Table 1).20 \n \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030 Priorities  Project \nAddressing remaining poverty  Improving education and training by (i) increasing access to TVET, especially for \nand reducing inequalities  disadvantaged youth; and (ii) enhancing quality of TVET in selected schools.  \nAccelerating progress in  Pursuing gender equality in human development and promoting women\u2019s \ngender equality  economic empowerment by improving women\u2019s access to TVET, including \nshort-term and college-level training, to enhance their job prospects and \nentrepreneurial skills. \nTVET = technical and vocational education and training. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.   \n \n12.  Lessons. The project was designed in close collaboration with managers and teachers of \nTVET institutions and representatives of local companies. It gained the following lessons from \nprevious interventions: (i) employers and sector associations need to be involved in identifying \ntraining equipment and preparing technical specifications to ensure that there are relevant for \nindustry, (ii) there should be a strong institutional commitment to ensure that training equipment \nis well integrated in the teaching process and used by students, and (iii) sufficient resources \nshould be allocated for the long term operation and maintenance of the equipment. \n \n13.  Value added by ADB assistance. ADB value addition includes (i) providing extensive \ntechnical support for high-quality TVET institutes in linking the training programs with industry and \ndesigning  investment  proposals;  (ii)  identifying  needs  for  skills  and  competencies  in  high \ntechnology industries, which can be supported by future ADB-financed TVET projects; (iii) \ndeveloping advanced models for integrating soft skills into TVET programs; and (iv) introducing \n                                                \n17 MOLISA has developed criteria for high-quality TVET institutes in collaboration with sector associations and other \nministries. These include practical and demand-oriented training programs, close cooperation with enterprises, high \ncompetency of teachers and managers, efficient organizational setup, and sufficient financial capacity. \n18 MOLISA. 2017.

It also \ncomplements the government\u2019s national target program for TVET that focuses on teacher training, \naccreditation, and curriculum development.22 The project addresses the government\u2019s financial \nconstraints by providing the critical additional funding required to upgrade the equipment of TVET \n \ninstitutions and accelerate the establishment of a network of high-quality TVET institutes. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The project is aligned with the following impact: labor productivity and competitiveness of \nthe economy enhanced.23 The project will have the following outcome: selected high-quality TVET \ninstitutes strengthened and aligned to evolving labor market needs.24 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n15.  Output 1: Teaching and learning environments in 16  technical and vocational \neducation and training institutions improved. Output 1 will fund new training equipment in 16 \nTVET institutions. Up-to-date training equipment, including high technology equipment in selected \noccupations, will improve teaching and learning environments and enable TVET institutions to \ndeliver quality training programs in modern occupations required by companies. These TVET \ninstitutions are part of the government\u2019s high-quality TVET institutes network and were selected \nafter extensive assessments. These focused on (i) future training demand by the local private \nsector, (ii) the management and training capacity of the institution, and (iii) investment proposals \nfrom each institution that demonstrate commitments to cover operation and maintenance (O&M) \ncosts and readiness to participate in the project. Six industrial TVET institutions under Ministry of \nIndustry  and  Trade  (MOIT)  have  been  included  as  they  offer  advanced  skills  training  in \noccupations that are considered key priorities for the country\u2019s growth, such as electronics, \nmechanics,  biotechnology,  automation,  and  automotive.  MOLISA  will  complement  the \ninvestments and support institutions through government-funded programs to train teachers and \nmanagers, develop competency standards with business communities, and revise curriculum \nmodels and training programs. \n \n16.  Output 2: Skills training opportunities for disadvantaged communities and soft \nskills of students in selected technical and vocational education and training institutions \nenhanced. Output 2 will have two components. The first component will enhance the capacity of \nselected TVET institutions to deliver short-term training programs to (i) disadvantaged ethnic \nminorities and poor communities, and (ii) people with disabilities. The training programs will be \ndesigned to meet specific demands and build the skills needed to improve income-earning \nopportunities. Component 1 activities include (i) assessing skills demand in selected communities; \n(ii) upgrading or developing short-term training courses for the target groups; and (iii) conducting \n                                                \n21 Mobile app-based training that can easily be accessed by students. \n22 Government of Viet Nam. 2017.

It will (i) set policy directions for the project; (ii) \nprovide technical inputs and coordinate with TVET institutions, the MOIT, and other ministries; \n(iii) report project implementation progress to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Planning and \nInvestment, and ADB; and (iv) establish a project website to disclose project-related information. \nMOLISA\u2019s Directorate of Vocational Education and Training (DVET) and MOIT PMU will be the \nimplementing agencies. The PMU under DVET, which was set up under the previous project, will \ncontinue to implement project activities and facilitate activities for 10 TVET institutions. The PMU \nto be established within MOIT will implement activities for the six remaining TVET institutions. The \nPMUs will facilitate centralized procurement activities under output 1. Each TVET institution will \nbe an implementation partner. A portion of the loan will be relent to TVET institutions on terms \nand conditions satisfactory to ADB. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table \n4 and described in detail in the project administration manual (PAM).25 The detailed mechanisms \nfor procurement are also described in the PAM. The grant will finance output 2 activities, and an \nimplementation consulting firm or institution will be engaged to support the PMU under DVET. \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \n  Arrangements \nAspects  Project Loan  Project Grant \nImplementation period  July 2019\u2013June 2024  July 2019\u2013June 2023 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2024  30 June 2023 \nEstimated closing date  31 December 2024  31 December 2023 \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency  MOLISA will (i) provide policy guidance and overall management of the loan and \ngrant-funded activities; (ii) coordinate with TVET institutions, MOIT, and other \nministries; and (iii) carry out project monitoring and reporting. \n(ii)  Key implementing  DVET under MOLISA and the PMU established in MOIT are the implementing \nagencies  agencies for output 1.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n20.  Assessment of project institutions\u2019 proposals. The proposals from each institution \nincluded information on (i) training capacity and future training demand, (ii) qualification of \nteachers, (iii) tracer information of graduates, (iv) financial capacity, (v) proposed equipment for \npriority occupations based on industry demand, (vi) partnership arrangements with companies, \nand (vii) the local labor market and job opportunities for graduates. To justify investments in new \ntraining equipment, each TVET institution proposed plans for (i) integrating equipment in training \nprograms, and ensuring its use by students; (ii) improving the quality of training programs to meet \nlabor market demands and enhance the employability of graduates; (iii) creating income-earning \nopportunities for institutions; (iv) ensuring the availability of funds for consumables and equipment \nO&M; and (v) preparing teachers to operate the equipment. Representatives from business \ncommunities, MOLISA, MOIT, and ADB reviewed the proposals during project preparation.26 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n21.  Economic benefits. About 75,000 students enrolled in the 16 TVET institutions over the \n5-year implementation period will benefit directly from the improved overall teaching and learning \nenvironment. About 35% of the enrolled students will access new and improved training programs \nusing new equipment. At least 2,500 adults and out-of-school youths are expected to take part in \nshort-term skills training courses that will help them find better-paying jobs or start their own \nbusinesses. About 20% of trainees belong to low-income families. Economic benefits from the \nproject include additional lifetime earnings of new and existing students who receive high-quality \ntraining.  The  project  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  estimates  the  project\u2019s  potential  quantifiable  net \nbenefits total $214.0 million, exceeding the project costs.27 The net enrollment rate of the 16 TVET \ninstitutions is assumed to increase by 10% per year. The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return \nis about 18%, and sensitivity analysis indicated that this rate is sensitive to changes in costs and \nemployability of graduates. \n \n22.  Financial sustainability.  The financial  analysis  confirmed  that the government  has \nadequate financial resources to fulfill all its financial obligations under the project, including O&M \ncosts and service requirements beyond the project implementation period. The selected TVET \ninstitutions can absorb recurrent expenditures such as equipment maintenance costs through \ngovernment budget support, student fees, tailored training for enterprises and individuals, and \nlimited production of goods. Government policies indicate that the TVET budget for recurrent \ncosts will decrease by 2025. This will be concurrent with the partial deregulation of tuition fees, \nwhich may offset the reduced budget support for recurrent expenditures. The 16 TVET institutions \nwill realize efficiency gains through increased enrollment, increased use of equipment, and \nadoption of an entrepreneurial approach to more efficiently manage institutions. \n \n                                                \n26 The list and brief profiles of the 16 TVET institutions is in the PAM. The selection process for output 2 is described \nin Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction Grant (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Net present value at 6% under conservative assumptions that exceed the project costs. \n ", "9 \nC.  Governance \n \n23.  The  financial  management  assessment  rates  the  financial  management  capacity  of \nMOLISA and MOIT as satisfactory but concludes the overall pre-mitigation financial management \nrisk  is  substantial.  MOLISA  and  MOIT  have  agreed  to  implement  a  time-bound  financial \nmanagement action plan to address the deficiencies. The procurement capacity of the PMUs \nunder DVET and MOIT was assessed. The pre-mitigation procurement management risk is \ndeemed to be moderate.28 The project will mitigate risks by (i) recruiting qualified PMU staff, (ii) \nrecruiting financial and procurement consultants to support the PMUs, (iii) developing a financial \nmanagement manual (to improve internal controls), and (iv) training PMU staff. Procurement will \nbe streamlined to promote competition and reduce governance risks associated with several small \npackages.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998, as  amended  to  date) was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government, MOLISA, and MOIT. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 25). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n24.  Under  output  2,  the  project  will  address  the training  needs of  women  and  men  in \ndisadvantaged communities and provide community support programs and short-term training to \nmore  than  200  disadvantaged  communities.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming at entry. A gender action plan will be implemented to make sure that the areas \nselected for short-term training are relevant and of interest to women and different ethnic groups. \nThese areas should also have the potential to provide them with formal jobs and/or a substantive \nincrease in income (beneficiaries of short-term training will be 50% women). Second, girls will be \nencouraged to enroll in regular TVET programs that target highly skilled jobs that are currently \nmale-dominated. To facilitate this, a pilot career education, mentor, and recruitment support \nprogram and promotion campaign will be implemented in five TVET institutions. Finally, specific \nmodules on soft skills that are relevant to gender equality and different ethnic communities will be \nintegrated into the regular curriculum of the selected TVET institutes.29 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n25.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.30 \n(i)  Environment (category C). The project will not support any civil  works. All \nparticipating TVET institutions have dedicated space and management capacity to receive \nand safely operate the training equipment to be supported under the project. \n(ii)  Involuntary resettlement (category C). No new land will be acquired for the \nproject. The proposed activities will be conducted in existing facilities and will not result in \nany involuntary resettlement. \n(iii)  Indigenous peoples (category B). The project expects only positive impacts for \nethnic minority communities. No communal land will be acquired, nor will their natural and \ncultural resources be developed. The targeted TVET institutions are in areas primarily \npopulated by ethnic minority groups.31 Project design under output 2 included ethnic \n                                                \n28 The procurement risk assessment report is in the PAM. \n29 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).
