INTRODUCTION\n1. The Government of Malaysia (the Government) requested the Bank to provide an\nadvisory technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening the Institutional Framework for Sustainable\nDevelopment in September 1994. Subsequently, a Bank Mission visited Malaysia in November\n1994 and held discussions with Government officials. Based on the discussions, the Mission\nconfirmed the need for the TA and reached an understanding with officials concerned about the\nobjectives, scope, and implementation arrangements for the TA.1\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Malaysia's rapid economic growth has brought along with it a complexity of\nenvironmental concerns that need to be addressed in order to ensure the long-term sustainability\nof continued economic and social development. The challenge lies not only in having the\nrequisite technical capability to deal with increasing environmental degradation problems such\nas urban pollution, solid and toxic wastes, contamination of fresh water resources, loss of\nbiodiversity, etc., but, more importantly, in ensuring that the appropriate policies and plans are\nin place to anticipate and deal with these issues so as to minimize adverse environmental effects\nand achieve sustainable development.\n3. The Government is well aware of this and has initiated preparation of strategies and\nplans for sustainable development. For example, (i) a comprehensive National Conservation\nStrategy has been drafted with assistance from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF); (ii) the\nNational Technical Committee on Biological Diversity has prepared a draft National Policy on\nBiological Diversity; (iii) in response to Agenda 21 generated by the United Nations Conference\non Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992, Malaysia submitted\nin January 1994 to the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development a report on the\nprogress towards sustainable development; and (iv) the National Environmental Policy is being\nprepared with participation of nongovernmental organizations.\n4. Appropriate institutional framework needs to be in place to implement strategies and\nplans. At present, the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment (MOSTE) plays a key\nrole in environmental management. MOSTE's Department of Environment monitors\nenvironmental quality, reports on the state of the environment, carries out environmental\neducation and information activities, regulates pollution control, and supervises the environmental\nimpact assessment process. MOSTE's Department of Wildlife and National Parks is in charge\nof preserving the country's flora and fauna. MOSTE's Conservation and Environmental\nManagement Division has an important role in formulating and implementing policies, rules, and\nregulations pertaining to conservation and environmental management, but it has only two\nofficers. The Economic Planning Unit (EPU) of the Prime Minister's Department is chairing the\nsteering committee for implementing Agenda 21 and is in charge of the National Conservation\nStrategy. Sector ministries and their environment-related roles include the following: the Ministry\nof Primary Industries is responsible for the management of forests, the Ministry of Health is\n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in November 1994.", "responsible for environmental sanitation and rural water supply, the Ministry of Agriculture is in\ncharge of data on the quantity and quality of water resources, the Ministry of Human Resources\ndeals with occupational safety and health, and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry\nchairs the National Council of Hazardous Chemicals although it has only two environment staff.\nThese institutions seem to have some overlapping environment-related roles, and some\ninstitutions' capacity to deal with environmental issues may not allow them to discharge\nsatisfactorily the roles they have assumed.\n5. These institutions were set up during the 1970s when the emphasis was on cleaning\nup, rather than preventing, pollution. The primary consideration then was for a regulatory and\nenforcement capability. Since then, the emphasis has changed to an integrated and preventive\napproach through policy coordination and the increased use of market mechanisms in\nenvironmental management. However, there has been no noticeable shift in development of\ninstitutions, methods of coping with the new strategies in environmental management.\n6. Further, the World Bank discussion paper entitled \"Toward an Environmental\nStrategy for Asia\" has identified the need for strengthening public institutions as one of the key\nmeasures to be undertaken by rapidly developing economies. The Report notes that \"Weak\ninstitutions typically lack both the technical skills and political authority to change the behavior\nof firms, households, and farmers. Weak enforcement agencies often lack both the information\n(such as emission data) and the means (such as consistent and fair enforcement capabilities)\nto implement policy.\"\n7. In addition, the relationship in environmental fields between the Federal Government\nand the states may need streamlining and consolidation. For example, the Department of\nEnvironment (DOE) has offices in ten states, including Sabah and Sarawak, and Sabah and\nSarawak have their own ministries in charge of environmental issues. However, MOSTE's\nDepartment of Wildlife and National Parks covers only Peninsular Malaysia, while Sabah and\nSarawak have ministries in charge of wildlife and national parks. Most natural resources are\nwithin the constitutional control of the states, and the Federal Government assumes the primary\npolicy making role. Overlapping and split responsibilities need to be addressed.\n8. Thus, the current institutional framework for environmental initiatives should be\nstudied, and reorganized and strengthened as necessary so that strategies and plans for\nsustainable development will be fully and property implemented.\n9. The preparation of the Seventh Malaysia Plan (1996-2000) will start soon, and\noutput of the TA is expected to be incorporated in the Plan.\n10. As Bank lending is increasingly focused on cross-cutting issues such as\nenvironment and poverty reduction, the Bank's involvement in strengthening the institutional\nframework for sustainable development will provide the Bank with an opportunity to contribute\nto policy dialogue in an increasingly important area of debate in Malaysia.", "3\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n11. The TA will assess the appropriateness of current institutional mechanisms relating\nto environment and development in Malaysia, and will propose suitable institutional framework\nalternatives for implementing sustainable development initiatives in Malaysia.\nB. Scope\n12. The TA will (i) review the existing institutions undertaking environmental initiatives,\n(ii) prepare alternate institutional frameworks with detailed responsibilities of each institution in\ntheir environmental activities, (iii) recommend ways of capacity building for the institutions, and\n(iv) coordinate with preparatory activities for the Seventh Malaysia Plan. The detailed terms of\nreference for the consultant are given in Appendix 1.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n13. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $173,000 equivalent, including $87,000 in\nforeign exchange and $86,000 in local currency equivalent (see Appendix 2). The Government\ncontribution is estimated at $31 ,000 equivalent. The Bank will finance the total foreign exchange\ncost of $87,000 and part of the local currency cost equivalent to $55,000. Thus, $142,000 will\nbe provided by the Bank on a grant basis.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n14. EPU, through its Regional Economics Section, will be the Executing Agency for the\nTA. EPU chairs the interdepartmental committee consisting of Government institutions relating\nto sustainable development, including MOSTE, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry,\nthe Ministry of Primary Industries, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry\nof Human Resources, and the Ministry of Housing and Local Governments. The committee will\nprovide the consultant with information about strategies and plans for sustainable development\nin Malaysia and current institutional mechanisms relating to environment and development.\n15. The TA will require the services of one internationally recruited consultant for three\nperson-months starting April 1995. Provision is also made to engage local consultants to\nproduce commissioned reports in specific subject areas such as air pollution, water pollution,\nsoil contamination, chemicals management, nature conservation, environmental economics,\nenvironmental institutions, environmental education, and environmental research. The consultant\nwill be recruited by the Bank in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants. The TA will also provide for a notebook computer with a printer, a technical\nassistant, and administrative support for the duration of the TA. The equipment will be procured\nby the consultant in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement, and will be retained\nby EPU on completion of the TA.\n16. EPU will provide about three person-months of counterpart professional staff to\ncooperate with and assist the consultant in carrying out the TA, and will provide adequate office\nspace and basic equipment.", "4\n17. The consultant will be required to submit to the Government and the Bank an\ninception report, draft final report, and final report. Twenty-five copies of each report will be\nrequired: 5 copies will be sent to the Bank and 20 copies to EPU.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n18. The President, acting under the authority delegated to him by the Board, has\napproved the provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of Malaysia\nin an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $142,000 for the purposes of Strengthening the\nInstitutional Framework for Sustainable Development, and hereby reports his action to the\nBoard.", "5\nAppendix 1\nPage 1\nTERMS OF REFERENCE\nThe international consultant will\n(i) review strategies and plans for sustainable development in Malaysia;\n(ii) review and analyze the existing institutions undertaking environmental\ninitiatives, focusing on Federal Government Ministries and State\nGovernments;\n(iii) review and analyze the institutional frameworks relating to environment and\ndevelopment in other countries;\n(iv) commission discussion papers on specific topics to local consultants (the\ninternational consultant will select the local consultants and will report to the\nBank regarding selection proposed and the contracting terms; the topics will\ninclude the roles of Federal Government, state governments, universities, and\nother institutions in air pollution control, water pollution control, soil\ncontamination management, chemicals management, nature conservation,\nenvironmental economics, environmental education, and environmental\nresearch);\n(v) identify the weakness of the existing institutional framework in implementing\nthe strategies and plans for sustainable development;\n(vi) provide the interdepartmental committee with an appropriate draft\ninstitutional framework for sustainable development, which will be readily\nimplementable, together with detailed responsibilities of each institution in\ntheir environmental activities (emphasis should be given to streamlining and\nstrengthening existing institutions);\n(vii) identify the funds and human resources needed to realize the proposed\ninstitutional framework;\n(viii) recommend the ways of capacity building for each institution under the\nproposed institutional framework;\n(ix) provide the committee with draft ideal institutional framework for sustainable\ndevelopment that will be a long-term target, together with detailed\nresponsibility of each institution in their environmental activities; and\n(Reference in text: page 3, para. 12)", "6\nAppendix 1\nPage 2\n(x)\t submit the following reports to the Government and the Bank:\n(a) inception report: to be submitted two weeks after the commencement\nof the TA;\n(b) draft final report: to be submitted one month prior to the termination\nof consulting services; and\n(C)\t final report: to be submitted within two weeks after receiving\nGovernment and Bank comments on the draft final report.", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n7\nAppendix 2\nSUMMARY OF COST ESTIMATES\n($'OOO)\nItem\t Foreign\t Local\t Total\nExchange Currency\nA.
