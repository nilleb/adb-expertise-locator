INTRODUCTION\n1. In  recognition  of  the  importance  of  good  governance  for  sustained  economic\ndevelopment in Asia, in October 1995 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) adopted a policy on\ngovernance  that  identified  four  means  to  sustained  economic  development:  accountability,\nparticipation, predictability, and transparency.1 The adoption of this policy marked a key step by\nADB toward the goal of becoming a broad-based development institution. In November 1999,\ngovernance was identified as one of the three pillars of ADB\u2019s new poverty reduction strategy.2\n2. The poverty reduction strategy acknowledges that the poor are not a homogenous\ngroup. Just as the nature of poverty is diverse, so too are its causes and victims. The poor may\nnot have acquired essential assets because they belong to an ethnic minority or a community\nconsidered socially inferior, are female, or are disabled. At a broader level, poverty may stem\nfrom  situations  where  gross  inequality  of  assets  persists  because  of  vested  interests  and\nentrenched power structures. Essential assets may not be available to the poor because of the\nlack  of  political  will,  or  inappropriate  public  policies  and  programs.  Poor  governance  can\ntherefore, cause or inhibit the resolution of many of the various facets of poverty (including the\nproblems of (i) lack of access and/or poor delivery of social services to some segments of\nsociety, and (ii) ineffective interventions for people with the potential to move out of poverty\nthrough self-help).\n3. In the context of reviewing the implementation of its policy on governance in 2000, ADB\nelaborated its medium-term agenda and action plan for governance for 2000-2004.3 The action\nplan calls for ADB to take specific actions to raise governance to the top level of its development\nagenda, and make clear to its developing member countries (DMCs) that good governance is\nan important element for enhancing the impact of development assistance. The action plan also\ncalls for ADB to elaborate the links between good governance and poverty reduction, and good\ngovernance and political and institutional frameworks, and to ensure that the linkages are\nrecognized in project designs and in promotional material prepared by ADB.\n4. The concept of this regional technical assistance (TA) was approved by ADB\u2019s RETA\nScreening Committee in June 2000.4 Appendix 1 provides the logical framework for the TA.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n5. The links between good governance and poverty reduction efforts have been elaborated\nat the general and conceptual level in the context of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy.5 Various\ninternational institutions have also studied these channels of impact. Appendix 2 describes\nsome  of  the  known  channels  of  economywide  impact  from  good  governance  to  poverty\nreduction. However, the studies have been confined to the impact of governance within the core\ngovernment  activities,  and  its  general  impact  on  poverty  at  the  economywide  level,  while\nsectoral issues have not been covered in any systematic manner.\n6. Most ADB lending and TA activities have traditionally included policy recommendations\nto reform and improve the policy environment within the sector in which ADB activities take\nplace. Many of the projects implemented by other agencies and the governments of DMCs do\n                                                \n1  R151-95:  Governance: Sound Development Management, 17 August 1995.\n2  R179-99:  Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific, the Poverty Reduction Strategy of the ADB, 9 November 1999.\n3  Working Paper 4-00, Promoting Good Governance: ADB\u2019s Medium-Term Agenda and Action Plan, March 2000.\n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Version) on 3 July 2000.\n5  R-179-99.", "2\nthe  same.  The  policy  recommendations  at  times  include  those  aimed  at  improving  the\ngovernance  environment  in  the  sector.  For  projects  aimed  at  poverty  reduction,  policy\nrecommendations to improve governance should also contribute to poverty reduction. However,\nthis practical connection has not been systematically studied.\n7. Examples of forms of sectoral governance reform activities include,\n(i)  enhancing  the  accountability,  transparency,  financial  management,  and\nparticipatory aspects of the executing agencies involved in ADB projects;\n(ii)  improving management (including financial) aspects of state-owned utilities to\nbring them closer to privatization;\n(iii)  improving financial and managerial aspects of the school, health, and urban\ndevelopment  systems  in  various  regions  of  a  country  and  introducing\nmechanisms  to  maximize  private  sector  entrepreneurship  in  their  delivery  of\nservices;\n(iv)  restructuring state-level housing institutions (state housing boards) to provide\nbetter subsidized housing; and\n(v)  involving  and  encouraging  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure\ndevelopment and maintenance through mechanisms to increase their capacity\nand  enhance  accountability  and  transparency  mechanisms  within  the  private\nsector.\n8. Experience and conjecture have shed some light on possible channels of impact in this\nrelationship. For example, improved governance within sectors can contribute to the reduction\nof poverty through\n(i)  reduced  costs  of  doing  business  in  the  sectors  and  thus  enhanced  flow  of\ninvestment  and  enhancing  the  efficiency  with  which  capital  is  used  in  each\nsector;\n(ii)  better provision of infrastructure services, thus leading to lower production costs\nfor firms operating in some sectors, e.g., relatively cheaper transport costs;\n(iii)  improved incentives systems that result in better delivery of services, including\nsocial services, and hence in higher human capital that could be used as factors\nof production in sectors; and\n(iv)  contribution, through the anticorruption impact of good governance, to better\neconomic  development,  increased  economic  growth,  and  more  equitable\ndistribution of the gains from economic growth, all of which benefit sectors that\nare capital intensive (e.g., infrastructure).\n9. Therefore,  the  more  exact  channels  of  impact  of  governance  on  poverty  reduction\nshould now be ascertained at sectoral (rather than economywide) levels through review and\nevaluation of the policy recommendations (para. 8). The TA is intended as a step in this\ndirection.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n10. The overall goal of the TA is to improve the information base on the linkages between\ngovernance  improvement  and  effective  poverty  reduction  interventions  within  sectors.  The\nobjectives of the TA are to:", "3\n(i)  identify the practical contribution of policy recommendations on governance to\npoverty reduction in externally funded projects, including those of ADB, in various\nsectors;\n(ii)  identify factors (political, social, economic, or those related to economywide and\nintersectoral aspects of governance) that hamper efforts at poverty reduction\nthrough bad sectoral governance;\n(iii)  study possibilities of enhancing the impact of governance reforms within sectors;\nand\n(iv)  help use lessons learned by disseminating the findings of the study to ADB staff\nand DMC officials.\n11. The TA will attempt to gain the understandings on lessons to be learned by evaluating a\nnumber  of  projects,  by  focusing  on  the  impacts  of  the  implementation  of  the  associated\ngovernance-related policy recommendations. Knowledge gained through this study will be used\nto improve design and implementation of ADB projects.\nB.  Scope\n12. The TA will cover select projects that meet the selection criteria (specified in paragraph\n15 below) within at most three DMCs. To ensure that a variety of issues of governance are\ncovered, the sectors are selected to represent different backgrounds for governance issues.\nThe sectors are social sector, infrastructure, and finance. At least three, and at most six projects\nwill be selected for study in each sector. The DMCs to be included in the RETA will be\ndetermined based on the location of the projects that would be selected for the study. The\nprojects  will  be  selected  from  those  implemented  by  ADB,  or  other  agencies,  or  the\nGovernment.  The  willingness  of  the  DMCs  within  which  the  selected  projects  have  been\nimplemented, and the concurrence of other agencies to have their projects included in the\nstudy, will be obtained during the inception mission.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n13. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent. This will cover costs of\nconsulting services, seminars, travel, and publication. Of the total cost, $40,000 equivalent will\nbe in local currencies, representing remuneration and per diem for domestic consultants, local\ntravel, and some components of the in-country seminars. The remaining $560,000 will be in\nforeign exchange. Details of the cost estimates are given in Appendix 3. The TA will be financed\nby ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, financed by the Government of Japan.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n14. The implementation of the RETA will begin with staff discussions at the headquarters to\ndetermine a longlist of projects that would be potential candidates for inclusion in the study.\nBased on detailed review of background documents and other available information, this long\nlist will then be reduced to a shortlist.  At this stage, the concurrence of the DMCs in which the\nshortlisted projects are located will be obtained.  An inception mission will then take place to\nbegin the process of further discussions with stakeholders within the DMCs, make contact with", "4\nother donors in the field, and identify possible projects implemented by other donors or the\ngovernment, for inclusion in the study.\n15. The criteria for selecting the projects are as follows:\n(i)  Each project must have poverty reduction as its primary or secondary objective.\nProjects  approved  before  this  classification  was  used,  and  other  agencies\u2019\nprojects, will be evaluated to ascertain that they meet present ADB criteria for\nclassification as a poverty reduction project.\n(ii)  Investment projects, program loans, and TA operations will be considered before\nselection is made. All selected activities will have a substantial policy reform\ncomponent.\n(iii)  The nature of at least some of the policy reforms should be highly focused on\ngovernance issues within the sector.\n(iv)  More than one project may be considered per sector per country, depending on\navailability of appropriate projects.\n(v)  Projects in the same sector will be as similar as possible so that the impact of\ncountrywide  issues  affecting  sectoral  governance  can  be  identified  through\ncomparative study, and be kept separate from sector-specific issues.\n(vi)  An attempt will be made to select at least one project per sector that has already\nbeen completed and has results amenable for evaluation.\n(vii)  Each project will have clearly defined monitoring mechanisms and indicators of\nprogress in poverty reduction established at the start of implementation. If not,\nthe TA should be able to establish such indicators retroactively.\n(viii)  Projects  selected  could  be  from  those  implemented  by  ADB,  other  funding\nagencies, or the DMC government.\n16. The study of each project will be conducted with the assistance of ADB\u2019s Operations\nEvaluation Office (OEO), using a broader set of information that is normally taken into account\nin its internal evaluation of ADB projects. Particular attention will be devoted to (i) the role of\nexpected and actual noneconomic factors that may have influenced the performance of a\nproject, (ii) countrywide and intersectoral linkages regarding governance issues, and (iii) efforts\nmade, and the resultant impact of capacity building before and during project implementation, to\nevaluate their influence on the success of the project.\n17. The immediate and deliverable outputs of the TA will be three basic studies using\nresearch, information available within ADB, and missions. The findings will be presented in\nthree volumes on governance and poverty issues, one for each of the three sectors. The issues\nof sectoral governance that will be addressed will include, but not be limited to:\n(i)  issues involved in the public-private interface and their implications for good\ngovernance;", "5\n(ii)  issues  of  public  expenditure  management  in  sectors,  including  coordination\nbetween planning ministries (e.g., ministry of finance) and sector ministries;\n(iii)  strategies for identifying and moving toward an optimal degree of stakeholders\u2019\nparticipation in sector development programs; and\n(iv)  possibilities for agency restructuring, asset management, and strengthening of\nthe  management  capacity  and  effectiveness  of  regulatory  authorities  in  the\nsectors with the intention to improve governance.\n18. The three studies will be used for conducting three seminars at ADB and six seminars in\nthe participating DMCs. Therefore, the outputs of the TA will expand beyond these immediate\nstudies and result in identifying codes of good practices in governance, ranking or categorizing\nvarious aspects of governance from the point of view of poverty reduction, and encouraging\nbetter project designs and implementation arrangements.\n19. The methodology and outline terms of reference for the TA are given in Appendix 4.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n20. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$600,000 for the purpose of the Study of the Interlinkages Between Governance and Poverty in\nSectoral Development and Reform Activities, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "6\nAppendix 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Performance Targets Monitoring Assumptions\nSummary Mechanisms and Risks\nGoal\nThe  overall  goal  of  the  technical Output of the study, Missions and Continued\nassistance  (TA)  is  to  improve  the seminars should help reports of the commitment of\ninformation  base  on  the  linkages improve policy design and consultants developing\nbetween governance improvement and implementation in sectoral member\neffective poverty reduction interventions projects and programs to Progress reports of countries\nwithin sectors. increase impact of good those implementing (DMCs)\ngovernance on poverty the TA involved to good\nreduction. governance and\npoverty\nreduction\nObjectives\n1.

The quality of governance at the central and local level, and governance relations in\nadministration and society, are often crucial to efforts to reduce poverty. Good governance for\npoverty  reduction  relates,  among  others  things,  to  (i)  focusing  resources  on  antipoverty\ninitiatives and ensuring accountability in the use of public funds; (ii) building national capacities\nfor pro-poor policy formulation and implementation; (iii) improving administration and private\nsector participation for better delivery of services to the poor; (iv) shifting decision making nearer\nto the poor and helping them organize themselves; (v) preventing corruption, as this affects the\npoor more than other segments of society; (vi) strengthening the rule of law through pro-poor\ndissemination of laws, empowerment through legal literacy, and ready access to effective and\ninexpensive enforcement procedures; and (vii) involving, in a participatory way, a diversified\nrange of stakeholders, including nongovernment organizations (NGOs) that represent the poor.\nThese relations are in need of more detailed study.\n2. The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  implemented  a  substantial  number  of\nprograms and technical assistance projects at the core of the government in its developing\nmember countries (DMCs) to improve aspects of public sector governance. These include the\nreform of public administration, public expenditure management, strengthening and reform of\nthe legal systems, anticorruption initiatives, rule of law and legal reforms, and decentralization\nefforts.\n3. There are numerous channels of impact from these types of public sector governance to\npoverty  reduction.  For  example,  increased  accountability  through  anticorruption  efforts,\ncontributes to poverty reduction when it results in (i) reduced loss in budgetary allocations\nslotted  for  poverty  reduction  and  social  sectors,  (ii)  management  reforms  in  state-owned\nenterprises (SOEs), and (iii) legal system reforms that encourage laws granting citizens the right\nto challenge administrative actions before an ombudsman or the courts. It also helps to hold\npublic decision makers accountable for (i) avoiding nonproductive uses of the taxpayers\u2019 money,\nand (ii) improving the procurement procedures of the public sector entities. All these impacts\nwork to increase the resources available for poverty reduction efforts.\n4. In the same vein, the direct impacts on poverty of increased predictability due to a\nstrengthening of the rule of law may come through the same channels, which, among other\nthings, reduce (i) losses of budgetary allocations, (ii) demand for bribes by managers of state\nowned enterprises, and (iii) favoritism in public decisions. All such reductions disproportionately\nbenefit the poor and therefore have an impact on poverty reduction efforts and public service\ndelivery in the social sectors.\n5. Lack of transparency in public sector operations is manifest in ways in which scarce\npublic resources are allocated and policies are formulated. In countries where institutions are\nweak, transparency in policymaking and resource allocation becomes a threat to public officials.\nIn such environments, public decisions will generally favor recipients who are well connected to\ncenters of power. The result is that services valued by the elite receive disproportionate funding\n(for example, specialized medicine, rather than primary health care, tertiary rather than primary\neducation; and capital intensive rather than labor intensive infrastructure), and policies are\nadopted  that  benefit  a  few  (for  example,  the  granting  of  monopoly  privileges).  Increased\ntransparency makes it more difficult to conceal decisions that are systematically biased against\nthe poor.\n(Reference in text: page 1, para. 5)", "8\nAppendix 2, page 2\n6. Participatory  mechanisms  envisaged  as  part  of  good  governance  help  to  make\ngovernments responsive to the needs of the poor by increasing public debate and supervision\non issues affecting the poor, such as distributional equality. Political instability and/or frequent\nchanges in the government create uncertainties about state policies, public sector priorities, and\nthe  best  use  of  national  resources.  Such  uncertainties  are  greater  among  the  poor  and\nuneducated segments of the society than other groups, partly because the poor are often not\npolitically involved in or educated about the available policy choices. In such environments, pro-\npoor nongovernment organizations (NGOs) can help maintain public interest in these issues.\n7.  The World Bank\u2019s World Development Report, 2000, Chapter 3, and the joint ADB/World\nBank volume on \u201cThe New Social Policy Agenda In Asia:  Proceedings of the Manila Social\nForum\u201d, August 2000, Chapter 7, are good sources of information on studies done in this area.\nAdditional research include M.

Scope\n1. The study will\n(i)  identify and evaluate (based on known practices in governance reforms) the\npolicy recommendations that have an impact on the governance environment\nwithin  the  sector  involved,  (a)  discussing  their  likely  original  objective;  (b)\ndiscussing where they are in reaching those objectives; (c) discussing why taking\nnational, sectoral, intersectoral, and other factors into account; and (d) indicating\nhow the same objective would be sought today; and\n(ii)  discussing possible poverty implications of the original and the modified designs.\n2. The following are not within the mandate of the study: (i) evaluating the sustainability\nand long term effectiveness of governance reforms, (ii) measuring effective governance, and (iii)\nusing indicators of poverty to gauge impact.\nB. Implementation Arrangements\n3. About 14 person-months of international and 15 person-months of domestic consulting\ninputs will be required for the technical assistance (TA). The consultants will be engaged on an\nindividual  basis.  The  in-country  seminars  will  be  organized  by  the  consultants  under\narrangements satisfactory to the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\n4. Implementation of the RETA will begin at ADB headquarters by means of discussions\nwith various programs officers and project departments to identify a long list of projects in\nvarious developing member countries (DMCs) that could potentially be suitable for this study.\nThe  international  consultants  will  then  study  further  the  available  documentation  on  these\nprojects with the objective to reduce this list to a shortlist focusing on, at most, three DMCs.\nThose DMCs will then be contacted and their concurrence to be included in the RETA will be\nsought.\n5. Aided by the international and local consultants, staff missions (including the inception\nmission) will discuss with the DMC officials the implementation of the projects selected for the\nstudy. The objective of these discussions is to learn about overall environment within which the\nprojects were implemented and to identify the areas of information needed to be collected on\nthese projects. Information and data relating to the selected projects and the environment within\nwhich they were implemented will be collected to the extent possible during the missions. Efforts\nwill be made during the inception mission to enlist other agencies\u2019 participation and ascertain\ntheir willingness to allow their projects to become part of the study.\n6. The final report of the consultants will include separate chapters on each sector study.\nProject studies in each sector will determine (i) the original ambitions of the project in terms of\noutcomes; (ii) what was expected to lead to achievement of the expected outcomes; (iii) the\nfactors identified during project implementation as contributing to its success or failure; (iv) what\nfactors  that  were  outside  the  risks  and  assumptions  identified  at  the  beginning  of  the\nimplementation process, but that were at work; (v) how these factors came into play, and how\nthey interacted with original assumptions and identified risks.\n(Reference in text: page 5, para. 19)", "11\nAppendix 4, page 2\n7.
