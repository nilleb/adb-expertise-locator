INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)1 Transport  and  Trade \nFacilitation Strategy 2020 outlines the need for region-wide improvements in road safety, noting \nthat it is economically and socially beneficial to invest in improving safety of the region\u2019s roads.2 \nThe strategy envisages that support will be provided for road safety management capacity, safe \napproaches to the design, construction, operation and maintenance of road infrastructure, and \nmobilization of resources for road safety measures. The strategy calls for a regional road safety \nstrategy to be developed, integration of safety into the design of each CAREC road project, and \nincreased  network  sustainability  through  safety  efforts  and  both  stand-alone  projects  and \nregional technical assistance (TA) programs, focused on road safety.3  \n \n2.  The TA addresses road safety in CAREC member countries. It links with the country \npartnership strategies of several CAREC member countries, which identify road safety as a key \nchallenge. The TA was presented at a meeting of the CAREC Transport Sector Coordinating \nCommittee (TSCC) in Bishkek on 14\u201315 May 2014, and all the country delegations confirmed \nthe need for concerted region-wide action on road safety and supported the TA. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  An estimated 1.2 million\u20131.3 million people are killed, and up to 50 million injured, on the \nworld\u2019s roads every year. Without decisive intervention, the annual fatality toll is forecast to \nincrease to more than 1.8 million by 2020.4 In response to this growing problem, the United \nNations (UN) General Assembly identified road safety as an urgent global health issue. The UN \nsecretary general called upon all UN agencies and development institutions, including ADB, to \nassist the UN member countries in addressing this urgent and growing problem. The need for a \nglobal plan to provide a template of the sorts of activities that all countries should endeavor to \ncarry out to improve road safety was agreed. Following this, the Decade of Action for Road \nSafety commenced in May 2011. The Decade of Action identified five pillars or activities: road \nsafety management, safer roads and mobility, safer vehicles, safer road users, and post-crash \nresponse. By encouraging action on all of these pillars, it is hoped that the Decade of Action will \nresult in 5 million fewer road collision fatalities.5 The UN has mandated the World Health \nOrganization (WHO) to take responsibility for road safety as an urgent health problem and to \ncoordinate global efforts to reduce road deaths and injuries. \n \n4.  Over 90% of the world\u2019s fatalities on the road occur in low- and middle-income countries, \nwhich have only 48% of the world\u2019s registered vehicles. Low- and middle-income countries have \nhigher road traffic fatality rates (21.5 per 100,000 population for low-income countries and \n19.5 per 100,000 population for middle-income countries) than high-income countries (10.3 per \n100,000 population). Traffic fatality rates in CAREC member countries range from 13.1 to \n21.9 per 100,000 population.6 Vehicle ownership rates in CAREC member countries are low but \n                                                 \n1  CAREC member countries are Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Kazakhstan, the \nKyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. \n2  ADB. 2014.

In the absence of concerted action on road safety, the toll of \nfatalities and injuries in the region is likely to increase markedly over the coming decades. \n \n5.  Road crashes are a recognized problem and CAREC member countries have been \nattempting to contribute to the UN Decade of Action goals. Several CAREC member countries \nhave adopted national road safety strategies (e.g., Azerbaijan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nKazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan). However, not all of these are fully funded \nand road safety activities are generally under-resourced. There is a need to coordinate road \nsafety activities across the CAREC region and to ensure that an adequate level of safety is \nprovided on designated CAREC corridors.  \n \n6.  In most CAREC member countries, strong, albeit varied, laws and policies regulate \ndrunk driving, seatbelt wearing, helmet use, and use of mobile phones while driving\u2014with levels \nof police enforcement varying widely. Additional resources are needed to reach the UN Decade \nof Action goals. \n \n7.  Knowledge transfer plays a key role in empowering CAREC member countries to adopt \nvarious road safety initiatives, and demand for ad hoc TA projects relating to road safety has \nincreased. For example, ADB has assisted Kazakhstan to develop a methodology for evaluation \nof economic costs of road traffic collisions in order to enable cost-efficient investments and \nbetter-informed policy decisions on road safety to be made.7 There is a growing need to provide \nroad safety knowledge and training products to CAREC member countries to ensure that they \nincorporate international best practices into  the design, construction and operation of their \nrespective road networks.  \n \n8.  The burden of road collisions falls disproportionately on the poor, with more than half of \nall  road  casualties  in  the  vulnerable  road  user  category,  i.e.,  pedestrians,  cyclists,  or \nmotorcyclists. Two-thirds of victims\u2019 families need to take loans to cover lost income, and many \nfamilies are driven into poverty or indebtedness as a result of road collision-related fatalities or \ninjuries.8 \n \n9.  Road  collisions  are,  however,  preventable.  Proper  road  safety  management  and \ncoordination, improved data collection and research, engineering, enforcement, and education \ninitiatives, as well as post-crash care, can all contribute to reducing the number and severity of \nroad collisions.  \n \n10.  Given that many of the issues noted above\u2014to be addressed as part of this TA\u2014are \ncommon to all CAREC member countries, it is more efficient for one TA to be carried out at \nregional (CAREC-wide) level. This TA will seek to maximize use of information and materials \nproduced as part of previous road safety TA projects, particularly Improving Road Safety in the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations.9 This TA will also draw on lessons learned from a \nsimilar ADB TA project by encouraging government ownership from the outset and seeking \ninvolvement from civil society and other stakeholders, including the WHO.10 The TA will also \nseek to ensure sustainability of project outputs and outcomes by embedding a road safety \nculture into CAREC member countries and by creating a critical mass of road safety expertise \nthat can continue operating long after the completion of the TA. \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2014.

The TA will form part of ADB\u2019s contribution toward the UN Decade of Action goals. It is in \nline  with  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020.11 The  TA  is  also  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nSustainable Transport Initiative, which indicated that ADB will \u201cdevelop comprehensive road \nsafety operations\u201d in selected developing member countries including \u201csupport[ing] engineering \nand behavioral approaches to the safe design, construction, operation and maintenance of road \ninfrastructure\u2026and  the  development  of  road  safety  management  capacity,  road  safety \nperformance measurement and resource mobilization.\u201d12 \n \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The  impact  will  be  improvements  in  road  safety  performance  in  CAREC  member \ncountries. The outcome will be strengthened capacity of CAREC governments to identify and \naddress key road safety issues in their respective countries. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The outputs of the TA will be (i) CAREC road safety strategy published; (ii) strengthened \ncapacity  of  CAREC  member  countries  to  manage  and  coordinate  road  safety  activities, \nincluding  improved  data  collection  and  road  collision  research,  improved  engineering, \neducation, and enforcement capacity; and (iii) integration of road safety evaluation tools into \nCAREC road projects. \n \n14.  To achieve these outputs, the following key activities will be undertaken: \n \n(i)  The road safety performance of CAREC member countries will be reviewed and \na draft road safety strategy will be compiled and presented to the CAREC TSCC. \nThe CAREC road safety strategy will be finalized based on comments received. \nIt will include an action plan outlining steps to be taken to improve road safety in \nCAREC member countries. \n(ii)  The ability of CAREC member countries to identify key road safety issues and, in \na  targeted  manner,  develop  and  implement  solutions  and  monitor  their \nimplementation will be enhanced. As a first step, the TA will review (a) existing \ncollision reporting and road safety data collection systems, (b) competencies in \nroad safety engineering, (c) levels of police enforcement of traffic laws, and \n(d) practices regarding road safety education. \n(iii)  Drawing  on  the  work  of  similar  ADB  TA  projects,  a  series  of  best  practice \nmanuals and training materials will be adapted or produced, covering (a) road \nsafety  data  systems  and  research,  (b) road  safety  engineering,  and  (c) \nenforcement of traffic laws (footnote 9). Comprehensive train-the-trainer courses \nwill be held for each of these areas. This will be followed up by national courses \nin at least three CAREC member countries, disseminating best practice. \n(iv)  Guidelines on incorporating good practice in road safety in the design of future \nCAREC road projects will be produced. These guidelines will include a series of \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2014.

In developing \nknowledge products, care will be taken to build on, and avoid duplication of, \nexisting  guidelines  produced  by  agencies  such  as  the  Global  Road  Safety \nPartnership, the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, \nWHO, the World Road Association, the World Bank, and ADB. \n \n15.  Risks  and  assumptions  have  been  identified  as  part  of  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework for this TA. The main risks are (i) failure of governments to adopt road safety policies \nand strategies or to report progress toward road safety targets; and (ii) lack of commitment to \nroad safety from police forces, combined with failure of the public to report road collisions, leads \nto poor availability and/or quality of collision data. The main assumptions are (i) governments \nproactively take effort to reduce road casualties and provide adequate funding for road safety \nactivities, and (ii) CAREC member countries send appropriate personnel to arranged activities. \n \n16.  Activities will be coordinated with relevant international development agencies, agencies \nin CAREC member countries, civil society and other stakeholders to avoid overlapping and to \nmaximize the effectiveness of the project. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V).  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA,  with  ADB\u2019s  Central  and  West  Asia \nDepartment as the focal point.13 \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months, from January 2015 to January 2018. An \ninternational firm (international, 20 person-months, intermittent) will be engaged to (i) produce a \nCAREC road safety strategy, and (ii) produce guidelines on incorporating road safety into \nCAREC road projects. The firm will be engaged using quality- and cost-based selection with a \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. A simplified technical proposal will be used for selection. \n \n20.  In addition, the TA will seek to mobilize and engage individual international and national \nconsultants to strengthen the capacity of CAREC member countries to manage and coordinate \nroad safety activities, including improved data collection, road collision research, engineering, \neducation,  and  enforcement  capacity.  Individual  experts  are  to  be  recruited,  as  individual \nexperience and qualifications are the main requirements for the positions. A senior road safety \nconsultant (international, 12 person-months, intermittent) will work over the 36-month TA period \nto assist ADB staff in overall implementation of the TA. In addition, road safety consultants \n                                                 \n13 The Transport and Communications Division of ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department will be in charge of the \nTA and will be primarily responsible for implementation oversight, accountability for outputs, and communication \nwith consultants and stakeholders. The Transport and Communications Division of ADB\u2019s East Asia Department \nwill assist the Transport and Communications Division of ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department with its duties, \nplaying a key role relating to communication with stakeholders in Mongolia; Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, \nPRC; and Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, PRC, which are under ADB\u2019s East Asia Department\u2019s coverage. \nADB\u2019s Regional and Sustainable Development Department will also assist with the TA. \n ", "5 \n \n(international, 8 person-months, intermittent) will be engaged on a short-term basis to assist the \nsenior  road  safety  consultant  in  (i)  implementing  road  safety  improvement  activities  and \nreviewing their progress; and (ii) designing and organizing workshops and training courses, \nincluding all necessary materials (e.g., training manuals, best practice guides, and reports). \nNational road safety consultants (20 person-months, intermittent), expected to be based in \nCAREC member countries, will provide organizational and administrative support for overall \ncoordination to implement activities in their respective countries. \n  \n21.  All consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime  to  time).  Lump-sum  payments  and/or  output-based  contracts  will  be  considered  for \nconsulting services under the TA. \n \n22.  Dissemination of outputs will be a key feature of the TA. The senior international road \nsafety consultant will prepare a knowledge dissemination strategy that will list all knowledge \nproducts  to  be  produced  as  part  of  the  TA,  and  for  each  product  decide  on  the  optimal \ndissemination method (e.g., website, peer-reviewed journal, ADB publication). \n \nIV.
