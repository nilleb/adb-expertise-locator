INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  strengthen  knowledge \nmanagement and innovation in the operations of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to deliver \ntailored knowledge and innovative solutions for its developing member countries (DMCs).1 It will \nenhance DMCs\u2019 capacity to address complex development challenges. The TA will support ADB \nin implementing its Knowledge Management Action Plan (KMAP) 2021\u20132025, which aims to \nimprove the impact, quality, and efficiency of ADB\u2019s knowledge using a country-differentiated \napproach.2 \n \n2.  The TA was endorsed in the corporate priority framework meeting in November 2020 and \nis  included  in  the  2021  Management-approved  results-based  workplan  of  the  Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department. It operationalizes ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 agenda \nto  strengthen  ADB  as a  knowledge  and  integrated  solutions  provider,3 and  aligns  with  all \noperational priorities, particularly accelerating progress in gender equality and strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  ADB has provided knowledge and financial support since 1967 amid a rapidly evolving \ndevelopment landscape, enabling it to stay relevant as a trusted knowledge solutions provider in \nthe region. Under Strategy 2030, ADB has renewed its commitment to work closely with DMCs to \nidentify their needs and produce relevant and customized knowledge solutions. The KMAP gives \neffect to this commitment. Knowledge management is critical to building an understanding of the \ncurrent and future needs of DMCs and identifying the operational areas where ADB can add the \nmost value, building on both past experience and present and emerging expertise. In policy \ndialogues, it facilitates efficient access to knowledge and better use of informed planning and \ndecision-making processes.  \n \n4.  The KMAP\u2019s overarching objective is for ADB to better deliver tailored knowledge solutions \nalongside financing. It will strengthen the country knowledge plan (CKP) process, which outlines \nADB\u2019s knowledge support to its DMCs. The CKP holds the potential for customizing knowledge \nsolutions to respond to DMCs\u2019 specific current and future development needs. However, the 2021 \ncountry partnership strategy (CPS) review indicated that the previous CKP and list of indicative \nknowledge products and events added limited value. There is a need to improve the value addition \nof CKPs to (i) support project pipelines or (ii) align with the respective CPS while also serving as \na forward-looking document that anticipates a DMC\u2019s emerging needs.5 Moreover, the 2020 \nevaluation of ADB\u2019s knowledge solutions for development found gaps in the process by which \nADB  identifies  regional  and  country  knowledge  needs,  and  highlighted  the  importance  of \nconducting extensive consultations with the government and other stakeholders, and having an \nintegrated and rapid approach for providing knowledge solutions.6 It underscores the need for a \nmore strategic and enhanced CKP process.  \n \n1   DMCs to be supported by the TA will be selected based on the requests of governments and those preparing country \npartnership strategies; they will include Bangladesh, Indonesia, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Uzbekistan, and Pacific \ncountries. \n2  ADB. 2021.

Manila. \n ", "2 \n \n5.  Underpinning the need for a better approach to CKPs and programming is the fact that \nDMCs increasingly struggle with complex challenges that\u202fcannot be addressed with traditional \nprojects and engagement avenues. The current unprecedented volatility\u2014evidenced, for example, \nby the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis\u2014is encouraging DMCs to look to innovation to \ntackle COVID-19\u2019s severe impacts and the urgent need for rapid recovery while addressing \nunderlying  systemic  weaknesses.  The  need  for  more  resilient  development  solutions  is \nincreasingly clear. DMCs require agile and integrated responses, financing, and knowledge \nacross sectors and themes to recover from the economic and social shocks caused by COVID-\n19. Only a few DMCs (India, Nepal, People\u2019s Republic of China, and Viet Nam) were ranked as \ninnovative in the Global Innovation Index for 2020,7 with the scores of many others lagging or \nfalling. ADB needs to support innovation that will help it build, invest in, and leverage an \necosystem of stakeholders and experts to help DMCs become knowledge economies and expand \ninnovation. 8 Increased knowledge and innovation capacity will equip DMCs and ADB to navigate \nsustainable development in a complex and volatile environment. \n \n6.  ADB value addition. Building on the KMAP actions, the TA will use the One ADB \napproach to address the need of DMCs for tailored knowledge and innovation. It will apply the \nenhanced CKP process of ADB\u2019s Strategy, Policy and Partnerships Department formulated with \nthe Knowledge Advisory Services Center of the Sustainable Development and Climate Change \nDepartment (SDCC-KC) to develop a more structured and integrated response to enhancing \nDMCs\u2019 capacity to absorb and apply knowledge. The TA will foster partnerships and regional \ncooperation. It will also improve the knowledge management capacity (KMC) of DMC government \nofficials (a significant proportion of whom will be women) to address development issues across \nagencies and implement policy reforms. ADB\u2019s principle of applying a differentiated approach is \ncritical to address the varying needs and institutional knowledge management and innovation \ncapacities of DMCs. \n \n7.  Lessons from previous and ongoing ADB projects. In 2019, ADB developed an \nenhanced CKP approach that involves a rigorous process for assessing country knowledge needs \nand prioritizing ADB\u2019s response.9 This TA will support and scale up this process across more \nDMCs by developing more knowledge products to help teams develop CKPs independently. \nSignificant progress has been made in mainstreaming innovative thinking and introducing new \nmodalities for identifying, designing, and delivering projects. In 2015, ADB approved TA to \nstrengthen the capacity of DMCs to solve development problems using innovative solutions.10 In \n2018, ADB (i) launched the technology innovation challenge to build DMC capacity to address \nspecific development challenges through partnerships with technology providers;11  and (ii) \npiloted its first Futures Thinking and Foresight program, and engaged with seven DMCs to explore \nhow ADB can engage on a more future-oriented policy dialogue.12 Lessons drawn by this TA \ninclude the need to (i) ensure a balance between supply- and demand-driven knowledge using \nfutures thinking and foresight; (ii) break silos through more collaborative relationships among \nvarious stakeholders using systems thinking; (iii) ground innovation in specific problems and \n \n7  Cornell University, INSEAD, and the World Intellectual Property Organization. 2020.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: DMCs\u2019 socioeconomic development (including \nrecovery from global pandemics such as COVID-19) is informed by ADB\u2019s knowledge-based and \ncountry-focused policies, programs, and operational experience.13 The TA will have the following \noutcome: Use of knowledge management and innovative development planning tools by DMCs \nincreased.14 The outputs will be (i) integrated approach for strengthening country knowledge \nprogramming  delivered,  (ii)  regional  and  country-level  innovation  supported,  and  (iii)  DMC \ncapacity in knowledge management and innovation improved. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Integrated approach for strengthening country knowledge programming \ndelivered. The TA will (i) (a) support operations departments and resident missions to develop \nADB  departmental  knowledge  management  roadmaps  to  clarify  measures  in  designing \nknowledge that fits local conditions, and (b) where needed, knowledge management specialists \nwill be fielded in resident missions to strengthen their KMC; and (ii) institutionalize and scale up \nthe enhanced CKP process to DMCs with planned or ongoing CPSs to provide them with \nresponsive knowledge solutions. As needed and in collaboration with resident missions, the TA \nwill extend institutional knowledge management support for DMCs as being done by ADB for the \nPhilippines\u2019  National  Economic  Development  Authority.15 Best  practices  in  developing  an \nenhanced CKP, guides, and manuals will be featured on a CKP portal that is under development \nthrough ongoing TA (footnote 9). Partnerships with development partners, universities, think tanks, \nand regional organizations will be explored to enhance strategic knowledge support for DMCs.16 \nResults will be captured and disseminated through blogs, infographics, and videos. \n \n10.  Output 2: Regional and country-level innovation supported. This output will enable \nADB, DMCs, and knowledge and innovation partners to design innovative solutions to address \nDMCs\u2019 knowledge needs. The output will (i) support the establishment of an ADB knowledge and \ninnovation hub, drawing from existing hubs,17 experiences from collaboration with innovative \npartners through new communities and platforms such as Tech For Impact,18 insights drawn from \n \n13 ADB. 2021. Knowledge Management Action Plan 2021\u20132025. Manila. \n14 The preliminary design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n15 ADB is helping the Philippines\u2019 National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) set up a knowledge management \nunit, assess knowledge management processes in NEDA, draft a knowledge management strategy and action plan \nthat will enable NEDA to maximize its human capital and knowledge, and develop a monitoring framework to \nimplement the knowledge management action plan. The support complements the government\u2019s ongoing initiatives \nto  strengthen  knowledge  management  and  planning,  including  implementation  of  the  National  Economic \nDevelopment Authority. 2017.

It will \ninclude developing approaches for ADB to support DMCs in embracing a cross-sectoral and integrated perspective \nand developing integrated multisector systems solutions to achieving development goals. The TA can draw lessons \nfrom the existing ADB Southeast Asia Department\u2019s Innovation Hub that fosters green finance. \n18 Tech For Impact.  \n ", "4 \nthe ADB innovation hub roundtable held in June 2020,19 and inputs from the ADB Innovation \nTaskforce; (ii) develop a handbook that will include criteria to identify innovative projects, and a \nresults framework that will measure the success of innovation; (iii) explore partnerships with \ninnovation organizations,20 public and private sector innovation labs and hubs, development \npartners, and regional organizations (footnote 16) to include the latest tools on innovation in ADB \noperations; and (iv) inform ADB\u2019s project administration instructions to ensure delivery of mission-\ndriven innovation for DMCs.21 Experience from ADB\u2019s efforts in mainstreaming innovation in \noperations and knowledge products and services will be featured on existing platforms to highlight \nlessons for potential replication.  \n \n11.  Output 3: Developing member country capacity in knowledge management and \ninnovation improved. This output will complement Outputs 1 and 2 to ensure sustainability of \nADB knowledge support to DMCs. The output will design and deliver (i) training programs such \nas fundamentals of knowledge management, human-centered design thinking, futures thinking \nand foresight; (ii) eLearning courses; and (iii) learning events such as Innovation Fair, Knowledge \nForum, and TEDx-style public speaking knowledge solution roundtables in DMCs. Focus will be \ngiven to the leadership capacity of women to implement knowledge management and innovation \nto  reinforce  their  active  role  in  policy  design  and  setting  priorities  that  have  significant \ndevelopment impacts. The output will provide flexibility to respond to the needs of DMCs and \nregional organizations to build KMC (footnote 16).  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund ($500,000 under TASF 7 and $500,000 under TASF-other \nsources). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB, through SDCC-KC, will administer the TA and will be the executing agency. SDCC-\nKC will implement the TA in close coordination with ADB operations departments and resident \nmissions. While all DMCs will benefit from the TA, targeted support will be extended to resident \nmissions that have requested support. Institutional knowledge management and innovation \nsupport for DMCs will be identified and coordinated with respective resident missions. Reporting \nmechanisms such as monitoring briefs, after-action reviews, and guides will be developed to \nfacilitate TA implementation. \n \n14.  Implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \n   \n \n19 The roundtable brought together innovation experts to share best practices in running innovation hubs, labs and \nnetworks in other organizations and countries. \n20 Such as Nesta, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development innovation policy team, Quicksand, \nUnited Nations Development Programme, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization futures \nliteracy, and University College London\u2019s Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose. \n21 M.
