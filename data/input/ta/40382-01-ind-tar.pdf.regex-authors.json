INTRODUCTION \n1.  In 2006, the Government of India asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help it \ndevelop the infrastructure the country needs to tap the large economic potential of its tourism \nsector. As a first step, ADB provided technical assistance (TA) in 2006 to create a national \ntourism infrastructure development road map.1 The TA assessed tourism market trends and the \nendowments, destinations, and circuits in the country with the highest tourism potential. It also \nidentified the infrastructure requirements for these circuits over the next 10 years and the \ninstitutional and regulatory constraints to sustainable tourism growth. ADB provided additional \ntwo-phase  TA  in  2007  after  the  government  sought  its  assistance  in  preparing  a  tourism \ninfrastructure  development  project  for  possible  ADB  financing.2 Phase  1  prepared  a  more \nspecific  road  map  for  each  of  four  participating  states\u2014Himachal  Pradesh,  Punjab,  and \nUttarakhand, the three main states of an identified northwest Himalayan heritage tourism circuit; \nand Tamil Nadu, the anchor state of the south heritage tourism circuit. A framework was also \nprepared  for  policy  and  sector  reforms  necessary  to  develop  environmentally  sustainable, \nculturally sensitive, and socially inclusive tourism.3 Phase 2 of this TA sought to improve the \nproject management and implementation capacities of the relevant agencies and ready them for \nproject implementation. Based on the phase 1 outputs, an ADB fact-finding mission carried out \ndue diligence in February\u2013March 2010 and the ensuing tourism infrastructure development \ninvestment  project  was  approved  in  September  2010,  providing  the  four  states  with  a \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to develop the tourism sector.4 The government has now \nrequested  this  capacity  development  TA  to  supplement  phase  2  of  the  second  TA.5 This \ncapacity development TA will also strengthen the pro-poor design of the MFF. The preliminary \ndesign and monitoring framework, which reflects the impact, outcome, and outputs agreed on \nby the government and ADB, is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  India is one of the fast-growing economies in the world. Its gross domestic product (GDP) \nexpanded  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  7.7%  during  FY2002\u2013FY2007  and  is  forecast  to \nincrease to 8.7% during the 11th Five-Year Plan (2007\u20132012). India has had mixed success in \nits efforts to make this economic growth more inclusive. The percentage of the population below \nthe poverty line decreased from 36% in FY1994 to 27.5% in FY2005 but the rate of decline did \nnot  match  GDP  growth.  A  rural\u2013urban  divide  is  rapidly  widening.  Per  capita  household \nexpenditure in rural areas is estimated at less than half of that in urban areas and economic \ngrowth  has  not  been  uniform  across  India\u2019s  regions.  Reducing  rural\u2013urban  disparities  by \ngenerating growth in the agriculture sector alone is neither easy nor effective. To narrow the gap, \nit is important that the non-agriculture and service sectors in rural areas also be stimulated to \nprovide more economic opportunities and employment. \n                                                 \n1  Component Technical Assistance for Tourism Infrastructure Development Study under ADB. 2006. Technical \nAssistance Cluster to India for Project Processing and Capacity Development. Manila (TA 4814-IND). The \ncomponent TA was approved on 18 December by the director general of the South Asia Department. \n2  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to India for Preparing the Inclusive Tourism Infrastructure Development Project. \nManila (TA 7014-IND). The TA was approved on 12 December by the President. To complete phase 2 of the TA, \nwhich focuses on implementation capacity development support to two of the four participating states, Himachal \nPradesh and Punjab, its completion date was extended to 31 August 2011. \n3  These four states sought voluntarily to participate in the implementation of the road map and the government \nsupported their participation. \n4  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to India for Infrastructure Development Investment Program for Tourism. Manila (approved on 28 \nSeptember). Its first tranche (Loan 2676-IND) was subsequently approved on 4 October 2010 by the President. \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 September 2010. \n ", "2   \n \n3.  India has the potential to become one of the world\u2019s top tourist destinations. The sector \nhas grown quickly, with total foreign tourist arrivals increasing from 2.38 million in 2002 to \naround 5.37 million in 2008, a 126% rise overall and an average growth of 14.6% a year. \nTourism generated about $11.75 billion in foreign exchange in 2008. Domestic tourism is also \ngrowing. Total visits rose from 269.6 million in 2002 to 562.9 million in 2008 (up about 109% \noverall or 13.1% on average per annum).6 India\u2019s prospects are good in virtually every tourism \nfield\u2014cultural, religious, ecological, adventure, medical, and relaxation. Richly varied tourist \nattractions permit product differentiation and branding. Rapid expansion and upgrading of the \nsector\u2019s infrastructure and services to international standards will increase India\u2019s appeal and \nmake it more efficient and better able to compete with other international destinations.7 More \njobs and improved livelihoods will result.  \n \n4.  In 2002, new government policy recognized tourism\u2019s strong potential for growth and \nemployment  generation,  particularly  in  less-developed  parts  of  the  country.  In  2003\u20132004, \naccording to surveys, the tourism sector contributed only 5.9% to the GDP, much lower, for \nexample, than the world average of 10.4% in 2007.8 At the time, it was providing about 41.8 \nmillion people with full-time jobs. With increased investment, the sector has a great deal of room \nto grow, to generate more direct and indirect employment through its forward and backward \nlinkages,  and  to  make  a  beneficial  impact  on  rural  poverty  and  rural\u2013urban  inequity.  The \ngovernment\u2019s tourism strategy is reflected in its current Five-Year Plan and in ADB\u2019s India \ncountry partnership strategy 2009\u20132012, which supports development of urban infrastructure \nneeded to strengthen the tourism potential of heritage cities in an environmentally sustainable \nmanner.9 \n \n5.  To  this  end,  the  government  has  committed  to  (i) assisting  the  states  with  tourism \ndevelopment; (ii) encouraging private sector provision of tourist facilities and services through \npublic  sector  infrastructure  development;  and  (iii) providing  regulatory  support  to  ensure \nsustainable tourism. The tourism sector road map for the country prepared with ADB\u2019s TA sets \ntargets for increases in visitor volumes, average length of stay, and spending (footnote 1). It \nalso emphasizes more equitable sharing of tourism benefits with local communities. The road \nmap includes a set of recommendations for capacity building and human resource development. \nWhile the sector\u2019s growth during the 10th Five-Year Plan period (2002\u20132007) was impressive, \ntargets under the current plan, including 10 million international tourist arrivals by 2011 as well \nas  812  million  domestic  tourist  visits,  have  proved  challenging,  due  in  part  to  the  global \neconomic slowdown that started in 2008. \n \n6.  Private sector participation is a relatively recent phenomenon in India\u2019s tourism sector. \nAs more private enterprises join the industry, many states are still making the transition from \nbeing tourism service providers to promoting and regulating tourism. If tourism\u2019s full economic \npotential is to be unleashed, however, the public sector has a key role to play by developing the \nnecessary infrastructure. It must address the lack and poor quality of connectivity infrastructure \nto the states from India\u2019s gateways and between the tourist attractions within each state. The \ndestinations themselves lack such basic services as water supply, sanitation, and solid waste \nmanagement. Infrastructure to support community-based tourism is almost nonexistent.  \n                                                 \n6  Government of India, Ministry of Tourism. 2009.

Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009\u20132012. Manila. \n ", "  3\n \n7.  While such infrastructure is put in place under the MFF, the tourism sector must be \nreformed so that it can develop more sustainably and be more inclusive. Key challenges include \n(i) insufficient public sector financing for balanced distribution of economic opportunities across \neach state; (ii) inadequate institutional capacities for heritage site management; (iii) the absence \nof an effective enabling environment for greater private sector participation and, in particular, of \npolicy and regulatory reforms to provide for adaptive reuse of publicly-owned heritage buildings \nso that additional means of cost recovery are established; (iv) poor operation and maintenance \nof tourism infrastructure; and (v) the lack of effective mechanisms to engage local communities \nin the tourism value chain through community-based, tourism-related economic and livelihood \nactivities.  Detailed  discussions  about  the  national  tourism  development  road  map  and  the \ntourism road maps of the four participating states can be found in the framework financing \nagreement for the MFF (footnote 4). In particular, the participating states will promote homestay \nprograms and other noncommercial or semicommercial lodging alternatives such as bed and \nbreakfast (B&B) facilities. \n \n8.   During the crucial MFF start-up period, before this task is handed over to the loan-\nfunded  consultant  teams,  the  capacity  development  TA  will  help  the  participating  states \novercome these key challenges and successfully jump-start the policy-driven sector reforms.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA impact will be the successful implementation of the MFF, particularly during its \nstart-up  period.  The  impact  can  be  assessed  by  the  project  readiness  checklist  of  the \nDepartment of Economic Affairs for each participating state. The expected outcome will be \nincreased  readiness  to  implement  the  MFF  when  the  TA  ends  at  the  executing  agency, \nimplementing agencies, and relevant local communities of each participating state. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Two state-based consultant teams will be engaged to assist two of the client states (i.e., \nteam 1 in Tamil Nadu and team 2 in Uttarakhand). Individuals already recruited under phase 2 \nof the previous ADB TA will make up the respective state-based consultant teams for Himachal \nPradesh and Punjab. Another recruit from that TA will act as a safeguards specialist (social and \nenvironment) for Himachal Pradesh and Punjab (footnote 2). The third consultant team (team 3) \nunder this TA will provide specialized support for all four participating states, each of which is \nsupported by a state-based consultant team (i.e., team 1 for Tamil Nadu and team 2 for \nUttarakhand under this TA, and one team each for Himachal Pradesh and Punjab under phase \n2 of the previous ADB TA). \n \n11.  The expected TA outputs include (i) overall project management capacity improvement \nat the executing agencies and implementing agencies of the participating states, with respect to \npreparation  of  various  subprojects  (project  readiness  on  general  management);  (ii) overall \nprocurement management capacity improvement at the executing agencies and implementing \nagencies,  with  respect  to  preparation  of  tendering  for  subprojects  (project  readiness  on \nprocurement); (iii) preparation and pilot implementation of a strategy to facilitate partnerships \nwith the private sector and to promote community participation in tourism-related economic \nactivities, such as B&Bs, homestay programs, and traditional culture and crafts, particularly in \nthe rural areas concerned; (iv) preparation of tourist destination management and master plans, \n ", "4   \nincluding  mobility  plans,  with  sections  on  gender  aspects,  along  with  support  for  their \nendorsement; and (v) a baseline survey of gender-disaggregated employment statistics, which \nwill be used for target setting in some of the design and monitoring framework indicators. \nPromotion  of  ecotourism  is  a  key  feature  of  the  MFF.  Promotion  of  B&Bs  and  homestay \nprograms should help generate significant alternative livelihood opportunities in rural areas, \nespecially for women. Best practices in managing these facilities will be shared to help ensure a \nsuccessful roll-out of rural livelihood enhancement programs. \n \n12.  To put the strategy of promoting community participation in tourism-related economic \nactivities  into  effect,  workshops  and  seminars  will  be  conducted  not  only  for  relevant \ngovernment  staff  members  but  also  for  local  communities,  concerned  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), community-based organizations, and civil society groups. Each of the \nthree consultant teams under this TA will engage an NGO as a subcontractor for training the \ndiverse group of people mentioned above. The NGOs\u2019 specific tasks will include (i) developing \nawareness about tourism; (ii) training for undertaking community-based tourism (CBT) business \noperations and activities; (iii) training for producing and marketing products in the tourism value \nchain, such as handicrafts, B&Bs, homestay programs, and other noncommercial or semi-\ncommercial lodging alternatives; and (iv) training to minimize the negative social impacts of \ntourism and to help generate more employment through the MFF. The subcontractor NGOs for \nteam 1 for Tamil Nadu and team 2 for Uttarakhand will look after their respective states while \nthe subcontractor for team 3 will look after the two participating states of Himachal Pradesh and \nPunjab. \n \n13.  Assumptions and risks.  One risk faced by the MFF that the TA is designed to support \nis deterioration in global and/or domestic economic conditions that might reduce market demand \nfor tourism. Another risk involves the potential for poor implementation performance and/or \nimplementation delays. While the first is beyond its control, the TA will significantly mitigate the \nsecond and help ensure the realization of expected benefits and impacts. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The estimated cost of the TA will be the equivalent of $1,200,000. The government has \nrequested that ADB finance the equivalent of $1,000,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, funded by the Government of Japan. The \nGovernment of India will finance the balance of the cost, equivalent to $200,000, through the \nprovision of office space, remuneration for counterpart staff (including their field per diem and \ntransportation), and other in-kind contributions (Appendix 2). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The  executing  agencies  will  be  the  departments  of  tourism  or  the  equivalent \ndepartments of the four participating states. The implementing agencies will be the states\u2019 \ntourism boards or the equivalent. At the state level, based on the overall strategic guidance \nprovided by the executing agency, each state-based consultant team (teams 1 and 2 under this \nTA, and two teams each of which consists of individual consultants recruited under phase 2 of \nthe  previous  ADB  TA)  will  support  the  staffs  of  the  executing  agency,  the  implementing \nagencies, and other agencies concerned to improve project management and implementation \ncapacities and advance project preparedness. The specialized consultant team (team 3) will \nprovide support on various subject areas, based on the needs of each of the four states. \n \n ", "  5\n16.  The  participating  states  will  provide  (i) all  relevant  documents,  data,  statistics, \ninformation, and maps at their disposal; (ii) appropriate and qualified counterpart staff, as well \nas their field per diem and field transport costs; (iii) a program director from each executing \nagency to be assigned before the consultant mobilization; (iv) office accommodation and office \nequipment, including desks and chairs, and local communication; (v) logistical assistance for \nworkshops and seminars, including the venues, and identification and recruitment of participants; \nand (vi) utility costs, covering electricity and water. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months with a target start-up of January 2011. Each \nstate-based consultant team (team 1 for Tamil Nadu and team 2 for Uttarakhand) consists of \n(i) a procurement specialist; (ii) a civil engineer; and (iii) a conservation architect and/or planner \n(all national). The specialist consultant team (team 3) consists of (i) a safeguards specialist \n(social and environment, national); (ii) a financial management specialist (national); and (iii) a \nplanner (international). Either the procurement specialist or the civil engineer will play the role of \nteam leader for teams 1 and 2. Each of the three teams will engage an NGO in the preparation \nand pilot implementation of the strategy to promote community participation in tourism-related \neconomic activities. The planner will lead team 3 and also carry out overall coordination among \nthe four participating states, their respective state-based consultant teams, one individually-\nrecruited  safeguards  specialist  (social  and  environment),  and  ADB.  The  outline  terms  of \nreference for consultants is in Appendix 3. \n \n18.  The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). About 88 person-months of consulting \nservices  will  be  required\u20148  person-months  from  international  consultants  and  80  person-\nmonths from national consultants. Each of the three consultant teams will be recruited on a \ncorporate basis under the quality- and cost-based selection method using biodata technical \nproposal. The default quality-cost ratio of 80:20 will be used for all the three contract packages. \nTo avoid potential conflict of interest between the assignments under this TA and the ensuing \nloan-funded state-based assignments, the firm awarded the team 3 assignment will not be \nallowed to bid for any of the loan-funded state-based assignments, while the firms awarded the \nteam  1  and  team  2  assignments  will  not  be  permitted  to  bid  for  any  of  the  loan-funded \nassignments in the state each serves under the TA. Disbursements under the TA will be made \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time).  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000  to  the \nGovernment of India to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction \nfor Capacity Development for Project Management of Infrastructure Development for Rural \nLivelihood Enhancement, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nSummary  Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   Risks \nImpact  By TA completion:  \uf0b7 Progress reports  Assumption \nSuccessful  \uf0b7  Prompt  \uf0b7 ADB review mission  \uf0b7 Participating states \nimplementation of the  implementation and  aide memoires  are committed to \nMFF 0046-IND:  timely reporting of  \uf0b7 Completion report  sustainable tourism \nInfrastructure  project activities, and  development. \nDevelopment Investment  of procurement of \nProgram for Tourism  initial subprojects in \n(MFF), in particular  particular \nduring its start-up period   \n \nOutcome  By TA completion:  \uf0b7  Department of  Assumptions \nIncreased MFF project  \uf0b7  Executing agency  Economic Affairs   \uf0b7 Participating states \nreadiness at executing  and implementing  project readiness  are committed to \nagency and  agencies of each  checklist  playing the role of \nimplementing agencies  participating state, as  \uf0b7  Progress reports  facilitator and \nof each MFF  well as the relevant  \uf0b7 ADB review mission  regulator of \nparticipating state, and  local communities,  aide memoires  commercial tourism \nin relevant local  fully ready for the  \uf0b7 TA Completion report  development. \ncommunities   MFF   \n \nOutputs  By TA completion:    Assumptions \n1.
