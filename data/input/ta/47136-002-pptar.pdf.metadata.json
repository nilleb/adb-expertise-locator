Cambodian youth continue to be employed in low-paid and low-skilled informal sector \njobs. Secondary school graduates are unprepared for subsequent education, training and work. \nCambodia strives toward universal basic education up to Grade 9. Given the likely competition \nCambodia will face upon ASEAN economic integration, Grade 9 education will not be sufficient. \nThe  proposed  Strengthening  Secondary  Education  and  Teaching  of  Math  and  Science \n(SSETMS) aims to support the Government of Cambodia in improving access to, and relevance \nand  quality  of,  secondary  education  (SE;  grades  7\u201312).  A  key  project  focus  is  on  (i) \nimplementing a social safety net program for poor families to keep children in school and \ncomplete  Grade  9;  (ii)  integrating  employability  skills  into  the  upper  secondary  education \ncurriculum  in  partnership  with  private  sector  and  employers;  and  (iii)  improving  science, \nmathematics, and technology education at the upper secondary level.  \n \n2.  To design the Program, a robust participatory process involving all relevant stakeholders \nis necessary to seek consensus on the scope, coverage and priority reforms to be supported by \nthe Program. The participatory process will be guided by the Ministry of Education Youth and \nSport  (MoEYS)  Education  Strategic  Plan  2009\u20132013.  Further  informing  the  participatory \nprocess will be stakeholder priorities and lessons learned from initiatives under EEQP to inform \nthe design of the Program. The design process will also involve engagement of employers and \nprivate  sector  to  determine  the  scope  of  education  interventions  that  serve  labor  market \ndemands. Lessons learned from the ongoing PPP technical assistance projects in Cambodia \nwill inform the design of PPP mechanisms for secondary education delivery under the proposed \nSSETMS.   \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n3.  The TA will (i) identify priority policy reforms for support under the policy loan, as well as \nspecific  targets  for  tranche  conditions;  (ii)  prepare  a  situation  and  gap  analysis  of  upper \nsecondary  education  and  detailed  analysis  of  upper  secondary  provision  in  target  areas, \ncapacity of science, mathematics, and technology teachers, student assessment in science, \nmathematics,  and  technology  skills;  and  employment  prospects  for  grade  12  graduates;          \n(iii) determine the scope and feasibility of proposed project investments, ranging from capacity \nbuilding  to  civil  works  and  equipment;  (iv)  prepare  cost  estimates  and  a  financing  plan;            \n(v)  analyze  financial  and  economic  viability  and  sustainability;  and  (vi)  determine  detailed \nimplementation arrangements.
