A  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  required  to  prepare  a  results-based  lending  (RBL) \nprogram to be financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The TA will conduct due \n \ndiligence work, including assessments of the following government\u2019s systems that are related to \nthe  implementation  of  the  RBL  program:  (i)  the  soundness  of  the  government  investment \nprogram,  results  and  links  with  disbursements  under  the  RBL  program,  expenditures  and \nfinancing, and implementation arrangements; (ii) fiduciary and financial management systems; \n(iii)  safeguard  systems  (environmental);  (iv)  procurement  systems;  and  (v)  monitoring  and \nevaluation systems. As a result of the assessments, a program action plan will be developed, \nincluding strengthening of the government staff capacity. A program result framework and \nmatrix  will  also  be  prepared  with  clear  result  indicators,  including  those  to  be  chosen  as \ndisbursement-linked indicators (DLIs). \n \nB.

Consulting Services \n \n4.  The TA will require 7.5 person-months (pm) of international and 20.0 pm of national \nconsultant services from a total of 11 consultants, to be engaged individually. ADB will engage \nthe consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). Lump-sum payments and/or output-based contracts will be considered for \nconsulting services under the TA when appropriate. \n \n5.  The outline terms of reference for the consultants are described below in paras. 6 to 13. \n \n6.  Sector and subsector analysis. One international consultant (also for the technical \naspects) and one national disaster management consultants will be engaged to review the \navailable analysis and assessment on the disaster risk management, particularly on seismic risk \nmanagement. The consultants will conduct additional analysis and assessment, as necessary, \non the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the institutional arrangements, \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \nincluding  the  government  policies,  strategies,  legislations,  and  plans,  on  seismic  risk \nmanagement.  The  consultants  will  identify  the  potential  risks  for  the  program  design  and \nimplementation and recommended corrective measures and actions for inclusion in the program \naction plan with clear results and monitoring mechanisms. \n \n7.  Technical aspects. One international consultant (also for the sector and subsector \nanalysis) and one national disaster management consultant will be engaged to assess the \ngovernment\u2019s seismic safety investment program, including technical and economic soundness \nof the program (adequacy and economic efficiency), results and links with disbursements under \nthe RBL program, expenditures and financing, and implementation arrangements. Necessary \nmeasures and actions to be taken to strengthen the government investment program will be \nidentified for inclusion in the program action plan with clear results and monitoring mechanisms. \n \n8.  Economic  analysis.

This will be based on the Armenia country assessment of environmental \nsafeguard capacity study, which has recently been endorsed by Ministry of Environment and \nNatural Resources. The safeguard management system will consist of a screening checklist for \npotential  environmental  impacts  which  may  affect  the  program  design  and  recommended \nnecessary measures and actions for mitigation, with clear results and monitoring mechanisms.  \n \n11.  Monitoring  and  evaluation.  One  international  and  one  national  monitoring  and \nevaluation consultants will be engaged to assess the government monitoring and evaluation \nsystems and identify gap that may affect the program implementation and results monitoring \nand evaluation.
