INTRODUCTION\n1. In  May  1999,  the  Government  of  Cambodia  requested  assistance  from  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to develop its financial sector. In response to the request, ADB\nassisted the Government to develop a preliminary financial sector \u201croad map\u201d for the next 20\nyears through a financial sector study1 that was finalized in June 1999.\n2. Based on the preliminary road map, a fact-finding mission for a technical assistance (TA)\nto develop a policy reform plan for the financial sector was fielded in March 2000. The mission\ndiscussed with the Government the long-term goal for  sector development  and  immediate\nobjectives for the proposed program loan as well as the scope, implementation arrangements,\nterms of reference for the consulting services, and cost estimate for the TA. The mission\u2019s\nfindings and understanding with the Government formed the basis for formulating the TA. The\nTA is included in ADB\u2019s 2000 country assistance program.2\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. The Cambodian financial sector is at an early stage of development and lacks public\nconfidence due to several inefficient financial institutions; weak financial market foundations\n(e.g., legal, institutional, and instruments frameworks); and inadequate physical financial market\ninfrastructure (e.g., communication facilities, clearing and settlement system, and brokerage\nhouses).\n4. The introduction of reforms during 1989 was intended to transform the banking sector\nfrom  a  monobanking  system  to  a  two-tiered  system.  In  1990,  treasury  operations  were\ntransferred to the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC)\nwas initially ranked as a ministry and largely used to finance budget deficits. In 1996, NBC was\nestablished as an autonomous public entity with the principle mission of maintaining price\nstability. A total of 31 licensed commercial banks are now operating, including (i) 2 state-owned\nbanks,  (ii)  22  private  locally  incorporated  banks,  and  (iii)  7  foreign  bank  branches.  The\nGovernment is relicensing all commercial banks under the new Financial Institutions Law, which\nwas promulgated in November 1999.\n5. The  insurance  sector  is  comprised  of  a  government-owned  insurance  entity\u2013the\nCambodian  National  Insurance  Company  (CAMINCO),  which  acts  as  the  regulator-cum-\nunderwriter and broker\u2013and seven nongovernment insurance companies that are performing as\nagencies for CAMINCO and risk underwriters through fronting agreements, whereby CAMINCO\ntakes 10 percent risk.\n6. Nonbanking  financial  institutions  operate  to  a  limited  degree  in  Cambodia.  NBC\nregulates currency exchange bureaus, and a number of nongovernment organizations provide\nfinance  to  the  rural  and  microfinance  sectors.3  Interest  is  currently  being  shown  by  the\ndevelopment of consumer credit (including credit cards, hire purchase, and similar products)\n                                                       \n1 See Appendix 1 for the outline of the road map. The road map, which is available upon request, has been prepared\nin close consultation with the Government, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank.\n2\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) on 29 February 2000.\n3 ADB intends to assist these sectors through the proposed Rural Credit and Savings Project including assisting the\ntransformation of nongovernment organizations into licensed microfinance institutions. TA 2818: Rural Credit and\nSavings, for $600,000, approved on 26 June 1997, will assist institutional strengthening of the Rural Development\nBank.", "2\nand leasing products. Cambodia has no formal capital market, although a sense of urgency to\ncreate such a market is felt in some quarters of Government and by some entrepreneurs.\nHowever, due to the lack of prerequisites, such as the underpinning legislation, the financial\nsector infrastructure to support a sound financial  market,  and a payments  system,  capital\nmarket planning will have to be considered in the future. Mechanisms for mobilizing resources\nand  attracting  domestic and foreign  long-term  investment  are  currently  limited  due  to  the\nundeveloped state of the financial sector intermediaries and infrastructure as well as the lack of\na legal framework (e.g., a comprehensive commercial code covering secured transactions and\ninsolvency procedures).\n7. In terms of the financial sector\u2019s impact on the economy, the total banking subsector\nassets represent about 15 percent of gross domestic product. This is relatively low compared to\nother developing economies (Appendix 2, Figure 1). Moreover, the US dollar is heavily used\n(Appendix 2, Figure 2) as the medium of exchange, while the Cambodia riel is used primarily in\nrural areas. The formal banking subsector is concentrated in Phnom Penh, although 85 percent\nof the population resides in rural areas. Consequently, an extensive amount of riel is held\noutside the banking system.\n8. Since 1995, reflecting growth in the industry and services sectors, banking subsector\ndeposits, loans, and total assets have increased steadily (Appendix 2, Figures 3 and 4). Trends\nin the Cambodian economy reveal that the potential demand for financial sector products is\nhelping financial sector development, which will further fuel the real economy through improved\nmobilization  of  resources  and  the  channeling  of  savings  into  productive  investment\nopportunities. However, the banking sector maintains excess liquidity that could be used more\neffectively to facilitate growth in the real economy, as evidenced by the percentage of cash to\ntotal assets, which is about 19 percent for the banking subsector as a whole. This is largely due\nto the lack of a credit culture in Cambodia and a weak legal and regulatory foundation for\nextending  credit.  Consequently,  banks  in  Cambodia  are  holding  a  high  percentage  of\nnonearning assets (only 66 percent of total banking assets in Cambodia are earning assets).\n9. The lack of adequate human resources constrains economic development. For example,\nonly 46 percent of NBC employees have completed high school and higher education, and have\nhad formal training in core skills (such as banking, accounting, statistical analysis, and general\nmanagement) and specialized competencies necessary for the effective operation of a market-\ndriven economy. (Such competency areas include the legal framework for commercial and\nfinancial business, accountancy, and financial institution management.)\n10. In  October  1999,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  approved  an  enhanced\nstructural  adjustment  facility  (now  the  poverty  reduction  and  growth  facility  [PRGF])  for\nCambodia in an amount equivalent to special drawing rights (SDR)58.5 million (about $81.6\nmillion) to support the Government\u2019s economic program for 1999-2002. Objectives of the IMF\neffort are to rebuild economic growth and per capita income and to reduce poverty. Specific\ngoals are to rebuild economic infrastructure and strengthen the business environment while\naddressing governance problems that impede sustainable development. In the area of structural\nreforms, reform of the banking system is addressed with a priority on relicensing all commercial\nbanks. Building the central bank\u2019s supervisory capacity is also emphasized.\n11. Financial sector reform objectives for the banking sector under the PRGF include:\n(i)  NBC avoiding financing the budget (1999-2002);\n(ii)  complete onsite inspection of all private banks (1999);", "3\n(iii)  improvement of NBC\u2019s supervision capacity, including by strengthening staff and\nsetting supervision guidelines (1999-2002);\n(iv)  strengthening of the legal framework by adopting a new law on commercial\nbanks and financial institutions (November 1999);\n(v)  relicensing of all existing commercial banks under the new financial institutions\nlaw and closing of those that do not comply with the law (2000-2002); and\n(vi)  restructuring of the Foreign Trade Bank (1999-2001).\n12. The World Bank is also proposing support for development of Cambodia\u2019s financial\nsector, including possible assistance to establish an accounting profession, a new accounting\nlaw, and an education program for accountants. With the International Finance Corporation, the\nWorld Bank is planning a project for rural credit in 2003.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objectives\n13. The TA is aimed at preparing a master plan for developing the financial sector, including\naddressing strategic concerns related to the legal and regulatory framework, institution capacity\nbuilding, rural and microfinance development, strengthening of NBC, and extension of financial\nsector intermediation (Appendix 1).  The TA will conduct a feasibility study, based on the master\nplan, to identify ADB\u2019s possible midterm assistance to the Cambodian financial sector. The TA\nwill adopt a participatory approach to development of the master plan among the policy makers,\nwith the goal of building a consensus for reform and identifying a critical mass of competent\ncounterpart personnel for the long term.\n14. Output of the TA is expected to address both the long-term goal and shorter term\ndevelopment priorities for ADB  lending assistance  to  the  sector.  The  long-term  goal  is  to\ndevelop a viable, inclusive, and effective financial system to enhance resource mobilization in\nsupport of sustainable economic growth and development. Immediate objectives will be to (i)\nalleviate  policy  constraints  for  financial  sector  development,  (ii)  develop  the  institutional\nfoundations for the financial markets, (iii) establish a foundation for contractual savings, (iv)\nbuild capacity in policy making authorities, and (v) strengthen the role of the NBC.\nB. Scope\n15. The TA will provide an in-depth analysis of the structure and performance of the financial\nsector identifying gaps, constraints and weaknesses hindering the efficient mobilization and\nallocation of funds by the financial system, such problem areas include those in the policy\nframework (interest rate, exchange rate, and credit policies); market infrastructure (i.e., network\nof financial institutions, the legal and regulatory framework and process, accounting and audit\nsystem, payments mechanism, clearing and settlement system, and information disclosure and\ndissemination); and institutional capacity (level of technology, know-how, and available skills).\nThe TA will estimate the likely demand on and prospective role of the sector based on the\ncountry\u2019s economic development program and linkages between the sector development and\npoverty alleviation efforts by the Government. The TA will assist the Government to develop a\nprogram of reforms detailing policy measures to meet the findings in the in-depth analysis and\nthe estimate of demand for financial services, taking into account previous and current reforms,\nongoing  adjustment  programs  of  other  funding  agencies,  and  possible  private  sector\ninvolvement for the programmed policy reform in the financial sector as a basis for the master\nplan for the Government. The TA will assist the Government to draft a detailed and feasible", "4\nstep-by-step plan for implementing the policy reforms program and fine-tuning the \u201croad map\u201d\nidentifying the possible areas for ADB lending assistance. In particular, such areas will include\nthe pacing and sequencing of reform measures. Pacing will be based on an assessment of the\ncapacity of NBC and other Government ministries and agencies involved, identifying where\ntechnical support may be required to facilitate implementation. Sequencing will include reforms\nneeded to be taken in parallel in other sectors, such as, fiscal policy, legal and regulatory\nframework, and state enterprises. The TA will assist the Government to estimate the adjustment\ncosts relating to or likely to arise as a result of a possible policy reform program.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n16. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $948,000 equivalent, comprising $675,000 in\nforeign exchange costs and $273,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will provide a total\ngrant  of  $800,000  to  finance  the  entire  foreign  exchange  costs  amounting  to  $675,000\nequivalent and $125,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The TA will be financed by ADB on\na grant basis, from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The balance\nof the local currency costs amounting to $148,000 equivalent will be met by the Government\u2019s\nown resources to cover counterpart staff, office accommodation, and training and seminar\nfacilities. The detailed cost estimates of the TA are in Appendix 3.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n17. NBC will be the Executing Agency for the  TA.  The  Government\u2019s  Financial  Sector\nSteering  Committee  (FSSC)4  and  its  working  group  initiated  by  NBC  has  the  long-term\nresponsibilities of inter-ministry coordination for financial sector development and coordination\nof funding agencies. FSSC will be the Implementing Agency under the supervision of NBC. The\nsecretariat of the FSSC will act as the focal point of TA implementation for the consulting firm\nand ADB, and as a member of all meetings required under the TA.\n18. The TA will be implemented over six months, from mid-September 2000 to mid-March\n2001.  The  consulting  services  required  under  the  TA  consist  of  18  person-months  of\ninternational  consultants  and  15  person-months  of  domestic  consultants.  International\nconsultants will include (i) a financial sector specialist and team leader (6 person-months), (ii) an\neconomist (4 person-months), (iii) an accounting and audit expert (3 person-months), (iv) a legal\nexpert (3 person-months), and (v) a banking expert (2 person-months). Domestic consultants\nwill include (i) an economist (6 person-months), (ii) a banking expert (6 person-months), and (iii)\na legal expert (3 person-months).\n19. The consulting services will be provided by an international consulting firm in association\nwith a qualified domestic consulting firm and/or individual consultants in the required areas. The\nconsultants for the TA will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of\ndomestic consultants. Consulting firms will be invited to submit simplified technical proposals to\nADB on the most efficient and cost-effective means of deploying international and domestic\nexperts in fulfilling the stated objective, tasks, and outputs of the TA within the time specified.\nThe outline terms of reference for the consulting services are in Appendix 4.\n                                                       \n4 Consisting of representatives from NBC, Ministry of Economy and Finance, Ministry of Commerce, and Council for\nthe Development of Cambodia.", "5\n20. The consulting firm will purchase necessary office equipment, books, and information\nmaterials in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The equipment will be handed\nover to NBC at TA completion, and some of the purchased goods will be used by the Banker\u2019s\nInstitute\u2019s resource center for its students. Also, software necessary to update the \u201croad map\u201d\nwill be provided to each member of the working group\u2019s office for effective information sharing\namong the related Government agencies.\n21. The consulting firm will prepare (i) an inception report, including a detailed work program\nfor the TA, to be submitted within one month after commencement; (ii) a progress report, three\nmonths after commencement; (iii) a draft final report, compiling all TA activities and consultants\u2019\nrecommendations, to be submitted at least one month before TA completion; and (iv) a final\nreport, at the completion of the TA.\n22. The tripartite review meetings, involving the Government, the consulting firm, and ADB,\nwill  be  organized  by  NBC  three  times  (1-2  weeks  after  the  submission  of  the  inception,\nprogress, and draft final reports in conjunction with ADB missions to review the progress of TA\nimplementation and to resolve any outstanding issues). The meetings will be chaired by the\ngovernor of NBC or a person designated by the governor, and will have representatives from\nthe member organizations of the FSSC and the economic advisory team to the Prime Minister.\n23. The consulting firm will prepare, organize, and conduct a consensus-building seminar\nafter each tripartite meeting. The first will serve to build consensus on the TA\u2019s purpose among\nthe policy makers and senior Government officials. The second will be for the major external\nfunding agencies, giving them an opportunity for an open discussion with the Government on\ntheir interested subsectors of future assistance. The third will be for the policy makers and\nsenior Government officials expressing their commitment on policy reform to the financial sector\nparticipants, including commercial banks and interested business community.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n24. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of Technical Assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Kingdom of\nCambodia in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 for the purpose of preparing\nthe Financial Sector Development Program, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "6 Appendix 1, page 1\nSTRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND PRELIMINARY ROADMAP\nFOR FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT\n1. In November 1999, the Government of Cambodia, assisted by the Asian Development\nBank, identified its financial sector development strategic objectives (summarized here) and a\npreliminary \u201croad map\u201d was developed based on inputs from Cambodian authorities, the private\nsector, and initial inputs from multilateral agencies. Accordingly, a number of suggestions reflect\nvarious  approaches  to  financial  sector  development  based  on  several  models  and  the\nexperiences of many countries, for which Cambodia developed its own unique road map for its\nfinancial sector. The preliminary road map is a working draft to be amended and expanded as\nplans  and  ideas develop.  It  requires  regular and frequent  review  to adjust  the  tasks  and\ntimetable to meet the next implementation steps and potential resources of Cambodia.\n2. Objective 1: Legal and Regulatory Framework. This objective is to establish and\ndevelop the legal and regulatory framework necessary for a financial sector through (i) adopting\nlegislation that underpins the financial sector, (ii) adopting legislation that will build the capacity\nof the financial sector infrastructure, and (iii) promulgating regulations for the establishment and\nmaintenance of a safe and sound financial sector.\n3. Objective 2: Capacity Building. The second objective is to develop the capacity of\nindividuals  working  in  and  with  the  financial  sector  to  help  them  acquire  core  technical\ncompetency, through establishing formal training courses and/or institutions.\n4. Objective 3: Rural and Microfinance Development. The third objective is to develop a\nviable, pro-poor, and effective rural and microfinance system to provide access to institutional\nfinancial  services at equitable  terms  to  the  majority  for  sustainable  economic  growth  and\ndevelopment.\n5. Objective 4: Strengthening the Role of National Bank of Cambodia (NBC). The\nfourth objective is to promote confidence in the financial sector generally, and the banking\nsector specifically by strengthening NBC\u2019s capacity to design, adopt, and implement a program\nof prudential regulation and supervision.\n6. Objective 5: Financial Sector Institutional Strengthening. The fifth objective is to\npromote  stability  and  confidence  in  a  sustainable  financial  sector  through  developing  a\ncompetitive banking sector and developing market infrastructure to support new instruments\nand services.\n7. Objective 6: Expansion of Financial Sector Intermediation. The sixth objective is to\npromote stability and confidence in a sustainable financial sector through increasing resource\nmobilization and developing alternative sources of financing and investment through institutional\ndevelopment in (i) the capital market, (ii) the insurance sector, (iii) the pension sector, and (iv)\nother nonbanking financial institutions.\n8. Preliminary Road Map. The implementation of the strategy requires significant attention\nin light of the complexity and volume of tasks that are required. Timing and sequencing is crucial\nbecause many tasks rely on the completion of other tasks (prerequisites). The preliminary road\nmap  provides  the  details  for  the  anticipated  tasks  to  be  undertaken  by  the  Government,\nincluding (i) description of the tasks (total 776 tasks), (ii) the agency or ministry responsible for\neach task, (iii) current technical assistance being provided (if any), (iv) the name of a possible\n(Reference in text: page 1, footnote 1)", "7 Appendix 1, page 1\nfunding agency to assist the Government in completing the task, (v) date the task was last\nupdated or amended, (vi) remarks by the Government, and (vii) timing or expected time frame.\nThe road map will include (i) development of a legal land regulatory framework, (ii) capacity\nbuilding through training, (iii) rural and micro finance, (iv) strengthening of the roles of NBC, (v)\ndevelopment of the banking subsector, (vi) development of capital market, (vii) development of\nthe  insurance  subsector,  (viii)  development  of  the  pensions,  and  (ix)  development  of  the\nnonbank financial subsector.\n9. Most of the tasks (except for the restructuring of the Government offices) will need\nprivate sector involvement.", "8", "9", "10", "11", "12 Appendix 2, page 1\nBANKING SECTOR\nFigure 1: Total Banking Sector Assets as a Percentage of Gross Domestic Product\n180%\n162%\nP 160%\nD\nG\n140%\n \nf\no\n%  120% 109% 105%\n \na\n  100%\ns\na\n \ns 80%\nt\ne\ns 54%\ns 60%\nA 38%\n \nal 40% 28%\nt\no 15%\nT 20%\n0%\nEconomy Malaysia Thailand Philippines  Latvia VVieiet tNnaamm Lithuania Cambodia\nSources: Asian Development Bank, World Bank, Bank Negara Malaysia, Bank of Latvia, Bank of Thailand, Bank of\nLithuania, National Bank of Cambodia (31 December 1998)\nFigure 2: Composition of Money Supply\nValue (Riel million)\n1,400,000\n1,200,000\nBank Deposits in Riel\n1,000,000\n800,000\nBank Deposits in Foreign Currency\n600,000\n400,000\n200,000 Currency Outside of Banks\n-\n5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 7 7 7 7 8 8 8 8 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\nMar- Jun- Sep- Dec- Mar- Jun- Sep- Dec- Mar- Jun- Sep- Dec- Mar- Jun- Sep- Dec- Mar- Jun-\nSource: National Bank of Cambodia\n(Reference in text: page 2, para. 7)", "13 Appendix 2, page 2\nFigure 3: Trends in Bank Deposits, Loans, and Total Assets\nValue (Riel million)\n2,500,000\n2,000,000\n1,500,000\n1,000,000\n500,000\n0\n-\n1995 1996 1997 1998 1999\nDeposits Loans Total Assets\nSource: National Bank of Cambodia\nFigure 4: Trend in Banking Sector Loans by Industry\nValue (Riel million)\n200,000\n180,000\n160,000\n140,000\n120,000\n100,000\n80,000\n60,000\n40,000\n20,000\n-\n0\n1995 1996 1997 1998 1999\nWholesale & retail Services Manufacturing\nImport Real estate & public utilities Agriculture\nExport Finance Construction\nOthers\nSource: National Bank of Cambodia", "14 Appendix 3\nCOST ESTIMATES\n($)\nForeign  Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\n(a)\nA.
