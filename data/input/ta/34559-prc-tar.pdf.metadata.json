INTRODUCTION\n1. During the Mid-Term Review of the People's Republic of China (PRC) Country\nAssistance Plan in March 2001, the Government reconfirmed its request for a technical\nassistance (TA) to study legal issues arising from PRC\u2019s membership in the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) and asked that the processing of the TA be accelerated.  This\nrequest reflects PRC's anticipated accession to WTO and recognizes the urgent need to\nrevise existing laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and to adopt new ones to\nsatisfy WTO requirements.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) Fact-Finding Mission\nvisited Beijing from 27 November to 7 December 2000, and reached an agreement on\nthe objectives, scope, terms of reference, and cost for the TA.1  The TA framework is\nattached as Appendix 1.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. WTO  is  the  only  international  body  dealing  with  the  rules  of  trade  between\nnations.  At its heart are the WTO agreements, which are negotiated and signed by most\nof the world\u2019s trading nations and provide the legal ground rules for international trade.\n3. Before the birth of WTO in January 1995, the world trading system was governed\nby the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade  (GATT). Under GATT, eight rounds of\ntrade negotiations resulted in the reduction of tariffs, removal of nontariff barriers, trade\nliberalization, adoption of a comprehensive set of rules for trade of goods, and, most\nimportant, with the last round\u2013the Uruguay Round\u2013the creation of WTO.  GATT was\namended  and  incorporated  into  the  WTO  agreements  and  continues  in  existence,\ntogether with the new General Agreement on Trade in Services and Agreement on\nTrade-Related  Aspects  of  Intellectual  Property  Rights.    WTO  brings  all  these\nagreements  under  a  single  organization,  and  under  a  single  system  for  resolving\ndisputes.\n4. PRC is by far the largest trading nation that is not a member of WTO.  In the\nearly 1980s, PRC resumed its participation in GATT activities as an observer.  In July\n1987, PRC submitted its formal application for accession.  It participated in the Uruguay\nRound and after the creation of WTO, the unresolved issue of PRC's accession to GATT\nbecame an issue of accession to WTO. After PRC concluded bilateral agreements with\nits major trading partners, particularly the United States and the European Union in\n2000, negotiations for its accession to WTO moved into their final stage\u2013multilateral\nnegotiations under the auspices of WTO.  A substantive agreement on the multilateral\nnegotiations is expected to be finalized in 2001.  Following this, a protocol will be\nprepared to reflect all the agreements reached during the multilateral negotiations.  After\nit is reviewed and commented on by WTO members, the protocol is expected to be\nadopted formally in the second half of 2001 to confirm PRC's formal accession to WTO.\n5. Pending PRC\u2019s accession to WTO, a tremendous amount of work is required to\namend existing laws, regulations, and trade administrative practices and adopt new laws\n                                                \n1  The TA  first appeared in Asian Development Bank Business Opportunities in November 2000 as \u201cWTO\nMembership and Law Reform\u201d and was updated as  \u201cWTO Membership and Foreign Trade Law Reform\u201d.", "2\nand regulations to comply with WTO rules and obligations.  The relevant legislative\nagencies require considerable technical assistance to complete this work on time.\n6. The requirements for complying with WTO rules and obligations are derived from\ntwo major sources: (i) WTO rules governing international trade, which are applicable to\nall WTO members and will become binding on PRC immediately upon its accession to\nWTO; and (ii) PRC\u2019s commitments to its major trading partners to open markets in 3-5\nyears to foreign companies in various sectors, including telecommunications, distribution\nand wholesaling, financial services, and banking and insurance.\n7.  The Government is committed to change PRC\u2019s laws and regulations to comply\nwith WTO rules upon PRC's formal accession to WTO.  This includes codifying existing\nadministrative practices into written laws and regulations to increase predictability and\ntransparency. This demanding task will cover around 200 laws and regulations that need\nto be reviewed, revised, annulled, and/or incorporated into new laws or regulations.\n8. The  Ministry  of  Foreign  Trade  and  Economic  Cooperation  (MOFTEC)  is  in\ncharge  of  regulation  and  supervision  of  foreign  trade  and  direct  investment.    It  is\nempowered  to  promulgate  ministerial  regulations  regarding  foreign  trade  and\ninvestment. It is also responsible for preparing the initial drafts of legislation governing\nforeign trade and investment, which will be submitted to the National People's Congress\nfor adoption in the case of national laws and to the State Council in the case of the\nadministrative regulations.  As the front agency involved in PRC\u2019s negotiations to enter\nWTO  and  as  the  foreign-trade  administrator,  MOFTEC  is  primarily  responsible  for\nensuring that the draft foreign trade legislation is consistent with WTO rules.\n9. WTO\u2019s objectives are to use tariff as the only means to control imports and\nexports,  and  to  negotiate  between  nations  on  tariff  reduction.  To  ensure  the\neffectiveness of tariff concessions, nontariff barriers have to be eliminated. WTO rules\ndo, however, allow interventions to stop unfair competition practices such as dumping\nand subsidies, and permit the adoption of temporary protection measures for domestic\nmarkets and industries.\n10. Under PRC's central planning system, foreign trade was administered with both\ntariff and nontariff controls, including quantitative controls. WTO rules require PRC to\neliminate nontariff barriers and ensure compliance with tariff reduction obligations. In\nPRC foreign trade administration has been carried out according to a large number of\nministerial rules and administrative practices. Some rules are neither transparent nor\npredictable\u2013a problem that will be solved by codifying them into the revised Foreign\nTrade Law and new administrative regulations as consistent with WTO rules.\n11. PRC  will  also  be  obligated  to  increase  the  transparency,  predictability,  and\ncertainty of its legal rules.  To ensure their transparency and promote predictability, they\nmust be widely disseminated.  The Government is cognizant of this need and has\nrequested assistance for this purpose.\n12. PRC's entry into WTO and law reform will not only make PRC's foreign-trade\nlaws and administrative regime compatible with international law and practice, but will\nalso have a significant positive impact on governance, particularly in the creation of a\ntransparent and predictable legal regime.   Supporting this process is consistent with\nADB's strategic objective in PRC.", "3\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objectives\n13. The objectives of the TA are the following:\n(i)  Help  the  Government  make  its  foreign-trade  laws  and  regulations\ncompatible with WTO principles, rules, and obligations.\n(ii)  Help the Government determine the institutional set-up for regulating\nforeign trade and investment.\n(iii)  Support the Government's efforts (a) to increase transparency by making\nlegal information public and (b) to clarify laws and regulations on foreign-\ntrade and investment.\nB. Scope\n14. The TA will help the Government with the following:\n(i) modifying the Foreign Trade Law;\n(ii)  drafting regulations on (a) import and export of goods, (b) import and\nexport of technology, (c) commodity inspection, and (d) rules of origin;\n(iii)  developing regulations relating to trade in services, including (a) drafting\nregulations on transnational construction project, (b) drafting regulations\non transnational labor cooperation, and (c) undertaking research on legal\nissues related to electronic commerce;\n(iv)  developing regulations on transnational mergers and acquisitions, and\ntransnational franchising;\n(v)  preparing regulations on anti-dumping, subsidy and countervailing, and\nsafeguard measures and drafting implementing rules or guidelines;\n(vi)  increasing the transparency of laws and regulations on foreign trade and\ninvestment by strengthening the Government's capacity to provide legal\ninformation to the public and to clarify legal rules.\n15. The TA will include the following inputs:\n(i)  services of consultants who will review and comment on the draft laws\nand/or studies and reports on the topics as indicated in paragraph 14\nabove;\n(ii)  workshops, seminars, and international symposiums that will bring the\nbest international practice to the attention of PRC decision makers;", "4\n(iii)  external  study  tours  on  institutional  set-up  for  administration  of\ninternational trade; and\n(iv)  provision  of  equipment  that  will  improve  dissemination  of  legal\ninformation.\n16. Before  the  reform  of  foreign  trade  laws  inconsistencies  must  be  identified\nbetween  WTO  rules  and  existing  laws,  regulations,  and  administrative  practices.\nExperts will review and comment on draft legislation to ensure that revisions comply with\nWTO requirements and reflect PRC\u2019s status as a developing country. Research will be\nundertaken on the regulation of electronic commerce and foreign investment in the form\nof transnational mergers and acquisitions and franchising.\n17. After PRC\u2019s entry into WTO, it is expected that major functional and institutional\nchanges including restructuring of foreign trade administration system will have to be\nmade.  For example, the administration system will have to give up its functions of\nquantitative  regulation  of  imports  and  exports,  and  of  licensing,  supervision,  and\nregulation of specialized import and export companies.  However, the system will have\nto take on functions such as (i) participation in global-trade negotiations; (ii) adoption of\ndomestic rules that are consistent with WTO rules; and (iii) resolution of disputes  within\nPRC's jurisdiction, at the  bilateral level, and under WTO auspices.  In order to learn\nfrom  other  countries\u2019  experiences  and  practices  in  the  institutional  set-up  of\nadministration regimes governing foreign  trade and investment, a group of officials from\nMOFTEC, State Council\u2019s General Office and Office of the State Commission for Public\nService Structure and Establishment Administration will conduct a two-week external\nstudy visit to European countries.\n18. WTO requires that PRC designate a source (i) to provide an English version of\nlaws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment in a timely manner,2 (ii)\ndesignate a government agency to clarify laws on foreign trade and investment, and\nprovide mechanisms for hearing and deciding trade complaints and disputes.  MOFTEC\nis expected to be named as provider of the last two services.  The TA will provide\nequipment  to  (i)  strengthen  and  expand  the  information  dissemination  capability  of\nMOFTEC\u2019s  Department  of  Treaty  and  Law  through  MOFTEC\u2019s  web-site  and  (ii)\nstrengthen and improve the department\u2019s ability to convene meetings to clarify trade\nrules and regulations and to hold hearings on trade disputes.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n19. The TA\u2019s total cost is $956,000 equivalent, of which $470,000 is the foreign\nexchange cost and $486,000 equivalent is the local currency cost.  ADB will provide\n$700,000 on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program to finance the total foreign\ncurrency cost and $230,000 equivalent of the local currency cost.  ADB funds will\nfinance (i) international and domestic consulting services; (ii) cost of services of resource\npersons and distinguished speakers; (iii) cost of workshops, seminars and international\nsymposiums; (iv) support for surveys and investigations; (v) purchase of equipment; (vi)\n                                                \n2  A loose-leaf publication containing the English translation of foreign-related laws and regulations compiled\nby the Office of Legislative Affairs of the State Council has been developed with ADB\u2019s support under TA\nNo. 3000: Strengthening of the Legal Information System.  This publication, to be formally launched in\nJuly 2001, is expected to be designated as the source of legal information required by WTO.", "5\nconduct of external studies; (vii) conduct of comparative studies; and (viii) administrative\nand office costs.  The Government\u2019s contribution of $256,000 equivalent will cover the\ncost of (i) counterpart staff; (ii) offices for international and domestic consultants; (iii)\nsurveys  and  investigations;  (iv)  local  communications  and  transportation;  (v)\ninterpretation and translation; (vi) workshops, seminars, and international symposiums\n(partially); and (vii) general administration.  The detailed breakdown costs and financing\nplan for the TA is shown in Appendix 2.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n20. Services  of  international  (8  person-months)  and  domestic  consultants  (10\nperson-months)  will  be  required.    The  international  consultants  will  be  the  experts\nspecialized in WTO rules relating to the areas described in paragraph 14 (i) to (v). The\ndomestic  experts  will  have  expertise  in  WTO  rules  and  PRC  foreign  trade  law,\nregulations and administrative practices in the areas described in paragraph 14 (i) to (v).\nOther domestic experts (6 person-months) will carry out surveys and investigations on\nexisting  law  and  practice.

A conference\norganizer  will  be  engaged  to  organize  and  facilitate  the  workshops,  seminars  and\ninternational symposiums.  Prior to the undertaking of the external study tour, a proposal\nwill be submitted to ADB on the composition of the study tour group, itinerary and budget\nfor ADB\u2019s review and approval. The equipment to be provided for improving the legal\ninformation system and implementing the TA will be procured by the EA in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  An advance payment facility will be provided for\nthe equipment, external study, workshops, seminars, and international symposiums.\n21. MOFTEC will be the TA\u2019s Executing Agency (EA).  An Assistant Minister of\nMOFTEC will lead the TA\u2019s implementation.  A working group will be set up in MOFTEC,\nled by a project director who will be a senior official from the Department of Treaty and\nLaw.  The EA will coordinate the TA implementation with other relevant Government\nagencies  in  implementing  the  TA,  particularly  with  the  Customs  Administration,\nAdministration of Inspection of Goods and the Office of Legislative Affairs of the State\nCouncil.    MOFTEC  should  provide  the  international  and  domestic  consultants  and\nresource persons for their review and comment the draft of relevant laws and regulations\n(and  English  translation  thereof  for  foreign  experts),  and  where  required,  a  list  of\nquestions regarding such draft legislation and background information on the relevant\nlaws, regulations and practices. The TA implementation is expected to commence in\nJune 2001 and be completed in October 2002.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n22.
