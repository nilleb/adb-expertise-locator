INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  country  programming  mission  held  on  4\u20136  August  2015  in  Beijing,  the \nGovernment  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  confirmed  its  request  to  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for a new facility-type technical assistance (TA) project that will \nprovide flexible and timely response to emerging policy and capacity development needs during \n2016\u20132020. An important tool that enhances ADB's ability to respond quickly and flexibly, the \nfacility-type TA is also an important means to support and disseminate innovation, and serve \ndifferent objectives of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS) and PRC reform priorities.1 The \nproposed TA is the eighth facility-type TA project in the PRC.2 The first six of these projects \nhave been completed, while the Support for Deepening Policy Reform and Capacity Building \nproject is still ongoing but with its funds already fully committed. \n \n2.  Continuing  policy  recommendations  and  capacity  building  are  critical  for  the  PRC \ngovernment to quickly and effectively formulate and execute policies to address the economic \nand social development challenges under the \u201cnew normal.\u201d3 In addition, the implementation \nperiod of the proposed TA will coincide with the initial implementation period of the Thirteenth \nFive-Year Plan on National Economic and Social Development, 2016\u20132020.4 This TA also \nsupports the implementation of the country knowledge plan for the PRC in terms of knowledge \ngeneration and sharing.5 The TA fact-finding mission took place in May 2016, and an agreement \nwas  reached  with  the  executing  agency\u2014the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)\u2014on  the  impact, \noutcome, outputs, costs, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference (TOR). The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  While the PRC has made significant progress in overall economic growth since 1978, \nthe country still has considerable work to do to reach a moderately prosperous and harmonious \nsociety by 2020. Excessive reliance on investment, exports, and industrial development in the \npast has created imbalances and structural constraints, such as low factor productivity resulting \nfrom  overinvestment  and  excess  capacity,  growing  income  and  regional  disparities,  and \n                                                \n1  Independent Evaluation Department. 2015. Country Assistance Program Evaluation: People\u2019s Republic of China. \nManila: ADB. \n2  Seven facility-type TA projects have been approved since 2003: ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China for a Fund for Strategic Policy Conferences and Studies for Poverty Reduction. Manila (TA 4200, \n$400,000 approved on 21 October); ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the \nFacility for Policy Reform. Manila (TA 4365, $450,000, approved on 26 July); ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China for the Facility for Reform Support and Capacity Building. Manila (TA 4790, \n$500,000, approved on 22 May); ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the \nFacility for Policy Reform and Poverty Reduction. Manila (TA 4933, $900,000, approved on 28 May); ADB. 2009. \nTechnical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Facility for Policy Reform and Capacity Building III. \nManila (TA 7313, $1,200,000, approved on 20 July); ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina for Strengthening Institutional Reform and Capacity Building. Manila (TA 7862, $500,000, approved on \n9 September); and ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Support for Deepening \nPolicy Reform and Capacity Building. Manila (TA 8780, $800,000, approved on 3 December). \n3  The \u201cnew normal\u201d means that the Chinese economy has entered a new phase that is different from the high-speed \ngrowth pattern exhibited in the past. It is a new trend that features more sustainable, mid- to high-speed growth \nwith higher efficiency and lower costs. \n4  Government of the PRC, National Development and Reform Commission. 2015. Thirteenth Five-Year Plan on \nNational Economic and Social Development, 2016\u20132020. Beijing. \n5  ADB. 2016. Country Partnership Strategy: Transforming Partnership: People\u2019s Republic of China and Asian \nDevelopment  Bank,  2016\u20132020.  Manila.  The  country  knowledge  plan  is  accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2. \n6  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 20 May 2016. \n ", " 2\nenvironmental concerns. This led the government to question the soundness of the growth \nmodel. Under the \u201cnew normal,\u201d which focuses on quality rather than quantity of economic \ngrowth, the PRC\u2019s economy faces numerous challenges: declining factor productivity, widening \nincome inequality and urban\u2013rural gap, increasing environmental degradation and pollution, and \ngrowing resource constraints. Other constraints arise from economic rebalancing, the downside \nof  urbanization,  weak  institutional  capacity,  poor  policy  coordination  between  government \nagencies, and, above all, the need to restructure PRC institutions from being led by economic \ngrowth to becoming public-service-oriented entities that can respond to emerging problems. \n \n4.  The 13th plan, approved by the National People\u2019s Congress in March 2016, outlines a \npolicy  framework,  government  priorities,  and  economic  and  social  development  targets, \nincluding  medium\u2013high  economic  growth,  inclusive  and  innovation-driven  development, \necological civilization and green development, and the establishment of a modern social sector. \n \n5.  The  completed  facility-type  TA  projects  contributed  to  the  implementation  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s priority areas in previous five-year plans; enabled policy analyses on emerging, \nurgent issues; and strengthened the capacity of the executing and implementing agencies.7 \nBuilding on the success of and lessons learned from previous facility-type TA projects, the \nproposed TA will provide the PRC government with policy inputs, tools, and a forum to best \nrespond to the development challenges and achieve the targets of the 13th plan. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The  impact  will  be  the  formulation  of  an  effective  policy  for  implementing  key \nsocioeconomic development goals of the 13th plan, and capacity enhancement of relevant \ngovernment  agencies  based  on  timely  and  quality  policy  research  and  capacity-building \nprograms.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  will  be  policy  reforms,  strategies,  and  new  ideas  and \npractices introduced or recommended for adoption by relevant government agencies, along with \ncapacity building in priority areas. Indicators and performance targets are those that have been \nset out in the CPS and the 13th plan, particularly those related to inclusive and innovation-\ndriven development, ecological civilization and green development, and other key economic and \ndevelopment goals. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The TA will allow ADB to provide timely support for PRC reform processes and capacity \nbuilding, and its design provides a flexible framework, including allowing the selection of some \nsubprojects during TA implementation. Subprojects will be jointly selected to provide timely \n                                                \n7  Independent Evaluation Department. 2013. Performance Evaluation Report: People\u2019s Republic of China: Facility-\nType Technical Assistance. Manila: ADB. The report recommended that ADB continue to work with \u201cfacility-type\u201d \nTA and replicate such engagement in other member countries to increase goodwill for the wider ADB country \nportfolio.  The report also pointed out the main lessons from previous facility type TAs that need to be addressed in \nfuture TAs: the effectiveness of facility type TAs could be improved if consultant procurement time frames were \nshortened and if ADB could assign adequate staff to work simultaneously on multiple subprojects at various stages \nof the subproject cycle (design, processing, implementation, and monitoring of outputs and outcomes).  To improve \nthe effectiveness of the new facility type TA, the resident mission will (i) work closely with the Operations Services \nand Financial Management Department to shorten the consultant recruitment time frames; and (ii) administer the \nnew facility type TA, with counterparts from ADB headquarters contributing to and/or managing some subprojects \nsimultaneously at various stages of subproject design, processing, implementation and monitoring, based on their \ntechnical strengths and complementarity to other ADB programs.   \n ", "3 \nsupport to emerging government reform and capacity-building priorities in areas where ADB \ninvolvement  is  expected  to  have  substantial  impact  on  development,  refinement,  and/or \noperationalization of national policy; and which are consistent with the CPS and complementary \nto ADB lending and TA operations. Policy-related activities may include formulation and/or \namendment of policies, laws, and regulations; and the design or refinement of institutional \nstructures, operational procedures, and capacity-building mechanisms. \n \n8.  Output  1:  Policy  assessments  enhanced.  The  subprojects  under  this  output  will \nprovide  policy  advice  to  selected  central  and  provincial  government  agencies  on  priority \ndevelopment issues in different sectors and subjects to respond to emerging challenges and \nsupport  the  implementation  of  the  13th  plan,  and  in  other  priority  sectors  agreed  by  the \ngovernment and ADB. Activities will include research studies, policy dialogue, and stakeholder \nconsultation through meetings, workshops, and conferences. The indicative allotment for this \noutput is $600,000. \n \n9.  Output  2:  Capacity  building  in  selected  agencies/areas  strengthened.  The \nsubprojects  under  this  output  will  allow  to  strengthen  the  development  and  management \ncapacity of selected central and provincial government agencies through capacity assessments, \ntraining programs, workshops, conferences, and knowledge management interventions. The \nindicative allotment for this output is $200,000. \n \n10.  The PRC  Resident  Mission  and  MOF  will jointly  screen  and  select  subprojects  for \nfunding under these two outputs according to a set of pre-identified selection criteria. The \ncriteria for selecting policy-related subprojects require that a subproject (i) supports priority \ngovernment policy reforms and local innovations, consistent with the CPS; (ii) aligns with the \nimplementation of the 13th plan; (iii) considers emerging, urgent, and high-priority issues where \nADB can potentially add considerable value; and (iv) shows evidence of strong PRC ownership, \nsuch that a small amount of strategic ADB assistance will help push forward or better actualize \nimportant reforms and/or leverage the outcome and impact of existing projects. Priority will be \ngiven to capacity-building subprojects that support cooperation between the PRC and ADB in \naddressing the key development constraints highlighted in para. 3. \n \n11.  The indicative subprojects identified for output 1 include: (i) Social Work Services Policy \nand Delivery Modes for Migrant Children in the PRC, which aims to develop standards for social \nwork services for migrant children in the PRC ($100,000); (ii) Study on the Construction of \nScientific and Technological Innovation Center Promoted by the Enhancement of Science and \nTechnology  Parks,  which  aims  to  facilitate  the  construction  of  a  science  and  technology \ninnovation center in Shanghai ($100,000); (iii) Integrated Resource Conservation Project\u2014A \nCase Study in Tianjin, which aims to build a recycling economy and a demonstration base for \necological civilization in Tianjin ($100,000); and (iv) Study of the Key Issues in Legislating the \nPRC\u2019s Futures Market, which aims to promote the development and legislation of the futures \nmarket in the PRC ($100,000). \n \n12.  Throughout the 3-year implementation period, additional subprojects are expected to be \nincluded under the proposed TA. The selection criteria of new subprojects will follow those \nspecified in para. 10. Periodic meetings between ADB and MOF will be held to update the list of \nsubprojects and core outputs. A memorandum of understanding between ADB and MOF will be \nsigned to record the agreement on additional subprojects. The resident mission country director \nwill seek MOF\u2019s concurrence on the updated TA subproject list, attaching the memorandum of \nunderstanding as recorded, including (i) an updated list of subprojects with detailed project \ndesigns and specific TORs, and (ii) reports on the implementation progress of all TA subprojects. \n ", " 4\nThe first meeting between ADB and MOF will be held immediately after TA approval to finalize \narrangements and timetables for first-round activities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $1,000,000, of which ADB will provide an \nequivalent  of  $800,000  on  a  grant  basis  under ADB\u2019s  Technical Assistance  Special  Fund \n(TASF-other sources). The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office \nvenue and supplies, counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2, and estimated budgets for indicative initial subprojects are \nnoted above. Subsequent subprojects will be subject to a maximum of $100,000 each, unless \nthis ceiling is waived by ADB and MOF. \n \n14.  Subprojects  may  also  fund  surveys,  field  investigations,  the  purchase  of  required \nresearch materials, and other related expenditures under output 1 on the basis of cost estimates \nagreed by ADB in advance. In line with standard ADB procedures, the TA will not support \nimplementing agencies\u2019 management fees, overhead expenses, or related costs such as staff \nsalaries and allowances; and the use of implementing agencies\u2019 resources (such as office \naccommodation), which will be provided as part of the counterpart contribution. The support for \nworkshops under output 2 may include costs related to venue and equipment rental; translation \nand/or  interpretation;  material  editing,  copying,  printing,  and/or  dissemination;  food  and \nnonalcoholic beverages; transportation; lodging; logistics and administrative support; and other \nexpenditures with prior approval from ADB. Recruitment of consultants will be undertaken in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime).  The  proceeds  of  the TA  will  be  disbursed  in  line  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented from 20 July 2016 through 19 June 2019. MOF will be the \nexecuting agency for the TA and will be responsible for oversight and coordination of subproject \nactivities. ADB will closely monitor the implementation progress and record the status of each \nsubproject monthly or as needed. To ensure strong coordination, ADB and MOF will meet \nquarterly or as needed to review progress and discuss candidates for additional subprojects, \nassess  core  outputs,  and  ensure  effective  dissemination.  In  coordination  with  MOF  and \nimplementing  agencies,  ADB  will  produce  the  implementation  progress  report  for  each \nsubproject quarterly. \n \n16.  Throughout the 3-year implementation period, ADB and MOF will continuously accept \nsubproject  proposals  from  government  organizations,  various  institutions,  nongovernment \norganizations, and, in special cases, a unit within ADB or MOF. Based on the proposed TA \ndesign and selection criteria, ADB and MOF will jointly agree on subprojects to be included in \nthe  TA,  and  on  the  responsible  implementing  agencies.  For  each  agreed  subproject,  the \nimplementing agency will take overall responsibility for ensuring coordination and the quality \nand timeliness of output delivery. It will identify one focal point to provide working-level inputs \nthroughout the subproject, including (i) liaising with ADB, MOF, and additional key actors and \ndecision makers to support implementation and policy dialogue; (ii) identifying, proposing to \nADB and MOF, and coordinating with external subproject experts all activities, specific written \ninputs, and review of key draft reports; and (iii) proposing to ADB and MOF any changes \nneeded in subproject scope or approaches based on discussion with the experts. \n \n ", "5 \n17.  ADB staff will monitor, and in some cases directly contribute to, TA progress and outputs, \nand will conduct policy discussions with relevant government agencies. The resident mission \nwill  administer  the  TA,  with  counterparts  from  ADB  headquarters  contributing  to  and/or \nmanaging some subprojects, based on their technical strengths and complementarity to other \nADB programs. \n \n18.  ADB  will  work  with  the  government  to  identify  national  (58  person-months)  and \ninternational (12 person-months) specialists to provide inputs as individual consultants, resource \npersons, and task-specific experts. ADB will endorse the required expertise and the TOR, \nincluding the duration and expected results, at the time of joint identification of subprojects or \nduring implementation. In dialogue with MOF and/or relevant implementing agencies, ADB will \nrecruit consultants in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. Additional resource \npersons and task-specific experts will carry out well-defined tasks (e.g., case study papers, \nworkshop presentations, and review of draft reports). TA projects involving more than three \nconsultants  should  typically  use  firm-based  recruitment;  but  given  the  need  for  flexibility, \nresponsiveness, and timeliness, as well as the fact that a sizable portion of TA activities and \nexpert inputs cannot be identified at the time of processing, this requirement will be waived. \n \n19.   ADB will disburse funds linked to other activity expenditures based on costed work \nplans submitted by the implementing agency and jointly reviewed by MOF. Unless otherwise \nagreed,  funds  will  be  disbursed  directly  to  the  implementing  agencies.  In  all  cases,  the \nimplementing agencies will provide documentation to liquidate actual expenditures to ADB in \naccordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). To facilitate implementation, ADB may establish an advance payment facility for \nMOF  and  the  implementing  agencies  as  needed  and/or  utilize  direct  payments  (e.g.,  to \nworkshop venues). The resident mission will provide an orientation to ensure clarity on related \nprocedures. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China for the Facility for Strengthening Policy Reform and Capacity \nBuilding project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n Impact the TA is Aligned with \nEffective policy formulation for implementing key socioeconomic development goals of the Thirteenth \nFive-Year Plan and capacity enhancement of relevant government agencies realized (Thirteenth Five-\nYear Plan on National Economic and Social Development, 2016\u20132020)a \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By 2020     \n       \nPolicy reforms,  a.
