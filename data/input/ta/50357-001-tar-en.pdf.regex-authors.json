INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the development of \npolicy frameworks for accelerating the reform of application-oriented undergraduate programs at \nlocal universities in Yunnan Province through research, capacity development, and policy advice \nto promote socioeconomic development and regional cooperation with Southeast Asian countries.  \n \n2.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested the TA from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) as part of its efforts to rationalize the higher education system in \nYunnan Province to fill critical skills gaps in local and regional labor markets. Following a mission \nin March 2018, ADB and the government reached an understanding on the TA objectives, scope, \nimplementation arrangements, costs, and terms of reference for consultants.1 The TA is included \nin ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for the PRC, 2018\u20132020.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The PRC\u2019s higher education system\u2014the largest in the world in terms of number of higher \neducation institutions (HEIs) and students\u2014has been growing rapidly, contributing to remarkable \neconomic growth.3 Yet as the economy has continued to undergo fundamental transformation \nand its growth has slowed, structural issues with the PRC\u2019s higher education system have \nbecome more prominent. These include homogenization of colleges and universities, the difficulty \ngraduates  face  in  finding  a  job,  and  insufficient  capacity  of  HEIs  for  innovation  and \nentrepreneurship.  Against  this  background,  the  Ministry  of  Education  issued  guidelines  for \nprovincial governments to rationalize the higher education system by establishing a system for \nclassifying HEIs, and to transform some local colleges and universities to offer application-\noriented  undergraduate  programs,  which  integrate  discipline-oriented  education  and \nprofessionally oriented practical training through university\u2013enterprise cooperation and meet the \nneeds of local socioeconomic development.4 At the same time, research universities were guided \nto enhance global competitiveness and state-of-the-art disciplines.5  \n \n4.  Bordering the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam, Yunnan \nProvince forms part of the PRC\u2019s poor and underdeveloped western region. Its higher education \nsystem, comprising 79 HEIs (77 colleges and universities, and 2 adult education colleges), has \nbeen unbalanced in its capacity to meet the needs of local socioeconomic development, and \ngraduates face difficulties in finding a job. When the Yunnan Provincial Department of Education \n(PDE) initiated the reform of application-oriented undergraduate programs in 2008, HEIs in \nYunnan Province were undifferentiated from each other in programs they offered, particularly due \nto the upgrading of many 3-year colleges to 4-year colleges and universities (local universities) \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 April 2018.  \n2  ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2018\u20132020. Manila. The TA title has \nbeen adjusted to better reflect its objective.   \n3  According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the PRC added almost one HEI per \nweek in 2010\u20132013 (51 in 2010, 33 in 2011, and 49 in 2013). http://www.oecd.org/education/skills-beyond-\nschool/andreasschleicher-highereducationstakeholderforum2016-opening.htm.  \n4  The completion of a 4-year application-oriented undergraduate program would lead to a bachelor\u2019s degree. An \napplication-oriented undergraduate program differs from a 3-year technical and vocational education and training \nprogram, graduates from which would receive a diploma.

Since then, Yunnan PDE has pursued a series of reforms to align the higher education \nsystem with skills needs of local and regional labor markets. For example, in 2014, ahead of the \nMinistry of Education\u2019s guidelines, Yunnan PDE started to pilot the reform of application-oriented \nundergraduate programs at nine local universities.6 In 2016, it introduced an HEI classification \nsystem to comprehensively reform the higher education system,7 while it has started to develop \nworld-class universities in 2018.8 Moreover, Yunnan Province strives to promote international \ncooperation in higher education, with an emphasis on cooperation with Southeast Asian countries \nunder the Belt and Road Initiative. \n \n5.  All  local  universities  are  guided  to  implement  the  reform  of  application-oriented \nundergraduate programs in Yunnan Province. Despite their achievements, the pilot reforms have \nencountered challenges and issues, including  \n(i)  difficulties with fully adapting professionally oriented majors and clusters (groups \nof majors) to the needs of local industries, due in part to time lag between the pace \nof industry transformation and upgrading and that of curriculum, teaching force, \nand training materials and facility development and upgrading, and to insufficient \nuniversity\u2013enterprise cooperation; \n(ii)  inadequate university entrance exam system based on discipline-oriented majors \nand graduation exam system based on thesis, as opposed to the emphasis on \nprofessionally oriented practical training in application-oriented undergraduate \nprograms; \n(iii)  underdeveloped capacity for training human resources to promote cooperation \nwith Southeast Asian countries and implement the Belt and Road Initiative;  \n(iv)  limited public funds to develop practical training, innovation, and entrepreneurship \nfacilities;  \n(v)  constraints  on  the  autonomy  of  local  universities,  particularly  that  of  public \nuniversities, to seek funding other than from the government; and \n(vi)  unclear legal rights and obligations of the parties involved in university\u2013enterprise \ncooperation.  \n \n6.  These challenges and issues are compounded by a lack of policy frameworks at the \nnational and provincial levels for different types of universities (public, private, independent \nschools, and institutes subordinate to universities) that are coordinated with other policy areas to \naccelerate the reform of application-oriented undergraduate programs at local universities.  \n \nIII.

Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n8.  Output 1: Status of the reform of application-oriented undergraduate programs at \nlocal universities assessed. The TA will support the compilation of data and information11 on  \n31 local universities in Yunnan Province into a report that examines the original and current status \nof  the  universities  and  their  reforms  of  application-oriented  undergraduate  programs. 12 \nWorkshops will be organized to discuss with local university administrators; professional, industry, \nand government experts; and other relevant stakeholders the objective, methodology, and tools \nof data and information collection; and achievements and challenges in the reform of application-\noriented undergraduate programs. The report will be presented for discussion at a review \nworkshop and distribution to local universities.  \n \n9.  Output  2:  Good  practices  and  lessons  on  the  reform  of  application-oriented \nundergraduate  programs  documented  and  disseminated.  The  TA  will  support  the \ndevelopment of case studies and identification of good practices and lessons on the following five \nkey elements of the reform of application-oriented undergraduate programs at local universities: \n(i) development of majors and clusters to meet and anticipate the needs of local industries in the \nprocess of transformation and upgrading; (ii) integration of discipline-oriented education and \nprofessionally  oriented  practical  training  through  university\u2013enterprise  cooperation;                        \n(iii) establishment, management, and operation of research and development centers, practical \ntraining  centers,  and  technology  and  innovation  support  centers;  (iv)  application-oriented \nundergraduate  programs  to  promote  cooperation  with  Southeast  Asian  countries;  and                       \n(v) governance mechanisms for engaging  industries and enterprises in application-oriented \nundergraduate programs. Based on the report on the status of the reform at local universities \n(output 1) and in consultation with local universities; professional, industry, and government \nexperts; and other relevant stakeholders, eight case study universities, including three advanced \nuniversities in the eastern region of the PRC, will be selected to develop case studies of reforms \nof application-oriented undergraduate programs. Small workshops will be organized at the eight \nselected universities to develop case studies. In addition, tracer studies of graduates from \napplication-oriented undergraduate programs at the case study universities will be conducted. \nThe eight case studies will be compiled into a case study report and will be further analyzed to \nidentify good practices and lessons on the five key elements of the reform of application-oriented \nundergraduate programs to be documented in the form of five thematic reports. The case study \nreport and thematic reports will be presented for discussion at review workshops and distribution \nto local universities.  \n \n10.  Output  3:  Policy  recommendations  on  accelerating  the  reform  of  application-\noriented  undergraduate  programs  at  local  universities  in  line  with  local  industry \ntransformation and upgrading plans developed. The TA will support the review of (i) legal and \n                                                \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n11 The data and information may include the year of establishment, governance structure, list of faculties, faculty \nstructure, undergraduate majors, number of students, graduate employment status, number and qualifications of \nteachers, practical training facilities, research and development activities, innovation and entrepreneurship facilities, \nassets, finances, strategic plans, and reform activities.  \n12 A total of 31 local universities, including the 9 local universities that started pilot reforms in 2014, are listed in the \n2017 annual higher education report of Yunnan PDE. They have different ownership structures (public, private, \nindependent schools, and institutes subordinate to universities) and reporting requirements to provincial or municipal \ngovernments. Yunnan PDE does not have a comprehensive set of data and information. Yunnan PDE. 2018. Annual \nReport on Higher Education Transformation and Development.

The TA will also support the review of the status of Yunnan Province\u2019s pillar industries \nand the determination of their growth trajectories, which will indicate the needs for highly skilled \nhuman resources. In addition, international study visits to foreign universities that are advanced \nin application-oriented undergraduate programs will be organized. Based on the reviews and \nfindings from the international study visits as well as good practices and lessons (output 2), policy \nrecommendations on accelerating the reform of application-oriented undergraduate programs at \ndifferent types of local universities will be developed into a policy note. The policy note will be \npresented for discussion at a review workshop and submission to Yunnan Provincial Government.  \n \n11.  The key risk to the achievement of the outcome is that contradictory policies adopted in \nother policy areas (e.g., tax policy, intellectual property policy) may slow the reform of application-\noriented undergraduate programs at local universities. The major risk to the development of the \nthree outputs, especially output 3, is that the cooperation of local industries and enterprises may \nnot be maintained.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items \nare  listed  in  Appendix  2.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart staff, meeting facilities, data, information, relevant documents, and other in-kind \ncontributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will administer the TA. ADB will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants during \nimplementation of the TA. Yunnan PDE will be the executing and implementing agency and will \nbe responsible for providing guidance and support to the consultants engaged under the TA and \ninvolving all relevant stakeholders during TA implementation, including local universities; and \nprofessional, industry, and government experts. A project steering committee, chaired by the \ndirector of the foreign capital utilization division of Yunnan PDE, and comprising directors of higher \neducation  and  other  relevant  divisions  of  Yunnan  PDE,  and  representatives  from  Yunnan \nProvincial Department of Finance, universities, and professional and industry associations, will \nbe  established  to  provide  overall  implementation  guidance  and  support.  Relevant  local \nuniversities will appoint focal persons to communicate and coordinate with the consultants. Case \nstudy universities in Yunnan Province will establish working groups to develop case studies \ntogether with the consultants.  \n \n14.
