THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \n \nA.  Overall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n \n1.  The knowledge and support KI 2021\u20132023 TA cluster was approved in November 2019, \nwith an overall implementation from 1 September 2020 to 31 December 2024. Subproject 1 will \nbe implemented from 1 September 2020 to 30 June 2022; Subproject 2, from 1 October 2021 to \n30 June 2023; and Subproject 3, from 1 October 2022 to 31 December 2024.  \n \nB.  Subproject Outcome \n \n2.  The TA will have the following outcome: use of Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific data \nand analysis for evidence-based policymaking by DMC officials and economic researchers \nsustained. Subproject 1 will support the outputs of the overall TA cluster, as it will support \nproduction of the Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2021 (KI 2021); the KI 2021 Special \nSupplement;1 Basic statistics 2021; the updating of KI Database (KIDB), Portal for Statistics \nResources (Statistics Portal), and AsiaData; and dissemination activities of the KI 2021 data.  \n \nC.  Subproject Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n3.  Output 1: Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2021 and Basic Statistics 2021 \nfinalized and published. The TA will support the production of KI 2021 that will entail compiling \nupdated statistical tables and updating the KIDB on regional member countries through data \ncollection activities from national and international statistical partners and ADB sources.2 The \npublication is intended to serve as a resource for information related to the development issues \nconfronting ADB regional members. It presents a comprehensive set of economic, financial, social, \nenvironmental, and selected statistical indicators of the SDGs through its country tables, regional \ntables  in  eight  broad  themes  (people;  economy  and  output;  money,  finance,  and  prices; \nglobalization; transport and communication; energy and electricity; environment; and government \nand governance), and the SDG tables by goal. It also covers global value chains (GVC) statistics, \nwhich show how the economies in Asia and the Pacific continue to strengthen, broaden, and \ndiversify their participation in global production networks. KI 2021 will be disseminated digitally in \ncoordination with ADB\u2019s Department of Communications (DOC) via the ADB website and the new \nKIDB. Its impact will be monitored through the usual download metrics but adding more granularity \nas well as through new parameters that consider new ways of disseminating information, which \nwill be discussed with DOC and/or the Office of Information Systems and Technology (OIST). As \nit is also intended as a reference for ADB Management and operations, dissemination of KI 2021 \nwill also cater to internal clients to create awareness on available statistical information on ADB \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs). Moreover, while digital publication will be the main form \nof dissemination, a limited number of printed copies (around 400) will be produced for promotional \nor awareness-raising purposes and to meet requests of some specific groups for KI data as well \nas internal requests. This output is in line with output 1 of the TA cluster. \n \n \n1  There will be two special supplements for Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2021 discussing emergent \ndevelopment issues in Asia and the Pacific. The first supplement is envisioned to be released in time with the launch \nof the Key Indicators main publication while the second will be released on a different date after the launch. \n2  The statistical partners referred to in the TA report are the Key Indicators data sources in ADB DMCs to which the \nKey Indicators questionnaires are sent. These are the government agencies in the DMCs that provide official \nstatistics for the Key Indicators publication. They could be the ministry or department of finance, the central bank, \nthe national statistical office, and other relevant government agencies.  \n ", "2 \n4.  The TA will also support the production of Basic Statistics 2021 (BS 2021). Basic Statistics \npresents current data for ADB DMCs on core and selected economic, environmental, and social \nindicators used globally to track progress toward the SDGs. It is intended to serve as a handy and \ncomprehensive source of snapshot information on ADB\u2019s DMCs. As in the past editions, BS 2021 \nwill be available digitally on the ADB website and will also be accessible using mobile technology. \nA limited number of printed copies (1,500 to 2,500) will be produced for internal use of ADB \nManagement and staff and for consumption of the general public. Basic Statistics is also used by \nADB for awareness-raising events, which help promote the profile of ADB as a knowledge center \nin Asia and the Pacific. \n \n5.  Output 2: Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2021 special supplements finalized \nand published.3 The TA will support the preparation of two special supplements in 2021. The \nfocus of the first will be on measuring the contribution of digitally-enabled productive activities to \nthe total economy. This technical study will cover the development of statistical concepts and \nmethods related to the measurement of digital economy and synthesize commissioned papers on \nthe subject by economists and statisticians. The second supplement will study the state and \nevolution of global value chain participation by selected DMCs, and the economic effects of such \nparticipation, using multi-sourced data and cutting-edge analytical methods. The draft outlines \nand contents of the special supplements will be presented to ERCD and other departments for \ninput and feedback. Output 2 is in line with output 2 of the TA cluster.  \n \n6.  Output 3: Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific, Portal for Statistics Resources, \nand AsiaData mobile application updated. With the release of the new user-friendly KIDB in \nSeptember 2019, accessing information on ADB\u2019s regional members is more convenient and \ninteractive. The TA will support the continuous enhancement of the database to keep up with the \ndemands of users and with changes in technology. KIDB will be updated based on statistics and \ndata stories produced from KI 2021. It will be available on the ADB website through KI\u2019s landing \npage or directly at https://kidb.adb.org/kidb/. This output supports output 3 of the TA cluster. \n \n7.  The TA will support the maintenance and regular updating of the Portal for Statistics \nResources, also known as the Statistics Portal that is available internally within ADB.4 The portal \noffers a systematic structure for organizing and disseminating the in-house statistics resources in \nADB, e.g., databases and micro-level survey data sets procured by ERCD and other departments \nin ADB. It provides data support and information regarding data availability and resources that \nare useful for research activities of ADB or for formulating policy recommendations. It provides \ninformation on how to access or procure statistics resources that are not available within ADB or \nthat cannot be obtained through the internet.  \n \n8.  Updating the AsiaData mobile application\u2014a visualization tool for mobile devices that \npresents the latest macroeconomic and social indicators for ADB's regional members\u2014will be \nsupported by the TA. The application allows users free access to data and allows them to easily \nconstruct their own graphs and tables using any of the over 200 featured indicators for ADB \nregional members. Users can readily compare countries for one indicator or compare trends of \none indicator for a country. Similar to ready-made graphs, user-defined graphs can be saved or \nshared, and corresponding data tables can also be shown. The application is available for Android \nand Apple operating systems. Upgrading the application will require information technology (IT) \nexpertise. \n \n \n3  The topics will be cleared with ERCD management. \n4  https://statistics.adb.org/statresource/ \n ", "3 \n9.  Output 4: Workshops for knowledge sharing and dissemination conducted. KI 2021 \npublication and data will be disseminated via web launch and/or launch events.5 It will include key \nresults and data stories about Asia and the Pacific that are based on the data included in KI 2021. \nKnowledge-sharing activities will also be conducted for the special supplements, on KI as a data \nproduct to increase awareness about the publication and the KIDB, on the Statistics Portal, and \non AsiaData. Output 4 of subproject 1 supports output 4 of the TA cluster. \n \nD.  Subproject Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA subproject is estimated to cost $800,000, which will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($400,000 under TASF 6 and $400,000 under TASF \nOthers). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \nE.  Subproject Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  ADB will administer the TA through the Statistics and Data Innovation Unit of the Office of \nthe Chief Economist and Director General (EROD-SDI). EROD-SDI will coordinate with other ADB \nunits (regional and other departments, resident missions, and sector and thematic groups) and \nstatistical partners in ADB regional members in undertaking the TA activities. Subproject 1 will be \nimplemented  over  22  months\u2014from  September  2020  to  June  2022.  EROD-SDI  will  be \nresponsible for consultant recruitment and management and procurement of IT equipment that \nmay be needed. ADB will administer the TA. For the launch events and dissemination workshops, \nthe TA will provide for staff acting as resource persons in the workshops. \n \n12.

Consulting services. The preparation of the statistical tables of KI 2021 will entail \nsignificant inputs from time-based national consultants selected via individual selection process. \nAn estimated 176 person-months of national consultancy inputs would be required to prepare the \nstatistical tables of KI 2021, update the indicators for BS 2021, work on updating the GVC \nstatistics,  update  and  enhance  KIDB  and  the  Statistics  Portal,  and  prepare  the  graphics \nrequirements of the final outputs. For updating of AsiaData mobile application, a firm will be \nengaged via quality-and cost-based selection method. An estimated 6 person-months of output-\nbased and time-based international consultancy inputs will be needed for writing the statistical \ncommentaries  for  KI,  editing,  providing  IT-related  advice  and  support  for  KI,  and  writing \ncommissioned papers for the topic on the special supplement. ADB will engage the consultants \nfollowing the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated \nproject administration instructions and/or staff instructions.6  \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s procurement. Statistical and other software, survey data sets, data subscriptions, \nand IT equipment will be procured under the TA as needed and in coordination with OIST for IT-\nrelated procurement. Survey data sets, e.g., labor force survey data sets, will be procured \ndepending on needs of research work in EROD-SDI and other divisions in ERCD subject to the \nitem allocation in the TA\u2019s cost estimates and financing plan. This will also include subscriptions \nto special databases that are used as source of information for special studies in ERCD. IT \nequipment will be procured based on needs determined during TA implementation. Procurement \nwill follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the associated \nstaff instructions.  \n \n15.  Social media and websites. The contents of KI 2021 and related knowledge products \nwill be prominently disseminated via the ADB website through the dedicated KI publication site,7 \nKI landing page,8 and the KIDB as well as on social media in coordination with DOC. Since the \nKI landing page is part of the ADB website, its maintenance will be coordinated in collaboration \nwith DOC. EROD-SDI will be responsible for the maintenance of the KIDB in collaboration with \nOIST and DOC. A news release of KI 2021 launch will be prepared and published on the ADB \nwebsite.
