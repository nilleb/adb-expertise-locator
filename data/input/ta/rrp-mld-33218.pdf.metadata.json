The summary IEE is in Appendix 7.  \n   \nProject Description  The Project was developed within the context of the Government's \n6th National Development Plan, and focuses on poverty reduction; \ncommunity  development;  and  improvements  in  water  supply, \nsanitation  services,  solid  waste  management,  and  land \nmanagement. The Project combines the three principal thrusts of \npolicy improvements, capacity building, and investment facilities. \nThe Project will be implemented on three focus islands (Naifaru-\nLhaviyani, Mahibadhoo-Alif Dhaal, and Fonadhoo-Laamu atolls). \nNaifaru and Fonadhoo islands were reported to have been highly \nimpacted  by  the  2004  tsunami.  The  Project  will  help  the \nGovernment  deliver  basic  infrastructure  services  to  the  outer \nislands  more  efficiently  through  institutional  reform,  and  will \nconsolidate  systems  to  recover  costs  and  provide  waste  and \nsanitation  management  services.  The  Project  has  a  strong \ncommunity-based  approach  to  implementation  and  will  provide \ntangible support to optimize participation of the private sector by \nestablishing cooperatives for operation and maintenance. \n   \nRationale  Poverty in the Maldives stems primarily from regional disparities in \nliving conditions related to remoteness of the islands and lack of \ninfrastructure  and  social  services  in  the  atolls.  The  island \necosystems  are  among  the  most  vulnerable,  and  suffer  rapid \ndepletion  and  pollution  of  groundwater,  pollution  of  the  coastal \nenvironment due to inadequate sewage and solid waste disposal, \nand  marine  resource  depletion.  Environmental  degradation  can \nrender an island uninhabitable, increase its vulnerability to natural \ndisasters, and impact on key economic sectors, particularly tourism \nand fisheries. Problem analysis reveals that (i) basic infrastructure \nis largely inadequate on the outer islands to provide safe drinking \nwater, and to prevent groundwater, marine and terrestrial pollution, \nand health hazards; (ii) regional planning is deficient due to the \nabsence of implementing basic instruments such as land-use and \neconomic planning, and environmental management for resource \nprotection and health preservation; and (iii) management capacity \nat the regional, atoll, and island levels requires strengthening.  ", "iv   \nObjective  The Project\u2019s goal is to increase the standard of living in the \nCentral  Regions.  The  Project\u2019s  objective  is  to  improve \nenvironmental  and  land  management  through  a  community-\ncentered  approach.  The  Project  has  three  closely  interrelated \ncomponents:  (i) improving  environmental  infrastructure;  (ii) \nstrengthening planning and environmental management; and (iii) \nbuilding management and implementation capacity in the Central \nRegions. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  physical  and  price \ncontingencies, is estimated at $7.5 million equivalent. Of the total \ncost, $5.38 million (71%) comprises the foreign exchange cost, \nand $2.12 million equivalent (29%) the local currency cost.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a loan of $6 \nmillion equivalent from its Asian Development Fund resources. \nADB will finance 80% of the costs, including the entire foreign \nexchange  cost  and  29%  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The \nGovernment and the beneficiaries will finance the remaining $1.5 \nmillion equivalent of local costs. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $6 million from the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) \nSpecial Funds resources will be provided. The loan will have a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest \ncharge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe Loan Agreement. The Borrower will be the Government of \nMaldives. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 March 2011 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 September 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The  project  implementation  period  is  5  years.  A  project \nArrangements  management unit (PMU) under the Ministry of Atolls Development \n(MOAD) will be set up in Mal\u00e9, and three project implementation \nunits (PIUs) will be set up on each of the three project focus \nislands. A national project steering committee will be established \nto  guide  policy  decisions  and  operational  issues.  A  regional \nproject  advisory  committee  will  be  established  on  each  of  the \nfocus islands to advise on atoll development coordination. Close \ncoordination  with  units  working  on  tsunami  recovery  will  be \nsought. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Finance and Treasury \n   ", "  v\nProcurement  Goods, related services, and civil works to be financed from the \nloan proceeds will be procured in accordance with Guidelines for \nProcurement  by  the  ADB  and  its  Borrowers  and  Government \nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB. Procurement will be \ncarried out by the PIUs under the PMU\u2019s guidance. The sanitation \nschemes will be integrated into combined design and supervision, \nand  supply  and  construction  packages  for  international \ncompetitive  bidding.  Equipment  packages  valued  at  $500,000 \nequivalent or less will be procured following international shopping \nprocedures acceptable to ADB, and packages valued at $100,000 \nequivalent or less will be under direct purchasing procedures. Civil \nworks  contracts  for  the  catchment  rehabilitation  under  the \nrainwater tank component for values less than $15,000 equivalent \nwill  follow  ADB's  Guide  on  Community  Participation  in \nProcurement. \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will require 141 person-months\u2019 consulting services \n(61  international,  and  80  domestic).  Consulting  services  are \nrequired to facilitate project implementation and to strengthen the \ninstitutional, administrative, and financial capacities of the PMU \nand PIUs. One consulting firm will provide services for the PMU \nand  PIUs.  The  loan-financed  consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by the ADB \nand  its  Borrowers  using  a  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement of domestic consultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will directly benefit 9,500 people on the three focus \nBeneficiaries  islands, raising the standard of living by providing basic needs. \nMore than 20,000 people in the Lhaviyani, Alifu Dhaal, and Laamu \natolls  are  expected  to  benefit  from  solid  waste  management \nimprovements, and approximately 100,000 people in the central \nregional growth centers will benefit from improved planning and \nenvironmental management and improved institutional capacity to \nimplement  the  regional  development  program.  The  proposed \nsanitation and sewerage improvements will significantly reduce \npollution on the focus islands and their immediate surroundings, \nand will provide a proven mechanism for easy replication on other \nislands.  Improved  solid  waste  management  will  provide \nsustainable  solid  waste  collection  and  disposal,  and  reduce \ncoastal and marine pollution. A higher quality of life will result from \nbetter environmental management. These schemes will potentially \nenhance public health by reducing the risk of contracting diarrheal \nand  waterborne  diseases.  Community  participation  will  benefit \nvulnerable groups and allow women to be active in solid waste \nmanagement. Poor households will be encouraged to participate \nas project beneficiaries.  \n   ", "vi   \nRisks and Assumptions  Skilled  and  experienced  staff  members  are  assumed  to  be \navailable for project activities. The problem of having only a small \nnumber of skilled staff members in key Government agencies has \nbeen  mitigated  in  project  design  through  consultancies  and \ntraining. Improvement of atoll administration requires that (i) all \nstaff members trained under the Project will not be transferred to \nother institutions, (ii) collection and analysis of environmental data \nand drafting of land-use plans will be timely, and (iii) MOAD and \nPIUs  will  have  the  commitment,  and  receive  the  appropriate \namount of resources, to carry out their mandate. \n \nThe Project assumes that, as agreed with the Government, a legal \nframework allowing cooperatives to exist as legal entities and to \nengage in multipurpose activities such as running of sanitation \nfacilities  will  be  accomplished  before  loan  effectiveness. \nGovernment support will be required to ensure that island chiefs \nencourage the proper functioning of the community cooperative \non their islands. Principal assumptions include a strong sense of \nownership of and commitment to the Project, especially by the \nimplementing agency.  \n   \n \n ", " ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of the Maldives for the Regional Development Project, Phase II \u2013 Environmental \nInfrastructure and Management.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The Maldives are a chain of 1,190 small low-lying coral islands grouped into 26 atolls in \nthe Indian Ocean: 198 islands are inhabited, 80 house tourist resorts, and only 33 are over 1 \nsquare kilometer. The islands are predominantly coastal entities, and their ecosystems are \namong the most vulnerable in the world. The Maldives\u2019s fragile coral reefs and coasts, which \ncomprise the main source of livelihood in the atolls, need to be protected.  \n \n3.  The Maldives have a narrow economic base that relies on two key sectors\u2014tourism and \nfisheries. Economic growth has been strong since the 1990s; it was 8.5% in 2003. Although \nfisheries declined by 5% from 2002 levels, marine exports increased by over 35%, reflecting \nstronger export prices and larger volume and accounting for the overall increase in total exports \nin 2003. Aside from marine products, most of what is consumed in the country is imported. The \ncombination of heavy reliance on tourism and fisheries, and high dependence on imports leaves \nthe country highly vulnerable to external shock.2 \n \n4.  Strong economic growth has resulted in improving development indicators. In 2002, life \nexpectancy was 67.2 years, literacy 97.2%, and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita \n$4,798 (in purchasing power parity). Yet despite tremendous progress, a large proportion of the \npopulation remains poor, primarily due to regional disparities in living conditions related to \nremoteness of the islands and lack of infrastructure and social services on the outer islands.3  \n \n5.  The Maldives suffers income and non-income poverty. Using Rf15 ($1.17) per capita per \nday as the threshold, the resulting poverty headcount in 1998 was 43%.4 Although a significant \neffort to reduce poverty had been undertaken by the Government over the past 6 years, the \nrecently occurred tsunami disaster severely impacted more than 25,000 people or 10% of the \nMaldives total population.5 The overall picture does not show the high degree of regional \nincome inequality. The concentration of the tourism industry and the Government administrative \napparatus in Mal\u00e9 has led to a large and widening gap between the capital and the outer \nislands. An estimated 70% of the population outside Mal\u00e9 has incomes equivalent to only the \nleast wealthy 20% in Mal\u00e9. The ratio of incomes in Mal\u00e9 compared with the atolls is 2:1, \nincreasing to 3:1 when the lowest average per capita income is considered. High degrees of \ninequality exist in social and physical infrastructure and services, estimated at 4:1 on average. \n                                                 \n \n1  ADB. 2002.

", "2   \nThe atolls have acute unemployment further affected by the recent disaster. Income sources are \nthreatened by environmental degradation. Most people lack access to electricity, transport, \ncommunications, education, health, potable drinking water, recreation facilities, and selected \nconsumer goods. Quality of housing and the natural environment is uneven. Food insecurity and \nmalnutrition are widespread in the atolls. This is a challenge that the Government has sought to \naddress since the 1970s, by undertaking a comprehensive program of regional development to \nopen the entire archipelago to increased economic opportunities. Despite targeted Government \nefforts, marked regional disparities still exist.  \n \n6.  Unique  geography  and  vulnerability  pose  two  key  development  challenges  for  the \ncountry.  First,  the  dispersion  of  the  population  across  the  archipelago  raises  the  cost  of \ndelivering social services, as economies of scale are difficult to achieve in service provision. \nSecond,  some  inhabited  islands  have  become  ecologically  vulnerable,  while  others  have \nbecome too densely populated. The greater Mal\u00e9 area, already home to 70,000 people or \nalmost a quarter of the population, is of specific concern. The continuing inward migration to \nMal\u00e9, in response to ecological vulnerability of the outer atolls, better job opportunities, and \nhigher quality of social and public services, has severely increased population pressure in the \nregion. A discussion of the institutional sector is in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  As highlighted in the sixth National Development Plan,6 regional development is key to \neasing the development pressure on Mal\u00e9 as well as solving equity problems. Private sector \nactivities, which would spur economic growth, have been limited in the atolls due to lack of basic \ninfrastructure. While progress has been made in providing water and storage through rainwater \ntank programs on many islands in the Central Regions, investment in sanitation and solid waste \nmanagement  remains  low  and  has  sometimes  been  unsuccessful.  This  has  resulted  in \ndeteriorating living conditions on many inhabited islands where the freshwater lens is at risk \nthrough groundwater pollution and high salinity levels. Pollution of the lagoons is widespread. \nThese problems are particularly serious on densely populated islands such as Naifaru. The \ntraditional approach to land management through land allocation has added a number of other \nfundamental environmental problems, including (i) inefficient use of scarce land resources, (ii) \ncostly and overdesigned utilities and infrastructure, and (iii) badly located development that \njeopardizes the conservation of freshwater and the marine environment.  \n \n8.  Water Supply and Sanitation. Water on the outer islands is almost entirely supplied \nthrough a combination of groundwater extraction, mainly through domestic wells, and rainwater \ntanks, which are the principal source of drinking water. Increasing groundwater extraction levels, \nresulting from population and development pressures, are depleting the freshwater lens, a \nsituation frequently exacerbated by the use of electric water pumps. This, in turn, leads to saline \nintrusion into the groundwater aquifer, thus restricting its resource value. As a result, individual \nhousehold and communal rainwater tanks are increasingly needed as the principal source of \ndrinking water. Communal tanks are necessary to provide water in times of drought and to meet \nthe needs of families unable to afford or accommodate individual tanks. The situation was \nfurther exacerbated by the 2004 tsunami disaster which caused damage to the water lens in \nmany islands. The recovery of the aquifer is uncertain as it is the period of time this will take. \n \n                                                 \n6  The Government\u2019s vision for promoting regional development is based on a diversified economy. This process \ninvolves a gradual shift toward a decentralized and service-based economy, which will result in job creation, \nimproved services and infrastructure, development of human capital, and efficient institutional support ", "    3 \n9.  Groundwater resources are at risk of bacterial contamination caused by effluent leakage \nand pollutant migration from poorly constructed and maintained septic tanks and other disposal \nfacilities. In high-density island environments, the construction and operation and maintenance \n(O&M) of septic tanks are complex, and a small-bore pipe network is a common alternative. \nThese  small-bore  systems  are  generally  not  well  designed,  often  malfunction, and  usually \nconvey  raw  sewage  directly  into  the  lagoon.  Assets  have  deteriorated  due  to  deferred \nmaintenance, a situation aggravated by the Government\u2019s necessary budget control measures. \nGovernment and community initiatives have not always been successful, and faulty systems are \nconducive to marine pollution. The Maldives Water and Sanitation Authority (MWSA), with \nVoluntary Service Overseas (VSO) assistance, has developed an environmental awareness \nprogram, used in selected atolls. However, resource constraints have prevented its widespread \napplication. \n \n10.  Solid  Waste  Management.  The  outer  islands  have  no  formal  waste  management \nsystems, except for two landfill sites7 and the central landfill facility of Thilafushi,8 serving Mal\u00e9. \nMuch of the waste material is not separated, and hazardous and toxic materials are deposited in \ngarbage dumps. Dumps sites are not planned and designed as sustainable landfill sites, and \nare  often  close  to  houses  and/or  lagoons.  Households  deposit  wastes  randomly,  and \nenvironmentally unsafe waste burning is common. Conventional approaches present a series of \nproblems,  including  the  need  for  substantial  areas  of  land,  which  must  be  separate  from \nresidential and sensitive land-use areas. Marine pollution, particularly lagoon pollution, and \nlong-term risks of groundwater through leachate drainage, will be a severe risk. Communities \nare  becoming  increasingly  conscious  of  the  need  for  environmentally  sound  management \npractices, and a number of individual island initiatives take a better approach to solid waste \ncollection and disposal, but the country still has no comprehensive and sustainable approach to \nsolid  waste  management.  The  need  to  expedite  adequate  practices  and  systems,  and  to \norganize the sector for efficient operation emerged to be particularly important in the aftermath \nof the tsunami. \n \n11.  Land Management. The traditional approach to land management on the outer islands \n(including the Central Regions) through land allocation has resulted in a number of fundamental \nenvironmental problems, particularly on inhabited islands. These problems include (i) inefficient \nuse of scarce land resources, (ii) costly and overdesigned support utilities and infrastructure, (iii) \nbadly located built development that jeopardizes conservation of groundwater aquifers and the \ncoastal environment, and (iv) development of incompatible land-use facilities in close proximity. \nWhile  policy,  legislation,  and  environmental  impacts  have  been  extensively  assessed, \nimproperly considered development and inadequate monitoring and enforcement may lead to \nunsustainable development, such as garbage dumping in lagoons. The Government has taken \nland-use  planning  initiatives,  including  endorsement  of  preliminary  planning  guidelines  for \napplication  at  national  level,  and  formulation  of  land-use  plans  for  selected  islands  in  the \nnorthern and southern regions.9 Further institutional strengthening is required to confirm the \nland-use planning process, provide a comprehensive planning framework and guidelines for use \non the outer islands, and prepare land-use plans incorporating aspirations defined in the atoll \nand island development plans.  \n                                                 \n7  The landfill sites were developed under the ADB-supported project Regional Development Project, Phase I (ADB. \n1999. Report and Recommendation to the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Republic \nof the Maldives Regional Development Project. Manila), including the newly opened solid waste management \nfacility at Kuludhuffushi. \n8  According to the State of Environment report, more than 400 tons of waste is transported daily to Thilafushi \n(Ministry of Home Affairs and Environment. 2002. State of Environment, 2000. Maldives). \n9  This was done in the context of the Regional Development Project, Phase I (footnote 7). ", "4   \n12.  Governance. The form and nature of governance have been slow to reflect regional \ndevelopment  initiatives  and  the  needs  and  aspirations  of  beneficiary  communities.  The \ntraditional \u201ctop down\u201d sectoral approach of Government line agencies has sometimes resulted in \ninefficient project investment. Community participation has been inadequate, and private sector \nmobilization  weak.  Community  organizations  are  traditionally  important.  Community  groups \nprovide most public or collective services available on distant islands. The demand for good-\nquality  local  government  services  such  as  public  administration,  judiciary,  police,  water, \nsanitation,  electricity,  communication  has  been  rising  with  population  expansion,  higher \nincomes, and improved education. Providing such facilities and services to each inhabited \nisland is, however, expensive, given the small populations. The Government is thus developing \nselected focus islands to serve as local government hubs for the atolls. The Government \npromotes community participation in delivery of public services to empower atoll communities \nand  to  increase  accountability  and  ownership  of  the  communities  delivering  the  services. \nWherever possible, the Government aims to concentrate the delivery of local public services to \nimprove access, convenience of use, and efficiency of land use on the space-scarce focus \nislands.  \n \n13.  Policy Dialogue. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) integrated policy dialogue with \nthe Government is defined within the comprehensive National Development Framework and, \ncomplementing  development  programs,  aims  to  help  stimulate  economic  development  and \nreduce poverty in a sustainable fashion through the following: \n \n(i)  Integrate (among sectors and governments, and spatially) and coordinate public \nprograms by developing decentralized and multisectoral planning processes with \nparticipation  of  the  poor,  public-private  partnerships,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation. \n(ii)  Manage  and  conserve  natural  resources  by  continuing  water  quality  and \nsanitation programs, coastal zone management, and land-use planning to target \npublic infrastructure investments. Guide decentralized planning. \n(iii)  Promote environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable activities that \ncreate  jobs  for  the  poor,  by  improving  the  access  of  the  outer  islands  to \ninfrastructure services, particularly energy, water and sanitation, and transport, \nand by scaling up and replicating sustainable development and poverty reduction \npaths regionally. \n \n14.  External Agency Coordination. ADB\u2019s strategy will be implemented in an integrated \nfashion to complement leverage programs of, and coordinate with, existing partners, especially \nin areas of sustainable and integrated regional development, support to development of local \nparticipatory mechanisms, and environmental management. Aside from the Government, the \nmain partners include the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP),10 World Bank, and \nIslamic  Development  Bank.  During  implementation  and  where  applicable,  activities  will  be \ncoordinated. Other relevant past and ongoing external assistance in social infrastructure is listed \nin Appendix 3. \n \n15.  Lessons Learned. Lessons from ADB projects in the Maldives and in small island \ncountries have been built into the Project. The Regional Phase Project, Phase I (foonote 6) is \nestimated  to  be  completed  by  31  December  2005.  Phase  II  will  benefit  from  the  positive \nlessons, including, among others, the successful operation of revolving funds for rainwater \n                                                 \n10  UNDP has led in introducing community-based mechanisms at island level, which assist in job creation, social \ndevelopment, and small-scale environmental improvements.  ", "    5 \ncatchment. A review of phase I highlighted the need to (i) incorporate mechanisms to ensure \nthat  O&M  are  integral  to  the  Project,  (ii)  incorporate  integrated  solid  waste  management \nprograms to minimize waste production and maximize waste reuse and recycling benefits; and \n(iii)  strengthen  staffing  in  the  regional  offices.  This  Project  will  incorporate  these  findings, \nstrengthen local coordination and management of services, and ensure that infrastructure is \ndesigned and implemented to meet local community needs. To avoid divergence between social \ninfrastructure and community needs and aspirations, responsive mechanisms in project design \nand implementation must be established.  \n \n16.  The most effective way to improve the service quality is to build on island solidarity and \ndevelop  community  ownership  and  accountability.  Most  line  agencies  have  limited \nimplementation capacity due to scarce skilled and experienced staff. Project implementation is \ndelayed due to a lack of coordination between Government agencies, the initial phases of \nappointing consultants, and awarding of contracts. Implementation capacity and coordination \nmust be strengthened, and long-term training provided for project staff in the relevant agencies \nas well as at the atoll and island levels.  \n \n17.   Project implementation will be integrated to complement and provide leverage to other \nexternal programs and to support the development of community-based initiatives. The Project \nincludes a number of features designed to support the Government\u2019s 6th National Development \nPlan and ADB\u2019s Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement. These include consolidation and \nuse of participatory mechanisms at the local level to ensure that the poor and vulnerable can \nparticipate and benefit. Interisland consortia and integrated monitoring and evaluation for all \nprograms will be set up, local government management strengthened, and island development \nplans (IDPs) and atoll development plans (ADPs) prepared for each atoll. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Outcome \n18.  The Project seeks to promote regional development to support equitable access to \nsocial  services  and,  therefore,  relieve  Mal\u00e9  of  intense  development  population  and \nenvironmental pressures. The project goal is to increase the standard of living in the Central \nRegions.11 The project objective is to improve environmental and land management through a \ncommunity-centered approach. The Project includes a balance of institutional, infrastructure, \nand environmental improvements in the focus islands and their region. The Project will help \nsafeguard  public  health  and  the  environment,  support  community  and  private  sector \nparticipation  in  waste  management  and  sanitation,  and  increase  public  awareness  of \nresponsible environmental management practices. The Project combines policy improvement, \ncapacity building, and investment in physical facilities.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n19.  To accomplish its objective, the Project has three closely interrelated components:  \n \n (i)  Part A: Improving environmental infrastructure. This covers  \n(a) sanitation and sewerage improvements,  \n                                                 \n11  The Central Regions were particularly affected by the 2004 tsunami. While this project will provide assistance to \nareas affected by the tsunami and therefore complement activities undertaken by the Maldives TEAP (footnote 5), \nthe project aims to promote long-term development objectives, including institutional strengthening, policy dialogue, \nand environmental management. ", "6   \n(b) water supply, and  \n(c) integrated solid waste management.  \n \n(ii)   Part  B:  Strengthening  planning  and  environmental  management.  This \nincludes  \n(a) land-use planning and management,  \n(b) formulation of an economic development framework study for the \n      regional growth centers,  \n(c) developing an environmental awareness program, and  \n(d) environmental monitoring.  \n \n(iii)   Part C: Building management and implementation capacity. This covers  \n(a) community mobilization facilitation, and  \n(b) institutional strengthening for improved project management. \n \n1.  Part A: Improving Environmental Infrastructure \n20.  This component is geared to meet the needs and capacity of island communities and \nindividual households. Its activities will be included in the IDPs and ADPs, and infrastructure will \nonly be constructed once the land-use plans have been approved and the legal framework to \nestablish utility cooperatives issued.  \n \na.   Sanitation and Sewage Treatment and Disposal  \n21.  A settled sewerage system will be constructed under the Project for Mahibadhoo and \nFonadhoo. The system is considered to be the most cost-effective and technically sound way to \nprovide sustainable sanitation arrangements, as population densities are high; flow gradients \nare  small;  and  the  climate,  which  is  warm  with  high  humidity  and  seawater-laden  winds, \naccelerates  the  corrosion  of  mechanical,  electrical,  and  other  susceptible  equipment.  The \nsystem can be easily replicated on most outer islands.12 Solid wastes are retained in household \nseptic tanks13 while liquid wastes are discharged from tanks through small-bore sewers.  \n \n22.  The Project will provide reed bed facilities14 to treat liquid waste leaving the septic tanks \non the two selected islands. Reuse of treated effluent for agriculture will be the preferred option, \nif agricultural standards are achieved and demand is present.15 Recharging of the groundwater \naquifer will be considered when the reed bed treatment achieves World Health Organization \n(WHO)-recommended concentration levels for groundwater. The Project will provide a deep-sea \noutlet for the effluent16 to be discharged through, if required. Provided septage areas will be \nsuitably dried, stabilized, and sterilized. Sludge and vegetable matter will be composted with \ngreen waste and used to improve the soil. Detailed design for Naifaru17 will be undertaken. An \nO&M strategy will be developed for the sanitation and solid waste management components,18 \n                                                 \n12  The schemes are based upon 2020 populations and a sewage flow of 225 cubic meters per day. \n13  Biological oxygen demand is reduced up to 60%, and suspended solids are virtually eliminated in the septic tanks. \n14 Reed bed plants assimilate pollutants and enhance evaporation, reducing the pollutants in solution and suspension \nand the total amount of effluent. Fecal coliforms can be reduced by up to two orders of magnitude, and nitrogen \ngreatly reduced over longer retention times. \n15  Demand for agricultural-grade water is expected to be variable based on seasonal requirements.  \n16  The liquid effluent discharged to the sea will meet World Bank discharge standards.  \n17  Detailed design will be based on conventional or settled sewerage with reed bed treatment. \n18 The O&M strategy will include detailed methodology for tariff structure, collection, and administration. Building from \nwillingness-to-pay surveys and affordability data, user charges will be developed in a consultative and participatory \nmanner, accounting for income disparities and focusing on cost recovery for O&M.  ", "    7 \nproviding a solid foundation to collect user charges and administer the cooperative, ensuring the \nschemes\u2019 financial sustainability. Communities will be trained to lead in O&M.  \n \nb.  Water Supply  \n23.  Water supply on the focus islands and across all the atolls in the Central Regions is \ndeficient. The Project will support Ministry of Health (MOH) and UNDP like programs to provide \nindividual and communal storage rainwater tanks and improve roofs and gutters, by including a \nrainwater collection financing component to help households purchase rainwater storage tanks19 \nand/or rehabilitate or improve rainwater harvesting equipment. Priority will be given to lower \nincome households and those that do not own a rainwater tank. Financing facilities for the \npurchase  of  rainwater  storage  tanks  and/or  rainwater  harvesting  shall  be  provided  at \nconcessional interest rates, to cover exclusively administrative costs of the financial facility. \nWater catchment improvements, particularly on islands with reduced potable water during the \ndry season, will be maximized through the community awareness program for environmental \nmanagement. \n \nc.  Integrated Solid Waste Management \n24.  The  principal  thrust  of  this  subcomponent  is  to  halt  and  reverse  environmental \ndegradation caused by inadequate solid waste management practices on the outer islands. The \ncomponent  will  help  achieve  the  long-term  goals  of  safeguarding  public  health  and  the \nenvironment, supporting community and private-sector participation in waste management, and \nincreasing public awareness of responsible waste management.  \n \n25.  The Project will support policy development initiatives of the Ministry of Environment and \nConstruction  (MEC)  by  conducting  a  waste  management  study  to  formulate  solid  waste \ncollection and disposal strategies at the atoll level, emphasizing the reuse and recycling of solid \nwaste, and the potential to maximize commercial value of solid waste and minimize the need for \nlandfill.  The  study\u2019s  results  will  be  used  to  formulate  a  national  solid  waste  management \nframework and serve as the basis to build physical infrastructure. The Project will provide solid \nwaste management centers in Naifaru, Mohibadoo, and Fonadhoo-Gan. Most waste generated \non  the  islands  and  atolls  will  either  be  reprocessed/stored  for  local  use,  or  stored  for \ntransshipment in the solid waste management centers.20 The centers will optimize the potential \nfor community involvement in O&M.  \n \n26.  The Project will build capacity by developing and implementing public awareness and \ntraining campaigns to (i) establish and improve waste collection systems and cost recovery, and \n(ii) reduce waste generation and develop schemes for household composting at the island and \natoll levels. MEC will lead in preparing and realizing the solid waste management awareness \nand training campaigns.21  \n \n                                                 \n19  This initiative was particularly successful among beneficiaries under the Regional Development Project, Phase I \n(footnote 7).  \n20  The solid waste management centers will receive segregated waste and manage it according to type: green and \ncompostable material will be processed using vessel composting technology, recyclables will be bailed and \ntransported to a central facility for sale, and inert residuals will be reused locally. \n21  MEC will coordinate with other agencies active in the field of solid waste management and composting, such as the \nMinistry of Fisheries, Agriculture and Marine Resources (MOFAMR), to optimize this output\u2019s delivery. ", "8   \n2.  Part B: Strengthening Planning and Environmental Management \na.  Land-Use Planning and Management \n27.  The Project will build and strengthen capacity in land surveying and land-use planning of \nkey  Government  agencies  such  as  the  Maldives  Housing  and  Urban  Development  Board \n(MHUDB) and Ministry of Atolls Development (MOAD), and atoll officials. Capacity building will \nbe composed of (i) short-term training of local staff by an international consultant, focusing on \nformulation  of  land-use  plans;  and  (ii)  complementary  overseas  education,  in  the  form  of \npostgraduate degrees in town and country planning, to enhance overall capability for land use at \nthe atoll level. This component will provide the resource capacity to implement and operate the \nplanning guidelines,22 benefiting all atoll islands. This component will facilitate the preparation of \n24 land-use plans for the regional growth centers identified in the Central Regions23 over 3 \nyears. The land-use plans will be carried out in a participatory manner, reflect community needs \nand aspirations as defined in the IDPs and incorporate atoll-wide development objectives as \ndefined in the ADPs.  \n \nb.  Regional Economic Development \n28.  The Project will address constraints and opportunities for regional growth and economic \ndevelopment  through  a  case  study  in  economic  development  planning  for  regional  growth \ncenters. The study24 will prepare an economic development framework. The first phase, for \nFonadhoo-Gan  in  Laamu  Atoll,  will  present  a  comprehensive  range  of  proposals  for \ndevelopment and job-creating activities, together with supporting implementation arrangements \nand an investment program. The study will (i) identify economic development growth sectors \nand projects for improved livelihoods, (ii) assess skills development and training needs, (iii) \nevaluate and guide investment opportunities for microfinance and household-level development \ninitiatives,  and  (iv)  help  vulnerable  groups.  The  study  will  support  Government  policy  and \nestablish an approach to atoll economic development. Building on the study\u2019s outcomes, studies \nfor the Lhaviyani and Alif Dhaal Atolls will be undertaken. These can then be used as a model \nfor other regions/atolls.  \n \nc.  Environmental Awareness \n29.  The Project will develop and implement an environmental awareness, education, and \noutreach program for the selected regions, building on the experience of the jointly developed \nMWSA and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation \nTransformation (PHAST)25 to promote environmental awareness and hygiene. As part of the \nenvironmental  awareness  component,  the  Project  will  adopt  the  hygiene  improvement \nframework and train and support island development committees (IDCs), women\u2019s development \ncommittees (WDCs), and community leaders in planning, monitoring, and evaluating sanitation \nand hygiene improvement. The Project will incorporate gender-appropriate and user-friendly \napproaches  for  boys, girls,  men, women,  and  out-of-school  children.  The  Project  will  help \n                                                 \n22 The Planning Guidelines for Land-Use Planning were approved by the President in March 2004.  \n23  A model land-use plan for Fonadhoo was prepared under the project preparatory technical assistance. \n24  The study will coordinate with ongoing ADB assistance and the World Bank Integrated Human Development \nProject, and will build on findings from studies supported by other external agencies (2001, Strategic Economic \nPlan, Phase I, Government of Singapore; and 2004, Old, Exisiting and Potential Income Generation Activities in the \nMaldives, Published by Ministry of Atolls Development with the assistance of UNDP and  the United Nations \nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, Mal\u00e9). \n25  The PHAST methodology centers around training of trainers, mostly teachers and extension trainers, who, using \nthe same basic information and teaching media, transmit the message to the island population. ", "    9 \nprepare  an  environmental  awareness  package,  and  associated  supporting  materials  and \nmanuals. If practical, a nongovernment organization (NGO) will help design and implement the \nawareness program.26 In the initial phase, the program will deliver training to Lhaviyani, Alif \nDhaal, and Laamu atolls, followed by a second phase, covering the remaining atolls in the \nCentral Regions. \n \nd.  Environmental Monitoring \n30.  The Project will include an environmental monitoring program to establish pattern and \ntrends in groundwater quality and salinity levels. Initially, monitoring will be conducted on the \nfocus  islands,  then,  after  staff  training,  on  the  remaining  inhabited  islands  in  the  Central \nRegions. The Project will help prepare a study to obtain basic hydro-geological data to define \nappropriate minimum spacing between gray water and sewage facilities and domestic wells, \nand, therefore, prevent pollutant infiltration and groundwater contamination. Pollutant migration \nin the atoll aquifer will be investigated to guide on-site sanitation, reuse of gray water, and \ndisposal of treated effluent as part of the sewage scheme.  \n \n3.  Part C: Management and Implementation Capacity Building \na.  Community Mobilization \n31.  The  Project  will  review  approaches  to  community  organization  for  environmental \nmanagement in the Maldives, refine a preferred approach in consultation with other international \nagencies, and detail project activities to organize communities for O&M of water utilities and \nsolid waste management. In each region, the Project will train project implementation unit (PIU) \nstaff, IDC and WDC members, and NGOs supporting community-based O&M activities. In the \ninitial phase, priority will be given to communities on the three focus islands. Later, communities \nmay be mobilized and organized on other islands where opportunities for community-based \nO&M of the utility and solid waste management sector are identified. After collecting baseline \ninformation on the communities, the Project will define a methodology for prioritization.27 Trained \nPIU staff and IDC and WDC members, assisted by consultants, will then activate community \ncouncils and structures for community-based management. Details are in Appendix 4. \n \nb.  Institutional Strengthening  \n32.  Project implementation will require dedicated staff assigned by the Ministry of Finance \nand Treasury (MOFT), MOAD, and primary participating agencies (MWSA, MHUDB, and MEC). \nThe  Project  will  train  and  technically  support  the  participating  agencies  to  plan,  manage, \nmonitor, and evaluate the Project. Coordination and implementation capacity building will be \nprovided to the project management unit (PMU) and PIUs. Capacity-building skills will include \ncoordination,  project  monitoring  and  evaluation,  technical  and  quality  control  procedures, \nfinancial  management  and  reporting,  management  information  systems,  accounting, \nprocurement, community mobilization, and social and environmental monitoring and planning. \nAssistance will also be given to providing administrative, financial, and technical skills required \n                                                 \n26  In addition to the overall PHAST component, the environmental awareness curricula may include (i) rain and water \nresources management, (ii) vegetation and groundwater resources, (iii) pumping and salinity, (iv) water resources \nand sewerage, (vi) solid waste, (vii) lagoon and beach protection and/or (viii) beach erosion. MWSA will coordinate \nwith agencies such as MEC in the finalization of the program. \n27  Community organization activities implemented in three to five communities per year will comprise workshops, \ntraining of trainers, and networking. The criteria may include expressions of interest, commitment, and extent of \nenvironmental degradation. ", "10  \nto manage community cooperatives and/or private utility companies, where proposed. Specific \ntraining for O&M of utilities will be provided to PMU and PIU staff and communities. Technical \ntraining packages and manuals for this purpose will be prepared under the Project.  \n \n33.  The  Project  will  help  MWSA  PIU  staff  strengthen  its  capacity  to  implement  the \nenvironmental management and awareness subcomponents and improve long-term resource \ncapability.28 MHUDB as the planning authority and MEC (Environment Section) will benefit from \ncapacity-building and training programs built into the Project.29 The programs should combine (i) \nshort-term training for in-house staff and (ii) selected overseas higher education programs for \nconcerned agencies. MOAD will submit for ADB's concurrence a 5-year strategic training plan \nwithin 3 months of fielding project management consultants and an annual training plan before \n31 October of each year. The plan will specify training institutions, methodologies, targeted \npopulation, and expected outputs. In accordance with the gender action plan, 30% of trainees \nwill be women (Appendix 5). \n \nC.  Special Features \n1.  Environmental Protection \n34.  By  increasing  drinking  water,  the  Project  will  help  protect  the  freshwater  lens from \noverextraction, protect public health from potential waterborne contamination, and reduce the \noverall demands on the fragile aquifer, particularly affected after the December 2004 tsunami. \nThe Project will include the installation of sanitation solutions,30 reducing potential groundwater \ncontamination. The environmental monitoring program will provide a mechanism to evaluate any \nchanges  resulting  from  additional  extraction  for  nonconsumptive  purposes,  or  from \ncontamination due to wastewater disposal. If changes are significant, then measures to protect \nthe freshwater lens will be implemented. The solid waste collection and management program \nwill help stop the uncontrolled disposal of garbage. Incorporation of source separation and \nrecycling will help raise public awareness of the need for wise stewardship of the fragile atoll \necosystem. Community efforts to remove scattered waste from the islands and surrounding \nwater will make them more visually appealing. A comprehensive land-use management plan for \nthe area will help identify appropriate land uses, establish maximum densities, protect sensitive \nareas such as water catchment zones and wetlands, and disclose the islands\u2019 carrying capacity. \n \n35.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) was conducted to identify potential project \nimpacts. The environmental analysis focused on those impacts associated with improvements in \nsewage and sanitation systems, and solid waste management. The analysis focused on project \nelements that would enhance and protect the environment. The summary IEE is in Appendix 7. \nThe conclusion was that an environmental impact assessment is not needed. Overall, the \nProject will improve the natural and human environment and reverse the negative impact on the \ndynamics of the atoll system and its ecology. The Project will improve management and develop \nscarce resources, such as freshwater, that reflect the islands\u2019 carrying capacity. \n \n                                                 \n28 MWSA has limited human resources. Staff experience, nevertheless, includes implementation of settled sewerage \nand sanitation programs (including the formulation of guidelines on construction and O&M of septic tanks) and pilot \nreed bed wastewater schemes. MEC, recently mandated to manage solid waste, may have limited experience in \nthe field, but will be coordinating closely with MOFAMR, and specific agencies with experience in solid waste \ncollection (in Mal\u00e9) and composting. \n29 Close coordination of the project requirements will take place with the on-going ADB Technical Assistance for \nCapacity Building for Regional Development.  \n30  Selection criteria for sanitation improvement on the islands are in Appendix 6. ", "    11 \n2.  Resource Management \n36.  The  land-use  planning  and  management  component  will  significantly  improve  land \nmanagement in the atolls by (i) providing a proper context for land allocation, (ii) providing a \ncontext for social mobilization and participation in land management, (iii) ensuring sustainable \nlevels of development on inhabited islands, (iv) providing a context for the optimal and least-cost \nprovision of utilities and other services, and (v) ensuring the conservation of environmentally \nsensitive areas such as freshwater aquifers and lagoons. The Project will complete land-use \nplans that reflect the carrying capacity of the islands\u2019 natural systems, increase understanding of \nhow to balance development with environmental protection, and provide the capacity for land-\nuse planning. The Project will strengthen Government capacity to develop the regions, including \nsupport for an economic development framework for regional development centers. The project \ncomponents  will  be  designed  for  replication.  Facilitating  sustainable  livelihoods  through \nenvironmental improvement, and providing basic infrastructure and social services are required \nfor regional development and poverty reduction.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n37.  The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies, is estimated at $7.5 \nmillion equivalent. Of the total cost, $5.38 million (71%) comprises the foreign exchange cost, \nand  $2.12 million  equivalent  (29%)  the  local currency  cost.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n39.  MOFT will be the Project's Executing Agency, and MOAD, the Implementing Agency. A \nnational project steering committee (NPSC) will be established to oversee the Project, and will \nconsist of senior-level representatives from MOFT; MOAD; Ministry of Planning and National \nDevelopment;  MOH;  MEC;  MHUDB;  Ministry  of  Gender,  Family  Development  and  Social \nSecurity; at the director level or above, and representatives of the atolls. The NPSC will be \nchaired by the deputy minister of MOAD; the deputy director general of MOAD will be the \nsecretary. The NPSC will advise and guide the Project on policy decisions and operations. The \nNSPC will hold its first meeting within 3 months of loan effectiveness and meet quarterly. A \nregional project advisory committee (RPAC) will be established on each focus island to advise \non atoll development coordination. The RPAC shall consist of representatives from IDC, WDC, \nisland office, PIU and as applicable, the local NGOs and chaired by a senior officer to be \nappointed by the Minister of Atolls Development. MOAD will set up a PMU, led by a full-time \nproject director with adequate sector-related and managerial experience, and communication \nskills. The project director will be charged exclusively with the Project\u2019s execution and will have \nno other duties within MOAD. A core team of staff members from MOAD (deputy project \ndirector, financial and accounting manager, social development specialist); MOH (environmental \nengineer); and MHUDB (land-use planner) will assist the PD. Supported by the PMU, the project \ndirector will be responsible for (i) coordinating all activities under the Project; (ii) liaising and \nreporting to ADB; (iii) managing the PMU account; (iv) managing finances and reporting project \naccounts; (iv) liaising with other government agencies; (v) developing training materials, policy \nmanuals,  and  technical  guidelines;  (vi)  monitoring  and  evaluating  PIUs;  and  (vi)  giving \nmanagement and policy support to the PIUs. \n \n                                                 \n31  Beneficiaries\u2019 contribution will be mostly in kind, covering labor costs for civil works.  ", "    13 \n40.  The  PMU  will  (i)  prepare  the  overall  project  implementation  plan  and  consolidated \nannual work plan, (ii) help the PIUs implement island and atoll development plans, (iii) supervise \nall  project  management  activities,  (iv)  organize  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities,  (v) \nsupervise the implementation of the gender action plan and other activities under the summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy, and (vi) prepare overall progress reports and the project \ncompletion report. \n \n41.  Each focus island will have a PIU, with three sections: (i) environment and sanitation, (ii) \ngovernance and social development, and (iii) planning. Qualified staff will head each section. \nThe  PIU  will  be  headed  by  a  project  manager  working  from  the  region,  with  suitable \nqualifications and good managerial and communication skills. ADB endorsement will be sought. \nThe  PIUs  will  employ  full-time  at  least  one  accountant,  one  sanitation  and  environmental \ntechnical expert, and one social development specialist for the duration of the Project; and one \nland-use planner for at least the first 3 years of project implementation. Depending on the size \nof the region and the workload, additional technical staff may be deputed from line agencies and \nministries, thus transfer skills and technology to the regions and improve capability. The PIU will \nbe active in developing the structure of the regional development management office and \ncontribute to the technical and regional development functions. \n \n42.  The  PIU  will  help  the  Project  (i)  prepare  the  island  and  atoll  development  plans \nconcurrently with the required land-use plan, (ii) mobilize communities, (iii) coordinate between \nthe Project and community, (iv) tender works and services for project subcomponents, (v) \nimplement  construction  works,  (vi)  implement  the  gender  action  plan,  (vii)  account  for \nexpenditures, (viii) monitor and report on project activities, and (ix) prepare project progress \nreports. PIU staff will be trained at the beginning of the Project in civil works, sanitation, solid \nwaste management, planning, and regular project administrative responsibilities. Each PIU will \nhave an accounting section, directly under the project manager, to deal with procedural aspects \nand  recording  of  financial  transactions  and  to  prepare  liquidation  of  statements  and \nreplenishment requests to the PMU. \n \n43.  The PMU and PIUs will be supported by a team of consultants headed by a project \nadvisor and team leader and deputy team leader.32 Other consultants supporting the Project will \ninclude  a  financial  management  and  procurement  specialist,  a  monitoring  and  evaluation \nspecialist,  a  land-use  planner,  and  a  social  development  specialist.  Detailed  training \nrequirements will be assessed at the beginning of the Project, providing staff from the PMU, \nPIUs, atolls, islands, MOAD, MHUDB, and MOFT, and other stakeholders with timely training \nopportunities at the atoll, regional, and national levels. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n44.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years. Implementation is expected to commence \nin the fourth quarter of 2005. Start-up activities will include the establishment of the national and \nregional steering committees, recruitment of project staff and consultants, preparation of the \ntraining assessment, conducting feasibility studies, and procurement of immediately required \nequipment. Physical works may not start until the first quarter of 2007 due to the need to draw \nup  land-use  plans  for  approval  and  to  prepare  detailed  engineering  designs  and  contract \ndocuments. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n                                                 \n32  The team leader (international) and deputy team leader (domestic) will be environmental engineers. ", "14  \n3.  Procurement \n45.  Procurement will generally be carried out by the PIUs under the PMU\u2019s guidance. Goods \nand related services, and civil works to be financed from loan proceeds will be procured in \naccordance with Guidelines for Procurement under Asian Development Bank Loans and the \nGovernment\u2019s procurement procedures acceptable to ADB. The sanitation schemes will be \nintegrated into a combined design and supervision, and supply and construction packages for \ninternational competitive bidding. Equipment packages valued at $500,000 equivalent or less \nwill be procured following international shopping procedures acceptable to ADB and packages \nvalued at $100,000 equivalent or less will be under direct purchasing procedures. Civil works \ncontracts for the catchment rehabilitation under the rainwater tank component will be small, with \nan average value in the range of $10,000 to $15,000 equivalent, and will follow ADB's Guide on \nCommunity Participation in Procurement. The first contract of this type within each of the \nNorthern  Central,  Central  Region  and  Southern  Central  Region  will  be  subject  to  ADB\u2018s \napproval. The proposed procurement packages are in Appendix 10. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n46.  An estimated 141 person-months (61 international, 80 domestic) of consulting services \nare  needed.  Consulting  services  are  required  to  facilitate  project  implementation  and  to \nstrengthen institutional, administrative, and financial capacities of the PMU and PIUs. Loan-\nfinanced consultants for the PMU and PIUs will be engaged through an international consulting \nfirm in accordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and \nIts  Borrowers,  using  a  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The proposed outline terms of \nreference are in Appendix 11. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n47.  The  PMU  will  prepare  disbursement  projections,  request  budgetary  allocations  for \ncounterpart funds, collect supporting documents, and prepare withdrawal applications and send \nthem to ADB in accordance with its Loan Disbursement Handbook. To facilitate the timely \nrelease of loan proceeds and counterpart funds and to expedite project implementation, the \nGovernment will, immediately after loan effectiveness, open and maintain a project imprest \naccount with the Maldives Monetary Authority, to be managed by the PMU. The total advances \nto the imprest account, including the initial advance, will not at any time exceed estimated ADB-\nfinanced expenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. To \nfacilitate project implementation and support the environmental infrastructure component, three \nsecond-generation imprest accounts for each of the PIUs will be established at a commercial \nbank. The initial ceiling of the second-generation imprest account will be $20,000 equivalent, or \nthe estimated ADB-financed expenditures in each PIU in the next 6 months, whichever is lower. \nBecause the PIUs have limited experience with implementing externally financed investment \nprojects, the second-generation imprest accounts will be established only after the fielding of the \nproject-financed  financial  management  consultant.  The  PMU  will  ensure  that  all  imprest \naccounts will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook, and with detailed arrangements agreed to by the Government \nand ADB. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedures, applicable to individual payments of \n$100,000 or less, will be used to liquidate advances from the imprest accounts.  \n ", "    15 \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n48.  The Government will provide ADB with detailed quarterly progress reports on project \nimplementation,  following  ADB  standard  procedures.  The  PMU  will  obtain  and  consolidate \nrelevant data from the PIUs, which will prepare project operating accounts and related financial \nstatements, and records of the statement of expenditure. Auditors acceptable to ADB will audit \nthe imprest account, second-generation imprest accounts, and statement of expenditures. The \nfinal audit report will include a separate audit opinion on these. The PIUs will agree to have their \nproject  operating  accounts  audited  by  the  PMU  before  receiving  any  funding  through  the \nProject. Audited financial statements and project accounts, together with the auditor\u2019s report, will \nbe submitted within 6 months of the close of the financial year. The PMU will submit to ADB, \nwithin 3 months of the physical completion of the Project, a project completion report following \nstandard ADB procedures. The PMU and PIUs will have an adequate number of suitably \nqualified accounting staff, including a senior officer. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n49.  To ensure that project components are managed efficiently and that project benefits are \nmaximized, a project performance management system (PPMS) has been developed. It will \nmonitor and evaluate project information and data to ensure that planned interventions achieve \nthe desired result and benefit the target population. The PPMS will establish a cause-and-effect \nrelationship between the Project and its impact. PPMS activities will be conducted periodically to \ngather  information  from  multiple  sources  to  determine  whether  the  input  deliveries  for \nimplementing project activities have rendered expected benefits to the intended beneficiaries. \nBeneficiaries will be involved in project monitoring evaluation, through direct reporting to PIU \nand through the regional project advisory committees to be established for coordination and \nmonitoring. The PPMS also seeks to detect any deficiencies and discrepancies between the \nproject plan and execution in using resources efficiently so that timely corrections can be made \nto update the Project and thus improve its benefits, outcomes, and impact. The indicators to be \nmonitored  will  have  been  formulated  and  agreed  upon  with  MOFT,  including  indicators \npertaining to physical progress and institutional reform activities. The monitoring process will \nfocus on, but not limit itself to, capacity building and O&M. The PMU will gather baseline \nphysical and socioeconomic data in each atoll and submit a detail implementation plan for \nmonitoring performance and prepare benchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence \nwithin 6 months of loan effectiveness. Thereafter, the PMU will submit semiannual monitoring \nand evaluation reports to ADB throughout project implementation.  \n \n8.  Project Review \n50.  The PMU and PIUs will regularly review and evaluate project performance, while MOFT, \nMOAD,  and  ADB  will  jointly  assess  project  implementation  at  least  once  every  year. \nParticipating island communities, island and atoll offices, and PIUs will undertake extensive \ninternal project monitoring. The Government, PMU, and ADB will conduct a comprehensive \nmidterm review 2.5 years after the Project starts or after the first phase of the settled sewerage \nsystem is implemented, whichever is sooner. The review will (i) cover the scope, design, and \nimplementation arrangements of the Project; (ii) identify changes needed since the time of \nproject  appraisal;  (iii)  assess  implementation  performance  against  project  indicators;  (iv) \nestablish  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  and  (v)  identify  problems,  constraints,  and,  if \nnecessary,  recommend  changes  in  the  design  or  implementation  arrangements.  Within  3 \nmonths of physical completion of the Project, the PMU will make publicly available a project \ncompletion report in the standard ADB format.  ", "16  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Project Benefits and Impacts \n51.  Poverty in the Maldives stems primarily from regional disparities in living conditions \nrelated to remoteness of the islands and lack of infrastructure and social services in the atolls \n(footnote  3).  Persistent  regional  income  and  non-income  inequality  must  be  reduced.  The \nProject is consistent with the Government\u2019s strategy to reduce poverty by promoting balanced \nand equitable development. The Project supports the development of regions, with focus islands \nas growth centers. The Project will provide the necessary geographic intervention to reduce \npoverty in the Maldives and will help the Government achieve the Millennium Development \nGoals  (MDGs).33  Details  on  the  action  program  and  performance  criteria  for  Regional \nDevelopment and the summary poverty reduction and social strategy are in Appendix 12 and \n13, respectively. \n \n52.  The Project will generate significant benefits at the household, community, island, atoll, \nand regional levels. Households and communities on focus islands will be direct beneficiaries of \nenvironmental infrastructure, and community mobilization components. Planning, environmental \nmanagement,  and  institutional  strengthening  components  of  the  Project  will  benefit \ncommunities, islands, atolls, and regions, and strengthen planning and management capacities \nat all levels. Benefits will include (i) protection of scarce natural resources under threat, (ii) \nimprovement of quality of life for beneficiary households and communities, (iii) empowerment of \ncommunities, and (iv) economic benefits. \n \n53.  Environment and natural resources protection. Island ecosystems are among the \nmost vulnerable in the region. Environmental degradation can render an island uninhabitable, \nincrease its vulnerability to natural disasters, and impact on key economic sectors, particularly \ntourism and fisheries. On the focus islands, unemployment is significant with only 50% of people \n15\u201364  years  old  are  employed.  Existing  income  sources  are  threatened  by  environmental \ndegradation. Protecting the marine environment is important in the atolls since primary fishing \nactivities engage 18% of the total labor force, and 98% of fisheries workers are in the atolls, \nwhere  this  sector  is  the  main  employer.  As  most  atoll  workers  are  employed  in  fishing, \nprotecting fisheries is central to any poverty strategy. The Project is a step toward meeting the \nneeds  of  current  and  future  communities.  Provision  of  rainwater  tanks  will  increase  the \navailability of clean drinking water. Support for sanitation and sewerage and integrated solid \nwaste  management  will  prevent  degradation  of  groundwater  resources  and  the  marine \nenvironment.  \n \n54.  Quality  of  Life.  The  lack  of  basic  infrastructure  and  social  services  in  the  atolls \nexacerbates income and non-income poverty. Environmental infrastructure on the focus islands \nwill  provide  basic  needs  to  vulnerable  households  and  communities.  Rainwater  tanks  will \nprovide drinking water to an initial 2,000 households, constituting over 20% of the focus islands\u2019 \npopulation. An estimated additional 5,500 tanks will be provided through a revolving fund by \n2020. The Project will target poor households, who do not have rainwater tanks and use well \nwater (which can be contaminated with fecal coliforms) or public rainwater tanks.  \n \n                                                 \n33 The Project will help achieve MDG 1 (reduce the proportion of people living on less than a dollar a day), MDG 7 \n(ensure environmental sustainability and reduce the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe \ndrinking water), and MDG 6 (combat various diseases).  ", "    17 \n55.  The Project is expected to impact on public health. The atoll population suffers from a \nhigh incidence of intestinal parasite infestation due to poor sanitation and lack of safe water, and \nabout 50\u201375% of children below 5 are affected. Poor sanitation and sewerage spread other \nwaterborne diseases such as diarrhea, while solid waste transmits disease. Households\u2014\nparticularly poor ones\u2014use much time and resources to collect water, manage solid waste, and \nattend to health problems caused by poor waste management. Most of the burden falls on \nwomen. The Project includes a gender action plan, which ensures that women will benefit from \nand implement the Project.  \n  \n56.  Improved coastal and lagoon waters will protect fish and other marine resources on \nwhich households depend for daily subsistence and nutrition, especially benefiting the poor, \nwomen, and children. Environmental infrastructure on the focus islands is expected to benefit \nover 9,000 residents, particularly the poor, who comprise over 60% of the population. The \nimprovements to water supply, sanitation and sewerage, and solid waste management on the \nfocus islands can be replicated on other islands. Environmental infrastructure will result in \nsaving and even generating resources, which will improve the quality of life and strengthen \nlivelihood opportunities. For example, increasing water supply alleviates competing water use \nfor  agriculture.  Treated  sewage  water  can  be  used  for  irrigation,  and  sewage  sludge  and \nbiodegradable solid waste for compost materials. Expanding production in backyard gardens \nwill  help  vulnerable  households  increase  their  food  security  and  incomes.  The  Project\u2019s \ncomponents will create jobs. Project design ensures pro-poor and non-gender-discriminatory \nemployment. A concerted effort to provide basic infrastructure for environmental improvement \nand social services, environmental management, and integrated land-use planning and area \ndevelopment can promote private sector activities, which will spur economic growth in the atolls. \n \n57.  Community  Empowerment.  Pre-project  consultation  confirmed  the  importance  of \nstrong links with the community in project implementation. Through the Project\u2019s community \nmobilization  component,  community  groups  will  establish  mechanisms  for  O&M  of \nenvironmental infrastructure.34 Training mechanisms and programs built into the Project will \nstrengthen  communities\u2019  capacity.  Community  participation  will  be  consolidated  through  an \nenvironmental awareness program, which will enable project beneficiaries to use sustainable \npractices, and help conserve island and marine environments.35 \n \n58.  Community participation will benefit vulnerable groups. Women have the potential to be \nactive  in  managing  solid  waste.  The  participation  of  beneficiaries  in  project  design  and \nimplementation will instill in them a sense of ownership. User charges will help establish a stake \nin the Project among users. Information and education campaigns will help raise community \nawareness on health, cleanliness, and the environment. These will reduce neglect and misuse \nof public assets and help sustain the project gains in the long run. Strong coordination and \neffective partnership to reduce disparities, particularly in the atolls, can address the high cost of \ninfrastructure and social services.  \n \n59.  Economic  Benefits.  The  environmental  infrastructure  component  will  create \nquantifiable  benefits  (marketable  goods  and  services)  as  well  as  nonquantifiable  benefits \n(improved health, welfare, and amenities). Surveys of willingness to pay have been used to \nderive consumer values for the outputs of two subcomponents. Market values are available for \n                                                 \n34 They can be the mechanism to organize direct community efforts to implement sanitation and sewerage, and solid \nwaste management schemes. \n35 The programs should maximize the potential for direct community action, particularly by schoolchildren, in \nenvironmental improvement projects, such as \u201cclean-up\u201d campaigns. ", "18  \ntwo of the three subcomponents. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the water \nsupply  subcomponent  is  35%,  and  the  average  EIRR  for  the  environmental  infrastructure \ncomponent is 18.7%. Projected cash flows suggest that the rainwater tanks and solid waste \nmanagement centers will be financially sustainable, including replacement costs of equipment \nas well as O&M. Though the surveys did not demonstrate full cost recovery for the sanitation \nand sewage treatment subcomponent, they indicate provision of sufficient resources for O&M. \nThe economic and financial analyses are in Appendix 14. \n \nB.  Assumptions and Risks \n60.  The success of the Project in meeting its goal assumes that the country\u2019s economy will \ncontinue to develop and the Government will successfully implement its regional development \nprogram.  \n \n61.  Implementation Risk. Project implementation assumes that skilled and experienced \nstaff is available for project activities. Key Government agencies do not have enough skilled \nstaff, but the project design will solve this problem through consultancies and training.  \n \n62.  Institutional Risk. Improving atoll administration assumes that (i) staff trained under the \nProject will not be transferred to other institutions; (ii) collection, analysis, and management of \nenvironmental data and drafting of land-use plans will be timely; and (iii) MOAD and the PIUs \nwill be committed to the Project and receive the resources to carry out their mandate.  \n \n63.  Operation and Maintenance Risk. Unless cooperatives are allowed to exist as legal \nentities  and  engage  in  multipurpose  activities,  sanitation  facilities  are  not  likely  to  be \nsustainable.  Once  the  draft  cooperative  regulation  becomes  effective,  communities  may \nestablish  cooperatives  to  provide  utilities,  potentially  including  electricity  and \ntelecommunications. The cooperative will increase community self-development and reduce \ndependence  on  top-down  approaches.  However,  certain  island  chiefs  may  perceive  these \ncooperatives  as  infringing  upon  their  authority  and  may  not  encourage  the  creation  of  an \nenabling  environment  for  their  adequate  functioning.  The  Government  must  ensure  that \ncooperatives can operate free of political intervention, adequate regulation is enacted and the \nappropriate Government agency has the power to protect the environment and public interest. \nThe Government should help cooperatives become financially sustainable by endorsing and \nsupporting the proposed structure and administration system. \n \n64.  Coordination with Tsunami Recovery Activities. The Government must ensure that \nactivities undertaken through the Project are adequately sequenced with the overall tsunami \nrecovery effort. Long-term institutional strengthening objectives under the Project should be \npursued within the regional development context.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n65.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the Ministry of Finance and \nTreasury have given the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that within 1 month of loan effectiveness, (a) a \nNPSC will have been established, and (b) each PIU will have been established \nand fully staffed to the satisfaction of ADB;  ", "    19 \n(ii)  RPACs will be established in each of the Focus Islands within 3 months of loan \neffectiveness; \n(iii)  The Government will not replace the PMU project director or any of the PIU \nmanagers without ADB\u2019s prior approval; \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that no physical infrastructure within the scope of \nthe Project will be constructed on Mahibadhoo, Naifaru, and Fonadhoo until the \nGovernment, through MHUDB, has approved their land-use plan. The technical \ncommittee established under MHUDB and mandated to approve land-use plans \nwill be required to assess them and either approve them or provide comments for \nreview and revision within 3 months of the plans\u2019 submission;  \n(v)  The  Government  will  provide  support  to  facilitate  IDP  formulation.  The \nGovernment  will  ensure  that,  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  each \nselected island will have (a) its IDP formulated and properly sanctioned by the \nauthorized agency, and (b) base maps completed to the satisfaction of ADB. The \nselected islands refer to those islands within the North Central, Central, and \nSouth  Central  regions,  which  will  formulate  their  land-use  plans  through  the \nProject; \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that the land-use and atoll development plans will \nbe formulated consistently and cohesively, and that they integrate the islands\u2019 \nneeds and aspirations as reflected in the IDP; \n(vii)  The Government will help establish a cooperative within each island community, \nand allow the cooperatives to plan, design, construct, operate, and maintain \n(including  impose  tariff  charges  on  end  users)  public  utilities  and  their \ninfrastructure; \n(viii)  The  Government  will  submit  to  the  Parliament,  within  2  years  of  loan \neffectiveness, the draft cooperative law, which will allow cooperatives to exist as \nlegal entities and assume the responsibility to, among other things, operate and \nmaintain public utilities; \n(ix)  The Government will ensure that no physical infrastructure in the Focus Islands \nis constructed for sanitation and solid waste management until an O&M strategy \nhas been drafted, including methodology for tariff structure and tariff collection \nand administration developed in a participatory and consultative manner; \n(x)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  throughout  project  implementation,  any \ninvoluntary resettlements will be mitigated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement,  Handbook  on  Resettlement,  and  the  proposed \nresettlement plan; \n(xi)  The Government will ensure that all environmental mitigation measures identified \nin  the  IEE  are  incorporated  into  the  project  design  and  implemented  during \nproject  construction  and  O&M,  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy,  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). The Government will also ensure \nthat environmental compliance with the above requirements and environmental \nmonitoring results collected throughout the Project are reported in the quarterly \nreports submitted to ADB; \n(xii)  The Government will ensure that women will occupy 25% of managerial positions \nin the PMU and PIUs. The Government will implement the agreed-on gender \naction plan; \n(xiii)  The Government will ensure that throughout project implementation, adequate \nbudgetary allocations of the required counterpart funds are made and approved \nand released on time; ", "20  \n(xiv)  The Government will ensure that independent external auditors will audit project \naccounts,  including  the  imprest  accounts.  The  annual  audited  accounts  and \nfinancial  statements,  together  with  audit  reports,  will  be  submitted  within  6 \nmonths following the end of the relevant Government fiscal year; \n(xv)  Before  establishing  the  imprest  accounts,  the  Government  will  appoint  an \naccountant in the PMU and each PIU; \n(xvi)  Baseline information will be collected and submitted to ADB within the first year \nof project implementation. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n66.  The following conditions are to be complied with prior to loan effectiveness: \n \n(i)   The Government will provide the necessary legal framework, through a legal \ninstrument to be issued by the President, to allow cooperatives to exist as legal \nentities and to assume, among other things, O&M of public utilities; \n(ii)   The Government will ensure that the PIU managers, whose time will be fully \ndedicated to the Project, have been appointed to the satisfaction of ADB; \n(iii)   The Government will ensure that the PMU will have been established and fully \nstaffed to the satisfaction of ADB. \n(iv)   The Government will formally approve guidelines that will define the roles and \nresponsibilities of the various stakeholders involved developing the islands and \natolls.  \n \nC.  Conditions for Loan Negotiation \n67.  The Government will ensure that the PMU project director, whose time will be dedicated \nto the Project, has been appointed to the satisfaction of ADB. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n68.

The three core Government agencies directly involved in implementation of Regional \nDevelopment Project, Phase II \u2013 Environmental Infrastructure and Management (the Project) \nare the  Ministry of Atolls Development (MOAD),  Ministry of Environment and  Construction \n(MEC), and Ministry of Health (MOH). Of these, MOAD is the primary agency responsible for \natoll development, and also for regional development in the atolls. The function of MOAD is \nchanging from atoll administration to development, in keeping with the regional development \npolicies  of  the  Government.  Atoll  and  island  administrative  agencies  are  taking  on  new \nresponsibilities and functions. \n \nB.  Project  Implementation  Capacity  of  Community  Based  Organizations,  Non-\nGovernmental Organizations, and the Private Sector.  \n3.  The choice of implementation modality may vary case by case, depending on the island, \nbut the focus will be on community-based or private sector-based solutions. Different island \ncommunities have varied organizational and management capacities of island development \ncommittees  (IDCs),  island  offices,  and  the  private  sector.  Some  IDCs  have  demonstrated \nmanagement and technical capacity to successfully undertake utility management in the long \nterm (e.g., electricity supply in Mahibadhoo), while others have do not have similar experiences \nin utility management (e.g., Naifaru). Many islands have other community-based organizations \n(such as district associations, youth clubs, or social development clubs) or a strong private \nsector that undertake community activities (such as education, electricity provision and cable \ntelevision) in lieu of the IDC or island office (e.g., Naifaru, Fonadhoo. and Gan-Laamu). \n \n4.  The lack of capacity of IDCs in planning and implementation of development projects will \nbe a serious impediment to successful implementation of the Project. The IDCs are mainly \ninvolved in the provision of social services, such as preschool education, electricity provision, \ncommunity  rainwater  tanks,  and  harbor  development.  However,  these  projects  have  been \nmainly carried out on an ad hoc basis, with a focus on service provision rather than project \nsustainability and self-sustainability. Integrated community planning, supported by strengthened \nhuman  resource  capability  of  IDCs,  specifically  in  development  planning,  monitoring  and \nimplementation, and financial management and administration, is required. In cases where ", "            Appendix 2        27 \n \ndevelopment planning has taken place, to some extent, implementation by IDCs has been \nconstrained by limited availability of development financing. Their lack of legal status is also a \nmajor  constraint  in  obtaining  loans  from  financial  institutions,  necessitating  a  Government \nguarantee, which may not be forthcoming. This issue needs to be urgently addressed, if the \nwater and sanitation and solid waste management subcomponents are to be implemented by \ncommunity-based  organizations  (CBOs).  MOAD  is  reported  to  be  working  to  develop  the \nlegislation to establish IDCs as legal entities. Within this context, the formation of community \ncooperatives  to  implement  and  manage  small-scale  improvements  to  island  services  and \nutilities will be possible. However, the normal legal process may lag behind the implementation \nof  the  Project,  and  it  should  be  fast-tracked  to  ensure  the  feasibility  of  community-based \nimplementation.   \n \n5.  Other CBOs involved in development-related initiatives are typically youth clubs, past \npupil\u2019s associations, environmental clubs, and sports clubs. However, these organizations lack \neven  the  semiformal  role  of  IDCs  and  women\u2019s  development  committees  (WDCs)  in \ndevelopment  planning  and  participation.  CBOs  are  typically  weak,  poorly  managed,  and \ninvolved in immediate community-related work, rather than long-term development activities. In \nislands with divisions between settlement districts, CBOs occasionally function as ad hoc district \norganizations that take on development functions of the IDC, such as providing preschool \nservices and electricity. CBO leadership and initiative is stronger in such situations, possibly \nbecause of the competitive spirit between districts, leading to greater community participation in \nsuch CBOs. Competition between CBOs for available public and private funds, and the drive to \ntake  on  bigger  projects  than  the  competing  CBO,  have  also  led  to  problems  such  as \nmismanagement of funds, and undertaking of inappropriate large-scale projects that end up \nbeing a financial drain on community resources.   \n \n6.  Private  sector  involvement  in  the  provision  of  social  services  is,  in  general,  poorly \ndeveloped in the atolls. While major private companies are involved in economic activities such \nas tourism and fisheries, other sectors, including the provision of social services and utilities, are \ntypically on a small scale, and have, in general, not been sustained. Past initiatives in the \nprovision of health services by private parties petered out due to expansion of the national \nhealth  service  infrastructure.  Similarly,  private  sector  provision  of  education  services  and \ninfrastructure is limited, and focused on specific sectors such as preschooling, and tuition and \nQur\u2019an classes. Private suppliers of electricity services and of cable TV services are also being \nforced out by entry of IDCs into such ventures. \n \n7.  While no established indicators measure the success of IDCs, other CBOs, and the \nprivate sector in undertaking development projects, there is great variation on the level of \ncommunity  development  between  and  within  the  atolls.  Such  variation  cannot  be  directly \nattributed to the CBOs, as there are other external factors such as Government\u2019s national \npriorities; sectoral development initiatives taken by Government agencies; and internal factors \nsuch physical, natural, human, and supporting infrastructure characteristics that come into play.   \n \nC.  Overlaps, Gaps, and Weaknesses in Institutional Framework \n \n8.  Four  fundamental  weaknesses  in  the  policy  framework  have  been  identified:  (i) \ninadequate policy integration among Vision 2020; sixth National Development Plan; Maldives \nEconomic Strategy; and sectoral, regional, atoll, and island development plans; (ii) inadequate \ndefinition of policy and planning framework for regional development; (iii) lack of operational \nobjectives,  target  setting,  and  establishment  of  measurable  performance  indicators  and \nbenchmarking to link the strategic policies to desired outputs; (iv) lack or real consensus of atoll ", "28   Appendix 2 \nand island stakeholder groups for the national population and development consolidation policy \nand its implementing mechanisms. \n \n9.  A  number  of  overlaps,  gaps,  and  weaknesses  in  mandates  and  institutional \narrangements  have  also  been  observed  in  land-use  planning,  environmental  management, \nsanitation, and water supply. Institutional analysis shows overlapping mandates and functions of \nthe Maldives Housing and Urban Development Board (MHUDB), MOAD, and the Ministry of \nPlanning  and  National  Development  (MPND),  given  that  all  three  have  some  capacity  for \nsurveying  and  land  planning.  Gaps  are  evident  in  that  land-use  planning  guidelines  and \nmonitoring mechanisms in the atolls are not articulated or established. The activities of MOAD in \nland-use  planning  in  the  islands  proceed  in  an  ad  hoc  manner  and  are  reported  to  be \ninconsistent. \n \n10.  In contrast to many other areas of environmental management, the Maldives Water and \nSanitation  Authority  (MWSA)  has  a  clear  mandate  and  responsibility  for  water  resources \nmanagement  and  supply,  including  establishing  the  regulatory  framework,  standards,  and \nenforcement arrangements for water resources use and management. There are no overlaps in \nmandate with other agencies. Weaknesses include the lack of \u201csoft\u201d institutional arrangements, \nlaws, or policies to administer water resources management, and lack of second-tier regulatory \ndevices such as standards, guidelines, and codes of practice. The technical and monitoring \nservices provided by MWSA to atoll and island populations are limited. Although broad-based \npolicies for water resources management and pollution control are expressed in environmental \nplanning  documents,  there  are  no  implementing  arrangements  to  address  them  under  the \nEnvironment Law. Thus, there is a gap in environmental controls and monitoring of water \nresources management that is neither filled by MWSA, nor by the Environment Section of MEC. \n \n11.  The institutional arrangements for sanitation and solid waste disposal are also weak, and \npoorly articulated and implemented. In this respect, while there is no overlap in the mandate of \nthe MOH, MEC and MWSA, there are distinct overlaps in work programs and projects.  There is \nambiguity as which agency is assigned the primary responsibility for solid waste management. \nWater supply and sanitation management cannot be separated from the carrying capacity of \nislands and their ecosystems, and hence must be integrated into land-use planning. \n \n12.  Overall  institutional  capacity  for  environmental  conservation  and  management  is \nconstrained by the existence of a large number of institutions mandated with the sustainable \nuse, development, and conservation of terrestrial and marine resources. While the mandates for \nterrestrial and marine resource conservation and use are shared by different agencies (MEC, \nMOFAMR, MOAD, and MOFT), coordination among these agencies on policies, strategies, and \nprograms needs to be strengthened. Gaps in the institutional structure include inadequate \nformal and nonformal vertical and horizontal linkages and mechanisms for coordinating policies, \nstrategies, and actions with respect to shared mandates and harmonization of policies and \nregulatory framework with respect to resource systems. \n \nD.  Institutional Strengthening \n \n13.  The institutional strengthening component is designed to support the Government\u2019s \npolicy of regional development and to build capacity at national and local levels to manage and \nimplement the Project. This component will focus on three major areas: (i) training and capacity \nbuilding  of  local  project implementation  units  (PIUs); (ii)  strengthening capacity  of  national \nagencies to provide technical support; and (iii) provide support to regional development. \n ", "            Appendix 2        29 \n \n \n1.

This  component  primarily  addresses  capacity  building  in  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental  management  subcomponents  and  will  be  supported  by  building  project \nmanagement  and  implementation  capacity  at  the  atoll  and  island  offices.  This  will  be \naccomplished  by  (i)  establishing  the  regulatory  framework  and  institutional  arrangements \nnecessary for devolving environmental management to the local level (local government office, \nNGO, CBO, or the private sector); (ii) training atoll and island office staff, and staff to be \nappointed in the PIUs in sector policy, project planning, and management, and the social, \ntechnical, and financial aspects of project implementation modalities; and (iii) providing the \nrequired  resources,  and  technical  support  and  field  experience  to  PIU  staff  in  project \nimplementation. PMU and other line agency consultants and staff will provide the required on-\nthe-job training, field experience, and technical assistance. \n \n2.  Strengthen Capacity of National Agencies to Provide Technical Support \n \n15.  Project management and implementation responsibilities fall primarily on three national \nagencies,  MOAD,  MHUDB,  and  MWSA.  These  agencies  have  varying  responsibilities  in \nimplementing  project  subcomponents,  primary  among  these  being  the  establishment  of \nregulatory measures and guidelines, and technical support to local agencies (or parties) working \nwithin  these  guidelines.  The  Project  is  designed  to  provide  support  for  these  agencies  to \nundertake these roles, through (i) providing technical assistance to develop and implementing \nthe  required  regulatory  measures  and  guidelines,  (ii)  assisting  line  agencies  to  build \nprofessional and technical capacity in specific areas by providing opportunities for overseas \neducation and skills development, and (iii) providing additional resources and capability to \nundertake the project components. \n \n3.  Provide Support to Regional Development \n \n16.  The Project will lend support to regional development by assisting in the development of \nthe  social  constituency  for  regional  development  in  the  Central  Regions  through  social \nmobilization and institutional strengthening inputs. Capacity building and skills development \ninputs to MOAD and atoll and island offices will promote and facilitate needs based regional \ndevelopment.  Support  will  be  provided  to  MPND  to  undertake  a  case  study  in  economic \ndevelopment planning in a selected regional growth center and atoll (e.g., Fonadhoo/Gan-\nLaamu Atoll). Capacity building of CBOs and the private sector in project implementation and \nenvironmental  management  will  enhance  their  capacity  to  participate  actively  in  regional \ndevelopment initiatives. \n \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE  \n \n  Project Name                                           Type of     Source                      Year             Amount \n                                                                                          Assistance                          Start    End            ($) \n \nA.

Project activities to organize communities for operation and maintenance in the Central \nRegions will concentrate in the first year on appointing, in each of the project implementation \nunits (PIUs), the incremental staff required, improving office facilities; and identifying potential \nqualified  nongovernmental  organizations  (NGOs)  to  facilitate  community  organization.  An \ninternational  consultant  and  a  national  consultant  will  be  appointed  to  provide  advice  and \ndevelop community organization packages, the former, and long-term advisory and training \nsupport, in the case of the latter. \n \n2.  It is expected that from the third quarter of the first year of implementation, the social \ndevelopment staff in the project management unit (PMU) and each of the PIUs, and staff of the \nNGOs identified will be trained in participatory approaches; development of criteria for selecting \ncommunities  to  organize;  community  organization;  participatory  land-use  planning;  and \npreparation of management plans for structuring, organizing, and running a cooperative. This \nstaff  will  be  sensitized  to  concerns  about  gender  and  development.  The  international  and \nnational consultants will conduct the required training through on-the-job training, workshops, \nand seminars. \n \n3.  The Project will collect baseline information on communities to prioritize them, taking \naccount of the particular needs of structures already set up for community-based management, \nsuch as the island development committees and women development committees. Information \non  communities  collected  in  the  process  of  prioritizing  targets  will  also  serve  for  project \nmonitoring and evaluation. Communities in the focus islands will be favored at initial stages of \nthe  program,  followed  by  the  communities  in  their  respective  atolls.  From  year  3  onward, \ncommunities in the remaining atolls will be assisted in community organization. \n \n4.  Organizing communities for utilities management will begin with training and advice to \npromote their cohesion. The rights, responsibilities, and customs of each community structure \nwill be elaborated and individual responsibilities clarified. Local techniques for demarcating key \nboundaries will be applied. Once the community structures are established, monthly meetings \nwill be held with leaders, representatives, and members of communities; representatives of \nhouseholds with female heads; and representatives of poor households to familiarize them with \nthe objective, components, and outputs of the Project, and the evolving regulatory framework. \nThe meetings will also offer advice the rights of different groups of users, their roles and \nresponsibilities  as  community  members,  the  benefits  of  equal  participation  by  women  and \nconflict  resolution  mechanisms,  as  well  as  provide  information  on  their  capacity  for  utility \nmanagement. These meetings will require that staff travel to the islands at times that suit the \nschedules of each community.  \n \n5.  It  is  estimated  that  approximately  6  months  will  be  required  before  the  community \nfinalizes and agrees on the approach to community-based management, and sufficient capacity \nis created among community leaders for them to  undertake such functions as monitoring, \naccounting, and bookkeeping. Inputs and outputs to be provided by the environmental engineer, \naccountant, and social development PIU staff will be identified by the international community \ndevelopment consultant, provided in the form of a program to be piloted in the focus islands, \nand refined based on experience with the assistance of the international team leader and \nfinancial  manager  specialist,  and  national  deputy  team  leader,  and  social  development \nspecialists. Thereafter, staff will continue to interact to encourage communities to formulate \nmanagement plans and build the capacity of women to participate in decision making. On their \nside, the communities will monitor their own needs and increase in capacity and will report every ", "       Appendix 4    33 \n3 months to the PIU staff. Indicators will be selected jointly among the community, PIU staff, and \nsupport consultants. Training and awareness should be contain modules such as legal status \nand formation of cooperatives, organization and structure for managing a cooperative, defining \nroles and responsibilities, and sensitizing toward the need to introduce user charges to ensure \nthe sustainability of the subcomponents.  \n \n6.  Preferably toward the end of the second year, staff on each project island will hold a \nparticipatory  workshop  to  publicize  the  results  of  community  organization  and  encourage \nfeedback. From the third year, the Project will extend its reach to other communities. At the \nsame time, however, staff will have to backstop the communities organized earlier. Project staff \nwill need to continuously work in the field in training and extension at the community level, \ntraining  women\u2019s  groups  for  full  participation,  developing  the  knowledge  and  skills  of  the \nmembers  of  community,  developing  dynamic  rules  that  will  reflect  changing  scenarios  as \ncommunity-based management systems become stronger, and evolving strategies for utility \nmanagement over time.  \n \n7.  If appropriate, from the end of the third year, communities on the focus islands will \nreceive technical advice on how to operate and maintain the sanitation and sewage treatment \nschemes, as well as solid waste management center facilities. Based on the atoll-wide strategy \nstudy  undertaken  by  the  Project,  solid  waste  collection  and  management  training  will  be \nextended to other islands. Technical training packages and manuals will be prepared by the \nteam leader in coordination with the deputy team leader, whereas the theoretical and on-the-job \ntraining will be provided by the PIU staff, initially supported by the team leader and deputy team \nleader.  \n \n ", "34  Appendix 5 \nGENDER ACTION PLAN \n1.  The  uneven  regional  development  in  the  Maldives  has  increasingly  disadvantaged \nwomen. Women\u2019s participation in the labor force has fallen from 63% in 1977 to 37% in 2002.1 \nParticipation in decision making remains low, with women accounting for only 4.8% of elected \nmembers  of  Parliament.  Traditional  attitudes,  low  access  to  higher  education,  and  limited \nemployment opportunities largely constrain women to unpaid tasks of family and community life. \n \n2.  Focus group discussions and consultations with stakeholders confirmed the major role \nwomen play in solid waste and water resource management. Women spend substantial time \nsweeping outdoors and fetching water from wells and community tanks. Active involvement in \nmanaging solid waste and water will make women the best source of information regarding \nquantity, quality, and reliability of water used, and the quantity and type of wastes generated by \nher household. Communication and interaction with women is more effective when done by \nother women. Women will be important beneficiaries of the Project and can play a valuable role \nin its implementation.  \n \n3.  During the social mobilization of communities, the importance of women\u2019s participation will \nbe explained to beneficiary communities in village meetings, hygiene education, and all other \nproject activities. The following targets will be achieved in the implementation of urban and \nenvironmental infrastructure, integrated land use planning, development of a regional growth \ncenter framework, and community mobilization:  \n \n(i)   Women will participate actively in community meetings and small group activities, \nwith women constituting 50% of participants.   \n(ii)   Half the members of the executive committees of island development committees \nwill be women. \n(iii)   Separate  discussions  will  be  undertaken  with  women\u2019s  groups  on  technologies, \nservice level of components of the Project, and social and infrastructure priorities for \nthe development of communities. If major differences occur between women\u2019s groups \nand mixed or men\u2019s groups, project facilitators will take an active role in ensuring \nwomen's opinions and decisions are reflected in project implementation. \n(iv)   In designing awareness campaigns, the role of women in the household will be taken \ninto account. \n \n4.  The Implementing Agency, Ministry of Atolls Development (MOAD), will actively recruit \nqualified  women  in  all  levels  of  the  project  implementation  structure,  especially  in  project \nimplementation units. The capacity-building component related to training will specify how the \nparticipation of women will be encouraged. The following targets will be achieved in project \nimplementation and institutional strengthening: \n \n(i)  Women  will  constitute  25%  of  professional/technical  staff  implementing  and \nmonitoring the Project.  \n(ii)  At least 30% of government staff receiving training benefits will be women. \n \n5.  MOAD will be responsible for developing and implementing appropriate strategies and action \nplans to achieve these targets. The IA will monitor these targets through project progress \nreports and the project performance management system. \n \n                                                 \n1  United Nations. 2002.

Selection Criteria for Sanitation Improvements on the Focus Islands \n \n1.  The criteria for the consideration of the most appropriate sanitation improvements are \nlisted below. Their significance as selection criteria varies from island to island in the light of \nexisting levels of development, and the options available: \n \n(i)  The best use of fresh water resources with minimum loss to island; \n(ii)  Minimum impact as source of groundwater pollution, which has to be protected \nfor long-term use; \n(iii)  Both acceptable to the community and cultural practice; \n(iv)  Affordable capital and running costs, bearing in mind the costs of paying for other \nutilities; \n(v)  Minimal impact, compatible with communal health and the costs to the island, on \nthe marine environment; \n(vi)  Application of any solutions to other islands in the Central Regions. \n \n2.  The following main considerations underlie the approach to sanitation on all islands: \n \n(i)  Sewage  and  grey  water  should  be  separated  at  source  and  disposed  of \nseparately; \n(ii)  Discharge of sewage to groundwater should be avoided in all future sanitation \nschemes, and current discharges minimized; \n(iii)  Prioritize water recharge to aquifer from grey water and treated effluent sources \n(following guidelines determining spacing between such sources and domestic \nwells); \n(iv)  All  discharges  to  the  near  shore  lagoon  environment,  treated  or  otherwise, \nshould be avoided; \n(v)  Sanitation schemes should be fully accepted by the community and as simple as \npossible; \n(vi)  Training and support in the operation and maintenance of the system must be \narranged as part of any project. \n \n3.  The following principles as a background to selections of the sanitation schemes, should \nbe adopted: \n \n(i)  Island groundwater is essential to the continued sustainability of the atolls and \nshould be protected from sewerage; \n(ii)  Low gradient simplified sewer systems are appropriate and effective for most \nislands. These are designed to carry only liquid effluent, must be used only with \nseptic tanks at household or communal level; \n(iii)  Septic tank effluent should if possible be provided with some form of secondary \ntreatment before final discharge, or piped directly to deep-water disposal. No \ndirect discharge to the near shore lagoon environment should be permitted; \n(iv)  Deep-sea discharge of treated effluent should be considered as an option where \nenvironmental standards can be satisfied; \n(v)  Reuse of treated effluent for agricultural purposes should be considered as an \noption where environmental standards can be satisfied; \n(vi)  Septage should be re-used after drying rather than disposal at sea. Composting \nwith green wastes would be preferable; \n ", "36  Appendix 6 \n(vii)  Sewage and grey water must be separated at source (at household level); this \npractice is well established but should be reinforced and explained; \n(viii)  To maintain the usability of groundwater and sustain resources, all grey water \nmust be reused by re-infiltration. \n \nB.   Summary Review of Sewerage, Sewage Treatment and Disposal Options \n \n4.  The design and construction of sewers on atolls have unique challenges due to the low \nlevel and low gradient of the terrain. Adequate gradients to allow self-cleansing conventional \nsewers to function are not readily available without using below sea-level pumped interceptors.  \nIn some cases in the Maldives where population densities are high enough and space for on-\nsite sanitation is severely limited, then self-cleansing conventional sewers similar to that used \non Mal\u00e9, can be the best solution.

Introduction \n \n1.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) was conducted for the Project, which covers \nthe North-Central, Central, and South-Central Regions (Central Regions) of the Maldives. The \nProject is classified as under category B in accordance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nGuidelines  Assessment  Environmental.  The  Project  will  have  no  significant  negative \nenvironmental effect. The project activities with marginal environmental impacts and proposed \nmitigation measures are summarized in this summary IEE. Overall, the Project is expected to \nresult in substantial environmental benefits. The objective is the Project is to enhance regional \nplanning and improve environmental and land management through a community-centered \napproach. This will be achieved through the provision of (i) basic environmental and social \ninfrastructure to the poor on a least-cost yet sustainable basis, (ii) planned development and \nexpansion of island settlements, and (iii) increased environmental awareness and capacity for \naddressing local environmental management. \n \nB.   Description of Project Components \n \n2.  Main  components  to  be  financed  by  ADB  include  (i) improving  environmental \ninfrastructure,  (ii)  strengthening  planning  and  environmental  management,  and  (iii)  building \nmanagement and implementation capacity in the Central Regions. Facilities will be provided \nbased  on  projected  population  needs  in  2020.  The  sanitation  and  sludge  management \ncomponent  will  comprise  integrated  settled  sewerage  schemes  for  the  two  focus  islands \n(Fonadhoo  and  Mahibadhoo),  consisting  of  a  combination  of  septic  tanks,  and  small-bore \nsewerage. Treatment options involve treatment in reed beds. This will be followed by recharge \non land as a water conservation measure, provided World Health Organization (WHO) drinking \nwater standards are met, direct discharge to deep-sea water, provided World Bank effluent \ndischarge standards are met, or reuse for agricultural purposes. Discharge to the sea has been \nconsidered as an appropriate option to follow treatment, as this would result in rapid dilution and \nassimilation of any remaining nutrients and would prevent existing lagoon pollution. Sludge from \nseptic tanks will be dried in special drying beds and further used for composting with green \nwastes has been proposed. \n \n3.  The solid waste management component will pilot an integrated scheme on the three \nfocus islands, where waste segregation is to be conducted at household level, solid waste \ncollection, processing, and recycling will take place in a single waste management center, \nfollowed  by  transshipment  of  wastes  of  commercial  value.  The  land-use  planning  and \ndevelopment component will provide land-use plans for 24 islands and focus on provision of \nsustainable  levels  of  population  and  housing  growth;  optimal  patterns  of  infrastructure \ndevelopment; and conservation of the groundwater aquifer, coastlines, and other ecologically \nimportant areas.  \n \nC.   Description of the Environment \n4.  The 1,192 low-lying coral islands of the Maldives archipelago extend over 26 atolls \ncovering 115,300 square kilometers (km2). The islands stretch over a distance of 860 kilometers \n(km) north to south, and 130 km east to west. The average area of the 199 inhabited islands is \n57.8 hectares (ha) and only three islands exceed an area of 400.0 ha. The maximum elevation \nis below 3 meters (m) above mean sea level and most (80%) of the land is less than 1 m above \nmean high-tide level. Thirteen of the atolls lie within the three Central Regions. Inside the atolls, ", "       Appendix 7  39\nwater depth is generally less than 80 m. The islands comprise layers of unconsolidated shell \nand coral sand and debris, lying on coral rock, which are normally less than 10 m below the \nsurface. Soils are thin (20 centimeters or less) freely draining and highly alkaline. There is \nabundant calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus, and sufficient iron. The tropical climate is \ndominated by two monsoon periods. Temperature is 25\u221230 Celsius (oC), and rainfall is about \n2,000 millimeters per annum. Water on the islands occurs almost entirely as groundwater within \nthe aquifer that overlies the coral rock. \n \n5.  The Maldives displays a pristine marine environment. The well-being of the coral reef is \nof concern at national and international levels. Marine biological diversity is exceptional and \nconsidered to be one of the world\u2019s richest ecosystems. There are 187 species of coral, 1,090 \nrecognized species of fish, and almost 300 species of marine algae. There are also seven \nspecies of dolphins, nine species of whales, and five species of turtles, all of which endangered. \nThe diversity of terrestrial ecosystems is limited by the smallness of the land areas, shallowness \nof the soil, and the high soil salinity.  In spite of this, more than 260 native species of flora are \nrecorded, and 18 species of birds are now protected under the Environmental Law. From 1995 \nto 1999, 25 protected marine areas were delineated in the Maldives. \n \nD.   Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n1.  Location \n \n6.  The  Project\u2019s  sanitation  and  sewage  schemes  are  on  islands  where  sewage  is \ndischarged into lagoons. Location of reed beds (below ground level), requiring large areas, and \nsludge drying beds may result in potential odor problems in a confined island context. The \nlocation  of  such  facilities  will  be  selected  in  consultation  with  authorities  and  the  local \npopulation. A buffer zone with appropriate vegetation will be incorporated, where possible, to \nattenuate nuisance and improve aesthetics. \n \n7.  The proposed waste management centers can give rise to noise, traffic, and unpleasant \nodors. In addition to avoiding residential areas, where possible, the site will be selected taking \ninto account prevailing wind directions. The center should be in the coastal area, above the \nmaximum high-tide level. Deposition bays receiving segregated household wastes for each of \nthe schemes will be positioned conveniently to allow households easy access, while minimizing \nvisual impact and potential odor problems. \n \n2.  Design  \n \n8.  Pipe sizing and material selection to meet projected demands will be carefully selected \nto ensure no leakage, scheme impairment, or soil contamination. Accessibility for repair and de-\nblocking activities will also be considered for engineering design. In order to prevent potential \ncontamination resulting from inadequate mixing and dispersion of sewage effluent discharge \ninto deep-sea water, the discharge location will be carefully identified based on variations in \nmarine current direction, depth, tidal stage and season, as well as interflow between lagoon and \nsea.1 Monitoring will be conducted to ensure that no physical or chemical imbalances affect \nbiological and ecosystem activity. The waste management site will be equipped to prevent the \nspread of collected waste outside the containment area, and monitoring mechanisms will ensure \nappropriate waste segregation. \n \n                                                 \n1  A separate hydrological study will be undertaken. \n ", "40   Appendix 7 \n3.   Construction \n \n9.  The  effects  of  trenching  for  settled  effluent  sewerage  system  will  be  minimal  at \nFonadhoo  and  Mahibadhoo,  as  the  depth  needed  is  shallow.  All  excavation  is  above \ngroundwater level, less than 1.2 m deep. If found necessary, dewatering have to be carefully \nmonitored. Use of small pumps and other efforts will be made to recharge any locally pumped \ngroundwater to prevent induced salinity intrusion, which would affect household wells in the \nvicinity. Re-injection or re-infiltration of groundwater removed by pumping during excavation \nworks to keep the ground dry during construction must be stipulated in the construction contract.  \n \n10.  Excavation  and  anchoring  activities  in  the  lagoon  and  any  works  leading  to  the \nconstruction  of  a  marine  effluent  discharge  pipeline  could  lead  to  undesired  turbidity  and \nsedimentation.  Equipment  selection  will  take  this  factor  into  account.  Moreover,  works  will \npreferably take place when tidal flushing is sufficient to avoid damage to the reef or lagoon \nenvironment. Access will be disrupted during construction activities. In addition, noise, vibration, \nand  dust  generation  are  likely  to  affect  the  population  during  construction.  Contractors\u2019 \ntemporary plant, equipment storage, and living quarters can also be short-term environmental \nhazards.  Good  health  and  hygiene  practices  at  work  and  reduced  work  accidents  will  be \nachieved by means of an occupational health and safety plan, which will include emergency \nplans, personnel basic training, first aid provisions, a comprehensive domestic solid waste \nmanagement plan, and sanitation facilities for the construction camp. The supply of power for \nthe solid waste facility schemes will involve burial of power cables (or suspension of power \ncables from poles), to be designed in a nonintrusive manner.  Water supply could be provided \nfrom an on-site shallow well located to minimize danger from leachate contamination. \n \n4.  Operation  \n \n11.  The success of the sanitation systems hinges partly on the adequate use of the septic \ntanks, whether domestic or communal. An important feature of good operation and maintenance \n(O&M) includes regular desludging of tanks, which could cause short-term odor problems. The \nappropriate functioning of reed beds and the overall sanitation scheme relies on preventing any \ntoxic  harmful  substances,  other  than  domestic  sewage,  from  entering  the  system.  Good \npractices will be disseminated through a dedicated public awareness campaign. Appropriate \noperation  and  maintenance  of  sewers,  sewage  pumping  stations,  or  reed  bed  treatment \nsystems will ensure no unpleasant odors are generated. Sludge disposal (composting enhancer \nor fertilizer) must be conducted and distributed adequately to prevent water and soil pollution. \nDischarge from the desludging tanker onto drying beds may cause short-term odor impacts.   \n \n12.  Minor increases in road traffic caused by the disposal and collection of waste from bays \nare not expected to be significant in terms of road safety and/or noise generation. Operational \nproblems from odor caused by temporarily stored putrescible wastes may occur. Leachate \ngeneration is unlikely to occur, provided waste is not stored for more than 1\u20132 weeks, Limited \ndanger of groundwater pollution is foreseen as the natural flow is seaward. Impermeable floor \nconcreting for the waste management center will prevent soil and groundwater pollution.  \n \nE.   Environmental Monitoring Plan and Institutional Requirements  \n \n13.  Technical  and  institutional  mitigation  measures  will  be  incorporated  in  the  detailed \ndesign of the Project. Measures of a planning, functional, institutional, and procedural character \nhave to be included in the site selection criteria, tender documents, and Occupational Health \nSafety Plan. Mitigation measures related to construction will be stated in the contract with the ", "       Appendix 7  41\ncontractor,  who  will  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  its  own  environmental \nmanagement  plan.  The  project  management  unit,  Ministry  of  Atolls  Development,  will  be \nresponsible for monitoring and enforcement during construction. During the operational phase, \nthe Maldives Water and Sanitation Authority will be responsible for implementing environmental \nmeasures in the sector of water and sanitation, and Ministry of Construction and Public Works \nand the Ministry of Environment and Construction (MEC) will be responsible for implementing \nenvironmental measures in the solid waste management sector. MEC will be responsible for \noverseeing  overall  environmental  compliance  and  general  ecosystems  and  environmental \nmonitoring.  \n \n14.  MOAD will request two independent assessments of environmental performance during \nthe project period by a random sampling of project schemes and will focus on (i) compliance \nwith environmental screening and related requirements, (ii) use of environmental guidelines for \nplanning and development, (iii) satisfactory monitoring by the island office, (iv) satisfactory \nsupervision by the contractors; (v) good general level of project environmental performance, (vi) \nand the O&M status of constructed facilities. The results of these assessments will be sent to \nthe ADB for review. ADB will assess environmental compliance during its review missions. The \nenvironmental  monitoring  plan  includes  provisions  for  monitoring  (i)  groundwater  level,  (ii) \ngroundwater  quality  (salinity  and  anthropogenic  pollution),  (iii)  terrestrial  ecosystems  and \nbiodiversity, (iv) coastal erosion, (v) aquatic reef and lagoon ecosystems and biodiversity. \n \nF.   Public Consultation and Disclosure  \n \n15.  Meetings to discuss environmental matters were held with residents, including women, \natoll and island officials for each of the focus islands, Government agencies and the United \nNations (UN) agencies in Male. For each island, the lack of an adequate sewerage system was \nseen  as  a  priority  concern,  together  with  the  problem  of  unmanaged  solid  waste.    Other \nsecondary concerns included shortage of communal rainwater tank storage, and the need for \nstreet paving. \n \nG.   Findings, Recommendations, and Conclusions \n \n16.  Operationally, changes in sewage disposal practices from the current discharge of raw \nsewage directly or by infiltration into lagoons, to deep-sea discharge of treated sewage effluent \nor re-use by recharge, will have significant positive environmental impacts. The treated waste is \nrelatively  small  in  volume,  and  opportunity  for  dilution  is  large.  Nevertheless,  optimizing \ndischarge  location  will  mitigate  any  potential  negative  impact  on  the  marine  environment. \nReuse, recycling, and composting will be encouraged through the formulation of a solid waste \nmanagement strategy at the atoll level. Recommendations will be incorporated into the design \nof the solid waste management centers, in this way preventing soil and groundwater table \npollution, as well as reducing or eradicating burning of waste and associated air pollution. \n \n17.  The land-planning component offers ample opportunities for an environmentally aware \nuse of island land resources. It also provides an opportunity for the development of improved \nguidelines  for  the  use,  O&M  of  on-site  sanitation.  The  proposed  groundwater  pollution \ninvestigation will provide valuable guidance for spacing drinking water and sanitation facilities. \nThere are some minor and short-term potentially adverse impacts due to sanitation and solid \nwaste  management  center  construction,  which  are  controllable  through  enforcement  of \nappropriate construction contract conditions.  \n ", " \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \nTable A8.1: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan  4\n2\n($ \u2018000)   \nItem Total Cost ADB Financed Government\nFX LC Total FX LC Total LC Total   Ap\nA.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Maldives: \n \nPoverty in the Maldives stems primarily from regional disparities in living conditions related to remoteness of the \nislands and lack of infrastructure and social services in the atolls.1 A growing population in the atolls is becoming \nincreasingly vulnerable. The Government\u2019s sixth National Development Plan and Poverty Reduction Strategy places \nemphasis on balanced and equitable development. The Government\u2019s two-pronged strategy involves the development \nof regional centers with good infrastructure and social services complemented by focus islands to serve as service \nhubs and growth centers. In parallel, special targeted income support programs will be established.2 \n \nPoverty reduction requires reducing persistent regional income inequality and non-income disparities. There is an \nacute  lack  of  employment  opportunities  in  the  atolls.  Existing  income  sources  are  also  threatened  due  to \nenvironmental degradation. With regard to non-income inequality, there is a lack of access to electricity, transport, \ncommunications, education, health, potable drinking water, recreation facilities, and selected consumer goods; there is \nuneven quality of housing and the natural environment; and there is widespread incidence of food security and \nmalnutrition  in  the  atolls.  Facilitating  sustainable  livelihoods,  protecting  current  livelihood  sources  through \nenvironmental improvement, and the provision of basic infrastructure and social services in the atolls is clearly \nrequired to reduce poverty. \n \nThe  Project  will  reduce poverty  through three  components:  (i)  improving environmental  infrastructure  covering \nsanitation and sewerage improvements, provision of rainwater tanks, and integrated solid waste management; (ii) \nstrengthening planning and environmental management including integrated land-use planning and management, \nformulation of an economic development framework study for regional growth centers, developing environmental \nawareness programs, and environmental monitoring; and (iii) building management and implementation capacity \ncovering community mobilization facilitation, and institutional strengthening.  \n \nThe  country\u2019s  island  ecosystems  are  among  the  most  vulnerable.  Environmental  problems  are  rapidly  being \nmanifested in the depletion and pollution of groundwater; 3 pollution of the coastal environment due to inadequate \nsewage and solid waste disposal; and marine resource depletion. Addressing environmental issues is crucial in island, \natoll, and regional development. Environmental degradation can render an island uninhabitable, increase an island\u2019s \nvulnerability to natural disasters, and have impacts on key economic sectors particularly tourism and fisheries.4 The \nProject will develop sanitation and sewerage systems, and integrated solid waste management in the focus islands. \nMany  islands  in  the  Maldives  have  run  out  of  groundwater,  and  the  little  that  they  have  is  either  saline  or \ncontaminated. One quarter of the population is reported to have no access to safe drinking water, and half of the \npopulation depends on rainwater as their source of drinking water. While rainwater is considered safe, the quality of \nrainwater  tanks  affect  the  quality  of  water.  Households  with  no  rainwater  tanks  use  well  water  that  may  be \ncontaminated with fecal coliforms. One fifth of the population does not use sanitary means of excreta disposal, and \npoor hygiene has significant implications on health and the environment.5 Protecting environmentally sensitive areas \nand resources in the island and ensuring sustainable levels of development will be supported by the Project through \ndeveloping land-use plans in 24 islands. \n \nThe lack of capacities of local authorities and communities in the atolls and islands has constrained development. Due \nto this lack of capacity, the needs of communities in the atolls for social service and infrastructure development have \nbeen determined at the central level. Partnership with civil society and other stakeholders will be enhanced through \nthe Project. It will facilitate decentralized decision making and community empowerment. Strong coordination and \neffective partnership to reduce disparities, particularly in the atolls, can address the high costs of infrastructure and \nsocial services.  \n \nA concerted effort to provide basic infrastructure for environmental improvement, and social services; environmental \nmanagement; and integrated land-use planning and area development can promote private sector activities that will \nspur economic growth in the atolls. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

Poverty Analysis                                                                                                     Poverty Classification \n   \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  Poverty Intervention \n \n \nBoth income and non-income poverty exists in the Maldives. While there is no official poverty line, a vulnerability and \npoverty assessment assessed income poverty using three poverty lines Rf7.5 ($0.59), Rf10 ($0.78) and Rf15 ($1.17).6 \nUsing these thresholds, the resulting poverty headcounts are 15%, 22%, and 43%, respectively. The overall picture \ndoes not show the high degree of regional income inequality in the country. An estimated 70% of the population \noutside Male have incomes equivalent to only the least wealthy 20% in Male. In comparison with Male, the country\u2019s \ncapital, the ratio of incomes in Male compared with the atolls is 2:1, with the ratio increasing to 3:1 when lowest \naverage per capita income is considered. There are also high degrees of inequality in terms of social and physical \ninfrastructure and services. This inequality is estimated at 4:1 on average between Male and the atolls. In addition, \npoverty may further increase following the tsunami disaster. \n \nThe Project will be undertaken in the central, north central, and south central regions, comprising 124 islands in 13 \natolls. Interventions will initially concentrate on the focus islands of Fonadhoo-Gan, Mahibadoo, and Naifaru whose \npopulations in 2000 were 3,984; 1,714; and 3,707, respectively. These areas are considerably poorer than Male. \nBased on the 2000 census, while 44% of persons in Male had incomes less than Rf500 per month, the percentages in \nFonadhoo,  Mahibadhoo,  and  Naifaru  were  64.2%,  63.7%,  and  57.8%  respectively.  The  focus  islands  are \ncharacterized by high dependency ratios (80\u2212100 compared with 81 in Male); low levels of employment (52\u221255% on \naverage with females at lows of 33\u221236% compared with males at 72\u221277%); and lack of access to education beyond \ngrade 10. With the exception of Mahibadhoo, the focus islands experience negative net migration reflecting the lack of \njobs. \n \nThe focus islands have a high dependence on rainwater as a source of drinking water (86\u221299%) and generally \nconsume water that is not treated (78-98%). With regard to sanitation, in Fonadhoo and Gan, while 70% and 45% \nhave toilets connect to septic tanks or latrines, 15% and 28% use areas of the beach as toilets. In Naifaru, 84% have \ntoilets connected directly to the sewer and to the sea, while 2.1% are connected to septic tanks or latrines.  \n \nDuring project preparation, a survey of 158 households which shows further non-income aspects of poverty related to \nthe interventions proposed under the Project. The survey shows that water shortages were experienced for 0.3 to 2 \nmonths in the project focus islands. Among those who used public rainwater tanks, or mosque or public wells as a \nwater resource, an average of 2-3 trips per day were made to fetch water. Some respondents reported that there were \nproblems in drinking water quality such as taste, bad odor and color. Respondents proposed the provision of rainwater \ncatchments and tanks to more households. The survey reflects a lack of proper sanitation in the project focus islands. \nIn Fonadhoo and Mahibadhoo, most toilets are connected to septic tanks or latrines. However, there are households \nwithout toilet facilities in Fonadhoo and Gan. As many as 13% and 21% of respondents reported using the beach as \ntoilets in Fonadhoo and Gan, respectively. The surveys show that households strongly felt that groundwater is being \ndepleted and becoming contaminated due to bad sewerage systems. Households had different responses to the \nquestion  on  solid  waste  disposal.  In  Naifaru,  all  respondents  reported  discharging  into  designated  areas.  In \nMahibadhoo, 58% reported discharging in designated areas and there was a large proportion which burned solid \nwaste. In Fonadhoo and Gan, a large percentage\u201463% and 41%, respectively\u2014discharged solid waste on beaches \nor areas of dense vegetation. \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \n3  Soil is poor and highly porous, hence infiltration of rainwater is often immediate, with rainwater forming a lens that \nfloats on the saltwater table that rises and falls with the tide. This lens is the only source of water on small coral \nislands. Susceptible to rapid depletion and pollution caused by human activities. Exhaustion or contamination can \ncause irreparable damage rendering an island unfit for human habitation. \n4  About 18% of the total labor force is engaged in primary fishing activities. It is the second largest Maldivian \nemployment category after government. The vulnerability and poverty assessment analysis on the distribution of \nsectoral employment indicates that 98% of employment in the fisheries sector is found in the atolls, where it is the \nbiggest employer. Fishing remains the biggest employing activity in the outer island and is central to any poverty \nstrategy.  \n5  There is a very high incidence of intestinal parasite infestation. This affects 50\u201375% of children below 5, and is \nlinked to poor sanitation and to lack of potable and safe water supply on many islands.  \n6  United Nations Development Programme and Ministry of Planning and National Development. 1998.

Participation Process   \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nStakeholders include residents in the islands, island level community-based organizations (island development \ncommittee, women\u2019s development committee, and other organizations to be formed for maintaining sewerage and \nsanitation, and solid waste management facilities), atoll development committees, government agencies (ministries of \nfinance and treasury, atolls development, construction and public works, planning and national development; Maldives \nHousing and Urban Development Board; Maldives Water and Sanitation Authority); and multilateral organizations. \nRoles, responsibilities, and interests have been identified. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe Project is designed to undertake all components in a participatory manner, involving communities at the center of \nregional development. Communities do not have the strong absorptive capacity of communities needed to implement \nand sustain the project components. Civil society should partner with the Government. It is necessary to define a clear \nrole for community-based organizations (CBOs) so that the sector does not expand in an ad hoc, uncoordinated \nmanner. A component of the Project will facilitate the mobilization of communities to form CBOs. As a channel for \nempowering people, community-based organizations can address a perceived need and common interest within the \ncommunity bringing large benefits, particularly in terms of social capital formation (development of a group-based \ncapacity to solve problems). Mobilizing CBOs and coordinating effective partnership with the Government will reduce \nthe high cost of infrastructure and social services in the atolls. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nUneven regional development has increasingly disadvantaged women. Women will be beneficiaries in the Project \nprimarily through improved living conditions at home, reduced burden for solid waste management and water \ncollection, and reduced risks from certain diseases and related costs. Women can play an important role in \nimplementation. The Project can provide women access to decision-making structures, jobs, income-generating \nactivities, and opportunities to instigate and manage activities related to the Project\u2019s components.

The Project has three closely interrelated components: (i) environmental infrastructure, (ii) \nplanning  and  environmental  management,  and  (iii)  management  and  implementation  capacity \nbuilding. The economic and financial analyses concentrate on evaluating the direct impact that the \nenvironmental  infrastructure  component  will  have  on  the  Central  Regions\u2019  economy  by  (i) \nimproving  sanitation  and  sewerage,  (ii)  supplying  safe  drinking  water,  and  (iii)  providing  an \nintegrated solid waste management system. In addition to these quantifiable benefits, the Project is \nexpected  to  have  substantial  nonquantifiable  benefits  due  to  improved  health,  welfare,  and \namenities, community mobilization, training, and gender-related activities.  \n \n2.  The economic analysis has been conducted following the Guidelines for the Economic \nAnalysis  of  Projects  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  Financial  sustainability  of  the \nsubprojects  was  assessed  based  on  the  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and \nManagement  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank.  A  least-cost \nanalysis was undertaken for the sanitation and sewage treatment subcomponent while a cost-\nbenefit analysis was carried out for the sanitation and sewage treatment, solid waste management, \nand water supply subcomponents. The subprojects are evaluated over 20 years, with no salvage \nvalue assumed thereafter. \n \nB.  Approach and Methodology \n \n3.  Quantifiable benefits and costs were examined based on comparison of the with- and \nwithout-project scenarios. Financial prices used in the analyses were identified through survey \ninformation  from  the  project  area,  as  described  in  the  feasibility  study,  or  provided  by  the \nGovernment. Economic prices were derived as follows: \n  \n(i)  an exchange rate of $1 = Rf12.75 has been applied throughout; \n(ii)  prices are based on 2004 prices and adjusted in financial costs using an annual \ndomestic inflation rate of 1% and World Bank index projections for foreign costs; \n(iii)  economic analysis is made at constant 2004 prices; \n(iv)  economic analysis excludes taxes and duties; \n(v)  economic prices use the domestic price numeraire and a standard exchange rate \nfactor (SERF) of 1.11 is applied to the price of tradable goods; \n(vi)  the economic life of the project is taken as 20 years including 5 years project \nimplementation; and \n(vii)  all plant, equipment, and furniture are assumed to be replaced on average every 10 \nyears through the project life. \n \nIn  addition, it must  be highlighted that the  analyses  below  were conducted  based  on \nwillingness  to  pay  collected  in  2004.  Although  tsunami  affected  communities  may  encounter \ndifficulties in paying user fees in the short term, their ability to pay is expected to be restored by the \ntime the Project is completed. \n \nC.   Economic Analysis \n \n  1.  Water Supply \n \n4.  The  water  supply  subcomponent  will  provide  a  rainwater  collection  credit  component \nprogram to assist individual households in the Central Regions to purchase 2,500-liter rainwater \n ", "56  Appendix 14 \nstorage tanks, increasing the ability to meet their needs during dry periods.1 Credit will be provided \nin the form of a revolving fund and repaid by households at zero interest cost. The subcomponent \nwill increase the stock of drinking water available to cover dry periods, providing 11.5 additional \ndays of consumption at the observed daily per capita consumption of 36 liters in the target atolls. A \nstudy of rainfall patterns in Laamu Atoll2 indicates that dry periods of 4 or more days account for \n172 days per year distributed (Table 14.1). \n \nTable A14.1: Dry Periods and Opportunity Cost of Drinking Water \n \nItem  Probability \nDry Period Days  4 to 5  6 to 8  9 to 11  12 to 14  15 days + \nDays Per Year  45.45  43.40  20.00  22.10  41.20 \nMaldivian Rufiyaa per liter   0.04  0.06  0.08  0.10  0.10 \nProbability of Tank Supplies  1.00  0.75  0.50  0.25  0.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n5.  Economic benefit calculations were based on the following computations: (i) displaced cost \nof desalinated water sold ex-standpipe at Rf2 per 20 liter container (Rf0.1/liter)3 during such dry \nperiods, and (ii) displaced marginal transportation costs. 4 On this basis, the rainwater tanks will \nprove strongly viable. Under the above assumptions, a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of \n29%, and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 26% were calculated for each individual tank. \nLags between repayment of loans and relending by the fund are expected to be short, but will \nreduce  the  overall  EIRR  to  24.9%.  Non-repayment  will  reduce  the  size  of  the  funds  for \nreinvestment rather than reduce the rate of return. \n \n6.  It is assumed that the provision of safe drinking water will be responsible for substantial \nimprovements in health, the economic benefits calculations allow for further computations for  (i) \ndisplaced  waterborne  diseases  health  treatment  costs  (averaged  at  Rf400  in  surveyed  focus \nislands);  (ii)  displaced  loss  of  income  resulting  from  acute  diarrhea  and  waterborne  disease \nsymptoms,5 yielding an revised EIRR of 35%. \n \n7.   Assuming a 90% repayment rate with installments over 5 years, the funds provided by the \nproject will directly finance 2,750 new water tanks and reuse in the revolving fund is expected to \nfinance a further 10,000 over the 20-year project period. Under these circumstances, the FIRR for \neach individual beneficiary will be much higher, up to 60% with interest-free installments over 5 \nyears.  \n \n  2.  Sanitation and Sewage Treatment and Disposal \n \n8.  The sewerage and sewage treatment subcomponent is designed to collect, treat, and safely \ndispose of domestic wastewater from the two selected islands. A least-cost analysis was carried \n                                                 \n1  Yearly water shortages range from 35.5% in Fonadhoo to 54% in Mahibadhoo. Periods can be up to 2 months. \n2  2001. Special Programme for Food Security in The Maldives, Food and Agriculture Organization, Male.  \n3  This price is assumed to apply in long dry periods. The value of tank water at the beginning of dry periods is less and \nassumed to be 40% of this level on the 4th and 5th days of dry spells, increasing to Rf 0.1/liter from the 12th dry day. \nIn the without-tank case, the existing storage will provide water for the first few days, and incremental supply is \nassumed to arise from the 4th day. At the 36 liter per capita consumption rate identified in project preparation, the \n2,500 liter tank would be emptied in 11 days, and the with-project combination of existing and new storage is assumed \nto be emptied by day 15, leaving 41 days per year without tank supplies. The tank is not always full when dry periods \nbegin and the probability of the tank being able to supply water is assumed to decline. \n4  Additional transportation costs are incurred. However, given that cost is not wholly attributable to water supplies and \ninvolves purchase of other goods, this is considered to be negligible. \n5  Diarrhea and waterborne disease are reported to affect 9.5% of the population. Loss of workdays due to the \nwaterborne diseases was reported in the socioeconomic surveys to be equal to 7%. ", "  Appendix 14  57 \nout for the Naifaru6 sanitation and sewage treatment subcomponent, where the following options \nwere  examined:  (i)  settled  effluent  sewerage  system,  including  reed  beds  and  sea  outfall \nprincipally;  and  (ii)  a  conventional  sewerage  system,  including  a  sewer  network,  wastewater \ntreatment package plants and a sea outfall. The least-cost analysis demonstrated that the first \noption was the best option. Based on engineering design criteria and the findings from the Naifaru \nstudy, settled sewerage facilities for the treatment of liquid waste for Mahibadoo and Fonadhoo \nwere selected. \n \n9.  Capital costs and incremental operation and maintenance (O&M) costs for each subproject \nhave been considered. Cost-benefit analysis computations for the settled sewerage systems are \nbased  on  (i)  surveyed  willingness  to  pay;  and  (ii)  benefits  associated  with  the  provision  of \nalternative sources of water for non-drinking purposes, such as irrigation, livestock drinking, and \ntoilet flushing. Cost-benefit calculations appear weak when based exclusively on the willingness-to-\npay survey undertaken during the survey. This reflects (i) the absence of reported charges for \nsewerage services in the Maldives,7 and thus, the absence of real context in which respondents \ncould frame their answers and; (ii) the necessity to review and develop further willingness-to-pay \nexpressions to account for the large proportion of the population that would be willing to pay more \nthat  Rf125,  given  that  when  solely  based  on  charges,  an  estimated  minimum  of  Rf300  (for \nMahibadoo) would be required to recover costs. \n \nTable A14.2: Sewerage Improvement: Willingness to Pay \n \nWillingness-to-Pay Rates  Mahibadhoo  Fonadhoo / Gan  Combined Systems \n(Rf per household per month)  (%)  (%)  (%) \nRf  >125  58.3  75.0  66.7 \nRf 65\u2013124  41.7  18.8  30.2 \nRf < 65  0.0  6.2  3.1 \nSource: Capacity Building for Regional Development Project, Phase II PPTA Survey. \n \n10.  Islands  commonly  use  simple  irrigation8  in  home  gardens  with  multi-storey  cropping \nsystems, producing fruits and vegetables for household food security and for sale. When estimated \nbenefits gained from the reuse9 of treated water for irrigation of basic agriculture systems, such as \nhome  gardens  providing  essential  products  for  consumption  at  household  level,  hydroponics, \nlivestock or appropriate household needs such as flushing toilets, are used  in the cost-benefit \nanalysis alongside willingness-to-pay values, an overall EIRR of 3.5% is obtained.  Improved \nsewerage and sanitation benefits include nonquantifiable benefits in terms of health, welfare, and \namenities, requiring sewerage development in the environmentally fragile context of small coral \nislands with increasing populations. \n \n3.  Integrated Solid Waste Management  \n \n11.  The principal thrust of this subcomponent is to halt and reverse environmental degradation \n                                                 \n6  An investment proposal was initially put forward for this island. A reduction in the project scope and resources has \npostponed investment activities. A comparison of average incremental economic costs initially computed in the \nfeasibility study showed settled sewerage values to be 85% of those for conventional sewerage.  \n7  In Male, sewerage tariffs are jointly charged with the water supply charges. This approach is not possible for the purely \nsewerage services proposed. \n8  Islands commonly use simple irrigation in home gardens with multi-storey cropping systems, producing fruits and \nvegetables for household food security and for sale. With limited land and water, Government is promoting higher \nvalue agriculture, including hydroponics. \n9  Market information or WTP data regarding benefits from water reuse could not be obtained for the Maldives and \ntherefore  typical  information  from  existing  elsewhere  schemes  has  been  used.  This  includes  the  following \nassumptions: (i) losses to evaporation are less than 20%, (ii) estimated demand for treated water of at least 70%, (iii) \nMRf 0.01 per liter = value of treated water. \n ", "58  Appendix 14 \ncaused by inadequate solid waste management practices in the atolls. Solid waste management \ncenters for Naifaru, Mohibadoo and Fonadhoo-Gan are envisaged under the Project, where most \nwaste generated in the islands and atolls will either be reprocessed and stored for local use \n(composting of greens, recycling and reuse of inerts), or stored for transshipment. \n \n12.  Cost-benefit calculations were based on (i) the value of recycled materials and (ii) proposed \nuser  charges.  User  charge  values  were  obtained  from  Government  sources,  currently  in  the \nprocess  of  introducing  solid  waste  management  fees  of  Rf  50  per  household  per  month  in \ndevelopments in the Northern and Southern Regions, indicating an overall willingness to pay. \nAssuming that some unwillingness to pay, collection of charges were limited to 80%.  \n \nTable A14.3: EIRR and Sensitivity of Solid Waste Developments \n \n Item  Combined \nNaifaru  Mahibadhoo  Fonadhoo / Gan \n  Centers \nMain Parameters, 2005           \nHouseholds  683  339  921  1,943 \nWaste Generated (tons)  1,162  538  1,107  2,807 \nBase Case           \nNPV @ 12 %        ($)  62,821  (-83,389)  (-27,959)  (-39,593) \nEIRR  29.4%  neg.  8.2%  9.0% \nCollection % @ Rf 50           \n100%  40.0%  neg.  15.5%  17.2% \n90%  34.8%  neg.  12.0%  13.3% \nBase = 80%  29.4%  neg.  8.2%  9.0% \n60%  18.2%  neg.  neg.  neg. \n50%  12.0%  neg.  neg.  neg. \nCharge @ 80% collection           \nRf100  70.9%  11.8%  33.6%  37.3% \nRf  60  37.9%  neg.  14.2%  15.7% \nRf  56  34.6%  neg.  11.9%  13.2% \nBase = Rf  50  29.4%  neg.  8.2%  9.0% \nRf  40  20.6%  neg.  0.6%  0.2% \nRf  31  11.7%  neg.  neg.  neg. \nPV of Cash Flows @ 12%  $ \nValue of Recycled Waste  115,635  53,464  96,154  265,253 \nHousehold Charges  130,472  69,190  175,898  375,561 \nSite O&M Costs  (-145,633)  (-157,213)  (-168,883)  (-471,729) \nCapital Cost  (-100,025)  (-92,543)  (-242,141)  (-434,709) \nRevenue/Variable Cost  169.0%  78.0%  161.1%  135.8% \nO&M  = operation and maintenance, PV = present value, Rf = Maldivian rufiyaa.     \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \nNotes: Capital cost includes replacement of all mechanical and electrical equipment after ten years. Figures in bold \nindicate switching values\u2014the value at which the EIRR equals the opportunity cost of capital (12%). \n \n13.  The estimated average EIRR for this component is 9%. EIRRs are sensitive to changes in \ncharges and collection, in the analyses above the sensitivity indexes for changes in rates and \nchanges in the collection percentage are each around 3. The analysis for Naifaru suggests that this \nlevel of charge and collection may not be necessary for viable operation as the Naifaru center, \nproducing and EIRR of 29% at these rates, which well beyond the needs of cost recovery. Neither \nof the other two sites, as proposed, is comparable. Fonadhoo\u2212Gan development includes transfer \nstations serving some 920 households on two islands but can be extended to serve more of the \n2,200 households on Laamu Atoll. Similarly, the present designs for the other centers are not \nintended to be final as the center's are ultimately intended to serve the atolls rather than a small \nnumber of islands.  This will be addressed and finalized in the development of atoll level solid \nwaste management strategies  under the project.  Under such circumstances, the Mahibadhoo \nwaste management center would appear to be economically viable (EIRR = 12%) by doubling the ", "  Appendix 14  59 \nnumber of households served in the Alif Dhaal Atoll.  \n \n4.  Overall Environmental Infrastructure Component \n \n14.  The  environmental  infrastructure  component  includes  subcomponents  with  differing \ndegrees of economic viability and an overall EIRR for the component of 18.7%. Two of the three \nsubcomponents are below the 12% opportunity cost of capital, but further development of the solid \nwaste subcomponent, facilitated by the Project, is likely to raise that activity above 12%.10 Neither \nthe planning and environmental management component nor the management and implementation \ncapacity-building component have directly quantifiable benefits. Their benefits are in the form of \nthe increased effectiveness of planning and implementation of Government programs, as well as \nincreased institutional capacity. The rainwater tanks subcomponent is the most viable and the least \nsensitive to adverse changes. The solid waste subcomponent is sensitive, with an sensitivity index \nof 6, but this indicates the potential for further development of the Mahibadhoo and Fonadhoo\u2212Gan \ncenters, as envisaged in the context of development of atoll strategies, to make these activities as \ncomparably viable as Naifaru's solid waste program. \n \nTable A14.4: Summary of EIRR and Sensitivity Indexes \n \nCombined \nBase Case  Costs + 10%  Benefits - 10% \n Item  Changes \nEIRR  EIRR  SI  EIRR  SI  EIRR \n   (%)  (%)    (%)    (%) \nWater Supply  35.0  31.3  1.1  31.0  1.2  27.6 \nSolid Waste Management  9.0  3.6  6.0  3.0  6.7  -3.9 \nSanitation and Sewerage  3.5  2.0  1.9  1.1  2.1  0.6 \nEnvironmental Infrastructure  18.7  16.4  1.6  16.0  1.8  13.8 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, SI = sensitivity index.         \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nD.   Financial Sustainability  \n \n15.  Though full cost recovery has not been set as a specific target, it is intended that O&M \ncosts be funded by users either through user charges or through communal O&M of facilities. The \nsurveyed willingness to pay for the sewage treatment subcomponent indicates that charges could \nraise amounts of $35,000 to $40,000 per year to cover the estimated annual community based \nO&M costs of $30,000 at Mahibadhoo and $40,000 at Fonadhoo. The rainwater tanks will be the \nresponsibility of each individual borrower from the revolving fund and it is expected that the high \nvalue of the water storage will ensure that the tanks are well maintained. Training will also be \nprovided under the Project. The present values in Table A14.3 indicate that the projected revenues \nfor solid waste management at Naifaru and Fonadhoo\u2212Gan will exceed the O&M costs\u2014including \nreplacement of all equipment after 10 years\u2014by over 60%. The atoll strategies to be developed \nunder the Project will ensure that, as well as engineering and environmental concerns, financial \nissues are addressed. The three project activities requiring on-going O&M appear to be financially \nsustainable without project or Government funding. Detailed methodology for tariff structure and \ntariff collection and administration will be developed under the Project for the sanitation and solid \nwaste management components. \n \n16.  Proposed monthly charges to households of Rf50 for solid waste management charges \nrepresent approximately 1% income for both Mahibadoo and Fonadhoo\u2212Gan, as are the proposed \n                                                 \n10 This likelihood is supported by the existence of more households to serve; capacity of centers to process their waste; \nresulting increase in income from recycling and potential income from charges; and high sensitivity of the EIRR to \nchanges in benefits and income. \n ", "60  Appendix 14 \nrepayment cost of the rainwater tanks, also estimated at Rf50. However, similar expenditure for \nNaifaru, where incomes are lower than average, represents a larger expenditure percentage. \nBased on Rf 125 user charge for sanitation and sewage treatment in Mahibadoo and Fonadhoo, \naverage  expenditures  of  approximately  2.5%  have  been  computed.  The  affordability  analysis \nindicates that the charge levels are affordable to domestic users in the latter islands, based on the \ngenerally accepted principles that the sum of the charges for water, sanitation, and sewerage and \nsolid waste services should not exceed 6%. It is recommended that proposed charges of Rf125 for \nsewage treatment be reviewed under the Project. \n \nTable A14.5: Affordability Analysis \n \nItem  Mahibadhoo  Fonadhoo   Naifaru \nAverage household monthly income (Rf)  4,620  5,040  2,310 \nAverage Expenditure: Water Supply (%)  1.1  1  2.2 \nAverage Expenditure: Solid Waste Management(%)  1.1  1  2.2 \nAverage Expenditure: Sanitation & Sewage Treatment (%)  2.7  2.5  \u2014 \n\u2014 = not available.           \nSource: Capacity Building for Regional Development Project, Phase II PPTA Survey. \n \nE.  Unquantified Benefits \n \n17.  Environment and Water Resources. Rainwater tank storage will provide additional safe \ndrinking  water  and  protect  the  water  lens  by  reducing  water  extraction  and  sources  for \nreplenishment. Sanitation, sewage treatment, and integrated solid waste management will prevent \ndegradation of groundwater resources and the marine environment. \n \n18.  Health. The health benefits of the Project, arising from a reduction in costs11, will be \nsignificant. In addition to waterborne diseases, considered in the benefit analysis, integrated solid \nwaste management will reduce burning of waste, and pest incidence, leading to reduced incidence \nof respiratory and insect and rodent-related diseases.  \n \n19.  Institutional Development, Organizational Benefits. The implementation of the Project \nwill help improve the capacity of central and regional agencies, and provide a solid foundation for \nmobilization and organization of communities to undertake O&M functions.  \n \n20.  Employment. The direct increase in jobs through the creation of cooperatives has been \nmentioned.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  provide  environmental  improvements  and  enhanced \ncapacity for environmental management, necessary for preserving the marine environment of the \nMaldives. It is expected that such improvements will lead to employment through increased tourism \ndevelopment and sustain and promote fishing activities for income and food security.  \n \n21.  Gender. There are almost twice as many men as women in the Maldivian work force. The \nProject endeavors to enhance women\u2019s involvement, train women and increase their contribution \nin income generating activities. The Project will provide opportunities for women to take a leading \nrole  in  O&M  of  utilities  and  increased  agricultural  production  resulting  from  increased  water \navailability. \n                                                 \n11  In 2001, health expenditure was estimated at $263 per capita, or 6.7% of (GDP).
