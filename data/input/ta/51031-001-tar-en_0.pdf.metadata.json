INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will increase rural clean energy \nsupply  in  the  greater  Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei  (BTH)  region  by  assessing  the  current  energy \nconsumption and structure, and their impacts on air quality.1 \n \n2.  The TA is included in the country operations business plan for the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC), 2017\u20132019.2 The TA is fully aligned with the country partnership strategy, 2016\u2013\n2020 for the PRC that features the management of climate change and the environment to support \nthe government\u2019s priorities in realizing an \u201cecological civilization.\u201d3 The TA will also support the \nstrategic priorities of the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto mitigate climate change and promote environmental sustainability.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  In recent years, haze has become a severe problem in the PRC, especially in the greater \nBTH region. In 2015, only 186 days met PRC\u2019s air quality standards in Beijing, while there were \n46 heavily polluted days. The frequent occurrence of haze in this region has drawn extensive \nattention domestically and internationally. Haze poses a threat to public health as well as \nsocioeconomic development. One study estimated that the severe haze in January 2013 may \nhave resulted in approximately 700 premature deaths, 6,000 hospitalizations for cardiovascular \ndisease, 5,500 hospitalizations for respiratory disease, and $250 million in economic losses.5 \n \n4.   Particulate matter that is less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter formed from the burning \nof raw coal is a main cause of large-scale haze in the greater BTH region. As living standards \nhave improved in the rural areas, households have transitioned from direct burning of traditional, \nlow quality fuels (e.g., straw, fuelwood, and other biomass) to raw coal in household stoves and \nheating facilities. Currently, coal accounts for more than 55% of domestic energy consumption in \nthe greater BTH region and its surrounding rural areas. This shift has resulted in adverse impacts \non the environment and high levels of pollution emissions. Raw coal combustion, especially low-\nquality coal combustion, produces a large amount of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.6 \nWhen emissions produced from coal-based power generation are compared to those produced \nby burning raw coal, results show that pollutant emissions from raw coal combustion are higher \nby about 5 to 10 times. This is largely because the pollutants are directly emitted into the \natmosphere without any treatment, 7 which poses serious risks to the environment and public \n                                                \n1  The greater BTH region refers to Beijing and Tianjin municipalities; Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, and Liaoning \nprovinces; and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. \n2  ADB. 2017.

The  Government  of  the  PRC  is  committed  to  increasing  the  use  of  clean  heating \ntechnologies. In May 2017, a joint notice was issued by the Ministry of Finance; Ministry of \nHousing, Urban, and Rural Development; Ministry of Environmental Protection; and National \nEnergy Administration to initiate clean heating pilots in the northern region.9 As part of this plan, \nthe central government will provide financial support to pilot cities to replace raw coal-based \nheating facilities with clean heating. The national government is also encouraging provincial and \nmunicipal governments to adopt policy measures that promote institutional innovation and attract \nprivate  sector  investments  to  scale  up  the  replacement  of  coal-based  heating  facilities  in \nadditional cities. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n6.  The TA will focus on the Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan municipalities and \nprovinces that have substantial biomass, solar, wind, and geothermal resource potential. In line \nwith the central government\u2019s plans, the TA will help local governments in the greater BTH region \ndevelop  policy  measures  to  optimize  rural  energy  supply  and  improve  air  quality  through \nknowledge-building activities. The activities include the following:   \n(i)  Conducting a survey to identify the status and structure of rural energy \nconsumption. Solving rural energy and environmental pollution problems requires \na well-designed energy structure that enables efficient use of energy. To obtain \ndata on rural energy consumption, a questionnaire and field survey in the greater \nBTH region will be conducted by the expert team. The survey results will be used \nto analyze current rural energy consumption patterns and structure, propose key \nmeasures for energy efficiency and pollution reduction, determine a reasonable \nenergy demand and supply system, and establish a rural energy consumption \nbaseline. \n(ii)  Assessing  impacts  of  rural  energy  consumption  on  air  quality.  Energy \nconsumption is one of the main causes of the deteriorating air quality in the greater \nBTH region. A study consisting of case studies, a literature review, and expert \nconsultations will be conducted by the expert team to assess the amount of \npollution  emissions  from  rural  and  semi-urban  energy  consumption  and  the \nresulting impacts on air quality of these emissions. \n(iii)  Proposing clean energy supply structures in pilot cities. The TA will analyze \ndifferent  technologies  to  supply  energy  in  cities  in  the  greater  BTH  region. \nConsidering the natural endowments of each municipality and province, the TA will \nfocus on improving energy efficiency and promoting biomass, geothermal, solar, \nand other clean energy technologies. The TA will (i) identify pilot cities based on \nthe location\u2019s energy consumption structure, local resource endowment, economic \ndevelopment levels, and inhabitants\u2019 lifestyles; and (ii) deploy the most appropriate \nalternative clean energy technologies. The selected clean energy sources must be \nreliable and reduce air pollution.10 Successful pilots should encourage neighboring \nareas to switch from coal-based sources to clean energy. \n                                                \n8  About 700\u2013800 million tons of raw coal are used annually in the PRC. \n9  Northern region refers to the northern part of PRC where heating is compulsory, it includes Beijing, Tianjin, Henan, \nHebei, Shandong, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia.   \n10 For example, the combination of solar photovoltaic and air-source heat pumps would make full use of the available \nenergy resources, save energy and reduce emissions, and provide continuous heating supply. \n ", "3 \n(iv)  Assessing the market potential for clean energy and developing a clean \nenergy strategy. The TA will (i) conduct a field survey to assess the market \npotential for clean energy development and undertake a cost\u2013benefit analysis of \ndifferent clean energy sources, (ii) propose a clean energy development strategy \nand policy recommendations to the government, and (iii) include a workshop on \nclean energy supply in the greater BTH region. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: air pollution reduced and public health \nimproved in the greater BTH region. The TA will have the following outcome: rural energy structure \nand air quality improved in the greater BTH region. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n \n8.  Output 1: Survey of the status and structure of rural energy consumption in the \ngreater Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei region conducted. By 2019, the major factors affecting rural \nenergy consumption behaviors will be identified by the expert team and a report on the status and \nstructure of rural energy consumption in the greater BTH region prepared by the expert team. \n \n9.  Output 2: Report on the status and structure of rural energy consumption in the \ngreater BTH region prepared. By 2019, a report summarizing the impacts of rural energy \nconsumption on air quality will be prepared by the expert team.  \n \n10.  Output 3: Rural clean energy supply plan proposed. A rural energy supply plan will be \ndeveloped to identify the most appropriate technologies to supply energy in various pilot cities of \nthe greater BTH region. By 2019, at least three clean energy pilots will be conducted by the expert \nteam. \n \n11.  Output 4: Recommendations on the clean energy development strategy made to the \ngovernment. By 2019, the market potential for clean energy development in the pilot cities will \nbe assessed and a cost\u2013benefit analysis conducted to inform policy recommendations for a clean \nenergy development strategy by the expert team. A workshop on clean energy supply in the \ngreater BTH region will also be organized by the expert team for related stakeholders, including \ngovernment officials, financial institutions, and the private sector. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).
