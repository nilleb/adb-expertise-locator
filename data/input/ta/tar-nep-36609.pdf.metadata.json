In response to a request from the Government of Nepal to the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) for institutional reforms, including introduction of the \nprivate sector participation (PSP) modality with recruitment of a management contractor (MC),1 \na Fact-Finding Mission visited Nepal from 9 to 20 September 2002. The Mission was carried out \nin conjunction with a Joint Review Mission for the Melamchi Water Supply Project (MWSP).2 \nMeetings were held with concerned officials of the Ministry of Finance; the Ministry of Physical \nPlanning and Works (MPPW); the Melamchi Water Supply Development Board (MWSDB); and \nother multilateral and bilateral MWSP development partners, including  the Japan Bank for \nInternational  Cooperation  (JBIC)  and  the  Norwegian  Agency  for  International  Cooperation \n(NORAD) to discuss and agree on the goals, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA.3 The TA framework, which is \nsubsumed under the overall MWSP framework, is in Appendix 1. These institutional reforms and \nthe introduction of the PSP modality are integral parts of the MWSP and essential for improving \nthe  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  in  the Kathmandu  Valley.  The  TA  concept  was \nreviewed and approved by Management on 23 October 2002. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In the past, the absence of a clearly defined policy for urban water supply and sanitation \nservices handicapped sector progress in Nepal. The existing  urban water supply utility, the \nNepal Water Supply Corporation (NWSC), which was supported by a number of development \npartners for more than 30 years, has been able neither to deliver efficient and affordable \nservices on a sustainable basis, nor significantly to expand its service coverage for the residents \nof  the  Kathmandu  Valley.  Excessive  political  intervention,  weak  management,  and \npreoccupation with new investments have contributed to inadequate and inefficient operation \nand maintenance (O&M) and weak revenue collection. A number of studies, funded by the \nUnited Nations Development Programme,  the World Bank, and more recently ADB, were \ncarried out to understand the issues and formulate recommendations. As a result, there  is a \nclear consensus among the MWSP development partners and relevant government agencies \nthat  the  proposed  institutional  reforms,  in  particular  introduction  of  the  PSP  modality for \nmanaging and improving water distribution and sanitation services, are essential to the sector's \ndevelopment. \n \n3.  Among the issues that have caused the chronic drinking water shortage problem in the \nKathmandu  Valley,  the  shortage  of  sufficient  source  water  is  fundamental.  Thus,  the \nGovernment initiated the MWSP, which consists of  a river water diversion  scheme from the \nMelamchi Valley to the Kathmandu Valley, distribution network rehabilitation and improvements, \nconstruction  of  a  water  treatment  plant  and  bulk  distribution  system,  wastewater  system \nimprovement,  and  clearly  defined  policy  and  institutional  reforms.  Governance,  PSP, \nestablishment of a regulatory mechanism, cost recovery and sustainability, affordable service \ndelivery for the poor, and optimization of limited water resources are all issues to be addressed \nto ensure success of the MWSP. \n \n4.  The World Bank had earlier indicated an interest in financing the PSP scheme for \nmanaging and improving water  distribution. However,  the Private Sector Participation High-\nLevel Committee (PSPC), in charge of MC recruitment under the World Bank assistance, was \nunable  to  award  a  PSP  contract  because  very  few  firms  were  interested,  mainly  due  to \n                                                 \n1 It was referred to as a private operator (PO) earlier. \n2 ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Nepal \nfor the Melamchi Water Supply Project. Manila \n3 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 11 October 2002. ", "2 \nrestrictive prequalification (PQ) criteria. The type of PSP, which called for a management lease \ncontract with a significant amount of capital investment funding by the MC itself, also may have \ndampened private sector interest. Subsequently, the Government and the World Bank mutually \nagreed to reallocate the World Bank funds that were originally earmarked for this PSP scheme \nto other activities of national priority. The Government, in turn, requested ADB to assume the \nlead  role  for  the  PSP  scheme  and  associated  institutional  reforms,  and  to  identify  other \ninterested cofinancier(s), particularly from those already involved in the MWSP. \n \n5.  MC recruitment is an essential part of the MWSP; it is a key condition for the award of \ncivil works contracts (both the ADB-funded contract and the NORAD/Swedish International \nDevelopment Cooperation Agency-funded contract) for  diversion tunnel construction. As the \naward of these contracts is now expected in the first half of 2004,  MC recruitment is on the \ncritical path for the entire MWSP. Therefore, MC recruitment must be restarted as a matter of \nurgency to keep the current overall implementation schedule of the MWSP. \n \n6.  In view of the earlier unsuccessful PQ under the management lease contract model, the \nGovernment and ADB agreed to pursue a  shorter performance-based management contract \nmodel (i.e., for about 5 years initially, renewable for about an additional 5 years to cover MWSP \ncommissioning).  Under  this  PSP  model,  the  MC  would  be  reimbursed  through a fee for \nmanagement services and through incentive payments based on its performance measured by \na set of key performance indicators. This PSP model, which does not require the MC to provide \na  significant  amount  of  capital  investment  funding,  is  more  promising  than  the  earlier \nmanagement lease contract model in the current Nepali context, and possibly the only viable \nalternative for now. It should facilitate PSP by reducing risks for the Government as well as for \nthe MC, and ensure a more competitive bidding environment and, thus, a better price for the \nservices. \n \n7.  According  to  the  current  implementation  schedule  of  the  MWSP,  legislation  for \nestablishing  a  new  regulatory  body,  called  the  National  Water  Supply  Regulatory  Board \n(NWSRB), needs to be in place by early 2004.4 The establishment of an independent and \nautonomous agency for planning, implementing, and managing  the urban water supply and \nsanitation systems in  the Kathmandu Valley, called the Kathmandu Valley Water Authority \n(KVWA), is scheduled for 2005.5 Under the management contract model (para. 6), however, \nthere must be a counterpart utility entity for the MC to manage upon its recruitment. At the same \ntime, under the management contract model, regulatory arrangements under NWSRB do not \nneed to be as strictly defined as would have been under the management lease contract model. \nTherefore, some adjustments may be required  in the sequencing of these reform efforts.  It \nwould be best if the restructuring of NWSC and the establishment of KVWA could be completed \nbefore the recruitment of the MC. However, restructuring6 of this public utility will be complex \nand, therefore, unbundling of the Kathmandu Valley operations (without senior management) of \nNWSC from the rest of NWSC is now considered more appropriate to create this counterpart \nutility entity. \n \n8.  Many of the poor do not have access to  piped water supply  under current NWSC \noperations, and  NWSC  has  shown  insufficient  response  to  their  needs.  Issues  precluding \nefficient water supply service provision for the poor require further analysis and close integration \n                                                 \n4 Establishment of NWSRB is currently a condition for the award of an ADB-funded civil works contract for diversion \ntunnel construction. \n5 Establishment of KVWA is currently a condition for the award of civil works contracts for the bulk distribution system. \n6 The voluntary retirement scheme launched by NWSC management in 2002 received many positive responses from \nNWSC staff, but only 38 persons benefited from this scheme due to limited funding. This scheme should be \nallowed to continue, with more persons opting for early retirement, releasing current overstaffing pressure. ", "    3 \nwith  the  MWSP. Therefore, equitable  provision  of water supply  services for the poor and \nsufficient public involvement in the reform process are critical themes for this TA as well as for \nthe overall MWSP. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  The proposed TA is a project preparatory technical assistance but will also assist the \nGovernment in overall sector reform, including enabling legislative actions and service delivery \nstrategy development. \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The  primary  task  of  the  TA  is  comprehensive  support  for  the  Government  in  the \npreparation of the PSP scheme and subsequent recruitment of the MC under a performance-\nbased  management  contract  for  the  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation  systems  in  the \nKathmandu Valley. Associated tasks include (i) establishment of NWSRB, (ii) restructuring of \nNWSC and subsequent establishment of KVWA, (iii) formulation of a pro-poor and gender-\nsensitive water supply service delivery strategy and its incorporation in the MC contract and the \nGovernment's investment programs, and (iv) preparation of a loan project7 to finance the MC \ncontract and NWSC restructuring for consideration for ADB funding. In addition, the TA will \nprovide some assistance in legislation for groundwater usage licensing and charging, and will \nfacilitate  levying  arrangements  for  the  interbasin  water  transfer  from  the  relatively  poorer \nMelamchi Valley to the relatively richer Kathmandu Valley, both of which are already proceeding \nunder the MWSP. \n \n11.  NWSC's  current  operations  units  for  the  Kathmandu  Valley  are  expected  to  be \ntransformed  into  an  embryonic  KVWA  with  necessary  transitioning  arrangements  for  the \nrelevant NWSC employees. The Government requires assistance for reviewing and analyzing \nNWSC\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, involving its unions, and for making recommendations for \nits institutional reform, including possible downsizing. Regarding the establishment of NWSRB, \nas PSP is relatively new in Nepal, the Government requires start-up assistance for smoothly \noperationalizing its proper regulatory functions to protect the public interest. A number of \nassociated training, workshops, and consultation activities will also be carried out under the TA. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The expected outputs to effect sector reforms will be delivered first by thoroughly \nreviewing  a  number  of  prior  studies,  draft  legislation,  and  institutional  reform  proposals\u2014 \nparticularly those carried out under the earlier World Bank assistance\u2014and integrating them \ninto a coherent strategic package. A broad range of stakeholders including beneficiaries, in \nparticular  those  in  poor  neighborhoods  and  women;  relevant  municipalities;  concerned \nnongovernment  organizations;  and  broader  civil  society  must  be  further  consulted.  The \nenvironmental category of the project is B. In accordance with ADB's Environment Policy and \nother applicable requirements, rules, and regulations of ADB and the Government, an initial \nenvironmental examination will be prepared for the physical works involved with the associated \ndistribution network rehabilitation and improvement in conjunction with the loan project, together \nwith matrices of potential environmental impacts of the policy actions to be included in the loan \nproject. \n \n13.  The PQ process for the MC recruitment is expected to have proceeded through advance \naction  up  to  the  PQ  application  submission  stage  by  TA  consultant  team  mobilization. \nTherefore, the team will be able to start the PQ evaluation immediately upon its mobilization. \n                                                 \n7 The loan is likely to be a sector development program with about two thirds of the loan amount to finance the \nmanagement contract and the remainder for NWSC restructuring and other related purposes. ", "4 \n14.  The shallow groundwater well field development project at the Manohara River, funded \nby the Japan International Cooperation Agency, will provide additional bulk water supply long \nbefore the commissioning of the MWSP. The Manohara project will provide 15 million liters per \nday (MLD) of bulk water during the dry season and 25 MLD during the wet season, which \ncreates a perfect opportunity to introduce a distribution network rehabilitation and improvement \nprogram supported by adequate bulk water supply. A demonstration scheme will, therefore, be \ndesigned as an integral part of the prospective MC contract under which the same MC will be \ngiven wider and more autonomous responsibilities within the demonstration scheme area. In \nessence, in exchange for providing higher level service, higher cost recovery will be achieved \nwithin the area.8 This demonstration scheme will not only show off the real potential of efficient \nprivate sector management to the general public but also provide an excellent opportunity for \nfine-tuning the program by incorporating customer feedback and  an ideal seedbed for staff \ntraining under the new operational modality. The program will then be repeated in a carefully \nplanned long-term sequence to cover more and more areas toward the ultimate goal of covering \nthe entire Kathmandu Valley service area. \n \n15.  Under the Local Self-Governance Act, municipalities are responsible for urban water \nsupply and sanitation. Most of the five municipalities of the Kathmandu Valley have already \nindicated that they intend to participate in KVWA and to be served by the MC under the PSP \nscheme. However, if there is a municipality that intends to carry out water distribution within its \nmunicipal boundary by itself, the MC will then play the role of its bulk water supplier, provided \nthat the municipality can prove itself capable of and ready for performing such a function. The \nbulk water tariff must be set at a lower level than the tariff for the average customer of the MC \nbecause no capital and O&M costs for distribution services are required for such a municipality. \nThis philosophy will also apply to small-scale service providers intending to serve a certain \nneighborhood with the consent of all its residents. \n \n16.  The main risks include (i) general political stability and security in the country regarding \nthe  insurgency,9 (ii) temporary  absence  of  elected  municipal  government  officials 10 and \nParliament,11 and  (iii) uncertainty  regarding  the  new  decentralized  urban  service  delivery \nmodality  under  the  Local  Self-Governance  Act  (para.  15).  However,  the  Government  has \nunequivocally given its utmost priority to the overall urban water supply sector reform as an \nessential component of the MWSP, and has continuously shown its commitment to the reform. \nFurthermore, there is broad-based support for the reform among civil society. Therefore, the \nproposed ADB intervention under this TA is justifiable and timely. \n \n17.  JBIC's Special Assistance for Project Implementation study on the distribution network \nstarted in November 2002, while another small JBIC study on poverty mapping began in \n                                                 \n8 Therefore, the tariff schedule for the demonstration scheme area will be different from the regular tariff schedule for \noutside the demonstration scheme area. The MC will be allowed to switch from the regular tariff schedule to this \nalternative tariff schedule for higher level service by declaring that a certain higher level service will be continuously \nprovided for all customers within the demonstration scheme area (or its subset) from a certain date. There will be \nprovisions (i.e., penalty imposed on the MC and compensation given to the customers) for failure to provide such \nservice. \n9 The insurgency, which started in 1996, has intensified since November 2001, when the insurgents broke off an \nagreed upon cease-fire and attacked the Royal Nepal Army. However, a new cease-fire agreement was reached \non 29 January 2003, and the security situation now appears to be improving. \n10 The terms of local elected bodies expired in July 2002, but owing to security conditions, elections could not be held. \nDespite a provision in the Local Self-Governance Act to extend the terms of the incumbent elected officials up to a \nyear, the Government decided not to extend their terms, and instead reconstituted local-level committees with civil \nservants as an interim arrangement. \n11 The Government, prompted by a difference of views over the proposed extension of the state of emergency, \ndissolved the Lower House of Parliament in May 2002 and called for midterm elections, which, owing to security \nconditions, could not be held. ", "    5 \nOctober 2002. These two JBIC studies and this TA will complement one another. ADB and JBIC \nwill coordinate closely in this regard. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.75 million equivalent, including a foreign \nexchange cost of $1.09 million and a local currency cost of $0.66 million equivalent. ADB will \nfinance the entire $1.09 million foreign exchange cost and $0.31 million equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Norway, in the \namount of NKr5 million (about $0.70 million equivalent), and the Japan Special Fund, funded by \nthe Government of Japan, in the amount of $0.70 million. The Government of Nepal will finance \nthe remaining local currency cost of $0.35 million equivalent by providing counterpart staff, \noffice  accommodation,  and  other  miscellaneous  expenditures.  The  Government  has  been \nadvised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  MPPW will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and MWSDB the Implementing Agency \nin  charge  of  its  overall  management  and  coordination.  The  Kathmandu  Valley  Water \nManagement  Support  Committee  (KVWMSC),  which  reports  to  MPPW  through  MWSDB's \nBoard, has been newly established to take over the functions of PSPC in facilitating preparation \nand implementation of all the relevant institutional reforms with agencies concerned, and in \ncarrying out MC recruitment on behalf of  MPPW. This Committee  is headed by a full-time \nexecutive director. The executive director will be supported by several full-time deputy directors, \nseconded from MPPW and other relevant government offices. Specialist inputs required for the \ncommittee's mandates will be provided by consultants under the TA. Stakeholder consultation \nsessions will be held on a regular basis to discuss the TA's progress and obtain feedback. \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 12 months commencing about April 2003 \nand with an expected completion date of about April 2004. It will require approximately 40 \nperson-months of international and 60 person-months of domestic consulting services for the \nmain consultant team. In addition, services of individual consultants will be required at certain \nkey junctures to support KVWMSC. The services of three individual international consultants for \na total input of 6 person-months and two individual domestic consultants for a total input of \n4 person-months  are  anticipated.  For  the  main  consultant  team,  a  water  supply  expert \nexperienced  in  MC  recruitment  will  be  engaged  as  the  team  leader,  bearing  the  overall \nresponsibility for the whole scope of the assignment. The team will comprise international and \ndomestic consultants with various expertise including institutional, legal, regulatory, financial, \neconomic, engineering, procurement, public relations, environmental, social, and labor relations. \nThe outline terms of reference are attached as Appendix 4. All the consultants will report to the \nexecutive director of KVWMSC, seeking guidance on the day-to-day implementation of the TA, \nwhile they will seek critical guidance from the ADB team leader as and when needed. \n \n21.  The  individual  consultants  will  be  recruited  on  an  individual  basis,  while  the  main \nconsultant team will be recruited on a corporate basis following submission of full technical \nproposals in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. For the engagement \nof domestic consultants, other arrangements satisfactory to ADB may be used, too. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n22.  The President recommends that the Board approve (i) ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding NKr5 million ($0.70 million equivalent) to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Government of Norway, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the \nequivalent of $0.70 million on a grant basis, to the Government of Nepal for preparing the \nKathmandu Valley Water Management Support Project.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national  Yes  Sector identified as a national  Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?  priority in country poverty  \n  partnership agreement? \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Nepal: \nThe Melamchi Water Supply Project (MWSP) will provide a least-cost solution to mitigate the socioeconomic stress \ncaused by the inadequate supply of safe drinking water for Kathmandu Valley residents by optimizing water use in \nthe valley as well as developing new water sources outside the valley. This will benefit 180,000 households in the \nvalley by improving water supply services, in terms of quantity, quality, and timeliness of supply, as well as more \nequitable distribution. The impact ratio for the poor has been estimated to be four times that for the not-so-poor. The \nProject will also provide socioeconomic benefits to about 40,000 residents of the Melamchi Valley by increasing \nincomes from improved access and expanded markets, reduced workload for women, and better education for \nchildren. These benefits have not been quantified and, to that extent, the economic benefits are understated. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis    Proposed Classification: Human Development/Environment \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nPoverty in Nepal \n(i) The recent estimate indicates that 42% of Nepal\u2019s total population are living below the official poverty line, and \npoverty reduction is the primary objective of the Government\u2019s development policy, as indicated in the Government's \nTenth Development Plan (2002-2007). \n \nPoverty in the Kathmandu Valley \n(ii) Although no official estimates of the extent of poverty in the Kathmandu Valley are available, data derived from the \nNepal Living Standards Survey of 1995/96 indicate that, based on a poverty threshold of NRs9,000 per capita per \nannum, equivalent to about $122, the extent of the urban poor ranges from 10 to 13%. However, given that rents and \nother costs are higher in Kathmandu than in other urban areas of the country, 12-15% would be a conservative \nestimate of urban poverty in the Kathmandu Valley. Nevertheless, income poverty alone is insufficient to understand \nthe extent of poverty in the valley. \n \n(iii) Most of Kathmandu\u2019s poor live in very low quality houses, squatter settlements, or rental accommodation. Rental \naccommodation is occupied by a range of low-income groups, such as daily wage earners, hawkers, and partly \nskilled laborers. Squatters live mainly on marginal government-owned land; their population has grown considerably \nand is now estimated at 18,000. Overall, most poor live in small settlements in the midst of higher-income housing \nand, consequently, are not very visible. \n \n(iv) Access to reliable water supplies is a problem for most low-income communities. Reliance on public supplies from \nthe Nepal Water Supply Corporation (NWSC) is minimal; most urban poor depend on private or traditional sources of \nsupply. Shallow wells are a popular source, but these are usually contaminated and responsible for a variety of \nwaterborne diseases. About 67% of the population believe that the quality of water supplied by NWSC is poor; almost \n72% of households in the Kathmandu Valley treat their water before consumption. Boiling and filtering, the most \ncommon means of treatment, involve considerable expense and impact mainly on the poor. Based on a 1999 survey \nundertaken during MWSP project preparation, 36% of the households suffer from water-related diseases. Diarrhea, \nstomach ailments, and dysentery are the dominant health problems and impact significantly on productivity and \nincome because of working days lost and treatment expenses. Although no data are officially available, diarrhea is a \nleading cause for child mortality throughout Nepal, and in the Kathmandu Valley in particular. \n \n(v) The hardships in accessing water in the Kathmandu Valley are severe. With piped water supplies limited to 2 \nhours every alternate day, most consumers, and particularly the poor, rely on secondary sources. Although the time \nspent by the poor in accessing water for domestic use varies, approximately 1 hour is required. A number of domestic \nfunctions are undertaken at the water point to minimize the volume of water to be carried home. Women are the \npredominant carriers of water. Residents of low-income areas carry home only about 10 liters per person of water \nevery day. This is insufficient to maintain basic hygiene and sanitation standards, and is a prime cause of the high \nlevels of morbidity and mortality. \n \nPoverty in the Melamchi Valley \n(vi) The project area of the MWSP also covers the Melamchi Valley, which includes a large part of Sindhupalchok \nDistrict and a small part of Kabhre Palanchok District, both of which are predominantly rural despite their proximity to \nKathmandu. The poverty incidence in Sindhupalchok District is high at about 50-55%; 85% of the population live at a \nsubsistence level. Small landholding size (0.6 hectare on average), physical remoteness due to topography and lack ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nsubsistence level. Small landholding size (0.6 hectare on average), physical remoteness due to topography and lack \nof roads, low agricultural productivity, and poor access to health and education services perpetuate poverty in the \ndistrict. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis:  \n \nThe MWSP has been prepared with extensive participation of stakeholders, including beneficiaries, adversely \naffected people, village development committees and ward representatives, district development committees and \nmunicipality officials and representatives, ministries concerned and the Melamchi Water Supply Development Board \n(MWSDB), the private sector, external funding agencies, nongovernment organizations, and consultants. The Project \nwill address the direct participation of beneficiaries through (i) social uplift program implementation, (ii) representation \nof adversely affected people in the compensation determination committee, and (iii) representation of Kathmandu \nValley beneficiaries in a water users association. The Project will also undertake consensus building at all levels on \nissues such as water services, environmental and social impact mitigation and compensation, and employment. For \nadversely affected communities in the Melamchi Valley, local consultative groups will be established in each affected \nward and village development committee. Prior to 31 December 2001, a consultative committee was established \nrepresenting the inhabitants of the Melamchi Valley and includes representatives of MWSDB and the chairperson. \nMemoranda of understanding will be signed between this consultative committee and the Government. To ensure \nthat women's participation and gender concerns are fully addressed, a gender strategy will be developed and \nimplemented. Apart from this, it has been agreed that at least one of the members of the regulatory body will be \nfemale. \n \nParticipation strategy required: Yes \nTo support the introduction of privately operated water supplies, a public awareness/relations unit will be established \nin the MWSP Project Management Unit. This unit will ensure that stakeholders are kept informed about the MWSP \nand are given an opportunity to express their views. The public relations program will be a proactive campaign that \nwill identify any potential conflict area at an early stage, assist in consensus building between the Project and the \nlocal communities, and manage public expectations on compensation and the social uplift program. \nD.
