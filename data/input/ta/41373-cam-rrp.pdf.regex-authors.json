Cambodia\u2019s growth has been unevenly concentrated in urban \nareas; a key thrust of the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) \n2006\u20132010 is to reduce rural poverty, particularly through policy and \nfinancial support to the agriculture sector. Agriculture employs 70% of \nthe rural population and accounts for about one-third of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP). Yet the public financial management (PFM) system \nthat  manages  and  delivers  the  resources  for  rural  development  is \nconstrained in a number of areas. Most critically, government capacity \nis  limited  in  the  area  of  PFM,  where  a  scarcity  of  qualified  and \ncompetent finance specialists and line managers severely affect the \nquality and effectiveness of the budget process. \n \nThe  Public  Financial  Management  Reform  Program  (PFMRP)  was \nlaunched in December 2004 by the Ministry of Economy and Finance \n(MEF) to address weaknesses in the PFM system. PFMRP aims to \nestablish a strong PFM system to facilitate the implementation of the \nNSDP. It has been designed as a long-term rolling program, building \non a series of platforms. The four platforms specify a package of \nreform activities, including complementary institutional, capacity and \nincentive reforms that, when completed, will provide a comprehensive \nPFM system for Cambodia. Platform 1 has already been implemented. \nIts objective was to make the budget more credible as an instrument of \nstrategic  management  of  public  resources  and  to  hold  budget \nmanagers accountable for efficient use of these resources. \n \nOf particular concern for rural development, is the fact that the line \nministries which support rural development in Cambodia are currently \nsome of the weakest and most underfunded of all the ministries. The ", "ii   \nthree ministries are the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), Ministry \nof Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF), and Ministry of Water \nResources  and  Meteorology  (MOWRAM).  In  addition,  there  are \noverlaps of responsibilities in the three ministries. They suffer from \nweak interministerial and intraministerial coordination mechanisms and \nshortages of qualified staff. Critically, their budgets also tend to be \ngrossly  underfunded,  which  exacerbate  public  expenditure \ninefficiencies and contribute directly to low levels of service delivery in \nrural areas and to reduced economic opportunities for the rural poor. \nIncreasing the quality of PFM systems in these ministries is a priority \nfor the Government and also for the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nwhich  currently  provides  sizeable  investment  resources  to  these \nsectors. \n \nThe Program  The  program\u2019s  objective  is  to  assist  in  implementing  the  PFMRP, \nObjectives  particularly in the three aforementioned rural development ministries. \nTo  achieve  these  objectives,  the  program  will  support  government \nreforms  in  three  policy  areas  by:  (i)  strengthening  financial \nmanagement and increasing accountability, (ii) strengthening PFM in \nrural  development  ministries,  and  (iii)  improving  external  auditing. \nADB-financed PFMRDP will target (i) the capacity development needs \nof MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD in budget planning, preparation and \nexecution; procurement; and internal audit for better service delivery to \nrural  communities;  and  (ii)  the  capacity  development  needs  of  the \nNational  Audit  Authority  (NAA)  to  improve  the  overall  governance \nframework of the Cambodian public sector. \n \nFinancing Plan  It is proposed that the ADB provides a program grant of $6.71 million \nfrom  its  Special  Funds  resources  to  finance  subprogram  1  of  the \nPFMRDP, subject to such other terms and conditions substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Grant Agreement. \n \nPeriod and  The implementation period for subprogram 1 is from June 2006 to 31 \nTranching  December 2008, with a single tranche of $6.71 million to be disbursed \nunder subprogram 1 when the Government has met the conditions for \nthe grant to become effective. The closing date of the grant will be 90 \ndays from the date the Government has met the conditions for the \ngrant to become effective. Policy actions for subprogram 2 are subject \nto  revision  and  refinement  following  ADB\u2019s  assessment  of  the \nmacroeconomic  environment,  lessons  learned  from  implementing \nsubprogram 1, and the overall progress of PFM reforms. Subprogram \n2,  currently  estimated  at  $15.0  million,  will  be  presented  for \nconsideration and approval by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors based on the \nprogress achieved in implementing subprogram 1, including the status \nof compliance with the proposed policy actions, and the readiness of \nthe Government to undertake the succeeding policy reform measures. \nThe implementation period for subprogram 2 is within 24 months of \nsubprogram 1 grant effectiveness agreement. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The  Government  will  use  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds \ngenerated  by  the  grant  proceeds  to  primarily  meet  program \n ", "iii \nexpenditures and associated reform costs. \n   \nExecuting Agencies  MEF and NAA for the audit component. \n   \nImplementation  The coordination and program management structures established by \nArrangements  the Government for its public financial management reform program \n(PFMRP),  and  as  described  below,  shall  be  used  to  facilitate \nimplementation  of  the  Program.  The  Government\u2019s  Economic  and \nFinancial Policy Committee chaired by the deputy prime minister and \nMinister of the Ministry of Economy and Finance and comprising other \nkey ministers and secretaries of state of line ministries shall provide \noverall policy guidance. The  Government\u2019s steering committee on PFM \n(PSC), chaired by the secretary of state of the MEF and comprising the \nDeputy  Governor  of  the  National  Bank  of  Cambodia,  the  secretary \ngeneral of the Cambodia Rehabilitation and Development Board, and \nsenior representatives in charge of finance at the level of secretary \ngeneral or director general in charge of finance shall be the program \nsteering  committee  (PSC)  for  PFMRDP  responsible  for  coordinating \nprogram implementation and sustaining of subprogram 1 actions by \nrelevant ministries and agencies of the Government. The PFM working \ngroups established at each of the spending ministries, and chaired by \nthe  relevant  member  of  the  PSC  for  PFM  shall  support  Program \nimplementation at the ministry level. The PSC for PFM shall meet as \nrequired to: (a) review progress reports from the PFM working groups; \n(b) monitor progress and oversee the implementation of the Program; \nand (c) provide guidance and direction to relevant line agencies of the \nGovernment involved in Program actions and activities. The PSC for \nPFM  shall  ensure  that  the  reforms  are  undertaken  in  line  with  the \nagreed timetable and may invite ADB to participate in its meetings as an \nobserver  The  PSC  for  PFM  will  provide  the  link  between  two \nsubprograms. MEF shall be the Program Executing Agency and will be \nresponsible  for  the  overall  implementation  of  pillars  1  and  2  of \nsubprogram 1, including compliance with all policy actions, program \nadministration, disbursements, and maintenance of all program records, \nreporting to ADB. NAA will be the Executing Agency for the audit pillar \nof PFMRDP. \n \nProcurement and  The program grant proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign \nDisbursement  exchange  costs  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member \ncountries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other \nbilateral and multilateral sources. The grant proceeds will be disbursed \nto  the  Borrower  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements \nfor Program Loans. \n \nProgram Benefits  The PFMRDP will support Cambodia's efforts to reduce poverty by \nand Beneficiaries  introducing  prioritization  and  optimality  in  resource  allocation.  The \nProgram will: \n(i)  improve institutional arrangements and management practices to \nsupport  incentives  for  efficient  and  effective  delivery  of  public \nservices; \n ", "iv   \n(ii)  increase fiscal discipline by  allocating resources in accordance \nwith  strategic  priorities  and  ensure  reallocation  from  lesser  to \nhigher priorities; \n(iii)  ensure operational efficiency in public expenditure management \nthrough streamlined procurement and expenditure processes;  \n(iv)  improve  accountability  by  putting  more  focus  on  performance, \naccountability, audit oversight, and internal control; \n(v)  strengthen NAA as a pillar of national integrity; and \n(vi)  improve  PFM  systems,  which  are  critical  to  optimizing  donor \nassistance,  since  aid  is  increasingly  being  provided  through \nmodalities  that  depend  on  well-functioning  development, \nexecution, and control of budgets. \n \nRisks and  The  Program  is  firmly  embedded  in  NSDP  and  PFMRP,  the \nAssumptions  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda.  However,  the  following  risks  and \nmitigation measures have been identified.  \n \n(i)  Political risks is a risk to the sustainability of PFMRDP. There is \nstrong ownership in MEF, but the existing incentives for some line \nministries may not be sufficient to garner wide-ranging institutional \nsupport  for  Government-wide  implementation  of  the  reform \nprograms and to ensure expected outcomes across all levels of \nGovernment. However, given the strong commitment to reforms at \nthe highest level of political leadership and the broad consensus \non  the  nature  of  those  reforms,  there  is  little  risk  that  the \nmomentum for reform will wane. \n(ii)  Implementation may be undermined by excessive centralization in \ndecision making without adequate financial resources. Mitigating \nthis risk will involve taking measures to strengthen technical and \nadministrative capacity within the ongoing reform program and \nthrough  sector  investments.  Performance  monitoring  and \nenhancing Implementing Agency ownership of the program and \nidentifying reform champions will also be used to mitigate risk. \n(iii)  The current global economic slowdown  may cause the current \naccount balance to widen and disrupt macroeconomic stability, as \nCambodia depends heavily on exports. Weaker growth may in \nturn  worsen  the  institutional  environment,  thereby  limiting  the \nopportunity  for  reform.  However,  in  the  near  term,  continued \nemphasis on increasing tax revenue collections can improve the \nfiscal  position,  including  limiting  supply-side  effects  of  reduced \ngrowth prospects on institutional incentives for PFM reforms. \n \nGrant Assistance   A  project  to  support  institutional  and  capacity  development  is \n  estimated to cost $4.54 million equivalent. ADB will finance $4.1 million \n  on a grant basis from its Special Funds resources and the Government \n  will  finance  $445,000  equivalent  by  providing  counterpart  staff, \n  accommodation,  and  other  facilities.  All  taxes  and  duties  will  be \n  financed by ADB.  \n   \n  The  project  will  be  the  key  instrument  supporting  roll-out  of  PFM \n  reforms in rural-development ministries. Four project components will \n ", "v \n  support PFM reforms in the medium-term. One component will support \n  rural  development  ministries  (MAFF,  MRD,  and  MOWRAM)  to \n  implement and monitor key PFM reforms, with a focus on enhancing \n  budget  planning,  budget  execution  (including  procurement), \n  accounting,  recording,  and  reporting.  Another  component  will \n  strengthen internal audit mechanisms in these ministries, which will \n  increase management efficiency and improve financial controls and \n  procedures.  Strengthening  public  debt  management  in  the \n  Government will be another critical area of support (following on from \n  progress achieved from a recently concluded ADB TA project on debt \n  management). In addition, the project will support NAA to improve its \n  audit capacity and operational efficiency, as NAA has a fundamental \n  role  in  improving  the  quality  of  financial  governance,  reinforcing \n  institutional  oversight,  and  providing  checks  and  balances  in  the \n  management of public finances. Implementation of PFM reforms under \n  subprogram 2 will also require technical inputs and targeted on-the-job \n  support to equip the key Government agencies with the knowledge \n  and  skills  to  ensure  that  the  reforms  will  be  sustained  beyond \n  PFMRDP and that reform triggers under subprogram 2 are achieved. \n   \nCost Estimates  The Project is estimated to cost $4.54 million including estimated taxes \n  and duties of $25,000.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on: (i) a proposed \nprogram cluster to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Public Financial Management for Rural \nDevelopment  Program  (PFMRDP)  comprising  two  subprograms;  (ii)  a  proposed  grant  for \nsubprogram  1  of  the  PFMRDP;  and  (iii)  a  proposed  grant  for  institutional  and  capacity \ndevelopment. The PFMRDP was prepared by a joint team of representatives of the Government \nof Cambodia (the Government) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The program design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT \n \nThe Macroeconomic Context \n \n2.  Sustained High Economic Growth. Cambodia is at a crossroads as it transits from the \nlegacy of its conflict-ridden past and attempts to build institutions of democratic governance. \nStrengthening institutions in a range of areas and economic policies is important not only for \nreducing the risk of future conflict, but also for attracting foreign investments to support broad-\nbased economic recovery. Cambodia has recorded double-digit economic growth over the last 4 \nyears, averaging 11% annually (Table 1 overleaf). This growth has been driven primarily by \nindustry (garments and construction in particular). Economic growth reached 10.2% in 2007, \nwith the services sector growing faster than the industrial sector. Up to mid-2007, economic \ngrowth occurred in an environment of modest inflation, with rates fluctuating between 4% and \n6% between 2005 and 2007. Exports\u2014mainly garments\u2014grew by 11% in 2007 while imports \nexpanded by 14%, reflecting increased demand for investment goods. Overall, the trade deficit \nwas 15.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007 and 15.4% for the first 7 months of 2008. \nWith tourism reaching new heights, the current account deficit was 8.1% of GDP for the first 7 \nmonths of 2008 and rapid capital inflows took the balance of payments to a surplus of 4% of \nGDP in 2007. \n \n3.  Fiscal Policy Has Generally Been Prudent. Given its importance to macroeconomic \nmanagement, fiscal policy has been the key to the pro-growth investment environment in \nCambodia. The 2007 budget results did not vary substantially from past budgets, as revenue \ncollections were above target and expenditures were contained close to target levels. The \nbudget\u2019s primary balance showed a healthy surplus, while the overall deficit, incorporating \ninvestment outlays, amounted to a deficit of only about 0.4% of GDP for the first 7 months of \n2008, continuing the trend over the last few years. However, the Government budget continued \nto be contractionary, while Government deposits in the banking system have continued to \nincrease. While the macroeconomic variables of economic growth and balance of payments \nwere still clearly robust in 2007, there is cause for concern in 2008 and beyond unless inflation \nis brought under control. \n \n4.  Challenges  to  Sustaining  Economic  growth  in  2008  and  2009.  Recent    global \neconomic  problems  have  negatively  affected  demand  for  Cambodian  exports.  The  sharp \nslowdown in the US economy, for example, is affecting US demand for garment exports from \nCambodia, which fell by 1% in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the same period of 2007. \nThe unexpected recent surge in international food and energy prices has translated to double-\ndigit rates of inflation in 2008; this in turn is slowing household consumption and economic \ngrowth. Recent increases in oil prices may cut the economic growth rate by as much as three \npercentage points in 2008 (to about 6.5%), as production costs in Cambodia tend to have high \nfuel components. ADB forecasts that Cambodia\u2019s economic growth may slow by as much as 3 ", "2   \npercentage points in 2008, mostly because of increased fuel costs. This forecast is consistent \nwith the Government\u2019s own forecasts, which put economic growth in the range of 6\u20138% in 2008. \nHigh inflation will have a negative impact on poverty incidence in urban centers, and if it \npersists may also affect Cambodia\u2019s Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of a poverty \nrate of 28% by 2010.  \n \nTable 1: Country Economic Indicators, 2004\u20132008 \n \n  Fiscal Year \nItem  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008 \nA.

Government Strategy for Growth. In 2004, the Government announced its long-term \ndevelopment  strategy\u2014the  Rectangular  Strategy\u2014that  sets  out  the  country\u2019s  development \npriorities and policy agenda as a series of four interlocking rectangles with governance at its \ncore. The overarching priority of the strategy is better governance and institution building, \nincluding  fighting  corruption  and  public  administrative  reforms.  The  Rectangular  Strategy \nstresses governance as critical to economic growth through agriculture, infrastructure, private \nsector  growth,  employment,  and  human  resource  development.  In  2006,  the  Government \nannounced its second 5-year National Strategic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 (NSDP) which \naimed to streamline, prioritize and operationalize the Rectangular Strategy, and to help achieve \nthe Cambodian Millennium Development Goal interim targets (2010) through implementation of \nidentified programs and projects for development. The Public Financial Management Reform \nProgram (PFMRP) was also launched in 2004 by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) \nin response to weaknesses in the public financial management (PFM) system. Drawing on \nPublic Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) best-practice, the PFM reform program \nhas been designed as a long-term rolling program, building on a series of four interlinking \nplatforms that specify a package of reform activities, including complementary institutional, \ncapacity, and incentive reforms. When completed, the PFMRP will provide a comprehensive \nPFM system for Cambodia and serve as a basis for subsequent platforms.1 Figure 1 highlights \nthe links between Government and ADB strategies.  \n \n6.  The ADB country strategy and program 2005\u201320092 for Cambodia has highlighted good \ngovernance as critical to improving the responsiveness, cost effectiveness, efficiency, and \nquality of public service delivery, especially to the poor. The country operations business plan \nfor  Cambodia  for  2007\u20132009 3  further  seeks  to  strengthen  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  support  of \ngovernance activities, as it is widely recognized that significant strides in long-term poverty \nreduction is only possible with far-reaching fundamental reforms in PFM. Within this context, \nthe country strategy and program is focusing on PFM as a primary area of concentration, \nbuilding upon past and ongoing ADB activities. This policy emphasis is consistent with ADB\u2019s \nSecond  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan,  which  has  PFM,  procurement,  and \nanticorruption as central themes for improving governance. Figure 1 show linkages between \nthe Government\u2019s reform programs and PFM for rural development. \n \n7.  Partnership with Development Partners. To maximize harmonization and minimize \ntransaction costs, development partners are using a sector-wide approach to support PFM. The \nconsensus  among  development  partners  is  that  the  PFM  reform  program  should \nemphasize: (i) aligning the PFM work with the country\u2019s capacity and priorities and ensuring \nstrong  country  ownership  of  PFM  reforms,  (ii)  appropriate  prioritization  and  sequencing  of \nreforms within a multiyear time horizon, (iii) close coordination among development partners in \nsupporting PFM reforms, and (iv) using the internationally agreed PEFA PFM indicators for an \nintegrated and harmonized approach to measuring and monitoring performance and progress. \nThe  PFMRDP  is  consistent  with  PFMRP,  reflecting  the  shared  understanding  of  the \ndevelopment partners of the PFM problems in Cambodia.4 The PFMRDP is built around a \n                                                 \n1 The PEFA Program, comprising eight multilateral organizations as partners, aims to strengthen recipient and donor \nability to assess the status of country public expenditure, procurement, and financial accountability systems.

THE SECTOR DESCRIPTION AND PERFORMANCE \n \nSector Performance \n \n8.  Poverty in Cambodia is Primarily a Rural Phenomenon. Economic growth has been \nthe main driver of social and economic development in Cambodia. The national poverty rate \n ", "    5 \ndeclined from 47% in 1994 to 34% in 2004. While the benefits of growth have been widely \nspread  across  Cambodia,  the  rural  poverty  rate  has  not  declined  as  expected,  and  was \nestimated at 39% in 2004. With 80% of the population residing outside the main urban centers, \nthis translates to more than 4 million persons living below the poverty line in rural areas. Rural \npoverty in Cambodia has other dimensions besides low incomes. The poor have limited access \nto basic goods and services such as clean water, education, and health services. These are \nproblems that Cambodia needs to overcome to achieve several of its key MDGs (Table 1). \nCambodia\u2019s MDG target for poverty is 24% of the population by 2015. To achieve this target \nwill require average economic growth of 7.5% per annum from 2008 to 2015, inflation in the \nrange of 3%, and no change in the distribution of income between urban and rural families. If \ninequality  between  rural  and  urban  areas  increases,  higher  growth  may  be  necessary  to \nachieve  this  target.5 Thus,  increasing  the  efficiency  of  public  resources  targeted  for  rural \ndevelopment and increasing private sector-led economic opportunities in rural areas will be \ncrucially important to accomplishing Cambodia\u2019s MDG for poverty reduction. \n \n9.  Income  Inequality  (Figures  2  and  3).  Cambodia\u2019s  average  living  standards  as \nmeasured by consumption of goods and services per capita per day, increased by 32% in real \nterms between 1994 and 2004 (Figure 2). However, the increase in rural living standards was \nslower than in Phnom Penh and other major urban centers. Consequently, inequality measured \nby the Gini coefficient increased from 0.35 in 1994 to 0.4 in 2004. The increase in inequality \nhas primarily been caused by rapid urban growth, much of which occurred between 1994 and \n1997. Some widening of inequality is expected as a country develops, since growth tends to be \nurban-driven. Some of the gap also arose because of unequal access to public services and \nresources, but this  gap has narrowed since 1997. Various measures of school enrollment and \nmortality rates in rural areas have fallen over time. The disparity in access to infrastructure \n(roads), amenities (clean water and electricity), and basic services (schooling, healthcare) also \nnarrowed between 1997 and 2004, as did gender gaps in literacy and schooling.  \n \n10.  Budget Allocations to the Rural Sector. NSDP seeks to achieve economic growth and \nreduce  poverty  through  measures  that  promote  development  of  agriculture,  and  rapid \nimprovement  in  infrastructure  and  human  development.  NSDP  also  emphasizes  improved \ngovernance and public expenditure efficiency. All these measures if effectively delivered will \npositively  impact  rural  development,  reduce  rural  poverty,  and  reduce  income  inequality \nbetween rural and urban areas. Yet Cambodia\u2019s budget resources remain scarce and donor \ninvestment  funding  is  inadequate  in  most  areas.  Insufficient  resources  for  recurrent  and \ninvestment  expenditures  continue  to  adversely  affect  operational  planning,  resulting  in \nunderfunded implementation for development projects in the country. Cambodia\u2019s budget is \nseparated between the capital and recurrent budgets, reflecting that the Ministry of Planning \n(investment) and the MEF (current) prepare separate budgets. But the majority of investment \nactivities are financed by donors off-budget. The domestically financed and on-budget donor-\nfinanced investment budget is essentially a project budget with some recurrent expenditure \nlinked  to  project  financing.  The  fragmentation  between  recurrent  and  investment  budget \nallocation processes and high degree of off-budget donor flows has led to inefficient investment \nplanning and allocations. \n \n11.  While  there  are  major  difficulties  in  accurately  estimating  what  portion  of  public \nresources go to rural development or the rural population, it is estimated that about 4.4% of \nrecurrent  budget  allocations  are  provided  to  the  three  departments  involved  in  rural \n                                                 \n5  Oum, S. 2007.

This \nhas increased over time from 0.5% in the mid-1990s. MRD, MAFF, and MOWRAM currently use \nan incremental approach to planning and budgeting that limits their expenditures to new and \npredominantly investment projects financed by donors. The recurrent expenditure arising out of \nexisting and proposed activities (mostly donor financed), through require priority budgeting, is \nunderfunded, adversely impacting on service delivery to the poor. The focus of these ministries \nis on projects, which creates a vacuum for policy and budget strategizing.  \n \nTable 2: Progress on Millennium Development Goals \u2013 Regional Comparison \n \nGoal  1    2      3      4    5      6       \n \ne \n$1/day poverty  Underweight children  Primary Enrolment  Reaching grade 5  Primary completion rat Gender primary  Gender secondary  Gender tertiary  Under 5 mortality  Infant mortality  HIV prevalence  TB prevalence rate   TB death rate  Water urban  Water rural  Sanitation urban  Sanitation rural \nCambodia    \u2207  \u2022  \u0398  \u2022  \u0394  \u0398  \u0398  \u2207  \u2207  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022         \nIndonesia  \u2022  \u2207  \u2022  \u0398  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u0398  \u0394  \u0394  \u0394  \u2022  \u2022  \u2207  \u0398  \u0398  \u0398 \nLao PDR  \u2207  \u0398  \u0394  \u0398  \u0398  \u0394  \u0398  \u0394  \u0394  \u0394  \u0394  \u2022  \u2022         \nMalaysia  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u0398  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2207  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022   \nPhilippines  \u0398  \u0398  \u2207  \u2207  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u0394  \u0394  \u0394  \u2022  \u2022  \u2207  \u0398  \u0394  \u0398 \nThailand  \u2022    \u0394      \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u0394  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022 \nViet Nam    \u2022  \u2207  \u0394  \u2207  \u0398  \u2022  \u2207  \u2022  \u2022  \u2207  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u0394 \n\u2022 Early achiever, \u0394 On track, \u0398 Slow, \u2207 No progress/regressing. \nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nSource: Asian Development Bank/Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific/United Nations Development \nProgramme. 2007.

The Government has prioritized the education and health sectors for larger shares of the \nnational  Government  budget.  This  will  benefit  rural  schools  and  health  clinics.  The \nGovernment\u2019s broad policy on allocation of expenditures to achieve growth and development \nwas to increase and then stabilize social-sector spending at current levels relative to GDP. To \ndate the Government has prioritized social-sector spending over providing significant increases \nin expenditure on economic sectors (agriculture and infrastructure). From Figure 4 (overleaf) it \ncan be seen that expenditures on core Government activities decreased from 62% to 45% of \nthe executed state budget between 1995 and 2007. This may have resulted partially from \nincreased expenditures on health (from 4.6% to 10.51%) and on education (from 9.1% to \n14.81%)  over  the  same  period.  Expenditures  on  economic  services,  on  the  other  hand, \nincreased from 10.8% of executed expenditures in 1995 to 16.9% in 2001, before declining to \n7.3% in 2007. However, given that rural poverty persists, the Government is now looking to \nredress the balance between social- and economic-sector spending. Agriculture in particular will \nbenefit from an increased share of Government investment from 2009. \n \n ", "    7 \n13.  A key thrust of the NSDP 2006\u20132010 is to encourage growth in rural areas, in particular \nin the agriculture sector. Agriculture, which employs 70% of the rural population and accounts \nfor about one-third of GDP, remains vulnerable to external shocks and unfavorable weather \nconditions. Productivity in the agriculture sector is also low. The NSDP aims to reduce the \nvulnerability of the agriculture sector and increase agricultural productivity through land reforms \nand expansion of rural credit, among other measures. Improving rural infrastructure will also be \ncritical to reducing rural poverty and income inequality between rural and urban areas. Improved \nrural infrastructure will increase rural dwellers' access to services and markets for goods and \nservices. However, rural development ministries will require increased resources to implement \nthese reforms.  \n \n14.  The challenge for Cambodia will be to sustain economic growth in the range of 7\u20139% per \nannum, accelerate the creation of productive jobs, and reduce poverty. This will be no easy task \nwith half the population under 20 years of age and more than 85% of employment in the \ninformal sector (mainly subsistence agriculture), not to mention the relatively high rural poverty \nrate of around 39%. The Government recognizes that the key to sustaining high economic \ngrowth and reducing poverty is to diversify sources of economic growth from its current narrow \nbase in construction, garments, and tourism, which accounts for 42% of non-agriculture GDP. \nSustaining high economic growth over the long term will require economic diversification and \ncloser links between agriculture and service sectors. Promoting economic diversification will \nrequire further reforms at several levels of the economy, including: (i) reforms in agriculture, \ninvestment climate, and trade policy to improve competitiveness at all levels of the supply chain, \nfrom agriculture to the customs border transit points; (ii) increases in public capital spending, \nespecially in rural areas, in agriculture, and in the energy sector (rural electrification); and (iii) \npublic expenditure management reforms to align strategic objectives with budget outputs and \nthe medium-term expenditure framework; and to improve budget execution, reporting, efficiency \nand transparency. The Government\u2019s economic strategies, such as those articulated in its \nDiagnostic Trade Integrated Strategy, underline the critical importance of agriculture and rural \ndevelopment as the key to economic diversification.  \n \n15.  Donor-financed capital allocations for the rural sector are also expected to scale up \nresources in the near term, in line with the Government's priority to support the development of \nproductive sectors and further reduce rural poverty rates. Rolling out PFM reforms to rural \ndevelopment agencies will be crucial to ensuring that priority spending is carried out efficiently \nand transparently, and will ultimately lead to economic diversification and reduced poverty. Of \nparticular concern for rural development is the fact that the three line ministries\u2014MAFF, MRD, \nand MOWRAM\u2014are not sufficiently resourced. Low levels of funding and unskilled human \nresources further exacerbates public expenditure inefficiencies and contributes directly to low \nlevels of service delivery in rural areas, which subsequently reduces economic opportunities for \nthe rural poor.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "8   \n \nFigure 2: Comparison between Rural and \n  Figure 3: Inter and Intra Rural\u2013Urban \nUrban Living Standards \n   0.I0n8e4q uality \n     stant  8000 71096974 2004  ndex)            0         .IIR4nnueerqqauul\u2013aariiullnniiuttryybeer  awwaqqniiltt uu-hhu iaanrur llubriiattrayybl   aanwwnre iiaattrshh e ai nrsu  urarbl aanre aarseas\n                 an p.c. daily consumption, con 1993/4 riels) 234567000000000000000000 9511026 4833 18527303 27387270 43565701         n p.c. daily consumption (Theil I      000 ...000 123 ... 555123            00  .. 0010  ..38 10  5438  54   00..018345   000...11071495 000...011417 59  \n        ving std.

The three key ministries dealing with rural development have produced strategies and  \nadopted PFM planning tools to implement the NSDP. The MAFF has a strategic plan and the \nMRD has a budget strategic framework. However, one weakness is that the ministries tend to \noperate within \u201cpolicy silos\", and coordination of work in common areas is often weak despite \nrecent initiatives such as the joint strategic plan for water and agriculture. In the future it will be \nimportant for the three ministries to harmonize their rural development efforts and avoid policy \noverlap. \n \n  Figure 4: Distribut ion of Expenditure by Sector \n   \n  35  \n  30  \n   \n25\n  et  \n  dg 20  \nu\nB   \n  % of  15  \n  10  \n  5  \n   \n0\n   \n1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\n   \nYear\n   \nEconomic Services\n  Rural Development  \n  Social Services  \n   \nSource: Ministry of Economy and Finance and International Monetary Fund. \n \n \n \n ", "    9 \n17.  Successful  implementation  of  the  development  strategies  of  MAFF,  MRD,  and \nMOWRAM will also depend on the successful rollout of PFM reforms and capacity building. In \norder to meet the objectives for rural development outlined in the NSDP, these sectors will \nrequire (i) sustained funding from external sources, including budget support proposed under \nthis program;6 (ii) an increase in resource mobilization efforts of the Government; and (iii) \nconsideration by the Government of a feasible reallocation of expenditures into agriculture and \nrural infrastructure. The Government and development partners need to increase support for \nrural infrastructure, agricultural extension, and credit and marketing initiatives, as nearly three \nquarters  of  the  population  continue  to  depend  on  subsistence  agriculture.  The  proposed \nProgram, structured as a program cluster, aims to help the Government achieve its medium-\nterm goals of sustained economic growth in the range of 7\u20139% per annum, rural development, \nand poverty reduction through improved governance in public expenditure management at the \nthree  key  ministries  dealing  with  rural  development.  Reforms  leading  to  effective  budget \nexecution through timely release of funds to pro-poor sectors will improve expenditure targeting \nfor the rural population and increase value for money from spending of scarce resources. At the \nsame  time,  a  strengthened  PFM  system  enhances  accountability  of  service  providers  to \ntargeted beneficiaries by rationalizing expenditure policy, and improves financial accountability \nby reducing fiduciary risks to public funds. \n \nIV.  ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES \n18.  Notwithstanding the Government\u2019s commitment, implementation of the NSDP objectives \nto support rural development is constrained by (i) Cambodia\u2019s weak PFM system, (ii) capacity \nand resource constraints in the MEF, which hinder rollout of the full PFMRP to line ministries, \nincluding the rural development ministries, (iii) limited human resource capacity in line ministries \nto manage and deliver services, (iv) scarcity of resources available to implement policy priorities, \nand (iv) governance challenges that undermine the effectiveness of the budget as an instrument \nto affect rural poverty. The rollout of ongoing PFM reforms to the three rural development \nministries is, therefore, critical to NSDP objectives. In the three rural development ministries it \nwill be important to build commensurate capacity by rolling out the training program and other \nmeasures  designed  under  the  PFMRP  on  a  priority  basis.  As  such,  involvement  of  rural \ndevelopment ministries and a sense of ownership of the PFMRP by these ministries is a \nprerequisite for the realization of an effective system-wide PFM structure in Cambodia\u2014that is, \na  PFM  system  that  can  deliver  efficient  public  sector-funded  outcomes.  In  addition  to  the \nfollowing discussion, Appendix 5 analyses in detail the underlying issues. \n \n19.  PFM Policy Framework. A strong PFM system leads to aggregate control of budget \nresources, prioritization, accountability, and efficiency in the management of public resources \nand delivery of services, all of which are critical to the achievement of public policy objectives, \nincluding the MDGs. Effective PFM systems are also critical for ensuring the effectiveness of \ndonor financial assistance, since aid is increasingly provided through modalities that make use \nof  national  PFM  systems.  They  are  also  required  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  rural \ndevelopment and economic growth in the long term. Effective PFM systems moderate fiduciary \nrisks by increasing transparency and thereby reducing the scope for irregularities. However, \nbudget control effectiveness could still be limited by other factors, such as a weak legal and \nregulatory framework or human resource capacity constraints.  \n \n                                                 \n6 Cambodia currently receives around 10% of its external assistance in budget support which is fungible to support all \nsectors of the state budget, dependant on the policy priorities of the Government.  \n ", "10   \n20.  In an effort to establish an effective and efficient PFM system, the Government instituted \nthe multi-stage PFMRP to reform Cambodia\u2019s PFM system, in December 2004. With a 10-year \nplanning and implementation horizon, the PFMRP is being supported through a sector-wide \napproach with financing from a number of development partners, primarily through a multi-donor \ntrust fund.7 However, other donors, such as ADB, will be supporting the sector-wide approach \nthrough a proposed budget support grant to Cambodia to strengthen rural PFM systems. The \nfirst stage of the PFMRP, platform 1, was completed in 2007. Platform 1 was rolled out to \nimprove budget credibility and the day-to-day management of public resources by delivering \nreliable  and  predictable  resources  to  individual  managers.  Activities  undertaken  included \nimproving budget formulation and execution; improving sustainability of the budget; developing \na revenue strategy; improving the macroeconomic framework;  developing debt-management \ntools and streamlining the ability of budget entities to spend in line with their budget approvals; \nstreamlining the resource commitment and payment process, including outsourcing of MEF \nfinancial controllers to selected line ministries; reforming the procurement processes of line \nministries; increasing use of the banking system and reducing the use of cash for Government \ntransactions; commencing the consolidation of Government bank accounts into a treasury single \naccount; and eliminating arrears.  \n \n21.  For  the  second  stage  of  the  program,  the  Government,  with  assistance  from \ndevelopment partners, has prepared 'platform 2' for implementation between late 2008 and \n2011. The goal of platform 2 is to improve financial management accountability so that civil \nservants at all levels feel responsible for how they manage and control public finances. Building \ninternal audit capacity has been identified as a key objective of the PFMRP toward achieving \nthis goal. An effective internal audit function will ensure that (i) adequate control systems are \nestablished so that assets are safeguarded; (ii) financial reports are reliable; (iii) laws, policies, \nand  procedures  are  complied  with;  (iv)  resources  are  used  efficiently;  (v)  and  the  overall \nobjectives  of  the  spending  entity  are  achieved.  Internal  audit  units  face  the  challenge  of \nensuring that capacity is built so that they can deliver a professional service.  \n \n22.  The Government is fully aware that substantial improvements in public services will \nrequire more realistic budgets and better allocation of resources. First, Cambodia will have to \nimprove resource mobilization to ensure aggregate fiscal sustainability. Despite the need for \nhigher revenues to finance growth and poverty reduction, Cambodia\u2019s fiscal revenue ratios, \nespecially tax revenue, remain among the lowest in the world. Cambodia\u2019s total-revenue-to-\nGDP ratio stood at 11.3% in 2007. Without significant increases in revenues, there are risks to \nboth medium-term macroecomic sustainability and to implementation of the NSDP. To reduce \nthe risk of debt distress and finance higher levels of public spending, revenues will have to be \ngreatly increased. In addition, under PFMRP, issues concerning debt servicing and the cost of \ndebt servicing will be addressed within the context of the budget. The priority must be to \nminimize long-term financing costs while maintaining prudent risk levels. This will require a \n                                                 \n7  The sector-wide approach has established joint reform objectives, an agreed reform vision and strategy, agreed \npartnership principles and coordinated funding and support arrangements between development partners (DPS), \nwhich provides financial support for the implementation of PFMRP. Currently 13 development partners are \ncoordinating  their  assistance  and  the  program  is  cofinanced  by  a  multidonor  trust  fund  supported  by  four \ndevelopment partners (Australian Agency for International Development [AusAID], Department for International \nDevelopment, [DFID], European Union [EU], and Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency [SIDA], \nand a grant from the World Bank. Total funding is equivalent to approximately $32 million, of which the Government \nexecutes some $30 million for the 5 years 2005\u20132010. Some development partners also support PFMRP through \nadditional TA-based bilateral support.

Therefore, in the context of the fiscal and budget implications of debt sustainability \nissues, the Government considers implementing a modernized debt management office and \nsystem as integral to PFMRP reforms and ensuring sustainable priority spending over the long \nterm.8 Currently, the structure of Cambodia\u2019s public debt is not complicated when compared to \nother regional economies as most debt is concessional official development assistance (ODA), \nwith grace periods and longer maturity periods. There is virtually no domestic debt (including \ntreasury bills) and no external commercial borrowing. The debt-to-GDP ratio declined from 31% \nin 2006 to 29.4% in 2007 primarily because of economic growth. However, the Government \nanticipates that, over the longer term, a more complicated debt structure will evolve as the \neconomy develops and begins to raise finances from other sources beyond official development \nassistance (ODA) Going forward, strengthening capacity at the debt management office (DMO) \nwill  require  a  functioning  middle  office,  capacity  building  of  staff  in  producing  a  debt-\nmanagement strategy and starting regular debt reporting, and drafting decrees in the area of \npublic debt management to establish a clear set of rules, responsibilities, and obligations in \npublic debt management.  \nSupport to rural development ministries.   \n24.  PFM Reforms Priority: Support to Rural Development Ministries. Platform 1, of \nnecessity, placed heavy emphasis on building capacity first in MEF by internally restructuring \nthe ministry and introducing a merit-based pay initiative (MBPI) to provide incentives to civil \nservants to facilitate the reform process. For the second stage, PFMRP rollout to line ministries \nis a primary priority. Line ministries will receive support from core advisors in different areas of \nspecialization from MEF and from the training and skill development programs developed by the \nEconomic and Finance Institute (EFI). Much of this training will be funded through the multi-\ndonor trust fund. In association, ADB will design a project to support MAFF, MRD, and \nMOWRAM in implementation of the PFMRP to address current weaknesses in PFM, as these \nthree ministries supporting rural development remain constrained by PFM weaknesses. These \nweaknesses must be addressed urgently so that these ministries will be capable of more \nefficient management and of increasing service delivery in rural areas. Increasing the quality of \nPFM systems in these ministries is a policy priority for the Government, and also for ADB, which \ncurrently provides sizeable investment resources to the rural development sector that includes \nagriculture and natural resources sector.9 The key areas of weakness related to PFM in the \nthree line ministries targeted under the PFMRDP are as follows: \n \n(i)  There is a limited link between annual expenditure planning and medium-term \nplanning and financing in MAFF, MRD, and MOWRAM. Whereas the health and \neducation sectors have relatively strong budget planning frameworks, the rural \ndevelopment ministries are still in the early stages of developing links between \ntheir policies, programs, and the budget process. Moreover, weak coordination \nbetween the three ministries in the area of rural development policy has led to \nexamples  of  program  duplication  in  the  past,  a  weakness  that  could  be \n                                                 \n8  The Government requested that ADB anchor this component of PFMRP within the PFMRDP in view of ADB\u2019s past \ntechnical assistance that supported public debt management reforms and this will involve working with MEF. \n9  From the resumption of ADB operations in 1993 to the end of 2007, ADB had supported the agriculture and natural \nresources sector with a total approved amount of $125.5 million (five loans, one grant project, and 25 TAs). At the \nend of 2007, continuing loans and grants (three project loans, one program loan, and one project grant) for \nagriculture and natural resources aggregated $83.59 million or 15.9% of ADB\u2019s active portfolio in Cambodia. Also, \nin late 2007, there were nine active TA portfolios in the agriculture and natural resources sector for a total value of \n$7.05 million.  \n ", "12   \naddressed  if  planning  processes  were  better  coordinated  between  the  three \nministries. \n(ii)  Budget  planning  exercises  produce  unrealistic  budget  estimations,  which \nfrequently  do  not  have  identified  sources  of  funding,  and  ultimately  lead  to \nunderfunded service delivery outcomes. There is also a limited link between \nmedium-term planning, annual expenditure planning and financing needs and \nactual budget allocations in MAFF, MRD, and MOWRAM. \n(iii)  The agriculture, water, and rural development ministries currently rely on an \nincremental  approach  to  budget  preparation,  and  as  such  annual  budget \npreparation is largely based on the previous year\u2019s expenditure patterns rather \nthan on budgeted costs for planned sector activities, projects, and programs as \nestablished under sector planning exercises at the beginning of the budget cycle. \n(iv)  The  budget  execution  process  is  delinked  from  the  actual  budget  proposal \nprepared  by  rural  ministries  for  the  capital  budget.  However,  this  should  be \npartially  overcome  in  the  future  through  the  implementation  of  the  budget \nstrategic plan (BSP).10 Budget execution and accounting have been improved by \nthe  introduction  in  line  ministries  of  new  economic  and  administrative \nclassifications.11 The budget classification system is being extended further to \ninclude a standardized functional and program classification from 2009. \n(v)  Procurement  processes  lack  effective  control  mechanisms.  Although  some \nprogress in legislation has been made, changes on the ground have been limited. \nThere  is  an  inadequate  regulatory  framework  at  the  central  level  to monitor \nprocurement practices and this situation is mirrored in sector ministries. An ADB \nAssessment of MRD conducted in May\u2013June 2007 found that MRD\u2019s financial \nand  accountability  systems  needed  urgent  strengthening.  Significant \nprocurement  risks  for  donor-assisted  projects  were  also  identified.  The  ADB \n(Office of the Auditor General) findings on NRDP raised concerns across the \nboard (works, goods, services, running costs). 12 Over the years, lessons from \nongoing  projects  also  underlined  major  weaknesses  in  internal  control  and \nprocurement practices.13  \n(vi)  Internal audit departments in MOWRAM and MAFF were established in 2007 and \nin  MRD  in  2008.  However,  the  capacity  for  effective  internal  audit  in  line \nministries  remains  low,  and  extensive  training  will  be  provided  to  MAFF, \nMOWRAM, and MRD under the program to improve their capacity to undertake \neffective internal audit evaluations. \n \n25.  Governance Indicators. The weaknesses identified above pose significant governance \nrisks and need to be addressed urgently through the rollout of PFM reforms to the three \nministries. ADB\u2019s preliminary performance-based allocations country assessment of 2007 had \n                                                 \n10 Budget Strategic Plan is prepared by each Ministry during the Strategic Planning Phase of budget preparation and \nincludes review of performance, the policy objective to be achieved in the coming budget year and the means to \nachieve them. \n11 Budget classification categorizes expenditure in terms of the purpose for which transactions are undertaken, such \nas administrative, economic, social and general purposes etc. \n12 ADB. 2006.

Weak governance is the foremost \nchallenge that contributes to failures in service delivery to the poor. In a broader context, it is \nalso the most fundamental constraint to improving the weak investment climate and diversifying \nthe economy. In a regional comparative perspective, Cambodia has not performed well in five \nout  of  six  World  Bank  Governance  Indicators  (Table  3).  Improvements  are  being  made, \nespecially  in  PFM  reform.  The  Rectangular  Strategy  for  Growth,  Employment,  Equity  and \nEfficiency,14 adopted by the Government of Cambodia, describes governance as the \u201cmost \nimportant  precondition  to  economic  development\u201d  in  Cambodia. In  2001,  the  Government \napproved a Governance Action Plan (GAP I) to promote multi- and cross-sectoral governance \nreforms. On the basis of that experience, GAP II was formulated in 2005. The National Strategic \nDevelopment Plan (NSDP) 2006\u2013201015 outlines a clear set of measurable and prioritized goals \nfor  achievements  of  the  governance  objectives  embodied  in  the  Rectangular  Strategy. \nCambodia\u2019s decision to join the ADB-OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative and Action Plan for Asia \nand the Pacific in 200316 is demonstrable evidence of its resolve to further the governance \nagenda.  \n \nTable 3: Governance Indicators in 2007 \u2013 Regional Comparison \n(Percentile ranking)a \n \n  Voice and  Political  Government  Regulatory  Rule of  Control of \nCountry  Accountability  Stability  Effectiveness  Quality  Law  Corruption \nPhilippines  43.3  10.1  56.4  50.5  33.8  22.2 \nIndonesia   42.8  14.9  41.7  43.7  27.1  27.1 \nMalaysia   31.3  52.4  82.9  67.0  65.2  62.3 \nThailand   29.8  16.8  61.6  56.3  52.9  44.0 \nViet Nam     6.7  56.3  41.2  35.9  38.6  28.0 \nCambodia  24.0  28.8  20.9  30.6  13.8    8.2 \nLao PDR    6.3  42.8  21.3  15.0  17.1  13.0 \nPDR =  People\u2019s Democratic Republic \na  Note: 2007 data the latest.

The Government \nrecognizes the challenge of rolling out PFM reforms to the rural development ministries. Yet the \ncapacity of the Government to address these issues is severely constrained by the scarcity of \nqualified finance specialists and line managers. The EFI of MEF has prepared a PFM capacity \ndevelopment plan covering a wide range of training and personnel development activities to be \nundertaken during PFMRP Platform 2. MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD staff will participate fully in \nthese activities, with training to be provided by the EFI. In addition, EFI will support capacity \ndevelopment measures under an ongoing ADB regional TA.17 However, it is widely recognized \nthat other capacity-building initiatives will be required to supplement EFI training in order to build \nenduring PFM capacity in rural development ministries. The fundamental lesson that emerged \nfrom an institutional assessment of the PFM capacity in these three ministries (undertaken \nunder ADB Technical Assistance for Preparing the Strengthening of PFMRDP Project, 2008)18 \nis that capacity development is critical to rolling out PFM to these rural development ministries. \n                                                 \n14  RGC. 2004.

Manila \n(TA 4988-CAM). \n ", "14   \nThe assessment also concluded that strengthening capacity in procurement will contribute to \nefficient budget execution and minimize fiduciary risks. In the long-term, this will build stronger \ncountry  systems  to  enable  a  phased  reduction  in  the  number  of  ring-fenced  project \nimplementation  units  (PIUs)  established  for  externally  assisted  projects  in  these  three \nministries.19 On internal audit, the report noted that support to strengthen the internal audit \nfunction in the three priority ministries will be crucial to improving accountability in the delivery of \nservices to rural recipients. Establishing procedures for senior management within the ministries \nto take effective action to implement internal audit recommendations will also be important.20 In \nview of this, the capacity development envisaged under the proposed project assistance will \nsupplement the centralized efforts of EFI and the Public Policy Training Program under the \nregional  TA.  The  Government  and  ADB  are  also  aware  that  capacity  building  will  require \nsufficient incentives to motivate government employees and ensure their commitments to the \nreform programs. Presently, these issues are duly addressed by the Government under the \nbroader Cambodian public administration reform program.21 In addition the establishment of a \nlonger-term  view  on  civil  service  salary  reform  can  help  address  the  current  incentive \nweaknesses in the three line ministries.  \n \n27.  Decentralized Service Delivery. Following the Commune Council elections in February \n2002, the Government has engaged in a broad range of decentralization initiatives. An organic \nlaw on administrative arrangements for subnational level of Government was passed in March \n2008 and a subnational financial law drafted by MEF. MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD will assist \nthe Ministry of Interior and MEF in planning for the assignment or delegation of roles and \nresponsibilities for service delivery to provinces and districts. MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD will \nalso be involved in implementing new financial arrangements, including assigned and shared \nrevenues and fiscal grants for subnational administrations. \n \n28.  Once the Government has determined and found support for the framework for fiscal \ndecentralization, assistance will be required to (i) strengthen decentralization capacity building, \n(ii) strengthen overall PFM control and fiscal decentralization structure, and (iii) increase local \nrevenue generation and improve local service delivery. In this context, there will be a need for \ncapacity building and strengthening institutions at subnational levels in Cambodia. Specific \nattention will be required in progressively improving capacity of MRD, MAFF, and MOWRAM to \nsupport fiscal decentralization in the near term outside the central ministries. The Government \nwill need to accelerate complementary reforms so that laws are not just enacted, but actually \nimplemented and enforced. \n \n29.  Strengthening External Audit and Accountability Mechanisms. Improved external \naccountability, achieved through strengthening the NAA, will play a critical role in improving \nfinancial governance and in detecting and reporting incidences of misuse of resources and \nfinancial irregularities in the public sector. The NAA was established in 2000 as an external, \nindependent  pillar  of  accountability.  ADB  was  instrumental  in  preparing  the  audit  law  and \nestablishing the NAA in Cambodia as the supreme audit institution (SAI) of Cambodia. SAIs are \na pivotal part of the public expenditure management processes. SAIs help ensure strong \ncommitments to poverty reduction and service delivery through the budgetary process, as \n                                                 \n19 PIUs follow the procurement and financial management procedures of donor agencies instead of the national \nsystems to minimize fiduciary risks to project implementation. \n20 Internal auditing is in the early stages of development in Cambodia. The Law on Auditing of 2000 requires each \nministry and state enterprise to establish an internal auditing department. An internal auditing subdecree was \npassed in 2005 and 23 of the 35 budget-funded agencies have established an internal auditing department. \n21 Cambodia\u2019s civil service is not adequately compensated; salary is very low and often is an outright disincentive for \nefficient performance and outcome. \n ", "    15 \nthey have a mandate to audit resources channeled through the national budget system. As an \nincreasing amount of development assistance is provided as budget support, an effective SAI \nhas dual accountability both towards citizens and donors. However, in Cambodia NAA has not \nperformed effectively as an independent pillar of governance and accountability because of \nsignificant capacity constraints and a shortage of auditors. Capacity development for NAA to \neffectively undertake financial and subsequently value-for-money audit should be long-term. \nBesides, NAA has a role in overseeing internal auditing processes in the line ministries. There \nare  no  substantial  or  formalized  interactions  so  far  between  the  NAA  and  the  newly \nestablished internal audit offices within the line ministries. Within the ambit of the Audit Law \n2000, NAA will support effective internal auditing, following international best practices.  \n \nLessons \n \n30.  Ownership  and  capacity  building  are  the  themes  that  have  underpinned  ADB \ngovernance-reform assistance and public expenditure management assistance over the years. \nThey are the same themes that will inform the design of the proposed Program. In Cambodia\u2019s \ninstitutional  and  political  reform  context,  donor  coordination  is  necessary  for  successful \nimplementation. An important lesson learned from previous PFM interventions in Cambodia is \nthat  introducing  complex  PFM  reforms  in  a  capacity-constrained  environment  such  as \nCambodia requires a step-by-step approach to reform. Another lesson is that introducing the \nbroader institutional and organizational changes needed for certain technical PFM reforms to \nwork requires high-level Government commitment and engagement with the reform program. \nThe stage-by-stage approach being used for the PFM reform program allows PFM changes to \nbe introduced gradually, while complementary capacity and skills development will feature as a \nkey component of the final PFM reform program. The key lesson is that it is necessary to \nengage for a longer period of time and to respond flexibly to changes in priorities during \nimplementation. Resident PFM consultants or peripatetic advisers that are actively advising or \nproviding hands-on assistance will help ensure that priority reforms are implemented. \n \n31.  Lessons from two ADB studies (by the Operations Evaluation Department) also suggest \nthat (i) policy reforms involving passage of legislation need sufficient time to allow for consensus \nbuilding and explanation to stakeholders, so delays in the achievement of some expected \noutcomes are likely; (ii) technical assistance for capacity development to institutionalized skills \ntransfer; (iii) it is necessary to pursue governance issues not only at the project/program level, \nbut also at the level of donors\u2019 collective policy dialogue to ensure Government commitment to \naddressing widespread corruption; (iv) support for capacity development should focus not only \non institutionalizing skills transfer, with a clear exit strategy, but also on improving organizational \nmanagement and budgeting systems; and (v) the existing deterrence factor in terms of low \npublic salary structure tends to deter some expected outcomes by reducing the retention and/or \nutilization of trained staff.22 These studies also suggest that it takes time to fully integrate the \nmedium-term expenditure framework into the annual budget cycles.  \n \nV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n \n32.  Objectives  and  Scope.  The  program\u2019s  objective  is  to  assist  in  implementing  the \nPFMRP, particularly in the three rural development ministries. To achieve these objectives \nwithin the ongoing PFM reform program, the program will support Government reforms in three \n                                                 \n22 ADB. 2004 Country Assistance Program Evaluation for Cambodia.

The PFMRDP will target (i) the capacity development needs of \nMAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD in the areas of budget planning, budget preparation and execution, \nprocurement,  and  internal  audit  with  the  goal  of  ensuring  better  service  delivery  to  rural \ncommunities;  and  (ii)  the  capacity  development  needs  of  the  NAA  to  improve  the  overall \ngovernance framework of the Cambodian public sector. Overall, the objective is to strengthen \nfinancial governance and public expenditure efficiency as an enabling condition for poverty \nreduction. Besides, the objective is also to strengthen external auditing capacity to improve the \neffectiveness  of  NAA  as  a  pillar  of  accountability  in  Cambodia,  as  highlighted  in  the \ndevelopment policy letter addressed to the President of ADB (Appendix 2).  \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s Contribution to Subprogram 1 Core Policy Actions. ADB has contributed \nsignificantly since 2005 to strengthening PFM in Cambodia. ADB assisted the Government in \n2004 and 2005 with the following: (i) setting up an internal audit function, initially in MEF; and (ii) \nstrengthening  the  institutional  structure  of  the  NAA  (through  TA  for  Strengthening  Public \nFinancial  Management).23 Also,  the  project  assisted  MEF  with  establishing  a  medium-term \nexpenditure  framework  and  improving  its  macroeconomic  forecasting  capability.  ADB  also \nsupported MEF to establish a debt management function (under TA for Support to Public \nFinancial Management Program).24 A monitoring and evaluation framework has been prepared, \nand MAFF has been employing the new monitoring procedure since 2007 to keep track of the \nperformance  of  five  of  its  programs.  This  has  contributed  to  increased  accountability  and \nimproved service delivery within MAFF (ADB 2004/05, TA for Strengthening National Program \nBudgeting for the Agriculture Sector).25 An ADB TA (Preparing the Strengthening of Public \nFinancial Management for Rural Development Project)26 has made detailed recommendations \non training for MAFF, MRD, MOWRAM, and NAA to provide the basis for institutional and \ncapacity development in PFM in rural development ministries. \n \n34.  Program Cluster Modality. The proposed Program comprises a grant component of $6.71 \nmillion for subprogram 1. The second subprogram of the overall cluster is currently estimated at \n$15.0 million. Structured in two sequential subprograms under the program cluster modality with two \nsingle  tranche  operations  (subprogram  1:  June  2006\u2013December  2008;  subprogram  2:  January \n2009\u2013December 2010), the Program is anchored in a coherent, medium-term framework specified at \nthe outset, including completed reforms prior to Board consideration under subprogram 1; and (ii) \nexpected  triggers  for  subprogram  2  to  facilitate  a  continuous  dialogue  with  the  Government. \nSubprogram 2 will be further refined during a subprogram impact review to allow flexibility to adjust \nthe Program based on progress made and changes in the external environment. This does not \nobligate ADB to provide an additional grant for subprogram 2, which will be subject to Board \napproval. It is expected that subprogram 2 will be submitted to the ADB Board for consideration in \n2010 upon completion of the key triggers. Appendix 3 presents the proposed policy matrix for the \ncluster program. It details the policy actions for subprogram 1 and policy triggers and milestones \nfor subprogram 2.  \n                                                 \n23 ADB.  2001.

PFMRDP: Subprogram 1 Policy Actions27 \n \n1.  Component 1: Strengthening Financial Management Framework to Increase \nAccountability \n \n35.  The new Public Financial System Law, promulgated in May 2008, superseded the 1993 \nFinancial System Law. It provides a legal framework for the stage-by-stage implementation of \nPFMRP to improve Cambodia\u2019s PFM system, with the goal of bringing it in line with international \nstandards.  MAFF,  MOWRAM,  and  MRD  all  established  their  PFM  working  groups  and \ncommenced  PFM  reform  planning  by  the  end  of  June  2008.  These  working  groups  have \nbecome  the  focal  points  for  accelerating  PFM  reforms  in  these  ministries.  Thus,  a  key \nrequirement under subprogram 1 that all ministries establish PFM working groups to plan and \nimplement their ministries\u2019 involvement in PFMRP stage 2 already has significant momentum. \n \n36.  One major activity has been streamlining the ability of line agencies to spend in line with \ntheir budget provisions. To that end, MEF has decentralized procurement to spending agencies \nunder a new procurement decree and prakas and implemented annual procurement plans.28 \nWithin certain monetary thresholds, ministries are now free to make their own procurement \ndecisions  without  prior  MEF  approval.  In  preparation  for  further  procurement  reforms,  the \nprogram  has  considered  the  preparation  of  terms  of  reference  for  a  procurement  auditing \nfunction to be established in MEF\u2019s department of public procurement. \n \n37.  The  budget  execution  rate  is  being  improved  and  fiduciary  risks  reduced  through \nincreased  use  of  the  banking  system  (rather  than  cash)  for  Government  transactions. \nImprovements  in  cash  management  have  been  made,  including  further  consolidation  of \nGovernment bank accounts and streamlining of Government expenditure commitments and \npayments processes. Budget preparation and budget execution are being improved through the \nintroduction of new economic and administrative classifications in the chart of accounts and \nbudget classification, commencing in 2007. Fiscal transparency is being improved through the \npublication of an annual budget summary. Further transparency reforms are planned, including \npublication of an annual budget document, in-year budget execution reports, and public release \nof audited public financial accounts after they have been submitted to the National Assembly. \nThe Annual Finance Law for 2008 includes a budget summary of total revenues, the budgets for \nrecurrent expenditures, including the Public Investment Program (PIP) project lines for capital \nexpenditure, as an initial step towards budget integration.  \n \n38.  Revised MBPI Subdecree 29, which provides a framework for all ministries to provide \nincentives to civil servants for improved performance and to participate in the PFM reform \nprogram, was approved by the Prime Minister in April 2008.29 The Government plans to expand \nthe MBPI scheme to encompass a broader range of recipients from the line ministries. Initially \n                                                 \n27 Subprograms  1  and  2  have  drawn  upon  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  inputs  and \nrecommendations  (4988-CAM:  Preparing  the  Strengthening  of  Public  Financial  Management  for  Rural \nDevelopment Project). \n28 Prakas are ministerial or inter-ministerial regulations that are used, like Sub-Decrees, to implement and clarify \nspecific provisions within higher-level legislative documents. They are also often used for the creation of guidelines \nthat are necessary for the implementation of Laws or Sub-Decrees. \n29 The MBPI was initially piloted in MEF in 2005. The essence of the MBPI is to introduce into the civil service higher \npay coupled with meritocratic selection and performance management on a sustainable basis to support agencies\u2019 \nmissions.  MBPI  is  anchored  in  official  Government  pay  policy  (Subdecree  98),  supported  by  a  specific \nmemorandum of understanding for the management of MBPI from the Multi-Donor Trust Fund. Management of \nMBPI is based on MBPI Manual developed by MEF (and endorsed by development partners). MBPI is supervised \nby MEF\u2019s Reform Committee\u2019s Incentives and Recruitment Subcommittee.  \n ", "18   \nthe scheme will target representatives of the PFM working groups entrusted with implementing \nPFMRP in the ministries. \n \n39.  The Debt Management Office within the MEF, set up with ADB TA, is fully operational \nand integrated with other departments within MEF responsible for macroeconomic policy and \nbudgets. Under the ADB TA, the MEF strengthened the Debt Management Office (DMO) by \nproducing a model debt management strategy and made recommendations on improving the \nlegal framework for public debt management. Core recommendations were included in the \nrevised Public Financial System Law promulgated in May 2008. The Debt Management Office \ninstalled a debt management and financial analysis system, and prepared standard operating \nprocedures (SOPs), including a debt management manual. In addition, under the ADB TA, debt \nmanagement  capacity  was  strengthened  to  enhance  budget  resource  mobilization  and  to \nimprove budget sustainability.  \n \n2.  Component 2: Strengthened Financial Management in the Rural Sector \n \n40.  Significant  progress  has  been  made  in  PFM  reform  in  the  rural  ministries  (MAFF, \nMOWRAM, and MRD) during the PFMRDP implementation period. Budget planning has been \nimproved through the introduction of budget strategic plans (BSPs), which link preparation of the \nbudget to ministries\u2019 strategic goals at a number of pilot ministries, including MAFF and MRD. \nThe BSP has been used as an instrument to integrate the current, capital, and development \npartner\u2019s budgets. BSPs improve budget integration and comprehensiveness. All line ministries \nare required to prepare and submit their BSPs to MEF in mid-May each year. BSPs form the \nbasis for budget estimates and help link policy to budget allocation. A BSP is a bottom-up, 3-\nyear budget plan that includes both capital and recurrent budgets. The three rural development \nministries have been preparing BSPs since 2007.   \n \n41.  Planning for a Government-wide financial management information system (FMIS) has \nprogressed  in  platform  1.  MAFF  and  MRD  are  piloting  FMIS  action  plans,  which  will  be \nintroduced in several other ministries and provincial treasuries from 2010. The FMIS is expected \nto significantly improve the efficiency of budget execution and budget reporting. The PFMRDP \nwill supplement MEF capacity development efforts and will facilitate client-side capacity building \nin  the  areas  of  budget  accounting,  budget  classification,  and  Information  Technology  (IT) \nsystems. Capacity building will be implemented in phases and will target senior-level, technical, \nand operational-level MAFF staff. Specialist training will be provided where required. \n \n42.  The Memorandum of Understanding between the Government and the ADB signed in \nApril 2007 concluded that the overall performance of ADB\u2019s finance portfolio is in need of \nimprovement.  Since  2003,  annual  contract  awards  and  disbursement  achievements  have \nremained significantly below annual projections. The majority of ongoing projects is behind \nschedule and will likely need to be extended. The slow pace of project implementation increases \nthe Government\u2019s costs and delays the realization of project benefits. In light of these delays, \nwhich  have  added  to  the  governance  challenges  in  Cambodia,  all  national  programs  and \nprojects for Cambodia, including those of MAFF, MRD, and MOWRAM, are required to prepare \nand comply with good governance frameworks (GGFs). Further, the ADB-financed projects for \nCambodia  have  incorporated  several  requirements\u2014in  addition  to  the  standard  ADB \nrequirements\u2014to deter corruption and increase transparency. First, ADB-financed projects now \nincorporate  disclosure  and  grievance  redress  measures,  including  (i)  a  project  website  to \ndisclose information about procurement and other project activities, and (ii) a grievance redress \nmechanism to encourage more stakeholder vigilance and ensure greater accountability. The \ngovernment has signed the GGF in respect to ADB-financed projects in 2007 (Tonle Sap \n ", "    19 \nLowland Rural Development Project, Enhancing Education Quality Project and Financial Sector \nProgram II cluster). A website is being set up in MOWRAM (this is near completion). The \nPFMRDP  will  complement  ongoing  efforts  under  PFMRP  to  establish  a  Government-wide \nprocurement website. \n \n43.  For ADB- and World Bank-assisted projects, Cambodia has adopted a variety of project- \nand/or program-level mitigation measures, including the application of Government SOPs and \nprocurement manuals in the administration of programs and projects (Supported under TA for \nHarmonizing  Loan  Project  Implementation  Procedures).30 For  externally  aided  loans  and \nprojects, MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD are adopting these measures and will be applying them \nto the execution of all ADB funded projects and programs. Compliance with these procedures \nwill strengthen efforts to promote responsibility for procurement planning and processing, and \nwill  constitute  a  major  step  in  achieving  the  harmonization  envisaged  in  the  2005  Paris \nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness.31 The proposed ADB project under PFMRDP will provide \ntraining  and  continuous  mentor  support  to  the  project  management  units  to  comply  with   \nprocurement manuals and consistently observe the SOPs in project implementation. \n  \n44.  Internal auditing, which is necessary for efficient management control and reduction of \nfiduciary risks is in the early stages of introduction in Cambodia. MAFF, MRD and MOWRAM \nhave established internal audit departments. The internal audit department (IAD) is mandated to \nundertake financial and compliance audits. In addition, the internal audit department is required \nto ensure compliance with the ministry\u2019s internal control systems; to verify the accuracy of \nfinancial and operational reports; besides guaranteeing the adequacy of the systems in place to \nsafeguard assets. The IAD is also required to coordinate internal audit findings with the NAA, \nand to submit copies of internal audit reports to the NAA. Twenty-two staff members have been \nappointed to IAD in MAFF, and 19 staff members have been recruited to join the IAD in \nMOWRAM.  In  2007  MAFF  completed  40  assignments  and  MOWRAM  completed  five \nassignments. \n \n45.  The EFI of MEF has prepared a PFM capacity development plan covering a wide range \nof training and personnel-development activities to be undertaken during PFMRP platform 2. \nThe  PFM  capacity  development  plan  was  approved  in  August  2008.  Of  the  23  courses \nproposed by EFI to support the activities of platform 2, 15 courses have been finalized and 8 \ncourses still need to be developed. MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD staff will participate fully in \nthese activities, with training to be provided by the EFI or by ADB-funded advisers to the rural \ndevelopment  ministries.  In  conjunction  with  the  recommendations  of  ADB  TA,  capacity \ndevelopment will become a central focus of PFM roll-out to MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD. \n \n46.  Decentralization reforms will strengthen the impact of development projects through \nparticipation of rural communities in the decision making process on issues that impact their \nlives. In addition, provision of adequate resources to the subnational levels of Government \nthrough the envisaged fiscal decentralization (by designated and shared taxes and fiscal grants) \nwill contribute to improved service delivery. An organic law on administrative arrangements for \nsubnational levels of government was passed in March 2008, and a subnational financial law \nwas drafted by MEF. The three rural development ministries\u2014MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD\u2014\nwill be engaged with the Ministry of Interior and MEF in planning the assignment or delegation \n                                                 \n30 ADB. 2004.

MAFF, MOWRAM, \nand MRD will also be involved in implementing new financial arrangements, including assigned \nand shared revenues and fiscal grants, for subnational administrations. \n \n47.  The management of water resources and irrigation is one of the priority actions under \nthe  2004  National  Water  Resources  Policy  and  the  NSDP  2006\u20132010.  MOWRAM  is \ncommitted to translating this national policy and strategic direction on farmer water user\u2019s \ncommunities (FWUC) into action. The collective aim is to have a regulatory framework that \nprovides a sound legal basis for FWUC that will formally define its roles and responsibilities. \nThe Law on Water Resources Management was enacted in July 2007. The passage of the \n\u201cWater Law\u201d has cleared the way for MOWRAM to proceed with the final preparation of the \ndraft subdecree on FWUC to strengthen and expand FWUC, to enable them to participate in \nwater  management  and  allocation  and  to  maintain  the  effectiveness  of  irrigation \ninfrastructure. \n \n3.  Component 3: Strengthened External Audit \n \n48.  PFMRDP recognizes the NAA as the key institution that will report independently to the \nparliament and the public on whether public resources have been accounted for and managed \neffectively. To enable NAA to discharge its functions properly, it is essential that the NAA has \nthe  skills  and  competence  to  undertake  audits  effectively.  NAA  prepared  a  Strategic \nDevelopment Plan 2007\u20132011 in 2007. This provides the basis for its current audit planning, \nincluding training and capacity building. The NAA is being provided with project assistance and \na peer review will be undertaken by another reputable SAI to enable it to develop an action plan \nfor improving its performance. The NAA has endorsed the terms of reference for the audit peer \nreview (APR). The NAA\u2019s willingness to accept an APR is evidence of its commitment to adopt \ninternational best practices. To ensure timely and audited accounts, over the last year the NAA \ncompleted audits of the Government\u2019s accounts. These audits covered several years through \n2005. The NAA is currently working on the 2006 accounts. The completed audited accounts for \n2002, 2003, and 2004 have been submitted to the National Assembly, but not published. \n \nB.  PFMRDP Medium Term Program: Subprogram 2 Indicative Policy Actions \n \n49.  The PFMRDP outlines major elements of the Government\u2019s PFM reform agenda for rural \ndevelopment ministries for the next 2 years, building on the momentum from subprogram 1. \nIndicative policy actions for subprogram 2 are included in the policy matrix in Appendix 3.  \n \n1.  Component  1:  Strengthening  the  Financial  Management  Framework  to \nIncrease Accountability \n \n50.  Five triggers are proposed for component 1 of subprogram 2. The establishment of a \nrural development subworking group (under the economic sector working group) will be the first \ntrigger.  This is essential to achieving proper focus and coordination of PFM reform measures in \nMAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD. Effective implementation of the ministry action plans are among \nother actions envisaged to give operational guidance to implement PFM reforms in MAFF, \nMOWRAM, and MRD by 2009. The program will allow the release of resources to assist the \nPFM working groups that have been formed in MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD with implementing \ntheir reform tasks.  \n \n51.  Procurement reform is expected to receive legal sanction with the proposed passage by \nthe  legislature  of  the Procurement  Law.  New  implementing  rules  and  regulations  are  also \n ", "    21 \nenvisaged. There will be procurement oversight by the MEF through regular ex-post reviews of \nprocurement activities undertaken by line ministries. In addition, there will be further training of \nprocurement staff in line ministries. The second trigger of this component proposes drafting the \nProcurement Law by 2009. MEF will increase the transparency of the procurement process by \nsetting up a procurement website to advertise all Government bidding opportunities, and by \nrequiring line ministries to post all bidding opportunities to the website. Training will be provided \nto MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD staff on accessing the website.  The third trigger is proposed in \nthe  context  of  improving  civil  service  incentives,  and  it  is  expected  that  the  Council  for \nAdministrative Reform will accomplish broader salary reform initiatives within the PFM reform \nframework.32 The subprogram will also include preparation of implementing instructions for the \nnew public financial system law (the organic budget law) by 2009. \n \n52.  Two triggers in this component relate to further reforms in public debt management.  The \nfirst is to complete the drafting by 2009 of the proposed Public Debt Subdecree, which will \ninclude provisions for debt and risk management, government on-lending, and government \nguarantees. The second trigger is preparation of a debt management strategy by 2010. Both of \nthese reforms are essential for establishing a proper institutional basis for debt management. \nOther debt management reforms that are to be implemented include establishment of a middle-\noffice function in the Debt Management Office in MEF (to improve risk analysis, debt portfolio \nmanagement, and other functions) and enhanced training in the use of the debt-management \ndatabase. As an efficient debt-management system is essential to a well-functioning public \nsector, ADB will continue its involvement in this area by providing significant further assistance \nfor institutional and capacity development under the program cluster. \n \n53.  For  increased  efficiency  of  budget  execution  and  improved  budget  reporting  it  is \nproposed that (i) the use of the banking system for Government revenue and expenditure \ntransactions  be  expanded  further  by  2010;  and  (ii)  quarterly  and  annual  budget  reports, \nincluding the audited annual financial statements which are submitted to the National Assembly, \nbe publicly released. \n \n2.  Component 2: Strengthened Financial Management in the Rural Sector \n \n54.  Five triggers are proposed for component 2 of subprogram 2. The first trigger is that \nMAFF,  MOWRAM,  and  MRD  will  comply  with  an  existing  requirement  to  submit  monthly \nprocurement  activity  reports  to  MEF  from  2009.  This  reporting  requirement  is  essential  to \nimproving budget execution rates and reducing fiduciary risks. In order to increase transparency \nin procurement, it is also proposed under the program that MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD post all \nof their procurement bidding opportunities to the Government procurement website by the third \nquarter of 2010. \n \n55.  By 2010, MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD will be fully applying the SOPs, the harmonized \nprocurement manual, and the financial management manual mandated in 2007 (supported \nunder ADB TA for Harmonizing Loan Project Implementation Procedures) for all ADB projects \n(second trigger). In the third trigger, it is proposed that the three rural development ministries will \ncomply with the requirements of good governance frameworks (GGFs) in implementation of all \ncurrent and future ADB programs and projects. These will be effective measures to reduce \nfiduciary risks to project implementation. Budget comprehensiveness and transparency will be \n                                                 \n32 Council for Administrative Reform (CAR) is a high-level group located in the Council of Ministers and responsible \nto determine a comprehensive policy for administrative reform.  \n \n ", "22   \nimproved  by  requiring  MAFF,  MOWRAM,  and  MRD  to  include  all  Government-funded \nexpenditures  and  at  least  50%  of  donor-financed  expenditures  in  their  budgets  by  2010. \nResources for sustainable management of the national water system are also expected to be \nmade available to MOWRAM by 2009 from the proposed water user charges subdecree.  \n \n56.  Strengthening the financial management system will improve the effectiveness of service \ndelivery to the rural population. The new FMIS will be piloted in selected ministries, including \nMAFF and MRD, by 2010. Full adoption of the new functional and program classifications for \nbudget classification and chart of accounts by MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD will improve budget \npreparation and execution by the fourth quarter of 2009. The adoption and implementation of a \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  framework  by  MOWRAM  and  MRD  by  2010  will  improve \naccountability and service delivery. \n \n57.  The fourth trigger of this component will be completion of training by internal audit staff in \nMAFF,  MOWRAM,  and  MRD  by  2011.  The  training  under  PFMRDP  will  build  on  the \nrecommendations of ADB TA (4988-CAM). Other internal audit reforms are operationalizing the \nexisting internal audit units in MAFF, MRD, MOWRAM fully by the fourth quarter of 2010 and \nestablishing procedures for effective follow-up of internal audit recommendations by MAFF, \nMOWRAM,  and  MRD  senior  management  by  2010.  To  ensure  accountability,  MAFF, \nMOWRAM, and MRD internal audit units will submit their reports to MEF and NAA for quality \ncontrol purposes by 2010. To meet reporting requirements under the audit law and generally \naccepted audit standards, internal audit report mechanisms and procedures will be introduced. \n \n58.  To improve service delivery to rural communities, it is expected that MAFF, MOWRAM, \nand MRD will delegate new roles and responsibilities to provinces and districts by 2010 with \ncommensurate financial resources. These financial provisions are intended to give provincial \ndepartments under rural development ministries sufficient resources, in the form of assigned \nand shared revenues and fiscal grants, to meet their service delivery mandates. The fifth trigger \nof  this  component  is  that  at  least  75%  of  the  training  component  of  the  PFM  Capacity \nDevelopment Plan will be delivered in MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD by the fourth quarter of \n2010. \n \n3.  Component 3: Strengthened External Audit \n \n59.  There is one trigger in this component which relates to the Audit Peer Review (APR), \nproposed to be undertaken in 2009 by another SAI. The adoption and implementation of an \naction plan arising from the recommendations of the APR by 2010 will contribute to improving \nNAA\u2019s performance. The recommendations of the APR will support the overarching objectives \nof NAA\u2019s Strategic Development Plan and contribute to NAA institutional strengthening over the \nmedium term. Implementation subdecrees for the Audit Law will be developed that will clarify \nthe role and functions of NAA. With capacity development support, it is envisaged that NAA will \nbe  strengthened  to  effectively  undertake  financial,  compliance,  and  performance  audits  of \nprojects funded by overseas development assistance. Procedures will be in place to strengthen \nmechanisms for improved interface between internal audit offices and NAA. Considering the \nenormity and complexities of training staff to be professional auditors, much more assistance \nneeds to be provided if NAA is to become an effective SAI.  \n \n ", "    23 \nFigure 5: Overview of the PFMRDP \nStrategic Framework: Public Financial Management Reform Program \nPFMRDP Cluster \u2013  Government's PFM  ADB's Sector \nSeries of 2 single- Sector Strategies  Programs and \ntranche grants from  grant-financed \n2008 to 2010  projects \nCore Area 1  \u2022  Fiscal consolidation, and increased  \u2022  Support to debt \n  revenue collection  management through the \n\u2022  Strengthen PFM Policy  \u2022  Continue capacity building in the  proposed Project \nFramework and Incentive  function of the debt management  \u2022  Financial Sector Program \nSystem  office, and associated procedures and  Cluster \n\u2022  Improve Expenditure  manuals   \u2022  Promoting Economic \nEfficiency  \u2022  Promulgation of Revised Public  Diversification Program \n\u2022  Strengthen Debt  Financial System Law  \u2022  PFM support to rural \nManagement  \u2022  Strengthen PFM reform monitoring  development \n  coordination mechanism \n\u2022  Procurement deconcentration \n\u2022  Greater use of the banking system \nand streamlined cash management \nCore Area 2  \u2022  Continue improvement of budget  \u2022  Support to public financial \n  strategic framework  management  in  MRD, \n\u2022  Improve budget planning and  \u2022  Improve budget comprehensiveness  MAFF, and MOWRAM \ncomprehensiveness  and integration  \u2022  Capacity  development  in \n\u2022  Strengthen budget execution,  \u2022  Strengthen implementation of revised  internal audit \nincluding procurement  budget classification  \u2022  Sector  investment \n\u2022  Improve budget accounting,  \u2022  Improved budget execution and  program (earlier ADB TA \nmonitoring and Reporting  transaction process  for strengthening national \n\u2022  Improve internal audit  \u2022  Systematic procurement plan and  program budgeting for the \noversight  compliance with procurement  agriculture sector) \n\u2022  Improve service delivery  procedures, SOPs, PM, and FMM \n\u2022  Sustain capacity  \u2022  Adoption of good governance \ndevelopment in PFM  framework \n\u2022  Piloting FMIS in MAFF \n\u2022  Adoption of monitoring and evaluation \nframework \n\u2022  Improve internal audit oversight  \nCore Area 3  \u2022  Audit Law  \u2022  Support to NAA in \n  \u2022  Strategic Development Plan 2007\u2013 undertaking an external \n\u2022  Strengthen role,  2011  peer review \nindependence and  \u2022  Improve audit capacity for audit of  \u2022  Capacity development in \neffectiveness of NAA   externally aided projects   externally assisted \n  \u2022  Institutional framework improved for  projects \ninternal and external audit interface  \u2022  Facilitating \nImplementations decrees \nunder the Audit Law \nFMIS = Financial Management Information System, NAA = National Audit Authority, PM = Procurement Manual, \nFMM = Financial Management Manual, PFM = Public Financial Management, SOP = Standard Operating \nProcedures. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \n \n ", "24   \nC.  Important Features \n \n60.  The PFMRDP has several distinctive features. First, it strengthens ADB\u2019s partnership \nwith the Government. By basing financial assistance on completed actions derived from the \nGovernment\u2019s own reform program, PFMRDP strengthens Government ownership of strategies \nrecommended by development partners. Second, the inclusion of policy triggers and milestone \nactions for subprogram 2 helps facilitate broad-based dialogue on PFM in the rural development \nministries in the medium term context, with reforms flowing sequentially on from the first to the \nsecond subprogram. Third, the PFMRDP helps establish an institutional mechanism to achieve \nbetter interagency coordination and implementation of reforms right across the central and line \nministries  of  the  Government.  Finally,  the  program  cluster  approach  helps  lay  out  a \ncomprehensive  set  of  complex  reforms  in  a  well-sequenced  fashion.  The  single-tranche \nprogram cluster funding gives good flexibility to adjust to changing circumstances within the \nlonger-term  cluster  concept,  while  focusing  on  achievable  up-front  outcomes,  including \ncompletion of high-impact outcomes prior to each respective Board consideration of financing. \n  \nD.  Financing Plan \n \n61.  The Government has requested a grant of $6.71 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources to help finance subprogram 1 of the PFM program, with such terms and conditions as \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to \nthe Board. Cambodia has been classified as a category A borrower since ADB resumed lending \noperations  in  1992,  and  could  receive  up  to  50%  of  its  total  assistance  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) in the form of grants under the ADF IX grants allocation framework, \nas spelled out in ADF IX Donor\u2019s Report: Development Effectiveness for Poverty Reduction. \nThe ADF funds are to support the reform measures outlined in the development policy letter \n(Appendix 2) and policy matrix (Appendix 3). The grant size was determined by the strength of \nthe policy package, its development impact, the importance of the sectors covered, and the \ndevelopment financing needs of the Government, as estimated by MEF. \n \n62.  Period and Tranching. The implementation period for subprogram 1 is from June 2006 \nto 31 December 2008, with a single tranche grant of $6.71 million to be disbursed under \nsubprogram 1. The closing date of the grant will be 90 days from the date the Government has \nmet the conditions for grant effectiveness. Policy actions for subprogram 2 are subject to \nrevision  and  refinement  following  ADB\u2019s  assessment  of  the  macroeconomic  environment, \nlessons learned from implementing subprogram 1, and the overall progress of PFM reforms. \nSubprogram 2 will be presented for Board consideration and approval based on the progress \nachieved in implementing subprogram 1, including the status of compliance with the proposed \npolicy actions, and the readiness of the Government to undertake the succeeding policy reform \nmeasures. The implementation period for subprogram 2 is expected to be within 24 months \nfrom subprogram 1 grant effectiveness.  \n \n63.  Counterpart  Funds. The Government will use the local-currency counterpart funds \ngenerated by the grant proceeds to primarily meet program expenditures and associated costs \nof reform. \n \n64.  Program Grant Reflects the Development Financing Needs of the Government \n(Table  4).  Given  the  narrow  revenue  base,  selective  and  focused  grant  assistance  will \nrepresent  a  major  addition  to  resource  availability.  The  program  cluster  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to increase the primary budget surplus by mobilizing more domestic \nresources, thereby striking a balance between containing inflation in 2008 and meeting priority \n ", "    25 \ndevelopment spending. However, the Government\u2019s gross and net financing needs will be \nsignificant if it is to sustain economic growth of more than 7% over the medium term and \nreduce poverty to 28% by 2010. The Government aims to increase development and social \nspending in 2008 and 2009. According to MEF budget estimates, the net financing (primarily \nexternal) requirements for 2008 are estimated at $451.3 million. Over the longer term, the \nGovernment  envisages  reducing  external  debt  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  as  the  economy \ncontinues to expand. A recently updated debt sustainability assessment (DSA) by the IMF \nconcluded that Cambodia\u2019s debt is sustainable and that the country faces only a moderate risk \nof debt distress over a medium-term period up to 2027, provided GDP growth remains robust \nand large-scale concessional financing from both traditional donors and new development \npartners is sustained.The proposed grant of $6.71 million, along with project assistance of $4.1 \n \nmillion will help close the financing gap for 2008, as well as support the Government\u2019s reforms \nin  PFM,  including  strengthening  the  debt  management  office  and  developing  a  debt \nmanagement strategy.  \n \nTable 4: Government of Cambodia\u2019s Projected Financing Requirements for 2008 \n($ million) \n \nProposed  \nFinancing Mix                                                                \nAmounts \n1.

Program Management \n \n65.  The coordination and program management structures established by the Government \nfor its public financial management reform program (PFMRP), and as described below, shall be \nused to facilitate implementation of the Program. The Government\u2019s Economic and Financial \nPolicy Committee chaired by the deputy prime minister and minister of the Ministry of Economy \nand Finance and comprising other key ministers and secretaries of state of line ministries shall \nprovide overall policy guidance. The  Government\u2019s steering committee on PFM (PSC), chaired \nby the secretary of state of the MEF and comprising the deputy governor of the National Bank of \nCambodia, the secretary general of the Cambodia Rehabilitation and Development Board, and \nsenior representatives in charge of finance at the level of secretary general or director general in \ncharge of finance shall be the program steering committee (PSC) for PFMRDP responsible for \ncoordinating  program  implementation  and  sustaining  of  subprogram  1  actions  by  relevant \nministries and agencies of the Government. The PFM working groups established at each of the \nspending ministries, and chaired by the relevant member of the PSC for PFM shall support \n ", "26   \nProgram implementation at the ministry level. The PSC for PFM shall meet as required to: (a) \nreview progress reports from the PFM working groups; (b) monitor progress and oversee the \nimplementation of the Program; and (c) provide guidance and direction to relevant line agencies \nof the Government involved in Program actions and activities. The PSC for PFM shall ensure that \nthe reforms are undertaken in line with the agreed timetable and may invite ADB to participate in \nits meetings as an observer The PSC for PFM will provide the link between two subprograms. \nMEF  shall  be  the  Program  Executing  Agency  and  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall \nimplementation of pillars 1 and 2 of subprogram 1; including compliance with all policy actions, \nprogram administration, disbursements, and maintenance of all program records, reporting to \nADB. NAA will be the Executing Agency for the audit pillar of PFMRDP. \n \n2.  Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements \n \n66.  The grant of $6.71 million will be released in a single tranche upon effectiveness (i.e., all \nconditions in the subprogram 1 policy matrix in Appendix 3 must be satisfactorily complied with \nprior to release of the tranche). The grant proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign \nexchange cost of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible \nitems, and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The proceeds of the \nprogram  grant  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement \nProcedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,  with  the  Government  as  the \nBeneficiary. 33  In  accordance  with  the  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and  related \nrequirements  for  program  loans,  all  goods  and  services  produced  and  originating  in  ADB \nmember  countries  will  be  procured,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  and  normal  private  sector \ncommercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international \ncommodity market will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Prior  to  withdrawal,  the  Government  will  open  or  nominate  a  deposit \naccount with the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) to receive the grant proceeds. The account \nwill  be  managed,  operated,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  terms  satisfactory  to  ADB. \nSubprogram 1 will provide for retroactive financing for eligible expenditures incurred by the \nGovernment up to 180 days prior to grant effectiveness.  \n \n3.  Anticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n \n67.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Program and related project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the program grant and grant-financed project shall include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the \nexecuting agencies and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. \n \n68.  The design of the PFMRDP is anchored in the governance framework. Cambodia\u2019s \nfinancial management and fiduciary arrangements are deemed satisfactory for the purpose of \nPFMRDP  (Fiduciary  Risk  Assessment  at  Supplementary  Appendix  B).  The  Government  is \n                                                 \n33 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "    27 \ncommitted to key governance reforms as a policy priority.34 Cambodia has achieved good \nprogress in undertaking PFM reforms. For ADB projects, Cambodia has adopted a variety of \nproject- and/or program-level mitigation measures including the application of the Government's \nSOPs and the procurement manuals in the administration of program and projects (Supported \nunder TA for Harmonizing Loan Project Implementation Procedures). ADB-financed projects for \nCambodia  have  incorporated  several  additional  measures,  on  top  of  the  standard  ADB \nrequirements, to deter corruption and increase transparency. First, ADB-financed projects now \nincorporate disclosure and grievance redress measures, including (i) development of a project \nwebsite  to  disclose  information  about  procurement  and  other  project  activities;  and  (ii) \nestablishing  a  grievance-redress  mechanism  to  encourage  more  stakeholder  vigilance  and \nensure  greater  accountability  Second,  all  ADB-financed  projects  for  Cambodia  have  also \nincorporated good governance frameworks (GGFs), which the Government has been signing \nsince 2007.  \n  \n4.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n69.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of the grant proceeds and to verify the accuracy of \nthe Government\u2019s certification for the withdrawal application. The Executing Agencies will be \nrequired  to  submit  a  final  report  on  the  progress  of  subprogram  1  implementation  for \nincorporation with an overall program cluster report. ADB will, in cooperation with the Executing \nAgencies, carry out periodic reviews of progress with the program cluster implementation, and \nassess  its  impact.  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  the  outcome  of  policy \ndiscussions with other multilateral and bilateral agencies that have implications for the program \ncluster implementation, and will provide ADB with the opportunity to comment on any resulting \npolicy proposals.  \n \n5.  Performance Evaluation and Program Review \n \n70.  In  coordination  with  the  Program  Steering  Committee,  ADB  will  carry  out  periodic \nreviews  of  the  progress  of  implementation  and  assess  the  impact  of  the  Program.  The \nGovernment will keep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral \nand bilateral agencies that have implications for program implementation, and will provide ADB \nwith the opportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals. Based on regular progress \nreports from Executing Agencies and the PSC, ADB will also monitor progress over the baseline \ndata and coordinate monitoring and evaluation of the program given the many implementation \nagencies involved. ADB will, in collaboration with the PSC, undertake a review of program \nperformance 12 months after grant effectiveness to review the outcome of subprogram 1 and \nprepare for subprogram 2. The Executing Agencies will submit within 30 days of the grant \neffectiveness of subprogram 1, a report that will evaluate implementation of the policy reform \nmeasures under subprogram 1, and assess the impact of subprogram 1, describe lessons \nidentified during the subprogram period, and outline reforms and assistance needed for the \ndevelopment of the economy, to enable processing of subprogram 2. \n \n71.  ADB, in cooperation with MEF, will review the progress of program implementation and \nassess the Program\u2019s impact on the structure and development of PFM. The Government and \nADB will continue to engage in active policy dialogue on sector issues, policy reforms, and other \n                                                 \n34 These reform areas are highlighted in key policy documents including the Rectangular Strategy for Growth, \nEmployment, Equity, and Efficiency for the third mandate of the RGC, 2003\u20132008; the subsequent National \nStrategic  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010;  Public  Financial  Management  Reform  Program\u2013Strengthening \nGovernance Through Enhanced Public Financial Management, 2004; and the Second Governance Action Plan \n2005\u20132008.    \n ", "28   \nmeasures during the cluster program period and on additional reforms that may be considered \nnecessary or desirable. The Government (MEF) will prepare and provide ADB with a program \ncompletion report on the overall impact of the policy reforms implemented within 3 months of \ncompletion of the Program. \n \nVI.  GRANT ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n \n72.  To support the implementation of the PFMRP, the Government of Cambodia requested \nthat ADB provide grant assistance to support institutional and capacity development over the \nmedium term. Implementation of PFMRP reforms will also require technical inputs and targeted \non-the-job support to equip the key Government agencies with the required knowledge and \nskills to ensure that the results of the reforms will be sustained beyond PFM, and that reform \ntriggers  under  subprogram  2  and  milestones  are  achieved.  The  institutional  and  capacity \nbuilding  project  has  been  designed  to  support  PFM  reforms  over  the  medium-term.  The \nsequencing of the project activities will be coordinated with the platform approach of the PFMRP, \nand will provide for appropriate sequencing, required synchronization, and desired flexibility to \nensure success. Building on the capacity development recommendations made under earlier \nADB TA support, the proposed project will complement the capacity development action plan of \nthe EFI, and the efforts of core advisors and consultants under PFMRP in strengthening PFM \nreform  measures  in  MAFF,  MRD,  and  MOWRAM.2  In  addition,  the  project  objectives  will \ncomplement the proposed public policy training program 2007\u20132010 under the ongoing ADB \nRETA financed by the Japan Fund for Public Policy Training.  \n \n73.  The  project  will  be  the  key  instrument  supporting  rollout  of  PFM  reforms  in  rural \ndevelopment ministries and will have four components to support PFM reforms in the medium-\nterm. Appendix 7 details the project components and outputs. One of the project components \nwill  support  rural  development  ministries  (MAFF,  MRD,  and  MOWRAM)  to  implement  and \nmonitor key reforms to PFM with the focus on enhancing budget planning, budget execution \nincluding procurement, accounting, recording and reporting. Another major component will be to \nstrengthen internal audit in these ministries as a useful management tool to improve financial \ncontrols and procedures. Strengthening public debt management in the Government will also be \na critical area of support, following up the progress achieved from the recently concluded ADB \nTA on debt management. In addition, NAA will be supported to improve its audit capacity as it \nhas a fundamental role in improving the quality of financial governance, reinforcing institutional \noversight and providing critical checks and balances in the management of public finances. \nImplementation of PFM reforms under subprogram 2 will also require technical inputs and \ntargeted on-the-job support to equip the key Government agencies with the knowledge and \nskills to ensure that the results of the reforms will be sustained beyond PFM, and that reform \ntriggers under subprogram 2 and milestones are achieved. Types of assistance common to all \ncomponents will be in form of inputs such as: (i) engagement of international and national \nconsultants with relevant competencies in core PFM areas; (ii) peripatetic visits by experts and \nlong-term mentor support; (iii) seminars, conferences, and study tours; (iv) formal training and \nother workshops; and (v) provisions of materials and equipment, including IT database systems \nand computer hardware and software. \n \n ", "    29 \nB.  Cost Estimates \n74.  The project is estimated to cost $4.54 million equivalent including estimated taxes and \nduties  of  $25,000.  The  cost  estimates  are  summarized  in  Table  5  below  and  detailed  in \nAppendix 7.  \n \nTable 5: Summary of Cost Estimates \n($\u2019000) \nComponent    Total Cost \nA.

Project Implementation Arrangements \n76.  Project Management. MEF, as the EA for components 1, 2, and 3, will be responsible \nfor the overall coordination of activities under these components and will carry out Project \nadministrative  and  fiduciary  support,  and  meet  the  Government\u2019s    and  ADB\u2019s  reporting \nrequirements on the progress and use of the Project funds. The PFM Steering Committee \nSecretariat,  including  the  Director  of  MEF\u2019s  Internal  Audit  Department,  (responsible  for \ncomponent  2  activities);  the  Director,  MEF\u2019s  Department  of  Investment  and  Cooperation \n(responsible for Component 3 activities), as well as relevant operational staff shall act as the \n ", "30   \nProject Management Unit (PMU). MAFF, MRD, and MOWRAM shall be the IAs.  The PFM \nReform Working Group and any additional necessary counterpart staff within each of the IAs \nshall act as the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) for the respective activities with the Director of \nthe relevant IA\u2019s Department of Internal Audit, responsible for Component 2 activities. NAA shall \nbe the EA for Component 4 and the NAA\u2019s PMU comprising a senior staff member as the head \nand relevant counterpart staff shall implement Component 4.The PSC for PFM shall also act as \nthe Project steering committee to oversee the Project and provide overall direction and policy \nguidance. Further, the financial management and fiduciary arrangements in MEF, MAFF, MRD, \nand MOWRAM, based on assessment of the project preparatory TA, is deemed satisfactory for \nthe purpose of project implementation. \n \n77.  Period of Implementation. The project will be implemented over a period of 3 years. \nProject activities are scheduled to commence in April 2009 and be completed by March 2012. \nThe project implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 9. \n \n78.  Consulting Services and Procurement. The grant assistance will finance a team of 8 \ninternational (86 person-months) and 15 national consultants (213 person-months) to build \ncapacity while helping to implement the ongoing PFM reform measures. The terms of reference \nfor the consulting services and their duration are in Supplementary Appendix A. The consultants, \nincluding the team leader, will be selected by ADB through a consulting firm(s) (including joint \nproposal  with  domestic  firms)  through  full  technical  (for  component  1)  and  simplified  (for \ncomponent 3) proposals using quality and cost ratio for Quality- and Cost-Based Selection \n(QCBS) process (80:20) for components relating to strengthening PFM for rural development \nand  for  strengthening  debt  management.  One  international  consultant  and  one  national \nconsultant for component 2 (internal audit) and one international consultant and one national \nconsultant for component 4 (external audit) will also be selected by ADB following consultation \nwith the Government, on an individual basis, as the distinct areas of expertise involved may not \nbe available through a single firm. At the request of, and on behalf of the Government, the \nconsultants will be selected by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007 as amended from time to time) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. As the \nproposed project deals with MEF and three line ministries of which three have overlapping and \nsupporting functions in rural development, the Government feels that ADB administration of the \nproject would ensure PFM priorities and reforms are effectively synchronized across agencies. \n \n79.  To support the design and implementation of the Government\u2019s portfolio management \ndatabase, project component 3 supporting debt management will finance an IT system that will \nallow  MEF  to  record  and  provide  project-specific  information,  including  disbursement  and \ncontract awards of both development partner- and Government-funded projects. The functional \nspecifications  of  the  system  will  be  designed,  including  specifying  hardware  and  software \nsystem requirements, for commissioning and implementation by a team of IT national experts \nworking  under  the  supervision  of  international  consultants.  Information  and  communication \ntechnology (IT), related equipment and two vehicles (for NAA and the Department of Internal \nAudit for audit-related travel to inaccessible provinces) will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \n80.  Disbursement Arrangements. The ADB grant proceeds will be disbursed according to \nthe procedures in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \nTo speed up project implementation through the timely release of grant proceeds for eligible \nexpenditures, each of the Project Executing Agencies will establish a project imprest account in \ndollars at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. The imprest accounts will be managed and \nadministered by the MEF and NAA respectively. The maximum amount to be deposited to each \n ", "    31 \nof the project imprest accounts will be based on the estimated expenditures to be financed from \nthe project imprest account for the first six months of project implementation, or 5% of the Grant \namount whichever is lower. In addition, MAFF, MRD, and MOWRAM will each establish Second \nGeneration Imprest Accounts (SGIAs) at the commercial bank, or branch thereof, where the \nMEF project imprest account is to be established. The maximum amount to be deposited into \neach SGIAs shall be equivalent to 6 months\u2019 estimated expenditures to be funded from SGIA \nbut in any event not exceeding the amount of $5,000.The project imprest accounts and each of \nthe SGIAs will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements as agreed between the Government \nand  ADB.  The  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedure  may  be  used  when  seeking \nreimbursement of eligible expenditures and liquidating advances made into the project imprest \naccounts. Each payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under the SOE will not exceed the \nequivalent of $10,000. SGIA will be liquidated and replenished based on submission of full \nsupporting documentation. \n \n81.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting. MEF and NAA, assisted by the team leader of \neach project component, will maintain separate project accounts and financial statements, in \naccordance with the provisions of the Grant Agreement and ADB guidelines (Guidelines for the \nFinancial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB, 2002) and \nwill have them audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. During project \nimplementation, within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year, MEF and NAA will submit to \nADB certified copies of the annual audited project accounts and financial statements, as well as \nthe auditor\u2019s report, which will include a separate opinion on the use of the imprest account and \nstatement of expenditures procedures, and management letter, all in English. MEF and NAA will \nsubmit  semiannual  and  annual  reports  to  ADB,  indicating  progress  made,  problems \nencountered, and steps taken to remedy the problems, a program of activities, and expected \nprogress during the implementation period. The reports will incorporate the project performance \nmonitoring data and all relevant financial data. MEF and NAA will also provide reports and \ninformation relating to the Project as ADB may reasonable request. Within 3 months after \nproject completion, MEF and NAA will submit to ADB a project completion report detailing \ninformation on project implementation, and accomplishment of the project activities. \n \n82.  Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Reporting. The Government and ADB will \nundertake  joint  reviews  of  the  Project  every  6  months  to  assess  progress  in  component \nactivities, the quality of activities and the outputs produced, the performance of the project, and \nidentify issues and challenges. MEF, NAA, and ADB will conduct a midterm review covering a \ncomprehensive  assessment  of  achievements  against  the  Project\u2019s  expected  impact  and \noutcomes,  and  the  modification  of  implementation  arrangements  where  necessary  for  the \nsuccessful completion of the Project.  \n \nVII.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits \n \n83.  The program is expected to yield significant benefits as effective PFM systems are \ncrucial for Cambodia in making progress in reducing poverty. Sound PFM leads to affordable \nand  optimal  resource  allocation  and  improves  institutional  arrangements  and  management \npractices to support effective delivery of services. The program will likewise foster greater \naccountability and efficiency in the management of public resources and delivery of services, \nwhich are critical to the achievement of public policy objectives and the MDGs. Strengthening \ninstitutions like the NAA will improve fiduciary oversight. \n ", "32   \n \n84.  Economic and Financial Benefits. ADB estimates the main direct economic benefit in \nthe near term will be the cost saving for the Government in terms of procuring consultants and \nproviding  materials and equipment, including IT database systems and computers\u2014hardware \nand software. Government contracts face significantly higher than market prices as supplies \nbuild into the contract price the cost of delayed payment, time costs in terms of efforts made in \ndealing  with  cumbersome  processes  and  procedures  and  some  level  of  uncertainty  over \npossible forfeiture of payment (a risk payment). The benefit quantified to the Government of the \nADB project is therefore between $615,000 and $820,000 for 2009. 35 Procurement of all the \ninputs for the project will take place in 2009; benefits to the Government are in the form of a \none-off savings. \n \nB.  Impacts \n \n85.  Higher Economic and Poverty Impacts. The program is expected to have substantial \npositive economic impacts. Strong PFM systems contribute to macroeconomic stability through \nimproved  management  of  fiscal  expenditures  to  reduce  public  deficits  and  uncontrolled \nincreases  in  the  money  supply.  Strengthening  the  PFM  system  for  rural  development  will \ncontribute to better planning, management, and usage of budget resources, which will have a \npositive impact on the rural sector and employment generation. This in turn will ensure a \nbroadening of the tax base and will therefore contribute directly to increasing the fiscal space of \nthe Government. In line with the better fiscal management, resources for sector investment will \nincrease; the Program will therefore enhance the increased fiscal space for increased allocation \nfor social sector spending, especially in rural development sectors, including agriculture, rural \nwater supply, sanitation, irrigation, and rural roads. \n \nC.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n86.  Political Risks. Political governance is a key risk to the sustainability of PFM reform. \nHowever, given the strong commitment at the highest level of political leadership and the broad \nconsensus on the direction of reforms among the major political leaders, the risk that the \ntrajectory and momentum of reform will be reversed is low.  \n \n87.  Institutional  Risks. The comprehensive nature of the program will place significant \ndemands on the Government\u2019s weak institutions. In PFMRP stage 2, the envisaged capacity \ndevelopment plan is comprehensive and includes technical, organizational development, and \nmotivational and change management issues.  \n \n88.  Implementation Risks. The PFMRDP may be undermined by continued and excessive \ncentralization in decision making without adequate financial resources. Measures to strengthen \ntechnical  capacity  within  the  scope  of  the  PFMRDP  and  through  ADB  sector  investments \ninclude establishment of a subworking group proposed under PFMRDP, which will ensure \nappropriate coordination arrangements between MEF and rural development ministries. Close \nperformance monitoring will help reduce implementation delays.  \n \n91.  External Risks. The immediate impact of the financial crisis in the US and Europe, and \nthe drying up there of liquidity in the commercial paper and related money and interbank \nmarkets pose neither significant direct risks nor significant indirect risks to the Cambodian \n                                                 \n35 It is estimated that on average prices to the Government of Cambodia are between 15% and 20% higher than the \nmarket. MEF. 2005. PFM Performance Management Framework: Baseline Study. Phnom Penh. \n ", "    33 \neconomy, as Cambodian banks do not have significant exposure to borrowing from international \nbanks, and capital markets do not yet exist in Cambodia. However, the slowdown in the global \neconomy resulting from the fall in US and European growth rates has impacted Cambodia\u2019s \ngrowth rate, initially through reduced demand for Cambodian garments, which has reduced \nexport growth. Rising fuel and food prices pose a major threat and will exert pressure on budget \nresources, worsening the fiscal and macroeconomic environment. The impact of food price \nincreases  on  poverty  is  being  mitigated  through  emergency  assistance  approved  for  this \npurpose.36 In the medium to long term, continued business environment reforms, trade policy \nreforms and improvements in cross border facilitation aimed at enhancing Cambodia\u2019s external \ncompetitiveness will improve growth prospects.  \n \n90.  Overall Assessment. Given the magnitude of rural poverty in Cambodia, and the fact \nthat its growth is narrowly based on garments and tourism, suitable policies and institutions are \nneeded  to  sustain  growth  and  reduce  poverty  over  the  medium  term.  Public  financial \nmanagement reforms and private sector development reforms collectively provide a stable and \npredictable environment necessary for growth and broad-based development. Such reforms \naddress endemic governance challenges in the stewardship of scarce public resources and \nhelp  target  and  prioritize  those  resources  transparently  toward  achieving  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). \n \n \n91.  Conditions for Grant Effectiveness. The Program will become effective on meeting all \ntranche conditions, as specified in the policy matrix (Appendix 3).  \n \nVIII.  ASSURANCES \n \n92.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents. During the PFMRDP period, the \nGovernment, on the basis of supporting the PFMRDP, will: \n \n(i)  promptly  adopt  and  implement  in  a  timely  manner  the  polices  and  program \nactions  indicated  under  subprogram  1  of  the  PFMRDP  as  specified  in  the \ndevelopment policy letter (Appendix 2) including the policy matrix, and will ensure \nthat such policies and actions are sustained; \n \n(ii)  actively assist and support the PFM reform steering committee (MEF) and the \nPFM  working  groups  in  MAFF,  MRD,  and  MOWRAM  to  undertake  ongoing \nPFMRDP monitoring and evaluation by facilitating consultation with agencies and \nother key stakeholders as appropriate; \n \n(iii)  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other  stakeholders  about \nmeasures to ensure effective implementation of the PFMRDP; \n \n(iv)  give ADB the opportunity to comment on relevant studies and draft laws or \ndecrees that are likely to impact on PFMRDP objectives and implementation; and \n \n                                                 \n36 ADB. 2008.

Nonetheless, economic \ngrowth has supported national poverty reduction levels, but income inequality is on the rise. \nThe overall incidence of poverty declined from 34% to 30% over the period. \n \n3.  Cambodia\u2019s fiscal performance has been positive, but revenue mobilization levels \nremain weak. The budget deficit has declined from 5.4% to 2.0% between 2003 and 2007. \nTotal expenditure has fallen over the period as has the domestic funded share of the state \nbudget. Despite Government efforts to strengthen domestic tax collection and customs revenue, \nbudget revenue as a percentage of GDP remains low at 11.3% of GDP in 2007.

Inflation is a major concern for Cambodia\u2019s development prospects in the near \nterm; the monetary and fiscal authorities are taking action. From 6.4% at end-September \n2007, year-on-year inflation had risen to 10.8% by end-December 2007 and to 20.7% by end-\nSeptember 2008. While inflation has been largely imported through higher international prices \nof oil and food items, and exchange-rate effects, inflation has been driven also by higher \ndomestic  food  prices,  including  for  rice  (20%),  pork,  chicken,  and  fish  (30%\u201360%)  which \ntogether with transportation have a combined weight of over 43% in the revised CPI basket. \nRapidly rising commercial bank credit to the private sector (85.8% at end-August 2008 on a \nyear-on-year basis), also contributed to the boost in private domestic demand. In addition to its \nadverse macroeconomic effects, the spike in inflation risks undermining growth and slowing, or \neven reversing the trend, and progress achieved in reducing poverty over the last decade or so. \nPreliminary evidence suggests that as many as 2 million people may have slipped below the \npoverty line as a result of food price increases (in addition to the 4\u00bd million already below the \npoverty line), and that the poverty rate in the rural areas of eight provinces, mostly around the \nTonle  Sap  basin  where  most  of  the  poor  live,  has  reached  38%.  The  authorities  have \nannounced a series of measures to combat inflation and requested emergency food assistance, \nincluding from ADB, to help compensate the most severely affected vulnerable groups. The \nGovernment has been building up its stocks of deposits in the banking sector to offset liquidity \ngrowth. The Ministry of Finance has also announced a series of measures to help curb food \ninflation through special financing to increase rice stocks and production. To date there have \nnot  been  any  announced  contractionary  curbs  on  Government  expenditure.  The \nreestablishment of macroeconomic stability is crucial for Cambodia to meet its development \nobjectives. \n \n2.  Expenditure Profile \n \n5.

The Government\u2019s broad policy on allocation of expenditures to achieve growth and \ndevelopment was to increase and then stabilize social-sector spending in health and education \nat  current  levels  relative  to  GDP  and  to  increase  expenditure  on  the  economic  sectors \n(agriculture and rural infrastructure). From Table A5.2 it can be seen that expenditures on core \nGovernment activities decreased from 62% to 45% of the executed state budget between 1995 \nand 2007. Over the same period, expenditures on health increased from 4.6% to 10.51%, and \nexpenditures on education increased from 9.1% to 14.81%. Expenditures on economic services, \non the other hand, increased from 10.8% in 1995 to 16.9% in 2001, before declining to 7.3% in \n2007.  The  increased  expenditures  on  health  and  education  made  sense  following  the \nresumption of peace in the mid-1990s as the provision of adequate social services to the \npopulation with a limited resource base had to be the key priority of the Government.  \n \n7.  However, in the current social, institutional, and economic environment, if the RGC \nwants  to  sustain  its  current  growth  trajectory,  then  expenditures  on  economic  sectors \n(agriculture, transport, infrastructure, and rural development) is inadequate to meet the pressing \nneed for spending on public goods to stimulate rural-based, labor-intensive, poverty-reducing \ngrowth. Many countries in post-conflict situations have also experienced high growth rates and \npoverty reduction following the resumption of peace, and have increased expenditures on social \nactivities. However, international experience suggests that sustained growth requires large-\nscale increases in investment in the economic sectors to increase the productivity of the real \nsector. This increase in productivity will in turn reduce poverty in agriculture-based economies \nthrough job creation opportunities for the rural population in the agriculture sector. Thus, from an \neconomic perspective, the current level of spending on economic sectors is a weakness both \nthe RGC and development partners need to address. \n \n8.  Based on available data it is estimated that total expenditure for rural development \ncalculated as the sum executed by the three line ministries (MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD) was \n4.4%  of  recurrent  expenditure  in  2006.  However,  analyzing  expenditure  patterns  for  rural \ndevelopment as a sector on its own is very difficult in Cambodia and it is unlikely that this figure \nis wholly accurate. In reality, it is nearly impossible given the paucity of existing data to define \nexactly how much of the Government's and donor\u2019s resources is allocated to rural development \nto support the joint sector budgets and strategies of the three priority ministries. In the area of \nrural  development  there  are  multiple  agencies  responsible  for  broadly  similar  policy  and \nprogram areas, resulting in fragmentation and even program duplication. Rural development is \nalso  not  limited  to  the  activities  of  the  three  ministries  of  Rural  Development  (Ministry  of \nAgriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Ministry of Rural Development and Ministry of Water Resources and \nMeteorology), so suggesting a figure that only takes these ministries into account does not \nprovide an accurate picture of the real level of expenditure for rural development sector priorities. \nFinally, it is very difficult to determine expenditure patterns at the central line ministry (sector) \nlevel because parallel negotiations also take place between provincial departments under line \nministries and MEF. As incremental adjustments are made throughout the year to cover cash \ndeficits at the provincial level, the actual budget execution levels presented by the MEF for the \nsectors are likely to be inaccurate. However, increasing expenditures in productive areas will not \nlead to an optimum result in the absence of serious investment in capacity development and \nstrong support for PFM reforms in these ministries by the Government and the development \npartners. \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 5  55 \nB.  Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP) \n \n9.  The Public Financial Management Program (PFMRP) was adopted in December 2004. 2 \nThe 2003 Integrated Fiduciary Assessment and Public Expenditure Review (IFAPER) \u2014the \nmost comprehensive pre-PFM reform assessment undertaken in Cambodia\u2014focused on three \nlevels  of  public  expenditure  policy  and  management:  (i)  aggregate  fiscal  sustainability;  (ii) \nprioritization of resource allocation; and (iii) effective use of resources for service delivery within \nthe  context  of  the  public  financial  management  system,  civil  service  reform,  and \ndecentralization.3 The  IFAPER  concluded  that  it  had  become  increasingly  apparent  that \nweaknesses in PEFM not only had high costs in terms of allocative and operational efficiency in \nCambodia, but it has also created unacceptably high levels of fiduciary risk to public funds. The \nreport identified several weaknesses, including poor cash management, weak levels of budget \nexecution, and weak deficient accounting and reporting systems. Overall, Cambodia\u2019s financial \nmanagement system suffered from weak control (e.g., internal and external audit). The report \nfound that, compared to other low-income countries, the PEFM system in Cambodia was below \naverage and needed to be improved. \n \n10.  In response to the above findings, the Cambodian Government, in partnership with \ndevelopment  partners,  designed  a  platform  approach  to  reform  the  existing  PFM  system. \nPFMRP was established as a 10-year reform program. At the aggregate the Public Financial \nManagement Reform Program (PFMRP) platforms have been designed to impact two key \nvisions of the Government. First, the Government has recognized that a strong PFM system is \nvital to achieving the objectives identified in the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS). \nSecond, the PFMRP will help Cambodia achieve international best practice in PFM, as defined \nthrough the adoption of 15 characteristics of an effective PFM system (based on adaptation of \nPublic  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability  [PEFA]  PFM  performance  measurement \nframework).  The  PFMRP  adopts  a  platform  approach,  with  appropriate  sequencing.  Each \nindividual platform provides a clear basis for launching to the next platform, based on the \npremise that a certain level of PEFA competence is required to enable further progress to take \nplace  (diagram  at  page  59).  The  design  and  implementation  of  the  platform  approach  is \nconsistent with contemporary best practices for donor coordination.4 In Cambodia there are four \nplatforms. They aim to achieve the following objectives between 2005 and 2015: Platform 1 will \nintroduce a credible budget delivering predictable resources; platform 2 will ensure an improved \ninternal control environment that holds managers to account; platform 3 will improve the link \nbetween policy priorities and budget planning; and finally, platform 4 will ensure integration of \naccountability and review processes for both financial and performance management. To date, \nonly platform 1 has been rolled out (between 2005 and 2008). Platform 2 will be rolled out from \n2009 to 2011. \n \n11.  External assessment of the design of the PFMRP in Cambodia considers the PFMRP to \nbe credible. Development partners agree that the reform program has moved beyond theory \ninto  concrete  implementation;  there  are  tangible  outputs.  Major  outputs  of  stage  1  of  the \n                                                 \n2 MEF. 2004 Public Financial Management Reform Program: Strengthening Governance in Cambodia through \nEnhanced Public Financial Management.

PEFA is a partnership  between the World Bank, IMF, European \nCommission, DFID, Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the \nStrategic Partnership with Africa. \n ", "56  Appendix 5 \nprogram included (i) establishment of a revenue mobilization strategy, together with improved \nplanning  for  macroeconomic  context;  (ii)  improved  resource  flows  from  improved  revenue \ncollection  techniques  in  the  National  Treasury  (also  assisted  by  strong  economic  growth); \nimproved cash management and increased use of the banking system; (iii) incorporation of off-\nbudget revenues into the budget; (iv) implementation of a debt management function in MEF; (v) \nredesign of the chart of accounts and budget classification; (vi) initial design of a Government-\nwide  financial  management  information  system,  and  (vii)  completion  of  a  PFM  capacity \ndevelopment plan. \n12.  While much of the focus of stage 1 was on activities in MEF, line ministries also had a \nmajor role in the implementation of stage 1. The involvement of line ministries\u2014including MAFF, \nMOWRAM,  and  MRD\u2014in  stage  1  has  resulted  in  (i)  streamlining  the  commitments  and \npayments  system  (by  removing  prior  approval  from  MEF  for  salaries),  removing  ad-hoc \nprocurement  practices,  and  positioning  financial  controllers  to  selected  ministries);  (ii) \nconsolidation  of  ministries'  bank  accounts  in  the  Treasury  Single  Account  in  the  National \nTreasury to improve cash management and reduce fiduciary risks; (iii) reducing ministries\u2019 \npayment arrears  to improve their ability to meet current year expenditures, (iv) deconcentration \nof procurement by introducing new purchasing procedures, including raising the thresholds for \nline ministries to do their own procurement without prior MEF approval, (v) introduction of \ninternal audit units in line ministries, (vi) introduction of program budgeting on a pilot basis in \nseven  ministries  (including  MAFF  and  MRD,  but  not  MOWRAM),  and  (vii)  introduction  of \nstrategic budget  plans in  the  budget  preparation  process  as  a  first step  to linking  budget \nplanning to policy priorities. \n13.  While there has been significant progress with the platform 1 objective (improved budget \ncredibility), revenue out-turns are now within 5% of budget estimates. MAFF\u2019s expenditure \nexecution rate increased from 94% to 97% between 2005 and 2007, MRD\u2019s increased from \n90% to 93%, and MOWRAM\u2019s increased from 89% to 93%. Many reforms, particularly at the \nline ministry level, have had limited impact and may not be sustainable in the long term without \nreinforcement.5 For example, while 23 of 35 budget-funded agencies have established internal \naudit units, it is unclear which, if any, are producing quality audit reports. Furthermore, despite \nefforts to rationalize the number of Government bank accounts, ministries still hold a large \nnumber of accounts (about 1,800). However, the rural development ministries hold few accounts. \nDuring the PFMRP platform 1 period of 2005\u20132007, budget planning was improved through the \nintroduction of budget strategic plans that link preparation of the budget to ministries\u2019 strategic \ngoals at a number of pilot ministries, including MAFF and MRD. Further improvements in budget \nplanning  will  be  introduced  during  platform  2  by  extending  the  use  of  the  medium-term \nexpenditure framework to most budget agencies and by including all donor-funded program and \nproject funding in the state budget from 2009.  \n14.  In planning for PFMRP stage 2, MEF has recognized the need for greater involvement of \nline ministries in the program in order to (i) meet the platform 2 objective of \u201cincreased financial \naccountability\u201d, and (ii) deepen the reforms that were introduced in platform 1. There will also be \na need to commence or strengthen activities which are prerequisites for platforms 3 and 4. The \nassistance to be provided under the PFMRDP will be directed at meeting these objectives. \n15.  MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD have been brought into PFMRP implementation more \nclosely in platform 2 by including them (along with representatives of all other line ministries) on \n                                                 \n5 MEF. 2007.

Also, all line ministries will be required to prepare their own PFM \nministry action plan and a PFM capacity building plan. \n16.  Further enhancements of platform 1 activities, to be implemented between 2008 and \n2010, will include (i) further improvement of revenue policy and collection (It is expected that \nministries  such  as  MAFF,  which  have  significant  non-tax  revenues,  should  review  and \nperiodically  adjust  the  rates  of  their  fees  and  charges);  (ii)  further  improvements  in  debt \nmanagement, including developing a debt-management strategy and legislation, and enhanced \nuse of the debt-management database; (iii) further improvements in cash management and \nexpanded  use  of  the  banking  system  for  Government  transactions;  and  (iv)  further \nimprovements  in  public  procurement,  including  implementation  of  procurement  rules  and \nregulations  and  standard  bidding  documents,  MEF  ex-post  monitoring  of  ministries\u2019 \nprocurements, and greater transparency of bidding opportunities. (All ministries will be required \nto participate in the further procurement reforms.)  \n17.  Other stage 2 activities in which MAFF, MOWRAM, and MRD will participate are (i) \nimproving accountability by defining appropriate financial responsibilities between management \nlevels in ministries (and between levels of Government); (ii) implementing the new economic \nand administrative classifications in the chart of accounts and budget classification by 2009 and \nthe new functional classification by 2010; (iii) improved and more frequent budget reporting; (iv) \nfurther deepening of the internal audit procedures introduced in platform 1, including MEF \nquality control of internal audit reports; and (v) implementation of new financial arrangements at \nthe subnational level pursuant to the deconcentration and devolution organic law passed in \n2008. \n18.  Further  work  will  be  undertaken  in  preparation  of  activities  that  are  to  be  fully \nimplemented in platforms 3 and 4 from 2011 to 2015. MRD and MAFF as pilot ministries for \nprogram budgeting will be required to review and amend their program structures and budgeting \nprocedures in light of lessons learned in platform 1. All ministries will be required to bring donor-\nfunded programs and projects into their budget preparation cycle to the greatest extent possible.  \n19.  The PFMRP recognizes capacity building as the most important element for sustained \nsupport. A major focus of platform 2 will be capacity building in line ministries under the PFM \ncapacity development plan prepared by the Economics and Finance Institute of MEF in 2007, \nand approved by the Government as the blueprint for PFM capacity building until 2010. The \nplan provides for (i) extensive (up to 8,000 participants across the public sector) training in 33 \ndifferent PFM technical skills; (ii) broader skills development training (leadership, management); \nand  (iii)  new  human  resources  policies  (accelerated  advancement,  job  rotation,  overseas \nscholarships, and study tours). It is also proposed that the merit-based pay initiative be available \nto all line ministries to extend incentives to staff to improve their performance and to participate \nin the PFMRP. The capacity development proposed under PFMRDP will have synergy with the \nPFM capacity development plan of EFI.  \n20.  Country ownership has been the most significant feature of the PFMRP and the reform \nprocess  represents  a  number  of  sound  aid  management  practices,  including  common \npartnership principles, around a sector-wide approach that maximizes donor collaboration and \noptimizes transaction costs.  \n \n ", "58  Appendix 5 \nC.  Decentralization \n21.  The Government is pursuing a comprehensive program to reform the structure of roles \nand  responsibilities  for  subnational  administration  and  to  institute  appropriate  fiscal \narrangements for subnational levels. The program forms part of the good governance strategy \nof the National Strategic Development Plan 2006\u20132010. \n22.  It is particularly important for efficient service delivery to the rural sector that appropriate \nlocal administrative arrangements are put in place. Currently, the proportions of MRD, MAFF, \nand  MOWRAM  staff  that  are  situated  in  provincial  departments  are  72%,  66%,  and  51% \nrespectively.  However,  significant  administrative  problems  have  been  found  to  exist  at \nsubnational levels.6 These include (i) budget execution rates are too low, (ii) shares of spending \n(relative to central offices) are too low, (iii) insufficient numbers of civil servants (despite the high \nproportions noted above), and (iv) weak institutional capacity at provincial and lower levels. It \nwas also found that central offices of line ministries have little control of local budget planning, \npreparation, and execution (which are largely linked to governors\u2019 offices and provincial finance \ndepartments). This makes it extremely difficult to implement national policy mandates through \nthe budget system.  \n23.  In March 2008 an organic law on subnational administration was passed by the National \nAssembly.  The  law  establishes  a  framework  for  (i)  instituting  three  levels  of  subnational \nadministration (provinces, municipalities or districts, and sangkats or communes) with elected or \nappointed councils (communes and sangkats are to be administered under the existing Law on \nthe  Administrative  Management  of  Communes  and  Sangkats  except  for  some  specific \nprovisions in the organic law); (ii) appointing boards of governors to act as both chief executives \nof the councils and supervisors of the provincial departments of national ministries; (iii) enabling \ncouncils to appoint their own staff, including an administration director and chief of finance; (iv) \nenabling councils to be responsible for their own financial administration, but with budgets to be \napproved by the governors and MEF, and (v) establishing a National Committee on Devolution \nand Deconcentration (NCDD) within the Ministry of Interior to review ministries\u2019 functions and to \ndetermine which functions are to be assigned or delegated to subnational levels. \n24.  A draft law on subnational finance has been drafted by MEF. This draft law proposes \nthat council revenue sources include local taxes, fees and charges, and voluntary contributions. \nThe law also proposes that revenue will be provided to councils from national sources and will \ninclude (i) shared revenues, (ii) conditional and unconditional grants, and (iii) agency fees for \nservices supplied on behalf of national agencies. A high-level interministerial working group has \nbeen  tasked  with  preparing  implementation  arrangements  for  the  D&D  organic  law.  it  is \nestimated that 32 new laws and decrees are required to implement the provisions of the D&D \nlaw). \n28.  The organic law provides a strong framework but leaves the detail of implementation to a \nlarge number (32) of further laws, decrees and sub-decrees. A high level officials\u2019 group with \nrepresentation from most ministries is developing options for assigned or delegated roles and \nresponsibilities, appropriate fiscal arrangements and other implementation issues. It is expected \nthat the officials\u2019 group will continue until late 2008 or early 2009.

Assessment of National Audit Authority \n \n1.  Background \n \n25.  The sector analysis provides a summary assessment of the National Audit Authority \n(NAA) and analyses the areas for institutional and capacity development. \n \n26.  The National Audit Authority (NAA) in Cambodia has a critical role to play in improving \nfinancial  governance  and  accountability  in  the  public  sector.  NAA  is  a  key  player  in \nstrengthening the quality of financial governance, accountability and transparency, providing \nindependent institutional oversight and critical checks and balances in the management of \npublic finances. As the supreme audit institution in Cambodia, the NAA forms a vital link in the \nchain of accountability. An effectively functioning NAA can be a powerful force to combat \nfinancial malfeasance and a potent deterrent to waste and misuse of public funds.  \n \n27.  Overall,  the  assessment  is  that  further  capacity  development  is  essential  to \nstrengthening auditing methodology, auditing procedures, broader coverage, audit planning, \n ", "60  Appendix 5 \nand  audit  reporting.  Low  capacity  constrains  completion  of  planned  audits  and  results  in \nexcessive  delays.  Audit  reports  are  not  yet  published  regularly,  and  the  processes  for \nparliamentary and senate oversight of the NAA have not been clearly established. In view of this, \nthere  is  a  real  risk  that  NAA  may  not  be  able  to  reach  the  level  of  proficiency  and \nprofessionalism expected of a supreme audit institution (SAI) in the near future.  Under these \ncircumstances, achievement of the development goals of NSDP will be elusive without an \nimproved audit system. For the SAI to perform effectively, its institutional capabilities must be \nsound. SAI's mandate, resources, and human capacity should be sufficient to undertake its \nexpected tasks, and independence from the executive should be guaranteed. ADB is aware \nthat institutional strengthening and capacity building in NAA is a gradual process, and that NAA \nshould be assisted in developing audit capacity in a multiyear horizon. Emphasis should be \ninitially on financial and compliance audits, gradually moving to performance audits. \n \n2.  Audit Peer Review \n \n28.  ADB will specifically encourage and assist an audit peer review (APR) of NAA, to be \nundertaken by an independent SAI in 2009\u20132010, that will establish a clear baseline from which \nthe roadmap for long-term capacity development can be implemented. An international external \npeer review process involves a  team of external counterparts evaluating the SAI\u2019s working \npractices, comparing them with best international practice. The fact that the peer review will be \ncarried out by an independent SAI will add credibility to the process and ensure that it has the \nfull acceptance of all stakeholders. NAA\u2019s commitment to improving its operations and quest to \ndeliver high quality auditing services is further reinforced by NAA agreeing to have this review \ncarried out. NAA is aware that its image and reputation as an effective SAI is of paramount \nimportance and realizes that the technical assistance support of its development partners is vital \nfor its success.  \n \n3.  Audit Law and Assisting NAA in Drafting of Audit Subdecrees \n \n29.  All of the essential features of a sound and independent law are reflected in the 2000 \nAudit Law that established the NAA. The law requires the auditor general to report directly to the \nnational assembly and senate; the appointment of the auditor general requires a 51% majority \nof the national assembly; the auditor general has the authority to determine the salaries of NAA \naudit staff; the law extends the powers of the auditor general to conduct audits of not only all \nGovernment agencies, provinces, ministries, state enterprises, and public authorities but also \nprivate enterprises and NGO\u2019s that receive tax concessions from the Government, suppliers of \ngoods and services to the Government under contracts and expenditures on loan projects; the \nrank of the auditor general is equivalent to that of a senior minister; NAA has its own separate \nfinancial budget; NAA is empowered to conduct financial, performance, and compliance audits; \nthe appointments of the auditor general and deputy auditor generals are restricted to two terms \nof 5 years each; reports issued by the auditor general are deemed to be public documents. \n \n30.  However, there are areas where audit law can be improved and strengthened. These \nrelate to strengthening the independence of NAA, and establishing interfaces between the NAA \nand other Government agencies that form a link in the chain of accountability. A new audit \nsubdecree will be required to clarify NAA\u2019s mandate to address these shortcomings. ADB will \nassist  in  the  drafting  of  the  implementing  subdecrees  under  the  audit  law  of  2000.  The \nsubdecree will need to look into the following: deadlines for preparation and submission of the \naudited financial statements and budget settlement accounts to the national assembly; NAA\u2019s \nrole  in  the  context  of  ongoing  reforms  in  financial  management  decentralization  and \ndeconcentration; the relationship between the NAA and the Commission of Finance, Banking \n ", "  Appendix 5  61 \nand Audit (CFBA) of parliament and the senate; a more objective and transparent process for \nidentifying suitable candidates for the position of auditor general and deputy auditor general; \nstrengthening article 19 of the law relating to holding positions in any political party; the process \nfor  tabling  and  publishing  audit  reports;  the  provisions  of  the  law  relating  to  restriction  of \ndisclosure of information contrary to public interest; the process of selecting an independent \nauditor; and the interface between internal audit and the NAA. The subdecree will serve as a \nbasis to clarifying definition of the processes, procedures, and organizational interfaces for NAA; \nstrengthening the independence of the NAA; and improving communication between the various \nexternal agencies and the institutions the NAA deals with. \n \n4.  Improved Interface between Internal Audit and NAA \n \n31.  Member countries of International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) \nhave underscored the key role supreme audit institutions play in (i) establishing internal control \nstandards, (ii) creating a solid internal control framework, (iii) working with internal auditors, and (iv) \nevaluating internal controls as an integral part of both their financial and performance audits.7 In \nCambodia, a key and unique feature of the audit law is the requirement that each ministry, state-\nowned  enterprise,  and  Government  agency  establishes  an  internal  audit  department  and \nsubmits copies of all internal audit reports to the NAA. An internal audit subdecree was issued \non 15 February 2005, and since then 24 ministries have established internal audit offices. \nHowever, no effective interaction and knowledge sharing takes place between the internal audit \noffices and NAA.  \n \n5.  Audit of Externally Aided Projects \n \n32.  It is necessary to strengthen NAA's capacity to effectively audit donor-financed projects \nto ensure effective project implementation and minimize fiduciary risks. To date only four loan \nproject  audits  have  been  undertaken  of  the  37  ADB,  26  World  Bank, 33 bilateral,  five \nOrganization of Petroleum Export Countries (OPEC), and four International Fund for Agriculture \nDevelopment (IFAD)-funded projects. Significant funds are being expended on these projects, \nwhich have not been subject to adequate audit coverage because of a lack of capacity. The \nnature  of  these  projects  makes  them  vulnerable  to  procurement  irregularities  and  financial \nmismanagement. The slow pace of project implementation continues to be an issue for the \nmajority  of  ADB-  and  World  Bank-funded  projects.  Poor  project  preparation;  insufficient \nadvanced actions; slow start-up; delays in procurement; lack of competency in applying project \nmanagement, procurement, and contract management principles; and delays in and recruitment \nof  unsuitable  consultants  and  project  staff  continue  to  hamper  the  effectiveness  of  major \nprograms and projects. Despite a new subdecree issued on 26 February 2007 to comply with \nStandard  Operating  Procedures  (SOPs),  the  Procurement  Manual  (PM),  and  the  Financial \nManagement Manual (FMM), compliance is not satisfactory because of a lack of experience and \ntechnical capability. There is therefore an urgent need to assist NAA to build capacity in this area \nand to undertake effective auditing of these projects, thus adding value both to the donors and to \nthe Government\u2019s objectives for development and capital infrastructure spending.  \n                                                 \n7  INTOSAI's general and detailed standards are reiterated in chapters II and III. To help achieve control objectives and \nan orderly and effective internal control structure, INTOSAI's internal control guidelines provide detailed standards \ncovering (i) documentation, (ii) prompt and proper recording of transactions and events, (iii) authorization and \nexecution of transactions and events, (iv) separation of duties, (v) supervision, and (v) access to and accountability for \nresources and records. \n ", "62  Appendix 6   \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title: Cambodia/Public Financial Management for Rural Development \n \nLending/Financing  Project/Sector/Multitranche Financing Facility/  Southeast Asia Department/ \nDepartment/ \nModality:  ADF  Policy-Based, Others (please specify)  Governance,  Finance,  and  Trade \nDivision: \nGrant  Program Grant  Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n \nCambodia\u2019s high income poverty and non-inclusive growth makes it one of the poorest countries of the world, resulting in \ninequalities that are deep-seated and most pronounced in the urban\u2013rural divide. The upside is that according to the 2004 \nNational Socio-Economic Survey and a number of specially commissioned studies, there has been a steady decline in poverty \nin Cambodia since the end of the civil war. The percentage of Cambodians living below the poverty line fell from an estimated \n47% in 1994 to about 35% in 2004 (source: Asian Development Bank, 2007, Country Strategy and Program Midterm Review, \nCambodia 2005\u20132009).a However, over the same period Cambodia has witnessed a sharp rise in income inequality, and an \nincreasing gap between the rich and the poor. Despite a marked decline in the poverty level during the period 1994\u20132004, a \nWorld Bank poverty assessment in 2006 (Cambodia: Halving Poverty by 2015)b highlighted the growing incidence of rural \npoverty. The rise in consumption inequality has been attributed to the uneven spread of economic growth across Cambodia, \naccording to the World Bank report Sharing Growth: Equity and Development in Cambodia (2007)c. Cambodia lags behind \nmany developing countries on several human development indexes due in part to limited access to roads, markets, and basic \nservices by rural residents (which comprise 90% of Cambodia\u2019s poor). Cambodia faces daunting challenges in its efforts to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is ranked 129th out of 177 countries in the United Nations (UN) \nHuman Development Report (2006). The human poverty index, which looks beyond income deprivation, similarly ranks \nCambodia 73rd among 102 developing countries. This signifies that the country is probably not on track in many critical areas \nof food security, poverty reduction, and sustainable social and economic development. There is a need for fundamental \ninstitutional and policy changes if the country is to achieve the goal of halving poverty by 2015. Given these socioeconomic \nindicators, the Government of Cambodia continues to list rural development and improving the lives of the rural poor as its top \npriorities. The Government launched the Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP) in December 2004. This \nProgram aims to establish a strong public financial management (PFM) system that will facilitate the implementation of the \nNational Poverty Reduction Strategy. \n \nContribution of the Sector or Subsector to Poverty Reduction in Cambodia. PFM reforms help reduce poverty by \nenhancing the effectiveness of public expenditures and improving public spending efficiency and accountability. Robust PFM \nmechanisms improve allocative efficiency and the investment climate. PFM's impact on economic growth is significant, as \ngood PFM practices promote pro-poor growth by directing public expenditures to the rural development sector. Identifying \npoverty-reducing spending in the budget and providing commensurate resources require appropriate policies and institutions. \nThe national budget is therefore the principal vehicle for efficient resource management. To make a dent, an efficient and \nfunctional financial management system should raise, allocate, and spend adequate resources for programs that strengthen \nthe human capital of the poor, provide for their physical security, and ensure adequate public infrastructure to facilitate \neconomic growth\u2014and hence reduce poverty. \n \nPFM and Rural Development. Implementation of poverty reduction measures requires a realistic budget and adequate \nallocation of resources. The National Strategic Development Plan regards rural development as a major crosscutting issue, \ncovering health, education, agriculture, water, sanitation, etc. Promotion of economic growth policies, leading to increased per \ncapita income of the rural household (who are proportionally poorer than urban dwellers in Cambodia) will be realized by \novercoming binding constraints in these sectors. Improvements in the operational efficiency and effectiveness of ministries \ndealing with rural development will lead to timely and predictable release of funds to all targeted beneficiaries. This in turn will \ndirectly support the effectiveness of reforms aimed at improving rural growth prospects. For example, budget execution rates \nfor pro-poor sectors will increase, as will the value for money of spending for scarce resources. At the same time, strong PFM \nsystems strengthen accountability of service providers to targeted beneficiaries by rationalizing expenditure policy, and \nenhance financial accountability by reducing fiduciary risks to public funds. As such, reform of PFM is key to reducing rural \npoverty and for promoting more equitable growth trajectories in Cambodia. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                 Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nAll elements of the PFMRDP are concerned with strengthening the national PFM system and, as suggested above, reform \nmeasures supported by this Program do not have a direct impact on poverty. Public financial management reforms contribute \nindirectly to poverty reduction. Specifically, they improve the effectiveness of service delivery in rural development and ", "Appendix 6  63 \nimprove expenditure management and control mechanisms, thereby contributing to the Government\u2019s strategy for enhancing \ngrowth, generating employment, and reducing poverty. Therefore, no direct social impacts are expected from the program. On \nthe other hand, indirect social impacts are significant, manifested in improvements in the quality and quantity of public \nservices and improved governance resulting from more transparent and accountable management of public resources. \nTherefore, no adverse impacts requiring mitigating measures have been identified. In light of this, no specific poverty analysis \nis required or appropriate for s system-development investment of this type. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n \nC. Social Issues \n \nThere is no foreseen social risk associated with the Program. Indirect social impacts include: improvement in the quality and \nquantity of public services and improved governance through more transparent, predictable, and accountable management of \npublic resources. The Program has been assigned category C in terms of impact on indigenous people. \n \nD.   Environmental Aspects \n \nNo environmental issues or concerns that result from the activities under this Program. \n \nE.  Consultation and Participation \n \n While formal stakeholder analysis or a participation strategy was not produced as a discrete output, the scope of the Program \nwas conceptualized and formulated based on extensive formal and informal stakeholder consultations. However, as a part of \nthe processing for the grant support, extensive consultations were held with a wide range of stakeholders, including central \nministries and development partners. \n \nF.  Gender and Development \n \nThe envisaged program design indicates that there will be no negative impact on women. The PFM outcome will promote \ninclusive growth, and  will identify gender-responsive policy changes, based on assessment and feedback during the \nimplementation process. \n \nIII.
