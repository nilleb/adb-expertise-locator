I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation for the proposed \npolicy-based  loan  to  the  Republic  of Indonesia for  the  Financial  Market  Development  and \nIntegration Program.1  \n \n2.  The  program  will  be  the  culmination  of  a  long-standing  engagement  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) with Bapepam-LK, which will be the program\u2019s executing agency. The \nprogram will support the combination of Bapepam-LK, the supervisory agency of the country\u2019s \ncapital markets and nonbank financial institutions, and the bank supervision division of Bank \nIndonesia (BI), into a unified, independent financial sector regulator. Because Bapepam-LK will \nno longer be able to serve as executing agency for ADB programs or technical assistance (TA) \nafter 1 January 2013, the program will also expand ADB\u2019s engagement in support of broader \nfinancial  sector  development  with  the  government\u2019s  Fiscal  Policy  Office  (FPO),  which  will \nsucceed Bapepam-LK as executing agency. The program is fully consistent with and supports \nthe  government\u2019s  medium-term  reform  priorities  set  out  by  the  National  Medium-Term \nDevelopment  Plan  2010\u20132014  (NMTDP)  which  is  being  implemented  through  the  Capital \nMarket and Nonbank Financial Industry Master Plan (CMNMP) for 2010\u20132014. These reform \npriorities have been incorporated into the first strategic pillar of  ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy for Indonesia for 2012\u20132014, which is inclusive growth. The program and proposed \ncapacity development TA2 which is being processed to support it are included in the country \noperations business plan for 2010\u20132012. The program is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Financial \nSector Operational Plan because it will improve access to capital markets, increase financial \nstability and integrity, and foster regional cooperation and integration.3 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Encouraging  progress  to  date.  ADB  has  successfully  supported  financial  sector \ndevelopment  in  Indonesia  since  1988.  Over  the  first  ten  years  of  the  engagement,  ADB \nprograms helped develop the sector\u2019s basic legal, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks while \nencouraging competition between financial institutions. During the 1997\u20131998 Asian Financial \nCrisis, ADB supported bank restructuring to restore financial sector health and initiated efforts to \nstrengthen financial sector supervision. In addition to providing capacity building, ADB sought to \nreduce regulatory arbitrage by supporting the merger of the capital market regulator and the \nnonbank financial sector regulator, which led to the formation of Bapepam-LK. ADB\u2019s more \nrecent  initiatives,  covering  the  period  2002\u20132009,  have  promoted  deeper  and  more  liquid \nfinancial markets, strengthened market surveillance and investor protections, and have helped \nsteadily  build  capacity.  A  primary  dealer  system  was  established  and  the  country\u2019s  stock \nexchanges were merged and placed under professional management. Governance of mutual \nfunds was strengthened and price discovery and transparency were enhanced at the same time \nby the creation of an independent bond pricing agency. Initiatives were undertaken to develop \nan  independent  anti-money  laundering  capability  in  the  Financial  Transaction  Reports  and \nAnalysis Center, which was followed by the development of anti-money laundering protocols \nwithin Bapepam-LK. Training budgets were increased and independent training centers were \nestablished through partnerships between Bapepam-LK and the private sector. The CMNMP \nitself, which will focus and coordinate the efforts of stakeholders as Indonesia continues to \n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 This TA is being processed separately and the funding source is yet to be determined. \n3 ADB. 2011. Financial Sector Operational Plan. Manila. ", "2 \ndevelop and expand its nonbank financial sector, was initiated under ADB\u2019s Capital Markets \nDevelopment Program Cluster and was drafted with TA provided by ADB. 4  \n \n4.  The impact of ADB-sponsored reforms is reflected in the improving fundamentals of the \ncountry\u2019s capital markets. The Directorate General of Debt Management (DGDM) of the Ministry \nof Finance now issues an annual schedule of auctions and reopens issues instead of issuing \nnew series of government securities. As a result, the sum of amount traded for five recognized \nbenchmark issues increased by a factor of 25 during 2007\u20132011. The DGDM has smoothed out \nthe government\u2019s debt profile through debt swaps and buybacks. Because of this, Indonesia \nnow has the most long-dated maturity structure of any government bond market in emerging \nEast Asia with around 40% of its government bonds issued with tenors greater than 10 years.5 \nPrudent fiscal management and sound debt management led to an upgrade of Indonesia\u2019s \ncredit rating in 2011 to investment grade. The upgrade provided additional support to the local \nbond market as the volume of corporate issues doubled in 2010 over 2009. Bond market returns \nwere also impressive, with Indonesia outperforming its peers with a return of 24%. These trends \ncontinued into 2011 when Indonesia registered year-on-year growth in corporate issuance of \n28%, the fastest in Southeast Asia. 6 Indonesian bonds also outperformed their Southeast Asian \nregional peers for the second consecutive year, yielding a return of 20% on an unhedged local \ncurrency basis.  \n \n5.  The pension and insurance subsectors have also exhibited promising trends with total \naggregate assets increasing from Rp192 trillion in 2006 to Rp618 trillion in 2011. During this \nperiod, insurance density more than doubled and the number of individuals covered by a private \npension fund increased to 2.7 million. Insurance premiums relative to gross domestic product \n(GDP) have been growing and now approximate the level of insurance penetration in Thailand. \nAs of 2011, the aggregate net asset value of the mutual fund sector exceeded Rp172 trillion, \ncompared with Rp153 trillion in 2010 and Rp114 trillion in 2009. The sukok market has also \ngrown remarkably. It has increased by an average of more than 100% every year since 2006, \nreaching Rp92 trillion in 2011. \n \n6.  The  work  done  to  strengthen  Bapepam-LK  has  improved  standards  and  made \nsupervision  of  the  financial  markets  more  effective.  CLSA  Asia-Pacific  Markets\u2019  Corporate \nGovernance  Watch  for  2010  noted  that  \u201cmarket  participants  and  regulators  are  genuinely \nbecoming  more  serious  about  enforcement\u201d.7 The  report,  which  provides  an  independent \nassessment of corporate governance practices in Asia, noted a substantial increase in the \nnumber of enforcement actions initiated by Bapepam-LK as well as strengthened disclosure for \npublic companies, including improved nonfinancial reporting standards, and more active audit \ncommittees.  \n \n7.  Achieving  Indonesia\u2019s  full  potential.  The  overarching  goal  of  the  government\u2019s \nNMTDP 2010\u20132014 is to make Indonesia a prosperous, self-reliant, and democratic country.     \nTo improve the welfare of the population through sustainable economic growth and to achieve \nthe associated goal of reducing the poverty rate to below 10%, the government has established \na cumulative investment target of Rp12,000 trillion\u2013Rp12,500 trillion during this time period. A \nsignificant proportion of this investment is targeted to come from banks, nonbank financial \n                                                \n4 ADB. 2009.

Despite progress in capital markets development, the local \ncurrency government and corporate bond markets in Indonesia represent, in the aggregate, less \nthan 15% of GDP and remain very small compared with those in regional peers Malaysia and \nThailand,  where  bond  markets  exceed  65%  of  GDP.  The  contractual  savings  sector  also \nremains small, with insurance premiums representing less than 2% of GDP. If Indonesia is to \nmeet its internal investment targets, more needs to be done to deepen the financial sector and \nto establish vibrant nonbank financial institutions.  \n \n8.  Boosting the role of the contractual savings subsector as a source of potential demand \nfor capital markets products is particularly important and needs to be encouraged. For example, \nthe interconnections between contractual savings, capital market development, and economic \ngrowth are not deeply understood by the public or even segments of the government and the \nprivate sector. The government and stakeholders in the private sector need to jointly encourage \ngrowth in long-term savings by providing tax incentives, improving the governance of the sector, \nand adopting more effective asset allocation methodologies. Other constraints on Indonesia\u2019s \ncapital markets are a lack of risk management tools, burdensome regulatory requirements, and \nlimited transparency. Low domestic investor confidence and high volatility brought about by \ndominant  levels  of  foreign  participation  have  limited  domestic  participation  in  the  capital \nmarkets. The need to address these issues and to modernize the regulatory structure has \nbecome even more urgent due to an increase in inward capital flows associated with the \ncountry\u2019s credit rating upgrade and the need for infrastructure funding.8  \n \n9.  The cost to Indonesia of limited financial sector development can be measured in terms \nof forgone economic benefits. The link between economic growth, private credit and stock \nmarket liquidity is well known and is empirically supported. Studies indicate that contractual \nsavings also play a large role in fostering economic development. 9 10  By increasing the links \nbetween  contractual  savings  and  the  other  financial  subsectors,  Indonesia\u2019s  economy  can \nbenefit from lower information and transaction costs, pooling of risk, increasing efficiency of \ncapital allocation, and enhanced intermediation. This same research indicates that the boost to \neconomic growth achieved by increasing the penetration of life insurance will be even more \npronounced given higher levels of bank credit to GDP and stock market liquidity. Using studies \nby Levine and Zervos done in 1998 and Marco Arena in 2008, and the World Bank\u2019s Financial \nDevelopment and Structure Database, ADB staff estimated that Indonesia\u2019s real GDP per capita \nwould have been $1,300 in 2010, or 14% higher than the actual $1,144, if the level of bank \ncredit intermediation had been equal to the average of the data base in each year over the \nperiod 1990\u20132010. Similarly, real GDP per capita in 2010 would have risen to $1,335, or 17% \nhigher than the actual if the level of bank credit intermediation and stock market liquidity 11 had \nbeen equal to the average of the data base in each year over the period 1990\u20132010. Finally, \ncombining an increase in bank credit intermediation and stock market liquidity with an increase \n                                                \n8    Asia Wall Street Journal. 2012.

The Levine-Zervos study estimated that an increase by one standard deviation in stock \nmarket liquidity at inception would have resulted in an 18% increase in GDP over the 18-year period of study. If \nthis was combined with a one-standard-deviation increase in bank credit to the private sector, GDP growth would \nhave been 31% higher. \n10  Marco Arena. 2008. Does Insurance Market Activity Promote Economic Growth? A Cross-Country Study for \nIndustrialized and Developing Countries. The Journal of Risk and Insurance, volume 75 (Number 4), pp. 921\u2013946. \nResearch indicates that a one-standard-deviation increase in total insurance premiums to GDP would increase \nreal  GDP  per  capita  growth  by  0.47%  with  even  greater  effects  in  countries  at  low  to  middle  levels  of \ndevelopment. \n11   Liquidity  here  is defined not by the  number of  companies  listed but  by  the ease with which the shares of listed  \n     companies are traded. \n ", "4 \nin insurance penetration during this same period would have increased real per capita GDP in \n2010 to $1,700, representing an increase of almost 50% over the actual. \n \n10.  The proposed program. The government\u2019s medium-term reform priorities focus on the \nidentified development constraints. First, the government seeks, in particular, to foster economic \ndevelopment  by  strengthening  regulatory  oversight.  This  in  turn  will  increase  stability  and \ninvestor confidence. Also, the CMNMP aims to deepen the capital market, expand access to \nnonbank  financing,  and  broaden  the  investor  base.  To  attain  these  objectives  and  build \nmomentum  for  capital  market  development,  the  CMNMP  provides  a  functional  focus  on \nincreasing the linkages between the contractual savings subsector, the subsector dealing in \nfunding arrangements that are compliant with Islamic sharia law, and the traditional capital \nmarkets. To support these reforms, the government has requested ADB assistance in the form \nof a policy-based program loan. The program will build on the government\u2019s accomplishments \nunder the post-program partnership framework (P3F) of Subprogram 2 of ADB\u2019s Capital Market \nDevelopment  Program  Cluster  (footnote  4).  Guided  by  this  program,  the  government  has \ncompleted 45 of the total 54 actions within the post-program partnership framework, including 9 \nof the 11 actions that were identified as required actions.12  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the program will be an expanded nonbank financial sector supporting \nincreased intermediation. The outcome will be increased domestic participation in the nonbank \nfinancial sector. The program\u2019s three outputs will reflect the primary objectives of the CMNMP.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  Output 1: Regulatory oversight strengthened. Indonesia\u2019s credit rating upgrade in \n2011 has led to an influx of foreign investment. This will increase the country\u2019s exposure to the \nrisk of global contagion through capital flows and exposure to sophisticated and interlinked \ninternational investment schemes. In light of this, the government has recognized the need to \ncontinue strengthening the regulatory infrastructure to ensure investors of stability and proper \ngovernance of the financial sector. Under output 1, the creation of the Integrated Financial \nServices Authority (OJK) was authorized in law in 2011 and the agency will be operational by \nthe end of 2012. This initiative will provide for independent, harmonized, and comprehensive \nregulation and supervision of the financial markets. ADB has been a consistent supporter of this \neffort since 2002.13 In addition, Bapepam-LK has further enhanced its supervisory capabilities \nand those of the successor OJK by processing the revision of three primary financial sector laws \non capital markets, insurance, and pensions to include resolution powers over problematic \ninstitutions and qualified supervisor immunity. Drafts of all three laws have been completed, \nsocialized and entered into the national legislative agenda. Bapepam-LK has introduced risk-\nbased supervisory practices to the contractual savings subsector and has continued to pursue \nregional integration initiatives that include the harmonization of standards. As part of these \nefforts, Bapepam-LK has participated in an initiative to introduce a common set of corporate \n                                                \n12 The actions not completed related primarily to reform of domestic taxation applied to financial products and \nfinancial markets in general. The Directorate General of Taxation, which is responsible for such taxes, is a peer \nagency of Bapepam-LK under the Ministry of Finance and therefore not subject to its control. Bapepam-LK has not \nbecome a signatory of Schedule A of the International Organization of Securities Commissions because this will be \npossible only after passage of the revised capital markets law. Several actions were dropped as they had become \nobsolete or responsibility for performance was transferred to another party.  \n13 ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the Financial Governance and Social Security Reform Program. Manila. \n ", "5 \ngovernance standards in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and has strengthened \ncorporate governance standards in Indonesia in line with this effort. Programs to develop the \ncapacity of the industry and financial regulators have been completed and will continue. \n \n13.  Output  2:  Deepened  capital  market  provides  expanded  access  to  nonbank \nfinancing.  To deepen the capital markets and facilitate the formation of a risk-free yield curve, \nthe government\u2019s efforts were focused on coordinated, ongoing activities to strengthen the \nprimary and secondary government debt market, including the market for sukok. The DGDM \nhas continued to consolidate government debt issuance around recognized benchmarks. To \nsupport  the  secondary  market  and  to  strengthen  the  conduct  of  monetary  policy,  Bank \nIndonesia discontinued issuance of Bank Indonesia bills, which were supplanted by Treasury \nbills beginning in 2011. Concurrently, Bank Indonesia began implementing monetary policy \nthrough open market operations with its own inventory of securities and repos/reverse repos \nwith maturities of 1 week to 6 months. This reform includes measures to increase the proportion \nof tradable securities within the government\u2019s debt stock by beginning a process through which \nnon-tradable  bank  recapitalization  bonds  will  be  converted  to  tradable  status.  To  improve \nmarket efficiency, increase trading volumes, and strengthen risk management, a draft global \nmaster  repurchase  agreement,  with  applicable  annexes,  has  been  completed  and  will  be \nintroduced into Indonesia. To provide a greater number and variety of instruments to investors, \nmeasures were implemented to ease the securities issuance process and to encourage the use \nof  municipal  bonds  by  rationalizing  existing  regulations  and  harmonizing  them  with  those \ngoverning the issuance of corporate debt. To improve the quality and transparency of financial \ninformation,  Bapepam-LK  has  continued  to  progress  towards  full  convergence  with  the \nInternational  Accounting  Standards  and  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards.  To \nstrengthen investor protections, Bapepam-LK has launched an initiative to create a securities \nmarket investor protection fund and has increased participation in the investor area facility to \nprovide  investors  with  the  ability  to  independently  self-monitor  their  investment  portfolios. \nBapepam-LK has introduced a code of conduct for market intermediaries. \n \n14.  Output  3:  Increased  mobilization  of  long-term  savings  through  a  broadened \ninvestor base.  The resilience of the capital market is also dependent on the strength and \ndepth of the domestic investor base and the accumulation of long-term savings. To capture the \nbenefits  of  coordinated  financial  market  development,  Bapepam-LK  has  simultaneously \nincreased the contractual savings sector\u2019s demand for capital market products. Specifically, \nBapepam-LK has encouraged participation in retirement planning by easing the rights issuance \nprocess, which benefits employee stock ownership plans, and by exempting investment income \nearned  by  pension  funds  from  taxation.  Bapepam-LK  has  also  provided  an  enabling \nenvironment for the growth of takaful, a form of Islamic insurance, by issuing guidelines on the \ngovernance  of  takaful  undertakings.14 Bapepam-LK  has  adopted  and  implemented  basic \nprinciples  and  standards  of  financial  soundness  for  shariah\u2013compliant  insurance  and \nreinsurance.  To  strengthen  the  conventional  insurance  industry,  Bapepam-LK  raised  the \nminimum capital standards for insurance and reinsurance companies and has worked with the \nindustry to improve pricing and risk management in the life and nonlife insurance subsectors. \nThis included collaboration to develop updated mortality tables based on Indonesian data as \nwell as minimum tariffs for auto insurance. To broaden the investor base, the government has \nencouraged the development of the Islamic finance sector by giving it the same tax treatment as \nconventional finance. Bapepam-LK revised the criteria for giving stocks sharia-compliant status. \n                                                \n14 Feyen, Lester, and Rocha. 2011. What Drives the Development of the Insurance Sector? Washington, DC:  World \nBank. This article cites empirical evidence that Sharia compliance must be assured to build the insurance sector in \nIslamic countries. \n ", "6 \nAs  a  result,  the  number  of  sharia-based  contracts  expanded  and  the  number  of  shariah-\ncompliant securities increased.  Bapepam-LK has strengthened governance in the contractual \nsavings industry and increased investor confidence by strengthening the role of pension fund \ncontrollers\u2019 committees.15 \n \nD.  Proposed Technical Assistance \n \n15.  A capacity development TA is being processed separately from the program to provide \nkey  risk  mitigation  and  to  ensure  that  reforms  continue.  The  FPO  will  be  named  as  the \nexecuting agency to reflect the next phase of ADB\u2019s engagement with the government in \nsupport of financial sector development.16 The program was not preceded by project preparation \nTA but preparatory work for the loan was supported by TA which funded activities that included \nthe development of a plan to launch of an investor protection fund and the introduction of the \nglobal master repurchase agreement17 In addition, a regional TA is supporting the introduction \nof a regional corporate governance scorecard. 18  \nE.  Medium-Term Reform Framework \n \n16.  The new board of commissioners of OJK was selected on 31 July 2012. Bapepam-LK \nwill subsequently relinquish its supervisory mandate over the nonbank financial sector on 31 \nDecember 2012. This means that Bapepam-LK will no longer be able to serve as an executing \nagency for ADB program loans or TA projects. However, ADB will ensure continuity of the \nreform agenda under the program by confirming the FPO as the successor executing agency \nand will at the same time broaden its engagement with the government. This arrangement is \nboth appropriate and timely because the FPO will assume responsibility for financial sector \nstability and for establishing and coordinating broad financial sector development strategies \nacross government agencies. This will allow ADB and the government, through FPO, to address \nselect development constraints, such as taxation, that were outside of Bapepam-LK\u2019s control \nbut will now fall under the responsibility of the FPO. \n \n17.  In recognition of this transition, the need to continue with financial sector reforms, and \nthe government\u2019s request that ADB remain engaged in the sector, ADB and the government \nhave developed a non-binding medium-term reform framework to guide the reform agenda from \n1  January  2013\u201331  December  2015.  Under  this  framework,  the  government  will  provide \ncontinuing fiscal and operational support to OJK through the start-up phase and will assist the \nFPO as it begins building the broad oversight mechanisms, such as a crisis management \nprotocol, that are necessary to assure financial sector stability. ADB will continue to support the \nFPO and other stakeholders with capacity development and technical advice as coordinated \nefforts to further develop Indonesia\u2019s financial markets continue. These efforts include capacity \ndevelopment and measures to continue deepening the primary and secondary government debt \nmarkets, encouraging Islamic finance, and supporting the introduction of hedging instruments. \n                                                \n15 The outputs to provide an enabling environment are supported by initiatives to strengthen the technical capacity of \nthe insurance and pension regulators undertaken by the World Bank and the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment. \n16 The proposed TA will provide assistance to strengthen operations in the newly created OJK to ensure that \nsupervision of the financial system is independent, harmonized, and free of political interference. The TA will also \nstrengthen the government\u2019s high-level oversight and financial sector development activities by supporting the \nemergence of the FPO as an economy-wide policy formulation and coordination body. It will also ensure the \ncontinuation of reforms undertaken under the FMDIP by providing support to select activities within the CMNMP. \n17 ADB. 2010.

The associated government expenditure plan for 2012 includes costs \nassociated  with  the  reforms  accomplished  under  the  program  that  are  estimated  very \nconservatively at $304 million. This estimate includes costs that must be absorbed by the \ngovernment  to  strengthen  the  supervisory  framework.  For  example,  the  absorption  of  the \nsupervision function of Bank Indonesia into the newly created unified regulatory will require \ncomprehensive support to ensure a smooth integration of people and cultures. The estimate \nalso  includes  information  system  upgrades  within  the  supervisory  agencies  and  the  self-\nregulatory organizations to provide for a more efficient and secure financial infrastructure. These \nupgrades have and will further increase investor confidence and reduce the costs associated \nwith financial transactions. Finally, the estimate includes a one-time lump sum estimate of \nforegone tax revenue associated with tax reforms under the program but excludes the increased \nlegal, administrative, and compliance expenses associated with strengthening the regulatory \nposture of OJK. These costs remain modest, however, when compared with the opportunity \ncosts to Indonesia of not enhancing financial sector development. \n \n19.  To support these reforms, the government has requested a loan of $300,000,000 from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of \n3 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and \nconditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. The Republic of Indonesia has provided ADB \nwith (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate-based \nlending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice \nfrom ADB. The financing plan is described in Table 1 below. \n \nTable 1: Financing Plan \nShare of \nAmount  Total  \nSource  ($ million)    (%) \nAsian Development Bank  300.00    100.00 \nTotal      300.00    100.00 \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The  implementation  period  will  be  from  1  Sept  2009  to  31  December  2012.                  \nThe executing agencies for the program will be Bapepam-LK and the FPO.  Bapepam-LK will be \nresponsible  for  carrying  out  all  policy  actions  and  will  remain  executing  agency  through             \n31  December  2012.  The  FPO  will  assume  sole  responsibility  as  executing  agency  on                 \n1 January 2013. The FPO will be responsible for continuing policy dialogue and for any reforms \ninitiated under the nonbinding medium-term reform framework. The implementing agencies for \nthe program will be (i) Bapepam-LK, the DGDM, and the Directorate General of Taxation, all \nthree under the Ministry of Finance; (ii) Bank Indonesia; (iii) the Indonesian Stock Exchange;   \n(iv) the Indonesian Clearing and Guarantee Corporation; (v) the Indonesian Central Securities \nDepository;  and  (vi)  the  Indonesian  Financial  Transaction  Reports  and  Analysis  Center.         \nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.19  \n                                                \n19 ADB. 1998.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Governance \n21.  The program is exposed to the interrelated risks of corruption and weak public financial \nmanagement. These risks have been mitigated over time by the government\u2019s efforts to combat \ncorruption. The government has established targets under the NMTDP 2010\u20132014 to cut down \ncorruption and improve transparency and integrity in the management of public resources. \nConsiderable progress has been made in strengthening the legal and administrative framework \nof public financial management to support the introduction of international sound practices. 20  \nSpecific reforms have been made in the areas of public procurement, auditing, monitoring, and \nevaluation. Ongoing reform efforts, including the introduction of a medium-term expenditure \nframework and performance-based budgeting, emphasize the need for improved transparency \nin  the  allocation  of  fiscal  transfers  to  the  regions.  In  addition,  the  government  has  taken \nimportant  strides  toward  efficient financial  management  by  establishing  public  procurement \noffices at national and subnational levels. Lastly, progress has been achieved in improving the \ntransparency and strengthening the role of the external audit function.  Challenges remain, \nhowever, including the need to improve internal controls in budget execution by spending \nagencies and to complete the government financial management information system, which \nprovides information for budget management at all levels of government. \n \n22.  ADB is building on this momentum by continuing to support improvements in technical \ncapacity  and  controls.  Building  on  previous  programs,  ADB  TA 21  is  helping  improve \ntransparency and efficiency in public procurement processes through institutional development, \nstrengthening the capacity and professionalism of staff, raising public awareness, and improving \nthe e-procurement system. 22 Evidence that the government measures to reduce corruption are \nhaving  some  success  can  be  found  in  Indonesia\u2019s  improving  score  on  Transparency \nInternational\u2019s Corruption Perception Index, which rose to 3.0 in 2011 from 2.8 in 2010. The \nWorld Bank\u2019s country partnership strategy with the country for 2009\u20132012 recognizes that the \ngovernment has increased the level of electoral accountability, encouraged an independent \nmedia, and provided an institutional framework to investigate and prosecute corruption. In the \ncontext of capital market development, government anticorruption efforts are evident from a \nrising number of administrative cases and actions filed and enforced by Bapepam-LK. \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Bapepam-LK  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  government\u2019s  development  policy  letter  in \nAppendix 3 and are further detailed in the policy matrix in Appendix 4. \n \n                                                \n20 Government regulation (PP) 60/2008 requires that all state institutions implement the government\u2019s internal control \nsystem. \n21 ADB. 2010.  Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Strengthening National Public Procurement \nProcesses. Manila.     \n22 The government has also proposed an investment loan for 2012 to provide training for approximately 20,000 \nauditors, and their auditees, including public procurement officials. \n ", "9 \nB.  Poverty and Social \n24.  The government incorporated the goals and objectives of its Poverty Reduction Strategy \nPaper (2005) in the NMTDP for 2004\u20132009. In turn, ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \n2006\u20132009 incorporated and supported the goals of the NMTDP, which included achieving \nhigher levels of pro-poor sustainable growth. Five areas of engagement were targeted including \ndeepening of the financial sector. This emphasis has continued into the new NMTDP for 2010\u2013\n2014 and has been incorporated into pillar 1 of the ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for 2012\u2013\n2014, which is inclusive growth.23 Under this framework, ADB  will continue supporting the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to achieve more inclusive growth through furthering the development of the \nnonbank financial sector. \n \n25.  A number of empirical studies, including one by the International Monetary Fund have \nsupported the direct relationship between financial sector development and poverty reduction. 24 \nThe link between economic growth and financial sector development as measured by private \ncredit and stock market liquidity is well known, has been empirically supported (para. 9), and \nserves as the primary basis of the government\u2019s focus on financial sector development to \nreduce poverty. However, financial sector development also improves access to finance by \nreducing information and transaction costs. This allows more entrepreneurs, especially those \nless  well-off,  to  obtain external finance.  For these  reasons,  the  poor will  benefit from  the \nprogram because a deeper and more liquid finance sector will increase access to finance at a \nlower cost through a greater number and diversity of financial providers and financial products. \nFinally, financial sector development reduces financial instability, which has been shown to have \na disproportionate impact on the poor.  \n \nC.  Safeguards \n26.  The  program  will  not  trigger  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies  and  is  categorized  C  for \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people. ADB and the government have \nagreed to incorporate the following in the legal agreement. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \ndirectly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices \nrelating to the program. The government agreed to cooperate, and shall cause any and all \ngovernment  offices,  organizations,  and  entities  involved  in  implementing  the  program  to \ncooperate fully with any such investigation and to extend all necessary assistance, including \nproviding access to all relevant books and records, as may be necessary for the satisfactory \ncompletion of any such investigation. \n \nD.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n27.  Several risks can be expected to accompany the significant structural change in the \nregulatory and policy oversight that the program supports. For example, the government may \nnot  achieve  its  medium-term  goals  for  financial  sector  development  because  the  broad \ncoordination of financial sector reforms envisioned under the FPO may be limited by a lack of \ncapacity or resources. Continuity of reforms under the CMNMP could be lost during the transfer \nof executing agency responsibilities from Bapepam-LK to the FPO. The transition of financial \nsector supervision to OJK could be undermined by political influence and specific reforms \n                                                \n23 ADB. 2012.

To control these risks, \nthe government has adopted a number of mitigation measures, including a consensus driven \nselection  process  within  the  government  to  choose  the  initial  members  of  the  board  of \ncommissioners of OJK and a high-level committee that will manage operational risks arising \nfrom the transition. ADB is processing a TA to ensure continuity of reforms by strengthening the \ncapacity  of  the  FPO  and  ensuring  the  policy  actions  initiated  under  the  program  are \nimplemented fully (para. 20).
