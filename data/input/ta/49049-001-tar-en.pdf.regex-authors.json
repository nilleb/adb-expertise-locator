INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  regional research and  development  technical  assistance (TA)  will  contribute to \npromoting smart infrastructure and systems in selected cities under the Future Cities Program \n(FCP) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB),1 with particular emphasis on pro-poor support, \nfacilitating positive steps toward sustainable and livable cities, and knowledge solutions consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020.2 The TA is aligned with Strategy 2020, which \npromotes environmentally sustainable development (particularly livable cities), and with ADB\u2019s \nMidterm Review of Strategy 2020, which emphasizes ADB\u2019s actions and need to be innovative, \ninclusive, integrated, and operationally relevant.3 The TA will identify smart solutions to improve \nthe living standards of city residents, focusing on the urban poor and women, and could lead to \nthe  preparation  of relevant  investment  projects  where  ADB  could  provide  further financing \nassistance.4 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  About 75% of Asia\u2019s gross domestic product is generated in urban areas and the quality \nand efficiency of its cities will determine the region\u2019s long-term productivity and stability.5 City \ninfrastructure must become \u201csmarter\u201d to foster efficiencies and become more resilient (footnote \n2). Smart systems refer to smart technologies, infrastructure systems, utilities, and intelligent \napproaches to providing infrastructure and other social services.6 The integration of multiple smart \nsystems solutions with city assets has great potential for citizens to improve their quality of life \nand to lead safer, healthier, and more knowledgeable lives. By applying innovative real-time digital \nsystems, sensors, and data management, municipal governments can (i) deliver infrastructure \nwith better service efficiency and access; (ii) improve transparency and interaction between city \nofficials, businesses, and citizens; (iii) enable faster, more responsive, and more inclusive service \nand city planning; and (iv) facilitate the reduction in urban barriers based on income, gender, or \nphysical location. Cities are at varying stages of development and have different capacities and \nconstraints.  These  may  include  low  investments  in,  and  insufficient  or  poor  supporting \ninfrastructure, which could result in relatively high technological infrastructure costs, political \nchallenges, and lack of capacity to maintain smart technologies. \n \nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n3.  The TA aims to enhance ADB\u2019s operational knowledge of promoting pro-poor smart \nsolutions to the development of cities by developing knowledge and learning products; facilitating \npartnerships between cities; and conducting pre-feasibility studies on smart solutions, with an \nemphasis on poverty reduction and inclusiveness, to enhance and leverage city and business \ninvestments, and citizens\u2019 potential. The TA will be applied in cities participating in the FCP \n(footnote 1), using the city relationships already created to enhance existing projects. It will also \nprovide  a  One  ADB  approach  toward  leveraging  additional  integrated  urban  investments, \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2015.

Impact and Outcome \n \n4.  The  impact  will  be  enhanced  sustainability  and  inclusiveness  for  smart  city  urban \ndevelopment projects in the Asia and Pacific region. The outcome will be the application of smart \ncity knowledge and practices, with an emphasis on those addressing poverty reduction and \ninclusiveness, to enhance ADB\u2019s FCP. This will include increasing awareness and enhancing \ninstitutional and professional capacity for smart city development, and preparing viable and \nsustainable pro-poor infrastructure and information technology management and development \nplans and/or projects in the five pilot cities: Bandung (Indonesia), Greater Suva Area (Suva City \nand  Lami,  Nasinu,  and  Nausori  towns  [Fiji]),  Mandalay  (Myanmar),  Tbilisi  (Georgia),  and \nUlaanbaatar (Mongolia).8  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n5.  The TA will assist the selected cities under ADB\u2019s FCP to move toward more sustainable \napproaches to implementing smarter infrastructure and systems, with an emphasis on those \nsupporting pro-poor and inclusive initiatives. It will complement other current and proposed \nregional TA projects in e-governance, water supply, waste management and financial systems \ninnovation, and spatial data and activities being undertaken by ADB sector and thematic groups.9 \nTogether with these projects, this TA will achieve a more holistic and focused impact; add value \nto  existing  and  planned  investment  projects;  and  make  ADB\u2019s  financing  modalities  more \nresponsive, smarter, and better integrated. Identifying and prioritizing smart city investments to \nbe guided under this TA will be driven by demand from participating city governments, in \nconsultation with the poorer segments of the urban population and taking into account ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategies and country operations business plans. The TA project has three \noutputs.  \n \n6.  Output 1: Cities engaged in understanding, identifying, and sharing best practice \npathways toward smart infrastructure for future livable cities with an emphasis on pro-\npoor initiatives. The project will facilitate the establishment of smart city focus groups in at least \nfour of the selected cities. To ensure that any future smart city policies and solutions are inclusive \nand competitive, each focus group will have representatives from government, business, and pro-\npoor civil societies. Twinning10 arrangements established under the FCP may be expanded and \nwill be further supported between FCP cities and other relevant cities around the world.11 \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2013. Knowledge Management Directions and Action Plan (2013\u20132015): Supporting \u201cFinance ++\u201d at the Asian \nDevelopment Bank. Manila. \n8  The cities were selected in coordination with ADB\u2019s developing member countries and regional departments. Each \nselected city has current and planned ADB urban projects, strong municipal partnerships, and an ability to use \nfinancial support to build economic, equitable, and environmentally sustainable cities. No objection letters for the \nFCP, which includes this TA, were obtained from all relevant governments. \n9  These include ADB. 2013.

Manila. \n10 Twinning refers to city-to-city partnerships where one city mentors another in a collaborative manner and shares \nknowledge and resources to achieve a common objective. \n11 Some twinning will be facilitated by this TA, but financed from other sources. Twinning activities financed by this TA \nmay jointly develop technical and/or management improvement plans tailored for the city, and include reciprocal \n ", "3 \nAdditional twinning partners will be identified in the course of TA implementation, which may then \nlead to numerous synergies and learning opportunities. These will be based on and will leverage \nexisting city research partnerships and business relationships established under the FCP or other \nprograms such as Japan\u2019s Joint Crediting Mechanism.12 Based on consultations with cities and \ninputs from the twinning partners, and using available smart city tools and case studies, smart \ncity diagnostics will be conducted in each selected city. Smart city management improvement \nplans will also be developed. These will guide both the selection of potential future financing \ninitiatives with a pro-poor emphasis, and rank those for further pre-feasibility study. \n \n7.  Output 2: Integrated smart infrastructure projects, emphasizing pro-poor initiatives, \nconceptualized with concrete funding modalities. Pre-feasibility studies will be prepared for a \nsmall number of pro-poor, smart investment initiatives in selected cities based on the ideas \ndeveloped in the smart city diagnostics and in conjunction with the twinning programs and \nknowledge hub partners. At least one pre-feasibility study will be developed in each of at least \nthree cities. The studies will be selected in coordination with the city, the respective operations \ndepartment, and the established user groups; and be structured to support or complement \nongoing investment in the city. Among the potential areas of feasibility study are pilots that \naddress systemic infrastructure inefficiencies (such as utility metering, traffic management, street \nlighting, or women\u2019s transit safety); enhance inclusion and diversity (such as e-access by the poor \nand women to municipal services and information, small enterprise development, or leadership \nand networking); and enhance the city as a regional hub (e-trade, e-governance, e-learning). The \npre-feasibility studies will assess the potential for further evaluation of investment opportunities \nand relevant financing modalities. The TA will also develop business and investment opportunity \nbriefs, based on the pre-feasibility studies, that demonstrate the financial viability of smart city \noptions for investors. \n \n8.  Output 3: Smart city knowledge products and smart city networks developed. The \nTA will provide best practices and knowledge on smart cities to assist in the implementation of \nactivities under outputs 1 and 2; collate lessons learned; and enhance networking, information \nexchange, and training. ADB\u2019s knowledge partner, the City of Yokohama, will undertake this work \nwith support from the TA consultants and available resources.13 With the assistance of this TA, \nYokohama  will  further  develop  its  Asia  Smart  City  Alliance  (ASCA)  together  with  other \norganizations such as Japan Smart Community Alliance; and consolidate and share knowledge \nwith other Asian cities, particularly those cities selected under this TA. Smart solutions and \npractical  urban  management  knowledge  will  be  disseminated  through  an  enhanced  ASCA \nwebsite, the annual Asia Smart City Conference, and other networking events. The Y-PORT \nCenter will collect data on smart city development practices across Asia; examine current global \nresearch on innovative and emerging models of smart cities; and, in consultation with the ADB \nteam and subject cities, develop Smart City Guidelines. The guidelines will provide a diagnostic \ntool for the city\u2019s smart administrative and fiscal capabilities and be drafted for possible application \nin selected cities by the end of December 2016. The city will also launch an Annual Report on \nSmart City Best Practices on or before the 50th Annual Meeting of the ADB Board of Governors \nin Yokohama in 2017. This report will feature the best practices of smart cities around the world, \n                                                \nvisits to learn from the mentor city and/or organization. On-the-job training may also be considered. The project will \ncover the out-of-pocket expenses but not the staff time cost. \n12 Japan\u2019s Joint Crediting Mechanism already partners Osaka with Ho Chi Minh City and Kawasaki with Bandung. \nThere are also existing links between Kitakyushu and Mandalay. \n13 The City of Yokohama holds an Annual Asia Smart City Conference, which could be expanded to capture examples \nof best practices from Asian cities. It also established the Y-PORT Center in April 2015, which is dedicated to fostering \nknowledge on smart urban solutions and city management among city leaders and facilitating city-to-city learning. A \nmemorandum of understanding was signed between ADB and the City of Yokohama on 5 May 2016. \n ", "4 \nwith a particular emphasis on Asian case studies, and provide updated information on smart city \npolicy. The TA will also assist Yokohama in conducting training and regional conferences in at \nleast four of the selected cities and ensure regional cities\u2019 participation in Yokohama\u2019s Annual \nSmart City Conference is increased. \n \n9.  The TA will integrate with initiatives from current and planned regional TA projects under \nADB\u2019s FCP, encouraging cross-sector practice and identifying public\u2013private partnerships or \nopportunities to leverage funds from ADB\u2019s Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund, the \nCities Development Initiative for Asia, and other development partners to prepare feasibility and \ninvestment projects. The TA will also explore possible partnerships with ADB\u2019s Office of Public\u2013\nPrivate Partnership and Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD).14 \n \n10.  The risks of TA implementation are in Appendix 1. The assumptions are that (i) the \nselected cities make smart city development management a priority for policy and investment, (ii) \nthe Y-PORT Center knowledge hub has adequate technical and institutional capacities to become \nthe primary smart city resource in the region, (iii) decision makers in the cities recognize the hub \nas  a  reputable  institution  in  smart  city  development,  (iv)  city  mentors  are  willing  to share \nexperience on management with recipients, (v) the studies are able to demonstrate the feasibility \nof potential pro-poor smart systems investments, and (vi) adequate resources are available for \ncities to identify and undertake investment opportunities for smart city development. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $2 million, which will be financed by a grant \nfrom the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB will be the executing agency and will implement the TA through the Urban Sector \nGroup Secretariat of the Sector Advisory Service Division in the Sustainable Development and \nClimate Change Department. The TA will be managed by the ADB team leader of the FCP,  that \nhas been established by the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department in \ncooperation with regional departments, PSOD, and other sector and thematic groups. The FCP \nwill ensure that the TA is integrated with other activities in the selected cities so that its outputs \nare better utilized and enhanced. The TA will be implemented from August 2016 to December \n2018, but may be considered for expansion and replenishment through other funding, depending \non its achievement and relevance for facilitating smart systems investments. \n \n13.  The TA will use output-based terms of reference to engage two consulting firms. The firms \nwill be selected through fixed budget selection to ensure the technical suitability of the proposals. \nProposals will be ranked by technical scores only within a budget ceiling. Contracts will be output-\nbased and out-of-pocket expenses will be provided as a lump sum for all consulting services as \nmay be workable. Resource persons for the conferences and workshops, city coordinators, and \nconsultants will be engaged following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Procurement  of  non-consulting  inputs  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). TA \n                                                \n14 Partnership with PSOD and the Office of Public\u2013Private Partnerships, as may be applicable, will be guided by the \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership Operational Plan \n \n ", "5 \ndisbursements will be made following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time).15 \n \n14.  Outputs 1 and 2 will be undertaken by a firm over two phases. Output 1 will be for a fixed \nbudget and include the establishment of smart system user groups, preparation of smart city \ndiagnostics, and delivery of pro-poor smart city development plans. Output 2 will require the \nnegotiation of the additional unallocated budget to support the selected consultant to deliver three \npre-feasibility studies and investment proposals on pro-poor, smart system projects identified in \noutput 1 and agreed with all stakeholders. ADB will also engage civil society representatives and \ncity coordinators as individual consultants to help develop networking within the cities over both \nphases. Output 3 will be delivered by engaging a firm using output-based terms of reference and \nfixed budget selection. Based in Yokohama, the firm will support the Y-PORT Center to deliver \nproject outputs. \n \n15.  With inputs from the consultants and Yokohama city through the Y-PORT Center, the \nSector  Advisory  Service  Division  will  prepare  the  required  progress  reports,  supervise  TA \nactivities, and make reports available through the ADB website. The TA progress and outputs will \nbe disseminated through the ADB website, the enhanced ASCA website, or the smart city \nknowledge website. Knowledge sharing will be through the dissemination of knowledge products; \nseminars  of  the  Urban  Sector  Group;  and  other  events,  forums,  and  workshops.  As  a \ndevelopment partner, the City of Yokohama is expected to support TA implementation, including \nby (i) assisting in advocacy and knowledge sharing by inviting cities and developing member \ncountries to the Asia Smart City Conference, (ii) facilitating the identification and introduction of \nrelevant cities for potential twinning during the events, and (iii) providing case studies and \ntechnical and knowledge support. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for the Promoting Smart Systems in ADB\u2019s \nFuture Cities Program, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n15 Appendix 3 provides the outline terms of reference for the consultants. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact, the TA is aligned with \nSustainable and inclusive investments in smart city development projects in Asia and the Pacific are \nenhanced (ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020; Strategy 2020; and Midterm Review of Strategy \n2020)a \n   \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting   Risks  \nOutcome       \nSmart city knowledge  By 2018, at least three cities have  City urban  There is a lack of \nand good practices  initiated urban planning or policy  development plans  strong political will to \ntargeting pro-poor  on promoting smart city  and urban sector  support smart city \ninitiatives enhance  development (2015 baseline: NA)  reports from DMCs  development. \nADB\u2019s FCP projects \nOutputs       \n1.

General \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will administer the regional technical assistance (TA), \nwhich is an integral part of the umbrella project for Establishing the Future Cities Program (FCP) \nin the Asia and Pacific Region.1 The TA is designed to enhance ADB\u2019s operations in selected \ncities  under  FCP  by  identifying,  conceptualizing,  and  preparing  pre-feasibility  studies  for \ninnovative pro-poor and smart approaches to integrated urban development. \n \n2.  The main work will be divided into two packages2 to be procured using output-based terms \nof reference (TOR) and fixed budget selection to select two separate firms (one for each package). \nOther support work may be undertaken by recruiting nongovernment organizations (NGOs), \nresource persons, and city coordinators using individual consultant selection. \n \nB.  Package A: Smart Infrastructure (for Outputs 1 and 2) \n \n3.  The smart infrastructure package will be delivered by a firm over two phases. The firm will \nprepare a full technical proposal in response to the output-based TOR, and be selected using a \nfixed budget for the first phase of the work. Following completion of the first phase in each city \nand agreement by all stakeholders on proposed outputs for phase 2, the firm will negotiate with \nADB to utilize the remaining unallocated budget to deliver the second phase.  \n \n4.  The proposed team will have, at the minimum, the following staff: \n(i)  Senior urban technologies specialist (international). The specialist will have \nrelevant qualifications and experience to deliver the outputs and manage the \nconsulting team. The specialist will preferably have at least 10 years of experience \nin developing new technologies and implementing innovative urban technology \nprojects  in  at  least  one  of  the  following  areas:  transport,  energy,  water,  or \ninformation and communication technology; and demonstrated strong skills in \nengaging municipal governments and the community. Ideally, the consultant will \nhave experience of and be familiar with ADB operations and procedures, and have \nlocal working experience in Asia. \n(ii)  Smart city engagement consultants (national, one consultant for each city). \nThey will have relevant experience and qualifications, and support the team to \nachieve all outputs and coordinate interaction at the city level. \n(iii)  Other phase 1 team members will be proposed as part of the full technical proposal \nto deliver the outputs. Phase 2 teams will be determined later as part of the outputs \ndetailed for phase 1. \n \n5.  Phase  1.  The  objective  of  phase  1  will  be  to  ensure  that  cities  are  engaged  in \nunderstanding, identifying, and sharing best practice pathways toward smart infrastructure to \nbecome more livable cities, with an emphasis on pro-poor initiatives. This will be achieved by \nestablishing  and  supporting  smart  city  user  groups  and  innovation  centers,  facilitating  city \ntwinning3 activities with other cities and businesses, and developing diagnostics and management \nimprovement plans. The initiatives will be established in a way that would make them self-\nsustaining beyond the project life. \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2015. Technical Assistance for Establishing the Future Cities Program in the Asia and Pacific Region. Manila \n(approved December 2015). \n2  Package A: Smart Infrastructure; and Package B: Smart City Knowledge Development. \n3  Twinning refers to city-to-city partnerships where one city mentors another in a collaborative manner and shares \nknowledge and resources to achieve a common objective. \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n \n6.  The consultants will complete the following tasks within 18 months from being hired: \n(i)  Establish and support urban innovation centers. In at least four cities and \nwithin 3 months of starting field work, the consultants will establish and staff a \nsmart city urban innovation center (UIC) in coordination with the reciprocal city \ndepartment. The UICs will be designed to bring together government agencies, \ncompanies, and individuals at the forefront of their fields and give them space to \ncollaborate. UIC staff will collect local city data and promote international best \npractices in smart city infrastructure and systems (including infrastructure data \nsystems,  geo-located  data  systems,  and  city  resilience).  They  will  establish \nlinkages with other similar UICs in other cities, including those from the FCP, and \nwith regional and international organizations such as the Asia Smart City Alliance \n(ASCA). The UICs will host smart city and urban innovation events and be the \nclearing house for smart city knowledge and practice within the city. By June 2017, \nthe consultants will have prepared the documents outlining activities and measures \nto sustain UICs beyond 2017. \n(ii)  Establish and support smart city focus groups. In at least four cities and within \n3 months of starting field work, the consultants will establish and support core \nsmart city focus groups (SCFGs) and will encourage core representatives from key \nnational  and  city  governments;  mainstream  and  start-up  businesses;  and \ncommunity, youth, and pro-poor groups to network for better innovation and \nchange. The groups will meet as needed, but no less than once a month, and guide \nthe development of the UICs and act as the advisory group for the diagnostics and \neventual project selection for pre-feasibility studies. The groups will receive training \nand enhanced networking opportunities with other project activities, including \ntwinning and capacity building. They will lead discussions on innovation and \nchange with the city governments as well as with the local citizens, NGOs, and, if \napplicable, local universities and entrepreneurs. By June 2017, the consultants will \nhave prepared the documents outlining activities and measures to sustain the \nSCFGs beyond 2017. \n(iii)  Facilitate smart city twinning. The consultants will identify smart city twinning \npartners for each of the five FCP cities4 and establish and maintain contacts with \nthese  partners.  The  partners  could  be  cities  within  or  outside  the  region  or \nbusinesses interested in partnering with a city for development. Links with other \nFCP UICs should also be maintained. In consultation with ADB and the SCFGs, \nthe consultants will identify and conduct three bilateral twinning exchanges (of at \nleast 1 week) between cities (or city and organization). The exchanges will involve \nthe partner city and/or organization traveling to the subject city to have a proper \nunderstanding of the situation there, followed by at least four key people from the \nsubject city traveling to the partner city for detailed training and capacity and \nknowledge building. \n(iv)  Prepare smart city diagnostics. In conjunction with the SCFGs where relevant, \nthe consultants will undertake a smart city inventory and diagnostic covering all \ninfrastructure and services, identifying gaps and proposing phasing and areas for \nfurther investment. The diagnostics will be conducted using recognized tools and \ninternational practice, possibly including those developed under package B (with \nthe City of Yokohama). \n(v)  Prepare smart city management improvement plans. After the diagnostics and \nin conjunction with the SCFGs, the city, and ADB, the consultants will prepare a \n20-year smart city management improvement plan for each city. The plan will \n                                                \n4  Bandung, Greater Suva Area, Mandalay, Tbilisi, and Ulaanbaatar. \n ", "Appendix 3  11 \noutline potential activities, responsibilities, phasing, costs, and financing. It will \ninclude a discussion on the linkage of activities with the broader city master plan \nand development framework, and opportunities and risks that are prevalent. \n(vi)  Propose smart city investment projects. Based on the diagnostics and smart \ncity management improvement plans, the consultants will identify five potential \nsmart city investment projects for each city, with at least two addressing pro-poor \ninitiatives. They will prepare the initial concept papers for each project following \nADB guidelines. The concept papers will be of a quality that is usable for pre-\nfeasibility study advertising, and include TORs and detailed costing. \n(vii)  Rank and select projects for pre-feasibility studies. The consultants, ADB, and \nother stakeholders will further assess the 25 projects identified in para. 6 (vi). \n(a)  In consultation with ADB, the consultants will establish a multi-criteria \nranking mechanism for the projects for further study. The criteria will \ninclude potential for immediate financing, technical innovation, social and \neconomic impact, and pro-poor emphasis; with relevant justification for \neach criterion. Three of the 25 projects will be selected after discussion \nwith the cities and ADB. These will form the basis for a detailed submission \nto ADB (including full costing, output-based TOR, and proposed staffing) \nfor agreement. Based on negotiations with ADB, a project variation will be \nprocessed to add the required unallocated funds into the overall contract \nto complete phase 2. \n(b)  ADB and other stakeholders will assess the remaining projects for possible \nfurther  action  by  the  Cities  Development  Initiative  for  Asia  and  other \npartners. \n(viii)  Pilot public\u2013private partnership information and communication technology \ninvestment. The consultants will identify one pilot information and communication \ntechnology project in one city with a demonstrated potential for a public\u2013private \npartnership and for which support up to the financing stage will be provided. This \nwill include discussions with a private sector provider, development of a detailed \nbusiness proposal, and sourcing of seed funding to demonstrate the concept. \n(ix)  Prepare knowledge products. The consultants\u2019 tasks will involve the following: \n(a)  For each output, the consultants will document the processes together with \nthe issues and learning that took place. Before the 50th Annual Meeting of \nthe ADB Board of Governors in May 2017, the consultants will prepare a \ndiscussion paper summarizing these points and outlining the learnings to \ndate,  and  suggestions  and  expectations  for  the  remainder  of  the \nimplementation period. This will be updated before project conclusion. \n(b)  The consultants will draft a paper for publication on delivery and financing \nmechanism options (including public\u2013private partnerships) for smart city \ninfrastructure, and the design of project financing with incentives. \n(c)  The consultants will prepare a knowledge blog post once every 2 months, \nhighlighting the process that is taking place in the cities and the learning \nthat has occurred. \n \n7.  Phase 2. The objective of phase 2 will be to prepare pre-feasibility studies for three \nintegrated smart infrastructure projects that have a strong possibility to progress to financing and \nimplementation, emphasize pro-poor initiatives, and have concrete funding modalities. This will \nbe based on the assessments and selection process undertaken in phase 1; the detailed \nproposals (including output-based TOR, costing and technical proposal, and staffing) submitted; \nand an ADB assessment that would raise the contract amount from the unallocated budget. The \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \nphasing will allow the relevant technical teams and proposals to be developed to address the \nactual requirements of the project pre-feasibility studies. \n \n8.  The consultants will complete the three pre-feasibility studies by December 2018. By this \nstage, the studies will have formed part of the country operations business plan for the relevant \ncountry, identified concrete financing, and obtained commitments from government and ADB for \nimplementation. \n \nC.  Package B: Smart City Knowledge Development (for output 3) \n \n9.  The smart city knowledge development package will be delivered by a Yokohama-based \nfirm, which will work on a day-to-day basis with the Y-PORT Center. The firm will prepare a full \ntechnical proposal in response to the output-based TOR, which will be further developed by Y-\nPORT Center in consultation with ADB, and be selected using a fixed budget of $500,000. The \nfirm will assist the Y-PORT Center on knowledge formulation and sharing activities, but will also \ndeliver the following smart systems knowledge products: \n(i)  Provide day-to-day technical advice to the Y-PORT Center on ASCA and its \nnetwork enhancement with key institutions. The technical advice will be given on \nthe overall structure and management of the ASCA website to promote knowledge \nsharing on smart city development among members. \n(ii)  Conduct and deliver the following activities to substantively enhance ASCA: \n(a)  design  and  conduct  regular  web-based  knowledge  sharing  activities  \nthrough ASCA; \n(b)  collect data on practices of smart city developments in Asian countries \nthrough a literature review and an interview survey; and \n(c)  examine and collate a database of current research on innovative and \nemerging models of smart cities. \n(iii)  Prepare smart city guidelines based on the above activities. The guidelines will \nprovide  diagnostic  tools  for  the  city\u2019s  administrative  and  fiscal  capabilities, \nincluding smart city indicators. \n(iv)  Prepare and launch the Annual Report on Smart City Best Practices. This report \nwill cover the best practices of smart cities around the world and provide updated \ninformation on the smart city policy. \n(v)  Prepare and deliver 3-day smart city best practice workshops and disseminate \nsmart city program activities in at least four of the five pilot cities. \n(vi)  Working with ASCA and the Japan Smart Community Alliance, establish linkages \nbetween  Japanese  cities  and firms  and  each of the five  cities,  and support \nexchange visits. \n(vii)  Disseminate relevant city-to-city collaboration activities and their outcome through \nASCA. \n(viii)  Provide technical advice to the Y-PORT Center on the annual Asia Smart City \nConference to enhance its technical substance as a platform for urban smart \nsolutions. \n \nD.
