This regional technical assistance (RETA) aims to familiarize  officials of  Developing \nMember  Countries  (DMCs)  of  the  East  and  Central  Asia  Department  (ECRD)  with  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) policies and procedures regarding the financial management (FM) of \nADB-financed investment projects, as set out in the Guidelines for the Financial Governance \nand Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB (the guidelines).1 The proposed TA \nis included in ADB\u2019s 2003 TA program. The TA framework is provided in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The 1966 ADB Charter (Articles of Agreement) requires ADB to take measures to ensure \nthat the proceeds of any loan made, guaranteed, or participated in by ADB are \u201cused only for \nthe purposes for which the loan was approved with due attention to consideration of economy \nand efficiency.\u201d Moreover, ADB\u2019s operations must be guided by sound banking principles. To \nsupport this accountability, ADB approved the release of the revised guidelines in 2001. They \nset out ADB\u2019s requirements and procedures for the FM of ADB-financed projects and provide \nguidance on applying these requirements. To support the implementation of the guidelines, ADB  \nprepared  the  Handbook  for  Borrowers  on  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of \nInvestment Projects Financed by ADB (the handbook).  \n \n3.  The  other  multilateral  development  banks  (MDBs)\u2014including  the  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction and Development,  Islamic Development Bank, and  World Bank\u2014have similar \nobjectives and engage in similar activities, but have different FM approaches and requirements. \nThese variances create confusion among DMCs. They also impose unnecessary compliance \ncosts and divert limited resources away from key priorities. In 2000, the MDBs began work to \nreduce these differences. The  guidelines are being updated to reflect agreements that have \nbeen reached on harmonized MDB approaches in several areas.  \n \n4.  Portfolio  performance  at  the  country,  sector,  and  project  levels;  and  sound  FM \nprocedures and practices of executing agencies are increasingly factored into ADB's country \nprogramming  and  project  processing  activities.  The  guidelines  encourage  rigorous  FM \nassessments of EAs during project design and, where necessary, advocate efforts to strengthen \nFM capacity, with the objective of reinforcing ADB's efforts to promote better governance, and \nfiduciary safeguards and controls in project implementation.  \n \n5.  ECRD has one of ADB\u2019s largest portfolios. In 2002, ADB approved  $1.19 billion to \nfinance 18 loans in ECRD DMCs. At the end of 2002, ECRD had 102 ongoing projects with a \nnet loan amount of about $8.3 billion. Total loan disbursements in 2002 were 22% higher than \nprojected at $885 million.  \n \n6.  An effective tool in monitoring project and portfolio performance is the quality and timely \nsubmission of audited project accounts  and  financial statements. Quality is reflected in the \ncompleteness, consistency, reliability, and presentation of financial information. Timeliness of \nsubmission is also a key element of accountability. In 2002, of the 59 ECRD loans requiring \nsubmission of financial statements, 33 loans had complied fully, 22 had  complied late (by less \nthan 6 months), 3 had  partly complied, and 3 had not complied. Although this represented a \nsignificant improvement in the timeliness of   submissions during 2001, the performance was \nbelow the ADB average. Moreover, most ECRD DMCs have only recently begun to establish \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 20 February 2003. ", "2   \nmarket-based accounting and auditing arrangements. The shortage of professionally qualified \naccountants directly affects EA FM arrangements.  \n \n7.  ECRD places a high priority on portfolio performance and  has taken a number of \ninitiatives  to  improve  portfolio  quality  and  increase  the  effectiveness,  efficiency,  and \nsustainability of projects in recent years. ADB\u2019s  People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) Resident \nMission  spearheaded one such activity,  in early 2003, when the financial management review \n(FMR) was conducted to (i) assess EAs' FM policies, procedures, and practices; (ii) ensure that \nloan proceeds are used only for designated purposes; (iii) ensure that project-generated assets \nare properly managed and safeguarded; and (iv) ensure that borrowers comply with financial \ncovenants. \n \n8.  Specific FMR objectives were to (i) assess the soundness of EAs' FM systems, policies, \nprocedures,  and  practices;  (ii)  identify  issues  and  problems  EAs  faced  in  complying  with \nfinancial covenants and other FM requirements; and (iii) identify generic FM issues affecting \nproject implementation and financial performance.  The FMR revealed that EAs have limited \nunderstanding  of  ADB  FM  requirements,    identified  gaps  and  weaknesses  in  EA's  FM \nprocedures, and provided valuable insights into the FM challenges faced by EAs in the PRC \nand how these might be addressed. Among other things, the FMR report recommends that EAs' \nFM practices be improved through (i) training on ADB's FM requirements, and (ii) assistance to \nstrengthen internal controls in ADB-financed projects.  \n \n9.  The PRC-focused FMR revealed the importance of identifying FM-related issues and \nconstraints at the country, sector, and individual EA levels, before identifying and implementing \ncorrective responses. Given this success, the conduct of FMRs in other ECRD countries is likely \nto provide a clear assessment of existing FM practices so that appropriate responses can be \ntailored  to  each  DMC.  ADB  has  also  undertaken  other  initiatives  to  strengthen  financial \nmanagement in ECRD DMCs. First, assistance has been provided to strengthen supreme audit \ninstitutions.  Second,  diagnostic  studies  of  accounting  and  auditing  (DSAAs)  have  been \nconducted for Azerbaijan, Kyrgyz Republic, PRC, Mongolia,  and Uzbekistan. Third, substantial \nassistance has been provided to strengthen individual EAs. Fourth, ADB provides  training in a \nrange  of  FM-related  areas,  including  project  economic  analysis,  loan  disbursement,  and \nconsultant recruitment. \n \n10.  A key FMR recommendation is that training be provided to familiarize EAs with ADB FM \nrequirements and approaches. In particular, that borrowers, project executing staff, auditors, \nand other related staff should be exposed to the concepts and techniques set out in the \nguidelines. To this end, ADB approved a small-scale TA  to conduct FM training through three \npilot workshops in selected DMCs.2 To fully realize the benefits to ECRD\u2019s portfolio of the FM \ntraining programs, additional efforts should be exerted to cover DMCs in ECRD.  \n \n11.  To sustain the benefits of the FM training program, the TA will also support translation  \nof the guidelines and the handbook, which are currently only available in English, into selected \nlanguages.    \n \n12.  Improving EA FM practices is a long-term task requiring continuing assistance. The TA \nwill build on ADB\u2019s past work, while reflecting the FMR recommendations.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2002.

The overall goal of the TA is to strengthen the capacity of DMC\u2019s EAs for FM of ADB-\nfinanced investment projects, which will contribute to improved project quality and sustainability \nand better performance in terms of compliance with loan covenants.  \n \n14.  To achieve this goal, the TA aims to familiarize  EAs with ADB's FM requirements and \ntheir application, and strengthen EAs\u2019 capacity to apply the best FM practices. Components of \nthe  TA  also  seek  to  improve   timeliness  of submissions  and  quality  of  audited financial \nstatements and project accounts and the quality of auditors\u2019 reports. The TA will also assist in \nidentifying opportunities to harmonize FM practices with other development partners. Drawing \non this work, the TA will (i) translate the handbook in selected local languages; (ii) prepare or \nupdate DSAAs for Kazakhstan,  PRC, Mongolia, and Uzbekistan; (iii)  develop a system of \nFinancial Management Review (FMR) for selected countries; and (iv) conduct training programs \non FM. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA has four  components (i) translating and distributing the handbook in selected \nlanguages; (ii) preparing or updating DSAAs for selected DMCs; (iii) conducting FMRs; and (iv) \ndeveloping and conducting training workshops. \n \n16.   Handbook.  The  handbook  will  be,  as  appropriate,  translated  into  Azeri,  Chinese, \nKazakh, Kyrgyz, Mongolian, Russian, and Uzbek and copies distributed to all EAs of ECRD's \nADB-financed investment projects and to coordinating agencies.  \n \n17.  Diagnostic Studies of Accounting and Auditing. In 2000, ADB conducted DSAAs for  \nPRC, Mongolia, and  Uzbekistan.  In  2002\u20132003, DSAAs were prepared for Azerbaijan and \nKyrgyz Republic.  To provide up-to-date information on the accounting and auditing environment \nand challenges faced, the DSAAs for PRC, Mongolia, and Uzbekistan will be updated and a \nDSAA will be prepared for Kazakhstan. 3   \n \n18.   Financial Management Reviews. The TA will conduct FMRs for Mongolia, Kazakhstan, \nKyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan ( footnote 3).  Appendix 2 presents the outline for \neach FMR and for the summary FMR. Each FMR will involve \n \n(i)  assessing the soundness of EA FM systems and practices at the regional, \nnational, sectoral, and project levels; \n \n(ii)  identifying issues and problems  EAs face in complying with project financial \ncovenants and ADB\u2019s FM requirements; \n \n(iii)  identifying  generic  FM  issues  affecting  project  implementation  and  financial \nperformance; \n \n(iv)  assessing the internal control environment of the DMC with emphasis on the \nregulatory framework and the mechanism for supervision; \n                                                 \n3  Findings will be discussed with the related authorities of each government and will be incorporated in the country \nroad maps for financial management. \n \n ", "4   \n \n(v)  assessing  the    EAs'  internal  control  procedures  in  relation  to  the  best \ninternational practices; \n \n(vi)  identifying opportunities to harmonize FM requirements and practices with other \ndevelopment agencies; and \n \n(vii)  identifying measures to improve compliance with ADB's FM requirements. \n \n19.   Training. The following will be accomplished to provide training on FM requirements \n(i)  DMC-specific training programs and materials will be developed that reflect the \nFMR findings and  use the training materials prepared under the small-scaleTA.  \n \n(ii)  Nine 5-day workshops will be conducted for participants from Azerbaijan, PRC, \nKazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Mongolia,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and \nUzbekistan.  The  training  programs  will  explain  ADB\u2019s    expectations  and \nrequirements  for  FM,  and  consider  the  practical  application  of  these \nrequirements. Training participants will (a) examine the preliminary FMR findings \nand recommendations; (b) confirm the diagnosis and make amendments where \nnecessary; and (c) identify concrete, timebound action that can be taken to \nstrengthen FM in their agency. \n \n(iii)   An impact assessment of the FMR and FM training activities will be conducted. \nThis  will  involve  (a)  follow-up  questionnaires  to  training  participants,   their \nsupervisors, and ADB project and resident mission staff right after the workshop \nand 6 months after each workshop conducted; (b) preparation of a framework to \ncompare the pre- and post-exercise quality of audited financial statements and \nproject accounts submitted by participating EAs; and (c) pre- and post-exercise \nquality reviews of the statements and accounts submitted by participating EAs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $450,000 equivalent consisting entirely of foreign \nexchange, which will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from ADB's TA funding program. The \nTA will finance the services of (i) an international consultant (10 person-months) to assist in the \ndesign and implementation of the FMRs, the preparation of the DSAAs, the training workshops, \nand the impact assessment; and (ii) domestic consultants (14 person-months) to  help prepare \nthe DSAAs, undertake the FMRs, and conduct the training workshops. The detailed cost \nestimates are presented in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  East  and  Central  Asia  Department,  with  technical  inputs  and  assistance  from \ninternational and domestic consultants, will be the EA for this TA. The TA will commence on 1 \nOctober 2003 and be completed by 30 June 2005. The financial management specialist  of the \nGovernance, Finance, and Trade Division of ECRD will administer and supervise the TA. The \nfinancial management specialist in the Regional and Sustainable Development Department will \nattend selected workshops as a resource person. The relevant resident missions will  assist with \nlogistics as necessary, including identifying interpreters and translators, providing feedback on \ntranslation quality, and identifying potential training facilities. Resident mission staff will be \nencouraged to participate in the workshops. \n \n \n ", "    5 \n22.  The training programs will be conducted in  five DMCs, with participants from  eight   \nDMCs: five workshops will be held in the PRC covering different provinces; one  workshop will \nbe conducted in Uzbekistan and will include participants from Azerbaijan; one workshop will be \nheld in Mongolia; one workshop will be held in the Kyrgyz Republic and will include participants \nfrom Turkmenistan; and one workshop will be held in Kazakhstan and will include participants \nfrom Tajikistan. \n \n23.   ADB will select workshop participants on the basis of their responsibilities in EAs' offices \nand other relevant agencies, which include but are not limited to national government, national \naudit  offices,  and  finance  bureaus.  Governments  may  nominate  participants  for  ADB \nconsideration and acceptance on the basis of the relevance of their work. Criteria for selecting \nparticipants will be developed and forwarded to the ECRD member governments. Fundamental \ncriteria for the nomination and acceptance of participants will include the nominee's current work \nresponsibilities,  particularly  the  involvement  in  the  FM  aspects  of  ADB-financed  project \nadministration.  About  30\u201335 participants are expected to attend each workshop. Relevant \nofficers of the resident mission in the host country will be encouraged to participate in the \ntraining activities. \n \n24.  The TA will require an estimated 10 person-months of international  and 14 person-\nmonths of domestic consultant input to help design and prepare the FMRs, facilitate translation \nof the handbook, and  prepare and conduct training workshops. The international and domestic \nconsultants will have a certified public accountant  or equivalent qualification. The international \nconsultant, who will act as the team leader, will have extensive experience in FM requirements \nfor externally-financed investment projects. The domestic consultant  must  have  had project \naccounting experience in ECRD member countries. \n \n25.  The international and domestic consultants will, in consultation with the ECGF's FMS, \nconduct the FMR and DSAA, prepare background papers for the workshops, develop training \nprograms, and implement the training. The consultants will be recruited on an individual basis in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for their engagement. The consultants will produce an inception report 3 \nweeks after commencement of services of domestic consultants; a draft final report 2 weeks \nprior to the conclusion of their  assignment; and the final report at the end of the assignment, \nand taking into account ADB\u2019s comments. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n26.
