THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan (PBL) to Georgia for the Electricity Transmission Sector Reforms Program. \n \n2.  The proposed program aims to strengthen the structure of the transmission subsector and \nthe  institutional  environment  of  Georgia\u2019s  electricity  transmission  company,  the  Joint-Stock \nCompany  Georgian  State  Electrosystem  (GSE),  and  thereby  enhance  the  transmission \nsubsector\u2019s efficiency and improve its financial aspects. These reforms are critical to strengthen \nGSE\u2019s corporate governance, financial management, transparency, and debt sustainability. The \nprogram will be supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) through a single tranche stand-\nalone PBL, with a post-program engagement framework (PPEF). \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Macroeconomic context.1 Georgia\u2019s economy performed well during 2011\u20132019, with \naverage gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 4.7% per year. In 2019, Georgia achieved its \nlowest fiscal deficit in 10 years (2.2% of GDP), a historically low current account deficit (5.1% of \nGDP), its lowest unemployment rate (11.6%), and the lowest rate of poverty (still high at 20.1%, \nbut nearly halved compared with 2007). The public debt-to-GDP ratio in 2019 was 44.5%, below \nthe 60% ceiling, with expenditure as a share of GDP at 28.3%.2 In 2019, the lari depreciated by \n8.9% against the United States dollar and in 2020 by 5.6%. \n \n4.  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic impacted the Georgian economy through \n(i) a slowdown in tourism, (ii) trade disruptions, (iii) capital outflow, and (iv) an increase in the cost \nof finance. In 2020, the current account deficit widened significantly to 12.3% of GDP, driven by \nan 83% year-on-year decline in tourism revenues. Estimates by the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) predict the current account deficit narrowing down to \u2013\n10.9% of GDP in 2021.The public debt-to-GDP ratio increased to 60.8%, slightly above the ceiling \nof 60% (footnote 2) and the real GDP contracted by 6.2% in 2020.3 The tax revenues fell from \n23.7% of GDP in 2019 to 22.2% in 2020. Georgia\u2019s fiscal policy response to the pandemic has \nbeen robust. In 2020, tax relief amounted to GEL362 million (0.7% of GDP), fiscal expenditures \ntotaled GEL1,504 million (3% GDP)4, and capital spending was GEL73 million (0.1% GDP). Due \nto declining revenues, and increasing expenses, the fiscal deficit reached 9.3% of GDP, but \nremained below 10.1% ceiling agreed under the Extended Fund Facility Arrangement with the \nIMF. Budgetary response to COVID-19 continues in 2021 with an additional GEL1,247 million \n(2.3% GDP) assistance package.5 As a result, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to remain \nmarginally above the ceiling, at 61% in 2021. According to IMF estimates, the public debt-to-GDP \nratio is expected to fall back to legal ceiling of 60% of GDP by 2023 (footnote 5). \n \n \n1  ADB. 2020. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Countercyclical \nSupport Facility Loan to Georgia: COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program. Manila. \n2  The Economic Liberty Act, adopted in 2011 and effective since 2014, established numerical upper limits for general \ngovernment debt (60% of GDP), and the budget balance (3% of GDP). Public debt and budget balance rules have \nbeen adhered to since their introduction. \n3  IMF 2021. Georgia. Staff Concluding Statement of the 2021 Article IV Mission (19 July 2021). Washington, DC. \n4  A portion of these expenditures were subsidies for utility bills, which covered subscribers who consumed less than \n200 kWh of electricity and 200 m3 of natural gas per month. \n5  IMF. 2021. \u201cGeorgia: Eighth review under the extended fund facility arrangement.\u201d \n ", "2 \n \n5.  Due in part to Georgia\u2019s pandemic response, the economy is expected to rebound in 2021. \nGrowth is expected to turn positive with an increase in GDP of 7.7% in 2021, and a further \nincrease of 5.8% in 2022.6 The tourism sector is expected to experience a gradual recovery, \ngrowing by 56% from its low 2019 level. Tax revenue is also expected to grow to 22.6% of GDP \nin 2021, a modest 2% growth rate. The current account deficit is expected to narrow to 10.9% of \nGDP in 2021 and then to 5.7% by 2026 (footnote 4). Georgia\u2019s robust policy response to the \npandemic likely prevented worse affects and rightly focused on the most vulnerable. At the same \ntime, the government\u2019s increased spending casts a light on structural weaknesses. Excessive \nexposure to foreign currency could place significant additional pressures on the fiscal position of \nthe  government,  potentially  widening  the  fiscal  deficit.7 Exposure to  currency  risk  includes \ncontingent liabilities from loans to GSE and other state-owned enterprises.  \n \n6.  The energy industry was also directly impacted by COVID-19 and the global response. \nEnergy consumption in Georgia has shifted with increases experienced in the residential sector \nand decreases in non-residential demand. The net effect was a 4.9% reduction in consumption \nfor  2020,  followed  by  an  increase  of  3.1%  year-on-year  during  the  first  quarter  of  2021. \nImportantly, at the end of Q1 in March 2021, consumption had risen by 16% indicating a robust \nrecovery in demand. In terms of international trade in electricity, Georgia remained a net importer \nin 2020 with a trade deficit of $58.7 million in terms of value (a drop of 16.8%).8   \n \n7.  Past energy sector reforms. The government is committed to supporting energy sector \ngrowth and has successfully implemented major reforms in the sector. Unbundling was initiated \nin 1996, and the existing utility was unbundled into separate generation, transmission, and \ndistribution companies. In 2012, various market and regulatory reforms were made to harmonize \nelectricity market legislation with those of Turkey and southeast European countries and to enable \ncompetitive  electricity  cross-border  trading.  In  June  2014,  Georgia  signed  an  Association \nAgreement with the European Union (EU), undertaking an obligation to become a member of the \nEuropean Energy Community (EEC) through ongoing reforms and legal approximation with the \nEU\u2019s third energy package adopted by the EU member states.9 These initiatives transformed the \nsector from a state monopoly to a liberalized market; most sector entities operate as private \ncompanies, and an independent regulator has been established, distribution assets have been \nprivatized, and long-term concessions and guaranteed power purchase agreements (PPAs) for \nprivate investments in hydropower plants have been introduced. The primary objective of the \nreforms was to promote energy security, increase private sector participation, and improve the \nenergy trade balance by reducing dependence on fuel imports while increasing electricity exports. \n \n8.  Structure of the energy sector. Power generation is open to private investors and \nseveral independent hydropower plants have been built. Independent power producers can sell \nelectricity bilaterally to large customers in Georgia or export to neighboring countries. There are \nthree  electricity  transmission  licensees:  (i)  SakRusEnergo,  which  connects  the  Russian \nFederation\u2019s grid with Georgia\u2019s grid, is 50% owned by Russian Inter RAO, and 50% by Georgia; \n(ii) GSE; and (iii) its subsidiary EnergoTrans, which are owned by Georgia. GSE owns and \noperates the national grid, while EnergoTrans owns a small transmission network used for \n \n \n6  ADB. 2019. Asian Development Outlook 2019: Strengthening Disaster Resilience.

It was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union in July 2009. \n ", "3 \n(i) import of electricity from Azerbaijan during winter peak times, and (ii) export surplus electricity \nto Turkey during the summer peak times. GSE is the only electricity dispatch licensee. Electricity \ndistribution is monopolized by two companies: (i) Telasi, which is partly state-owned, services \nTbilisi; and (ii) EnergoPro, which is privately owned, services all other areas. The country\u2019s energy \nsector is governed by an independent regulator, Georgian National Energy and Water Supply \nRegulatory Commission (GNERC), which regulates tariffs for water, electricity, and gas prices, \nincluding transmission, distribution, and retail tariffs. Cross-border traders are not regulated. \n \n9.  Development constraints. The Georgian economy faces a number of constraints (paras. \n10\u201316) related to the energy sector, which are being addressed by the government through steps \nto mitigate risks by undertaking necessary policy decisions, regular monitoring, and disclosures \nin its fiscal risk statement.  \n \n10.  Deteriorating financial performance of state-owned enterprises. There are 236 state-\nowned enterprises (SOEs), including 52 subsidiaries. The heavy reliance of SOEs on public \nfunding (through regular fiscal transfers and onlent loans) caused a significant fiscal drain on the \ngovernment budget, increasing government expenditures by an amount equivalent to 6% of GDP \nduring 2014\u20132018, with capital injection and onlending valued at 16% of total external national \ndebt in 2020. At the same time, SOEs generally have paid little or no dividends by way of return \non the government\u2019s equity investment. These SOEs also contribute heavily to high foreign \nexchange risk exposure (most debts are denominated in foreign currency) and new investment \nrequirements (18% of GDP over 2020\u20132022). Among the 236 SOEs, 6 are highly exposed, \nincluding 3 in the energy sector (Engurhesi,10 GSE, and EnergoTrans), 2 in transport, and 1 water \nsupply company. Georgia\u2019s SOE oversight mechanism and corporate integrity framework have \nlimited  capacity,  which  inhibits  timely  reporting  and  reduces  performance  quality  and \naccountability. The deteriorating financial performance of the SOEs is a key burden on the \nnational  economy  and  poses  a  high  risk  to  both  fiscal  and  financial  sustainability  and \ndevelopment. \n \n11.   Financial  reliance  of  Georgian  State  Electrosystem  and  EnergoTrans  on \ngovernment support. GSE, together with its subsidiary EnergoTrans, is one of the largest \nrecipients of external borrowing and SOE support from the government. The total debt of \nEnergoTrans is twice its underlying assets and accounts for nearly 3% of total government debt; \nwhen combined with GSE\u2019s debt, the total makes up 5.0% of government debt. This debt is \ndenominated in foreign currency, borrowed by the government and onlent to GSE with no \nadditional charge. The MOF is obliged to service this debt, even if GSE is unable to. As of \nDecember 2019, GSE\u2019s consolidated debt was GEL1.1 billion, including EnergoTran\u2019s debt of \nGEL597 million.11 This large debt accumulated over 10 years because of the need for GSE to \n(i) replace  its  obsolete Soviet-era  infrastructure; (ii)  expand  infrastructure to  ensure  energy \nsecurity and evacuate power from newly built private sector hydropower plants; and (iii) in the \ncase of EnergoTrans debt, invest in new infrastructure needed to enhance electricity trade with \nneighboring countries. To finance these investments, GSE relied fully on government support \n(both  equity  and  onlending),  as  the  requirement  was  huge  and  GSE  itself  was  under  a \nrehabilitation plan (para. 12). \n \n \n \n10 Engurhesi owns and operates the 1,300-megawatt Enguri dam, which accounts for about 40% of the country\u2019s \ngeneration. The company provides about 40% of its output to Abkhazia free of charge. \n11 As of December 2020, GSE\u2019s consolidated debt stands at GEL1.22 billion, including EnergoTrans\u2019s debt of GEL714 \nmillion. \n ", "4 \n \n12.  Georgian State Electrosystem\u2019s rehabilitation proceedings and debt management \nissues. In 2008 GSE filed for insolvency; its application was accepted by the court and a 15-year \nrehabilitation  plan  with  targets  set  for  improving  technical  and  financial  performance  was \napproved by the MOF, the secured creditor with more than 50% of claims.12 GSE could not pay \nits accumulated liabilities with the revenues it generated with its complex financial position.13 \nDuring  2010\u20132019  significant  progress  was  made  by  GSE,  and  technical  and  financial \nperformance targets set in the rehabilitation plan were met; growth in revenue, profit, and \ninvestments exceeded projections. With these improvements and current tariff settings, GSE \nremains profitable as a stand-alone entity. However, financial difficulties at EnergoTrans, which \nGSE took over as a subsidiary in 2009, have negatively impacted GSE\u2019s consolidated balance \nsheet. At the time of acquisition EnergoTrans had no debt, but it borrowed substantially to develop \ninfrastructure needed for connecting to Turkey for transit and trade purposes. EnergoTrans\u2019 \nfinancial stability was dependent on trade volumes, which did not materialize as projected \nbecause of low demand in Turkey, while regulated tariffs approved for EnergoTrans imposed \nunlimited market risk (para. 14) for an entity already struggling with trade volumes. \n \n13.  At the end of 2017, EnergoTrans breached its debt covenants and missed contractual \npayments, requiring the MOF to intervene and cover missed debt payments. Although GSE is \nparent  company  of  EnergoTrans,  and  has  the  capacity  to  provide  financial  support  to \nEnergoTrans, it could not intervene because of limitations under the ongoing rehabilitation plan. \nEnergoTrans\u2019 merger with GSE (para. 21) will allow GSE to provide liquidity support, and would \nsimplify its adoption of GSE\u2019s corporate framework and risk management guidelines, including \ngovernance, reporting, and risk management. \n \n14.  EnergoTrans  tariff  issues.  EnergoTrans  has  two  primary  assets  that  provide \ntransmission  services  from Georgia  to  Turkey;  given  a  100% regulated  asset  base (RAB) \ninclusion rate,14 these would represent $158 million in assets entitled to receive a 16.4% rate of \nreturn (according to the regulator\u2019s formula for calculating GSE\u2019s tariffs). However, because of the \ncurrent treatment by the regulator, EnergoTrans receives only partial inclusion (17.5% of RAB) \non its 400-kilovolt line assets, resulting in a total calculated RAB of $80 million. This partial \ninclusion severely impacts revenues and cash flows, and inhibits EnergoTrans from generating \nsufficient revenue to independently service its debt payments. Enhanced tariff settings would \nenable EnergoTrans to improve its revenue stream from transmission charges on domestic power \nflows and generate sufficient liquidity to repay its debt and recover impairment losses (its liabilities \nexceed its asset value). \n \n15.  Weak corporate governance. GSE\u2019s rehabilitation plan has targets for debt repayment \nand  the  level  of  government  support  for  the  financing  of  transmission,  rehabilitation,  and \nexpansion,  but  lacks  targets  for  GSE\u2019s  transformation  into  a  commercial  and  financially \nsustainable corporate entity. The MOF does not exercise its full supervisory responsibilities, but \nrather  limits  itself  to  reviewing  issues  involving  debt  repayment.  Given  the  absence  of  a \nsupervisory board and the fragmented division of responsibilities between ministries carrying out \ncreditor's committee functions, GSE\u2019s corporate performance is unsupervised and unchecked. \nThe risk posed by GSE\u2019s weak corporate governance is heightened by the fact that GSE operates \nin a system which lacks mature corporate governance norms. Under the existing noncorporate \n \n \n12 Other creditors include a bank, electricity distribution companies, several small companies, and individuals. \n13 According to rehabilitation plan, in 2008 GSE\u2019s total debt was GEL212.5 million, with a negative equity balance of \nGEL107 million. GSE has subsequently repaid its credit obligations as per the rehabilitation plan. \n14 According to GNERC, the regulated asset base comprises of tangible and intangible assets used in the utility\u2019s \nregulated activities, which are directly related to the respective regulated activities. \n ", "5 \nstructure, GSE will continue facing difficulty in establishing itself as a commercial entity and will \nremain reliant on public capital instead of private or commercial investment. \n \n16.  Increased  fiscal  risk  from  existing  guarantees  under  signed  power  purchase \nagreements. While PPAs have been instrumental for hedging major risks of hydropower plant \ndevelopers in Georgia, the cumulative cost of PPAs is highlighted by the IMF as a key source of \nfiscal risk for the country. The contingent liabilities of PPAs (estimated at about 8.0% of GDP in \n2018) impose liquidity and regulatory risks. In 2024, when the guarantees from the PPAs are set \nto peak, there will be a need to increase end-user tariffs as these contingent liabilities are \nanticipated to be met primarily by customers under the regulated pricing in the event when these \nplants are unable to export or when export price is less competitive. The government recognizes \nthat public finances are exposed to fiscal risks if all costs are not fully passed on to customers by \nthe regulator; to manage these risks, the government has agreed on some actions with the IMF, \nincluding monitoring fiscal risks and disclosing them in the annual fiscal risk statement. \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s  previous  engagement  and  lessons.  Lessons  from  the  ADB-financed \ntransmission project and regional experience in reforms suggest that (i) strong government \nownership is critical to achieving results, (ii) collaboration with development partners is essential \nfor synergy of reforms, (iii) continued and long-term engagement on reforms supported by \ninvestments is necessary for sustainability, and (iv) strengthened monitoring and evaluation is \nneeded for effective continuation of the reform initiatives.15  \n \nB.  Policy Reform, ADB\u2019s Value Addition, and Sustainability \n \n18.  Government\u2019s reform agenda. The government\u2019s strong energy sector reform agenda \nis supported by several development partners. Georgia\u2019s Parliament adopted an energy sector \npolicy to support (i) diversification and utilization of renewable generation to fully meet the \ndomestic demand for electricity, (ii) Georgia\u2019s emergence as a regional platform for generation \nand trade of clean energy, (iii) strengthening of regional transmission connectivity and trade, and \n(iv) gradual harmonization with the EU\u2019s third energy package.16 In April 2017, Parliament ratified \nthe accession agreement to the EEC and the country\u2019s subsequent membership in the EEC. The \nmembership framework requires that the government, in compliance with EU\u2019s third energy \npackage, align its energy market with the EU\u2019s best practices, including (i) adoption of legislation \nrelating to electricity tariffs; and (ii) establishment of a competitive electricity and gas market, \nenergy efficiency standards, and energy-related environmental standards. \n \n19.  Parliament has subsequently adopted legislation in compliance with the EU\u2019s third energy \npackage, including the (i) Law on Energy and Water Supply (adopted in December 2019), \n(ii) Electricity Market concept design (adopted in April 2020), (iii) Energy Efficiency Law (adopted \nin May 2020), (iv) National Energy Efficiency Action Plan, (v) Energy Efficiency Labelling Law \n(adopted in December 2019), and (vi) Law on Promoting the Production and Use of Energy from \nRenewable Sources (adopted in December 2019). \n \n20.  ADB conducted a sector assessment in 2019 to identify areas that would affect energy \nsector sustainability; the assessment supported the reforms but highlighted underlying issues that \nstate-owned transmission companies in Georgia face that could affect the government\u2019s broader \nreform agenda: limited access to financial resources, continuous reliance on government support, \n \n \n15 ADB. 2018.

Success of the ongoing mega reforms, \nincluding market competition and supply security, cannot be achieved without a sound and well-\ngoverned transmission network. To ensure success of the broader reforms and reduce reliance \non government budgetary support, the ADB-financed program focuses on electricity transmission \nreforms in three key areas: (i) operational structure and efficiency improvements, (ii) corporate \ngovernance  and  institutional  environment  strengthening,  and  (iii)  financial  sustainability \nimprovements. The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and supports operational \npriorities to accelerate progress in gender equality, strengthen governance and institutional \ncapacity, and foster regional cooperation and integration.17 The program is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry  operations  business  plan,  2019\u20132021,18 and  supports  the  government\u2019s  goals  of \nachieving energy sector reforms, enhancing cross-border electricity trading, and improving the \nefficiency of the transmission network, as reflected in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nGeorgia, 2019\u20132023.19 \n \n21.  Reform area 1: Transmission sector operational structure and efficiency improved. \nThe objective of the reform is to improve operational and network efficiency through essential \nstructural changes. Georgia\u2019s Cabinet of Ministers approved a plan to merge GSE with its \nsubsidiary EnergoTrans and transfer shareholding from the Partnership Fund to the National \nAgency of State Property (NASP).20 The merger is expected to enhance GSE\u2019s operational and \nfinancial efficiency, and the transfer of shareholding to NASP will ensure that retained earnings \nfrom GSE will be used for transmission network infrastructure development rather than for non-\ncore business-related commercial activities. The merger is likewise expected to strengthen \nintegrated planning, management and operations and will support financial resource-sharing \nbetween the two entities. Accordingly, in compliance with Cabinet\u2019s decision, GSE has been \nmerged with Energotrans in January 2021 and the transfer of shareholding from the Partnership \nFund to NASP has been implemented and registered with the Public Registrar in April 2020. \n \n22.  Reform area 2: Georgian State Electrosystem corporate governance strengthened. \nThe reform objective involves transforming GSE into a modern corporate entity with enhanced \ngovernance  and  management  controls.  The  government  has  approved  an  independent \nsupervisory board and a new company charter, in line with the guidelines of the Organization for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development on SOE corporate governance. The supervisory board \nincludes 40% representation by women and consists of independent board members. The \ncompany management and the supervisory board committees on audit, risk, nomination, and \ninvestment have been appointed. To establish GSE\u2019s corporate integrity through performance \nmonitoring and improved governance, the supervisory board adopted codes and frameworks \nbased on international best practices and local laws, including: (i) a corporate governance code; \n(ii) code of ethics and conduct; (iii) a risk management policy framework; (iv) a framework for \nmanagement by performance; and (v) financial, operational, and governance key performance \nindicators. Similarly, to enhance financial controls, reporting, and disclosure requirements at GSE, \nthe supervisory board has notified direct reporting of an independent internal auditor and has \nadopted reporting and disclosure requirements and procedures. These codes, frameworks, and \n \n \n17 ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n18 ADB. 2018.

It lacks a mandate for state asset share management (i.e., performance control \nor investment decisions). NASP is the designated agency for managing state property and has the expertise and \nskills to monitor SOE performance. \n ", "7 \nguidelines  will  provide  the  necessary  governance  and  management  controls  to  ensure \noperational, monitoring, reporting, and disclosure standards in accordance with international best \npractices. GSE also approved a strategy to provide training and internships to promote female \ntechnical workers in the energy sector. \n \n23.  Reform area 3: Georgian State Electrosystem financial management, transparency, \nand debt sustainability improved. The objective of the reform is to make GSE financially \nsustainable and resilient to external shocks. To ensure financial sustainability, the government \nhas taken measures to enhance GSE\u2019s investment planning, debt management capacity, and \nresilience to external shocks through capitalization and increased revenue generation. To bring \nGSE out of insolvency proceedings, the court terminated the rehabilitation period after the MOF\u2019s \napproval of the revised rehabilitation plan and settlement of payments with the creditors. To \nenable EnergoTrans to generate enough revenues to repay its loan obligations, an amendment \nto the energy law to allow inclusion of transmission investments for cross-border trading into RAB \nwas adopted by the Parliament. GNERG has confirmed that, with approval of the energy law \namendment, an increased tariff with enhanced RAB can be provided to EnergoTrans, which will \nimprove its revenues and debt repayment capacity. \n \n24.  GSE\u2019s supervisory board has approved the company\u2019s debt management strategy to \nensure sound financial judgment in the issuance and management of debt. The Cabinet of \nMinisters approved a financial restructuring plan for a consolidated GSE with various measures\u2014 \nsuch as a combination of a debt-to-equity swap, tariff increases, and equity infusion\u2014to enable it \nto meet a required current ratio of 1 and debt-to-equity ratio of 3:1 by financial year 2022. This \nplan includes annual targets and provides multiple options for consideration for meeting these \ntargets. To mitigate foreign exchange risk, the Cabinet of Ministers also approved a foreign \nexchange risk mitigation plan consistent with the national debt management strategy,21 which \nincludes three key initiatives: (i) the MOF will prioritize funding future GSE investments using local \ncurrency financing, (ii) seek equity investments in GSE through an initial public offering, and \n(iii) the MOF will participate in GSE\u2019s investment discussions to ensure that a rationalized \napproach is followed by balancing investment returns with associated project risk and financing \nstructure. \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s  contribution  to  the  program.  ADB  used  its  experience  in  designing  and \nimplementing PBLs in the region to provide advice and technical support to help the government \nsuccessfully develop and implement the program. Experience and knowledge of the regional \nelectricity market, and earlier work on ADB\u2019s Regional Power Transmission Enhancement Project \nin Georgia contributed to effective program design and delivery, with a focus on ensuring \noperational and financial sustainability of the transmission SOEs. 22 ADB\u2019s project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (TA) for the Georgian State Electrosystem Corporatization and Electricity \nMarket Reforms Program provided complementary assistance to enhance the government\u2019s \npolicy delivery capacity.23 A number of experts engaged under the TA provided key inputs in \ndeveloping the GSE\u2019s proposed corporate structure and associated legal and policy documents, \ncorporate codes, action plans, and strategies. \n \n \n \n21 Government of Georgia, Ministry of Finance. 2019.

Development partners in Georgia actively support \nreforms and complement and support each other\u2019s efforts to achieve the government\u2019s reform \nagenda and investment needs through different technical and financial assistance initiatives. The \nsupport includes funding for infrastructure development, TA for implementation of reforms, and \nbudgetary support to meet the developing needs of the country. The Ministry of Economy and \nSustainable  Development  monitors  sequencing  of  energy  sector  reforms  and  coordinates \nactivities among development partners that complement or build upon such assistance. This \ncoordinated  support  includes  assistance  provided  by  (i)  German  development  cooperation \nthrough KfW, which through a policy loan based on a 4-year trigger matrix is supporting reforms \nin the areas of energy market development, liberalization, and energy efficiency; (ii) the IMF, \nwhich through their economic reform program supported by a 3-year extended arrangement under \nan extended fund facility is supporting reforms relating to Georgia\u2019s fiscal risk, public debt \nsustainability, and contingent liabilities; (iii) the EEC, which through its TA program is supporting \nthe development of legal and regulatory policy documents required for fulfilling obligations under \nthe EU\u2019s third energy package; (iv) Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), which is \ncofinancing the KfW program loan and assisting in evaluating the social impact of the market \nreforms  on  the  vulnerable  population;  and  (v)  the  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment, which is providing a TA grant for conducting numerous studies including regulatory \nimpact assessment of the newly approved energy and water laws. The World Bank and KfW have \nongoing projects for developing transmission infrastructure and gas storage. ADB consulted with \nkey sector stakeholders (AFD, the IMF, KfW, and the World Bank) throughout the program design. \n \n27.  Coordination with the International Monetary Fund. In December 2019, the IMF and \nthe government agreed to an extension of the Extended Fund Facility until April 2021. ADB has \nliaised consistently with the IMF from program design to implementation and has agreed to \ncoordinate and provide technical support in the energy sector for the IMF\u2019s program. The IMF \nwelcomes ADB\u2019s financial support to Georgia, which will help prevent the accumulation of more \nonerous financing. The assessment letter from the IMF24 confirms that the program would not \nworsen the country\u2019s debt sustainability situation. \n \n28.   Program\u2019s alignment with other reforms and ADB\u2019s future policy engagement. \nADB\u2019s policy-based program is in line with the government\u2019s state policy for the energy sector \n(footnote 16) and its commitments under the EEC accession agreement. AFD, the EU, and KfW \nare focusing on the establishment of an electricity market. ADB is complementing their efforts by \nsupporting the sustainability and security of electricity transmission companies, while the IMF has \nhighlighted SOEs as a key burden requiring government borrowing and subsidies. To complement \nthe efforts of other development partners, ADB\u2019s policy program is focusing on improving the \nfinancial and corporate governance of two energy sector SOEs, which are among the six top \ncontributors to government debt. To ensure the continuity of corporate governance reforms, ADB \nand  the  authorities  agreed  on  a  PPEF,  which  will  (i)  help  maintain  the  momentum  and \nsustainability of the reforms proposed under this program; and (ii) help the government, in \nconsultation with development partners, conduct another sector assessment following structural \nchanges resulting from establishment of the electricity market in order to prepare proposals for \nfuture reforms. The PPEF will ensure (i) the continuity and sustainability of the proposed reforms, \nand (ii) that ADB\u2019s planned sector development program in 2022 synergizes future reforms with \nthose of other development partners.25  \n \n \n24 International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 For 2022, the Promoting Policies and Investments to Developing New Technologies Sector Development Program \nis included in ADB\u2019s draft country operations business plan for Georgia, 2021\u20132023. \n ", "9 \nC.  Expected Outcome of the Reforms \n \n29.  The program is aligned with the following overarching development objectives: financial \nsustainability and performance of the energy sector improved (footnote 16). The program will \nhave the following effects: GSE autonomy and financial performance enhanced.26 The program \nis  structured  around  three  reform  areas:  (i)  transmission  sector  operational  structure  and \nefficiency; (ii) GSE corporate governance; and (iii) GSE financial management, transparency, and \ndebt sustainability. The program has ten policy actions, which the government implemented \nbetween April 2020 and August 2021. \n \n30.  The economic benefits emanate from energy consumption. When reliable electricity is \nmade available, it will bring incremental as well as non-incremental benefits. Incremental benefits \narise from additional consumption of electricity by both existing and new customers connected to \nthe national grid, while non-incremental benefits arise from maintaining electricity supply from \nefficient and reliable generation sources. The reforms will also help enhance Georgia\u2019s fiscal \nspace and allow the government to better allocate resources for productive investments. The \nprogram\u2019s implementation will contribute to budgetary headroom estimated at GEL460 million \n(1% of GDP), enabling the government to invest in critical areas, including COVID-19 economic \nrecovery. This will have a significant and positive impact on economic growth and employment. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n31.  According to MOF estimates, the gross financing needs is expected to reach $2.0 billion \nin 2021. This sharp increase in gross financing needs is led by temporary expenditure increases \nunder the COVID-19 response plan of 3.8% of GDP in 2020 and another 2.3% in 2021, combined \nwith tax revenues that declined from 24% to 22% of GDP. The financing gap (unmet financing \nneeds) for 2021 is estimated at $746 million (footnote 5). The financing gap is to be closed \nprimarily through loans and grants from development partners as well as domestic borrowing; \ngovernment deposits are available to weather downside risks, if necessary. Based on the \ncountry\u2019s increased development financing needs, and to provide enough fiscal headroom to \nenable additional development finance for the targeted reforms under the Electricity Transmission \nSector Reforms Program (13.4% of financing gap for 2021), proposed budget support program \nhas been sequenced as part of a broader package of financial assistance from development \npartners. The proposed budget support of ADB will help meet the government\u2019s financing needs \nto prevent adverse social and economic impacts associated with its balance of payments and \nfiscal crises.  \n \n32.  The government has requested a regular loan of \u20ac87,504,000 ($100,000,000 equivalent) \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 15-year \nterm, including a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of \n0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based \non the annuity method with 30% discount factor, the average maturity is 12.1 years, and there is \nno maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \n33.  Debt is sustainable in the medium term. Public debt-to-GDP in Georgia remained stable \n(consistently below 45%) during 2014\u20132019. It then rose sharply from 44.5% of GDP in 2019 to \n60.8% in 2020. The increase in 2020 is largely because of the fiscal stimulus package to mitigate \n \n \n26 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "10 \n \nthe impact of COVID-19, compounded by a decline in tax revenue collection. According to IMF \nprojections, in 2022, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall to 58.2% as one-off spending \nmeasures wane and economic growth recovers; the ratio is expected to reach 51.3% of GDP by \n2026. Financial assistance from ADB, on broadly concessional terms, while providing critical \nbudgetary support to the economy will not add significantly to the annual debt service obligations \nfacing the government and help reduce the debt distress.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n34.  The MOF is the executing agency. A technical team from GSE, the Ministry of Economy \nand Sustainable Development, and the MOF were responsible for implementing the program \nactions and coordination with development partners. Support by experts hired under the TA was \nprovided in developing key documents (footnote 23). The program will be implemented from April \n2019 to December 2021.27 The proceeds of the PBL will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n35.  Safeguards. The program is not expected to have any environmental or social safeguards \nimpacts and will not trigger ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) requirements. It is classified \ncategory  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  Investment \nactivities prohibited under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement will be excluded. No policy action \nis eligible for climate finance and no investment in physical asset that can reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions is to be made under the program. \n \n36.  Poverty and social. While the program will have a broad and nationwide impact on \noperations and services in the energy sector, the policy-based lending is especially crucial during \nthe pandemic and related crises, when the government is making a number of reforms to meet \nthe needs of its citizens, particularly the most vulnerable and poor groups. The government has \nincreased its deficit to address COVID-19\u2019s health and socioeconomic impacts, and in this crisis \nenvironment, the policy-based program will have an indirect impact on poverty reduction and \ninclusive growth and will contribute to meeting the country\u2019s development needs. \n \n37.  Gender. The program is categorized some gender elements. The program will support \nadoption of a strategy that will provide training and internships to women, science, technical, \nengineering, and mathematics students. The program will promote skills development of the \nwomen employed in GSE (30% of the training participants of the implementing agency will be \nwomen) for their career advancement. The program will ensure that 40% of the members of the \nsupervisory board are women; in that role they will be able to participate in decision making and \nplay an important role in integrating a gender and social inclusion perspective in policies and \nprograms that will impact women and other vulnerable groups. \n \n38.  Governance.  Georgia  has  made  considerable  progress  in  improving  the  legal  and \nregulatory framework for public financial management, and the overall fiscal risk to the program \nis low. The country\u2019s public financial management is generally strong, with transparent and well-\nestablished  accounting,  budgeting,  and  auditing  systems.  The  government  has the  correct \nfunctional departments and legal processes in place. Within the MOF, the Treasury is responsible \nfor accounting standards across ministries and other budgetary units, a Financial Risk Division \n \n \n27 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "11 \nanalyzes fiscal risk exposure, the Parliamentary Budget Office delivers a report on the public \nbudget, the Public Internal Control Department harmonizes internal audits across all public \nbudgetary units, and the State Audit Office performs the supreme audit. Despite this functional \nsetup, the Fiscal Risk Division remains understaffed, with limited capacity to undertake regular \nmonitoring and recommendations. All central government departments are required to prepare \nfinancial statements according to the International Public Sector Accounting Standards adopted \nby the MOF. Financial data integrity, compliance, and assurance are centralized and carried out \nby the Treasury for all state entities. In addition, the Treasury validates financial data integrity \ndaily. The MOF monitors unauthorized accounting system access, and internal auditors and the \nState Audit Office conduct audits to verify accuracy and completeness of financial data.28 \n \n39.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 1 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.29 \n \nTable 1: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nContinuation of COVID-19  The risk level continues to be high.

The government also augmented its public \nrevenue.  deficit by increasing its expenditure and borrowings. With the \npublic deficit covered and support provided to vulnerable people, \nthe impact on implementation of financial restructuring plan for \nGSE and its financial sustainability will be limited.  \nWeak debt management, including  A public debt management strategy with a key action plan has \ncontingent liabilities  been developed and approved by the MOF and GSE\u2019s debt \nmanagement strategy has been accordingly aligned with it to \nmitigate the risk to the extent possible.
