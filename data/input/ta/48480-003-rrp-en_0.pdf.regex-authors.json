THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Nauru for the Sustainable and Climate-Resilient Connectivity Project. The report also describes \nthe proposed administration of grants to be provided by the Government of Australia and the \nGreen Climate Fund (GCF) for the project, and if the Board approves the proposed grant, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grants.  \n \n2.  The project will build a climate-resilient port in Nauru, including a wharf, a berth pocket, \nand a breakwater at Aiwo. It will reconstruct port buildings, the container storage area, and port \nsecurity facilities. The project will support institutional reforms to strengthen the Port Authority of \nNauru (PAN) and achieve sound and efficient port governance and management. It will also \nestablish a revolving fund to ensure financially sustainable port operation and maintenance (O&M).  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Fragile economy. Nauru is a single isolated island in the Pacific with a land area of only \n21 square kilometers and a population of 11,288.1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) identifies \nNauru as a country in fragile and conflict-affected situations since 2008.2 Nauru\u2019s economy is \nhighly volatile and based on diminishing phosphate mining, the sale of fishing rights, and a \nregional processing center for migrants seeking asylum in Australia. In the 1970s, Nauru had one \nof the highest rates of national income per capita in the world. By the 1990s, however, the \neconomy had contracted severely as phosphate reserves and mining revenue dried up. The \ngovernment introduced broad fiscal and financial management reforms starting in 2005, and the \neconomy has recovered. Nauru\u2019s gross domestic product grew at an annual average rate of 5% \nin 2015\u20132016.3 The country\u2019s phosphate reserves, its main natural resource, have become nearly \nexhausted, and significant economic uncertainties remain. Nauru urgently needs to upgrade its \ninfrastructure to quickly develop alternative sources of revenue and growth.   \n \n4.  Aiwo Port is the only gateway for essential imports and exports. Nauru is almost \ntotally dependent on maritime transport for its survival. More than 95% of Nauru\u2019s international \ntrade moves by sea. This makes safe and effective maritime port operations critical to meeting its \npeople\u2019s basic needs for fuel, medical supplies, food, and water. Shipping operations in and out \nof Nauru are neither safe, nor effective, nor year-round. Aiwo\u2019s aged port infrastructure is \ndilapidated and was never developed to the standard needed for efficient operations in Nauru\u2019s \nchallenging maritime environment. This and the increasingly worsening ocean conditions at Nauru \nnow make the port frequently inoperable, with shutdowns often lasting weeks at a time. Nauru is \nplagued by regular fuel, electricity, food, and water shortages. The port\u2019s deficiencies drive up \nshipping rates and the country\u2019s overall basic costs of living. The education and health sectors \nsuffer from chronic supply shortages. Rates of lifestyle disease (diabetes and obesity) are among \n                                                 \n1   Government of Nauru, National Bureau of Statistics. http://nauru.prism.spc.int (assessed 2015). This does not \ninclude about 1,200 residents of the government\u2019s regional refugee processing center. \n2  ADB. 2012.

About a quarter of the population lives below the country\u2019s basic-needs \npoverty line.4 \n \n5.  Inoperability and dangers of the current port facilities and operations. The existing \nAiwo Port consists of a small boat harbor built in 1907, an offshore anchorage and mooring \nsystem, a container yard, and the PAN buildings.5 It cannot accommodate oceangoing containers \nand cargo ships, which are forced to load and unload their cargoes beyond the fringing reef in \ndeep open waters. All cargo and container transfers onto and off the vulnerable pusher barges \nthat run back and forth between the vessels and the boat harbor dock are done manually. This is \ndifficult, time-consuming, and dangerous to crews and vessels. Fuel, freight, and demurrage costs \nare far higher than they should be because each loading and unloading takes an average of 21 \ndays to complete. \n \n6.  The cargo transfers on the open sea and safe transit for the small barges are impossible \nwhen the weather and the speed and direction of wind are unfavorable. The mooring system \nmeant to secure ocean ships offshore is often damaged during harsh conditions and out of \noperation for months until costly repairs can be done. This means visiting ships must offload while \nadrift on the ocean near the reef.6 When the sea is too rough, work stops. The port must shut \ndown completely for 3 months a year. \n \n7.  The existing port buildings are in danger of collapse, contain asbestos, pose serious safety \nrisks for PAN workers, have capacity limitations, and do not comply with International Ship and \nPort Facility Security requirements.7  \n \n8.  PAN faces multiple port management challenges. The port operations are not financially \nviable. Tariff levels do not reflect the cost of delivering the services the port provides. PAN lacks \ntechnical and managerial capacity and formal management systems.  \n \n9.  Port vulnerabilities intensifying with climate change. Aiwo is extremely exposed to \nwesterly winds. Use of the small barges to ferry cargo and containers in and out of the shallow \nboat harbor has become more and more difficult, dangerous, and prone to prolonged delays and \nshutdowns. Climate analysis and PAN records show that westerly waves of more than 2 meters \nin height, which disrupt port operations offshore for at least 3 months a year, have become more \nfrequent. Westerly waves and swells are driven by the El Ni\u0148o Southern Oscillation, the South \nPacific Convergence Zone, the Western Pacific Monsoon, and distant tropical cyclonic activities. \nA climate risk and vulnerability assessment indicates significant risks that climate change will \nintensify the effects of these climate drivers.8 Worsening waves, winds, and long-range cyclones, \nalong with rising sea levels, will make the current port facilities inoperable for longer periods every \nyear in the future.   \n \n                                                 \n4  Government of Nauru. 2013.

The \nsmall walled harbor on the east coast at Anibare is used mainly by fishing vessels, although containers are sometimes \nferried into its dock from offshore ships when operations at Aiwo are shut down by seasonal heavy seas on the \nwestern side of the island. Port development at Anibare has been discounted because the (i) area is exposed to \ntrade winds and wave climate for about 9 months of the year; (ii) the subsea geology comprises a submarine landslip, \npresenting a significant risk that further subsea instability may severely damage new port infrastructure; (iii) the reef \nand marine ecosystem around and within Anibare Bay is relatively pristine, and any port development would place \nthis ecosystem at high risk of irreversible damage. \n6  Maintenance of the mooring system costs the government an average of A$1 million a year.  \n7   International Maritime Organization. 2003.

Nauru\u2019s sea link shrinking and imperiled. Historically, two shipping lines\u2014Neptune and \nMatson  Shipping\u2014have  served  Nauru.  In  November  2015,  the  chronic  delays,  technical \nchallenges, added expense, and risks of using the inadequate, unprotected port at Aiwo led \nMatson Shipping to suspend its service to the country. This has left Neptune the only shipping \ncompany still willing to operate in Nauru. Dependence on a single line increases the country\u2019s \nshipping costs, consumer prices, and vulnerability. With climatic, weather, and sea conditions at \nAiwo expected to worsen, the risk that Neptune Shipping will also withdraw its vessels one day is \nhigh. This would force the government to charter ships at even higher costs simply to keep \nNauru\u2019s lifeline open. \n \n11.  In 2010\u20132012, an average of 19 container vessels and eight fuel ships visited Nauru each \nyear. During this period, the port handled an annual average of 1,415 twenty-foot equivalent units \nof container shipments and 18 phosphate ships. In 2013, after the regional processing center for \nasylum seekers reopened, container ship arrivals rose significantly from 18 to 32, and the \ncontainer shipment volume more than doubled to 2,856 twenty-foot equivalent units. Ship arrivals \ndropped in 2016 after Matson Shipping withdrew its services (para. 10). If current port conditions \npersist, the decline in ship visits and container volume is projected to continue. But once the \nproposed project completes the improvement of port facilities and reforms of port operations, pre-\n2012 levels are expected to be restored and possibly surpassed by 2020.  \n \n12.  Options studied for improving the port. Nauru\u2019s geography is uniquely hostile to \nmaritime  shipping  and  offers  few  options  for  developing  adequate  berthing  facilities  for \noceangoing ships. It has no natural harbor, and the seabed drops sharply just beyond the \nsurrounding reef, reaching 3,000 meters (or 3 kilometers) in depth within 7 kilometers of the \ncoastline. Alternatives for the design of a protected port are further limited by the westerly waves \nand swells at Aiwo (para. 9). Several organizations conducted studies on the best way to provide \nNauru with an efficient, effective, and reliable port\u2014ADB in 2009,9 the Japan International \nCooperation Agency in 2014,10 and the Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility in 2015 (footnote 5). \nADB performed two additional studies for the project in 2015\u20132017.11 Together, these studies \nexplored 21 designs and exhausted virtually every technically feasible option. The proposed \nproject design includes the construction of a 170-meter-long, 30-meter-wide wharf adjacent to a \n50-meter-wide berth pocket dredged into the reef; a breakwater about 140 meters long; and port \nbuilding and security facilities. The design is technically feasible, complies with International Ship \nand Port Facility Security requirements, and ensures climate resilience. This is also the least-cost \noption. \n \n13.  Readiness for implementation. The project is at a high level of implementation readiness. \nThe due diligence was completed with project preparatory transaction technical assistance (TA) \n(footnote 11). ADB\u2019s project design advance (PDA) prepared the detailed engineering design and \nbidding documents (footnote 11). The project preparatory TA completed a detailed assessment \nof the needs for institutional strengthening and capacity building (port reforms) at PAN. The \nGovernment of Australia has already provided a A$3.3 million grant to support the port reforms, \nwhich will be implemented under the TA (footnote 11).  \n \n14.  Value added by ADB assistance. ADB led the efforts by Nauru\u2019s development partners \nto help the government achieve its critical goal of developing Aiwo Port.

ADB has been instrumental in designing the reforms to restructure PAN (para. 24). It also \nspearheaded the work to set up a revolving O&M fund to ensure that port operations and \nmaintenance of the new assets are sustainable beyond project completion (para. 25).  \n \n15.  The project promotes poverty reduction, inclusive economic growth, climate resilience, \nand infrastructure development in a small state facing fragile and conflict-affected situations. This \nis consistent with the government\u2019s priorities12 and aligned with ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2016\u2013\n2020.13 The project is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.14 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n16.  The project is aligned with the following impact: sustainability and quality of life of all \nNauruans improved.15 The project will have the following outcome: efficiency, reliability, and \nclimate resilience of Aiwo Port improved.16   \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n17.  Output 1: Climate-proofed port infrastructure constructed. The project will construct \nnew port infrastructure, including a wharf, a berth pocket, and a breakwater. It will also reconstruct \nport buildings, the container storage area, and port security facilities.  \n \n18.  Output 2: Sustainable operations and maintenance achieved. Supported by the \nongoing TA, the government will set up a revolving fund to be used exclusively to finance the \nmaintenance of the assets constructed under the project.17 The fund will be built initially to cover \n3 years of maintenance costs. It will be financed by port revenue and government budget \nallocations. The government contribution will decline over time as the port, supported by reforms, \ngradually achieves positive operating net income. This is expected by June 2021 (paras. 25 and \n30.  \n \n19.  Output 3: Efficient port operations established. Under the ongoing TA, the government \nand PAN will carry out port reforms, including institutional strengthening, capacity development, \ntariff restructuring, and the engagement of the private sector in port operations and management \n(para. 24).  \n \nD.

Climate change adaptation costs. Of the overall $79.59 million project costs, the cost of \nclimate change adaptation is estimated to be $54.87 million. This cost is calculated as the \ndifference between the costs of the port development options with and without climate resilience. \nThe  without-climate  resilience  option  involves  strengthening  the  existing  open-sea  mooring \nsystem. The with-climate resilience option involves the breakwater, dredging to enable ships to \nsafely enter and berth in the calmer waters that the breakwater will protect, and a wharf for loading \n ", "6 \n \nand unloading. The selected option is the most cost-effective of the feasible alternatives for \nproviding climate resilience. The GCF will fund about half of the adaptation costs (49%).  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  A project steering committee comprising representatives of line ministries and chaired by \nthe secretary, Ministry of Finance (MOF) will provide overall oversight. MOF will be the executing \nagency, and PAN the implementing agency. A project management unit (PMU) to be established \nwill include PAN staff and supervision consultants. PAN\u2019s chief executive officer, to be recruited \ninternationally, will be responsible for the project\u2019s supervision and day-to-day implementation, \nincluding financial management, monitoring, and evaluation. The PMU will maintain separate \naccounts for the project, which will be audited by an independent auditor. The PMU will be \nresponsible for procuring the civil works contract under ADB oversight. The government has \ndelegated the selection of supervision consultants to ADB.  \n \n24.  The project team will carry out the port reforms under the ongoing TA alongside project \nimplementation (footnote 11). The reforms will strengthen PAN, introduce legislative amendments \nfor organizational and port tariff restructuring, create an effective asset management system, \nestablish a revolving fund for O&M, and engage a private sector port operator to ensure long-term \nsustainability of assets. The government will implement the reforms from 1 January 2018 to 31 \nDecember 2022.    \n \n25.  The government will set up and maintain the revolving fund for port maintenance during \nthe implementation of port reforms from 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2023. Since Nauru\u2019s banking \nsystem consists of a single banking agency, the fund will likely be deposited in a bank in Australia. \nIt will be used as the new port becomes operational by June 2020 and replenished annually to \nensure that it can cover 3 years of maintenance costs. The implementation arrangements are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements\nImplementation period  January 2018\u2013December 2022\nEstimated completion date   31 December 2022\nEstimated grant closing date  30 June2023\nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Project steering committee \n(i)  Secretary, Ministry of Finance (chair) \n(ii)  Chairman, Port Authority of Nauru (member) \n(iii)  Secretary, Ministry of Transport (member) \n(iv)  Advisor to the Ministry of Finance (member) \n(v)  Chief executive officer, Port Authority of Nauru (member) \n(vi)  Chief executive officer, Ronphos Corporation (member) \n(vii)  Eigigu Holdings Corporation, representing the private sector \n(member) \n(viii) Team leader, mooring task force(member) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Finance\n(iii)  Implementing agency  Port Authorityof Nauru\n(iv)  Implementation unit  Project management unitunderthe Port Authority of Nauru  \nProcurement  International competitive bidding 1 contract $66.09milliona\nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection  81 person- $1.5 million \n(supervision consultants)  (90:10) months \n ", "7 \n \nAspects  Arrangements\nRetroactive financing and/or  Retroactive financing for the reimbursement of eligible expenditures \nadvance contractingb  incurred under the project before the effective date of the grant \nagreements, up to a maximum amount equivalent to 20% of each \ngrant amount.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n26.  Design features. The project team, through the TA and PDA, assessed all the technically \nfeasible  options.  These  assessments  included  wave  analysis;  the  testing  of  infrastructure \nconfigurations  through  ship  simulation  modeling;  geotechnical  investigations;  topographic, \ncadastral, and bathymetric surveys; and an assessment of the presence of unexploded ordnance \nwithin the proposed development footprint. The project team closely considered construction \nissues, wave climate and climate change impacts, berthing availability, and wharf orientation. The \nbreakwater, wharf, foreshore port buildings, and container yard have been designed for greater \nheights to withstand projected rises in sea levels and increasing severity and frequency of waves. \nThese design features add to the project\u2019s climate resilience and economic viability.     \n \n27.  Climate change adaptation measures. The project\u2019s main climate change adaptation \nmeasures\u2014dredging a berthing pocket and constructing the wharf and breakwater\u2014will cost \n$54.87 million. Of this, the GCF is providing $26.91 million in grant cofinancing. These measures \nwill enable oceangoing vessels serving Nauru to berth in an area protected from climatic hazards \nand climate change effects, and to transfer cargo and containers directly to and from land \nalongside a sheltered wharf.  \n \n28.  Climate change mitigation measures. Climate change mitigation will be achieved by \nreducing the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO ) Once the project \n2 .\nis completed, fuel-powered pusher barges will no longer be needed to ferry shipments to and from \nvessels offshore. The average berthing stay of a container ship is expected to decline from about \n21 days to 3 days once the new facilities are built. Fuel ship berthing should be cut to 1 day on \naverage from the current 4 days. Shorter berthing periods and elimination of the need for \nmotorized barges will significantly reduce the fuel consumed by port operations and cut emissions \nby an estimated 10,708 tons of CO a year. Because ship visits are expected to marginally \n2 \nincrease (para. 11), theproject is projected to reduce CO  emissions by about 500,000 tons over \n  2\nits 50-year economic lifetime.  \n \n ", "8 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n29.  The project\u2019s primary quantifiable benefits are (i) savings in time and operating costs for \nvisiting cargo and fuel vessels, (ii) costs saved by eliminating the need for pusher barges to ferry \ncargo, (iii) savings afforded by eliminating the need to charter shipping vessels to keep the \nmaritime lifeline open, (iv) reduced port operation costs thanks to shorter berthing periods per \nvessel, and (v) savings from climate change mitigation thanks to reduced greenhouse gas \nemissions. The project is economically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return \nof 9.4%. A sensitivity analysis applying a worst-case scenario of a 10% drop in benefits and a \n10% rise in construction costs from the baseline case shows that the project would still yield an \neconomic internal rate of return of 7.3%. This would be acceptable given the project\u2019s substantial \nunquantified benefits, including a reduction in damage to perishable imports, increase in safety \nand security at the port (fewer accidents), and social benefits.     \n \n30.  The project is financially viable with an estimated financial internal rate of return of 2.9%, \nwhich is higher than the weighted average cost of capital of 1.3%. This assumes, however, a \nsubstantial increase in the port handling tariff, as approved by the government. The introduction \nof  higher  tariffs  underwent  intensive  stakeholder  consultations.  In  November  2017,  the \ngovernment gazetted the law to increase the tariffs. Therefore, the risk of not implementing the \ntariff increase is moderate. Nevertheless, to mitigate the risks and ensure financial sustainability, \nthe government agreed to set up a dedicated maintenance fund earmarked from its budget from \n1 July 2018. This fund will fully cover port operations and maintenance if the project does not \ngenerate sufficient revenue (para. 18). The port reforms will recommend appropriate management \nof any accumulated funds generated from the port tariffs.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n31.  Reforms for efficiency and sustainability. The project will support comprehensive \nreforms to improve the port\u2019s performance and secure its long-term sustainability (para. 24). Once \nthe new port is operational, the government will engage a qualified private sector operator to run \nthe port. This will reduce operating costs and improve port efficiency.  \n \n32.  Financial management risks and mitigation measures. The financial management risk \nis rated high at PAN. This is mainly because of PAN\u2019s lack of experience in managing externally \nfunded projects. Among other things, the mitigation measures supported by the TA will (i) \nstrengthen PAN institutionally and develop its capacity; (ii) establish a financial management \ninformation system and accounting procedures; (iii) ensure the adoption of an asset management \nand maintenance plan, and the establishment of the revolving maintenance fund; (iv) draft \nlegislative amendments for organizational and tariff restructuring and regulations to be passed by \n31 December 2019; (v) engage experienced international experts for key positions in PAN; and \n(vi) provide on-the-job and overseas training for PAN staff.  \n \n33.  Procurement and implementation risks and mitigation measures. ADB will disburse \nfunds directly to contractors, consultants, and suppliers engaged by the project, which now boasts \nhigh  procurement  readiness  thanks  to  PDA  support  (para.  13).  ADB  will  supervise  the \nprocurement of works and goods and the selection of consultants. It will closely monitor the \nperformance of contractors, consultants, and suppliers. PAN will prepare regular financial reports \nand engage an external auditor acceptable to ADB to prepare annual audited financial statements. \nAll project-related expenses will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n ", "9 \n \n34.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, MOF, and PAN. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM.  \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n35.  The project will benefit the entire Nauru population. A reliable year-round port will provide \naccess to essential imported goods that are now increasingly difficult and expensive for the \ncountry to obtain. These include staple goods; fresh produce and more nutritious foods; medicines \nand medical supplies (which are now often delayed, damaged, or lost in transit); and education \nmaterials and equipment. As maritime freight costs decline, the quarter of the population currently \nliving below the basic-needs poverty line will be able to better afford consumer goods.  \n \n36.  The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. PAN currently employs only \nthree women on its staff of 60. PAN will implement a gender action plan that will significantly boost \nparticipation by women and contribute to their economic empowerment. The plan sets minimum \ntargets for female participation in community consultations, project committees, PAN\u2019s skilled and \nunskilled workforce, training for communities, and on the PMU staff.    \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n37.   In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.19 \n \n38.  Environment (category B). The initial environmental examination confirms that the \nproject will have no significant impacts on the environment since it will be undertaken largely \nwithin  the  footprint  of  the  existing  port  facilities.  The  project  team  has  updated  the  initial \nenvironmental examination, including the environmental management plan (EMP), based on the \ndetailed design. The project will not impact any endemic, endangered, or significant marine or \nterrestrial biodiversity and will not affect freshwater, forests, and agriculture. Impacts on the \nterrestrial and shallow water marine ecosystems and their environments are expected to be minor \nand can be managed through mitigation measures. The EMP will guide the contractor in preparing \nthe construction EMP, which must be reviewed and cleared by the PMU and ADB before physical \nactivities begin. \n \n39.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The project will be implemented within the \nexisting port land parcel, which the government has been leasing since 1907. The project will not \nresult  in  physical  or  economic  displacement  or  involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  team \nprepared a due diligence report to confirm land ownership and ensure that the land lease and \narrangements comply with government laws and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. All the key \nstakeholders have been consulted and will continue to be consulted during implementation.  \n \n40.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No indigenous peoples live on the island who can be \ndefined as distinct and vulnerable. \n \n                                                 \n19  ADB.
