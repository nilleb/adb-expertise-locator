The Government of the Fiji Islands recognizes that economic diversification and an \nimproved business environment are required to address the country\u2019s economic challenges, \nincluding  post-coup  recovery  and  structural  changes.  The  Government  has,  therefore, \ncommitted to implementing private-sector-friendly policies and structural reforms, as reflected in \nthe Government\u2019s medium-term Strategic Development Plan (SDP) 2003\u20132005 and reiterated in \nthe 2005 and 2006 budget statements. \n \n2.   In response, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) initiated in 2004 the preparation of a \nprivate sector assessment (PSA) for the Fiji Islands1 with a view toward (i) identifying and \nassessing the major issues impeding private sector growth; (ii) stimulating discussion on these \nissues and commensurate solutions among government officials, the private sector, and the \ngeneral public; (iii) providing a broad reform framework as a basis for relevant government \npolicies, strategies, and decision making; and (iv) informing ADB\u2019s country assistance strategy \nand program. The PSA emphasizes the central role of the private sector in promoting the rapid \neconomic growth that the Fiji Islands needs in order to create employment and prosperity. It \nrecognizes recent government initiatives as important first steps in reforming the business \nenvironment. It suggests ways in which this momentum can be sustained and further progress \nassured. It points out several factors that could promote enterprise, investment, and economic \ngrowth. \n \n3.  A series of extensive consultations on the draft PSA2 led to presentations of the final \nPSA to senior government leaders, including the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, the \nCabinet Subcommittee for Investment, a development subcommittee comprising all Government \nChief Executive Officers, and other senior government officials. The Government endorsed the \nmain thrust of the PSA and requested that ADB assist further by formulating detailed, prioritized, \nand sequenced private sector development (PSD) reform roadmaps and action plans to help \ntranslate  the  priority  reform  areas  identified by  the  PSA  into  reform  action.  The  proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) will support the Government in achieving this goal. \n \n4.  The  TA  design  was  agreed  upon  with  the  Government  in  October  2005.  The \nGovernment agrees with the proposed project framework, implementation arrangements, costs \nand financing arrangements, and outline terms of reference. The TA framework is in Appendix \n1.3\n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Political and economic uncertainties in the Fiji Islands have created an environment of \nminimal business confidence. The economy is growing too slowly to generate jobs and reduce \npoverty. Annual economic growth rates have averaged 2.3%. Investment has hovered around \n12% of gross domestic product (GDP) over the past 20 years. The Fiji Islands\u2019 exceptionally \nhigh economic growth rate of 9.2% in 1999 was reversed by political uncertainty associated with \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Private Sector Assessment for Fiji Islands: Promise Unfulfilled. Manila/Sydney (Consultant report; \nJuly).  \n2  ADB missions visited Suva, the Fiji Islands, in October 2004, March 2005, April 2005, and June 2005 for fact-\nfinding and comprehensive consultations on the PSA findings and recommendations, options to translate the \nrecommendations into reform action, and broader PSD policy dialogue with government, private sector, donors, \nacademe, and the general public. The PSD consultations were closely linked to the process leading to the \nformulation of ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for the Fiji Islands. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 12 August 2005.  \n ", "2   \nthe 2000 coup d\u2019etat, which resulted in GDP contracting 2.8%. While aggregate growth has \npicked up since then, driven especially by tourism and construction, current projections forecast \ndeclining growth for the coming years. Total investment in the country is currently around 16% \nof  GDP  (with  private  investment  accounting  for  just  over  4%  of  GDP),  well  below  the \nGovernment\u2019s target investment rate of 25%. In addition, the Fiji Islands is going through a \ndifficult  phase  of  structural  change,  with  sugar  and  garments\u2014two  major,  labor  intensive \nindustries\u2014facing eroding tariff preferences. This is likely to result in major job losses and \nexacerbate the trends of rapid urbanization and increasing poverty. Infrastructure is generally \npoor,  while  services  like  telecommunications,  port  handling,  and  air  transportation  are \nexpensive. This undermines the Fiji islands\u2019 competitive position and distances the country even \nfurther from international markets. The legal and financial systems are costly to access and use, \nand nominal tax rates on companies are high, especially in light of the low quality of basic \nservices delivered. The regulatory system is burdensome and lacks a compensating public \npolicy objective. As a result, the cost and time involved in starting up, operating, and closing \ndown business is substantial. Rural entrepreneurs suffer disproportionately from this distorted, \ncostly operating environment. \n \n6.  The Government\u2019s Medium Term Strategic Development Plan 2003\u201320054 provides a \npolitical and social foundation for sustained economic development and poverty reduction. It \nincludes 12 strategic priorities, five of which are orientated toward rebuilding confidence in the \neconomy, including maintaining macroeconomic stability, raising investment levels, reforming \nthe public sector to reduce the cost of doing business; developing rural and outer-island areas; \nand promoting competition and efficiency through structural reforms. The mid-term review of the \nSDP, published in November 2004,5 recognized that despite improvements in economic growth \nand private sector investment since 2000, substantial reform measures are still required in (i) \nthe public sector (especially in the areas of financial management, increased public\u2013private \npartnerships, and the privatization and corporatization of state-owned enterprises); and (ii) the \nprivate sector (especially in the area of improved private sector productivity through reduction in \nbusiness transactions costs and distortions). The successor SDP, likely to be released after the \ngeneral elections in the second half of 2006, is expected to largely preserve the structure and \napproach of the original SDP, albeit with the adoption of a number of new initiatives. However, \nthe Government\u2019s policy focus on PSD has, by and large, not been matched by the necessary \nreform measures. This has partly been due to stretched Government capacity in the analysis of \nunderlying issues, and partly due to the Government's limited experience with PSD reform. \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s PSA aims to start filling that gap. Based on a survey of businesses in the Fiji \nIslands, and a review of the existing private sector environment, it recommends the following \npriorities for PSD in the Fiji Islands:6 (i) improve access to finance and further develop the \ndomestic  financial  market;7  (ii)  accelerate  state-owned-enterprise  reform;  (iii)  enhance \ninfrastructure  service  provision  through  public\u2013private  partnerships;  (iv)  modernize  the \ncommercial legal and regulatory framework (on the basis of a recent diagnostic report8 on \n                                                 \n4  Government of the Fiji Islands, 2002, Rebuilding Confidence for Stability and Growth for a Peaceful, Prosperous \nFiji, Strategic Development Plan 2003-2005, Parliamentary Paper No. 72 of 2002, November. \n5  National Planning Office, 2004, Strategic Development Plan 2003\u20132005: Mid-Term Review, Ministry of Finance \nand National Planning, November. Material in the Government\u2019s strategy is drawn from the original SDP for 2003\u2013\n2005 and the midterm review. \n6  The full report is available on ADB\u2019s website (http://www.adb.org/documents/Reports/PSA/FIJ/default.asp). \n7  ADB is conducting a diagnostic study of the collateral system in the Fiji Islands (under regional TA No. 6202-REG). \n8  ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n ", "  3\npriorities for reforming the legal business environment); (v) address property rights issues, \nincluding the simplification of procedures to unlock land for productive and economic uses within \na traditional landownership framework; and (vi) improve the tax and incentive system.  \n \n8.  Although initial steps toward reform in some areas have been taken,9 these are not \nbeing implemented as part of a comprehensive framework directed at improving the business \nenvironment. Achieving sustained growth in the longer term will necessitate some fundamental \nchanges in the institutions supporting the Fiji Islands' business environment. Developing and \nmanaging the reform agenda poses a key challenge. Central to this is building understanding of \nthe underlying issues, while engendering confidence in and ownership of the necessary reform \nactivities, among politicians, key government decision makers, the larger bureaucracy, and \nprivate sector-support institutions (such as chambers of commerce). The Fiji Islands\u2019 reform \nchampions, scattered through all levels of the government, private sector, and wider society, \nneed to be identified and consulted. At the same time, public awareness and understanding of \neconomic reform issues needs to be enhanced to underpin public support of the reform process. \n \n9.  The TA will provide more in-depth expert analysis in the PSA reform priority areas, and \nsupport  the  Government  in  formulating  and  packaging  reform  roadmaps  for  private  sector \ndevelopment  in  a  participatory  fashion.  This  assistance  will  be  catalytic  in  initiating  a \ncomprehensive reform process, for which there is currently strong momentum. ADB is well \npositioned to act as an \u201chonest\u201d broker by providing expert advice and helping promote vital \ndialogue, cooperation, and coordination between the public and private sectors, as well as \namong  interested  development  partners.  For  its  part,  the  Government  has  reiterated  its \ncommitment to managing the reform process in a participatory and consultative fashion. It will \nestablish  new  or  use  existing  implementation  mechanisms,  such  as  reform  steering \ncommittee(s),  to  drive  the  reform  design  and  implementation  process,  with  a  view  toward \nminimizing the risks of political interference, bureaucratic inertia, and reform \u201ccynicism\u201d on the \npart of the private sector and civil society. \n \n10.  The proposed TA directly supports implementation of the SDP in its strategic priority \nareas, focusing on private-sector-led economic growth. It is fully consistent with ADB\u2019s private \nsector development strategy10 and ADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy 2005\u20132009,11 which emphasizes \nPSD as a key development pillar for the Pacific Islands. The TA directly supports ADB\u2019s country \nassistance  strategy  for  the  Fiji  Islands,  which  seeks  to  address  private  sector  issues  and \nconstraints. The TA will support ADB\u2019s ongoing and planned PSD-related activities in the Fiji \nIslands  by  ensuring  that  linkages  of  respective  activities  are  effectively  drawn.  Donor \ncooperation, coordination, and harmonization will be proactively promoted. \n \n                                                 \n9  For instance, ADB supported in 2005 the drafting of policy and legal frameworks for public\u2013private partnerships. \nMoreover, ADB provided in early 2005 a diagnostic of the broader legal business environment, and is currently \nexamining problems and solutions concerning the use of collateral to improve access to finance. The Ministry of \nCommerce, Business Development and Investment, with support from Foreign Investment Advisory Services \n(FIAS), has effected amendments to the Foreign Investment Act that move away from regulating the entry of \nforeign investment into the country, and move toward a position of simple registration. This has implications for the \nFiji Islands Trade & Investment Bureau (FTIB), whose focus becomes investment promotion instead of screening \nand  approvals.  The  Ministry  of  Commerce,  Business  Development  and  Investment  is  also  developing  an \ninvestment promotion strategy and is reviewing the investment regulatory processes. With support from FIAS, the \nMinistries and Justice and Commerce have jointly reviewed the system of company registration. A public\u2013private \nregulatory reform task force, chaired by the Ministry of Commerce, Business Development and Investment, is \nguiding these activities with continued FIAS support.  \n10  ADB. 2000.

The expected impact of the TA will be increased private sector activity. Toward this end, \nthe outcome of the TA will be approaches focusing on an improved, more enabling business \nenvironment.  While  the  TA\u2019s  impact  will  depend  largely  on  how  closely  the  Government \nimplements the reform roadmaps, the TA is expected to contribute to improved access to \nfinance, reform of state-owned enterprises, and reform of the legal business environment\u2014\nessential ingredients of an enabling business environment that promotes enterprise, investment, \nand economic growth. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA\u2019s major output will be private sector development reform roadmaps in the areas \nof  financial  market  development,  state-owned-enterprise  reform,  and  the  legal  business \nframework. These roadmaps will directly link to the SDP. Expanding on the analysis of the PSA \nand  supplementary  diagnostic  reports,  the  reform  roadmaps  will  provide  further  in-depth \nanalysis of the priority issues, and incorporate detailed reform action plans and implementation \nmechanisms, including monitorable performance indicators. Seminars and workshops on the \nlarger PSD reform agenda and specific reform priority issues will be held to strengthen the \nreform momentum. \n \n13.  The  TA  is  designed  to  link  both  upstream  and  downstream  components,  through \ndiagnosis, policy dialogue, and communication. The TA will focus on upstream work, through \nanalysis of, and roadmaps on, priority areas identified in the PSA, and the linkage to the SDP. A \ngovernment-driven  participatory  and  consultative  approach  will  be  applied,  including  policy \ndialogue with government and private sector organizations and stakeholders, and consultations \nand seminars on PSD issues and solutions. High-level seminars (and possibly retreats) with key \nstakeholders will be facilitated to ensure understanding of issues, options for solutions, and \nreform ownership. TA findings will be disseminated in various formats, including policy notes \nand media releases. On-the-job training will be provided at both line and coordinating ministries \nto build capacity in the analysis of PSD issues, formulation and prioritization of PSD strategies, \nand design of implementation mechanisms. \n \n14.  The  PSA  will  provide  the  conceptual  and  analytical  basis  for  TA  approaches  and \nactivities. Current diagnostic work undertaken by ADB in the areas of legal reform and collateral \nreform will form an integral part of, and be further promoted by, the TA. The TA will provide \nexpert  advice  in  the  larger  PSA  themes  of  state-owned-enterprise  reform,  financial  sector \ndevelopment, and business law and property rights, as well as other areas closely linked to \nthese themes. The TA will provide some degree of flexibility, with a view to allow responding to \nreform  opportunities  as  they  arise.  The  TA  will  cooperate  closely  with  other  development \npartners,  including  Foreign  Investment  Advisory  Services  (on  administrative  barriers  and \ninvestment incentives), and Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (on tax and incentive \nsystems). The TA will link directly to ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for the Fiji Islands by \ntaking  into  account  ongoing  or  recent  projects,  and  by  feeding  into\u2014thereby  leveraging\u2014 \ninitiatives in the pipeline. \n \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $430,000 equivalent, comprising $258,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $172,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  provide  $258,000 \nequivalent to finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $42,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nGovernment of the Fiji Islands will finance the remaining $130,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency costs for counterpart staff salaries, office accommodation and transportation, support \nservices, and seminars and workshops, as required. Detailed cost estimates and the financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Ministry of Finance and National Planning will be the Executing Agency. The chief \nexecutive officer will provide overall guidance in TA implementation, in close cooperation with \ncounterparts  from  the  Ministry  of  Commerce,  Business  Development  and  Investment,  the \nMinistry  of  Public  Enterprise  and  Public  Sector  Reform,  and  other  relevant  ministries  and \nagencies. The Executive Agency will proactively establish linkages between the TA and existing \ngovernment and public\u2013private task forces and committees relevant to private sector reform \nincluding,  but  not  necessarily  limited  to,  the  Cabinet  Subcommittee  for  Investment,  the \nDevelopment Subcommittee, the Prime Minister\u2019s Private Sector Think Tank, and the public\u2013\nprivate regulatory reform task force. \n  \n17.  The Executing Agency will secure good communications, cooperation, and coordination \nof inputs with relevant government ministries and agencies, thereby ensuring a consultative \nprocess  and  effectively  making  use  of  the  ADB  experts  in  the  field.  The  objective  is  to \nencourage policy dialogue and open discussion with high-level government decision makers, \npoliticians, and private sector participants. The Executing Agency is also expected to provide an \noverview  of  linkages  to  reform  implementation  plans  underway,  as  well  as  to  relevant \ngovernment policy, strategy, and decision-making processes.  \n \n18.  The TA will require 10 person-months of international and 3 person-months of domestic \nconsulting services. Expertise will be required in the areas of state-owned-enterprise reform and \npublic\u2013private partnerships, financial-sector development, and business law and property rights. \nConsultants will be selected and engaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. The outline terms of reference for consulting services are \nin Appendix 3.  \n \n19.  The TA will begin in February 2006 and will be implemented over 24 months until \nJanuary 2008, with intermittent inputs from the consultants. Consultants will be required to \nreport to the Executing Agency, the line ministry concerned, and ADB, in line with specific \nreporting requirements to be specified for each consultant assignment in the detailed terms of \nreference.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Fiji Islands for Private Sector Development Roadmaps, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n \n ", "  A\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  ix\n 1\n   6        \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions    \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \n      \u2022  Government ownership of the PSD \nIncreased private sector activity.
