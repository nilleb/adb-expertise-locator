THE PROPOSAL\n1. During a power sector mission to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam in May 1997,\nthe Government requested Bank technical assistance (TA) for improving the regulatory\nframework for the power sector. A Bank Fact-finding Mission for the TA visited Viet Nam in\nAugust 1997 and reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost\nestimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements for the TA. The TA is included in\nthe Bank's Country Assistance Program for 1997.1\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Until 1994, the power system in Viet Nam was regionally divided among three\npower companies (PCs): Power Company No. 1 (PCI), headquartered in Hanoi and operating\nin the north; Power Company No. 2 (PC2), based in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) and operating\nin the south; and Power Company No. 3 (P03), based in Da Nang and operating in the central\nregion. Each PC was vertically integrated and carried out all three functions of power generation,\ntransmission, and distribution. Effective 1 January 1995, a major reorganization of the power\nsector was carried out. Generation assets above 60 megawatts (MW) and all transmission\nfacilities of 11 0 kilovolts and above were transferred out of the PCs and centralized in a new\nState corporation, Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN). PCi and PC2 were split up to create two new\ndistribution companies for Hanoi (PC-Hanoi) and Ho Chi Minh City (PC-HCMC), respectively.\nThese institutional realignments resulted in unburtdling of the three vertically integrated\n(generation-transmission-distribution) companies into six functionally oriented enterprises, one\nfor generation and transmission and five for distribution.\n3. The power sector presently comprises EVN, engaged in countrywide generation\nand transmission (500 kV - 110 kV), and five regionally located PCs that purchase power from\nEVN and distribute (35 kV and below) in their respective franchise areas. Installed generation\ncapacity at the end of 1996 was 4,432 MW. Energy generated in 1996 amounted to\n16,906 gigawatt-hours (GWh). After allowing for auxiliary consumption and transmission and\ndistribution losses (about 20 percent), countrywide energy sales amounted to 13,286 GWh. PCi\naccounted for the largest portion of the electricity sales (31 .3 percent), followed by PC-HCMC\n(25.6 percent), P02 (22.3 percent), PC-Hanoi (11.5 percent), and PC3 (9.3 percent).\n4. The Ministry of Industry (MOl) is responsible for policy and oversight of the power\nsector. EVN is vested with all operating and management responsibilities for the sector except\nregulatory functions. However, in the absence of a regulatory framework to support the functional\nunbundling that has taken place, EVN, through its Management Board, advises MOl on\nregulatory aspects. EVN has the legal status of a State corporation under the State Enterprise\nLaw and comprises 12 generation units, 4 transmission companies, and a load despatch center.\nAdditionally, there are some entities engaged in noncore activities (such as finance, design,\nconstruction, and planning), which are also affiliated with EVN. 2 The five PCs are independent\nThe TA l9rst appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in June 1997.\nEVN and the PCs each have a number of subsidiaiy units. For example. EVNs corporate structure includes\nthe following: two power investigation and design companies responsible for planning, design, and\nsupervPsion of generation and transmission projects: four electrical power construction companies\nresponsible for implementing major power projects; the Institute of Energy responsible for formulating energy\npolicies, establishing power development plans both on a national scale and at the provincial and town\nlevels, and carrying out research in new techniques and materials to be used in the power industry; and,\nmanufacturing enterprises for electrical equipment, training schools, and hotels.", "accounting units and have the status of State enterprises. The PCs, like EVN, also carry out a\nnumber of noncore activities including operating hospitals and hotels.\n5. A comprehensive Power Policy was adopted by the Government in December\n1995 to give direction to the sector. Objectives of the Power Policy include providing increased\naccess to electricity, increasing operating and technical efficiency, improving quality of electricity\nsupply, resolving the mismatch between market-based production costs and State-administered\nprices, delineating State-management and business-management functions, and raising finances\nof the order of $1 billion per year to finance power sector expansion. The Power Policy outlines\na reform strategy for rationalizing power sector institutions and functions, commercializing\ninstitutions, developing a regulatory framework including an Electricity Law, adopting cost-based\ntariffs, promoting private sector participation, increasing rural access to electricity, and\nundertaking demand-side management.\n6. The Government recognizes that foreign investment will be required to achieve\nprojected investments in the power sector. A framework to attract build-operate-transfer (SOT)\ninvestments has been adopted. Notable features of this framework include guaranteeing\nconvertibility of local currency into foreign currency, permitting mortgaging of project assets,\nspecifying taxation levels, and allowing risk sharing by the Government and investors. Various\nshortcomings, however, continue to impede rapid development of BOT-type projects in the\npower sector, principally the lack of a comprehensive and transparent regulatory framework. The\nGovernment recognizes the importance of this and has taken the first steps to develop legislation\nfor the power sector by drafting an Electricity Law ri 1997 with the assistance of the World Bank.\n7. The draft Electricity Law aims to provide a broad framework for development and\nregulation of the sector. As now formulated, it is quite general. It identifies the institutions that\nwill be required, and outlines principles and concepts for allocation of tasks among agencies,\ndevelopment of a national energy policy, creating a framework for licensing and contracting, and\nregulating tariffs and investment programs. More specifically, the draft Law covers the following\ntopics: objectives of the Law; duties and responsibilities of Government institutions; suggested\nscope of a national energy policy; rights and duties of electric utilities; functions and structure\nof an Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA); factors to be considered in the supply and use of\npower such as safety, economy, service curtailmerits, metering, customer contributions, etc.;\nlicensing and approval of investments; principles and prooedures in tariff setting; and inspection,\naudit and penalties.\n8. The draft Electricity Law has been prepared under the supervision of a high-level\nSteering Committee constituted by the Government. The Committee comprises ten members\ndrawn from MOl, EVN, and other Government agencies and is headed by MCI. Day-to-day\nworking on the Electricity Law was carried out by a 12-member Working Group with the\nassistance of international consultants funded by the World Bank. The Working Group comprises\nfive representatives each from MCI and EVN, one from the Ministry of Justice, and one from the\nNational Assembly. The draft Law has been reviewed by various experts in Viet Nam and is now\nunder finalization by the Steering Committee for submission to the Government by the end of\n1997. The Government is expected to submit the draft Law to the National Assembly in 1998,\nwith formal adoption likely to follow in late 1998 or early 1999.", "3\n9. The Electricity Law is expected to serve as the basic foundation for the regulatory\nframework. At the same time, its usefulness is limited until it is operationalized by drawing up\nsupporting secondary legislation, regulations, and instructions, and setting up ERA as envisaged\nunder the Law. ERA is expected to play a vital role in the strategic development of the power\nsector (least-cost system expansion, investment planning and financing, fuel and electricity\npricing, retailing of electricity in rural areas, cross-subsidization, etc.) and in overseeing\nimplementation of the strategy with its regulatory powers. The Government therefore sought Bank\nTA in these areas to operationalize the proposed Electricity Law.\nlii THE TECHNICAL ASSiSTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n10. The objective of the TA is to assist the Government in (i) formulating secondary\nlegislation and regulations for operationalizing the proposed Electricity Law, (ii) setting up ERA,\nand (iii) sensitizing prospective ERA officials to the regulatory needs of the power sector.\nB.\t Scope\n11. The TA will include the following: (i) a presentation and workshop on various\nregulatory systems/laws applied to power sectors in countries around the world, to be followed\nby selection and adoption of practices best suited to Viet Nam; (ii) drafting of secondary\nlegislation, and implementing rules and regulations, to facilitate implementation of various\nprovisions in the Electricity Law relating in particular to tariff regulation (recommend policies,\nprinciples, procedures and methodology for tariff setting; and provide guidelines on tariff\nstructure and cross subsidies betwen consumer categories) and review/approval of investment\nprograms; (iii) keeping in view the goal of the sector to develop a competitive power market,\nrecommendations on the role, responsibilities, location, organization structure, staffing pattern,\netc. for ERA; and criteria, procedures, and a forum for appealing and reviewing ERA's decisions;\nand (iv) sensitization of prospective ERA officials (a maximum of six persons, to be approved by\nthe Bank) to good regulatory practices in the Asian and Pacific Region through study tours to\nthree or four countries, including those where power markets actually function and large\nconsumers can exercise choice over supplier. Outline terms of reference for the TA are given in\nAppendix 1.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n12. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $870,000 equivalent, including $700,000\nin foreign exchange and $1 70,000 equivalent in local currency (see Appendix 2). The Bank will\nfinance the entire foreign exchange cost and $100,000 equivalent in local currency for a total of\n$800,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed by the Bank on a grant basis from the Bank-funded\nTA Program.1 The Government's contribution of $70,000 equivalent ri kind will represent the\ncost of local support provided by MOl to the consultants such as counterpart staff, office\naccommodation, interpreters, facilities for local communications, and data collection.\nThe TA is proposed initially as a grant from the Bank-funded TA Program (i.e., TASF). The TA is currently\nunder consideration for possible funding from the Japan Special Fund (JSF). If such funding is approved\nby the Government of Japan, the Bank will shift the source of funding from Bank-funded TA Program to JSF.", "4\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n13. MOl will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The TA will require about 18 person-\nmonths of international consultants from an international consulting firm with hands-on\nexperience in the legal, regulatory, and institutional aspects of the power sector, and 10 person-\nmonths of domestic consultants for local support. One of the tnternational consultants will act\nas team leader. MOI will create a counterpart Steering Committee and a Working Group for the\nProject, with composition and function similar to those described in para. 8. The international\nconsulting firm and the associated domestic consulting firm will be selected based on simplified\ntechnical proposals in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and\nother arrangements satisfactory to the Bank on the engagement of domestic consultants. The\ninternational consultants will be responsible to the Bank for the total scope of work. in carrying\nout their work, the consultants will take into account the Power Policy adopted by the\nGovernment and also coordinate with the World Bank Resident Office in Hanoi from time to time\n'to ensure that their work complements the proposed Electricity Law prepared under World Bank\nassistance. The consulting services are expected to commence in April 1998 and be completed\nby December 1998.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECiSiON\n14.
