During  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  Country  Programming  Mission  to \nUzbekistan in 2001, the Government requested ADB technical assistance (TA) for energy needs \nassessment.  The  ADB  TA  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  Uzbekistan  in  July  2002,  and  an \nunderstanding was reached with the Government on the scope, approach, and implementation \nand financing arrangements of the TA. 1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Uzbekistan is self-sufficient with regard to its commercial energy supplies. Natural gas is \nits  most  important  source  of  primary  energy  consumption  (83%),  followed  by  oil  and \ncondensates  (14%), coal  (2%),  and  hydropower  (1%).  It  is  estimated  that  Uzbekistan  has \nproven oil reserves of about 594 million barrels and natural gas reserves of 66.2 trillion cubic \nfeet (TCF). Present oil and condensates production of about 160,000 barrels per day exceeds \ndomestic demand of about 130,000 barrrels per day. Present annual natural gas production is \nabout 2 TCF, of which about 0.5 TCF is exported, while coal production is about 2.9 million tons; \nhowever, domestic coal consumption has declined from about 5.8 million tons in 1992 to less \nthan 2.9 million tons at present. Uzbekistan has 37 power plants with a total installed capacity of \n11.7 gigawatts.  \n \n3.  Since 1997, Uzbekistan\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) has increased annually by 4.0-\n5.2%. At the same time, annual primary commercial energy consumption increased to about 60 \nmillion  tons  of  oil  equivalent  (Mtoe),  which  is  about  1.5\u20132.0  times  higher  than  in  other \ndeveloping countries on a GDP basis. Assuming further annual GDP growth rates of 5-6% \nduring 2002-2005 and 7-8% during 2006-2010 and a continuation of the present inefficiency of \nenergy use, an annual primary energy consumption of about 73 Mtoe is predicted by 2010. \nHowever,  current  levels  of  energy  consumption  could  be  reduced  by  up  to  40%  through \nimprovement of the efficiency of energy consumption without compromising projected economic \ngrowth and the basic energy requirements of the population. In this context, the Government \nalso  signed  the  European  Energy  Charter  Treaty  and  Energy  Charter  Protocol  on  energy \nefficiency and related environmental aspects.2  This protocol requires each party to prepare a \nstrategy for energy conservation. Therefore, in accordance with the Law on Rational Use of \nEnergy, Uzbekistan\u2019s Cabinet of Ministers adopted an energy-saving program on 14 February \n2002. The main objectives of the program are to (i) prioritize energy conservation issues and \ndevelop  appropriate  policies  to  address  them,  (ii)  improve  the  efficiency  of  using  energy \nresources  and  promote  energy  conservation,  (iii)  reduce  energy  intensities  in  the  industry \nsector, (iv) prepare legislation that would promote energy efficiency and investments in energy \nconservation, and (v) promote the development of a market-oriented energy sector. \n \n4.  The energy saving program is to be implemented in two stages, with the first stage \ncovering 2002-2005 and the second stage covering 2006-2010. During the first stage, activities \nwill  focus  on  identifying  appropriate  measures  for  promoting  investments  in  energy \nconservation,  energy  tariff  reform,  and  development  of  economic  incentives  for  energy \nconservation. It also involves identification and implementation of energy conservation activities \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 2 September 2002.               \n2 The main objective of the Treaty, which was signed on 17 December 1994, is to establish a legal \nframework to promote long-term cooperation in the energy field in accordance with the principles of the \nEuropean Energy Charter. The Treaty\u2019s most important provisions concern investment protection, trade \nin energy materials and products, transit, and dispute settlement.    ", "2  \nthat  are  urgently  required  and  would  produce  relatively  high  benefits  and  preparation  of \nlegislation and measures to promote energy conservation. During the second phase the energy \nconservation  legislation  and  measures  would  become  effective,  and  energy  conservation \nprojects with payback periods of up to 7 years would be implemented with the overall objective \nof limiting primary commercial energy consumption to 58 Mtoe in 2010, which would be 2 Mtoe \nless than the present annual primary commercial energy consumption and 15 Mtoe less than \nthe projected annual primary commercial energy consumption by 2010 without improvement of \nthe present inefficiency of energy use. \n \n5.  The  Government  has  assigned  high  priority  to  energy  efficiency  improvement  with \nregard  to  (i)  electric  power  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution;  (ii)  natural  gas \ntransmission  and  distribution  systems;  (iii)  oil  production  and  refining;  (iv)  coal  production, \nbeneficiation, and transportation; (v) supply of steam and hot water through district heating \nsystems; (vi) production processes in the chemical, metallurgical, and engineering industries; \n(vii)  buildings  and  building  materials;  (viii)  electricity  generation  and  consumption  in  the \nagriculture sector; and (ix) fuel use in the transportation sector. The Government estimates that \ninvestments of more than $2 billion will be required to meet its energy conservation target by \n2010. With regard to the various sectors, the Government has identified about 50 energy \ngeneration facilities that need to be modernized and upgraded with assistance from multilateral \nand  bilateral  sources  and  private  sector  investors.  Work  has  begun  with  regard  to  the \nmodernization and upgrading of some steam and hot water generation facilities with assistance \nfrom the European Union. Some power plants are being rehabilitated with assistance from the \nEuropean  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD)  and  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational Cooperation; however, other power plants with a combined capacity of 1,800 \nmegawatts still require financing for their rehabilitation. EBRD is also providing assistance for \nthe upgrading of the Fergana oil refinery and rehabilitation of the district heating system in the \ncity of Andijan.  \n \n6.  Uzbekenergo is the state-owned joint stock company responsible for the generation, \ntransmission, and distribution of electricity in Uzbekistan. Uzbekenergo consists of a network of \nsubsidiary  power  companies  including  all  power  stations,  distribution  and  transmission \nnetworks, and other related energy companies. The Government\u2019s reform program envisages \nthat all power distribution entities will be made shareholding companies by 2003; followed by \npower  generation  entities  by  2005.  Steam  and  hot  water  generation  is  undertaken  by \nUzbekenergo (25%), large boiler plants of local authorities (30%), and small boiler plants of \nmunicipal authorities (45%).  Within urban areas the concerned communal services agency is \nresponsible for the distribution of steam and hot water. The state-owned joint stock company, \nUzbekneftegaz, is responsible for all aspects of oil and natural gas exploration and production, \noil refining, gas processing, and oil and gas transportation. One of Uzbekneftegaz\u2019 joint stock \ncompanies,  Uztransgaz,  is  responsible  for  transportation  of  natural  gas  through  main  gas \npipelines, while natural gas distribution is undertaken by the concerned communal services \nagency. \n \n7.  The  Government  realizes  that  more  assistance  is  required  for  meeting  its  energy \nconservation  target.  In  particular,  in  addition  to  rehabilitation  of  power  plants  there  is \nconsiderable potential for further efficiency improvement in the district heating systems, which \nsupply hot water and steam to urban consumers, and in the distribution of power and natural \ngas. The district heating systems have been in operation for more than 30 years; use an open \nsystem  of  hot  water  and  steam  supply,  which  does  not  permit  proper  regulation  of  the \ntemperature by suppliers and consumers and supplies more heat to consumers closest to the \nplants than necessary; have inadequate water treatment devices, which has led to internal ", "  3\ncorrosion of the boilers and pipes; and use obsolete boilers, which cannot be properly regulated. \nThe  efficiency  of  power  transmission  and  distribution  suffers  from  technical  deficiencies, \nincluding system losses of 12% due to overload of the transmission and distribution lines, \nsystem imbalances, and obsolete substations and transmission and distribution lines. In 2000, \nUzbekistan  generated  about  44.1  terawatt-hours  of  electricity  and  consumed  about  41.9 \nterawatt-hours. However, due to the deteriorated power infrastructure, a considerable portion of \nthe power generated in Uzbekistan did not reach consumers, and Uzbekistan became a net \nelectricity importer. The efficiency of natural gas distribution is also affected by the relatively \nobsolete domestic gas transmission and distribution pipeline system and by the absence of \nsufficient meters for measuring gas consumption by end-users.  \n \n8.  At the same time, the inefficiencies are compounded by the absence of an appropriate \ninstitutional and regulatory framework for the production and distribution of commercial energy \nand a delay in the reform of energy tariffs to reflect the cost of their supply and provide \nincentives for consumers to conserve energy. Further, the feasibility of establishing energy \nservice companies, which would act as an intermediary to assist commercial and residential \nconsumers to achieve energy savings and would be paid from the energy savings realized, \nwould need to assessed. Also, Uzbekistan would seem have considerable potential for using \nnew energy technologies such as solar water heating systems and compressed natural gas \n(CNG), which would contribute to improving energy efficiency with regard to the supply of hot \nwater for residential, commercial, and industrial users and fuel in the transportation sector. The \nGovernment, therefore, has requested ADB assistance to review the above aspects of its \nenergy program and identify potential energy-saving projects that could be considered for ADB \nsupport. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The  TA  will  support  basic  reforms  in  the  energy  sector  in  line  with ADB\u2019s  country \nstrategy for Uzbekistan. The TA will review the Government\u2019s energy-saving program in the \npower, natural gas, and district heating sectors with the aim of producing a comprehensive plan \nthat will guide and promote the Government\u2019s energy-saving policy in these areas to 2010, \nidentify priority projects that would help meet the Government\u2019s target for energy efficiency \nimprovement, and carry out selected prefeasibility studies for a number of such projects.3 \nOutputs under the TA will include (i) strengthened government energy saving program in the \npower, natural gas, and district heating sectors and a more effective Department of Energy \n(DOE) under the Cabinet of Ministers, which is responsible for its implementation; (ii) options for \nstrengthening the institutional and regulatory framework for the supply and consumption of \ncommercial  energy  and  reform  of  concerned  energy  tariffs  to  increase  the  availability  of \naffordable commercial energy for the poor; (iii) identification of the most effective energy-saving \nactivities and projects that need to be undertaken in the power, gas, and district heating sectors \nto meet the Government\u2019s target for increased energy efficiency; (iv) options for mobilizing the \nrequired investments for development of such activities and projects including the establishment \nof energy services companies; (v) assessment of the potential of using solar water heating \nsystems to provide hot water to residential, commercial, and industrial consumers; and (vi) \nassessment of the potential for increased small-scale use of natural gas for distributed power \ngeneration and use in vehicles as CNG.  \n                                                 \n3  The preparation of prefeasibility studies for power projects would be considered only if such projects conform with \nthe development of a wholesale regional power market in Central Asia as supported by ADB.  ", "4  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will be implemented in close consultation with all stakeholders and interested \nparties, including the public and private sectors and the aid community. For this purpose three \nworkshops  will  be  held  \u2013\u2013  at  the  beginning,  the  midterm  stage,  and  the  end  of  TA \nimplementation  \u2013\u2013  to  explain  the  targets  and  achievements  of  the  TA  and  discuss  the \nconsultants\u2019 findings and recommendations, including the prefeasibility studies prepared by \nthem. During the TA Inception Mission, the Government, the consultants, and ADB will agree on \nthe geographical areas for which the preparation of prefeasibility studies will be considered so \nas to maximize the TA\u2019s impact and its benefits for the poor. At the midterm stage of TA \nimplementation, the Government, the consultants, and ADB will decide which projects appear to \nbe sufficiently technically feasible and offer good potential for achieving energy savings to justify \nthe preparation of corresponding pre-feasibility studies under the TA. It is envisaged that, based \non the outcome of the prefeasibility studies, the provision of further ADB TA will be considered \nto prepare feasibility studies for up to three projects, which in comparison with the other projects \nwould be the most relevant for the Government\u2019s energy conservation efforts. The consultants\u2019 \nfindings and recommendations with regard to strengthening the institutional and regulatory \nframework for the supply and consumption of commercial energy and reform of concerned \nenergy tariffs will also provide an input for further policy dialogue and the preparation of such \nprojects. During TA implementation, staff from DOE and other concerned organizations will \nreceive in-country training in the measurement of energy efficiency and energy wastage; basic \nfeatures of energy conservation technologies; and implementation, monitoring, and updating of \nthe Government\u2019s energy saving program\u2013\u2013 with the assistance of a computer model to be \ndeveloped by the consultants. Three staff will familiarize themselves with the operations of a \nsimilar energy conservation unit abroad. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The  entire  ADB  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $860,000  equivalent  comprising  a  foreign \nexchange component of about $522,000 and a local currency component of about $338,000 \nequivalent, as indicated in Appendix 1. ADB will finance the entire foreign exchange costs and \n$78,000 equivalent of the local currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The balance of the local currency costs comprising the costs \nassociated with counterpart staff; office and communication facilities required for the consulting \nservices; secretarial support; seminars; and provision of relevant studies, surveys, and reports \nwill be covered by the Government as an in-kind contribution. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  DOE will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will assign four staff to work with the \nconsultants. A working group, comprising representatives from the Ministry of Economics and \nStatistics, Uzbekenergo, Uzbekneftegaz, Uztransgaz; concerned owners of boiler plants for \ndistrict heating; and communal services agencies, will be established, which will be chaired by a \nrepresentative from DOE. The working group will regularly meet with the consultants to discuss \nthe progress of TA implementation. The Government will make all relevant studies, reports, and \nsurveys available to the consultants.  \n \n13.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  by  an  internationally  recognized  consulting  firm  in \nassociation with domestic consultants over a period of 6 months. The TA is expected to begin \nby April 2003 and to be completed by October 2003. The team of consultants will comprise ", "  5\nseven international experts with experience in (i) steam-based thermal power production; (ii) \npower transmission and distribution; (iii) steam and hot water production and district heating \nsystems; (iv) natural gas distribution and use for CNG and distributed power generation; (v) \nintroduction, local manufacture, and use of solar water heating systems; (vi) institutional and \nregulatory  frameworks  for  commercial  energy  production  and  distribution;  and  (vii)  energy \neconomics and tariffs. One of the first three experts listed will act as team leader. The experts \nunder  (i)  -  (iv)  will  be  required  to  have  experience  in  the  development  of  energy  saving \nprograms in their respective areas of expertise. They will be assisted by four domestic experts \nwith experience in, respectively (i) power sector operations, (ii) gas sector operations, (iii) district \nheating systems operations, and (iv) energy planning and analysis. It is estimated that the input \nof the international consultants will be about 14 person-months (including 12 person-months in \nthe field and about 2 person-month in their home office). The input of the domestic consultants \nwill  be  3  person-months  each.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  in \nAppendix 2, while the logical framework for the TA is in Appendix 3. \n \n14.  Formal tripartite review meetings to discuss the consultants\u2019 midterm and final reports \nwill be held within 3 and 5 months, respectively, after commencement of the consulting services; \nthe latter will coincide with the third workshop at the end of TA implementation. The consultants \nwill also provide in-country training and arrange an overseas study tour for concerned DOE \nstaff. The consultants will procure and rent the equipment that is required for TA implementation \nfollowing consultation with the Government and ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. The international and domestic consultants for the TA will be recruited by ADB on \nthe basis of submission of simplified technical proposals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants using the quality and cost-based selection procedure. ADB will \nfinance the attendance of a Government observer at the contract negotiations, which will be \nheld at ADB headquarters in Manila.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Uzbekistan for Energy Needs Assessment, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board.   \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nCOST ESTIMATES \n($) \n \nItem  Foreign   Local   Total \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nA.
