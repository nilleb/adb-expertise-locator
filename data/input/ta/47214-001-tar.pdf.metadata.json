INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Social Protection Operational Plan, 2014\u20132020 of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  identifies  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  as  a  potential  sector  for \ninvestments  and  knowledge  work  to  strengthen  social  protection  programs  in  developing \nmember countries (DMCs).1 Initiatives like ICT for Development (ICTD) have shown that ICT \ncan  improve  living  conditions  in societies.2 While  many  DMCs  have  expanded  their  social \nprotection  programs  and  developed  national  social  protection strategies,  ICT  use  in  social \nprotection delivery across the Asia and Pacific region has been limited.3 In contrast, innovations \nin ICT have been more widely used to improve governance and public service delivery in \nsectors such as education and health.4 \n \n2.  ICT for social protection can enhance targeting through more effective identification of \nbeneficiaries and improve payment mechanisms, which will result in lower transaction costs \nwhen accessing payments or benefits.5 ICT has also played a vital role in identity management, \nwhich has been linked to stronger governance of public social services. Evidence of efficiency \ngains from ICT use in social protection programs is extensively available for Latin America and \nthe Caribbean. However, for Asia and the Pacific, evidence is currently limited and not well \ndisseminated. DMC capacity to maximize benefits from investments in ICT to improve social \nprotection delivery remains weak. Knowledge and capacity gaps in DMCs perpetuate the digital \ndivide  between  developing  and  developed  economies.  Against  this  context,  the  technical \nassistance (TA) intends to take stock global and regional best practices on ICT use in the \ndesign  and  delivery  of  social  protection  programs  through  a  regional  study,  and  build \ninstitutional and administrative capacity for applying or replicating some of the ICT tools to \nimprove  the  efficiency  of  social  protection  programs  in  selected  DMCs.6 The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The high priority accorded to the role of social protection in eradicating poverty in the \npost-2015 development agenda paves the way for DMCs to expand and strengthen social \nprotection programs.7 However, existing social protection programs suffer from lack of strategic \ndevelopment priorities and remain fragmented due to weak institutional capacity and fiscal \nconstraints. Problems in beneficiary identification and targeting, payment systems, monitoring, \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

This leads to program leakages, and higher transaction and administration costs \nfor the government. DMC representatives in several ADB capacity-building workshops on social \nprotection have pointed out that improvements in ICT use can improve beneficiary identification, \nrecords management, and benefit and payment administration, particularly in poor communities \nthat are geographically harder to reach by traditional means of service delivery. \n \n4.  Delivery mechanisms or systems are critical elements of social protection programs. \nThese absorb high proportions of administrative and operating costs and can undermine a \nprogram\u2019s cost effectiveness and efficiency. Despite their importance, delivery systems often \nreceive inadequate attention in the design of social protection programs. Ensuring reliable \ndelivery of social protection programs such as cash transfers to the elderly, women, vulnerable \ngroups, and the poor can be challenging, especially in some DMCs with weak administrative \ncapacities and lack of infrastructure. The ideal delivery mechanism should be (i) affordable and \ncost-effective; (ii) accountable and transparent; (iii) reliable and accessible at low cost (of money \nand time); and (iv) secured against fraud, corruption, and theft. Innovations in ICT, when applied \nto social protection programs, can help achieve these objectives. \n \n5.  Using  ICT  to  improve  delivery  mechanisms  of  social  protection  programs  presents \nopportunities to increase cost effectiveness and efficiency, offers greater flexibility to recipients, \nand provides ancillary benefits such as access to financial services, thus improving financial \ninclusiveness. The use of smart cards in cash transfer programs in Pakistan and the Philippines \nhas contributed to women\u2019s empowerment by giving women greater control over cash. In similar \nprograms, women beneficiaries have used their smart cards to gain better access to formal \nbanking services, which reflects positively on their social status.8 \n \n6.  Given the growing popularity of cash transfers as a social protection instrument, national \nprograms have adopted a variety of ICTD initiatives besides the use of smart cards. These \ninclude  use  of  cellular  or  mobile  phones,  mobile  ATMs,  GPS  devices,  and  biometrics  for \nbeneficiary  identification  and  payment  delivery.  This  proves  that  the  availability  of  ICT \ninfrastructure can provide tools to improve the effectiveness of social protection programs. ICT, \nif applied properly, can also help expand the reach of social protection programs at lower costs. \nDigitalization of cash transfer programs has occurred in Azerbaijan, Indonesia, Pakistan, the \nPhilippines, and countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, such as Brazil, Mexico, and Peru. \nThe use of mobile phones has reduced transaction costs and increased the speed of service \ndelivery.  E-banking  has  also  helped  remove  some  constraints  in  payment  delivery  under \nconditional cash transfers. \n \n7.  However, while development of ICT has been very fast, efforts to use it in delivering \nsocial protection programs have not been very pronounced. ADB\u2019s DMCs can learn from the \nexperience of India,9 the Republic of Korea,10 and Singapore11 to fuel institutional development \n                                                \n8 S.

", "3 \ntoward successful ICTD initiatives for social protection programs. ADB has supported several \nprojects linking ICT use with social protection delivery.12 ADB has also supported civil registry \nand vital statistics systems together with the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the \nPacific to enhance public service delivery. These systems that support identity management \nplay a pivotal role in better determining vulnerable groups because the data they provide can be \nlinked to variables that affect well-being, such as education, health, location, and jobs. \n \n8.  By facilitating knowledge sharing on ICT use in social protection across countries and \nsubregions, ADB can help bridge technological gaps and promote inclusiveness through better \ndesign and implementation of social protection programs. In connection with this, the TA aims to \ncollect evidence and share knowledge on best ICT practices in DMCs in the delivery of social \nassistance programs. It will also take stock of innovations in identity management\u2014i.e., latest \nICT  tools  to  strengthen  public  service  delivery\u2014which  in  turn  could  aid  improvements  in \ntargeting and delivery mechanisms of social protection programs. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be improved delivery of social protection programs through expanded \napplication of ICT in DMCs in Asia and the Pacific. The outcome will be increased ICT literacy \nand stronger capacity of policy makers and government officials to design and implement social \nprotection  programs  in  DMCs.  The  TA  endeavors  to  build  administrative  capacity  for  the \nadoption  of ICT tools  to  enhance  beneficiary targeting  and  delivery  mechanisms  of  social \nprotection programs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  TA  promotes  innovations  that  foster  inclusiveness  in  social  protection  through \napplication of ICT, along with capacity building for national agencies in implementation and \nmonitoring of social protection programs. It will support two main outputs: (i) regional study on \nbest ICT use in social protection programs, and (ii) capacity developed in DMCs for ICT use in \nsocial protection. Both outputs are designed to highlight best practices and share these with \npolicy  makers  and  government  officials  to  bridge  knowledge  and  capacity  gaps.  Activities \nsupported under each output are detailed in paras. 11\u201312. \n \n11.  Output 1: Regional study on information and communication technology use in \nsocial protection programs.

This will showcase \ntechnological solutions that can be applied to improve targeting, payments, monitoring, and \nassessment of social protection program. The regional study will also collect information on \nwhat type and size of investment in ICT is needed to improve public service delivery. In addition, \nit  will  present  at  least  three  country  case  reports,  to  be  determined  in  consultation  with \noperations  departments  and  based  on  demand  from  DMCs.  Mongolia,  Pakistan,  and  the \nPhilippines  are  initially  being  considered  for  the  country  cases  because  of  their  recent \nexperience in utilizing technological innovations in social assistance programs.13 Synergies and \nlinks with other ADB projects, including TA with ICT components on improving public service \ndelivery, will also be established during implementation. \n \n12.  Output 2: Capacity developed in developing member countries for information and \ncommunication technology use in social protection. The TA will strengthen DMC capacity \nfor use of ICT in specific national social protection programs. This output will bring in experts on \nthe matter at forums with DMCs.14 Output activities will include:  \n(i)  Regional  capacity-building  workshop  on  ICT  use  in  social  protection \nprograms. The TA will convene ICT experts from Asia and the Pacific and also \ninvite experts outside the region to share best practices, recent technological \ninnovations, and prospective application of ICT to improve design and delivery of \nsocial protection programs. The workshop will support South\u2013South learning and \nknowledge sharing as part of the Asia\u2013Pacific Social Protection Network. \n(ii)  Regional capacity-building conference on identity management. Supportive \nof knowledge sharing and regional cooperation in ICT for social protection, the \nTA  will  also  support  the  international  conference  on  identity management  in \nSeoul  (proposed  to  be  held  in  September  2014)  in  collaboration  with  three \nregional  development  banks\u2014African  Development  Bank,  ADB,  and  Inter-\nAmerican  Development  Bank.  The  conference  supports  South\u2013South \ncooperation in expanding the knowledge base on identity management and will \ndiscuss  best  practices  and  potential  collaboration  to  establish  national  civil \nidentification  and  its  application  to  public  sector  management  and  social \nprotection.  \n(iii)  Country-specific  capacity  building  and  knowledge  exchange  on \ninformation  and  communication  technology.  Country-specific  capacity-\nbuilding workshops on some ICT applications for social protection programs will \nbe supported in at least three DMCs. These workshops will also be used as \nvenues to engage with stakeholders in selected DMCs to promote ICT use for \nbetter design and delivery of social protection programs. The workshops will \ndisseminate  related  best  practices  and  innovations  to  raise  awareness  and \nimprove technical capacity.

The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nRepublic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB. The cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The TA duration is 2 years, from July 2014 to June 2016. ADB will be the executing \nagency.  ADB\u2019s  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  will  have  the  overall \nadministrative, advisory, and coordinating role for the TA, and will work closely with regional \ndepartments and the Office of Information Systems and Technology during implementation of \ncountry-specific activities. ADB staff will be tapped to serve as resource persons in capacity-\nbuilding workshops, and provide administrative or secretariat support for the implementation of \nregional training activities. Relevant ministries or departments in Mongolia, Pakistan, and the \nPhilippines will be tapped as knowledge partners for the capacity-building output of this TA.15 \nADB will work with the International Telecommunication Union Regional Office for Asia and the \nPacific as the partner center of excellence for this TA. \n \n15.  Consultants will be engaged individually in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The TA requires 7 person-months of \ninternational consulting services and 25 person-months of national consulting services. The \nteam will consist of (i) three international consultants with expertise in design and delivery of \nsocial protection programs combined with ICT expertise; and (ii) an estimated six national \nconsultants, three of whom will support design and delivery of country-specific capacity-building \nprograms for at least three selected DMCs. As the TA requires a distinctive combination of \nnational experts with expertise in social protection and ICT, it is deemed necessary to infuse \nflexibility in recruitment during TA implementation. Depending on the availability of experts for \nthe implementation of capacity-building activities, individual consultants or a firm will be used to \navoid delays in TA implementation. ADB\u2019s Operations Services and Financial Management \nDepartment will be consulted during consultant recruitment. The outline terms of reference for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. The proposed budget will also support knowledge creation and \nsharing for other DMCs, and publication and dissemination activities. Disbursements under the \nTA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n16.
