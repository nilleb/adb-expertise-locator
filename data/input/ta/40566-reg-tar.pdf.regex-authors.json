After the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN) realized it needed to heighten regional cooperation and integration (RCI) among its \nmembers. Foremost among RCI initiatives since then are the ASEAN Surveillance Process \n(ASP), ASEAN+3 Economic Review and Policy Dialogue (ERPD), the Chiang Mai Initiative \n(CMI), and the ASEAN+3 Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI). Subsequently, with the setback \nof the multilateral trading system and, most recently, the suspension of Doha Development \nRound of the World Trade Organization (WTO), ASEAN members have worked even more \nclosely together to take advantage of opportunities in regional cooperation.   \n2.  At the Ninth ASEAN Summit held in Bali, Indonesia, in October 2003, ASEAN leaders \ndeclared  that  an  ASEAN  Economic  Community  (AEC)  would  be  the  end  goal  of  ASEAN \neconomic integration by 2020; the time was later accelerated to 2015 at the ASEAN Summit in \nJanuary  2007  in  Cebu,  Philippines.  The  AEC  aims  to  transform  ASEAN  into  a  stable, \nprosperous, and highly competitive region with equitable economic development, and reduced \npoverty and socioeconomic disparities. To support this process, the ASEAN Secretariat (ASEC) \nis  expected  to  (i)  provide  in-depth  policy  inputs  for  ASEAN  policy  dialogues on  economic \nintegration in regional forums such as the ASEAN Economic Ministers (AEM) and the ASEAN \nFinance Ministers (AFM) processes; and (ii) monitor and enforce AEC implementation. \n3.  Due to the increased burden arising from the quickened pace of regional cooperation \nand deepening efforts in regional integration, ASEC\u2014whose resources are overstretched\u2014\nneeds  to  increase  its  capacity  to  adequately  perform  its  duties.  ASEC  has  signed  a \nmemorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),1 which \nprovides for an overall framework of cooperation in support of RCI, and calls, in part, for ADB to \nenhance ASEC\u2019s institutional capacity. This includes strengthening the Bureau of Economic \nIntegration and Finance (BEIF). This technical assistance (TA) is designed to strengthen the \ncapacity of ASEC\u2014particularly BEIF\u2014to support the ASEAN economic integration process, \nincluding implementation of the AEC. The design and monitoring framework is attached as \nAppendix 1.2  \nII.   ISSUES \n \n4.  The AEC represents the economic integration espoused in ASEAN Vision 2020, which \naims to deepen and broaden economic integration through existing and new initiatives with clear \ntimelines. The AEC is expected to establish ASEAN as a single market and production base, \nthereby enhancing ASEAN\u2019s economic competitiveness. New mechanisms and measures will \nbe adopted to strengthen implementation of existing economic initiatives; to further accelerate \nASEAN economic integration; to facilitate cross-border movement of business persons, skilled \nlabor, and talent; and to strengthen the institutional mechanisms of ASEAN.  \n \n5.  ASEC is mandated to \u201cinitiate, advise, coordinate and implement ASEAN activities.\u201d3 \nWhile ASEC is relatively effective to date, its administrative workload has increased with the \nrecent rapid proliferation of ASEAN meetings and forums. With ASEAN as de facto hub for \nASEAN+3 and East Asian cooperation generally, ASEC has taken on secretariat support for \n                                                 \n1  The MOU was initiated in November 2005. It was signed in August 2006 after consultations with relevant ASEAN \nbodies.  \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 13 July 2006. \n3  Fourth ASEAN Summit, Singapore, 1992. \n ", "2   \nthese  processes  as  well.  This  increased  administrative  burden  has  further  limited  ASEC\u2019s \ncapacity to fulfill its policy advisory role.4 \n6.  Several international aid agencies have funded research programs to enable ASEC to \naddress long-term policy issues on ASEAN economic integration: the United States Agency for \nInternational  Development  (USAID),  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development \n(AusAID), and the European Union (EU). Among others, their programs have supported the \npreparation  of  quality  research  papers  on  issues  related  to  ASEAN  economic  integration. \nHowever,  due  to  a  deepening  process  of  ASEAN  economic  integration,  ASEC  is  under \nincreasing pressure to prepare timely policy notes and briefs at the request of relevant ASEAN \nbodies.  Thus,  to  make  support  more  demand-driven  to  ASEAN  and  more  responsive  to \nemerging issues, the TA\u2019s approach is to integrate and mainstream such support within ASEC\u2019s \nbusiness process (see methodology and key activities).   \n7.  Since the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis, ADB has supported ASEC through a number of \nTA  programs  for  the  ASP  and  ASEAN+3  ERPD. 5  Those  programs  have  significantly \nstrengthened the capacity of ASEC and ASEAN member countries in regional economic and \nfinancial monitoring. As ASEAN economic cooperation in trade and investment has quickly \ngathered speed, it is also helpful to expand ADB\u2019s support to these areas to further strengthen \nASEC\u2019s policy advisory role for ASEAN economic integration.  \n8.  The demand for timely and quality policy briefs by ASEC is growing rapidly. Recently, \nAEM and AFM requested several policy briefs on emerging issues, such as a study of the \nimpact  of  high  energy  prices  and  a  study  of  the  impact  of  the  proliferation  of  free  trade \nagreements (FTA). A deepening process of ASEAN economic integration will likely generate \nincreased demands for quick policy responses. In the long term, ASEC needs to augment its \n\u201csecretariat\u201d function with a more research-oriented one. In the short term, ASEC requires \nincreased capacity to respond to emerging policy issues of ASEAN economic integration. \n9.  ASEC is striving to enhance its capacity by realigning its organizational structure, e.g., \nmerging the Bureau for Economic Integration (which dealt with trade and investment) and the \nBureau for Finance and Integration Support (which dealt with macroeconomic surveillance and \nfinancial  integration)  into  the  new  BEIF.  Due  to  budgetary  constraints,  this  organizational \nrealignment was a redeployment of staff rather than an increase in staff level. In the immediate \nand medium-term future, there is no plan to substantially increase the level of staff of ASEC, \nparticularly BEIF, despite the growing number of ASEAN meetings. In the long term, the ASEAN \nCharter, which is being prepared by ASEAN member countries, is expected, among others, to \nidentify innovative measures to increase the contributions of ASEAN member countries. This \nmove may substantially provide greater opportunities for ASEC to augment its financial and \nhuman resources to sustain its functions. Thus, capacity support for ASEC in the short and \nmedium term is needed. The TA will help provide additional capacity for ASEC in the form of \nconsulting services.   \n10.  ASEC  has  actually  requested  ADB  to  provide  research  and  support  for  capacity \ndevelopment since March 2006.6 A MOU between ASEC and ADB, which was initiated in 2005 \n                                                 \n4  Currently, ASEC has a total of about 60 professional staff (openly recruited staff). Of that number, 25 professional \nstaff are with BEIF. ASEC has to support around 500\u2013600 ASEAN meetings annually. The bulk of ASEAN \nmeetings is on economic issues, which are under the purview of BEIF.  \n5  Regional TAs 5695, 6012, 5870, 5879, 6210, 6019, 5827, 6071, 6019, and 5827. \n6  The request was made at high-level consultations between ADB and the ASEAN Senior Economic Officials \nMeeting (SEOM) in March 2006 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. \n ", "  3\nand signed in August 2006, provides an overall framework of cooperation between the two in \nsupport of the ASEAN economic cooperation and integration process. ADB\u2019s RCI strategy, \nadopted  in  July  2006,  outlines  ADB\u2019s  broad  strategic  direction  in  supporting  economic \ncooperation and integration. The TA is consistent with RCI Pillar 2 (trade and investment \ncooperation and integration) and Pillar 3 (monetary and financial cooperation and integration). It \nwill  help  ASEC  strengthen  its  capacity  to  support  ASEAN  economic  integration.  This  is \nparticularly important as ASEAN strives to transform itself from a meetings-based association to \na more rules-based institution\u2014as outlined by ASEAN leaders at the 2007 Twelfth ASEAN \nSummit, Cebu, Philippines.   \nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n11.  The TA aims to help improve the quality and effectiveness of ASEAN policy dialogue \nprocesses in the fora such as the AEM and AFM by strengthening the capacity of ASEC to \nrespond to emerging issues of ASEAN economic integration, including implementation of the \nAEC. \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The intended impact is improved quality and effectiveness of ASEAN policy dialogues \nfor ASEAN economic integration. The expected outcome is an enhanced ASEC institutional \ncapacity to (i) provide timely and quality policy briefs on selected topics that arise in the process \nof ASEAN economic integration, and (ii) monitor AEC implementation. \n \n13.  Expected results and deliverables include producing \n \n(i)  timely and effective research and policy briefings for AEM and AFM on issues \nrelated to ASEAN economic integration and policy dialogue (e.g., monetary and \nexchange  rate  policy,  development  of  regional  macroprudential  indicators, \nfinancial capital markets, trade and investment, among others); \n \n(ii)  capacity development programs for ASEC staff, including brief in-house training \ncourses; and \n \n(iii)  a database on trade, investment, and services. Initial support will develop a \ndatabase  structure  that  can  produce  enhanced,  predefined  tables  of  key \nmacroeconomic and regional economic integration indicators. It will underpin an \ninteractive statistical tool accessible from the ASEAN website. A later phase will \ndevelop a more sophisticated information management system to monitor AEC \nimplementation.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will consist of three major activities to support BEIF of ASEC: (i) research \nsupport, (ii) capacity development support, and (iii) database development. These activities will \nbe  integrated  and  mainstreamed  within  the  BEIF  business  process.  Two  international \nconsultants will be engaged and deployed to BEIF in Jakarta. One, a macroeconomist, will be \nassigned to the macroeconomic surveillance unit of BEIF. The other, a trade economist, will be \nassigned to the FTA Unit of BEIF. The two consultants will also serve as overall coordinators for \nASEAN economic integration, including implementation of the AEC. The TA will also provide \ntwo national consultants to support the BEIF-based consultants. \n ", "4   \n \n15.  The  TA  also  provides  a  separate  budget  allocation  to  engage  the  services  of \ninternational  consultants  in  relevant  fields  on  a  as  needed  basis  and  to  support  capacity \ndevelopment  activities.  The  budget  will  be  equally  allocated  between  the  macroeconomic \nsurveillance and FTA units of BEIF, and will be managed by the Office of Regional Economic \nIntegration (OREI). Disbursement to BEIF will be based on a work plan prepared every 6 \nmonths and agreed upon in advance by OREI and BEIF. Among others, the work plan will \nidentify clear outcomes and outputs, priority capacities, including both technical skills (e.g., \nmacroeconomics/trade economics) and policy-oriented skills, and determine mechanisms for \ncapacity development. Relevant ASEAN bodies such as the Senior Economic Officials Meeting \n(SEOM)  and  ASEAN  Deputy  Finance  Ministers  Meeting  (DFMM)  would  be  consulted  in \npreparing the work plan to ensure that emerging needs in 6 months would be reflected as much \nas possible. However, there will also be flexibility to address unforeseen issues that may arise \nduring the implementation of the work plan. These unforeseen issues would have to be first \nagreed upon by relevant ASEAN bodies before being reflected in the work plan. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total estimated cost of the TA is $720,000, of which $600,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The cost will cover \nremuneration, travel, and per diem of consultants; research; database-building; publication and \nmiscellaneous expenses.  ASEC will provide the balance of $120,000 (in kind) to cover office \naccommodation, administrative support, local staff salaries, and other overhead expenses. A \ndetailed cost breakdown and proposed financing plan are in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be executed by ADB and managed by OREI, in close collaboration with the \nSoutheast Asia Department (SERD). The regional TA is expected to start in May 2007 and be \ncompleted in April 2008, spanning 12 months.   \n \n18.  Two BEIF-based consultants will be supervised by OREI and will report directly to OREI \nfor major assignments. However, consultants\u2019 day-to-day work will be administered by BEIF. \nThe consultants\u2019 reporting system will be specified by OREI and BEIF. All consultants will be \nengaged by ADB on an individual basis and in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2006, as amended from time to time).  \n \n19.  The BEIF-based consultants are expected to (i) prepare (or assist in preparing) policy \nbriefs  on  topics  identified  by  ASEC  and  agreed  to  by  ADB;  (ii)  assist  in  monitoring  and \ncoordinating ASEAN economic cooperation and integration initiatives, including development of \na  database  for  ASEC  to  monitor  ASEAN  economic  integration;  and  (iii)  provide  in-house \ncapacity development  support. An outline of qualifications and terms of reference (TOR) of the \nconsultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  Detailed  TOR  will  be  developed  when  the  TA  is  being \nimplemented. \n \n20.  BEIF will (i) regularly apprise OREI on the research and training needs of its staff and \n(ii) recommend to OREI research topics and training activities to be undertaken. Consultation \nbetween BEIF and OREI will be held every 6 months to prepare work plans and to thoroughly \nmonitor and evaluate the progress of the TA.   \n \n ", "  5\nIV.
