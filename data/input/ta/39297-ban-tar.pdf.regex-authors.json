INTRODUCTION \n1.  Over the last few decades, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided broad-based \nassistance to the Government of Bangladesh to develop the country\u2019s education sector, covering \nprimary, secondary, nonformal, and vocational education as well as skills training programs.  At the \nrequest of the Government, a technical assistance (TA) to support the capacity development of \nmadrasah1 education is included in ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for 2006\u20132010;2 was \nconfirmed during the Country Programming Mission, 23 April\u201311 May 2008; and is included in \nADB\u2019s 2008 TA program for Bangladesh.3 Accordingly, a TA Fact-Finding Mission fielded on 13\u2013\n27 July 2008 reached an understanding with the Government on the rationale, scope, outcomes \nand outputs, methodology, implementation arrangements and timeframe, cost and financing plan, \nand terms of reference for the TA project, Capacity Development for Madrasah Education. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Education Sector. The school education system consists of: (i) early childhood education \n(ages 3\u20135) in formal schools, (ii) 5 years of primary education (grades 1\u20135), (iii) 3 years of lower \nsecondary education (grades 6\u20138), (iv) 2 years of secondary education (grades 9\u201310), and (v) 2 \nyears  of  higher  secondary  education  (grades  11\u201312).  Nonformal  education  programs  do  not \nnecessarily follow the structured system, may have varying duration, and may or may not confer \ncertification. Two streams of madrasahs cover the primary and secondary levels\u2014the Aliyah and \nQoumi/Kharzi. The Madrasah Education Ordinance of 1978 provided the legal and institutional \nframework for regulating Aliyah madrasahs through establishment of the Bangladesh Madrasah \nEducation Board (BMEB). These madrasahs have been recognized as a parallel formal education \nsystem under the overall supervision of the Ministry of Education (MOE) through BMEB. Aliyah \nmadrasahs are privately initiated and operated by managing committees approved by BMEB. Their \nstructure follows the same grade levels as Bangladesh\u2019s formal education system: (i) ibtedaye \n(primary level, grades 1\u20135), (ii) dakhil (junior secondary level, grades 6\u20138 and secondary level, \ngrades 9\u201310), (iii) alim (higher secondary, grades 11\u201312), (iv) fazil (Bachelor\u2019s degree level, grades \n13\u201314), and (v) kamil (master\u2019s level, grade 15\u201316). The fazil and kamil levels are affiliated with the \nIslamic University in Kushtia.   Quomi madrasahs are private institutions, having developed outside \nthe  government  regulatory  framework  (Appendix  4  shows  various  types  of  madrasahs  in \nBangladesh).  \n  \n3.  There are structural issues related to the madrasah education subsector. Although the \nMinistry of Primary and Mass Education (MoPME) is responsible for formal and nonformal primary \neducation  in  Bangladesh,  it  is  not  responsible  for  overseeing  the  primary  level  of  madrasah \neducation. Instead, MOE is responsible for secondary, higher, technical, and vocational education, \nas well as for all madrasah education, including ibtedaye. Therefore, the institutional framework to \nenforce government regulation is lacking for kindergartens and nonregistered and nongovernment \nschools\u2014as well as ibtedaye and Qoumi madrasahs. Moreover, the National Curriculum and \nTextbook Board (NCTB), under MOE, responsible for curriculum and textbooks for both primary \nand secondary education, is not responsible for madrasah curriculum development. Given this \nstructure, the Government\u2019s policy for madrasah education, and the inter- and intra-ministerial \ncoordination mechanism for providing effective and equitable education for all, must be reviewed.  \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Madrasah is the Arabic word of any type of school, secular or religious. In Bangladesh, it connotes a religious Islamic \nschool or university.  \n2  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132010): Bangladesh. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 August 2008. \n ", "2   \n4.  Government Priority and Policy. The Government aims to modernize and mainstream \nmadrasah  education  as  an  expressed  policy  objective.  This  is  reflected  in  the  Government\u2019s \nPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper,4 as madrasahs mainly serve the country\u2019s poor and rural \nchildren and lag behind formal general education in teaching and learning quality. The Poverty \nReduction Strategy Paper provides strategic directions for all sectors to maximize overall social \ngains, including accelerated poverty reduction and achievement of Millennium Development Goals. \nThe country has also committed to the Education For All Principles, contextualized these goals for \nBangladesh,  and  undertaken  various  measures  to  improve  access  to  primary  and  secondary \neducation. The Government has also committed to bringing all Qoumi madrasahs and boards \nunder a regulatory framework and has initiated dialogues with their leadership since 2005.  \n \n5.  Access and Equity. Bangladesh has made considerable progress in improving access to \nformal primary education and nonformal education. It achieved primary education gross and net \nenrollment rates of 98.8% and 91.0%, respectively, in 2007, and the Millennium Development Goal \nof gender parity in primary and secondary education has also been achieved. However, there are \nno precise data on the number of madrasahs and their enrollment. According to the Bangladesh \nBureau of Educational Information and Statistics (BANBEIS), in 2005, the total number of dakhil to \nkamil madrasahs was 9,214, with 3,453,221 students attending (52% female).5 In 2006, the \nnumber of ibtedaye madrasahs attached to dakhil madrasahs was 9,169, with 2,900,000 ibtedaye \nstudents and 1,600,000 dakhil students.6 About 10% of Bangladesh\u2019s secondary school population \n(ages 11\u201315 for grades 6\u201310) was enrolled in madrasahs in 2005.  \n \n6.  The dropout rate is 76% for both genders, with 82% for females, and is very high at the \ndakhil level. The internal efficiency rate was only 29% in 2005 for grade 6\u201310 madrasah students. \nThe completion rate at the dakhil level is estimated at 23.8% for both sexes and only 17.9% for \nfemales.  Two  indicators  for  assessing  external  efficiency  are  (i)  the  relative  acceptability  of \nmadrasah graduates for admission to higher education in competitive subject areas, and (ii) gainful \nemployment.  However,  these  data  are  not  available.  Qoumi  madrasah  graduates  are  trained \nmainly to fill religious positions in mosques, while Aliyah madrasah graduates have to compete for \nmarket jobs.   \n  \n7.  Education Management Information System. Most research studies up to 2007 indicate \nthat the available madrasah data do not provide complete coverage. Qoumi madrasah data are not \ncollected regularly by any government agency. Although BANBEIS publishes detailed data on \nregistered madrasahs, including ibtedaye madrasahs attached to dakhil madrasahs, and very basic \ndata on independent ibtedaye madrasahs, primary education data published by MoPME do not \ninclude any ibtedaye madrasah data. Therefore, there is a need to streamline the data collection \nand dissemination system under one institution, preferably BANBEIS, to ensure consistency and \naccuracy and to provide a holistic picture of Bangladesh\u2019s education sector.  \n \n8.  Madrasah  Curriculum.  Aliyah  madrasahs  expound  religious  education  with  the  \nBMEB-adapted national curriculum. Certificates granted by BMEB after completing dakhil public \nexaminations are recognized by the Government as equivalent to secondary school certificates. In \naddition, certificates granted after completing alim are equivalent to higher secondary certificates. \nStudents who complete the dakhil and alim levels can be admitted to the general formal education \n                                                 \n4  Planning Commission, Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh. 2005. Unlocking the Potential: National \nStrategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction. Dhaka. \n5  BANBEIS. 2006. Bangladesh Educational Statistics 2006. Dhaka (pages 46 and 48).  \n6  Unpublished document by BMEB. No gender segregated data are available in this document, though BMEB has all the \ndata by gender. According to BANBEIS, the number of dakhil madrasahs was only 6,685, of which 1,017 or 15% were \nfemale madrasahs. The total students in dakhil madrasahs were 2,236,025, with 52% female students. There were a \ntotal of 1,678,172 students enrolled in ibtedaye madrasahs, with 48% being female.   \n ", "  3\nstream, but there are no data on how many enroll in general formal education. Some Qoumi \nmadrasahs follow the national curriculum, at least at the primary level. To be recognized by  \nreligious community, good quality Qoumi madrasahs register themselves with Befaqul Madarisil \nArabia Bangladesh7 or other similar religious education boards, and follow the curricula approved \nby those boards. However, the competency skills of madrasah graduates are generally perceived \nto be much lower than those of formal education students due to poorer quality teaching and \nlearning processes and inputs.  \n \n9.  Teacher Training. Most Aliyah madrasah teachers are not well-trained. According to a \nBANBEIS  survey,8  they  possess  lower  qualifications  than  their  general  formal  schoolteacher \ncounterparts. About 25.00% of madrasah teachers have higher secondary certificates or lesser \nqualifications, and 26.50% have undergraduate degrees. In the general formal education system, \n72.50% of teachers have higher secondary certificates, and 71.92% have undergraduate degrees. \nFurther,  training  opportunities  for  madrasah  teachers  are  rare.  The  Bangladesh  Madrasah \nTeachers  Training  Institute  conducts  about  3  weeks  of  short  training  courses  with  its  limited \ncapacity,  and  only  about  10%\u201314%  of  madrasah  teachers  receive  this  training.9  Madrasah \nstudents\u2019 performance in comparison with that of general formal education students, quality inputs \nthat madrasahs receive in relation to those of general formal education, madrasahs\u2019 contributions \nwithin the general education system, and improvements needed to strengthen madrasah students\u2019 \nlearning outcomes must be assessed.   \n \n10.  Limited  Capacity  of  BMEB.  BMEB  has  severe  organizational  and  human  capacity \nconstraints, affecting its management of the madrasah subsector. At the operational level, BMEB is \nresponsible for designing curricula, holding examinations, registering madrasahs, contracting out \ntextbook production, and distributing textbooks. BMEB has a small number of staff in its nine zonal \noffices under an Assistant Inspector, to administer madrasah registration and Board examination \nmatters. Moreover, huge staff shortages are impacting BMEB\u2019s day-to-day activities regarding \nAliyah madrasah oversight.  \n \n11.  Financing Madrasah Education. Aliyah madrasahs generate funds from various sources; \nabout 15.5% from student fees, 2.0% from property income, 5.0% from public donations, and \n78.0% from the Government\u2019s salary support. However, ibtedaye sections of dakhil madrasahs \nonly receive Tk500 subvention whereas general formal education teachers receive Tk3500. Since \nsalary subvention is dependent on the qualifications, most madrasah teachers do not qualify for \nsimilar subventions as their mainstream counterparts. Madrasah superintendents do not receive \nthe same salaries as head teachers within the formal education system scale because they often \ndo  not  have  bachelor  of  science  in  education  degrees.  Quomi  madrasahs  generate  revenue \nthrough donations from individuals and local and international Islamic organizations; some have \ntheir  own  trusts,  foundations,  and  other  income-generating  resources.  Others,  such  as  Iqra \nBangladesh, are dependent on students\u2019 fees and donations by the community. Often, after paying \nteachers\u2019 salaries, funds are not available for non-salary quality inputs such as teaching aids and \nlibrary books. Furthermore, madrasahs usually have poor bookkeeping and fund management \nskills and require skills for efficiency and transparency in managing funds.  \n \n12.  External Aid to Madrasah Education. There were no targeted interventions by external \naid agencies to modernize or mainstream madrasahs in Bangladesh. Further, no comprehensive \nassessment of the madrasah subsector has been undertaken; some minor studies have been \n                                                 \n7  Madrasah Board for some Quomi madrasahs. \n8  BANBEIS. 2006.

There is an assumption that some Qoumi madrasahs receive \nexternal funds from the Middle East, but no data are available on the size, providers, or means of \nprovision. Although ADB has funded several projects and programs in the education sector, none \nhave  been  designed  to  address  access  and  quality  issues  in  the  madrasah  subsector \ncomprehensively. Moreover, the subsector's issues have never been addressed holistically, from a \nsubsector assessment to building the capacity of BMEB and other related agencies. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the TA project will be modernization and mainstreaming of madrasahs at \nprimary and secondary levels leading to improved learning outcomes. The outcomes of the TA \nproject  will be  a  strengthened  BMEB  and  agencies  responsible  for madrasah  education  with \nincreased human, organizational, and institutional capacity. The expected outputs of the TA project \nwill be: (i) a comprehensive analysis of the madrasah subsector, (ii) strategies and a road map for \ndeveloping  the  madrasah  subsector,  and  (iii)  proposals  for  investments  in  priority  areas  for \nmodernizing and mainstreaming the madrasah subsector.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA project will be implemented in two phases over a period of 18 months, tentatively \nfrom April 2009 to September 2010. The first phase will involve: (i) desk reviews and analysis of \navailable published and unpublished documents on government policy and the madrasah system, \nincluding analysis of gaps and needs; (ii) a sample survey and qualitative study to assess status of \nthe  madrasah  subsector  compared  with  the  general  formal  education  system;  and  (iii) \nconsultations with various stakeholders through workshops. The issues related to the management \ncapacity of BMEB and other associated institutions will be assessed during this phase. The output \nof this phase will be a comprehensive sector study for the entire madrasah subsector. During the \nsame phase, an action plan for institutional and organizational capacity development for BMEB \nand other associated institutions, such as BANBEIS, NCTB, and Quomi madrasah boards, will be \ndeveloped and implemented as appropriate. During phase 2, based on the identified gaps and \npriorities  and  sector  study  recommendations,  the  TA  project  will  assist  the  Government  in \ndeveloping  a  medium-  to  long-term  participatory  policy  and  strategic  plan  for  the  madrasah \nsubsector. The output of the TA project at this stage will include: (i) an agreed process for policy \nreform for the madrasah subsector; (ii) a madrasah subsector road map; (iii) a comprehensive \nmadrasah mapping study and complete database installed in the Government\u2019s computer systems; \nand (iv) an agreed financial planning, management, and monitoring framework for reforming the \nmadrasah subsector with detailed budgeting, funding options, and prioritized activities.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,180,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $1,000,000 \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  ADB  will  finance  national  and \ninternational consulting services, production of reports, required equipment, car rental, international \nand local travel, workshops, studies, field surveys, a comprehensive madrasah mapping study and \ndatabase,  and  administrative  support  services.  The  Government  will  contribute  $180,000 \nequivalent in kind as counterpart financing. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  MOE will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and BMEB will be the Implementation \nAgency. The Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE) will be involved with BMEB in \nthe implementation of the TA as required. A TA management unit will be established at BMEB for \nexecution of day-to-day activities. This unit will be headed by a project director, with experience in \npolicy reform and planning as well as madrasah subsector issues, and will be appointed by the \nGovernment to oversee day-to-day operations. A TA steering committee will be established under \nthe  chairmanship  of  the  MOE  secretary  with  representatives  from  the  Bangladesh  Technical \nEducation Board, BMEB, DSHE, Economic Relations Division, Implementation Monitoring and \nEvaluation Division, Ministry of Religious Affairs, Ministry of Women and Children Affairs, MOE \nPlanning Wing, MoPME, and Planning Commission of Bangladesh to provide overall guidance to \nthe TA team. At least two members will be women. It is proposed that the MOE Planning Wing be \nthe overall coordinator of the TA steering committee, and other members may be co-opted as \nappropriate.  It  is  also  proposed  that  representatives  from  development  partners  join  the  TA \nsteering  committee  meetings  as  observers.  The  Government  will  appoint  focal  points  from \nBANBEIS,  BMEB,  DSHE,  MOE,  MoPME,  and  NCTB  to  work  directly  with  the  TA  team  as \nappropriate. The focal points will also attend the TA steering committee meetings as needed. \n \n17.  An international consulting firm, in association with national consultants, will be engaged in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). The selection and engagement of the international consulting firm will be done through \nquality- and cost-based selection using a simplified technical proposal. Disbursements will be \nmade in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.10 An advanced \npayment facility amounting to $55,000 will be established for the Executing Agency in accordance \nwith the ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook for the expenses of workshops, \nmeetings, resource persons, equipment, and administrative expenses. The TA will provide a total \nof 64 person-months consulting services (19 international and 45 national person-months). The \noutline terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 3. All TA-financed goods will be procured \nin line with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).11  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bangladesh for Capacity Development for Madrasah Education, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.    \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2008.

Introduction \n \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) project, Capacity Development for Madrasah Education, \nwill be implemented in two phases over a period of 18 months, tentatively from April 2009 to \nSeptember 2010. The TA project will provide a total of 64 person-months of consulting services \n(19 international and 45 national person-months). The first phase will involve: (i) desk reviews \nand analysis of available published and unpublished documents on government policy and \nBangladesh\u2019s madrasah system, including analysis of gaps and needs; (ii) a sample survey and \nqualitative study to assess status of the madrasah subsector compared to the general formal \neducation system; and (iii) consultations with various stakeholders through workshops. The \nsample survey will involve data collection and appraisal of madrasah facilities, curricula, and \nteaching-learning resources; internal and external efficiency, including dropout and completion \nrates; and quality inputs, such as textbooks, number of trained teachers, learning materials, \ninfrastructure, and transition to competitive subjects at higher education levels and employability. \nThe study will also assess the issues related to the management capacity of Bangladesh \nMadrasah Education Board (BMEB) and other associated institutions. The output of this phase \nwill be a comprehensive study for the entire madrasah subsector. During the first phase, an \naction plan for institutional and organization capacity development for BMEB and associated \ninstitutions will also be developed and implemented.
