INTRODUCTION \n1.  To implement the reform triggers and milestones under subprogram 4 of the second \nFinancial Sector Program Cluster (FSP II), the government has requested capacity development \ntechnical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the National Bank of \nCambodia (NBC), which is the executing agency, and the Ministry of Economy and Finance \n(MEF) and Ministry of Commerce (MOC), which are the implementing agencies. ADB\u2019s country \nstrategy and program, 2005\u201320091 and country operations business plan, 2009\u201320122 have \nsupported ADB\u2019s continued involvement as the lead development partner in the financial sector. \nA combined fact-finding mission to process the subprogram 3 loan together with this TA was \nfielded during 22\u201328 April 2009, and agreement was reached with the government on the TA\u2019s \npurpose,  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  and  financing.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.3  \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND ISSUES \n2.  The development framework for Cambodia\u2019s financial sector is based on the 2001\u20132010 \nFinancial Sector Blueprint that was updated as the Financial Sector Development Strategy \n(2006\u20132015)4 and adopted by the government in February 2007. Through ADB\u2019s first Financial \nSector Program (FSP I), the government was able to lay the legal and regulatory foundations \nnecessary for a sound, market-oriented financial sector. The government took strong measures \nto  consolidate  the  banking  system  and  introduce  more  stringent  requirements  for  capital \nadequacy, governance, and risk management. Since 2001, implementation of the Financial \nSector Blueprint has yielded some notable achievements as well as lessons (from international \nand domestic experience). Those experiences, coupled with new challenges to the financial \nsector, have prompted the government to request continuing ADB support to the sector to \nensure the durability of its reform program and to make the formal financial system more \nefficient and accessible to ordinary citizens. This led to the design and approval of the second \nfinancial sector cluster program (FSP II) in 2007. FSP II comprises a series of four single-\ntranche  subprograms  to  be  implemented  during  September  2006  to  December  2010. \nSubprograms are linked by policy triggers and expected milestones. \n \n3.  With a growing, resilient, and more efficient financial system as the expected outcome, \nFSP II was designed to implement the following reform activities during subprograms 1\u20134: \n  \n(i)  Improve financial intermediation. Includes upgrading the payments, clearance, \nand settlement system to support growing financial services; enhancing market \nconfidence  by  improving  public  financial  disclosure  and  establishing  a  credit \ninformation bureau; supporting market development by establishing an interbank \nmarket and/or tradable government securities; and improving the outreach of \nmicrofinance institutions (MFIs) in a sustainable manner. \n(ii)  Enhance resilience of the financial sector. Includes revising and updating for \nthe  adoption  of  the  law  on  banking  and  financial  institutions,  as  well  as \nintroducing  supportive  regulations  to  strengthen  financial  activities;  tightening \nprudential supervision and regulations of banks and microfinance institutions; \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

Includes implementing international initiatives on \nanti-money  laundering  and  combating  the  financing  of  terrorism;  enhancing \ncorporate governance and transparency in the insurance industry; establishing \ncommercial dispute resolution mechanisms; and improving the capability and \nincreasing the number of qualified national accountants and auditors. \n(iv)  Enhance  efficiency.  Includes  computerizing  the  management  information \nsystem of the NBC, as well as upgrading the skills and capacity of microfinance \nagencies\u2019 staffs.  \n \n4.   To support the implementation of the FSP II medium-term framework, a program of \ntechnical assistance (TA) projects, to be implemented annually, was identified. TA projects for \neach year were to be processed together with the corresponding subprogram loan, when grant \nfinance was available. The primary purpose of these TA projects is to help the government \nimprove  the  capacity  of  the  NBC,  MEF,  and  MOC  to  implement  the  reform  triggers  and \nmilestones  under  FSP  II.  Each  subsequent  TA  project  is  designed  to  continue  where  the \nprevious TA support left off. The TA projects provide technical inputs and targeted on-the-job \nsupport to equip the key government agencies with the required knowledge and skills to ensure \nthat the outputs and outcome of FSP II are achieved and the reforms sustained beyond FSP II.  \n \n5.  A TA for $1.7 million was approved together with subprogram 1 to support NBC, MEF, \nand MOC in implementing the policy and institutional reforms under subprogram 2 and some of \nthe reform triggers and milestones for subprogram 3.5 This TA will end in February 2010 even \nas two of its core activities are still ongoing (upgrading the payments system and installing \nNBC\u2019s integrated information technology system). TA for $300,000 was also approved together \nwith subprogram 2 to continue some activities initiated under the subprogram 1 TA but with a \nfocus on (i) further strengthening on-site supervision and surveillance of the banking system, (ii) \nfurther strengthening off-site and on-site supervision of MFIs, and (iii) strengthening supervision \nand surveillance of the insurance industry.6 This TA is being implemented until January 2010. \nThis TA will consolidate the work began under the subprograms 1 and 2 TA toward completing \ntarget outputs of the FSP II medium-term program. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  FSP II\u2019s overall impact is to promote the development of a sound, market-oriented \nfinancial system in order to enhance resource mobilization and support sustainable economic \ngrowth. The TA will contribute to achieving that goal. The expected outcome for FSP II and the \nTA is a growing, resilient, and efficient financial system. The TA will continue with the ongoing \nimplementation of reform initiatives under subprogram 4 of FSP II that were began by TAs \nunder both subprograms 1 and 2 (footnote 5 and 6) but are yet to be completed.  \n \n \n                                                 \n5  Attached to ADB. 2007.

The  following  provides  a  brief  background  on  contributions  made  by  the  TA  of \nsubprograms 1 and 2 and the components of this TA: \n(i)  Strengthen bank supervision and surveillance. The Subprogram 1 TA has \nhelped NBC adopt an on-site supervision procedure that enables free interface \nbetween the off-site and on-site supervision teams, assisted banks, and other \nfinancial institutions, through NBC, to prepare the type of corporate and financial \ndata required for planning on-site inspections. It has helped NBC establish a \nregistry to track correspondence during planning, field inspection, and completion \nof on-site reviews. The TA also provided on-the-job guidance during inspection of \nthe  five  largest  commercial  banks  from  November  2008  to  June  2009.  The \nSubprogram 2 TA helped NBC strengthen the on-site supervision capacity of the \nbank  regulator  in  tandem  with  implementing  activities  related  to  combating \nmoney laundering and the financing of terrorism, as well as assess the feasibility \nof  rating  major  banks.  This  TA  will  help  guide  NBC  supervision  teams  in \nundertaking  targeted  on-site  follow-up  inspections  to  ensure  that  corrective \nactions recommended by the subprogram 1 TA are addressed and remedial \nmeasures are put in place to deal with high-risk banks that are adversely affected \nby the global economic slowdown and with the flow-on effects on Cambodia\u2019s \neconomy. \n(ii)  Strengthen  supervision  of  MFIs  with  appropriate  regulations.  The \nSubprogram 1 TA has helped NBC improve prudential regulations for MFIs and \nstrengthened  the  capacity  of  the  regulator  within  NBC  to  implement  those \nregulations through both off-site and on-site supervisory activities. An updated \nuniform  chart  of  accounts  was  introduced  in  2008  and  implemented  with \nsubprogram 1 TA support, and a comprehensive review of two MFIs that were \nawarded licenses to mobilize public deposits voluntarily was completed. The \nSubprogram 2 TA continued in 2009 to provide on-the-job training for off-site and \non-site inspection teams, and assisted NBC to develop a code of conduct for \nregistered money changers. This TA will help strengthen coordination between \nthe off-site and on-site supervision staff; update prudential regulations to reflect \nrecent domestic and international developments; provide on-the-job guidance to \non-site inspection staff who will work closely with at least six MFIs; and assist the \nstaff concerned to review the progress on implementing the new uniform chart of \naccounts, review the effects of the global economic slowdown, prepare proper \ndocumentation of those reviews, and discuss the final inspection reports. \n(iii)  Assist in improving the legal and regulatory framework for insurance and \nstrengthen the supervision capacity of staff. The Subprogram 1 TA helped \nMEF and the insurance industry implement the newly adopted accounting and \nreporting framework for insurance firms in 2008. The Subprogram 2 TA helped \nMEF undertake a comprehensive revision of the insurance law and associated \nregulations. Consultations with the industry and related stakeholders were held to \nobtain feedback on the draft revised insurance law and sub-decree before they \nwill be submitted to the Council of Ministers later in 2009. This TA will provide \nlegal advice to MEF during discussions on the draft revised law by the Council of \nMinisters,  assist  with  finalizing  the  revised  implementing  sub-decree  and \nministerial  pronouncements,  and  provide  on-the-job  training  to  staff  of  the \nInsurance Supervision Division. \n(iv)  Assist  with  installing  the  integrated  accounting  system  for  NBC.  The \nSubprogram 1 TA has helped NBC finalize the technical architecture, procure the \nhardware  and  software  systems  through  international  bidding,  evaluate  bids, \nnegotiate contracts, install the hardware and software systems, and conduct \n ", " 4 \ntesting and training. The system is expected to go live by the end of January \n2010.  The  proposed  TA  will  help  provide  NBC  with  troubleshooting  support \nfollowing the go-live phase and provide hands-on training and guidance to the \nuser departments on process changes, maintenance arrangements, etc. \n(v)  Assist with operation of the newly established national arbitration center \n(NAC). The Subprogram 1 TA helped MOC adopt the implementing sub-decree, \nrecruit the founding members of NAC, establish the board and management \nstructure, formulate the rules and administrative procedures, and adopt a code of \nconduct and operating budget for the NAC by the end of 2009. The International \nFinance Corporation is currently providing training to the founding arbitrators. \nThe TA will help the NAC board and management apply the rules, administrative \nprocedures,  and  code of  conduct.  It  will  also  assist  the  NAC  staff  establish \ninternal  records,  develop  a  working  relationship  with  the  municipal  and \ncommercial  court,  and  provide  training  support  as  required  to  ensure  the \nindependent functioning of the NAC. \n(vi)  Assist  MOC  with  adopting  the  draft  commercial  contract  law.  The \nSubprogram 1 TA has supported the government in its efforts to review the \nrequirements  for  a  detailed  set  of  rules  for  commercial  transactions,  review \nrelevant international models and approaches, and draft a new harmonized law \non commercial contracts for submission to the Council of Ministers in 2009. This \nTA will provide legal support to MOC during discussions of the draft law by the \nCouncil of Ministers and National Assembly. It will also assist in finalizing the \nimplementing regulations. \n(vii)  Continue  upgrading  the  national  payment,  clearance,  and  settlement \nsystem (PCSS). The Subprogram 1 TA has helped NBC implement phase 1 of \nthe approved road map for upgrading the national PCSS; guided the Payments \nPolicy Unit (PPU) in consultations with banks that resulted in adoption of the \nrevised  PCSS  road  map;  and  guided  NBC  toward  adoption  of  regulations \ncovering standardized checks, implementation of the interim software solution to \nimprove  the  efficiency  of  check  clearance,  and  adoption  of  clearance  and \nsettlement  rules  and  procedures  in  2009.  This  TA  will  continue  to  provide \npractical guidance to help staff of the PPU, NBC, Treasury, and commercial \nbanks implement the approved revised road map (through legal, technical, and \ncapacity building support) and upgrade the PCSS to a real-time gross settlement \nsystem in the near future. \n(viii)  Assist NBC to establish a credit information bureau. A credit information \nsharing system (CIS) that focused on negative data from banks was established \nunder an ADB program in 2006 to support the credit appraisal processes of \nparticipating banks.7 Rules, regulations, procedures, and a governing structure \nare in place, but implementation has been very challenging. Nevertheless, NBC \nhas continued to resolve systematic issues related to the CIS, strengthened bank \ncompliance, and added MFIs\u2019 reports to the system in 2009. This TA will provide \nNBC  with  practical  guidance  to improve  the  operating efficiency  of  the  CIS, \nupgrade the CIS to include positive credit data, and advise on how to establish a \ncredit bureau as a corporate body with private shareholding. \n \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2004.
