THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to Georgia for the Sustainable Urban Transport Investment \nProgram.  \n \n2.  The program targets investments in urban transport and related urban transport services \nacross main cities in Georgia. This will improve connectivity, reduce traffic congestion and \npromote sustainable, safe, reliable and efficient transport.1 \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Georgia has a population of only 4.62 million but is one of the most urbanized countries \nin the Caucasus. Urban areas are the pillars of economic growth and account for 53% of the \ntotal population, nearly 2.5 million people. Urban areas can be divided into three groups: (i) the \nconurbation of Tbilisi and the adjacent city of Rustavi; (ii) the main secondary cities of Batumi, \nGori, Kutaisi, and Poti; and (iii) cities with high tourism potential such as Anaklia, Borjomi, \nGudauri, and Mestia. Although they differ in size, they all have common transport problems: \nrising  traffic  congestion,  pollution,  poor  and  inappropriate  road  infrastructure  and  highly \ninefficient urban transport systems. Tbilisi, the capital and largest city, is home to 30% of the \nnational population and generates 50% of Georgia's gross domestic product. It is also the main \nemployment center. A problem tree analysis linked to the design monitoring framework (DMF) is \nshown in Appendix 1. \n \n4.  Urban  environment  and  mobility  patterns. Urban sprawl takes place in all urban \nareas and low-density developments are mushrooming along main road networks, creating car-\ndependent communities. Tbilisi is the most affected. Located in a valley with mountains on two \nsides, its infrastructure and traffic flows converge in a single corridor. This fuels high urban \nmobility, severe traffic congestion, poor air quality, and excessive noise, a pattern repeated \nacross other cities. \n \n5.  Safety. Recent high economic growth has led to a sharp increase in car ownership.2 \nThis trend is likely to continue, aggravating the congestion problem. Greater car ownership and \npoor quality transport infrastructure have led to rise in the number of accidents. Death and injury \nrates are higher than in comparable cities in Europe and Asia. For the whole of Georgia, there \nwere 737 deaths and 7,349 injuries from traffic accidents in 2007 (53% of which occurred in \nTbilisi), a 62% increase since 2002. About 80% of pollution derives from motorized transport, \nmuch of which comprises secondhand cars. \n \n6.  Traffic  management  and  parking.  Despite  improvements  to  major  arteries  in  the \ncapital, the traffic signal system is outdated and inadequate. Illegal parking on pavements and \nbusy streets is frequent. Tbilisi and other cities lack controlled parking places and sound parking \npolicies. There are limited arrangements for cyclists and pedestrians, often the first victims of \ntraffic accidents. \n \n7.  Public transport. Public urban transport in all cities relies heavily on microbuses and \nbuses. Microbuses constitute 47% of public transport in Tbilisi and nearly 80% in other major \ncities. These often duplicate existing bus lines and provide a poor service and minimal comfort. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to Georgia for Preparing the Sustainable Urban Transport Project. Manila. \n2  About half of the total personal vehicles in Georgia are registered in Tbilisi (about 275,000 in 2008). ", "2 \nA rationalization of bus and microbus networks is necessary, especially in Batumi, Kutaisi, \nRustavi, and Tbilisi. A new tendering process and criteria to award permits and concessions is \nneeded. In particular, it is essential to focus on quality of service and on the strict respect for \nidentified routes and stops. In Tbilisi, the public transport network has deteriorated. Further, \ntrams and trolleybus services have been discontinued. The urban transport network in the \ncapital comprises a two-line metro system, 125 bus routes, and 188 microbus routes operated \nby public and private companies. The two T-shaped metro lines were designed as the backbone \nof the city transport system and carry 260,000 passengers daily. Improvements to the rolling \nstock have been made since 2007. In 1985, its green line was extended and in 2000 a new \nstation at Vazha-Pshavela was opened. However, an extension to the university district was \nnever completed. This is creating traffic bottlenecks in the area. Although a modern ticketing \nsystem has been introduced, management, marketing and commercial operations are weak. In \nJuly 2009, a significant milestone was reached in network integration through the merger of the \nmetro and bus companies. The reorganization is ongoing and efficiency and productivity gains \nare expected in the short term. \n \n8.  Sector policy, strategy and roadmap. The central government wants the cities to be \nthe engine of economic growth and job creation. The government emphasizes city cluster \ndevelopment and the delivery of quality infrastructure and urban services. These are considered \nessential  to  increase  quality  of  life,  attract  investment  and  increase  productivity  and \ncompetitiveness.  The  strategic  vision  is  shared  by  all  municipalities.  In  this  regard,  the \nGovernment has been working out an urban renewal strategy and supporting business plan. \nThe work is complete, although some refinements to both will be needed overtime. Urban \ntransport and various related services lie at the core of this strategy and business plan. A policy \nframework  is  in  place  for  this  purpose.  It  outlines  key  guiding  principles  and  criteria  for \ninvestment  and  follow-up  operations,  including  competition,  private  sector  involvement, \nefficiency, fairness, transparency, environmental sustainability, value for money with regard to \ncapital investment, maintenance and sound service provision.  \n \n9.  The long term investment program underpinning the urban strategy amounts to $1.1 \nbillion. This is an estimate for the period 2010-2020. A medium term slice of this program (for \n2010-2016) is estimated at $700 million. This is over and above the $400 million already spent \nbetween 2005 and 2010. With regard to urban transport, the target is to improve its reach, \nquality and continuity. It also pursues greater efficiency and tighter environmental safeguards. \nOne policy directive is to favor nonmotorized transport use to reduce pollution, noise, and traffic \naccidents,  and  improve  living  conditions.  The  strategic  objectives  for  urban  renewal  and \ntransport are fully consistent with the strategy agreed by Georgia and ADB for the purposes of \nthe  ADB  assistance  program  in  the  country3 and  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  sustainable  transport \nobjectives.4 The  roadmap  comprises  sequenced  investments,  including  private,  public  and \npublic/private  initiatives.  It  also  includes  municipal  reforms  and  capacity  building  (policy, \nplanning and oversight). The government, the Municipal Development Fund of Georgia (MDF),5 \nand the Tbilisi and other municipalities have asked ADB to help them tackle the urban transport \nproblem  within  the  framework  of  the  urban  renewal  strategy.  The  existence  of  a  policy \nframework, strategy and roadmap also happens to be preconditions for the use by ADB of the \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) as a funding modality. \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2007.

Manila. \n5  Set up in 1997 for a World Bank project, MDF channels donor funding for municipal projects (from EBRD, \nEuropean Union, KfW, Millennium Corporation Challenge, and ADB) and has implemented more than 930 projects.  \n ", "3 \n10.  Donor coordination. The urban sector has been attracting finance and advice from \nother  donors,  including  the  World  Bank  and  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment (EBRD). The former financed transport investments in Tbilisi in 2002 and 2008 \u2013 \nfocusing mainly on road safety, traffic management, and parking. EBRD extended finance for a \nbus company fleet renewal in Tbilisi in 2005 and in Batumi in 2008. EBRD also worked on a \nredistribution of microbus licenses to rationalize routes, upgrade and reduce fleets, and improve \ninformation management systems. ADB has been requested to complement these interventions \nthrough  investments  in  public  transport,  habitat  and  urban  environment,  coastal  waterfront \nrenewal,  road  network  expansion,  traffic  management  and  institutional  reforms.  EBRD  is \nparticularly interested in establishing a strategic alliance with ADB in the Caucasus and other \nparts of Central Asia to expand operations in the urban sector. Other donors (bilateral and \nmultilateral) will also be encouraged to work with ADB for the same purpose. The investment \nrequirements exceed the financing available from any individual institution. ADB will consider \njoint  and  parallel  co-financing  partnerships  throughout  the  implementation  of  the  MFF.  In \nparticular, it will promote public-private initiative in the sector. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  Impact. The investment program and MFF will improve the urban environment, the local \neconomy, and living conditions within urban areas. This will expand economic growth, job \nopportunities and environmental sustainability (See DMF in Appendix 1). \n \n12.  Outcome. The investment program and MFF will improve the efficiency, reliability, and \naffordability of urban transport infrastructure and services (See DMF in Appendix 1). \n \nC.  Outputs \n(i)  Extension, rehabilitation, and improvement of urban transport infrastructure in \nAnaklia, Batumi, Kutaisi, Poti, Rustavi, and Tbilisi (See DMF in Appendix 1). \n \n(ii)  Increased institutional effectiveness, including the reorganization and reforms at \nthe Tbilisi municipality, other municipalities and urban transport service providers \n(See DMF in Appendix 1). \n \n(iii)  Establishment  of  program  management  team  with  a  capability  and  funds  to \nhandle project preparation, technical design, contract bidding, evaluation and \naward, contract supervision, progress monitoring and reporting (See DMF in \nAppendix 1). \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n13.  Investment program. The overall investment program is $1.1 billion (2010-2020). The \nmedium term slice falls just under $700 million (2010-2016). An MFF is the preferred funding \nmodality on account of its flexibility, sequencing of investments and the existence of a sound \npolicy framework, strategy, and roadmap. The size of the MFF is $300 million. This will be \nstructured into three tranches. The first tranche amounts to $85 million. Four subprojects have \nbeen assessed and are ready for implementation (See linked document 14). Tranche 2 will \namount  to  $100  million.  It  has  high  profile  investments  some  of  which  are  already  under \npreparation  (See  linked  document  14).  Tranche  3  is  estimated  at  $115  million  and  the \ninvestments have been already pre-identified. The finance under Tranche 2 and 3 may vary, \ndepending on project readiness and final design features. \n \n ", "4 \nTable 1: Investment Program Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amount \n  Investment Program (2010-2020)   \n  Base Costa   \n  1.

Financing plan. The overall program will be funded mainly by the government and the \nmunicipalities. External finance is only being raised at this stage to support a slice of the \nmedium term investment plan. The government has requested an MFF in an amount up to $300 \nmillion to help finance a part of the investment program. The MFF will consist of several \ntranches,  subject  to  the  government\u2019s  submission  of  related  periodic  financing  requests, \nexecution of the related loan and project agreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms \nand  conditions  and  undertaking  set  forth  in  the  framework  financing  agreement.  The  first \ntranche of the MFF will be financed from ADB's Special Funds resources (Asian Development \nFund ADF), will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an annual  interest \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the loan and project agreements for tranche 1.  \n \n15.  The government has specifically requested flexibility in the use of ADF resources for \nsubsequent tranches. It is understood that the provision of any such additional ADF financing \nwill be accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the available OCR financing, so that in any \nevent the total financing provided by ADB will not exceed the MFF amount of $300 million \nequivalent. Any additional ADF allocation will be subject to (i) the general availability of ADF \nresources from time to time, (ii) Georgia\u2019s access to such resources pursuant to ADB\u2019s then \napplicable Graduation Policy6 and the requirements of the ADF donors, and (iii) the availability \nof such resources to Georgia pursuant to ADB\u2019s then applicable policy on performance-based \n                                                 \n6  Currently: ADB. 2008.

Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The executing agency will be MDF. It has the technical capacity and track record in \nimplementing  donor-financed  projects.  It  will  (i)  procure  and  manage  loan  proceeds,  (ii) \nsupervise  and  monitor  the  implementation  of  investments  under  the  MFF,  (ii)  provide \ncounterpart assistance, and (iii) ensure oversight over environmental and social safeguard \ncompliance. In subsequent tranches, Tbilisi municipality could become the implementing agency \nfor its subprojects. The MDF Supervisory Board, chaired by the Prime Minister, will monitor \nprogress on the MFF. This Board comprises representatives of all relevant government entities. \nIt  will  also  include  representatives  from  regional/municipal  authorities,  as  appropriate.  The \nimplementation arrangements are described in the FAM (See linked document 3). \n \nTable 3: Tentative Implementation Arrangements \n \nAspects  Tentative Arrangements \nImplementation period  September 2010\u2013September 2018 \nEstimated project completion date  30 September 2018 \nProject management     \n(i)  Oversight body  Steering committee/  MRDI, MOF, relevant ministries, \nMDF supervisory board  region and municipalities \n                                                 \n7  Currently: ADB. 2004.

A procurement plan will be prepared for each tranche. All tender documents for tranche \n1 subprojects will be finalized by the end of 2010 (in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines).  As  far  as  possible,  the  contracting  approach  will  be  to  use  turnkey  contracts \ncombining engineering, procurement, and construction (EPCs) modalities. They will have a fixed \ndelivery period, a fixed budget and premiums and penalties against performance and quality. \nThe quality aspects will be checked by independent supervision consultants. The government \nhas requested a waiver from the procurement eligibility requirement to allow it to procure some \nmetro equipment from nonmember countries. This will ensure full component compatibility with \nthe existing system, and thus passenger safety.8 Such procurement will still be carried out \nthrough competitive bidding following ADB rules.  \n \n18.  The MFF as a whole, and the first tranche in particular, includes finance (Component C) \nto support project management, project preparation (subsequent tranche due diligence), design \nwork, project monitoring, reporting and institution capacity building (including support to improve \nplanning, policy formulation and training). Advisory services will be secured for this purpose - \nfrom firms and individuals \u2013 selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \n                                                 \n8 The existing metro network has been built following Soviet metro standards. Technical due diligence has shown that \nsome critical components of the signaling and energy system will need to be procured from nonmember countries. \nThe metro company has traditionally imported such items from nonmember countries. This has been estimated at \nless than 10% of the total financing assigned to this particular subproject. Details are shown in the FAM and will be \nupdated before each PFR. ADB members could supply alternative technology but as the extension represent only \n1.5 km out of 28.5 km, the technological jump for the entire network will be too costly. All other components will be \nprocured from ADB members countries. \n ", "7 \nConsultants. To speed up project implementation, advance contracting and retroactive financing \nof eligible expenditures will also be allowed.9 \n \n19.  Tranche 1 subprojects are as follows: \n(i)  the completion of a 1.5 kilometer (km) Tbilisi metro extension on Vazha Pshavela \nAv.) to the university district serving 150,000 inhabitants;  \n(ii)  the redevelopment of Gorgasali embankment in Tbilisi, including pedestrianized \naccess to the river from the old city to enhance tourism appeal;  \n(iii)  the upgrading of 20 km of the Mestia urban area road network to allow year-\nround accessibility to this United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \nOrganization (UNESCO) heritage site and stimulate tourism; and  \n(iv)  the urban renewal of main avenues in Kutaisi through the introduction of a 26-km \ncycle network to provide transport alternatives. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n20.  Technical due diligence was performed for the investment program and included an \nassessment of the strategy and policy framework, roadmap, investment program, and specific \ninvestment proposals under the first tranche (physical and non physical). The due diligence \nwork confirmed these activities to be in order, sound and of a high quality standard (see linked \ndocument 14). Besides internal ADB staff assessments, independent external consultants were \nalso engaged to help with this work. Due diligence for some tranche 2 subprojects is already \nunder way.10  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) and financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \nfor tranche 1 investments were calculated (see Linked document 7).11 The major economic \nbenefit is savings in travel time. Savings in vehicle operating costs per kilometer and a reduction \nin traffic accidents are also part of this return.12 The analysis showed all subprojects to be \neconomically viable, with EIRRs ranging from 12.6% to 14.4%, and an estimated economic net \npresent value from $1.05 million to $3.90 million at a 12% discount rate. Sensitivity analysis \nconfirmed this economic viability. For most scenarios, EIRR values were above 12%. However, \nfor some subprojects, significant increases in capital costs (20%) or significant decreases in \ntraffic (20%) result in EIRRs of less than 12%. An economic and financial analysis will be \nconducted for all future subprojects financed under the MFF. A financial cost\u2013benefit analysis of \nthe metro extension (included in tranche 1) shows an FIRR of 5.3%. This exceeds the weighted \naverage cost of capital (0.85%). Sensitivity and risk analysis revealed this subproject to be \nsensitive to high revenue and cost variations. \n \n                                                 \n9  The government was informed that expenses under advance contracting can be financed retroactively only if the \nprocedures (including advertising) comply with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. The government acknowledges that ADB\u2019s concurrence with the procedures, documentation, or \nproposals for award does not commit ADB to finance such expenses, or the related project. \n10 Mtkvari bridge in Tbilisi, Anaklia footbridge, Batumi and Anaklia urban waterfront protection measures and Tbilisi\u2013\nRustavi urban road link (Linked document 14). \n11 According  to  ADB.  1997.

Tranche  1  will  directly  benefit  1.53  million  urban  residents  (35%  of  the  national \npopulation  and  66%  of  the  urban  population),  and  will  improve  living  conditions  and  the \neconomic and urban environment of participating municipalities. The potential beneficiaries are \nlocal  residents  without  cars,  students,  commuters,  and  road  and  public  transport  users. \nBusinesses will benefit from greater people mobility and connectivity. The poor and socially \nexcluded will benefit from (i) better access to the city and other activity centers, (ii) affordable \ntransport  alternatives,  (iii)  better  living  conditions  and  less  pollution,  (iv)  employment \nopportunities  from  road  construction  and  maintenance;  and  (v)  development  of  business \nactivities after project completion. The investment program will contribute to poverty reduction by \nstimulating economic development. In particular, it will increase the mobility of 1.4 million people \nliving in Tbilisi. It will generate 1,000\u20131,500 jobs during implementation and promote tourism in the \nparticipating  municipalities.  Employment  targets  for  local  unskilled  workers,  women,  and \nvulnerable  groups  and  core  labor  standards  have  been  included  in  the  Summary  Poverty \nReduction and Social Strategy and Gender Action Plan and will be monitored (See linked \ndocument 9). \n \n24.  Health.  Health  hazards  from  car  pollution  and  traffic  accidents  will  be  reduced. \nReductions in congestion, noise, and exhaust fumes, and an increase in green and pedestrian \nareas will benefit health and quality of life. Shorter travel times and better transport services will \nimprove lives\u2014especially women, the elderly, and children\u2014as they will have better access to \nsocial  services  such  as  schools,  universities,  hospitals,  and  clinics.  Awareness  training  on \nHIV/AIDS  and  sexually  transmitted  infections  is  to  be  included  in  all  civil  works  bidding \ndocuments and will be monitored during the implementation. \n \n25.  Gender. The MFF is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. It will improve \naccess to transport for women. Gender-specific actions are listed in the Gender Action Plan. \nRecommended measures include gender targets for recruitment, capacity building activities, \nconsultation participation. More statistics will be disaggregated by sex. Women will have greater \nrepresentation at the decision-making level in the sector agencies (see linked document 10). \n \nE.  Safeguards \n26.  Environment. An environmental assessment and review framework13 was approved by \nthe  government  on  16  April  2010  (See  linked  document  11).  Four  initial  environmental \nexaminations have been carried out. The environment classification for tranche 1 is B as its \nsubprojects will not have significant irreversible or permanent negative environmental impacts \nduring  or  after  construction.  MDF  will  require  the  contractor  to  refine  and  implement  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  prepared  in  the  initial  environmental  examination, \n                                                 \n13 In compliance with national laws and ADB. 2009. Safeguards Policy Statement. Manila.  \n ", "9 \nincluded in the environmental assessment and review framework. EMP will be an integral part of \nconstruction contracts. \n \n27.  Land acquisition and resettlement. A land acquisition and resettlement framework \nwas approved by the government on 6 February 2010 (See linked document 12). It specifies \ncompensation eligibility and entitlements; land acquisition and resettlement-related conditions \nfor subproject implementation; and mechanisms for the preparation of land acquisition and \nresettlement plans for subprojects entailing land acquisition and resettlement. The resettlement \nclassification  for  tranche  1  is  C  as  no  land  acquisition  and  involuntarily  resettlement  is \nenvisaged for the subprojects. \n \n28.  Indigenous peoples. The investment program area does not include communities that \nmay be defined as indigenous peoples under ADB's Safeguards Policy Statement (2009). The \nindigenous peoples' impact classification for the MFF and all tranche subprojects is C. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n29.  The MFF has limited technical risks. The metro extension and the Gorgasali tunnel \nconstruction will not require sophisticated construction methods. Works on both projects can be \neasily controlled and monitored. Civil works and goods packages will be procured through \ninternational competitive bidding and appropriate performance guarantees will be required from \nthe contractors. MDF has large experience with ADB procurement rules. In addition, it will be \nsupported by an experienced project management team. \n \nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nGorgasali tunnel may encounter archeological  Chance finds procedures will ensure that any cultural or \nremains during construction near the old city.  archeological evidences will be properly handled and preserved. \nUnexpected hydrological disturbances may  Hydrological risk assessment has been undertaken and proper \ncompromise the completion of the metro tunnel and  monitoring is planned.

ASSURANCES \n30.  The government and MDF assure ADB that implementation work will conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement.  These  warranties  and \nrepresentations are described in the FAM and relevant loan documents. The government and \n ", "10 \nMDF have given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF. These are included in a framework \nfinancing agreement (See linked document 1). Specific covenants agreed by the government \nand MDF with respect to individual tranches under the MFF will be included in loan and project \nagreements for respective tranches. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n31.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount not exceeding $300,000,000 equivalent to Georgia for the Sustainable Urban Transport \nInvestment Program comprising: \n \n(i)  loans from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with interest and other terms to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB's then applicable policies relating to Special \nFunds resources, subject to conditions set forth in paragraph 14 of this report; and \n(ii)  loans from ADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest and other terms to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, \n \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe framework financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \n32.  I also recommend that the Board approve the proposal set forth in paragraph 17 of this \nreport that the metro equipment procured from nonmember countries of ADB be eligible for \nfinancing  under  the  Sustainable  Urban  Transport  Investment  Program.  If  the  requisite \naffirmative vote of Directors representing not less than two thirds of the total voting power of \nADB's members, pursuant to Article 14(ix) of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, is not obtained \nfor this recommendation and the Board only approves the recommendation in paragraph 31, \nthen only metro equipment procured from member countries of ADB will be eligible for financing \nunder the Program. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n25 June 2010 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nMULTITRANCHE FINANCING FACILITY \n \n  Indicative Performance  Data Sources and   \nDesign Summary  Targets and Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact  By 2018  -Report on multiple  Assumptions \nImproved urban  -Attractiveness and preservation  Indicators from municipal  The government pursues \nenvironment, expanded  of cultural heritage with 10%  departments, municipal  strategy of growth \nlocal economy, and  increase in tourist nights  companies and NGO  Appropriate environmental \nbetter living conditions  compared to baseline in 2008  -Surveys by Tourism  framework in place \nwithin urban areas  -Reduce urban road accidents  Department or other entities  Political and economic \nand casualties by 5% compared  as appropriate  stability \nto baseline in 2009  -Statistical surveys (MRDI or  Implementation of the \n-Citizens will benefit from project  other agencies as  urban transport MFF as \nconstruction through job increase  appropriate)  planned \n(between 1,000 and 1,500 jobs)  -Surveys by Tbilisi   \n-Private sector involved in  Municipality or other entities  Risk \nconstruction and service  as appropriate  Vulnerability of the \nmanagement    economy to exogenous \n  shocks \n \nOutcome  By 2018    Assumptions \nEfficient, reliable, and  -Program will benefit at least 2.5  -NGO and international or  -Implementation of the \naffordable urban  million people in urban areas  national transport  urban transport road map \ntransport services  compared to base line in 2009  associations reports   as planned \nprovided in relevant  -Increase by 5% of urban  -Municipal statistics  -Prompt decision-making \ncities  population in Tbilisi with direct  Metro, bus companies, or  by the government and \n  access to public transport  other agencies statistics as  releasing counterpart \n  compared to base line in 2008  appropriate   funds, and supporting the \n-Increase in public transport  -MRDI database  capacity development \nridership by 5% compared to    needs of the relevant \n2009 baseline  municipalities \n-Maintain public transport modal  -MDF, Tbilisi, and other \nsplit in Tbilisi at  least at the  municipalities follow \nsame level as 2009 baseline  safeguards policy \n-Increase by 5% number of   \nwomen using municipal urban  Risk \ntransport compared to baseline  -Weak coordination among \nin 2008  government departments \nand relevant municipalities \nundermines sustainable \noperations. \nOutputs:  By 2014    Assumption \n1.
