The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  conducting  an  annual  orientation \nprogram  for  developing  member  country  (DMC)  officials  at  ADB  headquarters  since  1989 \n(except in 1996).1 Over the years, the orientation program has evolved into an intensive 2.5- to \n3.0-week  training  program  focused  on  ADB  policies  and  procedures,  selected  aspects  of \ndevelopment planning, and project management skills. A total of 388 officials from 40 DMCs \nhave participated in the orientation program since its start. (Appendix 1 shows the distribution of \nparticipants, by year and by country.) \n \n2.  As envisioned, the program will continue to give DMC officials a better understanding of \nADB\u2019s changing role in the Asia and Pacific region, and to provide opportunities for participants \nto (i) learn more about ADB policies, procedures, and activities in their countries; (ii) upgrade \ntheir skills in development planning and project management; and (iii) meet and strengthen \nrelationships with ADB staff and counterpart DMC officials. The technical assistance (TA) is \nexpected to make the program more responsive to the fast-changing needs of DMCs. The \nframework in Appendix 2 outlines the key components of this TA, which will also sustain the \nprogram over the next 3 years, from 2007 to 2009.2     \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  ADB\u2019s  medium-term  strategy  II  (MTS  II),  which  translates  its  long-term  strategic \nframework (2001\u20132015) into actionable strategies, covers the 3 years from 2006 to 2008. \nMTS II  has  identified  five  priorities:  catalyzing  investment,  strengthening  inclusiveness, \npromoting  regional  cooperation  and  integration,  managing  the  environment,  and  improving \ngovernance and preventing corruption.  \n \n4.  The new and fast-evolving economic and political environment in the Asia and Pacific \nregion requires a reassessment of the orientation program to ensure that it stays relevant to \nADB\u2019s strategies. The program must develop the capacity of DMC government officials to \nsupport a better quality of life for their citizens. In particular, the program must reinforce ADB\u2019s \nrole in more inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth, with focus on efficiency and \neffectiveness, development results, and capacity development and knowledge sharing.3\n \n5.  There is strong support for continuing the orientation program from participants and ADB \nstaff  who  have  served  as  resource  speakers,  as  it  consistently  achieves  its  objectives  of \nenhancing the DMC officials\u2019 understanding of ADB and improving the relationship between \nADB and DMC counterpart agencies. The program has also provided an opportunity for DMC \nofficials to interact with ADB staff with regard to policies, procedures, and issues related to \nADB\u2019s work in their countries.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Until 1995, the orientation program was referred to as the Special Secondment Scheme. The name was changed in \n1997 to the ADB Orientation Program for Developing Member Country Officials. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 30 March 2006. \n3   In  line  with  ADB.  2001.

Lessons learned from the conduct of the program in the past 3 years (Supplementary \nAppendix)4 form the basis for this TA. Feedback from program alumni and ADB staff suggest \nthe need to evaluate and make improvements in four areas: (i) the design of the program, \nparticularly its focus, methods, and content; (ii) the process of inviting and selecting participants; \n(iii) the roles and responsibilities of ADB units in program planning and implementation; and \n(iv) knowledge sharing.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA will increase the effectiveness of ADB\u2019s development efforts in DMCs and \npromote regional cooperation and integration (RCI) activities by strengthening the capacity of \nDMC officials to plan and manage ADB-assisted programs and projects. \n \n8.  This TA will support three yearly orientation programs in 2007\u20132009 for around 100 \nparticipants from 40 DMCs.5 The orientation program will give ADB a heightened appreciation of \nthe requirements and priorities of DMCs, and deepen the DMCs\u2019 understanding of how they can \npartner better with ADB.  \n \n9.  Specifically, the orientation program for DMC government officials will  \n \n(i)  enhance the DMC officials\u2019 understanding of ADB\u2019s strategic business agenda; \n(ii)  increase  the  DMC  officials\u2019  knowledge  of  ADB\u2019s  policies,  procedures,  and \noperations; \n(iii)  sharpen  the  DMC  officials\u2019  skills  in  planning,  managing,  monitoring,  and \nevaluating development activities; \n(iv)  strengthen  the  relationship  between  DMC  agencies  and  ADB\u2019s  regional \ndepartments and resident missions;  \n(v)  promote relationships and knowledge sharing among DMC officials, within the \nRCI framework; and  \n(vi)  amplify ADB\u2019s understanding of DMC issues and requirements. \n \n \nB.  Methods and Key Activities \n10.  Lessons learned and stakeholder feedback will be used to improve the program and \nmake it more relevant to the needs of DMC officials. Three key outputs of the 2007 program \ndesign and delivery are expected to strengthen the project/program planning and management \ncapacities of DMC officials:  \n \n(i)  updated scope, design, and learning methods for the orientation program; \n(ii)  rationalized management processes for the orientation program; and \n(iii)  revitalized knowledge-sharing network of DMC officials who have participated in \nthe orientation program. \n \n                                                 \n4  Available upon request. \n5  The number of DMCs participating in the program will increase as ADB welcomes new member-countries and as \nDMCs demonstrate a need for additional capacity building in their government agencies. \n ", "  3\n11.  These three outputs will be expected in 2008 and 2009 as part of an ongoing review and \nimprovement process, but the required level of redesign is not expected to be the same as in \n2007. \n \n12.  Updated  Program  Scope,  Design,  and  Methods. The review and assessment of \nprevious orientation programs will define their shortcomings and areas for improvement. The \nprogram will be redesigned to make the best use of updated methods and approaches to adult \nlearning. The updated and agreed scope, design, and methods will be applied in the three \nannual programs to be held in 2007\u20132009. Three months after each program, its outcome will \nbe evaluated with a view to improving the design and development of later programs. The \nevaluation  will  include  a  post-program  review  with  participants,  regional  departments,  and \nresident missions in relation to key goals and objectives. \n \n13.  Rationalized  Orientation  Program  Management.  To  ensure  the  selection  of  the \nappropriate DMC officials for the program, program management processes will be clarified and \nrevised. The number of DMC officials trained under the program will be reviewed and possibly \nincreased in answer to DMC capacity-building needs. Relevant ADB departments and staff will \nbe consulted and their active collaboration will be sought. The consultation and collaboration will \ntake place particularly with the regional departments and the resident missions, and with the \nOffice  of  Regional  Economic  Integration,  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment, and the Strategy and Policy Department. Feedback on program processes will be \nobtained from selected program alumni. The roles and responsibilities of ADB units involved in \nthe  orientation  program  will  also  be  defined  and  disseminated  to  ensure  clear  lines  of \ncommunication and collaboration. \n \n14.  Revitalized Knowledge-Sharing Network of Program Alumni. In recognition of the \npotential  of  the  program  alumni  to  catalyze development  change in  their  DMCs,  ADB  will \nsupport  the  alumni  network  by  providing  opportunities  for  continuous  learning  and  for \ninstitutional capacity building for the management of RCI. On the basis of the feedback and the \nresults of the assessment, ways of revitalizing the program alumni network will be developed. \nLess  than  full  use  has  been  made  of  the  Internet-based  discussion  forum  (DMC  Officials \nCommunity  of  Practice  [CoP])  launched  in  2006  as  a  mechanism  of  collaboration  and \nknowledge sharing. Program alumni who have not joined the online CoP will be invited to sign in. \nOff-line activities (e.g., teleconferences, videoconferences, or live forums) will complement the \nonline forum. \n \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA will cost an estimated $780,000 (Appendix 3). The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The TA will meet the costs of the orientation program for 3 \nyears, from 2007 to 2009. \n \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented from June 2007 to 31 December 2009 by ADB as the \nExecuting Agency. The Human Resources Division of the Budget, Personnel, and Management \nSystems Department will be responsible for managing and implementing the TA. The resident \nmissions will play a key role in coordinating with DMC governments. \n \n ", "4   \n17.  The TA will require the services of international consultants (up to 10.5 person-months) \nand  national  consultants  (up  to  24  person-months).  The  outline  terms  of  reference  are  in \nAppendix 4. The consultants will be selected and hired according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  consultants  will  be  hired \nindividually  for  each  annual  orientation  program.  Being  hired  for  one  program  does  not \nguarantee re-hiring for later programs. \n \n18.  Consultants will be selected on the basis of their experience and capability to learn the \nframework within the culture of ADB as a development bank having a multiplicity of stakeholders \nand operating in an international public sector environment. Considerable skill is required to \nreview, assess, design, and deliver learning and development programs that are relevant and \nperceived as valuable. The consultants should (i) be familiar with ADB\u2019s strategic objectives; \n(ii) have a holistic, dynamic, and systemic approach to consultation; (iii) encourage collaborative \nexchange  and  flexibility;  (iv)  be  highly  skilled  in  adult  learning  methods;  and  (v)  be  fully \ncommitted to excellence. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $780,000 on a grant basis for \nthe 2007\u20132009 Orientation Program for Officials of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Developing \nMember Countries, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "     \nNUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS, BY COUNTRY \n(1989\u20132006) \nCountry  1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006  Total \n1.
