THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nIndian rupee-denominated equity investment in Central Uttar Pradesh Gas Limited (CUGL).  \nThe company has been formed as a joint venture to introduce clean fuels, including compressed \nnatural  gas  (CNG)  for  vehicles  and  piped  natural  gas  (PNG)  for  domestic,  industrial,  and \ncommercial users in the city of Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh (UP), India.   \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n \n2.  Nearly two thirds of India's population lives in urban areas, and nearly half of the urban \npopulation is concentrated in 23 metropolitan areas with populations exceeding 1 million. Urban \nareas  in  India  are  significantly  affected  by  air  pollution,  which  consists  of  fine  suspended \nparticulate matter caused by emissions from mobile and stationary sources. The growth of cities \nand travel have greatly increased the number of gasoline and diesel vehicles on the roads.  \nCongested living conditions and worsening pollution have resulted in chronic health problems \nthat raise health costs and are a drag on economic productivity and efficiency. A 1997 World \nBank study found a significant direct correlation between particulate pollution and non-traumatic \ndeaths, including deaths from specific causes for certain age groups. The study projected that \nincreasing total suspected particulates in New Delhi by 100 milligrams per cubic meter would \nresult in the loss of an estimated 1,385 lives per year.1  Another World Bank study concluded \nthat air pollution in Mumbai annually causes 2,800 premature deaths, as well as 60 million sick \ndays and 19 million restricted-activity days due to respiratory problems, costing Rs18 billion.   \n \n3.  The introduction of natural gas in Delhi was mandated by the Supreme Court of India after \na public interest litigation application filed in 1985,2 drawing attention to the city\u2019s deteriorating \nair quality and the need for urgent action for redress. Noting the lack of effective voluntary action \nby government officials, the Supreme Court directed the Delhi administration to file an affidavit \nspecifying the steps it will take to control air and noise pollution caused by vehicles. One of the \nrecommendations put forward was using CNG to mitigate vehicular pollution. At the instigation \nof the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG), GAIL (India) Limited (GAIL, formerly the \nGas Authority of India Limited) initiated a pilot study to establish the feasibility of CNG as an \nalternative fuel for buses and light commercial and other vehicles. These pilot tests proved \nsuccessful. The Supreme Court imposed directives that diesel buses, taxis, and auto-rickshaws \nin Delhi be converted to CNG. After some teething problems in the early years, there are now \napproximately  10,480  CNG  buses  operating  in  Delhi,  and  pollution  has  been  substantially \nreduced. A similar program initially for taxis and auto-rickshaws was implemented in Mumbai \nand is also now operating successfully. \n \n4.  Regarding court directives issued for Delhi's conversion to CNG, the Supreme Court \nreported in May 2002 that Central Pollution Control Board data indicated that at least nine other \ncities in India, including Kanpur, had critical air quality problems. \u201cBut there appears no effective \nplan to address the problems of the cities,\u201d the Supreme Court added. \u201cIf no immediate action is \ntaken, then it may become necessary for some orders being passed so as to bring relief to the \nresidents of these cities.\" As a result, the Central Government in September 2003 directed GAIL \nto identify the pollution sources, assess the pollution load, and prepare an action plan for each \ncity to control pollution from various sources, including automobiles and industry. \n                                                 \n1  Alberini, A., N. Simon, P.K. Sharma, and M. Cropper, 1997. The Health Effects of Air Pollution in Delhi, India, \nWashington: World Bank Group. \n2  Mehta, M.C. Union of India. WP 13029/1985 (04-05-2002). \n ", "2         \n \n5.  GAIL conducted feasibility studies in September 2002 and has submitted action plans for \nsix cities: Agra, Lucknow, Kanpur, Kolkata, Faridabad, and Pune. The six cities\u2019 selection was \nbased on a combination of air quality and proximity to existing supplies of natural gas or \npipelines. In early 2003, the Government requested a project preparatory technical assistance \n(PPTA) grant from ADB to assist with the further preparation of these projects. In 2003, PPTA \nwas  processed,  approved,3  and  implemented  by  ADB\u2019s  South  Asia  Regional  Department \n(SARD). During implementation of PPTA, it was agreed that the projects would instead be \nfinanced  as  private  sector  joint  venture  companies.  Subsequently,  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector \nOperations  Department  (PSOD)  collaborated  with  SARD  to  finalize  the  PPTA  report  and \nprepare this public\u2013private partnership. ADB issued concept clearance for the Project on 12 \nMay 2005, and the project team fielded a due diligence mission in November 2005. \n \nIII.  BACKGROUND \n \nA.  The Gas Sector in India \n \n1.  Supply and Demand   \n \n6.  According to MoPNG, current recoverable reserves of natural gas in India are estimated \nat about 920 billion cubic meters. However, production has been declining since the 1980s. At \nthe current rate, India has a reserves/annual production ratio of less than 30 years. The majority \nstate-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) and Oil India Limited (OIL) \ndominate gas production with a share of 80%, followed by joint ventures (10%) and private \nsector companies (10%), with most production concentrated off the western shore. In 1986, the \nGovernment established GAIL to address the critical issue of gas infrastructure development. \nUntil then, India lacked the necessary transmission facilities to use the natural gas produced \nwith oil, and the gas had to be flared. In 1987 and 1988, the first large cross-country gas \npipeline system, the Hazira\u2013Bajaypur\u2013Jagdishpur (HBJ) pipeline, was commissioned. The HBJ \ntransmits up to 33.4 million metric standard cubic meters per day (MMSCMD) of gas from the \nwest coast of India to central and northern parts of the country, including Delhi.   \n \n7.  Natural gas represents less than 10% of total consumption of commercial energy in \nIndia. When consumption of such non-commercial fuels as biomass and waste is included, the \nshare of natural gas in total energy consumption is even smaller. In 2002, this was estimated at \n4% of the total primary energy consumed in India. Gas consumption in 2004 was estimated at \n81 MMSCMD, or about 30 billion cubic meters per year, for power generation (40%); producing \nfertilizers (28%), petrochemicals (11%), and steel (5%); other industries (12%); and CNG/city \ngas (4%) (footnote 3).  These figures show gas demand in India dominated by the power sector \nand fertilizers industry, which account for nearly 70% of total consumption. \n \n8.  Gas demand in India remains supply constrained, as there is a significant gap between \ngas  requirements  and  available  indigenous  gas  supplies  plus  liquefied  natural  gas  (LNG) \nimports, for which terminals at Dahej and Hazira have come online in the past 18 months.  \nBecause of this constraint, indigenous gas supplies produced by ONGC and OIL on their own \n(known as administered pricing mechanism, or APM, gas) are allocated to different users by \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to India for Preparing the Urban Clean Fuel Project. Manila (Financed by the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom). ", "  3\nMoPNG  based  on  the  assessment  of  the  inter-ministerial  Gas  Linkage  Committee.4  The \nallocated gas is supplied by ONGC and OIL mostly to energy-intensive consumers in the power \nsector and fertilizers industry for less than international prices. The present official Government \nallocation of gas is about 120 MMSCMD.    \n \n2.  Sector Reform and Policy Framework \n \n9.  Historically,  the  natural  gas  industry  in  India  has  been  highly  centralized  and \nGovernment controlled. However, in the past few years the Government has initiated a number \nof reform and policy initiatives to make the industry more competitive and market oriented, \nincorporating both public sector oil and gas companies and private investors. In 2000, the \nGovernment constituted a group to chart a course for significantly developing the country\u2019s \nhydrocarbon potential. Under the chairmanship of the finance minister, the group produced the \nHydrocarbon Vision 2025 Report, which detailed a roadmap for developing this sector. The \nreport recommended pursuing LNG imports to fill the supply deficit. It suggested encouraging \ndomestic companies to participate in the LNG chain, rationalizing customs duties on LNG, and \nleveling the field for all gas players. It also recommended creating a policy framework for \ncleaner fuels. The report sought to open the hydrocarbon market and so allow free and fair \ncompetition among public sector enterprises, private companies, and other international players, \nas well as establish a long-term fiscal policy to attract foreign investment in the sector. Such a \ncompetitive environment would also require a regulatory and legislative framework, including a \nrational tariff and pricing policy to ensure consumers affordable prices while at the same time \ngradually phasing out existing price subsidies. \n \n10.  The Government introduced the Petroleum Regulatory Board Bill in Parliament in May \n2002 to establish an independent regulator for gas and petroleum products. The bill provides for \nestablishing a Petroleum Regulatory Board to oversee and regulate the refining, processing, \nstorage, transportation, distribution, marketing, and sale of hydrocarbon products, excluding the \nproduction of crude oil and natural gas. The basic objective of the bill is to provide a regulatory \nmechanism to facilitate uninterrupted supplies of petroleum, petroleum products, and natural \ngas for all parts of the country at a fair price. It also aims to promote competition in the market \nand  access  for  all  entities  to  the  monopolistic  infrastructure  by  making  it  a  common, \nnondiscriminatory carrier. The bill includes provisions setting service obligations for retail outlets \nand marketing service obligations for companies. Further details on the gas sector and sector \nreform in India are in Appendix 2. \n \n3.  CNG in India \n \n11.  CNG is compressed to a pressure of 200\u2013250 kilograms per cubic meter for practical \nstorage in cylinders onboard vehicles. It is a clean fuel with relatively low emissions of sulfur \noxide, nitrous oxide, and suspended particulate matter. CNG vehicles are increasingly gaining \nacceptance, particularly as urban taxis, buses, and delivery vehicles because they have lower \nrunning and maintenance costs than diesel and gasoline. GAIL introduced CNG in Delhi in 1994 \nunder a pilot scheme. Based on this success, Indraprastha Gas Limited (IGL) was established \nas a joint venture company5 in December 1998 to take over the CNG implementation begun by \nGAIL under MoPNG directives. Initially, IGL was allocated 0.48 MMSCMD of gas in 1998, which \n                                                 \n4 The committee includes the Planning Commission, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Power, Ministry of Chemicals \nand Fertilizers, and Ministry of Steel. \n5  IGL is owned 22.5% by GAIL, 22.5% by BPCL, 8.75% by Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation Limited, \n8.75% by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Trust Company, 5.0% by the Government of the National \nCapital Territory of Delhi, and 28.5% by public and other investors. ", "4         \nwas eventually increased to 0.98 MMSCMD in July 2001 and to 2.00 MMSCMD in April 2002 \nbased on the Supreme Court\u2019s directive. The natural gas project is considered a success, and \nIGL remains very profitable. Driven by its success, IGL is expanding to the areas surrounding \nDelhi such as Noida, Greater Noida, Gurgaon, and Faridabad. Similar CNG implementation was \ncarried out concurrently in Mumbai by Mahanagar Gas Limited. \n \n4.  Lessons Learned \n \n12.  Some problems were experienced in early years of CNG implementation. First, the move \nto CNG was driven by the Supreme Court decision rather than market economics, and the \ninvolvement of many Government agencies and departments slowed planning, coordination, \nand implementation. There was a mismatch between supply and demand, of both fuel and \nassociated infrastructure, including insufficient vehicle conversion kits, the late delivery of new \nCNG buses, and the lack of safety inspectors for CNG cylinders. In addition, IGL was unsure \nhow many vehicle conversions were taking place, and so only a limited number of CNG stations \nwere constructed.6 At those that were built, the filling equipment experienced breakdowns. High \ndemand reduced the pressure at daughter stations, which extended refueling time.7 This caused \nlong queues once the Supreme Court restriction on diesel public transport came into effect. \nHowever, these problems were eventually overcome. There are now 134 CNG stations and \nover  94,000  vehicles  using  CNG,  including  10,480  buses.8  Lessons  learned  from  the  IGL \nexperience, and the Mahanagar Gas Limited experience in Mumbai, have been incorporated \ninto the CUGL design in terms of timing the construction of CNG stations, using online stations \nrather  than  daughter  stations,  and  providing  for  much  wider  availability  in  India  of  CNG-\nassociated equipment and conversion kits. \n \n13.  For the successful introduction of natural gas, both CNG and PNG, adequate planning \nfor physical infrastructure and financial incentives must be in place to ensure conversion occurs \nat  the  targeted  rates.  The  conversion  of  buses  was  dictated  by  judicial  intervention  and \nsupplemented by financial incentives by the Delhi Transportation Board, but conversion of taxis \nand auto-rickshaws was driven by market economics, namely the favorable price of CNG vis-\u00e0-\nvis gasoline and reasonable conversion costs. The conversion cost of buses was much higher, \nand  the  price  differential  between  diesel  and  CNG  was  not  sufficient  to  justify  the  longer \npayback period.   \n \n14.  In the case of Kanpur, the state government of UP has proposed the draft UP Gas Uses \nand  Distribution  Policy  (2005),  which  was  formulated  to  ensure  that  the  development  and \npromotion of clean fuels is not stalled for lack of a legal framework and sufficient incentives. The \npolicy would include  \n(i)   establishing a single nodal state agency9 for clearances and coordination;  \n(ii)   a  30\u201350%  subsidy  for  kits  to  convert  auto  rickshaws,  taxis,  buses,  and \ncommercial vehicles;10  \n                                                 \n6  These  stations  experienced  additional  construction  problems  such  as  delays  in  land  acquisition,  statutory \npermissions, and electricity connections. \n7  The mother station takes gas from the main supply pipeline, compresses it and delivers it to dispensers (online \nstations) and mobile cascades. Cascades are then transported to the daughter stations. The gas may be \ndispensed directly from the cascades or compressed with a small compressor to increase storage capacity.  This \nlatter arrangement is called a daughter booster station.  \n8  Annual Report, 2004-2005. Indraprastha Gas Limited. \n9  The Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Corporation will act as the Uttar Pradesh State Gas Development \nand Regulatory Agency until such time as a more formal UP regulatory board can be established. \n10  A 50% subsidy will be provided for kits to convert auto rickshaws and the smallest commercial vehicles (tempos), \n40% for taxis, and 30% for buses and trucks.  ", "  5\n(iii)   agency authority to levy a tax if required on such petroleum products as gasoline \nand diesel to generate funds for providing subsidies for CNG conversion; and  \n(iv)   a trade tax waver for CNG conversion kits and an entry tax waver for natural gas. \n \nIn addition, the Road Transportation Office in Kanpur has indicated that public vehicles that \nhave  not  converted  to  CNG  will  not  receive  new  vehicle  registration  licenses  or  renewal. \nRegarding conversion to PNG, the program has been largely successful in Delhi solely because \nof the price discount relative to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene and the improved \nsafety of PNG connections. It is envisaged that CUGL will price PNG at a minimum 10% \ndiscount to competing fuels. \n \nB.  ADB Operations \n \n1.  ADB\u2019s Country Strategy for India \n \n15.  As for most ADB developing member countries, mainstreaming poverty reduction is the \noverarching theme of India\u2019s Country Strategy and Program (CSP) and subsequent updates \n(CSPUs), the most recent of which was approved by the Board in November 200511. The \ndocuments draw upon the three pillars of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy: pro-poor growth, \nsocial development, and good governance. The strategy aims to support the Government\u2019s \nhigh-growth agenda by assisting fiscal consolidation, infrastructure development, and private \nsector  development.  The  CSP  emphasizes  investments  in  publicly  provided  infrastructure, \nincluding hydrocarbons, to remove key bottlenecks where private investment is not forthcoming. \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s Energy Sector Strategy for India \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s assistance for the energy sector, as outlined in the 2005 CSPU, has six main \npriorities:  (i)  power  sector  reform;  (ii)  promotion  of  high-efficiency  and  low-carbon  power \nsources;  (iii)  expansion  and  optimization  of  transmission  and  distribution  systems;  (iv) \ninstitutional strengthening to implement reforms required by the Electricity Act of 2003, including \nthe development of more flexible power delivery and trading systems; (v) promotion of private \nsector participation; and (vi) encouraging energy conservation and ensuring environmental and \nsocial sustainability. The Project addresses several of these priorities, as it involves a private \nsector company implementing a city gas distribution system that offers direct environmental and \nsafety benefits to the local population. The 2006 CSPU reinforces the importance of private \nsector investment for India\u2019s growth and indicates that PSOD should focus on infrastructure \nsectors including energy (electric power, oil, and gas), transport, telecommunications, water and \nwaste water, urban services, special economic zones, and soft infrastructure such as education, \nhealthcare, and information technology. The program update also indicates that PSOD will work \nwith  SARD  to  develop  public\u2013private  partnerships  in  the  infrastructure  sectors,  specifically \nmentioning urban clean fuels projects.  \n \n3.  The Project\u2019s Consistency with ADB Strategies \n \n17.   The Project is in line with ADB\u2019s country, energy sector, private sector development, \nand environmental protection strategies. As a public\u2013private partnership, the Project is the first \nstep toward the introduction of clean fuels in major cities other than Delhi and Mumbai, where \nsuch project implementation has proved successful. The Project augments the supply of clean, \nenvironmentally friendly natural gas, which will displace more polluting fuels such as diesel, \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2005.  India: Country Strategy and Program Update (2006-2008). ", "6         \nkerosene, and gasoline. The Project has led to establishing CUGL under the Companies Act \n1956. ADB has been involved in developing these projects since 2002, and its financing of the \nProject is the culmination of joint efforts by SARD and PSOD. \n \nIV.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Description \n \n18.   The Project involves constructing a city gas distribution network in Kanpur to deliver CNG \nfor vehicles and PNG to commercial, industrial, and residential users. The Project has two main \ncomponents: (i) constructing a limited natural gas distribution network within the city and PNG \ncustomer connections and (ii) establishing a CNG mother station and online filling stations to \nservice cars, buses, taxis, and two- and three-wheelers that have been converted to use CNG. \nThe gas will be supplied from a tap-off point 18 kilometers away, near Sachendi on the GAIL-\noperated  HBJ  pipeline,  from  which  a  feeder  line  then  connects  to  the  city  gate  station  at \nFazalganj. The feeder line from the tap-off point and city gate station has already been completed \nby GAIL, the gas supplier. \n \n19.  CUGL  proposed  to  construct  online  stations  with  gas-driven  compressors  instead  of \ndaughter booster stations because the electricity supply required to power such a configuration is \nunreliable and traffic congestion would inhibit the safe transportation of the cascades. The gas \npipelines shall be laid along road shoulders requiring permission only from state agencies and/or \nlocal authorities. The development of gas distribution connections also will be phased according to \ndemand.  \n \nB.  Ownership \n \n20.   A joint venture agreement between GAIL and BPCL was signed on 26 July 2004, and \nCUGL was incorporated on 25 February 2005 under the Companies Act 1956 with the objective \nof supplying natural gas initially in the city of Kanpur. As per the terms of the joint venture, the \npromoters shall have an equity participation of 22.5% each, and 5.0% of the equity has been \nreserved for the UP state government. The balance of 50.0% equity will be initially raised from \nfinancial  institutions  or  strategic  partners.  Shareholding  by  majority-owned  public  sector \nundertakings will be limited to no more than 50.0%. While no decision has been made, an initial \npublic listing of shares is contemplated around the fifth year of operations, which could involve a \ncombination of listing existing shares, a rights issue and/or issuing fresh shares. \n \n21.  Various synergies link the two promoters. While BPCL contributes its marketing and \nretailing expertise, GAIL has enormous experience in gas transportation and distribution. GAIL \nand BPCL have earlier implemented successful city gas distribution in Delhi and Mumbai. Both \nGAIL and BPCL are majority owned by the Government but were conferred navaratna status in \nJuly 1997. This designation provides the companies with strategic and operational autonomy, \nincluding the freedom to engage in investment, capital expenditures, and raising funds at home \nand abroad without Government approval or interference. They do not benefit from Government \nbudgetary support or sovereign guarantees. They operate under the Companies Act 1956 like \nother private sector companies in the energy sector.   \n \n22.  GAIL is India\u2019s principal gas transmission and distribution company, and 57% of its \noutstanding shares are owned by the Government. It was established in 1984 to create gas \nsector infrastructure for the sustained development of a gas market in India. It owns and \noperates 4,600 kilometers of gas transmission pipelines, including the world\u2019s longest LPG ", "  7\npipeline, measuring 1,269 kilometers.  Apart from its core business of natural gas transportation, \nGAIL  carries  out  operations  in  gas  processing,  petrochemicals,  LPG  transmission,  and \ntelecommunications.  BPCL is a Government undertaking formed on 24 January 1976. The \nGovernment still retains 66% of its outstanding shares. Its current activities are refining, storing, \nmarketing,  and  distributing  petroleum  products.  In  addition,  BPCL  has  diversified  into \npetrochemicals,  using  certain  refining  streams  as  feedstock.  More  information  on  CUGL\u2019s \norganizational structure and its main sponsors is in Appendix 3.  \n \nC.  Key Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Supreme Court Directives and Government Order \n \n23.  A public interest litigation under Article 32 of the Constitution of India was filed in 1985 by \nM.C. Mehta, then chairman of the Environmental Protection Cell operating at Delhi, concerning air \npollution in the capital. From this case, the Supreme Court ordered the phasing out of non-CNG \nbuses from Delhi, and an order dated 2 April 2002 made mandatory across India the conversion \nof the transport sector to CNG to reduce air pollution. In another landmark case, known as the Taj \nTrapezium  case,  the  Supreme  Court  issued  various  orders  to  GAIL,  ONGC,  and  the  state \ngovernment of UP to ensure natural gas was provided to industries near the Taj Mahal or \nrelocating to UP to prevent further pollution in the vicinity of Agra. The Constitution provides that \ndecisions and orders of the Supreme Court are binding on Parliament, state courts, and tribunals \nthroughout India and enforceable in the same manner as any law made by legislators. \n \n24.  Based on the Supreme Court directives, an executive order was issued in June 2005 by \nthe director for natural gas of MoPNG that mandated GAIL and BPCL to jointly pursue such city \ngas distribution projects as a joint venture. As there is no current legislative and regulatory \nframework for gas distribution, there is no explicit licensing process by which the firms operate.  \n \n2.  Gas Purchase Agreement \n \n25.  The Gas Linkage Committee has instructed MoPNG to allocate 0.10 MMSCMD of APM \ngas for CNG use in the Project. Consequently, CUGL signed a gas purchase agreement with \nGAIL on 31 October 2005 for supplying natural gas at the city gate station in Kanpur for 10 \nyears, a period that can be extended by mutual agreement.  \n \n3.  Project Management and Engineering Consultants \n \n26.  J.P. Kenny Triune Engineering Private Limited (J.P. Kenny) has been appointed project \nmanagement consultant. J.P. Kenny is part of the Wood Group, an international energy services \ncompany based in the United Kingdom. It has $2 billion in annual sales, employs 13,000 people, \nand operates in 35 companies. J.P. Kenny carried out the detailed design study for IGL\u2019s \nimplementation of the city gas project in Delhi. Trachtebel Engineering and Construction Private \nLimited was the design engineering consultant for the city gas network and developed the \noperation and maintenance (O&M) plans for CUGL. Tractebel Engineering is a division of Suez-\nTractebel, which is one of Europe\u2019s major engineering companies.  \n \n4.  Operational Arrangements \n \n27.  Based on the O&M plan developed by Tractebel, CUGL will carry out its own O&M at its \nCNG stations and on its gas distribution pipeline. CNG station operations will be monitoring \nthrough a supervisory control and data acquisition system and central control room. A stock of ", "8         \nequipment spares and supplies has been included in the capital cost estimates. Staff with \nexperience in gas pipelines will be seconded from GAIL to manage the O&M program.   \n \nD.  Environmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n \n1.  Environment \n \n28.   As  this  Project  is  classified  environmental  category  B,  an  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) was undertaken primarily as part of an ADB technical assistance project12 \nand has been developed based on the findings of a consultant report completed in December \n2004. To supplement the IEE, a second site visit was undertaken in August 2005 to verify that \nthe IEE findings were still current. The project is designed to reduce air pollution and improve \nambient air quality by switching vehicles from gasoline and diesel to CNG and residential, \nindustrial,  and  commercial  users  from  kerosene  and  LPG  to  PNG.  Except  for  short-term \ndisturbances during construction of CNG stations and pipeline digging and backfill operations \nwithin  the  road  right-of-way,  no  direct  negative  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated. \nAdditionally,  the  Project  has  a  strong  positive  impact  that  more  than  offsets any  negative \nimpacts. Public consultations were held on 30 November 2005 with people living along the \npipeline  route,  and  information  in  local  language  was  distributed  about  construction.  The \nsummary IEE is attached as Appendix 4.   \n2.  Resettlement \n \n29.  The  Project  is  classified  involuntary  resettlement  category  B  because  of  possible \nimpacts affecting people from the construction of the CNG stations and gas pipelines. However, \nfurther investigation has verified that no land will need to be acquired for those components \nalready identified.  The land being acquired for the CNG mother station and three online stations \nis  all  unencumbered  government  land,  as  verified  by  the  project  team.  Resettlement  or \ncompensation for identified CNG components is not required, as there are no affected people. \nFor the gas pipeline component, no land will be acquired, as the pipeline will be laid under the \nshoulder of existing city roads. If there are any structures adjacent to the shoulder, CUGL will \neither reroute the pipeline or use underground boring techniques to mitigate impacts. The same \nconclusion has been substantiated by the detailed engineering survey of the pipeline corridor. \nFor future CUGL components, a resettlement framework has been prepared to address any \nimpacts  that  may  occur.  If  necessary,  short-term  resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  and \nsubmitted to ADB for approval before construction begins. For any future components that may \ninvolve involuntary resettlement, CUGL will prepare resettlement plans and submit them to ADB \nfor approval before awarding civil works contracts. No current or future components will have an \nimpact on indigenous peoples.  The resettlement framework is attached as Appendix 5. \n \n3.  Impact on Poverty Reduction \n \n30.  The proposed equity investment will contribute directly to two strategies for achieving the \nultimate  objective  of  reducing  poverty  in  India.  First,  the  Project  contributes  to  enhancing \neconomic growth by developing infrastructure. Providing natural gas to small-scale industries at \na lower cost than alternative fuels may have an immediate impact on job creation by increasing \nproduction  and/or  attracting  energy-intensive  industries  to  the  area.  Second,  the  Project \ncontributes to human and social development by reducing health risks caused by using inferior \nfuels and air pollution indoors and out. Low-income people are particularly exposed to transport \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to India for the Urban Clean Fuels Project. Manila (TA 4182-IND). ", "  9\npollution because they often live close to major roads. In addition, the poor have limited access \nto medical services they cannot afford, which makes their general health vulnerable. Lowered \nmortality and morbidity from respiratory diseases will not only improve people\u2019s well-being but \nalso bring such economic benefits as reduced healthcare expenditures and higher household \nproductivity, as fewer days are lost to such illnesses as tuberculosis, bronchitis, asthma, and \npossibly even cancer. \n \nE.  Economic Analysis \n \n31.  An economic analysis was conducted to measure the Project\u2019s economic benefits and \ncosts. All costs and benefits are expressed in domestic price numeraire at constant 2005 \nvalues. The main objective of this analysis is to identify the net benefits accruing to the economy \nfrom the use of CNG and PNG in Kanpur. The net benefits of the Project are the difference \nbetween its cost and the economic benefits it generates. CNG demand from the transport sector \nand PNG demand from domestic, commercial, and industrial users is assumed to be both \nincremental and non-incremental, as CNG replaces existing fuels. After identifying the Project\u2019s \ncosts and benefits, an economic valuation of these costs and benefits was carried out by \nconverting market and local costs and prices (especially for non-traded goods and services) to \neconomic costs and prices and adjusting market and local values to a common basis by using \nestimated conversion factors. Based on the assumptions explained in Appendix 6, the Project \nhas an economic IRR of 36.4% and a net present value of Rs2,211.7 million. When health \nbenefits are included, the economic IRR increases to 56.4% and the net present value to \nRs6,852.9 million. \n \nV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  ADB Equity Investment \n \n32.   The proposed ADB equity investment is up to a 20.0% share in CUGL, which is estimated \nto cost Rs120.0 million ($2.6 million). The ADB equity investment will be provided from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources in Indian rupees.  \n \n33.  The proposed equity investment will be documented in appropriate share subscription and \nshareholder\u2019s agreements, which will contain terms and conditions suitable for this transaction \nand protecting ADB\u2019s minority shareholder rights. ADB\u2019s equity subscription agreement will be \nsubject  to  conditions  precedent,  including  all  the  necessary  governmental,  creditor,  and \nshareholder approvals and consents, and any contractual and financial arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB. ADB will have the right to appoint an independent director. The subscription agreement \nwill include mandatory exit rights for ADB should CUGL fail to comply at any time with ADB\u2019s \nenvironment and social safeguard policies or if India ceases to be a member of ADB.  \n \nB.  Justification for ADB\u2019s Assistance \n \n34.  The Project merits ADB\u2019s support for the following reasons: \n \n(i)  The Project will have a direct impact on the ambient air quality in urban areas by \nreducing pollution from diesel and gasoline vehicles and by switching industrial \nand commercial establishments to piped natural gas. Improved air quality will \nreduce public health costs from treating illnesses causes or worsened by air \npollution. In addition to improving ambient air quality, vehicles running on clean ", "10        \nnatural gas will improve safety conditions on urban roads and reduce noise \npollution.13   \n \n(ii)  The Project is in line with ADB\u2019s private sector operational strategy to promote \nprivate sector participation in infrastructure development. Furthermore, ADB\u2019s \nCSPU  for  India  (2006\u20132008)  confirms  ADB\u2019s  support  for  private  sector \nparticipation in clean fuel projects and gas distribution. The Project supports \nseveral key priorities of ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy in the previous CSPU, \nnamely  (i)  expanding,  de-constricting,  and  optimizing  transmission  and \ndistribution systems; (ii) promoting private sector participation; and (iii) ensuring \nenvironmental and social sustainability in the sector. \n   \n(iii)  The Project is structured as a public\u2013private joint venture company, and public\u2013\nprivate  partnerships  are  strongly  encouraged  by  ADB's  energy  policy  as  an \nefficient means of improving infrastructure in developing member countries. In \n2003, ADB provided a PPTA grant to help the Government of India prepare such \nprojects  for  implementation.  India's  largest  gas  companies  and  the  UP \ngovernment  together  will  own  50%  of  CUGL,  with  ADB  and  local  financial \ninstitutions owning the remaining 50%, making it a private company under the \nIndian Company Act 1956. Through PSOD, ADB has successfully supported a \nsimilar public\u2013private partnership in the Petronet Dahej LNG Project.14 \n \n(iv)  By providing PPTA to examine the benefits and costs, and by being directly \ninvolved in structuring the Project since 2004, ADB has helped ensure that key \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguard  requirements  are  addressed  early  in  its \ndesign phase.   \n \nC.  Compliance with Investment Limitations \n \n35.  The proposed ADB investment of $2.6 million equivalent in CUGL will be the 19th project \nin India supported by PSOD. Once approved, it will represent less that 0.1% of PSOD\u2019s total \nexposure and increase its investment in the energy transmission and distribution sector from \n4.2% of total exposure to 4.4%.15 The proposed investment is within ADB\u2019s aggregate, country, \nindustry, group, and single project exposure limits for private sector projects. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n36.  A framework agreement relating to ADB\u2019s status, privileges, and immunities with respect \nto its equity investments and lending operations in the private sector are in effect between ADB \nand the Government of India. In line with the ADB Charter, the Government of India will be \nasked to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance to CUGL. No shares will be \nsubscribed until ADB receives such confirmation. \n \n \n                                                 \n13 Natural gas offers greater safety in combustion, because it has a higher flashpoint than gasoline, and quieter \noperation, with less vibration and odor than diesel fuel. \n14 ADB. 2003.

Supply and Demand  \n1.  Introduction \n1.  India has one of the world\u2019s largest and fastest growing economies and is the sixth \nlargest consumer of energy in the world. In the South Asia region, it is the largest economy and \nby far the largest energy consumer. In 2003, India\u2019s consumption of commercial energy was \nequivalent to about 350 million tons of oil. Due to the abundance of coal resources relative to \nother  energy  resources,  coal  continues  to  account  for  more  than  half  of  the  country\u2019s \ncommercial energy consumption. However, natural gas now occupies a quickly growing share \nof India\u2019s energy balance. \n \n2.  Indigenous Gas Supply \n2.  The first gas discoveries in India occurred in the state of Assam in the late 1880s, but \nthe first deliveries of indigenous gas supplies from this state did not take place until 1959. They \nwere followed in 1964 by gas supplies from the Cambay Basin in the state of Gujarat. In 1974, \nthe state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) made a major hydrocarbon \ndiscovery at Bombay High off the western coast of India. \n \n3.  In the second half of 2002, or about 30 years after the Bombay High discovery, the \nprivately  owned  Indian  group  Reliance,  in  association  with  the  Canadian  company  Niko \nResources, made a large gas find in the Krishna-Godavari Basin off the coast of eastern Indian \nstate of Andhra Pradesh. According to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG), the \nKrishna-Godavari discovery may hold gas reserves in excess of 840 million cubic meters (30 \ntrillion cubic feet), which has not yet been verified. In January 2004, ONGC made a second gas \ndiscovery in the Krishna-Godavari Basin, but it was less important than the major Reliance find. \nOther gas discoveries were made by the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation, Niko Resources, \nONGC, and Cairn Energy on the western coast of India, and by Oil India Limited (OIL) in the \nnortheastern state of Assam. \n \n4.  Discoveries  in  the  Krishna  Godavari  Basin  by  Reliance  and  other  companies  are \nexpected to contribute significantly to the country\u2019s future indigenous supply of gas. According \nto MoPNG, India\u2019s recoverable reserves of natural gas were estimated at about 920 billion cubic \nmeters (bcm), or about 33 trillion cubic feet, during the first quarter of 2004. In fiscal year (FY) \n2004, India\u2019s total gross production of natural gas reached 32 bcm, with two state-owned \ncompanies, ONGC and OIL, accounting for 80% (ONGC 74% and OIL 6%) of the country\u2019s total \ngas production. At present, about 70% of the country\u2019s gas production is concentrated in the \nwestern offshore region. Onshore, the current gas production centers are located in the states \nof Gujarat, Assam, and Andhra Pradesh. \n \n3.  Gas Infrastructure \n5.  From the mid 1970s, when the first gas discoveries were made, until the late 1980s, \nIndia suffered from an absence of gas infrastructure. During the initial years of hydrocarbon \nproduction, associated gas had to be flared. In 1984, the Government established the Gas \nAuthority of India Limited, now called GAIL (India) Limited (GAIL), to address the critical issue of \ngas infrastructure development. FY1988 saw the commissioning of the first large cross-country \ngas pipeline system, the Hazira\u2013Bijaipur\u2013Jagdishpur (HBJ), which was developed by GAIL. ", "Appendix 2        15 \n \n6.  With a present total length of 2,800 kilometers and a design capacity of 33.4 million \nmetric standard cubic meters per day (MMSCMD), the HBJ is India\u2019s main gas pipeline. The \nHBJ transmits gas from the western coast of India to the central and northern parts of the \ncountry and the capital, New Delhi, with extensions to the states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. \nGAIL  has  also  developed  smaller  gas  networks  in  Andhra  Pradesh,  Assam,  Gujarat, \nMaharashtra, Pondicherry, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Tripura. \n \n7.  In addition to the existing gas pipeline, two new liquefied natural gas (LNG) import \nterminals were commissioned in Gujarat in early 2004 and 2005. One is located at Dahej and \nthe other at Hazira, at the starting point of the HBJ In order to transport the regasified gas from \nthe Dahej terminal, GAIL completed in FY2004, a new 610 kilometer gas pipeline from Dahej to \nBijaipur.  \n \n4.  Gas Consumption \n8.  Natural gas in India accounts for less than 10% of total consumption of commercial \nenergy. When consumption of such non-commercial fuels as biomass and waste is included, \nthe share of natural gas in total energy consumption is even smaller. In 2002, it was estimated \nat 4% of India\u2019s total primary energy consumption. Gas consumption in 2004 was estimated at \n81 MMSCMD, or about 30 bcm per year, structured as follows: (i) power 40%, (ii) fertilizers \n28%, (iii) petrochemicals and liquefied petroleum gas extraction 11%, (iv) steel 5%, (v) other \nindustries 12%, and (vi) compressed natural gas (CNG)/city gas 4%. As these figures show, gas \ndemand in India is dominated by the power sector and fertilizer industry, which account for \nabout 70% of total consumption. Gas supplies for the transport sector (as CNG) and city gas \ndistribution for the domestic, commercial, and industrial use account for only 4% of the current \nconsumption of natural gas. In 2004, the consumption of natural gas supplies for CNG and \ndistribution by pipeline was 1.2 MMSCMD in Delhi and 0.9 MMSCMD in Mumbai. The transport \nsector accounts for over 90% of the gas consumed in Delhi and 60% of the gas consumed in \nMumbai. \n \n5.  Gas Allocation \n9.  Gas consumption in India remains strongly constrained by supply, as a significant gap \nexists between gas requirements and indigenous gas supplies plus LNG imports through the \nnew  terminals  at  Dahej  and  Hazira.  Because  of  this  constraint,  indigenous  gas  supplies \nproduced by ONGC and OIL on their own, known as administered pricing mechanism (APM) \ngas, are allocated to different users by MoPNG based on the assessment of the inter-ministerial \nGas Linkage Committee.1 The allocated gas is supplied by ONGC and OIL mostly to energy-\nintensive consumers in the power sector and fertilizer industry at below international prices. The \npresent official government allocation of gas totals about 120 MMSCMD (or about 44 bcm per \nannum),2 but there is only about 70 MMSCMD (or about 26 bcm per annum) available for these \nallocations.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The committee includes the Planning Commission, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Power, Ministry of Chemicals \nand Fertilizers, and Ministry of Steel. \n2  The present gas allocation for Indraprastha Gas Limited in Delhi is 2 MMSCMD. For Mumbai, Mahanagar Gas \nLimited\u2019s gas allocation is 1.5 MMSCMD. \n ", "16       Appendix 2 \nB.  Gas Pricing Issues \n1.  Historical Context \n10.  In the 1960s, the prices of the first supplies of natural gas were fixed by the producing \ncompanies. By the early 1970s, prices were fixed by ONGC on a negotiated basis with different \ncategories of gas users, and in 1974 gas producers adopted a pricing mechanism based on a \nthermal  equivalence  with  coal.  Beginning  4  years  later,  from  1978  until  1986,  the  pricing \napproach was changed and the concept of replacement cost of alternative or substitute fuels \nwas adopted. The Government later assumed direct control of gas prices through a system of \nuniform Government-administered prices. Under this system, producing companies reported \nincreasing production costs and requested an increase in gas prices. \n \n11.  In 1997, a gas pricing order was issued by the Government that introduced a phased \nlinkage of consumer gas prices to a basket of low-sulfur and high-sulfur fuel oils.3 This fuel oil \nprice linkage applies only to gas produced by the state-owned companies ONGC and OIL (i.e., \nAPM gas) on their own and not by joint ventures with local or foreign companies or through the \nnew exploration licensing policy process. From April 2002, when the petroleum industry was \nexpected to be fully deregulated, gas prices were planned to be set at 100% parity with a basket \nof fuel oils. However, the dismantling of the APM for petroleum products was not followed by \nderegulation of gas prices, and the 1997 gas pricing order remains in place. \n \n2.  Current Situation \n12.  Recently, the Government\u2019s Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs decided to raise \nthe consumer ceiling price from Rs2.85 per cubic meter (m3) to Rs3.20/m3. For Indraprastha \nGas Limited (IGL) customers in Delhi, the end user price for APM gas purchased for CNG and \npipeline gas distribution is derived by taking this base price and adding a (i) royalty of 10% of \nthe producer price, (ii) purchase tax, (iii) transportation charge, and (iv) local connection charge. \n \n13.  With regard to non-APM gas, and as part of the opening up of the country\u2019s upstream \nsector to encourage investment in producing oil and gas, the Government allows gas supplies \nproduced from the different new exploration licensing policy blocks by private or joint venture \ncompanies to be sold at market-determined prices. Certain private supplies are now sold to \nGAIL and other customers at prices well above APM gas prices. The price recently paid by \nGAIL  for  certain  supplies  is  $3.86  per  million  British  thermal  units  (MMBTU),  or  about \nRs6.60/m3. With the introduction of imported Qatari LNG in January 2004, there is now a third \nmechanism  of  gas  pricing  in  India  based  on  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  gas  sales \nagreement between Petronet LNG and Qatar\u2019s RasGas. The price of the regasified LNG at the \nexit of the Dahej LNG terminal is reported to be $3.86/MMBTU on a net calorific basis. At the \nend-user  point,  the  regasified  LNG  price  is  reported  to  be  above  $4.5/MMBTU,  or  above \nRs7.70/m3 on a net calorific value basis. This is nearly double the gas purchase price of \nRs4.20/m3 (before the recent 12% price increase mentioned above) for APM gas supplied to \nIGL for its CNG and pipeline gas distribution operations.  \n \nC.  Sector Reform and Policy Framework \n14.  The  natural  gas  industry  of  India  has  historically  been  highly  centralized  and \nGovernment controlled. However, in the past few years the Government has initiated a number \n                                                 \n3  To be set at 55% parity in 1998 and gradually increase to 85% parity by 2001. ", "Appendix 2        17 \nof reform and policy initiatives to make it a more competitive and market-oriented industry, \nincluding both the public sector oil and gas companies and private investors.  \n \n1.  Sundararajan Committee and Strategic Planning Group \n15.  The  Government  constituted  the  Sundararajan  Committee  in  1994  to  provide  a \nframework for developing a market-determined pricing mechanism. The following year, it set up \nthe Strategic Planning Group for restructuring the oil industry. The objective of the committee \nwas to advise the Government on developing an internationally competitive and financially \nsound hydrocarbon sector. It suggested that GAIL should be responsible for laying down the \nmain trunk transmission pipeline, while the private sector or joint venture companies should be \nallowed to lay down spur lines. The private sector and foreign companies should be given the \nfreedom to import LNG, construct associated pipelines, and market its products. A regulatory \nbody should be set up to establish rules governing setting up in the industry, operations, and \naccess  to  pipelines.  It  further  recommended  that  a  gas  regulatory  authority  should  be \nestablished. The main objectives of the body would be to establish, coordinate, and monitor the \ntechnical aspects of natural gas exploration, production, and transportation and ensure fair \ncompetition, price stability, fair returns on investment, and transparency. \n \n2.  Hydrocarbon Vision 2025 \n16.  In  2000,  the  Government  constituted  a  group  to  chart  a  course  for  the  country  to \nsignificantly develop its hydrocarbon potential. Under the chairmanship of the finance minister, \nthe group came out with the Hydrocarbon Vision 2025 Report, which laid down the roadmap for \ndeveloping this sector. The report recommended pursuing LNG imports to meet the supply \ndeficit. To achieve this objective, it suggested (i) encouraging domestic companies to participate \nin the LNG chain, (ii) rationalizing customs duty on LNG and LNG projects, and (iii) leveling the \nfield for all gas players. It also recommended creating a policy framework for cleaner fuels. The \nreport  sought  to  open  up  the  hydrocarbon  market  so  that  there  would  be  free  and  fair \ncompetition among public sector enterprises, private companies, and international players, and \nto  establish  a  long-term  fiscal  policy  to  attract  foreign  investment  in  the  sector.  Such  a \ncompetitive environment would also require a regulatory and legislative framework, including a \nrational  tariff  and  pricing  policy  to  ensure  consumers  affordable  prices  coinciding  with  the \ngradual phasing out of existing price subsidies. \n \n3.  Auto Fuel Policy (2002) \n17.  On  25  September  2001,  the  Government  constituted  a  committee  of  experts  to  (i) \nrecommend  an  automotive  fuel  policy  for  major  cities,  (ii)  devise  a  road  map  for  its \nimplementation, and (iii) recommend suitable auto fuels, automobile technologies, and fiscal \nand  institutional  measures.  The  underlining  principle  of  the  policy  is  to  achieve  the  twin \nobjectives  of  (i)  providing  assured  supplies  of  fuels  at  minimum  cost  and  (ii)  meeting \nenvironmental  concerns  by  making  available  liquid  fuels  of  specified  quality  as  the  main \nautomotive fuels throughout the country and as alternative automotive fuels in cities with high \nvehicular pollution. \n \n18.  As per the policy, the quality requirements on gasoline and diesel are to be made more \nstringent over the next few years. At present, vehicles across the country have to comply with \nBharat I (equivalent to Euro I) standards. In 11 cities identified as having critical air pollution \nproblems, vehicles have to comply with Bharat II (equivalent to Euro II) standards. Fuel quality \nalso has to meet these requirements. The various specifications for improving fuel quality to \n ", "18       Appendix 2 \nmeet these stringent standards include, for gasoline, improving the octane rating and reducing \nbenzene, sulfur, and olefin and, for diesel, improving the cetane rating and adding diesel hydro \ntreatment units. The document estimates refinery investments of around Rs1,800 billion by 2005 \nand additional Rs1,200 billion by 2010 to meet the emission standards. \n \n19.  Regarding alternative fuels like CNG and liquefied petroleum gas, motor vehicle rules \nhave been amended to allow their use in the transport sector. The policy suggests that using \nthese fuels should be encouraged in cities highly affected with vehicular pollution. This would \ngive vehicle owners a choice for combining fuel and vehicle technology to meet tighter emission \nstandards. \n \n4.  Petroleum Regulatory Board Bill (2002) \n20.  The Government introduced in Parliament in May 2002 the Petroleum Regulatory Board \nBill to establish an independent regulator for gas and petroleum products. The bill provides for \nestablishing a Petroleum Regulatory Board4 to oversee and regulate the refining, processing, \nstorage, transportation, distribution, marketing, and sale of hydrocarbon products, excluding the \nproduction of crude oil and natural gas. The basic objective of this bill is to provide a regulatory \nmechanism to facilitate uninterrupted supplies of petroleum, petroleum products, and natural \ngas in all parts of the country, including remote areas, at fair prices. It also aims to promote \ncompetition in the market and make the monopolistic infrastructure accessible to all entities as a \ncommon, nondiscriminatory carrier. The bill includes provisions setting service obligations for \nretail  outlets  and  marketing  service  obligations  for  companies.  The  upstream  oil  and  gas \nexploration and production business has been left out of the purview of the regulator, and these \naspects will continue to be under the director general of hydrocarbon. \n \n21.  The main functions outlined for the regulatory board are as follows: \n \n(i)  Protect the interest of consumers by fostering fair trade and competition among \nentities. \n \n(ii)  Authorize entities to market petroleum and petroleum products, establish and \noperate liquefied natural gas terminals, and build and operate common carriers5 \n(i.e., pipelines). \n \n(iii)  Regulate  pipeline  access  and  related  transportation  charges  and  other \nassociated levies. \n \n(iv)  Ensure adequate availability of petroleum and petroleum products and monitor \nactivities  of  such  retail  providers  (e.g.,  prices,  equitable  distribution,  service \nstandards, etc.). \n \n5.  Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board Bill \n22.  Based on recommendations from a parliamentary standing committee, a number of \namendments  were  suggested.  MoPNG  has  rejected  some  of  the  recommendations  and \nproposed that some others be clarified or incorporated in the rules and regulations to be framed \n                                                 \n4 The board will include a chairman and maximum of four members to be appointed by the Government from among \npeople of eminence in various fields. \n5 Pipelines will be deemed as common carriers, but the entity laying the pipeline will get right of first use and \nremaining capacity may be used as common carrier, subject to the discretion of the board (section 20 of the bill). ", "Appendix 2        19 \nsubsequently. The bill has been renamed the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board Bill. \nSome of amendments incorporated are as follows: \n \n(i)  Central authority over state gas distribution networks. The Government has \ndecided to bring state gas distribution networks under the central regulatory \nregime. Further, the definition of common carrier transmission pipelines has been \namended to include local gas distribution activities. \n \n(ii)  Separate regulation of natural gas. Separate from petroleum, the board will \nregulate the natural gas sector within the policy framework of the Government. It \nis further clarified that the board will issue authorization for natural gas pipelines \nin accordance with the overall policy guidelines of the Government. \n \n(iii)  Price  monitoring.  On  the  basic  principles  relating  to  cartelization  and \nprofiteering, the new bill says that these two issues will be covered in detail in the \nregulations to be framed by the board based on widely accepted practices. It has \nalso  been  clarified  that  the  board  shall  monitor  prices  and  maintain  an \ninformation bank on activities related to the petroleum sector. \n \n23.  Some potential issues remain. Careful perusal of the bill suggests the possibility of \nexcessive interference from the Government, and the board has been granted discretionary \npowers on a host of critical issues that may impair the functioning of the sector. Nonetheless, \nwith the recent change in the Government, the earlier bill has lapsed and will have to be \npresented again in Parliament. MoPNG is in the process of getting cabinet approval for the bill \nso that it can be tabled in Parliament in December 2005.  \n \n6.  Draft Policy for Development of National Gas Pipeline Networks \n24.  As a result of recent gas discoveries off both of India\u2019s coasts and onshore in Rajasthan, \nand  with  the  commencement  of  LNG  imports  at  the  Dahej  LNG  terminal  in  Gujarat,  the \nGovernment  identified  the  urgent  need  to  promote  investment  in  natural  gas  transmission \npipelines  and  to  provide  interconnectivity  between  regions,  consumers,  and  producers.  In \nSeptember  2003,  the Government  issued  its Draft  Policy  for  Development  of  Natural  Gas \nPipeline Networks to address issues related to developing and regulating the gas pipeline \nnetwork.  The  Government  has  proposed  interim  guidelines  until  the  Petroleum  Regulatory \nBoard Bill is passed by Parliament and notified for enforcement. The objective of the policy on \nnatural gas pipelines is to secure equitable distribution of natural gas by (i) increasing the gas \nsupply, (ii) broad-basing the transmission and distribution networks, (iii) promoting competition \namong entities, and (iv) securing consumer interest. This policy will provide guidelines for \ngranting rights-of-use permission for laying natural gas pipelines. The Government will also \nperform other regulatory functions related to this subject until the Petroleum and Natural Gas \nRegulatory Board is set up. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "20  Appendix 3 \nCOMPANY AND SPONSOR BACKGROUND \n \nA.

Introduction \n1.  This appendix summarizes the benefits, adverse effects, and recommended mitigation \nand monitoring measures related to constructing and operating the Urban Clean Fuels Project \n(the Project) in Kanpur, India, undertaken by Central Uttar Pradesh Gas Limited (CUGL). The \ninitial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken primarily as part of an ADB technical \nassistance project1 and has been further developed based on the findings of a consultant report \ncompleted in December 2004. To supplement the IEE, a second site visit was undertaken in \nAugust 2005 to verify that its findings were still current. The primary purpose of the IEE is to \nprovide a tool for incorporating environmental concerns into the Project. The process adopted \nfor assessing potential environmental impacts has been to focus on compliance with current and \nknown future Indian regulations, including international agreements to which the government of \nIndia is a signatory, and ADB guidelines. This report is the summary IEE. \nB.  Project Description \n2.  The Supreme Court of India directed the Government to effectively address ambient air \npollution in 16 of the country\u2019s most polluted cities. With the on-going development of India\u2019s \nnatural gas sector through imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and the future exploitation of \ngas discoveries off the country\u2019s east coast, natural gas is expected to play a key role in \nreducing India\u2019s air pollution problem. The Supreme Court on April 2002 and May 2003 ordered \nhe preparation of a scheme for improving air quality in cities other than Delhi that are equally or \nmore polluted. Kanpur emerged as one of four highly polluted cities requiring further studies to \nprepare an action plan for improving air quality. \n3.  The Project has two main components for constructing and operating (i) one mother \nstation and several online stations to provide compressed natural gas (CNG) for vehicles and (ii) \na piped natural gas distribution system to serve residential, industrial, and commercial users. \nSixteen CNG stations are expected to be installed and become operational within the 6 years of \nproject  implementation.  Projected  gas  demand  in  the  initial  stages  is  0.03  million  metric \nstandard cubic meters per day, gradually increasing to 0.40 in 15 years. Gas is currently being \ntransported from Gujarat by GAIL (India) Limited through the Hazira\u2013Bijaipur\u2013Jajdishpur (HBJ) \npipeline  to  Sachendi,  where  a  23  millimeter  (8  inch)  feeder  line  carries  gas  the  final  12 \nkilometers to the city gate station in Kanpur.  \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n1.  Land Use \n4.  Kanpur runs east to west along the south bank of the River Ganga, with growth to the \nsouth restricted by the River Pandu. Most of Kanpur\u2019s commercial areas are in the heart of the \ncity, with industrial areas expanding to the west. Kanpur is home to a number of well known \neducational institutions including the Indian Institute of Technology, which occupies a significant \narea of land. Very small forested areas exist in Kanpur city, but none to these will be directly \naffected by the Project.  \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to India for The Urban Clean Fuels Project. Manila (TA 4182-IND). ", "Appendix 4    25\n2.  Climate \n5.  Kanpur  has  a  sub-tropical  climate.  The  hottest  months  are  May  and  June,  when \ntemperatures reach 40\u201345 \u00b0C. During December and January, the temperature falls as low as \n6\u201310 \u00b0C. The relative humidity during summer is 35\u201370%, in winter 55\u201386%, and in the wet \nmonsoon 60\u201393%. Annual rainfall is nearly 833 millimeters per year, with the three months of \nJuly, August, and September accounting for 77% of the total. Gentle winds prevail between \nNovember and February. The average wind speed during this period is 5\u201310 kilometers (km) \nper hour coming from the north-northeast. In summer, light winds occur with speed range from 5 \nto 20 km per hour from the north-northwest. Occasional dust storms occur with high winds in \nsummer.  Winds  are  relatively  stronger  during  the  wet  monsoon,  coming  from  the  south-\nsouthwest at 10\u201330 km per hour.  \n3.  Air Quality \n6.  The Central Pollution Control Board reports six ambient air quality-monitoring stations at \nFazalgunj, Deputy ka Padav, C.S. Azad Agricultural University, the head post office, Lajpat \nNagar, and the Forest and Training Center at Kidwai Nagar. Ground concentration data from the \nair monitoring stations located at Kanpur indicate that sulphur dioxide (SO ) and nitrous oxide \n2\n(NO ) concentrations  are  well  within  the  national  acceptable  limits.  However,  respirable \nx  \nsuspended particulate matter (RSPM) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations \nhave exceeded the annual average standards for residential areas at Deputy ka Padav and \nKidwai Nagar. At these stations, the range of annual average values of SPM and RSPM is 396\u2013\n570 nanograms per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m\u00b3) and 168\u2013242 \u00b5g/m\u00b3, respectively. These values are 3\u2013\n5 times the maximum residential area standards.  \n7.  Particulate matter is the pollutant of primary concern for this Project. The average ratio \nof the annual RSPM to SPM values at Kanpur is 0.52, which is within the expected range for \nurban environments. A summary of recent studies like the Central Pollution Control Board\u2019s \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  for  Kanpur,  comprehensive  action  plan  for \nenvironmental improvement of Kanpur, and report of the expert committee on auto fuel policy \nare presented in detail in section 4 of the IEE. \n4.  Surface and Ground water \n8.  Kanpur is bounded by the River Ganga on the north and the River Pandu on the south, \nwhich are significantly polluted by municipal wastewater. The Ganga is also a source of drinking \nwater for the city. Unfortunately, nallahs upstream of the drinking water intake at Bhairoughghat \ncontaminate  the  river.  A  major  untreated  stream  from  Sisamau  meets  the  same  channel \ndownstream of Bhairounghat, making the stretch of the Ganga along the city highly polluted. \nGround water is generally fit for drinking, though in a few areas it is contaminated with toxic \nheavy metals and other pollutants, which is attributed to past indiscriminate ground dumping of \ntoxic industrial waste by chemical companies. This damage is almost irreversible. \n5.  Population and Demographics \n9.  Kanpur is the 10th most populated urban agglomeration in India, with a population of 2.7 \nmillion in 2001 in an area of 299 square km, for a population density of nearly 9,000 people per \nsquare km.  \n ", "26  Appendix 4 \n6.  Human Health, Educational, and Other Facilities \n10.  In 2002 there were 99 allopathic, 24 aurvedic, 19 homeopathic, and 4 other hospitals, \nclinics, and dispensaries. There were 52 primary health centers and 31 family, mother, and \nchildcare  centers.  Kanpur  is  known  for  its  solid  base  of  higher  educational  and  research \ninstitutes. Forested land accounts for 0.5% of the district, and the gross agricultural area is 193 \nhectares, of which nearly 133 hectares was irrigated area in 2001.  \n7.  Energy Use \n11.  Kanpur has nearly 500,000 domestic liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) connections and \n1,100 commercial connections. According to the EMP, average daily consumption of LPG is \nnearly 91 tons, of coal 70 tons, of kerosene 105 kiloliters, and of wood 30 tons. Approximately \n195 tons of gasoline and 385 tons of diesel are consumed by an estimated 60,000 vehicles in \nKanpur, 88% of which use diesel fuel. The Project will see a portion of this consumption \nswitching to CNG, as old vehicles are converted and new CNG vehicles are bought.  \n8.  Physical and Cultural Heritage \n12.  Notable tourist points within the city are Bithoor, Ganga Ghats, J.K. Temple, and a zoo \nmeeting international standards. Portions of ancient structure and monuments of the time of \nKing Yayati survive in Jajmau, and there is a museum in Phool Bagh.  \nD.  Anticipated Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n13.  The Project is designed to reduce air pollution and improve ambient air quality by \nswitching vehicles from gasoline and diesel to CNG and residential, industrial, and commercial \nusers from kerosene and LPG to piped natural gas. Except for short-term disturbances from \nconstruction,  no  negative  direct  impacts  are  anticipated  from  project  design,  location,  or \noperations. The Project has a net positive impact to offset any negative impacts. \n \n14.  The primary benefits of the Project will be improvements in air quality. It is predicted that \nthe annual average ambient SPM value in Kanpur will be reduced by 57 \u00b5g/m3 if CNG is \nsuccessfully introduced in the transport sector and that further reductions are possible if piped \nnatural gas finds wide use in the industrial sector. Benefits will accrue to general health and \nhuman  welfare,  including  reductions  in  morbidity  and  mortality,  respiratory  illnesses,  and \nhospital visits associated with these ailments. Other environmental benefits include \n \n(i)  air quality improvements from reduced SO , volatile organic compounds such as \n2\nbenzo(a)pyrene, and particles measuring 10 microns or less; \n(ii)  reduced  groundwater  contamination  from  underground  fuel  storage  tanks  at \nfilling stations; \n(iii)  reduced gasoline and diesel run-off from roads and filling stations; and \n(iv)  the opportunity to install oil separators and traps in new dual-fuel filling stations. \n \n15.  There  will  be  socioeconomic  benefits  from  the  Project,  including  (i)  construction \nemployment for manual and skilled labor and operational employment at CNG filling stations \nand other facilities; (ii) new skills training for workers during construction and operation; (iii) \nindirect benefits to industries and businesses from CNG vehicle sales, regular inspections of \nCNG cascade tanks, and vehicle testing. Benefits may also extend to manufacturing piping \nmaterial and associated equipment vendors and specialist paint producers. Improving air quality ", "Appendix 4    27\nwill bring benefits for buildings and other physical infrastructure. Given that heritage sites have \nbeen damaged by air pollution, protecting the built environment is vital to the future of the city. \nPotential  negative  impacts  and  mitigation  measures  are  summarized  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan \n16.  Monitoring the EMP is expected to occur prior to construction to establish a baseline, \nduring construction and commissioning, and into the operation phase of the Project, ensuring \nthat all project activities undertaken by CUGL or its contractors are environmentally sound and \ncomply with national environmental regulations.  CUGL will be responsible for monitoring the \nconstruction impacts. There are six existing ambient air quality stations around Kanpur which \nregularly monitor emissions.  These stations are run by the UP State Pollution Control Board in \naccordance with the national ambient air quality monitoring program as set out by the Central \nPollution Control Board.  Data on SO , NOx and SPM is regularly submitted to the Central \n2\nPollution Control Board and will form the baseline for this project.  This information should be \nperiodically submitted to ADB by CUGL. The EMP aims to cover all the direct and indirect \ninfluences identified in the project IEE and to prevent, control, or mitigate adverse impacts on \nthe environment. It is expected that this EMP will continue to be developed throughout detailed \ndesign and adjusted to include mitigating action as required by revised design criteria. An EMP \nis included as Supplementary Appendix B. \n17.  Environmental awareness training is an important part of an effective environmental \ncompliance program and is an integrated part of the EMP. A project-designated environmental \ntraining coordinator should be assigned to deliver information on site safety and environmental \nrules.  Topics  may  include  (i)  general  site  maintenance,  (ii)  waste  management  rules  and \nrequirements, (iii) environmental regulatory rules, (iv) handling hazardous waste, (v) erosion and \nsediment control, (vi) protecting sensitive areas, (vii) reporting unanticipated discoveries, (viii) \nmaterial and waste disposal, and (ix) preventing and responding to spills. Approximately Rs30 \nmillion has been allocated for the environmental and social costs of the project, including \ntraining. \nF.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n18.  Disclosure on the Projects can be traced back to the 2002 Supreme Court directive, \ninitiated by public interest litigation, to the Government to make pollution norms applicable to \nmotor  vehicles  and  further  public  orders  to  prepare  schemes  for  supplying  CNG  to  other \npolluted cities in India, including Kanpur. More specifically to Kanpur, public consultations have \nbeen undertaken with certain stakeholder groups. In mid 2005, a consultation was held by the \nKanpur City Regional Transportation Office with all public transportation groups (taxi owners, \ntaxi drivers, and bus companies) and individual vehicle owners to discuss the introduction of \nCNG. Feedback from these stakeholders was positive in that the experiences in Delhi and \nMumbai have been very publicly discussed, and drivers appreciate that CNG is economical. \nMost expressed willingness to convert to CNG.  \n \n19.  Public consultations were held along the pipeline route on 30 November 2005 with \npeople who live and work in the vicinity. Advertisements were placed in five local newspapers \non the same day. Information pamphlets in the local language were distributed to a total of \napproximately 300 persons at five meetings. While the meetings explained the details of trench \ndigging, laying pipelines, etc., questions from the local residents related more to using natural \ngas:  can  scooters  run  on  CNG?  can  natural  gas  be  supplied  to  small  commercial \n ", "28  Appendix 4 \nestablishments? and when will supply begin? Many people were interested in natural gas and \nindicated that current delivery of LPG is not timely.   \n \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n20.  As with any major gas infrastructure project, this Project possesses two distinct aspects \nregarding environmental issues: \n \n(i)  Construction phase. Temporary disturbance to the environment lasting up to a \nfew days along any section of the city route and no longer than 6 months at the \nCNG stations. The duration of construction of the identified components is not \nexpected to last longer than 2 years. \n \n(ii)  Operational phase. Ongoing impacts, typically negative impacts associated with \nfacility maintenance, are of a much more limited nature but extend throughout the \noperating life of the project. However, beneficial impacts including improvements \nin air quality and public health resulting from fuel switching are expected to be \nsignificant (refer to Kanpur IEE Appendix C for details). \n \n21.  The extent of any negative environmental impacts associated with the Project can be \nminimized by appropriate consideration during its design and planning for construction. An \nenvironmental management plan must be developed, updated, and executed by CUGL as the \nProject progresses from detailed design to implementation. Based on findings from the IEE \nsummarized  here,  no  full  environmental  impact  assessment  is  required  if  the  EMP  is \nimplemented as presented.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 5    29\nRESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The Urban Clean Fuel Project (the Project) for the city and region of Kanpur, is being \ndeveloped by Central Uttar Pradesh Gas Limited (CUGL), which is a joint venture company with \nequity participation initially from GAIL (India) Limited and Bharat Petroleum Company Limited \n(BPCL). Its main objective is to improve ambient air quality and public health in focal cities of \nIndia  by  providing  clean  piped  natural  gas  (PNG)  and  compressed  natural  gas  (CNG)  to \ntransport, industrial, commercial, and domestic users. \n \n2.  The proposed Project adopts an involuntary resettlement approach similar to a sector \nloan. The components identified for implementation in the first year of the Project do not involve \ninvoluntary resettlement.  This resettlement framework has been prepared to cover any future, \nas-yet-unidentified components that may involve involuntary resettlement impacts as defined \nunder ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement1. The resettlement framework outlines the \nobjectives, policy principles and procedures for acquisition of land (if any), compensation and \nother  assistance  measures  for  affected  persons,  and  procedures  for  the  preparation  of \nadditional components under the project.  CUGL will be the project sponsor and responsible for \npreparing resettlement plans for all project components which involve involuntary resettlement \n(if any) in accordance with this framework. and will submit them to ADB for review and approval \nprior to the award of civil works contracts for each component. \n \nB.  Resettlement Policy and Framework \n3.  In India, public land acquisition and related compensation is governed by the Land \nAcquisition Act 1894, as amended in 1984. In accordance with the act, the legal process for \nland acquisition is initiated by project sponsors applying to the competent district authority. \nAdditional to the Land Acquisition Act is the National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation \n(NPRR), which was approved by the Government of India in February 2004. Neither adequately \nprovides mitigation to many project-related impacts.   \n \n4.  In view of the above, following the national laws and regulations on land acquisition and \nincorporating ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement as well as the national policy, the basic \nprinciples  for  the  Project  include  the  following  elements  with  respect  to  each  subproject, \nincluding core subprojects: \n \n(i)  Land acquisition and other involuntary resettlement impacts will be avoided, or \nwhere this is not feasible, minimized as much as possible. \n(ii)  Any land acquisition and/or resettlement should result in improvement or at least \nrestoration of the affected people\u2019s pre-project income and living standards. \n(iii)  Affected people will be consulted on compensation options, and the preparation \nof the resettlement plan will be carried out in accordance with this framework. \n(iv)  Payment of compensation for acquired assets will be at full replacement costs2. \n(v)  Payment  of  compensation  for  lost  land,  housing,  assets,  and  resettlement \nallowances will be made in full prior to the contractor taking physical possession \nof the land and commencement of construction. \n                                                 \n1 ADB.  1995. Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. \n2 Replacement costs is defined as the method of valuing assets to replace the loss at market value, or its nearest \nequivalent, plus any transaction costs such as administrative charges, taxes, registration and titling costs. \n ", "30  Appendix 5 \n(vi)  Resettlement assistance will be provided to affected people, including non-titled \npeople (e.g., informal dwellers, squatters, and encroachers), prior to acquiring \nthe land and commencing construction. \n(vii)  Provision will be made for income restoration and rehabilitation. \n(viii)  Special attention will be paid to vulnerable groups. \n \n5.  In cases where ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement requirements are more extensive than \nthose provided under national or state law, ADB\u2019s requirements, as laid out in this resettlement \nframework, will be followed. \n6.  The Land Acquisition Act defines the role of the competent authority, which is the district \ncollector or Land Acquisition and Resettlement Department officer under the district collector\u2019s \noffice who has the authority to issue notice for land acquisition and award compensation to \naffected people. For this Project, land can be acquired by the competent authority for CUGL, in \nwhich case compensation is awarded by CUGL through the competent authority. CUGL also \nneeds  to  provide  additional  assistances  to  project-affected  communities  in  line  with  ADB \nresettlement policy and principles. A second way of procuring land is by direct purchase from \nthe private owner by CUGL at replacement value.  \n7.  The initial survey will be done by CUGL, and the land requirements will be submitted \nthrough a formal application process to the competent authority. The competent authority, \nfollowing the relevant sections of the Land Acquisition Act, will issue notifications for land \nacquisition and verify title to the land before awarding compensation.  \n8.  Regarding  eligibility  for  compensation,  all  affected  people  will  be  provided  with \ncompensation and rehabilitation if (i) their land is reduced, (ii) income sources are adversely \naffected, (iii) their house is partly or fully demolished, or (iv) other property such as crops, trees \nor other facilities are lost or damaged . Lack of legal documentation defining customary rights of \noccupancy or absence of formal legal title shall not affect people\u2019s eligibility for compensation. \nAny such losses resulting from changes in project design during construction shall also be \ncompensated in keeping with this resettlement framework. \n \n9.  When land-for-land is not a feasible option, the resettlement framework stipulates paying \ncompensation at the assessed value of the land and structure to the affected people. In addition \nto compensation payments made by the competent authority, affected people will receive \n \n(i)  additional  assistance  to  match  replacement  costs,  which  is  the  difference \nbetween the market value and the assessed value, if any, for lost land and \nhouses,  \n(ii)  transaction  costs  such  as  stamps  and  registration  costs,  in  the  case  of \nreplacement land purchase, and  \n(iii)  other cash grants and resettlement assistance such as shifting allowance and \ncompensation for lost workdays or income caused by dislocation.  \n \nIn addition to the above, female-headed households and other vulnerable households, such as \nthose with scheduled tribes or castes, disabled, or elderly, will be eligible for further cash \nassistance for relocation and house reconstruction. \n \n10.  Income restoration assistance by CUGL shall be made available to all those losing their \nmain source of livelihood as a result of the Project. The income restoration strategy will focus on ", "Appendix 5    31\neconomic activities that provide a sustained source of income to restore or improve the affected \npeople\u2019s standard of living. A detailed inventory of losses will be made. In addition, a detailed \nassessment of affected people\u2019s existing skills will be made to guide skills development and \ntraining.  Assistance  will  be  provided  for  income-generating  vocational  training  and  skills \nupgrading, including starting suitable production or service activities in the project area. Affected \nsquatters  shall  be  reorganized  and  relocated  depending  on  the  severity  of  the  impact. \nEnterprise development shall be especially promoted among affected people to contribute to \nsustainable income restoration. \n \n11.  The  entitlement  matrix  (Supplementary  Appendix  A)  lists  various  types  of  losses, \nidentification and eligibility requirements, and entitlements, and provides basic parameters for \npreparing  compensation  and  resettlement  benefits.  The  matrix  applies  to  identified  and \nadditional project components.  \n \nC.  Procedures for Resettlement Plan Preparation \n12.  Each additional project component will be prepared, and the additional detailed design of \neach component will be undertaken, by the CUGL in keeping with the following: \n \n(i)  Social  impact  assessment  surveys,  including  a  census  survey  and  an \nsocioeconomic survey of 20% of affected people, will be carried out for each of \nthe components based on preliminary technical designs. \n(ii)  If impacts of a component are found to be significant,3 a full resettlement plan will \nbe prepared for approval prior to awarding contracts for that component. \n(iii)  If impacts are less than significant, a short resettlement plan will be prepared for \nthat component for approval prior to awarding contracts. \n(iv)  The resettlement plan will include measures to ensure that the socioeconomic \nconditions, needs, and priorities of women are identified, and that the process of \nland acquisition and resettlement does not disadvantage women. \n \n13.  The  project  implementation  team  conducting  preparatory  studies  for  all  project \ncomponents involving land acquisition or involuntary resettlement should include a resettlement \nspecialist  familiar  with  ADB  policy  and  procedures  for  preparing  additional  component \nresettlement  plans.  The  resettlement  plans  must  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement and other social safeguard guidelines. When impacts on indigenous people are \nidentified, an indigenous people\u2019s development plan must be prepared in keeping with ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Indigenous People. CUGL will submit the resettlement plans to ADB for approval, prior \nto award of contracts for civil works.  \n \nD.  Institutional Responsibilities \n14.  The  resettlement  plan  will  include  adequate  institutional  arrangements  to  ensure \neffective  and  timely  design,  planning,  consultation,  and  implementation  of  compensation, \nresettlement,  and  rehabilitation.  CUGL  will  bear  primary  responsibility  for  preparing  and \n                                                 \n3  Involuntary resettlement category A: significant means 200 or more people will experience major impacts, which \nare defined as (i) being physically displaced from housing or (ii) losing 10% or more of their productive assets. \nCategory A projects require a full resettlement plan. Some of these projects may require a resettlement framework \nprior  to  the  full  resettlement  plan.  Involuntary  resettlement  category  B:  not  significant  includes  involuntary \nresettlement impacts that are not deemed significant and require a short resettlement plan.  Some of these projects \nmay require a resettlement framework prior to the short resettlement plan.

CUGL would ensure that resettlement plans are prepared and \napproved prior to awarding contracts for each component and for monitoring any changes \ndesign that may require re-evaluation of the need for and adequacy of the resettlement plan. \nCUGL  will  create  a  cadre  of  in-house  resettlement  officers  with  experience  implementing \nresettlement and rehabilitation to supervise and monitoring implementation. In addition, CUGL \nwill  hire  experienced  nongovernment  organizations  and  agencies  to  help  prepare  and \nimplement resettlement plans. The resettlement officers and NGO and agency staff will undergo \norientation and training in resettlement management. Training will focus on (i) the principles and \nprocedures of land acquisition, (ii) public consultation and participation, (iii) entitlements and \ncompensation  disbursement  mechanisms,  (iv)  redressing  grievances,  and  (v)  monitoring \nresettlement.  An  independent  monitoring  agency  and/or  expert  will  be  hired  by  CUGL  in \nagreement with ADB to undertake external monitoring for the entire Project. CUGL will further \nensure  resettlement  budgets  are  delivered  on  time  to  the  competent  authority  and  the \nimplementing NGOs for timely resettlement plan implementation. \n \nE.  Disclosure, Consultation, and Grievances \n15.  Consultation  and  public  disclosure  will  continue  to  be  integral  to  the  Project.  Each \nresettlement plan will be prepared and implemented in close consultation with the stakeholders \nand  will  involve  focus  group  discussions  and  meetings,  particularly  with  the  affected \nhouseholds. The resettlement framework will also be made available in the local language(s) \nduring the public meetings. Copies of draft resettlement plans will be made available at local \npublic offices prior to awarding civil works contracts. A summary of the resettlement plan will be \ndisclosed on the ADB website, and consultation will continue throughout project implementation. \n \n16.  Complaint and grievance procedures will be outlined in each resettlement plan. The \ngrievance redressal committee will redress all grievances locally in a consultative manner and \nwith the full participation of affected households or their representatives, project officials, and \nlocal  government  representatives.  The  committee  shall  include  members  of  the  revenue \ndepartment and representatives of affected people including women and vulnerable groups.  \nGrievances will be redressed within 2\u20134 weeks from the date they were made. All costs incurred \nin resolving the complaints will be borne by the Project.  \n \nF.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n17.  For components with resettlement plans or short resettlement plans, CUGL will conduct \nregular  internal  monitoring  of  resettlement  implementation  and  prepare  quarterly  progress \nreports to be made available to an independent monitoring expert. The reports will describe \nprogress made in resettlement plan implementation with particular attention to compliance with \nits principles and matrix. The report will document consultation activities and provide a summary \nof  issues  or  problems  identified  and  actions taken  to  resolve  the  issues.  It  will  provide  a \nsummary of grievances or complaints lodged by households and actions taken to redress such \ncomplaints. An independent agency or monitoring expert will be engaged and carry out biannual \nmonitoring during project implementation. The biannual monitoring report will be submitted \ndirectly to ADB.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " Appendix 6        33 \nECONOMIC EVALUATION \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The economic evaluation of Urban Clean Fuels Project (the Project) is based on Asian \nDevelopment  Bank\u2019s  guidelines  economic  analysis  of  projects.  The  main  objective  of  this \nanalysis is to identify the net benefits accruing to the economy from the use of compressed \nnatural gas (CNG) and piped natural gas (PNG) in the transport and non-transport sectors in \nKanpur. The net benefits of the project are estimated based on the economic benefits generated \nby the Project less its economic costs. It is assumed that CNG demand from the transport \nsector and PNG demand from the domestic, commercial, and industrial sectors are both non-\nincremental and incremental (i.e., CNG and PNG replace existing fuels used in those sectors \nand new customers and vehicles consuming fuel). The Project\u2019s benefits and costs will depend \non the retained assumptions for switchover from existing fuels to CNG and PNG. \n \n2.  Following the identification of the Project\u2019s costs and benefits, an economic valuation of \nthem is carried out by converting market and local costs and prices (especially for non-traded \ngoods and services) into economic costs and prices and adjusting market and local values to a \ncommon basis with the use of estimated conversion factors. The shadow exchange rate factor  \nis estimated at 1.16. The shadow wage rate factor is estimated at 0.60.1 \n \nB.  Identification of Economic Rationale \n3.  The economic rationale of the Project is based on the overall net economic (as opposed \nto financial) benefits to the local and national economies from the introduction of natural gas in \nthe transport and non-transport sectors. The net savings from natural gas are estimated for \neach of the sectors as shown in Table A8.1. The fuel cost savings for the transport sector are \nbased on the difference between gasoline and CNG prices. For industries, fuel cost savings are \nbased on the price difference between diesel and PNG prices, while for the domestic and \ncommercial sectors the savings are based on the differences between liquefied petroleum gas \n(LPG) and PNG prices. \n \nTable A8.1:  Costs and Fuel Savings \n \nItem  Transport Industrial  Domestic\nAverage fuel savings, Rs/m3  1.41 1.32  1.54\nm3 = cubic meter, Rs = rupees. \nSource:  Consultant estimates  \n \nC.  Identification of Project Benefits and their Valuation \n4.  The without-project and with-project benefits have been categorized into project output \nfrom incremental sales to new vehicles and new connections, fuel savings benefits, and health \nbenefits. Project output and fuel savings are the direct benefits of the Project, while the other \nbenefits are considered supplemental benefits, for which quantification is less certain. \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2004. Shadow Exchange Rates for Project Economic Analysis:  Toward Improving Practice at the Asian \nDevelopment Bank. ERD Technical Note Series 11. Manila. \n ", "34  Appendix 6 \n1.  Project Output \n5.  The direct output of the Project is the use of CNG and PNG replacing gasoline and \ndiesel  in  the  transport  sector  and  mainly  diesel  and  LPG  in  non-transport  sectors.  This \nsubstitution will have an impact on India\u2019s balance of payments, as the country imports some of \nthe petroleum products it consumes, namely LPG, and exports excess diesel and gasoline. This \nimpact can be measured but is not incorporated into this project analysis. If natural gas supplies \nare priced competitively, the direct benefit of using CNG and PNG is the price difference \nbetween them and the fuels they replace. \n \n2.  Health Benefit \n7.  The health benefits of the Project were estimated based on assumptions of health costs \nwith and without it. The heath impacts were estimated based on the population expected to \nbenefit  from  pollution  reductions  resulting  from  the  Project.  The  criterion  pollutant  was \nparticulate matter of aerodynamic diameter measuring less than 10 microns (PM ), as this \n10\nrelatively easily passes into the human respiratory tract. The long-term net change of PM  was \n10\nestimated and valued to show the health benefit from the Project. The net change of PM  \n10\ndepends on CNG switchover rates in the transport sector. The Project is forecast to have \npositive health impacts, particularly for the low-income people who are exposed to high pollution \nby living near major roads. \n \n3.  Fuel Cost Savings \n8.  Switching from conventional fuels to natural gas will create fuel cost savings as gas \nprices are set competitively compared to those of gasoline, diesel, and LPG. These savings are \nbased on the estimated natural gas penetration of transport and non-transport sectors, the rate \nof conversion from alternative fuels, and the growth rates for both new vehicles and overall \ngrowth in population, applying the percentage of households using LPG, which is the target \nmarket  (14.2%).  Vehicle  and  household  conversions  rates  were  based  on  a  detailed \nindependent market survey carried out in 2005, and the company has incorporated conservative \nestimates in its business plans. \n \n4.  Other Benefits \n9.  Other indirect project benefits that cannot be quantified are (i) industries and businesses \ncapitalizing on reliable gas supplies to improve their production efficiency and possibly expand \noperations and employment; (ii) household time savings from a constant gas connection that \ncan improve the efficiency of women\u2019s housework and the household economy; (iii) reductions \nin pollution and acid damage to buildings and heritage sites; and (iv) potential increases in \namenity values to land and property and more tourism resulting from reduced pollution. \n \nD.  Identification of Costs and their Valuation \n10.  Economic costs as a result of the Project are assumed to be incremental. This section \nestimates  in  economic  terms  the  incremental  capital  and  operating  expenditures  for  gas \npipelines and CNG stations and the conversion costs for vehicles and non-transport sector \napplications.  In  addition,  air  quality  and  emissions-testing  equipment  are  included  in  the \neconomic analysis. \n ", " Appendix 6        35 \n1.  Pipeline and CNG Stations \n11.  Using modern gas-distribution technology, detailed engineering was carried out by an \nindependent  firm  to  design  an  optimal  gas  distribution  network  for  Kanpur  to  serve  PNG \ncustomers  and  phase  in  CNG  stations  to  meet  demand  in  a  least-cost  manner.  It  was \ndetermined  to  construct  online  stations  with  600  standard-cubic-meter-per-hour  gas-driven \ncompressors  instead  of  daughter  booster  stations.  The  mother  station  shall  have  a  1,200 \nstandard-cubic-meter-per-hour gas-driven compressor. Distribution pipes have been designed \nand sized according to the required pressure for estimated distribution lengths either directly \nfrom the steel network or through medium density polyethylene pipe. The system has been \noptimized based on demand projections.  \n \n12.  Pipeline  costs  consist  of  estimated  capital  and  operating  expenditures.  The  major \nequipment at the mother and 15 online stations are gas compressors, cascades, dispensers, \nand metering skids. All capital expenditures for the Project are local costs sourced in India, but \nthey are categorized into tradable and non-tradable items. Tradable items are equipment and \nmaterials, while non-tradable items are civil works, project management, detailed engineering, \nprocurement and construction supervision, owner\u2019s management expenses, and contingencies. \nTradable items will be adjusted with the shadow exchange rate factor to derive the economic \nvalues of the Project\u2019s capital and operating expenditures or costs. Non-tradable items, mostly \nlabor costs, will be further identified as skilled and unskilled laborers. Unskilled labor is around \n70% of total manpower but its cost per person is relatively low. Total unskilled labor cost is \nestimated at around 6% of total manpower cost. \n \n2.  Vehicle Conversion Costs \n13.  Vehicle conversion costs cover (i) the conversion cost of vehicles from diesel or gasoline \nto CNG and (ii) the cost of new CNG vehicles compared to diesel and gasoline vehicles. \nEstimated vehicle conversion costs were based on data collected from vehicle suppliers and \ndealers and the estimated actual costs experienced in New Delhi. As diesel vehicles are difficult \nto convert to CNG, these have higher conversion costs. \n \n14.  The conversion costs of light motor vehicles such as taxi and private cars running on \ndiesel and three-wheelers running on gasoline were collected from Mahanagar Gas Limited \n(MGL) in Mumbai. The corresponding costs of original equipment manufacturer (OEM) CNG \nvehicles for the above categories were estimated based on information from Tata Motors and \nBaja Auto. The conversion cost of light commercial vehicles and buses was not considered as \nthe Project assumed no conversion of existing diesel vehicles. The OEM costs for new CNG \nbuses  were  collected  from  the  Delhi  Transport  Corporation  and  for new  CNG-fuelled  light \ncommercial  vehicles  from  private  industry.  In  estimating  the  economic  cost  of  converting \nvehicles to CNG and the incremental cost of new CNG vehicles, it was found that tradable items \ncomprise 90 percent of the cost, and non-tradable item 10 percent.  \n \n15.  Estimates of conversion costs to PNG in the domestic sector were based on discussions \nwith PNG suppliers such as IGL and MGL. This cost was then converted by the shadow \nexchange rate to give the economic cost, which is used in the economic analysis. \n \n3.  Operating Costs  \n16.  The estimate of the operating costs of the natural gas pipeline; city gate distribution line \nfor the domestic, commercial, and industrial users; and CNG stations are presented in the \n ", "36  Appendix 6 \nfollowing subsections. Operating costs include power and fuel costs to run the CNG stations \nand manpower, repair, maintenance, and insurance costs. Fixed costs have been assumed for \npower  supply  and  fuel  costs  for  the  compressors.  Repairs  and  maintenance  have  been \nestimated at 5% and insurance costs at 1% of sales.  \n \nE.  Project Economic Analysis \n17.  The economic model is structured similarly to the financial model, but all inputs have \nbeen adjusted to economic prices. In addition, the economic model does not include financing \ncosts and is independent of the debt and equity structure of the Project. Table A8.3 shows the \neconomic net present value calculated on a 12% discount rate for the Project, together with the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR), both with and without the health and social benefits. \nBased on the assumptions explained above, the Project has an EIRR of 36.4% and a net \npresent value of Rs2,211.7 million. When health benefits are included, the EIRR increases to \n56.4% and the net present value to Rs6,852.9 million.
