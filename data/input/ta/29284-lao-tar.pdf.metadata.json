INTRODUCTION\n1. During the Bank's Country Programming Mission in January 1995, the Government\nof the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) requested inclusion in the Bank's Country\nProgram, of advisory technical assistance (TA) for the Corporate and Financial Development of\nElectricit\u00e9 du Lao. In October 1995, a Bank Fact-finding Mission visited Lao PDR and reached\nan understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost, and implementation\narrangements of the TA.1 The TA has been included in the Bank's 1996 Country Program.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The Bank's activities in the energy sector in Lao PDR have concentrated on the\npower subsector. The Bank has played a leading role by providing 11 loans to the subsector;\nacting as coordinator of funds for the second phase of the 1 50-megawatt (MW) Nam Ngum\nHydropower Project; and extending TA for project preparation, improvements in operating\nefficiency, and strengthening the accounting capabilities of Electricit\u00e9 du Lao (EdL). The Bank's\nstrategy in the energy sector supports the Government's objectives, particularly in the\ndevelopment of hydropower resources for export and the expansion of the power system, as\nhydropower exports are a major foreign exchange earner for the country. Policy dialogue with\nthe Government has focused on cost recovery, improvements in financial and operational\nefficiency of the power utility, and the development of procedures to identify and evaluate\npotential power projects for private sector participation, as well as development of the legal\nframework to facilitate such participation.\n3. Power generation, transmission, and distribution are the responsibility of EdL,\nwhich is a wholly State-owned public enterprise. EdL's area of responsibility was in the past\nlimited to Vientiane Province, but in mid-1991, the service area was expanded as EdL took over\nthe assets of the provincial electricity authorities in Luang Prabang, Khammouane, Savannakhet,\nSaravane, and Champassak provinces. In other provinces, local authorities assisted by EdL are\nresponsible for minor electricity networks, but plans are under way to gradually extend EdL's\nresponsibility to the entire country as the grid expands.\n4. Access to electricity in Lao PDR is limited, with only about 17 percent of the\npopulation currently connected to the relatively small, separated grids. The largest grid serves\nVientiane City, the surrounding rural area, and the towns of Vangvieng and Luang Prabang. The\nVientiane grid is supplied from the Nam Ngum hydropower station (150 MW). The southern Xeset\ngrid covers parts of Saravane and Champassak provinces and is supplied from the Xeset\n(45 MW) and Selabam (2 MW) hydropower stations. Both of these grids are interconnected to\nthe Tahir grid for export of electric power generated in excess of domestic demand. Outside\nthese areas, electricity service consists of (i) two small networks serving the capitals of the\ncentral provinces of Khammouane and Savannakhet (Thakhek and Savannakhet, respectively)\nand surrounding areas that are supplied from the Thai grid through cables under the Mekong\nRiver; and (ii) scattered, small generating sets (hydro and diesel) serving small communities.\n5. Over the past ten years, 70-80 percent of the total electricity generated has been\nexported to Thailand. At about 43 kilowatt-hours (kWh) in 1994, the domestic per capita\nThe TA was first isted in ADB Business Opportunities in January 1996.", "electricity consumption in Lao PDR is among the lowest in Asia.2 Vientiane and the surrounding\narea have the best developed distribution network and account for more than 80 percent of\ndomestic consumption. Energy sales in the Vientiane grid have increased at an average of\n9.9 percent per annum over the last four years, from 87 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 1991 to an\nestimated 127 GWh in 1995, because of increased economic activity, particularly in cottage and\nsmall-scale industries. Following commissioning of the Xeset hydropower station in mid-i 991,\ndomestic sales in the Xeset grid grew rapidly to supply the previously suppressed demand, and\nto meet the increased industrial and commercial loads in the expanding distribution network.\nSales in the Xeset grid for 1995 are expected to reach 23 GWh, which is more than three times\nthe 1990 sales (7 GWh). The demand in these two grids, as well as in the central provinces\nsupplied by imports from Thailand, is expected to continue growing rapidly.\n6. The most significant past investment in the energy sector was the 150-MW\nNam Ngum hydropower station (Phase 1-30 MW; Phase 11-80 MW; and Phase 111-40 MW).\nPhases I and II were financed mainly on a bilateral basis, while Phase Ill was assisted by the\nWorld Bank. In addition, the World Bank financed (i) the power transmission component for the\nXeset hydropower station; (ii) power distribution facilities in the southern provinces of\nSavannakhet, Champassak, and Saravane; and (iii) the investigation work for small-scale\nhydropower development in these provinces. The most recent assistance provided by the World\nBank is the expansion of the transmission and distribution networks in the central and southern\nprovinces, including the institutional development of EdL and a feasibility study for further\nexpansion of Nam Ngum.\n7. The Bank's 11 loans to the power subsector to date have included\n3 supplementary loans to finance cost overruns, for a total of 7 projects. Four projects financed\nby seven loans are complete: two (the Nam Ngum-Luang Prabang Power Transmission Project,\nfor which a supplementary loan was approved by the Bank in August 1994, and the Nam Song\nHydropower Development Project) are at an advanced stage of implementation, while\nimplementation of the 210-MW Theun-Hinboun Hydropower Project, approved in November\n1994, has just commenced. The completed power projects have been postevaluated. The first,\nthe Vientiane Power Distribution Project, was rated partly successful, as it experienced a cost\noverrun following civil unrest in the country in the mid-1970s, resulting in the need for a\nsupplementary loan. The next two projects, Vientiane Plain Rural Electrification, Phases I and II,\nwhile relatively problem free and, therefore, rated generally successful, highlighted the need to\naddress the issues of low domestic tariffs, and high accounts receivable and system losses in\nthe Vientiane Plain grid. The Xeset Hydropower Project was also rated generally successful; it\nwas implemented within the original schedule but incurred a cost overrun because of factors\nbeyond the control of Project management. The Project Performance Audit Report identified the\ncontinuing need to address the issues of domestic tariffs and system losses, and to implement\nthe EdL reorganization plan that had been prepared under a World Bank credit3 and approved\nby the Government. Policy dialogue with the Government has addressed the issues raised in the\npostevaluation exercise, indicating that cognizance has been taken of the previous experience\ngained in lending to the power subsector.\nThis compares with 26 kWh in Cambodia, 28 kWh in Nepal, 42 kWh in Bangladesh, 130 kWh in Viet Nam,\nand 739 kWh in Thailand.\nIDA Credit No. 2425: Provincial Grid Integration Project, approved on 23 December 1992.", "3\n8. Discussions with the Government and EdL have covered two main areas: private\nsector participation in the power subsector and EdL's institutional capability and financial\nperformance. Given the Government's limited capital resources and its ambitious investment\nprogram, the dialogue has focused on the institutional and financial aspects of EdL to ensure\nthe efficient development of the power subsector. The success of the policy dialogue is indicated\nby the significant improvement of EdL's institutional strength and the major tariff increases during\nthe past years, as well as by the recognition by the Government of the need to corporatize EdL.\nThe latter has become a priority under the recently enacted Public Enterprise Law, and a\nrestructuring of Ed L's organizational and management structure is already under way. The new\ncorporate structure includes a Board of Directors and four Deputy General Manager positions\nto lessen the span of management control, which was a major problem with the previous\nstructure. The restructuring establishes EdL as an autonomous corporate body with a defined\nrole and set of responsibilities, while at the same time providing it with the tools to become a\nmodern utility, able to deal effectively with private sector sponsors. The restructuring has also\nseen the creation of a Department of Electricity within the Ministry of Industry and Handicraft,\nresponsible for policy issues including initial approval of the tariff structure. This has been a\nmajor change in policy, with the Government assuming the role of the regulator of the power\nsubsector as opposed to being its operator.\n9. To meet the Government's objective of improving the corporate financial and\nmanagement capacity of EdLto accelerate operational performance in the power subsector, EdL\nwill require assistance in developing a sound business plan and a revenue base to ensure future\nviability. This is particularly important as EdL enters a phase of rapid expansion within the\ncountry as well as entering into several joint venture agreements with the private sector.\n10. The scope of work to be undertaken through the TA conforms to the Bank's\nsectoral strategy. As outlined in the Bank's 1996 Country Assistance Plan for Lao PDR, one of\nthe objectives of the Bank's interim operational strategy is to provide for policy ana'ysis and\nadministrative reforms to provide the policy and institutional framework necessary for\ndevelopment and for private sector participation in the power subsector. The establishment of\na modern and efficient power utility capable of meeting the demand of supplying reasonably\npriced electricity to sectors of the economy is a vital part of this strategy. The scope of work\ncovered under the TA also conforms to the Government's objective of establishing EdL as a\nprofitable State-owned corporation able to effectively fulfill the power needs of the country.\nIll. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n11.\t The objectives of the TA are to assist EdL in the development of a five-year\ncorporate plan and to update a 1990 national tariff study prepared under Bank assistance.\nB.\t Scope\n12. The scope of the TA will include (i) definition and evaluation of alternative\nstrategies for EdL's operation during 1996-2000, while identifying an operational strategy that\noffers the best prospects for EdL's ongoing evolution as a profitable, autonomous, and self-\nfinancing institution able to fully support the Government's objectives for the promotion of private\nsector investment activity and for the development of the power subsector in Lao PDR;\n--\t\n,Il,lIlIVlJ!I.l(J\nL_ --_\t I .\t -\t ,, I\t", "ru\n(ii) development of a corporate plan for EdL's operations through the year 2000 that will provide\nfor the most effective implementation of the operational strategy; and (iii) development of a tariff\nstructure (based on voltage levels and consumption patterns) to meet sector financial and social\nobjectives. The terms of reference and the required person-months of the experts are shown in\nAppendix 1.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n13. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $390,000 equivalent, consisting of\n$340,000 in foreign exchange cost and $50,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The Bank will\nfinance the entire foreign exchange cost of $340,000. The TA will be financed by the Bank on\na grant basis. The Government has agreed to make available suitably qualified and experienced\ncounterpart staff, office accommodations, office supplies, local transport, local communication\nfacilities, and administrative support, equivalent to $50,000. Details of the cost estimates are\nattached as Appendix 2.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n14. EdL will be the Executing Agency for the TA. EdL has completed several Bank-\nfinanced projects and TAs in the power subsector, and its overall performance has been\nsatisfactory. Consultants will be selected by the Bank in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines\non the Use of Consultants. The services will be provided by a team of experts from an\ninternational consulting firm with experience in developing of corporate plans and in electric\npower tariff studies. The TA will require about 12 person-months of consulting services spread\nover a period of six months. A tripartite meeting among the Government, the Bank, and the\nconsultants will be held after the submission of the draft final report. The work is expected to\ncommence in June 1996 and to be completed by November 1996.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n15. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved\nthe provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Lao People's\nDemocratic Republic in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $340,000 for the purpose of\nthe Corporate and Financial Development of Electricit\u00e9 du Lao, and hereby reports such action\nto the Board.", "5\nAppendix 1, page 1\nBROAD TERMS OF REFERENCE\n\t\nA.
