INTRODUCTION \n1.  A  state  of  environment  (SOE)  report  has  been  prepared  by  the  United  Nations \nEnvironment and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) every 5 years since \n1985. Since 1990, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided technical and financial \nsupport  to  UNESCAP  for  the  preparation  of  the  SOE  report  and  the  organization  of  the \nassociated Ministerial Conference on Environment and Development (MCED). In addition, in \n2001 and 2005 ADB published a companion document to the SOE, the Asian Environment \nOutlook (AEO) to provide its developing member countries with (i) in-depth analysis of key \ntrends  in  environmental  performance  and  management  and  (ii)  high-level  policy  advice  to \nimprove the mainstreaming of environmental considerations in economic development planning \nand decision making.  \n \n2.  The assessments provided by the SOEs and the AEOs have been consistently used by \na wide range of stakeholders including policy makers, researchers, civil society representatives, \nand the wider public. The SOE reports, and more recently the AEO reports, have also been key \ninputs to the MCED meetings, highlighting policy options for priority environmental issues. \n \n3.  Recent  discussions  among  ADB,  UNESCAP,  and  the  United  Nations  Environment \nProgramme (UNEP) have stressed the need for the SOE report to become less a descriptive \nand scientific publication and more an analytical report to better support policy discussions, \nplanning, and decision making. As a result, instead of having two separate publications in 2010, \nthe three organizations have decided to jointly produce the 2010 AEO.  \n \n4.  The 2010 AEO will serve as a key input and background resource document for the \n2010 MCED meeting scheduled for mid-2010 in Kazakhstan. Given the timing, and in view of \nthe need to start preparing the report soon, UNESCAP requested in 2008 ADB and UNEP \ntechnical and financial assistance in preparing the publication. A technical assistance (TA) Fact-\nFinding Mission was fielded in January 2009 to respond to this request and consider how best \nto  provide  ADB  assistance  through  proposed  TA  for  the  2010  AEO.1 This  TA  has  been \nformulated to provide support to the preparation of the joint publication in time for the MCED \n2010 meeting and for further launching and disseminating its findings and outputs at several \nassociated events related to sustainable development, environment, and climate change. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Despite robust economic growth in recent years, countries in the Asia and Pacific region \nhave generally made limited progress in achieving environmentally sustainable and inclusive \ngrowth. From an environmental standpoint, this has resulted in such problems as worsening \nurban air and water pollution, continuing soil erosion, accelerated desertification and water \nscarcity, and the loss of endangered species and vital natural habitats, including forests and \ncoral reefs. Without timely and proper interventions to shift economic growth patterns, these \nenvironmental problems and the compounding effects of climate change\u2014shortages of water \nand food and greater risks to health and life that are already happening\u2014will worsen in the \nfuture. The challenge to the region is, therefore, to ensure that the ongoing environmental \ndegradation is halted so that it will neither undermine development processes nor reverse the \n                                                 \n1  The research and development TA concept entered the Regional and Sustainable Development Department 2008\u2013\n2010 regional TA program on 9 July 2007 under the title Asian Environment Outlook 2010. The TA is classified as \ncategory B (simple project). It first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 April \n2009. \n ", "2   \npoverty reduction gains achieved. It is now widely believed that this goal can be achieved \nthrough a shift to an environmentally sustainable growth pattern, also called \"green growth.\" \n \n6.  Asian and Pacific societies are likely to face worsening environment-related risks during \nthe 21st century, as most countries in the region are already highly vulnerable to natural \ndisasters. Climate change projections indicate that extreme weather and such hydrological \nhazards as floods and droughts are likely to become more frequent and intense, and that poor \nand marginalized groups will be the most vulnerable to related risks because of their existing \nexposure to water, food, and health insecurity. The projected rate and magnitude of climate \nchange and its likely impacts are far beyond the adaptive capacity of many communities, \nespecially the poorest. Options and capacity to mitigate these risks will largely depend on the \nresilience of socioeconomic and environmental systems facing these mounting environmental \npressures and worsening risk profiles. \n \n7.  Asia\u2019s rapid economic growth in recent years, combined with brisk urbanization and \ncontinued population increase, is changing consumption patterns for a wide range of material, \nenergy, and water resources to an unprecedented degree. Various forms of waste\u2014solid waste, \nair pollutants, greenhouse gases, lost heat, contaminated water, and lost water\u2014are generated \nwith costs to human health and economic efficiency that threaten the prosperity of the region \nand its advances in poverty reduction. Efficiency of resource use in production and consumption \nremains low by global standards and generates a lot of waste per unit of products or services \ncreated.  Improving  resource  efficiency is  becoming  increasingly  important  to  achieving \nsustainable development and the Millennium Development Goals. New approaches to reducing, \nreusing, and recycling wastes are essential to the sustainable future of Asian and Pacific \neconomies.  \n \n8.  The call to adopt environmentally sustainable economic growth has been issued in \ndifferent forms, including the SOE 2005 and its associated fifth MCED. This call is even more \nurgent now, as climate change has highlighted the impact of economic growth on environmental \nsystems,  and  regional  governments  increasingly  struggle  to  mainstream  concern  for  the \nenvironment into economic planning and decision making. In relation to this, UNESCAP and its \npartners, including ADB, have recently moved beyond the advocacy phase of promoting green \ngrowth into capacity building and pressure for policy action regionally and nationally. This \nrequires  deeper  insights  into  factors  affecting  the  environmental  sustainability  of  economic \ngrowth and better support for decision makers and key stakeholders, including those in the \nprivate sector, regarding policy options. \n \n9.  With respect to ADB, recent institutional and corporate strategy developments have \nreaffirmed the centrality and urgency of the green growth agenda. In particular, through its long-\nterm strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020),2 ADB has confirmed the importance of \nenvironmentally sustainable growth in its mission to reduce poverty by identifying environmental \nsustainability as one of the three pillars of the strategy and environmental investments as one of \nthe five core areas of operations. ADB's Environment Policy (2002) and several other sector \npolicies  with  environmental  relevance  provide  additional  guidance. In  response  to  Strategy \n2020, several new programs and activities are emerging to deal with the environmental and \nclimate change challenges facing the region. Collaboration with UNESCAP, UNEP, and other \npartners for the 2010 AEO is considered an essential element of this response. \n \n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2008.

It is not yet sufficiently clear how environmentally sustainable economic growth can best \nbe characterized and promoted, especially in terms of the key economic policy drivers or the \nindicators that may be useful for monitoring sustainability outcomes. There is an urgent need to \n(i) understand the nature of sustainability and the linkages between economic growth patterns \nand social and environmental outcomes, (ii) monitor progress towards decoupling economic \ngrowth from environmental pressure, and (iii) explore policy options that are applicable to Asian \nand Pacific development contexts. The 2010 AEO exercise will thus be centered on making \ngreen growth operational and, in particular, on its two key dimensions of enhanced resilience3 \nand resource efficiency.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The intended impact of the proposed TA is to improve the understanding of decision \nmakers and key stakeholders regarding the main trends and policy implications of promoting \nenvironmentally sustainable economic growth. In particular, the TA is expected to document and \ndisseminate in the region analyses of key factors affecting environmental sustainability, such as \nthe resilience and resource efficiency of economic development processes. TA findings will \ninclude priority options and recommendations for sustainable development policy and financing.    \n \n12.  The outputs of the TA will be (i) the 2010 AEO (main report), (ii) a 2010 AEO highlights \nor summary, (iii) short policy briefs for ministerial readers, and (iv) the launch of the main report \nand other TA outputs, as well as their dissemination at associated international events on the \nenvironment. The primary output of the TA is the publication of the 2010 AEO, which will assess \nenvironmental sustainability patterns and prospects for Asian and Pacific developing countries, \nespecially in terms of the resilience and resource efficiency of economic growth in the region, \nwith  recommendations  to  decision  makers  regarding  high-priority  policy  actions,  financing \nmechanisms, and other interventions to promote sustainable development. Secondary outputs \nwill include the highlights or summary of the main publication, ministerial policy briefs, and the \nextensive dissemination of the findings of the report, to be initiated by a major media launch \nduring the MCED meeting in 2010. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will produce the following outputs: \n(i)  Output 1: 2010 AEO.  The report will be jointly produced by ADB, UNESCAP, \nand UNEP, with UNESCAP ultimately responsible for finalizing and publishing it. \nThe report will be prepared by a select group of international experts and other \ncontributing organizations coordinated by the three agencies. \n(ii)  Output 2: 2010 AEO highlights or summary. The team of experts will prepare \na  publication  presenting  the  highlights  or  a  summary  of  the  main  report, \nemphasizing its major findings and key policy recommendations.  \n(iii)  Output 3: 2010 AEO policy briefs. A number of topical policy briefs will be \nprepared based on the main report as additional TA products. These briefs will \n                                                 \n3 Resilience has been defined as the ability to recover from or adjust easily to adverse impacts or change. Applied to \necological systems and by extension to socioeconomic systems, resilience is the capacity of a system to bounce \nback and return to its original state after a disaster or major impact or change. More generally, resilience is the \namount of disturbance a system can absorb and remain in the same state and the degree to which a system is \ncapable of recovery and self-organization. Resilience has been increasingly used as a term describing a system's \ncapacity to adapt to climate change.  \n ", "4   \nbe published as short, attractive documents intended to provide ministers and \nother key policy makers with cutting-edge analysis of policy options on specific \ntopics  such  as  renewable  energy,  climate  change  and  resilience,  resource \nefficiency, and environmental vulnerability, among others.  \n(iv)  Output 4: Launch and dissemination of the main report and associated TA \noutputs. Through the TA, the principal findings of the analysis will be launched \nduring the MCED 2010. Other major environment-related events will be identified \nfor disseminating the findings and outputs of the report. These may include the \n2010 Conference of Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity in Japan \nand the Commission on Sustainable Development meeting in 2010.  \n \n14.  A few additional thematic studies associated with the 2010 AEO main report will be \nprepared by UNESCAP and UNEP, using their own resources and focusing on specific areas \nsuch as low-carbon development and resource efficiency. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total TA cost is estimated at $613,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $500,000 as a \ngrant from its TA funding program (TASF-IV). UNEP will provide on a parallel basis, $90,000 \nequivalent, and UNESCAP will provide, on a parallel basis, $23,000 equivalent for the TA. \nDetails of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 15 months commencing in May 2009 and ending in \nAugust 2010. \n \n17.  ADB is the Executing Agency for the TA, which will be co-implemented by ADB and \nUNESCAP in close coordination with UNEP. ADB will take the lead in recruiting and managing \nconsultants for the TA, in close coordination with UNESCAP, in consultation with UNEP, and in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  Three  individual  international  consultants  will  be  recruited  under  the  regional  TA. A \nsustainable development policy specialist will be responsible for oversight and quality control of \nthe main report and its preparation, with inputs of 5 person-months. An environment policy \nspecialist will be recruited for 3 person-months and a resource economist for 4 person-months. \nThe outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. Additional individual national consultants, \nincluding a publication and communication specialist, will be hired to carry out technical editing \nand other work related to the launch events; promotion of the report; and production of report \nhighlights, brochures, posters, and other promotional materials, both web based and not. All \nconsultants will be intermittently based in UNESCAP headquarters office in Bangkok. \n \n18.  ADB, UNESCAP, and UNEP will jointly prepare the outputs of the TA. UNESCAP, in \nconsultation with ADB and UNEP, will be the agency in charge of organizing the MCED meeting \nin  2010  and  responsible  for  managing  the  finalization  and  publication  of  the  2010  AEO, \nincluding  research  coordination  and  text  preparation,  collaboration,  expert  discussions  and \nreview, and the editing and printing of the report and other promotional materials. UNESCAP \nwill take the lead in launching and promoting the report. TA support for MCED and other \nenvironment-related events will be included in the international sustainable development policy \nspecialist\u2018s contract as a provisional amount. The TA will provide support for resource persons, \nincluding ADB staff, who will participate in the MCED meeting and related launch events.  \n \n ", "  5\n19.

A series of crises \nsignals the tightening of the multidimensional links between a globalizing economy and the natural \ncapital upon which it relies. The need to focus on policies that synergize environmental protection \nand economic growth is greater than ever. The section stresses that a major crisis can either lead \nto spiraling negative economic, social, and environmental change or to opportunity for improving \nthe  functions  and  performance  of  socioeconomic  systems  through  improved  resilience  and \nresource efficiency and by addressing other emerging sustainability priorities. \n \nChapter 1. The current crisis and the changing sustainable development context \nChapter 2. Green growth, resource efficiency, and resilience \n \nPart II \n \nSustainability assessment: How are we performing? \n \nThis section will describe the current and future performance of Asian and Pacific countries, as far \nas possible using comparable data and multilevel analysis and focusing on the use of sustainability \nindicators  and  other  relevant  indices.  After  a  conceptual  introduction  on  sustainability,  green \ngrowth, and the use of sustainability indicators and indexes, each successive subsection of chapter \n3 will present data on sustainability and green growth indicators for specific subthemes and by \ncountry,  with  initial  conclusions  in  relation  to  trends  and  prospects.2 Chapter  4  will  draw \nconclusions on overall performance, trends and trajectories, and future risks and opportunities. It \nwill look at what policy gaps exist and why, pointing the way forward from assessment to new \npolicy directions. The discussion will be supplemented by case studies where appropriate. \n \nChapter 3. Sustainability assessment \nChapter 4. Trends, risks, and opportunities \n \nPart III \n \nTowards sustainability: Arenas for action \n \nThis section will be future oriented. It will explore key sustainability themes in some detail. Each \ntheme will be analyzed in terms of current status and future scenarios, short- and long-term \npriorities, and \u201cquick win\u201d policies and interventions, focusing on triple bottom line (economic, \nsocial,  and  environmental)  benefits,  cost  effectiveness,  specific  sectors,  and  livelihood  and \nemployment benefits.
