" \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  During an Asian Development Bank (ADB) power sector reconnaissance mission in \nJune 2005, the Government of the Fiji Islands requested ADB\u2019s assistance in developing the \npower  sector.  Following  a  request  for  technical  assistance  (TA)  by  the  Government  in \nDecember 2005 to prepare a renewable power sector development project, an ADB fact-finding \nmission  visited  the  Fiji  Islands  from  12  to  16 December  2005.  The  mission  reached  an \nunderstanding with the Government and the Fiji Electricity Authority (FEA) on the objectives, \nscope, cost and financing, and implementation arrangements, and the consultants\u2019 outline terms \nof reference for the TA.1 The concept paper for the proposed TA was approved on 23 December \n2005. The TA will support the development of a renewable least-cost expansion plan to diversify \nenergy resources and meet expected future load growth. The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The economic performance of the Fiji Islands has been mixed. Exceptionally high growth \nof 9% in gross domestic product (GDP) in 1999 was followed by a sharp economic contraction \nas a result of the military coup in 2000. But economic growth has recovered since then, mainly \nbecause of an increase in construction activities and tourism. Annual economic growth has \naveraged about 3% over the last 5 years. Continued investments in several sectors are key, to \ndiversify the production base and make the country less vulnerable to adverse global market \nevents, create employment opportunities, and sustain economic growth and poverty reduction. \n \n3.  FEA, a corporate utility fully owned by the Government, is responsible for grid supply in \nthe Fiji Islands. With the completion of the rural electrification program in 2004, FEA provides \nelectricity services to about 125,000 consumers, or about half of the population, on the two main \nislands of Vanua Levu and Viti Levu and on the smaller island of Ovalau. Electricity demand has \nbeen growing at 5% yearly in the last 5 years and is expected to continue to grow faster than \nGDP in the medium term. This growth in demand is driven mainly by the commercial sectors.  \n \n4.  The total installed capacity of the FEA system is 186 megawatts (MW), including about \n70 MW of diesel generation. Of the 90 MW of hydropower generation, 80 MW is from the \nMonasavu hydropower scheme. FEA is now undertaking a small pilot solar generation project2 \nand  pilot  projects involving  vegetable  oil  mixtures  in  place  of  diesel  generation.  FEA  also \nsupplements its capacity from three independent power producers and has entered into a joint \nventure with the private sector for 6 MW and 2.8 MW hydropower schemes. In addition, a 10 \nMW wind power plant will be commissioned in 2006.  \n \n5.  Ensuring that generation, transmission, and distribution capacity is enough to meet \nelectricity demand is a key challenge facing the power sector. To meet growing demand and \nreplace obsolete diesel generators, FEA installed 41 MW of diesel capacity in 2004\u20132005. In \n2002, about 15% of FEA\u2019s total costs went to fuel costs. By 2004, with global fuel prices \nincreasing and FEA having to meet the growing demand through diesel generation, fuel costs \nhad  risen  to  38%  of  total  costs.  Tariffs  were  increased.  That  same  year,  the  Commerce \nCommission, which regulates tariffs, approved a cumulative tariff increase of 9.9% for domestic \nconsumers and 20% for nondomestic consumers in 2005\u20132007. To protect poor consumers \nfrom rising fuel prices, the Government introduced a lifeline tariff. Given the sharp fluctuations in \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 8 December 2005. \n2  At a high cost of supply of about F$0.40/kilowatt-hour (kWh). \n ", "2   \nfuel prices on the world markets, the generation mix must improve to make the cost of supply of \nelectricity more predictable. \n \n6.  The  Government\u2019s  Strategic  Development  Plan  for  2003\u20132005  looks  forward  to  a \nresource-efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable energy sector. To this end, \nFEA has embarked on a strategy to diversify its generation sources and promote clean and \nrenewable energy. This will reduce the exposure of FEA, and ultimately the consumers, to \nforeign exchange risks and global fuel price hikes.   \n \n7.  FEA\u2019s corporate plan makes explicit its commitment to the development of renewable \nenergy resources. It has carried out a comprehensive long-term planning study on renewable \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution upgrades, to meet the growing demand, promote \nrenewable  energy  resources,  and  replace  obsolete  diesel  generation.  The  total  financing \nrequirements for 2005\u20132010 are estimated at $300 million, including FEA\u2019s own investments \nand participation by the private sector. \n \n8.  The Government\u2019s and FEA\u2019s commitment to renewable energy is consistent with the \nneed to adapt to climate change and variability (CCV). The effects of climate change are being \nfelt through climate extremes such as unusually intense or unseasonal cyclones, flooding, \ndroughts, and other natural phenomena. Scientific evidence indicates that some extreme events \nwill  become  more  frequent  or  intensify  in  the  decades  to  come.  Countries  in  the  Pacific, \nincluding the Fiji Islands, are vulnerable to CCV, according to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The country remains vulnerable to future changes \nin the regional climate that could increase the risks and reduce the benefits of economic \ndevelopment.  Therefore,  it  must  adapt  to  become  less  vulnerable.  Adaptation  will  mean \nreducing  both  present  and  future  risks  related  to  CCV  by  \u201cclimate-proofing\u201d  the  proposed \nprojects to withstand extreme climate events. In this way, the Fiji Islands will become more \nresilient to the effects of CCV and the Project will more likely be sustainable. \n \n9.  The Kyoto Protocol requires developed countries to reduce their carbon emissions from \n1990 levels by 5.2% by 2008\u20132012. Under its flexible mechanisms, industrialized countries that \nare obliged to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions can purchase some of those reductions \nin developing countries or transition economies in exchange for clean technology and additional \nfinancing. Developing countries thus gain an opportunity to participate in a growing carbon \nmarket.  Flexible  market  mechanisms  like  the  clean  development  mechanism  (CDM)  are \navailable.  The  CDM  generates  advantages  for  all  participants,  as  the  achieved  emission \nreduction is measured and credited toward the emission commitments of the investing countries. \nInvestment  funding  in  support  of  renewable  energy  sources  and  energy  efficiency  can  be \nmobilized this way for countries like the Fiji Islands.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA supports FEA\u2019s power sector investment program by assisting in the preparation \nof a least-cost expansion program for renewable and indigenous resources, and the upgrading \nof the transmission and distribution networks to enable FEA to provide end-consumers with \nenough, reliable electricity services. The investment program will help the country and FEA, and \nultimately end-consumers, to reduce exposure to global fuel prices by promoting indigenous and \nrenewable energy resources.  \n \n ", "  3\nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA activities will cover the following key areas: (i) review and sensitivity analysis of \nFEA\u2019s prioritized least-cost power sector expansion program to meet low-, base-, and high-\ndemand  forecasts;  (ii)  review  of  FEA\u2019s  engineering  feasibility  studies  of  prioritized  core \nsubprojects; (iii) assessment and projection of FEA\u2019s financial performance; (iv) financial and \neconomic analyses of the investment program, including risk analysis; (v) compliance with \nADB\u2019s safeguard policies; (vi) climate-proofing analysis of the proposed project; and (vii) CDM \nscreening of FEA\u2019s investment program.  \n \n12.  The review of the least-cost power expansion program will take into account demand \nforecasts, generation alternatives, and the appropriate generation mix. Two FEA staff members \nwill be trained in demand forecasting. Existing feasibility studies of prioritized core subprojects \nwill be reviewed, and procurement arrangements, including contract packages and a project \nimplementation schedule, will be prepared.  \n \n13.  Since individual subprojects\u2014which will not yield benefits if considered singly\u2014are part \nof the power sector expansion program, a time-slice approach will be used in the economic and \nfinancial  analyses  of  the  Project.  A  distribution  analysis  will  be  conducted  to  assess  the \ndistribution of net benefits and cross-subsidies among key stakeholders. Risks and the effects \nof various delays in generation plants on financial and economic results will be analyzed. FEA\u2019s \nfinancial  performance  will  be  subjected  to  financial  due  diligence  and  projections,  and \nappropriate financial performance measures will be set.  \n14.  FEA, through its land department, has identified landowners and has obtained their \nagreement  to  the  investigation  activities  for  the  proposed  core  subprojects.  To  ensure \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard polices on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous peoples, the TA will review FEA\u2019s existing work and the Government\u2019s procedures \nand, if necessary, conduct supplementary detailed field surveys for core subprojects, including \naccess roads. The surveys will cover planned generation sites, the alignment of transmission \nlines  and  sites  of  substations  and  power  stations,  and  any  necessary  access  roads.  The \nsurveys will be made to identify environmental effects and to prepare a full inventory of all land \nand other affected assets and a socioeconomic assessment of project-affected households. All \ninformation will be gender-disaggregated. A resettlement plan conforming to ADB\u2019s policies will \nbe prepared for core subprojects, and a resettlement framework will be drawn up to guide the \npreparation of subprojects under the loan. The resettlement plan will include the necessary \ncompensation  and  income  restoration  measures;  the  most  suitable  implementation \narrangements; public information, disclosure, and grievance procedures; and the cost of the \ncompensation and income restoration measures. The initial poverty and social analysis is in \nAppendix 2. \n \n15.  FEA has done substantial work in the environmental assessment of selected subprojects. \nThe Department of Energy has approved the environmental assessment of one of the proposed \ncore subprojects. The TA will review this work and prepare an initial environmental examination, \naccording to ADB\u2019s guidelines for environmental assessment for sector loans. Subprojects will \nbe  assessed  according  to  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and  environmental  assessment,  and  review \nprocedures, including criteria for subproject selection, will be established for subprojects to be \nidentified under the loan. The environmental assessment will review and evaluate the following: \n(i) the environmental soundness of the concept, approach, and prospective sites of the core \nsubprojects; (ii) major environmental concerns and benefits; and (iii) mitigation measures and a \nmonitoring plan. Any adverse effects identified will be incorporated into the project design and \n ", "4   \nconsidered  in  the  implementation.  The  cost  of  mitigation  measures  and  the  associated \nenvironmental management and monitoring plan will be estimated, and the estimates will be part \nof  the project cost estimates. The environmental assessment and the resulting environmental \nmanagement plans will be aimed at preventing, reducing, or relieving adverse effects on the \nenvironment and the third parties. Field visits will be made to collect data and local interest \ngroups will be consulted so that their views and concerns are considered in the project design.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at US$930,000, comprising US$557,000 in foreign \nexchange and US$373,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested ADB \nto finance US$650,000, comprising the entire foreign exchange cost and a portion of the local \ncurrency cost amounting to US$93,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The  Government  will  finance  the remaining US$280,000 \nequivalent in local currency through in-kind contributions from FEA. Government counterpart \nfunds will cover the costs associated with office accommodation and facilities and counterpart \nstaff. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has \nbeen informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The  Ministry  of  Works  and  Energy,  through  its  Department  of  Energy,  will  be  the \nExecuting Agency. It has designated FEA as the Implementing Agency for the TA. Before \nfielding the consultants, FEA has agreed to nominate counterpart staff with adequate capacity in \nengineering  and  power  system  planning,  finance,  environment,  and  social  areas.  FEA  will \nassign  appropriate  counterpart  staff  for  field  visits.  It  will  also  provide  all  the  necessary \nassistance to the TA consultants in coordinating with other government ministries and agencies, \nand in obtaining the necessary data and documentation, including high-quality detailed maps for \nthe routing of transmission lines, and for the locations of substations and generation plants.  \n \n18.  The TA will require about 19 person-months of international and 5 person-months of \ndomestic consulting services. It will be implemented over an 8-month period from February to \nSeptember 2006. Appendix 4 gives outline terms of reference for the consultants. At the start of \nTA implementation, a tripartite meeting will be held to discuss the work to be done by the \nconsultants and ADB\u2019s requirements related to resettlement. Tripartite meetings at which FEA \nand the consultants will be present will also be held after the interim and draft final reports are \nsubmitted. The environment, resettlement, and social specialists will be fielded once the core \nsubprojects have been identified. The consultants will prepare status reports on their specific \nscope of work, highlighting issues that could be critical to the timely completion of the TA. The \nconsultants will arrange for on-the-job training for relevant FEA staff members.  \n \n19.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  individually  to  ensure  that  key  loan  processing \ndeadlines are met and that investments are made on time. For effective coordination, a project \ncoordinator will be hired to assist ADB in coordinating the inputs of the individual experts. The \nconsultants will be hired by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the hiring of domestic consultants. Computer \nsoftware will be procured according to arrangements acceptable to ADB and turned over to FEA \nafter the TA. \n \n \n ", "  5\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.

No \nNot applicable  Not applicable \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Fiji Islands: \nDiversification of economic growth and foreign and local investments are critical to sustainable economic growth and \nincreased employment opportunities. Reliable power supply is important for continued diversification of the production \nbase, which will bring about employment and increase productivity in the agriculture and service sectors. \n \nThe country is a small open economy, highly vulnerable to global energy prices. With recent hikes in energy prices, \nthe pressure to increase power tariffs has intensified. The poor spend more of their income on fuel and energy, \nincluding electricity, than the nonpoor. The fiscal space to support subsidies to the poor is very limited. Diversification \nof generation toward indigenous and renewable energy resources will help reduce the pressure on tariff increases in \nthe longer term, possibly avoid the opportunity cost of fiscal expenditure on power subsidies, and make power more \naffordable to the poor.  \n \nThe increased use of indigenous resources will also reduce the impact of increased energy prices on the trade \nbalance and thus help improve external balances and economic growth.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? The poverty analysis will be an integral part of the social and participatory \nanalysis and will focus on vulnerability, particularly to fuel and energy prices. In addition, the Fiji Electricity Authority\u2019s \n(FEA\u2019s) disaggregated consumer base data, tariff blocks, and cross-subsidies will undergo economic and financial \nanalyses. A distribution analysis of net benefits and subsidies to key stakeholders will be conducted.  \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nConsultations with affected people have been undertaken by FEA. A stakeholder analysis will be an integral part of the \neconomic (distributional), social, and resettlement assessments. The stakeholder analysis under the economic and \nsocial assessments will be mainly descriptive and will assess the distribution of expected costs and benefits. For \ntransmission line routings, information will need to be gathered and people and local communities in affected areas \nwill need to be consulted. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?
