Developing human resources and skills competencies is the Eighth Flagship Program \nunder the Greater Mekong Subregion1 (GMS) program strategic framework. The GMS Regional \nCooperation  Strategy  and  Program  (RCSP,  March  2004)  aims  to  reduce  poverty  through \nenhanced connectivity, increased competitiveness, and a greater sense of community. The \nRCSP emphasizes the need to take precautions against the negative impacts associated with \nthese developments, such as communicable disease transmission, environmental degradation, \nand illegal trafficking. Many of these issues disproportionately affect vulnerable groups such as \nwomen, children, and ethnic minorities. At the 13th GMS Ministerial Meeting in December 2004, \nthe GMS governments highlighted the prevention of the transmission of communicable diseases \nacross borders, with particular attention to the developing threat of HIV/AIDS.2 \n2.  This technical assistance3 (TA) aims to reduce the vulnerability to, and risk of, HIV/AIDS \ntransmission among ethnic minority groups through communication strategies. The TA focuses \non ethnic minorities that live in cross-border areas in the GMS. An Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  regional  TA  (RETA),  begun  in  2002  and  completed  in  December  2004,  dealt  with \nHIV/AIDS in GMS areas.4 The proposed TA will build on the achievements of RETA 6083 by (i) \nscaling-up to address the increased risk of HIV/AIDS due to human trafficking and drug abuse; \nand (ii) scaling-out to include new ethnic groups prioritized by government partners.5 The TA will \nbuild on ADB\u2019s past work in strengthening the human capital of ethnic minorities, including \naddressing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, and will coordinate with ongoing TAs on human \ntrafficking and drug abuse in reducing structural vulnerabilities, for example citizenship and land \ntenure, among ethnic minorities in cross-border areas of the GMS.6 The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the GMS has changed significantly over the past decade. \nThe opening of national borders to tourism and trade in the region, not least through the \nsuccess  of  the  ADB-initiated  GMS  initiative,  has  increased  the  movement  of  goods  and \npopulations. Uneven economic growth and human development are also evident among GMS \ncountries,  especially  in  cross-border  and  remote  mountainous  areas.  Trends  in  human \ntrafficking and nontraditional drug use have also changed, as structural and socioeconomic \nvulnerabilities have led to behavior that put people at an increased risk of acquiring HIV/AIDS.  \n                                                 \n1 Cambodia,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC,  specifically  Yunnan  and  Guangxi  provinces),  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR), Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n2   Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 10 February 2004. The concept paper \nwas discussed and endorsed at a peer review meeting of the NPRS/PRF held on 28 June 2004. \n4  ADB. 2002.

Technical Assistance \nfor Drug Eradication in the GMS. (RETA 5970). Key lessons learned from past TAs follow: (i) participatory \napproaches take time and should be built into the TA design, and (ii) IEC approaches should be more focused and \nspecific to the target population.  \n ", "2   \n4.  The prevalence of HIV/AIDS varies in GMS countries, for example, in the nature of the \nepidemic and in the extent to which it has moved from high-risk groups into the broader \ncommunity.  In  2004,  about  20%  of  the  estimated  40  million  people  worldwide  living  with \nHIV/AIDS were from Asia and the Pacific, of which nearly one million were from the lower \nMekong subregion\u2014Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Thailand, and \nViet Nam. In the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), about 850,000 people out of 1.3 billion had \nHIV/AIDS.7  \n5.  Ethnic minority groups in the GMS are culturally diverse and linguistically complex. Of \nthe subregion\u2019s estimated 255 million people, about 75 million belong to about 200 ethnic \nminority  groups.  These  groups,  typically  concentrated  in  remote  mountainous  areas,  often \ndepend  on  subsistence  agriculture.  They  are  at  special  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  due  to  their \nremoteness,  poverty,  and  lack  of  access  to  health,  education,  and  culturally  appropriate \ninformation. A number of structural issues add to their vulnerability. Ethnic minority women are \nmore vulnerable to exploitation and at higher risk of HIV transmission. They are physically more \nsusceptible and have less power to make decisions due to existing gender disparities.  \n6.  The rate of HIV infection among ethnic minority groups is increasing faster than among \nthe general population. While their physical isolation has in the past offered some protection, it \nalso  limited  their  access  to  preventive  education  programs  and  campaigns.  Recent \ndevelopments  in  cross-border  infrastructure  links  have  begun  to  reverse  the  situation,  as \nimproved  access  allows  information  and  support  to  enter  these  once  isolated  areas. \nNevertheless,  one  significant  barrier  remains:  the  vast  number  of  languages  among  the \nestimated 200 ethnic minority groups, and the lack of culturally appropriate information available \nto them for awareness and prevention. RETA 6083 (footnote 4) was designed and implemented \nwith this complexity very much in mind; the proposed TA builds on the RETA\u2019s successful outcomes. \n7.  Increased drug use, especially among injecting drug users, has also aggravated the \nspread of HIV/AIDS in the GMS. HIV can be transmitted by sharing contaminated needles and \nsyringes. Drug trafficking routes in the GMS provide easy access to illicit drugs and encourage \nbehavior that makes individuals vulnerable and at high risk. For example, in Yunnan Province, \nabout 21% of female injecting drug users also engage in commercial sex work, thereby further \nincreasing their vulnerability and risk to HIV/AIDS. A key approach to reducing HIV transmission \namong drug users is through communication efforts aimed at changing behaviors and practices.  \n8.  RETA  6083  increased  awareness  about  risks  and  threats  among  ethnic  minorities \nthrough  development  of  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  systems  and \nmultimedia materials for HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention in local languages. RETA 6083 \nwas  implemented  by  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization \n(UNESCO) and the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization (SEAMEO). Innovative \napproaches to disseminating information on HIV/AIDS were developed and implemented. The \napproaches  adopted  community-based  research  and  were  culturally  and  linguistically \nappropriate, for example through the popular medium of radio soap operas. The activities were \nalso effective in initiating regional cooperation and dialogue on this sensitive subject among \ngovernments  in  GMS.  A  clearinghouse  facility  on  preventive  HIV/AIDS  education  for  the \nMekong border region, accessible through the Internet, was also created to help consolidate \ninformation on formal and nonformal methods of prevention. A geographic information system \n(GIS) exercise in Thailand led to animated HIV/AIDS distribution maps at the household level. \nKey lessons learned include (i) use of supplementary forms of communication for disseminating \n                                                 \n7  See UNAIDS website http://www.unaids.org \n ", "  3\nmessages from radio programs, (ii) targeting a broader population beyond young women, and \n(iii) local ownership in data audits and cleaning of data for GIS mapping.   \n9.  The proposed TA will adopt a regional approach to tackling HIV/AIDS vulnerability and \nrisk among populations living in cross-border areas where national boundaries are porous. First, \nthe populations of these border areas are highly transient, with migrant populations that come \ninto the areas for employment or trade, and then move on. Second, ethnic minorities living in \ncross-border areas share similar practices and encounter comparable challenges in reducing \ntheir vulnerabilities. Third, people of the same ethnic group often traverse physical country \nboundaries. Regional coordination helps the exchange of information, offers opportunities for \ncomparative analysis and learning, increases government commitment, and develops regional \nnetworks and capacities to better understand the impacts of HIV/AIDS on poverty and the \nquality of life, especially among ethnic minorities.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  Overall,  the  TA  will  contribute  to  ongoing  GMS  efforts  in  achieving  Millennium \nDevelopment Goal 6/Target 7 to halt and reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015. Through \ncommunication strategies, the TA aims to reduce the vulnerability to, and risk of, HIV/AIDS \namong ethnic minorities living in the cross-border areas of the GMS, specifically in Thailand, \nYunnan Province (PRC), Lao PDR, and Cambodia.8 The TA uses communication strategies to \ninform vulnerable and high-risk populations about HIV/AIDS prevention. The TA will (i) equip \nethnic minorities with the tools necessary to reduce their vulnerabilities and mitigate risks, (ii) \nsupport subregional cooperation in GMS countries for preventing HIV/AIDS, and (iii) monitor \nand evaluate the effectiveness of HIV/AIDS communication strategies used in the TA.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n11.  The TA will cover three key activities: (i) reducing risk of and vulnerability to HIV/AIDS by \nusing  communication  strategies,  including  pilot  broadcasting  in  low-resource  settings;  (ii) \nexpanding ICT activities to include GIS vulnerability mapping for the Lao PDR and Cambodia \nand,  possibly,  digital  radio  broadcasts  via  satellite;  and  (iii)  performance  monitoring  and \nevaluation (M&E) of the adopted HIV/AIDS communication strategies.  \n12.  Reducing Risk and Vulnerability Using Communication Strategies. This activity will \n(i) develop four new radio dramas9 in Thailand (for the Akha); Yunnan, PRC (for the Dai Neua \nand Moso); and Lao PDR (for the Khmu); (ii) broadcast radio programs in Thailand (Radio \nThailand Chiang Mai), PRC (Yunnan People\u2019s Radio), and Lao PDR (Lao National Radio); and \n(iii)  evaluate  the  impact  of  radio  programs  on  awareness  and  prevention  in  the  targeted \ncommunities. By creating awareness among ethnic minorities of the increased risks of HIV/AIDS \ndue to human trafficking and drug abuse, the TA will equip ethnic minorities with the tools \nnecessary  for  preventing  HIV/AIDS.  Radio  dramas  are  an  example  of  research-based \ncommunication  strategies  that  can  be  used  to  disseminate  key  behavioral  messages. \nAudiotapes of radio dramas will be produced for local health workers to follow up on awareness \nactivities, and for village heads where broadcasting is not available, for example by using local \nloud speakers.   \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for HIV/AIDS Prevention against Youth \nProject. Manila (PPTA 4542) focuses on preventive education in Viet Nam. \n9  Government partners prioritized three ethnic groups. Selection was based on (i) population size; (ii) degree of risk \nto HIV transmission, human trafficking, and drug use; and (iii) future threats or links with rapid development in an \narea due to tourism or infrastructure development. \n ", "4   \n13.  The TA will also pilot radio broadcasting in low-resource settings where established \nbroadcasting infrastructure and entities in ethnic minority languages are unavailable. The need \nto  pilot  radio  broadcasting  among  smaller  ethnic  minority  groups  is  urgent;  connectivity, \nfacilitation of cross-border movement of goods and people, and tourism bring a potentially \nhigher risk of HIV transmission to local communities living in previously remote areas. For \nexample, RETA 6083 identified that ethnic minority groups in Cambodia\u2019s Ratanakiri Province \nare more vulnerable to these developments than the population at large; almost two thirds of the \nprovince\u2019s 100,000 people are ethnic minorities.10 These people are among the poorest and \nmost vulnerable segments of Cambodia's population due to their physical and cultural isolation. \nThe TA will develop a community-based radio program that will be transmitted by appropriate \nmeans, including the feasibility of using low-cost digital radio transmission by satellite.  \n14.  Expanding  ICT  Activities  and  Networks. This activity builds and expands on ICT \nefforts from RETA 6083 to cover new information gathered during its implementation. The \nactivity  will  include  (i)  expanding  the  HIV/AIDS  Clearinghouse  on  Preventive  HIV/AIDS \nEducation for the Mekong Border Region; (ii) expanding the GIS for vulnerability mapping in the \nLao PDR and Cambodia, and (iii) initiating a network of regional universities and research \ninstitutions to upgrade the quality of sociocultural research on HIV/AIDS and human trafficking.11 \nThe purpose of GIS is to connect databases with information related to (i) HIV/AIDS incidence, \ninterventions, and coverage; and (ii) distribution of the population at risk. Through the inclusion \nof new epidemiological data and sharing of activity and organizational updates, successful GIS \nis an effective strategic planning and management tool for governments and development \npartners in developing future project activities.  \n15.  Monitoring and Evaluation. This activity will focus specifically on M&E of TA activities. \nAt the start of the TA, a plan will be developed, using community-based monitoring approaches. \nAn output of the plan will be an end-of-TA report that will assess the effectiveness of the \nadopted communication strategies for preventing HIV/AIDS among ethnic minority groups in \nGMS. The report will include an indicative list of lessons learned, suggestions for enhanced \nregional cooperation, and identification of structural vulnerabilities contributing to an increased \nrisk from HIV/AIDS. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.222 million equivalent. Detailed cost estimates \nand the financing plan are in Appendix 2. ADB will provide $700,000 equivalent, financed on a \ngrant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund and to be administered by ADB. The \nTA  will  finance  consulting  services;  basic  equipment  and  supplies;  training,  research  and \nproduction of radio programming materials and tapes; advocacy; and workshops. UNESCO will \nprovide parallel cofinancing of $522,000 equivalent for consulting services, community radio \nbroadcasting, workshops, advocacy, office accommodation, and utilities. Participating countries \nwill contribute in-kind for the use of radio station facilities and airtime, data sets, and staff.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  Implementing arrangements agreed upon between ADB and UNESCO for RETA 6083 \nsigned on 28 March 2003 (footnote 4) will be followed. For this TA, the Social Sectors Division, \nMekong Department will be the Executing Agency and UNESCO will be the Implementing \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2005. Kingdom of Cambodia, Country Strategy Program, 2005\u20132009. Manila. \n11 UNESCO has budgeted two regional conferences in September 2005 on ethical standards and research in \ntrafficking and HIV/AIDS: (i) HIV/AIDS and Social Science Research, and (ii) Socio-Cultural Research on Human \nTrafficking (with the Asia Foundation). \n ", "  5\nAgency. The TA management unit that was established for RETA 6083 within UNESCO will \noversee this TA to ensure continuity and incorporation of lessons learned. Each participating \ncountry will be an implementing partner and will designate counterpart staff to be focal points for \nimplementing the TA. Implementation will be guided by a steering committee comprising ADB, \nUNESCO, and government focal points.12  \n \n18.  UNESCO will make use of government agencies, nongovernment and community-based \norganizations, and research institutions. In addition, it will provide country-level support through \nthe UNESCO offices in Bangkok and Phnom Penh, and UNESCO national commission in each \ncountry.  As  overall  focal  point,  an  administrative  secretariat  will  be  housed  at  UNESCO \nheadquarters in Bangkok. UNESCO will be responsible for administering the TA budget, with \nthe exception of consulting services for the M&E specialist.  \n \n19.  TA implementation will start in July 2005 and end in June 2007. A midterm review will be \nconducted in June 2006. UNESCO will prepare quarterly progress reports, in a format to be \nagreed upon with ADB, and submit them to ADB within 1 month of the end of the period to \nwhich they refer. The reports due at midterm and end of the TA will be replaced by more \ndetailed midterm and final reports, respectively. \n \n20.  All procurement financed by ADB under the Project will be in accordance with the local \ncompetitive bidding procedures of ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, and other arrangements \nacceptable to ADB. UNESCO will transfer all equipment to participating government counterpart \nagencies at the end of the TA.  \n \n21.  For the TA\u2019s consulting services, ADB will recruit UNESCO through direct selection. \nDirect selection of UNESCO is justified based on its past experience with RETA 6083, its \npartnerships with participating governments and community-based groups, and its contribution \nto  the  total  estimated  costs.  UNESCO  will  be  recruited  following  the  existing  agreement \nbetween UNESCO and ADB (para. 17). UNESCO will be responsible for selecting, recruiting, \nand supervising experts needed for implementation, with the exception of the M&E specialist, \nwho will be recruited as an individual by ADB. UNESCO will select and engage experts, based \non the terms of reference provided in Appendix 3, from among qualified nationals of ADB\u2019s \nmember countries using its standard procedures and those acceptable to ADB. In accordance \nwith its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, ADB will select an international consultant as an \nindividual to (i) develop an M&E plan for TA activities, and (ii) prepare a report on effective \ncommunication strategies for preventing HIV/AIDS among ethnic minority groups in GMS.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 to the Greater \nMekong Subregion to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund, \nfor  HIV/AIDS  Vulnerability  and  Risk  Reduction  among  Ethnic  Minority  Groups  through \nCommunication Strategies, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n12 Ministry of Information and Culture (Lao PDR), Government Public Relations Office (Thailand), Yunnan People\u2019s \nRadio (Yunnan Province, PRC), and Ministry of Education (Cambodia),   \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nContribute to ongoing  Reduced HIV/AIDS  Census  \u2022 Ethnic minorities are at high \nGMS efforts in achieving   prevalence among  M&E report  risk of acquiring HIV/AIDS in \nMDG 6/Target 7 to halt  vulnerable groups, specially  cross-border areas. \nand begin to reverse the  ethnic minority groups living  \u2022 Ethnic minorities are most \nspread of HIV/AIDS by  in cross-border areas   susceptible to exploitation and \n2015  drug abuse in cross-border \nareas.  \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nThrough communication  1.

Responsibilities of UNESCO \n \n1.  The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) will be \nresponsible for the design, development, and implementation of the following components of the \ntechnical assistance (TA): \n(i)  Communication strategies for reducing HIV/AIDS1 among ethnic minorities at \nhigher risk due to human trafficking and drug abuse in cross-border areas  \n \n(a)  Radio drama program development and broadcast \n \n(b)  Pilot broadcasting in low-resource settings \n \n(ii)  Expansion  of  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  activities  and \nnetworks \n \n(a)  Clearinghouse on Preventive HIV/AIDS Education for the Mekong Border \nRegion \n \n(b)  Geographic information system (GIS) for mapping vulnerability in the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and Cambodia  \n \n(c)  Establishment  of  a  network  of  regional  universities  and  research \ninstitutions to upgrade the quality of sociocultural research on HIV/AIDS \nand human trafficking \n \n1.  Communication Strategies for Reducing HIV/AIDS among Ethnic Minorities \n  a.  Radio Dramas  \n2.  UNESCO will review lessons learned from past Asian Development Bank (ADB)-funded \nTAs on HIV/AIDS, human trafficking, and drug use so as to incorporate best practices and avoid \nrepeating mistakes. Efforts will be made to coordinate with ongoing TAs among vulnerable \ngroups in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). \n3.  UNESCO will develop, test, and disseminate a series of educational radio programs and \naudiotapes in local languages/dialects aimed at preventing HIV/AIDS, as part of a linked triad of \nproblems: HIV/AIDS risk behavior, human trafficking, and drug abuse among ethnic minorities \nliving in cross-broader areas in GMS. Four groups have been identified as vulnerable to and at \nrisk from HIV/AIDS (Table A3):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n ", " 10  Appendix 3 \nTable A3: Vulnerable Ethnic Groups \nEthnic  Country  Estimated  Degree of Risk  Future  Broadcasting \nGroup  Population   Threats  Entity \nAkha  Thailand  0.5 million  The group is the most trafficked of the hill tribes,  Yes  Radio \n\u20131 million  have relatively high rates of intravenous drug  Thailand \nuse, and are at high risk for HIV/AIDS.

UNESCO will work with minority groups to develop programs, following UNESCO\u2019s \nmethodology for radio dramas,2on prevention in minority language which  will attract ethnic \nminority groups in cross-border areas\u2014especially those most vulnerable to and at risk from HIV \ntransmission (i.e., victims of human trafficking and drug users). This work will be undertaken in \nclose collaboration with Radio Thailand, Yunnan People\u2019s Radio, and Lao National Radio, which \nare established broadcast entities. \n \n5.  UNESCO will organize focus groups and use them to establish themes as well as story \nlines based on actual experiences. Follow-up focus groups will be used to test the programs for \nappropriateness and efficacy. UNESCO will (i) develop complementary learning materials in \nminority languages (or adapt them from current HIV/AIDS preventive education projects in \nThailand, Lao PDR, and People\u2019s Republic of China [PRC]); (ii) work with local departments of \nhealth or mass organizations to strengthen or develop community-based groups (e.g., youth or \nwomen\u2019s  groups,  community  learning  centers)  in  ethnic  minority  villages  that  can  provide \ncomplementary and follow-up peer education support to the radio programs; and (iii) build the \ncapacity of script writers, multimedia producers, and community mobilizers.  \n6.  UNESCO  will  coordinate  with  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  specialist  in \ndeveloping project performance indicators that will help monitor and evaluate radio dramas \namong the four ethnic minority groups. Indicators will be disaggregated by ethnic group and by \ngender where appropriate. \nb.  Pilot Broadcast Radio Dramas  \n7.  Pilot broadcast of radio dramas in low-resource settings will be implemented following \nthe terms of reference indicated in paras 1\u20136. Low-resource settings are defined as areas \nwhere established broadcasting infrastructure and entities in ethnic minority languages are \nunavailable. Ethnic minority groups in Ratanakiri (Cambodia) will be selected, in consultation \nwith  ADB  and  the  Government  of  Cambodia,  for  community-based  broadcasting.  A  rapid \nassessment  will  be  completed  to  help  identify  the  ethnic  minority  groups  for  piloting  in \n                                                 \n2  ADB, SEAMEO, UNESCO. 2004. HIV/AIDS in the GMS: Bulletin for Preventive Education in the Greater Mekong \nSubregion, Issue 1.  \n ", "Appendix 3  11\nRatanakiri. UNESCO will develop a radio program for the identified ethnic groups through \nresearch and participatory methods, and broadcast the program using a community-based \nsystem that could be transmitted via digital satellite broadcasting capacity.  \n8.  UNESCO  will  coordinate  with  other  ongoing  TAs  among  vulnerable  ethnic  minority \ngroups in Ratanakiri to ensure collaboration and avoid duplication of efforts. UNESCO will also \ncoordinate with the M&E specialist in developing project performance indicators that will help \nmonitor and evaluate the pilot radio drama in Cambodia. Socio-economic indicators will be \ndisaggregated by ethnic group and by gender, as appropriate. \n2.  Expansion of Information and Communication Technology Activities and \nNetworks: \na.  Clearinghouse on Preventive HIV/AIDS Education for the Mekong \nBorder Region \n9.  A clearinghouse facility, which is accessible via the Internet, was established under \nregional technical assistance (RETA) 6083.3 This clearinghouse has been updated with new \ninformation  and  updates  from  different  sources  since  the  completion  of  RETA  6083.  The \npurpose of the clearinghouse facility includes (i) improving access to lessons learned and best \npractices  as  well  as  innovative  information,  education  and  communication  (IEC)  materials \nproduced from HIV/AIDS education projects for ethnic minority groups, and hard-to-reach and \ndisadvantaged groups; (ii) reviewing, synthesizing, and repackaging information on HIV/AIDS \ninto accessible formats and information products for different population groups such as ethnic \nand linguistic minority groups, and hard-to-reach disadvantaged groups; and (iii) advocating and \npromoting the use of these various types of repackaged materials to disseminate knowledge, \nand effect attitudinal and behavioral change. \n10.  To achieve the clearinghouse objectives, the following will be undertaken:  \n(i)  Collect, process, disseminate, and share information and materials on HIV/AIDS \nfocusing on the needs of ethnic and linguistic minority groups, and hard-to-reach \nand disadvantaged groups. \n(ii)  Review,  synthesize,  and  repackage  information  into  accessible  forms  and \ninformation products tailored for segmented target groups. \n(iii)  Expand the existing database of IEC materials on HIV/AIDS and create a project \nweb site, with cross links to the data collected in RETA 6083 (footnote 3). \n(iv)  Promote and advocate the use of these materials.  \n \nb.  Geographic Information System (GIS)  \n11.  The purpose of GIS is to connect databases with information related to (i) HIV incidence, \ninterventions and coverage; and (ii) distribution of the population at risk. A successful GIS has \nthe potential to be an effective strategic planning and management tool for governments and \ndevelopment  partners  in  initiating  future  project  activities  through  the  inclusion  of  new \nepidemiological data and sharing of activity and organizational updates.  \n12.  The primary components of GIS include (i) incidence and sentinel surveillance data; (ii) \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2002.

Based on the GIS exercise conducted in Thailand (RETA 6083), GIS activities will be \nexpanded to cover the Lao PDR and Cambodia. A GIS exercise in the Lao PDR and Cambodia \nwill develop animated HIV/AIDS and vulnerability mappings for each country. The GIS exercise \nin the Lao PDR will be coordinated with the ethnographic databank at the Institute for Cultural \nResearch. \nc.  Network of Regional Universities and Research Institutions  \n14.  UNESCO  will  initiate  a  network  of  regional  universities  and  research  institutions  to \nupgrade the quality of sociocultural research on HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. This network \nwill help strengthen the quality of data collected at national and community levels for use in GIS \nexercises. UNESCO has budgeted two regional conferences in September 2005 on ethical \nstandards and research in trafficking and HIV/AIDS: (i) HIV/AIDS and Social Science Research; \nand (ii) Sociocultural Research on Human Trafficking (with the Asia Foundation).  \nd.  Project Management  \n15.  Through direct selection, ADB will recruit UNESCO for TA implementation. As provided \nfor in the existing agreement between UNESCO and ADB,4  UNESCO will be responsible for \nselecting, recruiting, and supervising the experts needed for implementing its components in the \nTA. The exception is the M&E specialist, who will be recruited as an individual and engaged \ndirectly by ADB. Using its standard procedures and those acceptable to ADB, UNESCO will \nselect and engage experts, based on the terms of reference provided in this appendix, from \namong qualified nationals of ADB\u2019s member countries. Prior to finalizing a contract with each \nexpert, UNESCO will seek ADB\u2019s no objection to the person proposed, and to the terms of \nreference under which that person will operate.  \n16.  All procurement financed by ADB under the Project will be in accordance with the local \ncompetitive bidding procedures of ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, and other arrangements \nacceptable to ADB. UNESCO will transfer all equipment to participating government counterpart \nagencies at the end of the TA. \n17.  TA implementation will begin in July 2005 and end in June 2007. A midterm review will \nbe conducted in June 2006. UNESCO will prepare quarterly progress reports, in a format to be \nagreed upon with ADB, and submit them to ADB within 1 month of the end of the period to \nwhich they refer. The reports due at midterm and the end of the TA will be replaced by more \ndetailed midterm and final reports respectively. A draft final report will be submitted to ADB for \ncomments, and finalized within 2 weeks after ADB\u2019s comments are received. \n                                                 \n4  The agreement for the implementation of ICT and HIV/AIDS Preventive Education in the Cross-Border Areas of the \nGreater Mekong Subregion (RETA 6083) between ADB and UNESCO, signed 28 March 2003. \n ", "Appendix 3  13\nB.
