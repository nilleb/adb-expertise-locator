THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The transaction TA facility will provide project preparation support to a series of ensuing \nprojects comprising (i) the Suva Port Development Project in Fiji, and (ii) the Rarotonga Airport \nInfrastructure Upgrade Project in Cook Islands. All ensuing projects are in the transport sector. \nThis TA is listed in the Regional Operations Business Plan for the Pacific in the period 2020-\n2022.1 \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s Pacific DMCs are scattered across 30 million km2 of ocean \u2013 or one-third of the \nEarth\u2019s surface \u2013 while their combined landmass represents less than 2% of this total. The Pacific \nDMCs, with the exception of Papua New Guinea, can be characterized as small, remote, and \nfragmented  island  groups  with  limited  resource  bases,  fairly  undiversified  economies,  and \ndependent on imports. Pacific DMCs face severe constraints caused by geography, infrastructure, \nclimate change impacts and increasingly frequent occurrences of disasters triggered by natural \nhazards. \n \n3.  The small size, isolation and high exposure to climate change and natural disasters of the \nPacific DMCs make them extremely vulnerable. Six of these countries are classified as fragile, \nand all countries in the region exhibit multiple vulnerabilities.2 These characteristics impede \nintegration with regional and global markets and economic development. A safer, more efficient, \nand reliable transport, connecting people with essential goods, services, and opportunities \u2013 such \nas food, education, health care, and jobs \u2013 develops and improves quality of life.  \n \n4.  The Pacific DMCs have made considerable progress toward increasing connectivity. \nHowever, there is still a pronounced need to increase connectivity across the region as a number \nof challenges remain to be addressed. Pacific DMCs need assistance to enhance transport \nconnectivity and resilience of their transport through (i) maritime links between regions, countries \nand populations; (ii) airports and runways to link countries and communities; and (iii) road \ninfrastructure and services to connect communities to key resources and economic opportunities. \nThe TA will provide support to identify and prepare projects and provide policy advice for strategic \nplanning with the aim of building strong, inclusive economies, while mitigating the key challenges \nthat are associated with the geographic isolation and limited resources. \n \n5.  The ensuing projects are aligned with the operational priorities of Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) Strategy 2030 of fostering regional cooperation and integration, by improving \ntransport infrastructure in main transport gateways (airports, ports); building climate and disaster \nresilience by designing and constructing resilient transport infrastructure; and promoting rural \ndevelopment, by connecting rural populations to the resources they need.3 The TA facility \nmodality enables more efficient TA management and greater flexibility in the range of solutions \nand support offered to Pacific DMCs under a single regional facility.  \n \n6.  Fiji. The country of Fiji is an archipelagic nation with 110 inhabited island and a land area \nof about 18,300 km2. Regionally, Fiji is one of the largest economies in the South Pacific and is \ncentrally located, making it a natural regional hub for trade. The Port of Suva is Fiji's largest \n \n1 ADB. 2019.

Fiji Ports \nCorporation Limited (FPCL) is the commercial port management company operating the port. \n \n7.  A condition assessment conducted in 2019 found that key infrastructure elements of the \nport are in a very advance state of deterioration requiring immediate upgrade or rehabilitation \nwithin 5 years to extend the service life. In 2018, the port served about 1,300 vessels, including \ncontainer vessels (108,092 TEU), cruise liners, and international fishing vessels. The port also \nacts as transshipment hub for the region, estimated at around 13% of total imports, or 7,054 TEU. \nThe FPCL throughput projections for 2025 are 132,000 TEU, with a 3.5% growth per year. \nHowever, the location of the port, next to the central market and bus station, limits the ability of \nthe port to expand and generates significant traffic congestion in the central business district of \nSuva. \n \n8.  Improvement of Fiji\u2019s seaports is required to continue serving as the major gateway for \npassengers and cargo connecting the country internationally and increasing transshipment. The \nrelocation of the port is a key priority for the Government of Fiji, which requested ADB\u2019s support \nto conduct strategic review of maritime operations to identify new sites to relocate the port or shift \nsome of the key operations to a new location. The study will review existing maritime policy and \nregulatory framework, assess the existing port condition and operation, and will identify and \nprioritize sites for potential port relocation. \n \n9.  Cook Islands. Cook Islands, located in the South Pacific Ocean, comprises 15 islands \nwith a total land area of 240 km2. The Rarotonga Airport is the country\u2019s only international airport \ngateway and is critical to the tourism industry which accounts for around 60% of the Gross \nDomestic Product. The annual growth rate of visitor arrivals is strong, averaging 6.4% in the last \n20 years (1989 -2018) from 48,600 to 168,800. The current airport facility is facing numerous \noperational challenges including capacity constraints, congestion, safety compliance, and limited \noptions for expansion and development of its passenger terminal\u2019s current location. \n \n10.  The runway pavement was built 46 years ago and is approaching the end of its useful life. \nDespite the efforts of the Airport Authority of the Cook Islands (AACI) to maintain the runway \ncondition, it is in deteriorating condition due to increased frequency of flights and the introduction \nof large aircrafts. In addition, the runway end safety area is too short and poses a risk and does \nnot meet the required International Civil Aviation Organization standards. During peak hours, \ncurrent demand for aircraft parking is higher than the existing capacity. Since the official opening \nof the terminal building in 1973, the terminal was expanded in 2006, further upgraded both the \narrival and departure areas in 2010. Despite the terminal expansions, the terminal is congested. \n \n11.  The Master Plan for Rarotonga international airport of the Airport Authority of the Cook \nIslands (the Master Plan) proposes airport development for the airside and landside for a 20-year \nperiod to 2040, with the intention to address compliance with prevailing standards, maintenance \nand repair requirements of critical infrastructure to meet the forecasted increasing demand. \n \n12.  The Government of the Cook Islands has requested ADB\u2019s support to identify, formulate, \nand prepare an investment project covering four key priority areas for improvements at Rarotonga \ninternational airport: (i) construction of runway end safety area in accordance with international \nsafety standards, (ii) repair of runway pavement, (iii) extension of aircraft apron area, and (iv) \nexpansion of passenger terminal building. The study will also update the Rarotonga International \nAirport master plan, assessing the performance, problems and opportunities in the air transport \nsubsector, and updating traffic forecast, reviewing current air infrastructure capacity. \n   \n ", "3 \nB.

The TA facility is estimated to cost $2.0 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 1. The governments of Fiji and Cook Islands will provide counterpart support in \nthe form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, and \n ", "4   \nother in-kind contributions. The governments were informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will administer the TA. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table \n2. \n \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  May 2020 \u2013 April 2025 \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agencies  MOE/FPCL, Fiji \nAACI, Cook Islands  \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nQCBS  Suva Port \u2013 Strategic Review of Development  $1.00 million \n(90:10)  Options in Fiji (30 person-months) \nQCBS  Rarotonga Airport Infrastructure Upgrade  $0.75 million \n(90:10)  Project in Cook Islands (28 person-months) \nICS  (5 person-months)  $0.25 million \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  Assets will be handed over to the respective government in each \narrangement upon TA  country upon TA completion. \ncompletion \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = Technical Assistance, QCBS = Quality and Cost Based Selection, ICS = \nIndividual Consultant Selection, MOE = Ministry of Economy, FPCL = Fiji Ports Corporation Limited, FRA = Fiji Roads \nAuthority, AACI = Airport Authority of the Cook Islands. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \n17.  Consulting services. ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated staff instructions.4 The TA will \nrequire the recruitment of two consulting firms, which will be selected and engaged by ADB using \nquality and cost-based selection (90:10). Selection of consultants commenced in February 2020 \nas an advance action in parallel to the TA processing. Mobilization of consultants is targeted for \nJuly 2020. \n \n18.  The TA will also require the recruitment of individual consultants to identify and prepare \ninvestment proposals in the countries covered by the TA. Individual consultants, international and \nnational,  with  expertise  in  transport  project  preparation  and  ADB\u2019s  due  diligence,  such  as \ntransport planning, roads and traffic engineering, maritime and air transport, economic and \nfinancial analysis, financial management, social and environment safeguards, or procurement will \nalso be required. The individuals will be selected by ADB using Individual Consultant Selection. \nInputs are indicative and may be realigned to the TA\u2019s requirements. \n \nE.  Governance \n \n19.  Since ADB is the executing agency, the financial management, procurement, and integrity \nrisks during TA implementation are assessed to be low. However, thorough risk assessments for \nfinancial management, procurement, and integrity for ensuing investment projects implemented \nin the target countries will be conducted under the TA. \n \n4  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "5 \n \nII.
