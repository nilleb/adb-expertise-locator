INTRODUCTION \n1.  At the request of the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), policy and \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening Technical and Vocational Education and \nTraining for Development of Priority Sectors in Shaanxi Province1 was included in the 2012 \nnonlending program of the Asian  Development  Bank (ADB)  in the PRC country operations \nbusiness plan, 2012\u20132014. ADB undertook TA reconnaissance2 in April 2011 and a consultation \nmission in November 2011. Agreement was reached with the government regarding the TA\u2019s \nimpact, outcome, outputs, costs and financing, implementation arrangements, and outline terms \nof reference for consulting services. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  PRC\u2019s  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015  outlines  development  goals  in  the \ncontext of a transition from export-oriented to domestic demand-driven growth. This transition, \ntaking  place  amid  the  country\u2019s  ongoing  urbanization  process,  has  generated  enormous \ndemand for skilled workers. To support this development, the government has prioritized the \ndevelopment of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) to help the country \ncultivate and maintain a competitive labor force. \n \n3.  Through continued investment, the PRC has developed a comprehensive TVET system, \nincluding a number of demonstration schools that are able to adjust to the demands of the \nmarket. However, the system faces several challenges in ensuring that TVET services keep \npace with the economic transformation. One major challenge is increasing the efficiency and \nresponsiveness of the TVET system. Unlike general education, TVET involves a wide range of \nstakeholders who provide policy directions to ensure that the demand for skills is satisfied. As \nthe PRC\u2019s economy continues to grow, the effectiveness of the TVET system will be measured \nby how well it boosts employability and work competency. To achieve this goal, the government \nis making efforts to strengthen the link between the labor market and TVET, including the \nemergence across the country of various partnership models between schools and enterprises. \nOne example of this is vocational education groups (VEGs), which comprise TVET schools and \nindustrial associations and enterprises in a specialized field. VEGs provide an institutionalized \nplatform to strengthen the link between the supply of and demand for skilled labor. \n \n4.  Shaanxi is one of the 12 less-developed provinces and autonomous regions supported \nby the government under its National Strategy for Development of the West. The provincial \neconomy has historically been dominated by agriculture, but under the National Strategy for \nDevelopment of the West, Shaanxi has rapidly industrialized and urbanized since the 1980s. At \nthe end of 2010, the provincial gross domestic product was about CNY1,002 billion, ranking \n14th among the provinces and autonomous regions in the PRC. Between the end of 1999 and \nthe end of 2010, the contribution to the provincial gross domestic product from the primary \nsector decreased from 18.0% to 9.7%, the contribution from the secondary sector increased \nfrom 43.1% to 51.9%, and the contribution from the tertiary sector dropped from 38.9% to 38.5%. \nThe  provincial  development  strategy  prioritizes  the  agriculture,  energy,  manufacturing,  and \nservice sectors to underpin the province\u2019s long-term development. Skills in these four sectors \nurgently need to be upgraded to support economic development under the Twelfth Five-Year \nPlan. Additionally, the use of high-technology, sophisticated business operations and complex \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 May 2012. \n2   Formerly  titled,  \u201cStrategies  for  Promoting  Shaanxi  Industry  and  Modern  Agriculture  Development  through \nVocational Training\u201d. At the request of the government during reconnaissance mission, the TA title was changed to \nappropriately reflect the project concept.  \n ", "2   \nmodern production systems require a high-quality workforce. Human resource development \nmust adapt and respond to the rapid changes that are taking place across business sectors.   \n \n5.  Since the early 1990s, Shaanxi has rapidly become urbanized as millions of migrant \nfarmers have moved to cities and towns to take nonagricultural jobs. At the end of 2010, the \nprovince had an urbanization level of 46.5%, compared with 26.84% in 1998. Urbanization in \nShaanxi is expected to reach 57% by the end of 2015, with the addition of about 6 million \npeople to the urban population between 2011 and 2015. Under the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, the \nprovince will need to produce an additional 740,000 highly skilled workers. \n \n6.  TVET services in Shaanxi are generally provided by multidisciplinary schools, which \nhave strong administrative links with different government agencies, including those inherited \nfrom the planned economy. In 2008, the Shaanxi provincial government introduced reforms by \nsetting up VEGs along specialized professional lines to consolidate TVET resources and to \nfoster demand-driven TVET service provision. Typical VEGs comprise schools that share the \nsame professional domain, similar enterprises, and similar industrial associations. VEGs have \ntwo basic functions: (i) bring together industries and TVET schools; and (ii) link less-developed \nTVET schools with well-established ones to consolidate TVET resources, with the goal of \nimproving the provision of services. With the support of the provincial government, Shaanxi is \npiloting  15  VEGs,  including  Yangling  modern  agriculture  VEGs,  Shaanxi  energy  VEGs,  a \nShaanxi manufacturing VEG, and a Shaanxi service sector VEG. \n \n7.  Although  provincial  regulations  supported  the  establishment  of  VEGs,  detailed \nguidelines  have  not  yet  been  developed.  As  a  result, the  activities  of  VEGs  are  currently \nconstrained and VEGs are being underutilized. The provincial government expects VEGs to \nplay an important role in bridging supply and demand in the labor market and strengthening \nlinks  between  developed  and  less-developed  schools  for  quality  improvement.  Developed \nschools  should  negotiate  the  development  of  innovative  school\u2013enterprise  partnerships  to \nrespond to enterprise labor demand, while less-developed schools could learn from developed \nschools and maximize the role of existing VEGs toward ensuring TVET improvement in Shaanxi \nProvince. \n \n8.  Through the TA, the government requests that ADB conduct an in-depth study on VEGs \nin Shaanxi\u2019s four priority sectors, and make suggestions on how these VEGs can be improved. \nThe TA will help the provincial government make recommendations to improve TVET services \nusing these newly strengthened VEGs to support the development of its priority sectors. The TA \nwill  also  provide  guidance  on  how  school\u2013enterprise  and  school\u2013school  partnerships  can \ndevelop and implement a demand-based curriculum based on labor market analysis supported \nby relevant provincial departments, including education, human resources, and social security. \nThe results of the TA will be shared with key stakeholders at the TA final workshop. The \nexperience of Shaanxi is expected to have a strong demonstration potential for other inland \nprovinces and autonomous regions that face similar development challenges as a result of \nongoing urbanization. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be a stronger and more competitive labor market in the priority \nsectors in Shaanxi Province. The outcome of the TA will be a comprehensive analysis of and \n ", "  3 \nrecommendations for how to strengthen VEGs, including the advancement of TVET school\u2013\nenterprise partnerships and TVET school\u2013school partnerships in the priority sectors. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will produce two outputs: (i) strategies and policy guidelines to improve VEGs, \nand (ii) development of a demand-driven curriculum for one subject in each of the four priority \nsectors, on a pilot basis. These will be achieved through (i) an analysis of the labor market, \nhuman  resources  needs,  and  the  skills  qualifications  framework  in  priority  sectors;  (ii)  an \nanalysis  of  current  VEGs  (school\u2013enterprise  and  school\u2013school  partnerships);  (iii) \nrecommendations on incentive mechanisms to promote the participation of enterprises in TVET \ndevelopment; (iv) suggestions to improve a labor projection model in the four priority sectors; (v) \nrecommendations to improve the skills qualifications framework; and (vi) development of the \ncurriculum framework, curriculum, and the implementation guidelines of one selected subject for \neach of the four priority sectors. The provincial government has key systems (e.g., qualifications \nframework) and tools (e.g., labor projection models) to conduct these activities. The TA will use \nexisting resources to produce outputs and prepare recommendations. The two outputs will be \npresented in the form of a TA technical report. In addition, a policy note that summarizes key \npolicy recommendations to improve VEGs will be prepared for policy makers. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The government has requested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).  \nThe government will provide counterpart support in the form of in-kind contributions, including \ncounterpart staff, a suitably furnished office with utilities and telecommunication access, and \nmaterials such as documents and data. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The Shaanxi Department of Finance (SDOF) will be the executing agency for the TA, \nand will be responsible for the overall execution and coordination of TA activities. SDOF has \nrich experience in implementing international projects, including ADB loan and TA projects. The \nShaanxi Department of Education (SDOE) will be the implementing agency. Under the guidance \nof SDOF, SDOE will be responsible for the day-to-day TA implementation. SDOE will work \nclosely with consultants to ensure that TA policy recommendations will be feasible for Shaanxi \nProvince. Under the supervision and guidance of SDOE, a project implementation office will be \nestablished  at  the  Provincial  Institute  of  Education  Science  to  provide  assistance  in \nimplementing TA activities. In addition, the provincial government will establish an interagency \nproject steering committee to provide overall guidance and support for TA implementation. The \nsteering  committee  will  be chaired by  a  deputy  governor  of  Shaanxi  Province.  Committee \nmembers  will  include  representatives  from  SDOF,  SDOE,  the  Shaanxi  Development  and \nReform Commission, the Shaanxi Department of Human Resources and Social Security, the \nShaanxi Department of Agriculture, and the Shaanxi Commission for Industry and Information \nTechnology. \n \n13.  TA  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). An advance payment facility \nwill  be  established  at  the  implementing  agency  for  expenses  on  workshops,  surveys, \ninternational study visits, and equipment. Procurement of equipment will be done in accordance \nwith  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Purchased \n ", "4   \nequipment will be turned over to the executing agency upon completion of the TA activities. The \ngovernment will provide an in-kind contribution to cover remuneration of counterpart staff, office \nspace, utilities, and in-city transportation in Xian. \n \n14.  The TA consultants will be engaged by ADB through a firm in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) and based on the \nquality of the proposal (90%) and the cost (10%) of the services to be provided (under the \nquality- and cost-based selection method), using a simplified technical proposal. The 90:10 \nweighting is considered appropriate because the TA is expected to have a strong impact on the \ndevelopment of future TVET policies in Shaanxi Province, and therefore requires high-quality \ntechnical  inputs.  The  TA  will  provide  a  total  of  35  person-months  of  consulting  services, \nincluding 4 person-months of international and 31 person-months of national consultant inputs. \nThe TA will be implemented over 12 months, from September 2012 to August 2013. The outline \nterms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. Major project activities will be regularly \nmonitored and reported to SDOF and ADB administrative missions. \n \nIV.
