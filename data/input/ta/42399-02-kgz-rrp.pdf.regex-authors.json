I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kyrgyz Republic for the CAREC Corridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road) Project 3.1 \n2.   The project road is located in the southeastern part of the country where poverty is \nwidespread. The main component of the project will facilitate more regional trade and higher \nmobility  for  the  local  people  by  improving  an  important  part  of  the  Central  Asia  Regional \nEconomic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Corridor  1.  The  other  component  will  increase  the \nsustainability of the national road network by staff training on infrastructure management.  \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.   The Kyrgyz Republic plays a crucial role in regional trade and transit traffic because its \nroads form part of the transport network in Central Asia. The condition of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s \nroad network and its management improved substantially from 2005 to 2010. However, several \ndilapidated network links and poor infrastructure management skills continue to hamper regional \ntrade  and  economic  growth.2 The  project  will  help  the  government  make  some  of  these \nimprovements in accordance with Strategy 2020 and of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).3 \nThe project fits within ADB\u2019s Country Partnership Strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic.4 \n4.   Aside from being landlocked, 80% of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s land is covered by the \nTian Shan mountain range. Trade and travel are almost entirely dependent on road transport. \nMore than 90% of the passenger trips and about 60% of the freight in 2009 was moved by \nroad.5 This has been made partly possible by development partner assistance since 1996 to \nupgrade about 2,000 kilometers (km) of strategic roads. More roads are waiting to be improved. \nThe 539 km Bishkek\u2013Torugart road is one of them. Its surface, most bridges, and safety devices \nare either inadequate or functionally obsolete. Traffic volumes in several sections exceed the \ncapacities, causing heavy delays during the summer months, and movement in some sections \nis frequently interrupted by landslides, snow drifts, waterlogging, and flooding. \n5.   The Bishkek\u2013Torugart road plays several important functions. It is part of the CAREC \nCorridor 1(c), which extends from Troitsk in the Russian Federation to Kashi in Xinjiang Uygur \nAutonomous Region of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC); it is the shortest thoroughfare \nfrom Bishkek to Kashi; and the only north\u2013south trunk road in the central Kyrgyz Republic, \nconnecting Naryn oblast (province), the poorest of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s seven oblasts, and the \ncity of Naryn to the rest of the country.6 It is also the only road that provides direct access at \npresent to Issyk Kul lake region, one of Central Asia\u2019s best known tourist destinations with huge \npotential to grow. However, the costly, slow, unreliable, and unsafe travel caused by the poor \nroad condition has hampered the development of the entire corridor, particularly Naryn oblast. \nImports from the PRC continue to grow, but exports are limited to a few products because only \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  These gaps are depicted in the problem tree (Figure 1) of the Sector Assessment (Summary): Roads (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n3  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n4  ADB. Joint Country Partnership Strategy 2007\u20132010. Manila. \n5  World Bank. 2009. National Road Rehabilitation (Osh\u2013Batken\u2013Isfana). Project Information Document. Report \nNo. AB4893. Washington, DC (August).  \n6  Corridor 1(c) connects to Corridor 2 and Corridor 5, which extend from Kabul (Afghanistan) to Hami (PRC). ", "2 \na few local communities are able to transport their produce to the consolidation centers such as \nNaryn and At Bashi. \n6.   Although the government prepared the Road Sector Development Strategy for 2007\u2013\n2010, in which the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road improvement features prominently as an action item, \nit lacked resources for implementing the strategy.7 As the country\u2019s first development partner \nand largest multilateral lender to the road sector, ADB was first to offer to meet part of the \nresource need. In 2008 and 2009, it financed the improvement of 114 km (km 365\u2013km 479) of \nthis road.8 It is also helping the government through CAREC to strengthen trade ties with its \nneighbors. The government of the PRC provided $200 million in 2010 to improve 223 km (from \nkm 9 to km 272).9 Works under these projects are progressing mostly on schedule, and are \nexpected to be completed by the end of 2014. The government is discussing with the Arab \nCoordination Group a financing package of $80 million for improving 93 km (km 272\u2013km 365).10 \nIf unimproved, the 60 km section from km 479 to km 539 at the Kyrgyz Republic\u2013PRC border \nwill be the only bottleneck in the corridor. \n7.   Infrastructure preservation is another task that the government has yet to accomplish \nefficiently. Between 1996 and 2010, total investment in road improvement exceeded $1 billion\u2014\nADB provided about $300 million of this. However, investment in preservation was about $28 \nmillion  in  2009,  six  times  more  than  in  2005;  only  half  of  what  was  needed  to keep  the \n19,000 km network under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transport and Communications \n(MOTC) in good shape. Cost recovery from road users covers only a fraction of the needs at \npresent,  and  the  government  is  facing  ever-rising  construction  and  maintenance  costs. \nTherefore, more attention must be paid to preservation. For this, the government not only needs \ntools\u2014legislation, policies, techniques, and procedures\u2014but also skilled staff to use the tool \nand to champion change. \n8.   The project will help the government improve the 60 km section from At Beit to Torugart \nat the PRC border, the last segment of the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road. Together with the ongoing \nimprovement works in the other sections, it will enable all-weather road travel from Bishkek to \nKashi.  Aside  from  the  economic  benefits  of  higher  speeds  and  reliability,  the  better  road \ngeometry and protective structures resulting from the improvement will reduce the accidental \ntoxic spill risk and material runoff from vehicles. These reductions will benefit the ecosystem of \nChatyr Kul Lake\u2014a wetland of international significance that is protected under the Ramsar \nConvention on Wetlands. \n                                                \n7 Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, Ministry of Transport and Communications. 2007.

Report and Recommendation of \nthe President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Asian Development Fund Grant to the Kyrgyz Republic \nfor the CAREC Transport Corridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road) Project 2. Manila (Loan 2533-KGZ, for $28 million, \nand Grant 0153-KGZ, for $22 million approved on 14 July). The section from km 400 to km 439 (Torugart at the \nPRC border) is being improved under the CAREC Corridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road) Project (Grant 0123-KGZ) \nand the sections from km 439 to km 479 and from km 365 to km 400 are being improved under the CAREC \nCorridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road) Project 2 (Grant 0153/ Loan 2533). These two projects also have components \nfor improving border control facilities at Torugart, formulating a transport sector masterplan, and establishing a \nBishkek\u2013Torugart road corridor management department. \n9  Chainage starts (km 0) at the Bishkek end of the road. \n10 Arab  Coordination  Group  is  comprised  of  the  Saudi  Development  Fund,  Kuwait  Fund  for  Arab  Economic \nDevelopment, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development. \n ", "3 \n9.   The project will also strengthen the infrastructure management skills of government staff \nengaged  in  the  road  sector.  This  is  an  essential  and  natural  complement  to  the  capital \ninvestment.  ADB  provided  technical  assistance  for  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity \nbuilding totaling nearly $6 million from 1996 to 2010. The World Bank and the European Bank \nfor Reconstruction and Development have further assistance programmed for 2011. These are \nshort and one-off interventions. The project, in contrast, supports a long-term, results-oriented \nprogram of learning and development for government staff. It will result in better informed staff, \nequipped to champion strategies for reducing lifecycle costs and improving user cost recovery.11 \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.   The project\u2019s impact will be increased regional trade, particularly between the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and the PRC. Its outcome will be higher mobility for people and goods with origins and \ndestinations in the road corridor between Naryn and Torugart.12 The project complements and \nutilizes the synergy created by road sector investments by other development partners.13 \nC.  Outputs \n11.   The project\u2019s primary output will be 60 km of two-lane Bishkek\u2013Torugart road (km 479\u2013\nkm 539) repaired, rehabilitated, or reconstructed to national Category III road standards with \nspecial structures for protecting the environment, preserving the road structure, and reducing \nvehicle crashes. This will be delivered through the civil works component. The other output will \nbe improved infrastructure management skills of MOTC and other government agency staff. \nThis will be achieved through training, education, and mentoring from national and international \nconsultants. \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n12.   The project is estimated to cost $70 million equivalent.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR35,041,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan will \nhave a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan agreement. The government will finance the balance of the project \ncost, mainly in the form of taxes and import duties, and resources to cover the contingencies. \nThe financing plan is in Table 2. \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)    (%) \nAsian Development Bank  55.00    79 \nGovernment  15.00    21 \n  Total    70.00    100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.   MOTC  will  be  the  executing  agency.  It  has  implemented  all  development  partner \nfinanced  road  projects  since  1995,  and  has  accumulated  considerable  experience.  The \ninvestment project implementation group (IPIG) in MOTC will be responsible for day-to-day \nadministration of project activities. The IPIG was established in 1996, and has since delivered \nmore than 12 road projects valued at nearly $500 million. The IPIG has 29 full-time staff, and is \nimplementing 13 projects with an estimated total value of  $520 million. Its project delivery \nperformance in terms of timeliness and final cost to date has been satisfactory, and staff has \nadequate technical know-how and understanding of ADB procedures to manage the project. \nThere are provisions in the project to enhance delivery performance in terms of timeliness and \nbudget  adherence.  MOTC  will  engage  consultants,  financed  from  the  loan,  as  and  when \nneeded,  to  assist  its  staff  with  complex  issues,  especially  those  related  to  environmental \nmanagement and ecosystem preservation. It will also engage consultants to improve staff skills \non project delivery. \n15.   MOTC will procure civil works and consulting services for civil works supervision from \nfirms  with  global  experience  and  proven  records  of  efficient  delivery.  The  implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project administration \nmanual (PAM).14 \n                                                \n14 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  1 January 2011\u201330 September 2015 \nEstimated completion date  30 September 2015 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Ministry of Finance \nM.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n16.   MOTC has prepared detailed design drawings, specifications, and bills of quantities for \nthe civil works. These would normally be adequate for an admeasurement contract (based on \nbills of quantities). However, the project site conditions are unique. Its elevation is more than \n3,000 meters, the ground there is permanently frozen, and the road alignment is close to a \nunique  wetland.  Therefore,  the  current  design  will  require  numerous  changes  during \nconstruction. Accordingly, MOTC will procure the civil works using the design-build project \ndelivery method according to specifications detailed in ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents. This \nmethod allows (i) MOTC to share the cost, delay, and the risk of design changes with the \ncontractor; and (ii) the contractor to use technology and construction methods more economical \nand relevant to the site. Past data suggests that the initial price of design-build contracts is 5%\u2013\n10% higher than admeasurement method contracts, but the final price of design-build contracts \nis often less. Moreover, under a design-build contract, MOTC and the construction supervision \nconsultant can focus more on output quality, which is critical at this site. \n ", "6 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n17.   The benefit of the project is dependent on the improvement of the entire Bishkek\u2013\nTorugart road, which provides both national and international access to the people and goods \nwithin and outside the corridor. Improvement of the entire Bishkek\u2013Torugart road will bring \nabout significant regional benefits, because it helps increase trade, particularly between the \nKyrgyz Republic and the PRC. MOTC and ADB have found the economic benefits of the \ninvestment in the road to be robust and sustainable. The economic internal rate of return on the \ninvestment is about 34%, assuming that all other sections of the road are improved by the end \nof 2015.15  \n18.   The government recognizes that the increasing number of heavy vehicles and their axle \nloads are reducing the service life of many roads, and that this trend has to be reversed for \npreserving the newly created assets. Besides continuing to increase the maintenance budget, it \nis implementing axle load limits on roads according to the design standards. However, if loads \nexceed the limit, under the present scheme, the vehicles are charged a fee and allowed on the \nroad. The government will, therefore, revise the fees and tolls to reflect the level of use and \nvehicle type, and ban vehicles with axle loads in excess of limit. \nC.  Governance \n19.   MOTC has been following ADB\u2019s safeguards, procurement and financial management \nguidelines, policies, and procedures for implementing road projects since 1996, and its staff is \nknowledgeable  about  ADB\u2019s  requirements.  Project  accounts  will  be  audited  annually  by  a \nprivate audit firm acceptable to ADB. Past audit reports on ADB projects have not highlighted \nany irregularities. MOTC will conduct periodic technical audits of the work of the supervision \nconsultant and contractor as part of its increased oversight of works, services, and goods \ncontracts. MOTC will also train its staff under the skills development component of the project, \nand introduce internal financial audits and technical audits.16 \n20.   ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Ministry of Finance and MOTC. IPIG staff responsible for procurement and contract \nadministration  is  aware  of  and  understand  the  requirements.  The  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures that must be included in all contracts are described in the PAM. \nD.  Poverty and Social \n21.   When viewed in the context of the entire Bishkek\u2013Torugart road, the project will bring \nsignificant benefits to both the people of Naryn oblast and the Kyrgyz Republic as a whole, and \nwill also have positive impacts on poverty reduction in the PRC. The 30% reduction in trip times \nand vehicle operating costs from Torugart to Naryn will increase activity at the freight transit \ncenter in Naryn city. This will create more jobs and increase the demand for local services.17 \nPeople residing along the road will be able to find employment in physical works and ancillary \nservices during construction. The increase in traffic will help sustain the service businesses that \npeople started during construction. Civil works and service contracts financed  by ADB will \nrequire equal employment opportunities, wages, and relevant working conditions to be given to \nwomen. The government has gradually increased border and internal security monitoring, and \n                                                \n15 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Details are in Section V of the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2) \n17 Country Economic Indicators and Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nwill implement a national road safety awareness program in the local communities. These \nmeasures will help prevent possible negative social effects such as traffic accidents, human and \ndrug trafficking, and spread of sexually transmitted infections, which may result from increased \ntravel and trade.    \nE.  Safeguards \n22.   The project is classified as environmental category A, because about 35 km of the road \npasses in close proximity to Chatyr Kul Lake protected area. ADB assisted the government in \nconducting an environmental impact assessment (EIA), which shows that (i) the impacts during \nconstruction  are  mostly  acute,  temporary,  and  reversible,  with  the  exception  of  possible \nhazardous materials spills; (ii) potential impacts during operations are expected to be much \ngreater as the road has a design lifetime of 20+ years, and pollutants entering the Chatyr Kul \naquatic ecosystem could accumulate because the lake has no outlet; (iii) some improvements in \ndust, noise, and vibration are expected; and (iv) long-term impacts caused by increased traffic, \nvehicle emissions, and possible hazardous materials spills pose potential risks to the Chatyr Kul \necosystem. \n23.   The draft EIA report was discussed with the stakeholders and disclosed to the public in \nNovember 2010.18 The report contains a two-track environmental management plan (EMP) for \n(i) pollutant source control, and (ii) receptor (biodiversity) protection. The control and protection \nmeasures include speed limits, signs, and special permits for hazardous material movement, \nand  hydraulic  structures  such  as  retention  pods  and  diversion  channels  to  prevent  runoff \npollutants and accidentally spilled toxic substances from entering the wetlands.  \n24.   ADB and the government have agreed that MOTC will \n(i)  survey the ecosystem, establish baseline indicators, update the EIA report, and \nobtain ADB\u2019s approval before handing over the civil works site to the contractor;   \n(ii)  select a contractor and an engineer for civil works only if they have proven work \nexperience in highly environmentally sensitive areas and international standards \norganization certification; \n(iii)  include  particular  conditions  in  their  contracts  outlining  penalties  for \nnoncompliance with the EMP; \n(iv)  engage qualified and experienced external experts or qualified nongovernment \norganizations under a selection process and terms of reference acceptable to \nADB, to verify information produced through the project monitoring process, and \nfacilitate the carrying out of any verification activities by such external experts; \n(v)  promptly inform ADB of the occurrence of any risks or impacts, with detailed \ndescription of the event and proposed corrective action plan if any unanticipated \nenvironmental  and/or  social  risks  and  impacts  arise  during  construction, \nimplementation, or operation of the project that were not considered in the EIA \nand the EMP; \n(vi)  report  any  actual  or  potential  breach  of  compliance  with  the  measures  and \nrequirements set forth in the EMP promptly after becoming aware of the breach; \nand \n(vii)  submit at least semiannual monitoring reports during project construction, and at \nleast annual reports during operation. \n \n                                                \n18 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n25.   The project does not require land acquisition or involuntary resettlement, as all civil \nworks will take place within the existing right-of-way. There are no indigenous peoples in the \nproject area.  Accordingly, the project is classified as resettlement category C and indigenous \npeoples category C. If there is a need during project implementation, for acquisition of land, \nresettlement of people, or any impact of indigenous peoples, MOTC will consult with ADB and \nprepare  plans  for  addressing  the  issues  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguards  Policy  Statement \n(2009). \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n26.
