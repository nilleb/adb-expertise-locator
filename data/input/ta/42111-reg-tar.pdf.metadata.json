INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Program1 emphasizes \npragmatism and results. The long-term vision is of \u201cGood Neighbors, Good Partners, and Good \nProspects.\u201d The 5th Ministerial Conference, held 18\u201320 October 2006 in Urumqi, the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), adopted the Urumqi Declaration and endorsed the comprehensive \naction  plan  (CAP).  The  declaration  reaffirms  each  country\u2019s  commitment  to  development \nthrough cooperation leading to accelerated economic growth and poverty reduction, and to be \nconsistent with the CAP in a manner that avoids duplication and maximizes the efficient use of \nresources. The CAP2 provides strategic direction to the CAREC Program for the medium to long \nterm, setting out the goals, objectives, and expected outputs and outcomes in a results-based \nformat. The CAP knowledge and capacity building pillar proposes the formation of the CAREC \nInstitute to coordinate research, training and dialogue activities for the CAREC Program. The \nmission of the CAREC Institute, a virtual institute supported by the CAREC Secretariat, is to \nenhance the quality of regional cooperation by generating world-class knowledge resources to \nsupport regional infrastructure networks in the priority areas of transportation, trade, and energy, \nwhich will lead to greater capacities for regional cooperation and accelerated economic growth \nin Central Asia. The institute\u2019s prospectus was endorsed at the 6th Ministerial Conference, held \n2\u20133 November 2007, in Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  \n \n2.  Considerable capacity-building and initial research activities have been undertaken by \nthe CAREC Program.3 The CAREC Institute provides the foundations for a more coordinated \napproach to the design and implementation of learning activities, and the harnessing of local \nknowledge and research capabilities with the support of the six CAREC participating multilateral \ninstitutions. The Greater Mekong Subregion Phnom Penh Plan for development management \nhas been studied and the institute will build on the lessons learned. The design and monitoring \nframework is shown in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The  CAREC  participating  countries  face  a  large  number  of  interrelated  issues  and \nconstraints based in part on their history and their location in Asia, a situation that provides both \nopportunities  and  challenges.  To  succeed  in  this  environment,  the  CAREC  participating \ncountries are reorienting their economies, consolidating their relationships with trading partners, \nand improving the legal and regulatory frameworks and systems to support private sector \ninvestment. Regional cooperation and integration provide a framework for economic dialogue \nbetween  the  countries,  and  an  opportunity  to  allocate  scarce  resources,  including  human \ncapacity, to the sectors and areas where most value can be created. CAREC participating \ncountries  face  many  capacity  challenges.  A  central  feature  of  the  CAREC  Program  is  to \n                                                 \n1  Eight  countries  participate  in  the  CAREC  Program:  Afghanistan,  Azerbaijan,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China, \nKazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. They are joined by six multilateral institutions: \nADB, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, International Monetary Fund, Islamic Development \nBank, United Nations Development Programme, and World Bank. \n2  The CAP has four action pillars to achieve development through cooperation and aims to strengthen other \nprinciples such as ownership by the CAREC participating countries and partnership with the business community \nand regional organizations. The action pillars are (i) knowledge and capacity building; (ii) regional infrastructure \nnetworks; (iii) trade, investment, and business development; and (iv) regional public goods. \n3  Supported by ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation: Capacity \nDevelopment for Regional Cooperation in CAREC Participating Countries, Phase I. Manila (TA 6375); ADB. 2007. \nTechnical Assistance for Strengthening Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation, 2007\u20132009. Manila (TA \n6409).  \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 May 2008. \n ", "2   \nupgrade the skills and knowledge of public sector officials involved in regional cooperation work. \nThe  capacity  challenges  can  be  classified  into  two  broad  categories:  (i)  human  resource \nchallenges, and (ii) institutional challenges. The human resource challenges are the shortage of \nskilled labor needed to complete each country's transition to a market economy and to promote \nregional cooperation. These challenges relate to the change in mind-set needed to support a \nmore client-oriented approach to public service delivery. The institutional capacity challenges \nrelate to the need for well-equipped administrative and bureaucratic structures to undertake, \nconsolidate, and sustain reforms. \n \n4.  There  is  considerable  scope  for  sharing  curriculum  and  training  programs  across \ncountries, and bringing in expertise from outside of the region. The CAREC Program\u2019s capacity-\nbuilding activities have demonstrated some success in sharing technologies from the PRC \npublic service with other CAREC participating countries. Stronger linkages need to be formed \namong the research and training institutions within the region. Training and research networks \nexist in CAREC participating countries, and it is proposed that this TA be used to strengthen \nsuch networks to focus on regional cooperation in the priority sectors of transport, energy, and \ntrade. Proposed activities will improve the enabling environment for private sector investment \nand industrial development, and address issues surrounding regional public goods. \n  \n5.  In mid-2007, the CAREC Secretariat assessed participating countries' training needs to \nbetter understand requirements in relation to regional cooperation and to identify specific course \nofferings  as  part  of  a  larger  capacity  development  program.  To  establish  the  demand  for \ncourses, a two-step process was designed, including (i) a survey questionnaire, and (ii) in-\ncountry workshops held for over 100 potential participants for building capacity in five CAREC \nparticipating countries. The training assessment established a positive demand for training \namong  senior  and  mid-level  officials.  Senior  officials  were  unanimous  in  their  request  for \ncourses  that  would  provide  macrolevel  perspective,  strategic  vision  and  wide-ranging \nknowledge. Demand is strong for courses in leadership, negotiations for regional agreements, \npublic policy, and public sector reform. Mid-level officials highlighted the need for specialized \nskills and technical knowledge in the discharge of their responsibilities. \n \n6.    Capacity-building initiatives to strengthen participants\u2019 knowledge and skills for regional \ncooperation activities are needed. The enhanced knowledge and skills will in turn lead to more \neffective development policies and a greater number of regional projects and initiatives from the \nCAREC countries. Knowledge-sharing activities will not be limited to government officials, but \nwill also cover the private sector, such as business associations, chambers of commerce, and \norganizations of freight forwarders. Research activities will generate expert information and \nanalysis that other researchers, government officials, and policy makers can use in planning \nand  implementing  regional  activities.  Shared  knowledge  from  joint  research,  training,  and \ndialogue channels is expected to result in a greater convergence of participating countries\u2019 \neconomic development policies in areas covered by regional cooperation and will be based on \nbest practice. These activities should also contribute to the emergence or strengthening of \n\u201cpolicy  communities\u201d  of  researchers,  academic  institutions,  policy  makers,  and  other \nstakeholders  to  facilitate  dialogue and  enhance  the impact  of  applied  research and  policy \nstudies in CAREC\u2019s priority areas. \n \n7.  The  CAREC  Institute  has  been  established  as  a  virtual  institute  supported  by  the \nCAREC Secretariat and the contributing multilateral institution partners. As such, the institute \n ", "    3\nwill not have any permanent location, infrastructure, or staff.5  In this regard, the sustainability of \nthe institute is a key issue over the longer term. In the short term, cofinancing from ADB and \ndevelopment partners will be able to sufficiently support the institute\u2019s undertakings. Over the \nlonger term and with further economic development of the CAREC participating countries, it is \nexpected that the countries themselves would be able to cover an increasing share of the \nCAREC Institute costs.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the technical assistance (TA) is closer regional cooperation among the \nCAREC participating countries. The outcome is the effective functioning of the CAREC Institute \nin delivering training, research, and dialogue activities. The enhanced knowledge and skills of \nCAREC  government  officials  and  other  stakeholders  will,  in  turn,  lead  to  more  rapid \nidentification and development of regional projects in CAREC priority areas, a greater number of \nregional proposals and activities initiated by CAREC countries, and more effective regional \ncooperation. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The CAREC Institute\u2019s main outputs are (i) a capacity building training program to \nimprove knowledge and skills of government officials in areas related to regional cooperation; (ii) \nan applied research program, to generate new knowledge, innovation, and recommendations \nthat will support more effective regional cooperation; and (iii) an outreach program, to extend \nthe impact of the institute\u2019s training and research more broadly. Partnerships and collaboration \nwith institutes, experts, and researchers from the CAREC countries will be a central element of \nthe institute's work in each of these areas. The institute will regularly report on its activities to \nsenior  officials\u2019  meetings  and  will  prepare  a  progress  report  on  its  activities  and  resource \nutilization to be submitted annually to the ministerial conference. This TA will be sufficiently \nflexible to accommodate the evolving nature of the CAREC Program.  \n \n10.  The institute's training program will operate with a number of partners, including (i) other \ninstitutes or capacity-building networks, (ii) advanced training institutions, (iii) beneficiary training \ninstitutions, and (iv) multilateral institutions. The program will address the needs identified in the \ntraining needs assessment at two levels. An executive leadership development program (ELDP) \nwill be developed and offered in collaboration with a leading international university or business \nschool to meet the identified needs of senior officials for courses in leadership, negotiation for \nregional agreements, public policy and public sector reform. Elements of the leadership course, \ncombined with support for the active training programs of the CAREC sector committees for \ntransport, trade facilitation, energy, and trade policy, will meet the identified needs of mid-level \nofficials for specialized skills and technical knowledge. \n \n11.  The institute's research program will also operate with a number of partners, including (i) \nother research networks, (ii) research institutions in CAREC countries, (iii) CAREC's multilateral \ninstitution  partners,  (iv)  leading  research  institutions  outside  CAREC  countries,  and  (v) \nrenowned individual experts. Research will support the development of a sound knowledge \nbase in the CAREC priority areas. This will include projects to (i) analyze the impact of regional \n                                                 \n5  This approach offers substantial advantages by making use of existing resources and minimizing fixed investment \ncosts before the institute demonstrates tangible benefits.  \n ", "4   \ncooperation, (ii) explore opportunities for structural transformation of the CAREC participating \neconomies, and (iii) examine regional approaches to addressing the challenges of landlocked \neconomies and dependence on natural resources in the Central Asian context. In addition to \nlarger  research  projects,  a  competitive  research  grants  component  will  be  implemented  to \npromote research on regional cooperation undertaken by experts from CAREC countries.6 In \naddition, a few small grants not exceeding a total of $40,000 in any given year, may also be \nnegotiated directly with selected research institutes to build local capacity for policy analysis.   \n \n12.  An indicative set of activities for the training and research programs is presented in \nAppendix 2. \n \n13.  The institute's outreach program will enable information generated through the training \nand research programs to be shared with parties in the broader development community, the \nprivate sector, and other relevant stakeholders in the CAREC process. A key element of the \noutreach program will be the development of an information portal to provide all interested \nparties access to available training materials, research outputs, and information of relevance to \nthe work of the CAREC Program that has been developed by CAREC partners and others. In \naddition, the institute will foster dialogue and debate on relevant regional issues through the \ndevelopment and sponsorship of publications, conferences, seminars, and other information \ndissemination activities. \n \n14.  During its initial stage, the CAREC Institute will be closely linked with the CAREC \nSecretariat  for  technical  and  administrative  support,  and  to  facilitate  coordination  between \nCAREC priority agendas and the institute\u2019s activities.  \n \n15.  A performance review of the institute is planned for 2010. The review will assess the \ninstitute's achievements, challenges and constraints. It will examine approaches to building on \nareas of success and to identifying practical responses to challenges and constraints that will \ncontribute to improved efficiency of and stronger support for the broader work of the CAREC \nProgram.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $5.2 million. ADB will finance $4.0 million of this amount \nfrom its TA special fund and $0.5 million from the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund \nunder the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility. ADB will also \nadminister the balance of $0.5 million cofinanced from the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional \nCooperation  and  Poverty  Reduction  Fund.  The  participating  governments  will  provide  the \nremaining $0.2 million, which is the estimated value of logistical support for meetings and staff \ntime for activities. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. Over time, additional support \nin funding or in kind will be sought from the CAREC participating governments and development \npartners to finance an expanded program of training, research, and outreach activities.  \n \n                                                 \n6  The small grants program was developed under ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation: Capacity Development for Regional Cooperation in CAREC Participating Countries, Phase \nI. Manila (TA 6375). The extension of the program under this TA will build on the administrative procedures that \nhave already been developed under TA 6375. \n ", "    5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 39 months from 1 January 2009 to 31 March 2012.7 \nADB will be the Executing Agency, and ADB\u2019s CAREC Unit in the Country Coordination and \nRegional Cooperation Division of the Central and West Asia Department will be responsible for \noverall implementation of TA activities. The CAREC Unit, acting as the Implementing Agency, \nwill be responsible for day-to-day implementation activities. The CAREC Unit will maintain close \ncoordination with the East Asia Department, particularly the Regional Cooperation, Governance, \nand  Finance  Division.  For  implementing  the  TA,  about  34  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services and 138 person-months of national consulting services will be engaged. \nADB will engage consultants through the quality- and cost-based selection process to develop \nand  implement  the  ELDP.8 ADB  will  also  engage  consultants  on  an  individual  basis  in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Resource persons for about 20 assignments will be engaged to support the development \nand delivery of training and capacity-building activities. The terms of reference for consultants \nare in Appendix 4. Equipment budgeted under the TA consists of a limited number of computers \nand office equipment that will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time) and left with the CAREC Unit upon completion of the TA. \n \n18.  The outputs of the TA will be disseminated at CAREC senior officials' meetings and \nministerial  conferences,  and  through  the  CAREC  Institute  portal,  outreach  events,  and \npublications. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n19.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $4,500,000 on a grant basis for the Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation Institute, 2009\u20132012. If the Board approves ADB providing the technical \nassistance, the President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, will approve ADB \nadministering the balance of the technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 \nto be financed on a grant basis by the People's Republic of China Regional Cooperation and \nPoverty Reduction Fund for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Institute, 2009\u2013\n2012.\n                                                 \n7  ADB will obtain a separate no-objection letter from the CAREC participating countries before the TA undertakes \nany activities. \n8  A  leading  university  or  business  school  with  significant  experience  in  customized,  multi-cultural  executive \neducation, including delivery of multi-language, multi-country programs, will be engaged to develop and deliver the \nELDP. Given the limited number of institutions meeting these requirements it is anticipated the shortlist of potential \nproviders will number three to four institutions. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \n  DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions and Risks \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms    \nImpact      Assumptions \nCloser economic  Average GDP growth in  ADB growth statistics for  \u2022 Participating countries in \ncooperation among   CAREC countries in  CAREC countries  the CAREC Program \nCAREC Program  2010\u20132014 of about 10%    continue engagement   \nparticipating countries  (compared with base of  ADB poverty statistics for  and commitment to \n  9.7% in 2002\u20132006)  CAREC countries  greater regional \n    economic cooperation. \nA 10% reduction in  \u2022 The regional technical \npoverty incidencea  assistance for \n  strengthening CARECb \nis successfully \nimplemented.  \n\u2022 Macroeconomic and \npolitical stability prevails \nin CAREC countries. \nOutcome      Assumptions \nEnhanced capacity of  CAREC Institute products  CAREC Institute portal  \u2022 CAREC senior officials \nCAREC government  supporting the CAREC    endorse the CAREC \nofficials and development  Program by filling the  Reports of senior officials  Institute work program \ninstitutions to support  knowledge gap,  resulting  meetings and ministerial  and budget. \nregional economic  in better strategy  conference  \u2022 CAREC governments \ncooperation through better  development and project    cooperate with the \npolicy formulation and  implementation  Annual reports of the  CAREC Institute and its \nimplementation    activities of the CAREC  activities. \nImprovements in the  Institute  \u2022 Partnership \ninstitutional capacities of    arrangements ensure \nselected CAREC-based  Studies, research reports  technology transfer and \neducation and training    knowledge-sharing. \ninstitutions    \n \nKey stakeholders \nengaged in discussion on \nresearch outputs, \nresearch networks \nstrengthened \nOutputs     Annual reports of the  Assumptions \n1.
