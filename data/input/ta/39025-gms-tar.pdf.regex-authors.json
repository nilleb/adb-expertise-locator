Recognizing  the  environmental  challenges  to  sustainable  economic  growth  and \ndevelopment  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS),  the  GMS  Working  Group  on \nEnvironment (WGE)1 in September 2004 requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for a \nCore Environment Program (CEP) to address the likely stresses on the environment from \neconomic development in the GMS, particularly in its economic corridors. The regional technical \nassistance (RETA) for the GMS Biodiversity Conservation Corridors Initiative,2 provided by ADB \nin December 2004 in response to that request, (i) prepared a strategic framework and action \nplan  (2005\u20132014)  for  the  GMS  biodiversity  conservation  corridors,  and  (ii) facilitated  the \npreparation of the CEP for the consideration of GMS environment ministers and summit leaders. \n \n2.  The  GMS  environment  ministers\u2019  meeting  in  Shanghai,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China \n(PRC), in May 2005 and the second GMS summit in Kunming, PRC, in July 2005 endorsed the \nimplementation of the CEP and its flagship component, the Biodiversity Conservation Corridors \nInitiative  (BCI).  The  GMS  environment  ministers  also  endorsed  the  establishment  of  the \nEnvironment Operations Center (EOC) in Bangkok, Thailand, to provide operating capacity to \nthe WGE and to implement the CEP and BCI. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program3 (RCSP) for 2004\u20132008 of ADB aims \nto  assist  the  GMS  countries  in  implementing  the  GMS  Strategic  Development  Framework \n(SDF)4 by strengthening connectivity and competitiveness, and developing a greater sense of \ncommunity, in the region. The regional economic corridors are expected to play a crucial role in \ndelivering the development agenda of the RCSP. The sustainability and competitiveness of the \nGMS member countries and the performance of the economic corridors will depend, to a large \nextent, on the efficiency and effectiveness with which the region\u2019s natural resource endowments \nare protected and maintained. \n \n4.  RCSP implementation, and the resulting economic transformation in the GMS, brings \nwith it inevitable transformations in the natural environment. These include the decline and \ndegradation  of  natural  resource  endowments,  and  associated  environmental  changes  with \nimplications for productivity and return on investments in the main development sectors. Some \ntrends showing the dependence of sector productivity on the condition of linked natural systems \nin the GMS are the following: \n(i)  Forestry \u2013 increasing forest product demand with increasing cost of production \nand 50% decline in resource base. \n(ii)  Fisheries \u2013 increasing effort but decreasing catch per unit effort (due to the \ndecline of stocks in coastal and freshwater systems). \n                                                 \n1\n The WGE was established in 1995 to help mainstream environmental considerations in the GMS Economic \nCooperation Program. Each GMS country is represented by two officials from the environment or natural resource \nmanagement agency. The secretariat and program support functions for the WGE have been provided by ADB \nfrom Manila, assisted as necessary by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) from Bangkok.  \n2  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance for the Greater Mekong Subregion Biodiversity Conservation Corridors Initiative. \nManila (TA 6213-REG, for $400,000, approved on 17 December 2004). \n3  ADB. 2004. Greater Mekong Subregion Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program (2004-2008). Manila. \n4  The GMS countries adopted an SDF in 2001 to guide the next 10 years of development cooperation. The SDF \nfocuses on five areas: (i) infrastructure, (ii) cross-border trade and investment, (iii) private sector participation, \n(iv) human resource development, and (v) environmental protection. \n ", "2   \n \n(iii)  Hydropower  \u2013  increasing  demand  and  investment  in  electricity  supply,  and \nincreasing real cost per unit of energy (due to a failure to fully account for \nwatershed maintenance and other environmental services). \n(iv)  Agriculture \u2013 increasing production costs (due to soil loss, chemical inputs, and \nfluctuation in water supply). \n(v)  Industry \u2013 increasing cost of water supply and treatment (due to reduced water \nquality and access). \n(vi)  Nature-based tourism \u2013 rapidly increasing demand and investment, leading to \ndiminishing quality of \u201cproducts.\u201d   \n \n5.  There is therefore concern that the degradation of the natural systems will accelerate \nwithout  a  systematic  environmental  assessment  and  management  of  the  development \nstrategies, plans, and investments in the GMS economic corridors. Environmental degradation \nwill directly and indirectly undermine the functioning of the ecosystems in the subregion, and \nthereby threaten its long-term socioeconomic and environmental security. \n \n6.  Current  response  strategies,  such  as  the  establishment  of  protected  areas,  are \ninsufficient to address these issues of ecosystem decline and economic inefficiencies. Because \nthe protected areas are small, these are increasingly being reduced to islands within a cultivated \nand fragmented landscape and subjected to development pressure. Consequently, protected \nareas are unlikely to safeguard high-value ecosystem services like biodiversity conservation and \nwatershed  protection.  The  protected-area  options  in  the  GMS  for  addressing  ecosystem \nfragmentation will become more limited as attempts to enlarge protected areas collide with \npressures on land for other uses. More and more, ecosystem fragmentation is being associated \nwith  development  activities,  including  the  development  of  GMS  transport  and  economic \ncorridors, which are also likely to affect biodiversity. \n \n7.  In response, GMS governments are introducing major new and proactive environmental \nprograms to strengthen the environmental component of the SDF under the supervision of the \nWGE. The CEP is to support the broad-based sustainable development agenda of the GMS \ncountries by mainstreaming the environment in the GMS Economic Cooperation Program, as \nstipulated in the SDF. The CEP will provide technical, operational, and financial support to \nupgrade the environmental management strategies, programs, and projects of the SDF and the \nRCSP. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  long-term  goal  of  the  GMS  Core  Environment  Program  is  a  poverty-free  and \necologically rich GMS. The TA will enhance the environmental sustainability and social equity of \nthe  GMS  Economic  Cooperation  Program,  thereby  increasing  its  development  potential, \nperformance, and impact. The outcome of the TA will be sound environmental management \nsystems and institutions that mainstream environmental and biodiversity protection in the GMS \nEconomic Cooperation Program and subregional development. \n \n9.  The TA will focus on program development and implementation. It will (i) assess the \nenvironmental sustainability of priority development strategies and investment plans for the \nGMS economic sectors and corridors, (ii) implement biodiversity corridor activities in at least five \npilot sites, and (iii) institutionalize environmental performance assessment (EPA) procedures \nand systems in the GMS countries. A program development and investment plan for 2009\u20132015 \n ", "  3\n \nwill  be  prepared.  It  will  focus  on  (i)  GMS  environmental  management  governance  and \ninstitutional development; (ii) the establishment, sustainable management, and financing of the \npriority biodiversity conservation corridors and associated high-value landscapes; and (iii) the \ninstitutionalization of decision support systems for environmental management and sustainable \ndevelopment planning, including EPA. The TA design and monitoring framework is given in \nAppendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The key components of the TA are \n(i)  environmental assessment of economic sector strategies and corridors; \n(ii)  biodiversity conservation and BCI implementation;  \n(iii)  environmental performance assessments and sustainable development planning;  \n(iv)  development  and  institutionalization  of  GMS  capacity  for  environmental \nmanagement; and \n(v)  program development, delivery, and sustainable financing. \n \n11.  Component (i) will ensure that development strategies and plans for the GMS economic \nsectors and corridors are environmentally sound, economically efficient, and socially equitable, \nand that they are designed and implemented with the use of up-to-date design methods and \ntechniques. Component (ii) will establish sustainable development and management regimes in \nthe GMS biodiversity conservation corridors, to prevent or reverse the fragmentation of high-\nvalue forest ecosystems. It will also endeavor to initiate a system whereby the hydropower and \ntourism  sectors  systematically  pay  to  conserve  non-marketed  ecosystem  services. \nComponent (iii) will build on the results of the Strategic Environmental Framework (SEF) I and \nII,  and  enhance  and  institutionalize  EPA  use.  Component  (iv)  will  move  to  build  effective \ninstitutional arrangements and policy frameworks for trans-boundary environmental protection \nand sustainable natural resource use in the GMS. The EOC will be attached to the Thailand \nResident Mission in Bangkok5 but will be functionally autonomous and will provide services to \nthe WGE and CEP partners. Component (v) will initiate strategies and mechanisms to promote \nthe financial sustainability of efforts to conserve natural systems and environmental quality in \nthe GMS. \n \n12.  The key activities of the TA will be (i) assessing the potential environmental impact of \ndevelopment strategies and investments in hydropower, road, and tourism in selected economic \ncorridors,  and  identifying  opportunities  to  pay  for  environmental  services;  (ii)  initiating  the \nestablishment of at least five biodiversity corridor pilot sites6 within GMS economic corridors to \nprevent  or  mitigate  ecosystem  fragmentation,  and  identifying  and  developing  sustainable \nfinancing  mechanisms  for  the  medium  to  long  term,  including  payment  for  environmental \nservices to local communities; (iii) doing research and building capacity for the next round of \nEPAs, and establishing EPA units in the GMS countries;7 (iv) making the EOC operational as \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2005.

Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the CEP is estimated at $36.11 million equivalent. The cost of the TA to \nbe administered by ADB is estimated at $25.57 million, which will be financed on a grant basis \nby the governments of the Netherlands ($13.20 million) and Sweden ($10.00 million), by the \nPoverty  Reduction  Cooperation  Fund9  ($550,000),  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  ($1.22 \nmillion), and in-kind contributions by the GMS countries ($600,000). Detailed TA cost estimates \nand a financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n14.  In  addition,  the  Government  of  Sweden  will  provide  in-kind  contribution  (parallel \nfinancing) of $700,000 to cover the secondment of international expertise to the EOC. In-kind \ncontributions will also be made by development partners including the United States Agency for \nInternational Development (USAID) ($3.00 million), Global Environment Facility/United Nations \nDevelopment Programme Mekong Wetland Biodiversity Project implemented by IUCN/Mekong \nRiver Commission ($1.80 million for Lao PDR), as well as NGO partners like WildAid/USAID \n($1.26 million for Cambodia), Conservation International ($172,709 for Cambodia), Fauna and \nFlora  International  ($325,844  for  Cambodia),  World  Wide  Fund  for  Nature  (WWF)/Wildlife \nConservation Society ($1.44 million for Cambodia), WWF ($1.70  million for the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic  [Lao  PDR]  and  Viet  Nam),  and  World  Conservation  Union  (IUCN) \n($153,000 for the subregion). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The TA will have a term of 3 years and will be implemented from January 2006 to \n31 December 2008. The TA is an innovative approach to providing a regional framework for \npartnerships between GMS countries, development partners, nongovernment organizations, \nand ADB under the umbrella and direction of the WGE.10 The partners will have a crucial role in \nimplementing this TA; hence, partnership agreements detailing the targets to be achieved and a \nbudget framework for funding the activities are proposed. \n \n16.  The activities of the proposed TA will be implemented on-site by local agencies and \nnongovernment partners, while the national implementing agencies11 will be responsible for \nnational and provincial coordination. The EOC will take over the support functions previously \ncarried out by ADB in terms of acting as secretariat to the WGE.12 The EOC will facilitate inter-\nsectoral coordination within the RCSP, and will be responsible for the timely and effective \nimplementation of the CEP. In the medium to long term, it is envisaged that the EOC will be a \nsustainable institution anchored in a subregional framework supported by the GMS countries. \n                                                 \n8  To be conducted only in ADB member countries. \n9  PRF: Safeguarding Biodiversity for Poverty Reduction in the Mekong Region. \n10 Building on lessons learned, experience, and designs from TA 6198-REG (footnote 6) and TA 6213-REG (footnote \n5). \n11 ADB is the Executing Agency in this TA,  while the implementing agencies are the WGE member-country \ninstitutions, which are responsible for overall coordination and supervision in each GMS country. These institutions \nare: Ministry of Environment (CAM), State Environment Protection Administration (PRC), and Ministry of Natural \nResource and Environment (THA and VIE). \n12 Organizing and holding WGE meetings, coordinating WGE activities, reporting to WGE, etc. \n ", "  5\n \n \n17.  Annual work plans and budgets will be submitted by the implementing agencies13 to the \nWGE through the EOC for review and approval. The CEP implementing partners will report \nevery 6 months to the WGE through the EOC. Annual reports of the GMS Core Environment \nProgram will be approved by WGE for public dissemination through print and electronic media. \nAt the next GMS summit in 2008, a comprehensive progress report on the program will be made \navailable to the GMS countries and the public. \n \n18.  Operationalizing the EOC will require the services of international consultants (up to \n25614 person-months), national consultants (up to 14415 person-months), and GMS country \nspecialists deputed to the EOC (up to 180 person-months). An overview of the EOC is in \nAppendix 3 and outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. International consultants will be \nengaged individually by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by \nthe Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. \nThe engagement of domestic (local) consultants will be delegated to the EOC and will be \naccording to arrangements satisfactory to ADB. Equipment for the EOC and CEP coordination \noffices  in  GMS  countries  will  be  procured  by  ADB  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. Details of procurement packages are in Appendix 5. After the TA, the equipment \nwill be transferred to national implementing agencies and partners. \n \n19.  An advance payment facility to be replenished on liquidation will be used to disburse \nfunds to (i) national implementing agencies; (ii) implementing partners like UNEP, WWF, and \nIUCN, which have entered into partnership agreements with ADB for the TA implementation; \nand (iii) the EOC, under the Thailand Resident Mission, to cover its operating costs. Both the \nnational implementing agencies and implementation partners will be required to maintain project \naccounts and have these accounts audited annually. To facilitate the timely flow of funds and \nreduce the administrative burden, EOC will be provided with a budget line for travel expenses \nunder the advance payment facility, to be liquidated monthly.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n20.  The President recommends that the Board approve (i) ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $13,200,000 to be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Government of the Netherlands, (ii) ADB administering a portion of technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $10,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of Sweden, (iii) ADB administering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding \nthe  equivalent  of  $550,000  to  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Poverty  Reduction \nCooperation  Fund,  and

Background and Purpose \n \n1.  The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) environment ministers\u2019 meeting in Shanghai, \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), in May 2005 and the second GMS summit in Kunming, PRC, \nin July 2005, endorsed the implementation of the Core Environment Program (CEP) and its \nflagship  component,  the  Biodiversity  Conservation  Corridors  Initiative  (BCI).  The  GMS \nenvironment ministers also endorsed the establishment of the Environment Operations Center \n(EOC)  in  Bangkok,  Thailand,  to  provide  operational  capacity  to  the  Working  Group  on \nEnvironment (WGE) and to implement the CEP and BCI. \n \n2.  The GMS WGE seeks to proactively fulfill its current mandate to (i) facilitate subregional \nenvironmental  projects,  (ii)  ensure  that  environmental  issues  are  properly  addressed  in \nsubregional projects in other sectors, and (iii) harmonize environmental management within the \nsubregion. \n \n3.  The  proposed  EOC  facility  will  serve  as  WGE  secretariat  for  coordinating  with \ndevelopment partners and GMS countries. The EOC will coordinate and facilitate the timely and \neffective implementation of the GMS Core Environment Program in collaboration with GMS \ngovernments, local communities, and nongovernment organizations. The establishment of EOC \nwill help maximize program synergies, and reduce the transaction costs and operational burden \non implementing agencies and program partners. \n \nB.  Environment Representation in GMS Working Groups \n \n4.  The role of building sustainability and environment into GMS development programs and \nprojects will require close linkage between the WGE and other GMS working groups. WGE \nneeds to be in a position to assist other working groups in mainstreaming environment in their \nsectors. It will do so by keeping those other groups informed of environmental trends and \nregional concerns, helping them review strategies and programs, contributing to strategy and \ninvestment design, and preparing environment safeguards and mitigation measures. The WGE \nwill  seek  to  (i)  make  development  actions  more  sustainable,  and  (ii)  build  environmental \ncomponents into development activities. To fulfill these aims, staged development of the EOC is \nrequired. \n \nC.  Staged Development of the EOC \n \n5.  The EOC will be set up in the following steps: \n \n(i)  Finalize funding arrangements (2005). Settle on the funding arrangements and \non  the  secondment  of  international  experts  to  the  EOC  with  interested \ndevelopment partners. \n \n(ii)  Recruit staff (2005\u20132006). ADB will facilitate the recruitment of the EOC staff \nincluding the EOC chief of operations, who will be recruited internationally, and \nstaff to be seconded from development partners. \n \n(iii)  Set up the EOC office (2006). In its first 3 years, the EOC will implement the CEP \nincluding the GMS Biodiversity Conservation Corridors Initiative. \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  11 \n(iv)  Recruit  national  staff  for  secondment  to  EOC.  ADB  will  recruit  at  least  two \ntechnical staff members from each member country associated with the CEP.  \n \n(v)  Prepare  a  detailed  institutional  development  plan  for  the  WGE/EOC  (2006\u2013\n2008). The EOC will prepare a 10-year institutional and program development \nplan for WGE and CEP. It will also prepare a paper on the options for the \ninstitutional anchoring of the EOC, with the projected costs, and circulate it to the \nGMS member countries through the WGE for their consideration. \n \nD.  Functions of the GMS Environment Operations Center  \n \n6.  The overriding concern of the WGE and its EOC is to conserve the natural systems of \nthe  GMS  for  the  ecosystem  services  they  provide,  to  protect  and  enhance  environmental \nquality, and to ensure sustainable development in the subregion. \n \n7.  The EOC\u2019s primary function must be to help define and keep watch on those areas that \nmust be kept in their natural state for the broad development benefits they provide to the local, \nnational, and subregional economies. \n \n8.  The EOC will focus on these five main tasks: (i) GMS environmental information and \nknowledge  management;  (ii)  GMS  environmental  management  and  conservation;  (iii) \nsustainable development design, environmental assessment, and oversight; (iv) coordination \nand liaison; and (v) acting as WGE secretariat. \n \n1.
