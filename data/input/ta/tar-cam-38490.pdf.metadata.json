During the Appraisal Mission for the Agriculture Sector Development Program (ASDP) \nfrom April to May 2003,1 the Government of Cambodia requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide advisory technical assistance (TA) to support implementation of the gender \nmainstreaming action plan developed under the ASDP.2 The TA Fact-Finding Mission3 visited \nCambodia 6\u201314 September 2004 and held discussions with the Government on the goal, \npurposes, scope, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference for consulting services. The Government confirmed the mission\u2019s aide memoire on 5 \nNovember 2004. Donors to the Gender and Development Cooperation Fund gave concept \nclearance for financing the TA in July 2004. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES4 \n2.  Agriculture accounts for 39% of Cambodia\u2019s gross domestic product and is the primary \nsource of employment for more than 70% of the labor force. Nearly 80% of these workers are \nprimarily engaged in subsistence agriculture. Women account for 56% of the primary workforce \nin subsistence agriculture and 54% of the workforce in market-oriented agriculture. Most of \nthese  women  are  unpaid  family  workers.  Women\u2019s  limited  educational  attainment  and \ncustomary practices that deny women land rights limit their productivity considerably. Women \nare a minority among the beneficiaries of services and resources directed at agriculture and \nrural livelihoods even though they make up the majority of farmers and informal sector workers. \nEstimates indicate that women account for only 10% of extension beneficiaries and that women \nagricultural extension workers account for only about 5% to 10% of the total. Furthermore, \nagricultural research and extension seldom focus on the activities of women farmers. \n \n3.  In addition, the limited capacity of the agriculture sector to absorb the growing workforce \nis pushing more young people to move to urban areas, where new employment opportunities \nremain limited. The social impact of urban migration is a growing concern, with important \ndifferences in the effects on young women and young men. More emphasis is needed on \nexpanding  employment  opportunities  in  rural  areas,  where  agro-processing  and  handicraft \nproduction are traditional female domains. Estimates suggest that women account for more than \nhalf the workforce in food processing and some 75% of that in handicrafts. Promoting linkages \nbetween producers, enterprises, and markets will facilitate the integration of agribusinesses and \ncraft production into rapidly growing domestic and international markets. Women, the majority \nowners  and  operators  of  rural  enterprises,  must  be  able  to  benefit  fully  from  emerging \nopportunities without being negatively affected.  \n \n4.  The Government\u2019s Second Socioeconomic Development Plan: 2001\u20132005 stipulates \nthat effective poverty reduction requires more concerted efforts than in the past. This implies a \nsustained focus on the rural poor, the development of the potential of agriculture, and an \nimproved effort to reduce prevailing gender inequalities in the sector. Promoting gender equity is \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2003.

A Fair Share for Women: Cambodia Gender Assessment. Phnom Penh.   \n \n ", "2 \n  \nalso one of the major thrusts of the national poverty reduction strategy (NPRS) for 2003\u20132005. \nThe NPRS acknowledges women\u2019s contribution to agricultural production and calls for gender \nmainstreaming in the sector through collaborative efforts between the Ministry of Agriculture, \nForestry, and Fisheries (MAFF) and the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs (MOWA).  \n \n5.  In line with the Second Socioeconomic Development Plan and the NPRS, the aim of the \nASDP is to promote sustainable growth of the market-based agriculture sector, and thereby \ncontribute to overall economic growth and poverty reduction. The ASDP facilitates agricultural \ncommercialization  and  diversification  and  ensures  that  the  poor  and  women  participate \nincreasingly in agricultural production, marketing, and postproduction. A draft action plan for \ngender mainstreaming was prepared in conjunction with the ASDP to systematically address \nand reduce gender disparities in the sector. In May 2003, MAFF set up the Gender Working \nGroup (GWG), which consists of representatives from key departments and agencies.5  The \nobjective of the GWG is to study and analyze gender issues and develop a gender policy and \nstrategy for the agriculture sector as a whole. The GWG commenced work in September 2003. \nCurrently  it  is  conducting  a  series  of  participatory  stakeholder  consultations  in  selected \nprovinces and developing a framework for a gender policy and strategy in the agriculture sector. \nThe scope of the TA is in line with the activities of the GWG and its outputs to date. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n6.  In accordance with the gender action plan under the ASDP, the purpose of the TA is to \nincrease women\u2019s productivity in agriculture so as to reduce poverty and promote growth. The \nspecific objectives of the TA are to (i) build gender-responsive institutions and systems at \nMAFF,  (ii)  ensure  gender-equal  access  to  agricultural  support  services,  and  (iii)  promote \nwomen\u2019s participation in market-based and diversified agricultural production. The objectives of \nthe TA are in conformity with the Second Socioeconomic Development Plan and the NPRS. \n \n7.  The expected outputs of the TA will be (i) the establishment of the institutional setup, \nsystems, procedures, and medium-term framework for capacity building to effectively integrate \nand monitor gender mainstreaming at MAFF; (ii) an increase in gender awareness and the \ngender mainstreaming capacity of key personnel in the agriculture sector; (iii) an improvement \nin women\u2019s access to agricultural extension services, information, and technology; and (iv) an \nexpansion of opportunities for women to build up and better manage agro-enterprises. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  Many factors limit women\u2019s productivity in agricultural production. The constraints are \ninterrelated and need to be addressed systematically. Thus, in accordance with the gender \naction plan, the TA will focus on three major constraints in the sector, namely: (i) institutional \nand procedural factors, such as the lack of appropriate systems and of clarity in relation to \nfunctions, roles, and responsibilities for gender mainstreaming; (ii) human resource and capacity \nfactors, including the lack of awareness, knowledge, and skills on the part of staff in MAFF and \nin provincial departments of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries (PDAFF) in relation to gender \nissues in general and in the agriculture sector in particular; and (iii) access and control factors, \n                                                \n5  Department of Accounting and Finance; Department of Agricultural Extension; Department of Agro-Industry; \nDepartment of Agronomy; Administration Department; Fisheries Department; Department of Forestry; Personnel \nand Human Resources Department; Department of Planning, Statistics, and International Cooperation; and the \nRoyal University of Agriculture.     ", "3 \n \nsuch as the absence of gender-responsive support services and service delivery. By addressing \nthese three factors concomitantly, the TA will develop an effective and sustainable structure and \nenvironment to enhance the role of women in the agriculture sector and empower them so as to \nreduce poverty and inequality.  \n \n1.  Creating an Institutional Framework for Gender Mainstreaming \n9.  Under  this  component,  the  current  roles  and  responsibilities  of  selected  MAFF \ndepartments and PDAFF will be examined with regard to gender mainstreaming. The review will \nbe conducted in conjunction with the rationalization of MAFF\u2019s departments under the ASDP. In \nparticular, the review will focus on how to integrate gender perspectives into MAFF\u2019s overall \nplanning cycle as guided by a medium-term expenditure framework and how to track the link \nbetween plans and expenditures. The TA will help MAFF fully incorporate gender perspectives \ninto its policy formulation, planning, and budgeting. \n \n10.  At the provincial level, job descriptions, annual individual work plans, and annual written \nperformance evaluations will be clearly defined for agricultural extension staff. Emphasis will be \nplaced on increasing the number of women agricultural extension workers. To upgrade district-\nlevel staff, the TA will recommend a system whereby all new graduates of the Royal University \nof Agriculture and other similar institutions will spend their first 3 years after graduating working \nat the district level. Special incentive schemes, e.g., in relation to housing and transportation, \nwill be provided to female graduates.  \n \n11.  Effective planning will require accurate and updated information on gender relations and \ngender disparities. Gender-disaggregated data have been collected under a number of projects \nimplemented  by  MAFF;6  however,  whether  the  data  are  actually  used  to  reveal  gender \ndisparities and are integrated into the planning process is not clear. The TA will consolidate the \noutputs and achievements of completed and ongoing projects and support the establishment of \na system at the Statistics Office of MAFF\u2019s Department of Planning, Statistics, and International \nCooperation.  \n \n12.  According  to  the  NPRS,  the  exclusion  of  women  from  participation  in  government \ndecisionmaking means that their needs are not considered and addressed and that sectoral \npolicies  and  programs  are  incomplete.  Good  governance  depends  on  more  women  being \nrepresented at all levels of government. The small number of women in MAFF (currently 20% of \nthe total, mostly concentrated at non-decision making levels) and PDAFF works against gender \nequity in employment and decisionmaking. The TA will examine the current situation and make \nrecommendations to reduce gender disparities in recruitment, transfers, promotions, and career \ndevelopment. Implementation of the recommendations will be carried out on a pilot basis under \nthe TA.  \n \n2.  Building Capacity for Gender Mainstreaming \n13.  The roles and responsibilities of the departments under the previous component will \nform the basis for the activities under this component. The TA will compile and consolidate \nmaterials prepared under the auspices of MAFF projects and develop training modules. The \nmodules will be a series of standardized units that can be modified to serve specific needs \n                                                \n6  Such as the Agriculture Productivity Improvement Project supported by the World Bank, the Agriculture Quality \nImprovement Project supported by Australia, and the Cambodia-Australia Agricultural Extension Project  supported \nby Australia.  \n \n ", "4 \n  \nacross MAFF. MAFF senior staff will be trained in gender awareness in the agriculture sector. \nSpecific and technical training will be tailored and conducted in accordance with the mandate of \neach department and PDAFF. Linkages between departmental objectives and functions and \nstaff  job  requirements  will  be  clear  and  logical,  with  explicit  and  quantifiable  performance \nindicators. The training activities will be coordinated by MAFF\u2019s Department of Personnel and \nHuman Resources.  \n \n14.  Recently, the Government and development partner agencies set up 17 sectoral and \nthematic technical working groups to explore possible areas of collaboration and harmonization. \nMAFF will chair and lead the groups on agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. The TA will support \nthe MAFF thematic working group members by deepening their understanding of gender issues \nin the agriculture sector and by facilitating coordination with the Technical Working Group on \nGender chaired by MOWA.   \n \n3.  Enhancing Women\u2019s Access to Agricultural Extension Services, \nInformation, and Technology \n15.  This  component  will  review  extension  materials  available  at  MAFF  and  develop \nagricultural  extension  service  modules  that  can  be  modified  to  meet  the  needs  of  target \nbeneficiaries. Extension services will focus on tasks performed mostly by women, such as seed \nselection, seed germination, harvesting, postharvest processing, livestock production, vegetable \ngardening, and community-based forestry. Alternative methods of service delivery that can \neffectively address gender bias will be identified and assessed based on their comparative \neffectiveness.  Extension  service  materials  developed  under  the  TA  will  be  used  to  train \nmembers of farmer groups under the ASDP Project, 50% of whom will be women.  \n \n16.  Women will fully be integrated into support services for the agro-enterprise component \nunder the ASDP Project. Agro-enterprise resource services will integrate gender perspectives, \nand  women  entrepreneurs  will  participate  in  the  training  programs.  MOWA\u2019s  women  in \ndevelopment centers (located in Kampong Cham, Kampong Speu, and Kampot provinces) may \nbe used as training venues, and qualified staff of women in development centers may be \nengaged as resource persons and trainers, along with other service providers, such as local \nnongovernment  organizations  and  local  private  sector  enterprises.  MOWA\u2019s  institutional \nexperience and ongoing endeavors in the field of  micro-enterprise development will be utilized \nfor the agro-enterprise resource service. Training modules and services will be developed in \nconsultation  with  MOWA,  women  in  development  centers,  and  provincial  departments  of \nwomen\u2019s  affairs  to  fully  reflect  gender-specific  needs  and  demands  in  agro-enterprise \ndevelopment. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $398,000 equivalent, of which $143,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $255,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has \nasked ADB to finance $300,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$157,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nGender and Development Cooperation Fund. The Government will finance the balance of the \nlocal currency cost, equivalent to $98,000, in kind through the provision of counterpart and \nsupport  staff,  office  accommodation,  and  other  related  services  and  facilities.  ADB  will \nadminister the TA fund. Cost estimates and the financing plan are presented in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "5 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  MAFF will be the executing agency for the TA and the head of the ASDP\u2019s Program \nSupport Unit will be the TA director. The TA director will liaise between the Program Support \nUnit, the ASDP\u2019s Project Coordination Unit, the GWG, and the TA consultants. The chair of the \nGWG will provide overall guidance and oversee the implementation of all TA activities. The TA \nconsultants will closely coordinate their work with the consultants for the Supporting Policy and \nInstitutional Reforms in the Agriculture Sector7 and the project implementation consultants under \nthe forthcoming ASDP Project. The TA consultants will also coordinate with relevant projects \nimplemented at MOWA, especially those relating to the development of micro-enterprises in \nrural areas.  \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented intermittently over 18 months from May 2005 to October \n2006 and will require 31 person-months of consulting services: 6 person-months of international \nconsulting services in institutional development and planning and statistics and 25 person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services  in  project  management  and  coordination,  gender \ntraining, agricultural extension services, and microenterprise development. Appendix 3 provides \nthe outline terms of reference for the consultants. The consultants will submit inception, interim, \nfinal and quarterly progress reports to ADB. ADB will select and engage the consultants in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by the Asian Development Bank and \nIts Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants.  ADB\u2019s  standard  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  will  be  used,  and \ntechnical proposals invited from short-listed consulting firms will be in ADB\u2019s simplified formats. \nEquipment for the consultant will be financed by ADB under the TA in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Equipment procured under the TA will become the property of the \nGovernment upon completion of the TA. \n \n20.  The outputs of the TA will be presented and shared at MAFF through meetings and \nseminars that will be organized by the GWG. The outcome and lessons learned will also be \nposted on ADB\u2019s web site.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to the Government \nof Cambodia to be financed on a grant basis by the Gender and Development Cooperation \nFund for Implementation of the Action Plan for Gender Mainstreaming in the Agriculture Sector, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2003.
