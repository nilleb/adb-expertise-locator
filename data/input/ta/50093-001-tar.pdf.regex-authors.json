INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Mongolia requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ncapacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  strengthen  country-wide  capacity  for \nmainstreaming  gender  across  sectors  and  at  local  levels,  and  addressing  gender-based \nviolence. A fact-finding mission took place in Ulaanbaatar on 22 February\u20139 March 2016, during \nwhich ADB and the government agreed on the impact, outcome, outputs, cost and financing, \nimplementation arrangements, and outline terms of reference for consulting services for the TA \nproject. The proposed TA is listed as firm.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1.2  \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Gender inequality is a significant constraint on economic growth and poverty reduction. \nRealizing  gender  equality  and  the  empowerment  of  women  and  girls  will  make  a  crucial \ncontribution  toward  achieving  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs).3 The  proposed \ncapacity  development  TA  will  help  Mongolia  realize  its  commitments  made  in  the  SDG \nframework, and in particular the goals under SDG 5 (achieve gender equality and empower all \nwomen and girls). \n \n3.  Mongolia has a comprehensive gender legislative framework but enforcement remains \ninadequate and inconsistent because of (i) limited accountability and capacity of governance \ninstitutions  to  mainstream  gender,  (ii)  gender-blind  policy  making,  and  (iii)  a  lack  of  sex-\ndisaggregated data in some sectors.4 Although some gender focal points have received gender-\nrelated training, they have limited capacity to guide the gender subcouncils at ministries and \nsubcommittees in aimags (provinces) in establishing gender mainstreaming strategies, policies, \nand programs. Relevant sex-disaggregated data and analysis (including gender auditing) for \ndecision-making in sectors that could influence policies and programs are limited, while gender \nqualitative and ethnographic analysis across sectors and geographical regions is practically \nnonexistent. Further, the last comprehensive country gender assessment for Mongolia was \npublished in 2005.5 These challenges make it difficult for the National Committee on Gender \nEquality (NCGE) network, and policy makers in general, to identify the main constraints and \naddress them. This is particularly acute  in sectors beyond health and education,  and has \nresulted in poor implementation of the Law on Promotion of Gender Equality (LPGE). \n \n4.   As shown by international best practices, making gender-specific legislation operational \nbased  on  sector  assessments  is  key  in  addressing  such  constraints.  The  institutional \nassessment conducted under an ADB-funded project in 2014 highlighted (i) the need for sector \ngender strategies and institutional capacity building at the national level, and (ii) that systematic \ngender mainstreaming in the implementation of sector and local development policies is crucial \nto ensure effective implementation of the LPGE.6 Against this background, the recent Universal \nPeriodic Review by the Human Rights Council provided 150 recommendations to Mongolia on \n                                                \n1   ADB. 2016.

Mongolia also has several \nlaws on the rights of women and children, including the Family Law, Labor Law, Child Protection Law, Child Rights \nLaw, Childcare Service Law, and Joint Pension Law. An amendment to the Law on Combating Domestic Violence \nwas approved on May 2016 but is no longer enforced pending synchronized approval with other associated laws, \nincluding the Criminal Code, by the new parliament. \n5  ADB and the World Bank. 2005.

Manila. \n ", "2 \nconcerns related to human rights, health, and education.7 Of those recommendations, 49 were \nrelated to gender inequality and 22 were on gender-based violence, violence against women, \nand domestic violence. The Government of Mongolia is committed to take actions to address \nthese issues by 2020. As the TA aims to address the root causes of several identified issues, it \nwill effectively support government efforts in this critical area of development inclusiveness. \n \n5.  ADB has been supporting and actively engaging with the NCGE network in Mongolia \nsince  2009.  Examples  include  support  for  the  design  and  adoption  of  the  LPGE,  and  for \ndeveloping an enforcement mechanism for gender legislation (footnote 4). The proposed TA will \nbuild on previous ADB support, and will follow up on the recommendations provided in the \ninstitutional assessment prepared in a previous ADB project (footnote 6). The project includes \nactivities to scale up gender mainstreaming initiatives by the government and United Nations \nagencies through the development of two sector-specific gender programs, guidelines, and a \ngender-sensitive budgeting manual. The proposed TA will also contribute to the implementation \nof  ADB\u2019s  Gender  Equality  and  Women\u2019s  Empowerment  Operational  Plan,  2013\u20132020  in \nMongolia.8 \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n6.  The impacts will be (i) gender equality in political, legal, economic, social, and cultural \nspheres promoted; and (ii) sustainable social development objectives ensuring gender equality \nachieved. The outcome will be that the gender equality agenda of key development sectors at \nthe national and aimag levels is mainstreamed into regular government programs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n7.  The TA aims to improve the capacity and performance of the government to enforce \ngender and gender-based violence legislation through the following outputs: (i) coherent and \nconsistent national, sector, and local gender equality framework adopted; (ii) gender-sensitive \nplanning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation training provided; and (iii) gender-\nrelated knowledge products disseminated and public awareness raised. The TA will also pilot \ninnovative, pro-poor, socially inclusive, and gender-responsive approaches toward planning, \nbudgeting, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation of two target aimags for potential \nreplication at a larger scale. \n \n8.  Output 1: Coherent and consistent national, sector, and local gender equality \nframework adopted. The TA will support policy advocacy with advisors to the Prime Minister \nand the cabinet secretariat, and consultation meetings with all stakeholders9 to ensure the \nadoption of a draft national program for government implementation of the LPGE. Advocacy \nefforts will include one-on-one lobbying and the production of policy fact sheets and infographics. \nThe national program for implementation of the LPGE will serve as a policy framework for \ngender mainstreaming in sector and local development policies and actions.

The gender programs will \nbe developed in line with key ADB operations in focus areas (education, urban development, \nagriculture, and social protection) that are critical to address the country\u2019s development needs. \nTo improve the capacity of local nongovernment organizations (NGOs), associations of civil \nsociety organizations in Selenge and Dornogobi aimags will be trained and mobilized to assess \nthe effectiveness of their gender subcommittee operations. Guidelines will be prepared and \ndisseminated to further build capacity to develop local gender subprograms. For replication \npurposes, the gender subprograms will be developed and adopted in two pilot aimags. \n \n9.  Output  2:  Gender-sensitive  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation training provided. Drawing on the results of output 1, output 2 will ensure practical \napplications across sectors and aimags by sensitizing about 370 central government officials \nthrough educational workshops, and by training more than 200 local government officials from \nall aimags playing key roles in implementing gender-related legal and policy frameworks. Media \npractitioners will also be trained on gender-sensitive and rights-based approaches in journalism. \nFor policy advocacy purposes, the first high-level national forum will be conducted with the \nheads  of  the  gender  subcouncils  at  ministries  and  gender  subcommittees  in  21  aimag \nadministrative  offices  under  the  auspices  of  the  Prime  Minister,  who  chairs  the  NCGE. \nFurthermore, a pioneer mandatory gender e-learning module will be developed and pilot tested \nat the Ministry of Finance and its central and local agencies (General Customs Authority, \nGeneral Department of Taxation, and aimag treasury divisions) for replication in other sectors. \nThe gender e-learning module will be integrated with an existing online course of the National \nHuman Rights Commission, allowing further dissemination among senior human rights officers \nnationwide. \n \n10.  Output 3: Gender-related knowledge products disseminated and public awareness \nraised.  To disseminate the project results and raise  broader public awareness on gender \nequality, several knowledge products will be produced and public outreach activities conducted. \nThe research will focus on achievements of and constraints on Mongolia since the first country \ngender assessment was prepared in 2005 (footnote 5) by assessing (i) the structural, cultural, \nand economic constraints on gender equality; and (ii) the bottlenecks to enforcing the gender \nlegislation. As an entry point of gender integration into private sector operations, the project will \nsupport (i) the development of the guidelines for the preparation of gender-inclusive workplace \naction plans, and (ii) pilot testing of the guidelines in two participating private businesses\u2014one \nin agribusiness and the other in mining.10 The first high-profile international conference on the \ngender equality SDG framework will be hosted by Mongolia in 2018 and will have prominent \ninternational  resource  speakers  to  showcase  international  best  practices  in  sector  gender \nmainstreaming. To enhance the quality of gender assessments, two national symposia will be \nheld on gender analysis and its implications, targeting researchers, postgraduates, and students. \nProject results will be disseminated to the public through innovative media events, including \nmedia campaigns, a photography contest with the theme \u201cgender equality through my eyes,\u201d \nmedia interviews, and social media marketing. \n \n11.  The communication strategy will be developed and implemented to raise awareness on \ngender inequality in socioeconomic spheres among the public through (i) a 3-month multimedia \n                                                \n10 UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) and UN Global Compact. 2010. \nWomen\u2019s Empowerment Principles\u2013Equality Means Business: A Partnership Initiative of UN Women, UN Global \nCompact Office.

Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $740,000, of which $700,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of office facilities, meeting venues, counterpart staff, and \nother in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MOLSP) will be the executing agency. The \nNCGE secretariat will be the implementing agency. A project steering committee\u2014composed of \nrepresentatives of the cabinet secretariat, relevant ministries, the NCGE, and the National \nHuman Rights Commission\u2014will be established to guide and support the project. Local NGOs \nwill  be  actively  involved  during  TA  implementation.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  14 \nNovember 2016 to 14 November 2018. The TA proceeds will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n14.  In consultation with the MOLSP, ADB will recruit a national consulting firm using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20.11 This will be done \nby inviting simplified technical proposals to provide 121.0 person-months of consulting services \nfrom 10 national experts and 3.5 person-months of consulting services from one international \nexpert. The gender consulting firm will provide technical consulting services to achieve all \noutputs specified in the design and monitoring framework. \n \n15.  ADB will also recruit a public communications consulting firm to raise public awareness \nof the importance of gender equality in all socioeconomic aspects, and women\u2019s economic \nempowerment. Output-based terms of reference will be used to recruit the firm using the quality-\nbased  selection  method.  ADB  requires  about  40  person-months  of  public  communications \nconsulting services from national experts (minimum of two key experts), with a total budget of \n$95,000.  Interested  organizations  will  be  requested  to  prepare  a  full  technical  proposal, \nincluding a methodology and approach to deliver the outputs of the contract and to determine \nthe number of experts required to achieve the set objectives. \n \n16.  Additionally, ADB will engage an individual national consultant as a project coordinator \n(17 person-months, intermittent) to ensure project implementation in close liaison with executing \nand  implementing  agencies,  relevant  ministries,  ADB,  and  other  stakeholders.  The  project \ncoordinator  will  be  responsible  for  procuring  equipment,  following  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time), which will be used for workshops and local \ntraining. Equipment procured under the TA will be turned over to the executing agency upon \ncompletion of TA activities. ADB will also engage resource persons (0.33 person-months each) \nfrom various countries, including Japan, the Republic of Korea, Norway, and the Philippines, to \nshowcase best practices at the international conference on the gender equality SDG framework. \nThe resource persons and consultants will be engaged following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \n \n                                                \n11 Should an NGO present an expression of interest during the selection process and be among the shortlisted \nentities, the consultant selection method will be changed to quality-based selection. \n ", "5 \n17.  To facilitate implementation, ADB may establish an advance payment facility with the \nMOLSP  to  support  agreed  cash  expenditures  for  workshops,  training  programs,  and \nconferences, with details of the proposed activities and cost estimates submitted through the \nMOLSP for ADB approval. ADB may also make certain direct payments (e.g., for workshop \nvenues). \n \n18.  Given  the  TA  component  on  public  communications,  the  expected  TA  outputs  and \noutcome  will  be  disseminated  through  an  innovative  media  campaign.  Further,  high-profile \ninternational and national conferences, launching workshops, and local training programs will be \nheld with the broad participation of the public and private sectors, beneficiaries, and civil society, \nfocusing on Mongolia\u2019s progress toward SDG 5 (achieve gender equality and empower all \nwomen and girls). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 to Mongolia to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Gender-Responsive \nSector and Local Development Policies and Actions, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n Impacts the TA is aligned with: \nGender equality in political, legal, economic, social, and cultural spheres promoteda \nSustainable social development objectives ensuring gender equality achievedb \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting   Risks \nOutcome  By 2019:    Weak \nGender equality  a.
