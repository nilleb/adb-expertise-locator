Strategy  20201 of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  mandates  ADB  to  develop, \nmobilize, and apply knowledge solutions to help the poor in our developing member countries. \nThe midterm review of Strategy 2020 highlights that \u201cDMCs increasingly seek ADB\u2019s knowledge \nto address complex challenges, improve the development impact of operations, and develop into \nknowledge economies.\u201d2 This was evident during ADB\u2019s 2014 annual meeting, where members \nemphasized ADB\u2019s continued relevance on challenges such as aging and urbanization, and ADB \nPresident  Nakao  stressed  ADB\u2019s  continued  help  by  tailoring  its  responses  to  the  specific \nconditions of countries.3 A strong and dynamic economic, scientific, and social knowledge base \nis a prerequisite for stimulating innovation and structural change (footnote 2, para. 123).  \n \n2.   The midterm review of Strategy 2020, the President\u2019s 10 points in his 21 November 2013 \nmemorandum  on  Reforming  ADB\u2019s  Institution-Wide  Knowledge  Management,4 the  Planning \nDirections:  Work  Program  and  Budget  Framework  2015\u20132017,5 and  the  first  Knowledge \nOperations Review Meeting (KORM)6 all provide fresh impetus and direction for taking a unified \n\u201cOne ADB\u201d approach to sharing knowledge with DMCs and serving as a source of best practices. \n \n3.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) will foster an enabling platform for ADB to work \nas \u201cOne ADB\u201d in providing knowledge solutions for its DMCs by creating structures and systems \nto better link ADB knowledge and operations, as well as staff, with DMC practitioners and with \ndevelopment partners. It will provide the foundation for jointly creating knowledge solutions to \ndevelopment  problems  in  DMCs.  The  cluster  approach  is  proposed  because  the  three \nsubprojects  provide  basic  components  for  improved  exchange  of  knowledge  solutions  with \nDMCs,  creating  significant  potential  synergies.  This  approach  will  also  support  ADB  in \nestablishing a sustainable mechanism to support knowledge work for its DMCs, because it \npotentially allows additional resources to subsequently be mobilized. The TA concept paper was \napproved on 3 February 2014.7 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  In general, ADB\u2019s stakeholders see ADB as having a very strong impact on overall \ndevelopment  and  being  an  excellent  source  of  knowledge.  However,  despite  knowledge \nsolutions being a driver of change, \u201conly half give good marks for promoting knowledge sharing \nand best practices.\u201d 8 A special evaluation study recommended ADB improve its approach to \ncapturing, sharing, and using knowledge.9 The Knowledge Management Directions and Action \nPlan (2013\u20132015) (KMAP) builds on the findings of the special evaluation study by defining \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008.

Manila: ADB. \n ", "2   \n \nADB\u2019s  goals  in  this  area  and  providing  a  plan  for  transformational  actions.10 The  KMAP \nspecifically recognizes the need for strategic and programmatic partnerships with centers of \nexcellence and knowledge hubs,  expanded ADB operations for innovation and pilot-testing, \ngreater South\u2013South knowledge sharing, and easier access to data and information, all of which \nhave DMCs as the primary beneficiary. As a result, efforts to be more strategic about knowledge \nmanagement and sharing across ADB grew significantly in 2013 and 2014.  \n \n5.  Many  DMCs,  particularly  those  who  graduated  to  middle  income  status,  have  vast \namounts of successful development experience that could be more widely shared. They are also \nwilling to learn from the experiences of other countries. For example, the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, India, and Indonesia each has 40\u201350 years of experience in supporting South\u2013South \ncooperation. Other countries, such as Malaysia, Thailand, and Viet Nam, have been increasing \ntheir efforts in this area over the recent years. Germany, Japan, and the Republic of Korea are \nstrong supporters of South\u2013South cooperation and triangular cooperation.11 ADB, the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, the United Nations Development Programme, and the World \nBank Institute  are  all  active  supporters  of  South\u2013South knowledge  sharing.  ADB\u2019s  regional \ncooperation programs and other TA projects have been using South\u2013South knowledge sharing \napproaches,  such  as  study  tours,  twinning  programs,  and  expert  exchanges,  to  achieve \nobjectives. The Phnom Penh Plan, the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Institute, \nand the Regional Knowledge Sharing Initiative (RKSI) provide examples. Knowledge hubs have \nalso been supported. Interregional knowledge sharing activities are critical for capturing good \ndevelopment experiences (e.g., with the Inter-American Development Bank) and are tackling \nissues common to Latin America and Asia and the Pacific. \n \n6.  These experiences, while signifying DMCs\u2019 rising expectations of ADB as a regional \ndevelopment agency, also highlight several critical weaknesses of ADB: (i) efforts at the project \nlevel are not linked to each other to ensure knowledge flows out of one DMC and into another; \n(ii) an operational mechanism does not exist to understand and respond to knowledge demand \nand supply of DMCs across the boundaries of ADB\u2019s operational departments; (iii) ADB does not \nhave a platform by which knowledge (including third-party, non-ADB content) held by ADB staff \nand consultants, DMCs, and development partners can be freely exchanged for the benefit of \nDMCs; and (iv) no mechanisms exist to capture the use of knowledge by DMCs and the impact \nof knowledge sharing. Major lessons learned include basing knowledge partnerships on well-\narticulated  demand  and  having  clear  design  and  monitoring  frameworks  with  measureable \nindicators.12 Staff  developing  and  implementing  knowledge  partnerships  should  follow  the \nrecommendations outlined in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Knowledge Partnerships.13 \n \n7.  The KMAP and KORM suggest ADB use its operations cycle to ensure ADB\u2019s knowledge \nsolutions are DMC-led (footnotes 6 and 10). The MTR Action Plan14 directs ADB to appoint \ncountry directors of resident missions as \u201cknowledge custodians\u201d, authorized to coordinate the \ndesign  and  implementation  of  country  knowledge  management  plans;  create  a  framework \ninvolving flexible procurement rules and financing arrangements to facilitate strategic knowledge \npartnerships with external institutions, including research and academic institutions and civil \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2013.

By  taking  fresh \napproaches to peer-to-peer sharing, learning, knowledge capture, and problem solving, ADB \nmay be able to work more efficiently with its DMCs to solve problems faster around the region.  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n8.  The TA focuses on innovative use of knowledge, technology, and partnerships to connect \ndevelopment practitioners in the common pursuit of solving development problems. First, it will \nallow ADB to proactively partner with potential centers of excellence (COEs) that have specific \nresearch activities that can directly contribute to ADB\u2019s work programs in selected countries. \nSecond, it will foster an ADB-wide framework with which ADB can broker and coordinate \u201cOne \nADB\u201d South\u2013South cooperation objectives and activities as well as complement and build on \nexisting  efforts,  such  as  the  RKSI.  Third,  it  will  provide  an  online  portal  that  will  promote \nknowledge sharing and collaboration. In summary, the TA will catalyze an enabling platform for \nDMCs and COEs to be active knowledge partners of ADB, with DMCs targeted as the primary \nbeneficiaries.   \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The overall impact of the TA will be DMCs adopting knowledge solutions addressing \npriority needs in Asia and the Pacific. The expected outcome will be ADB delivering knowledge \nsolutions in line with respective country knowledge plans for the benefit of DMCs.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Knowledge sharing needs to be approached from many angles and target many players.  \nIn addition to the traditional central government to central government approach, other important \nstakeholders\u2014including cities, local governments, communities, academics, researchers, and \ncivil society groups\u2014will be targeted through approaches that are relevant to them, including \njoint creation of content and sharing of third-party content.  \n \n11.  The TA comprises three subprojects. Each subproject focuses on a particular aspect of \npeer-to-peer knowledge exchange that enables development practitioners to learn from each \nother\u2019s experiences, crowd-source solutions,15 work together to solve problems, and have access \nto information and solutions in formats that meet their needs. Additional subprojects, or topping \nup of initial subprojects, may be proposed later, particularly if cofinancing is obtained.16  \n \n12.  Subproject  A:  Partnerships\u2014Centers  of  excellence.  ADB\u2019s  COPs  have  identified \npotential COEs that can contribute through their research programs and pilot demonstration \nactivities in areas such as inclusive business, renewable energy, water pollution, and sanitation, \nas well as research agendas of ADB.17 The CoPs will consult the DMCs through the country \ndirectors of resident missions and in line with the country knowledge plans to initiate institutional \n                                                \n15 \u201cThe practice of obtaining needed services, ideas, or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people \nand especially from the online community.\u201d Sourced from: www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary \n16 Based on the feedback from DMCs and lessons learned from the TA, proposals for scaling up will be prepared for \neach subproject and for which support from development partners and philanthropic donors (both corporate social \nresponsibility and foundations) will be sought with the help of ADB\u2019s Office of Cofinancing Operations. \n17 A good example is the collaboration with COEs in South Asia to introduce non-sewer solutions in urban areas in \nADB\u2019s work, supported by Sanitation Financing Partnership Trust Fund, a partnership of the Bill and Melinda Gates \nFoundation and ADB.  \n ", "4   \n \npartnerships with selected COEs and knowledge hubs. The COPs will develop and support work \nprograms with the selected COEs. Partner COEs can also be sources of external expertise to \nsupport ADB\u2019s COPs and operations with DMCs. The subproject will also implement a few pilot \ninnovative projects in partnership with other ongoing TAs18. ADB will share the outputs with \nDMCs as knowledge solutions, and publicly recognize the COEs that provide scalable and \nreplicable innovative ideas19. \n \n13.   Subproject  B:  South\u2013South  knowledge  sharing  program.  The  subproject  will \nestablish  the  systems  and  provide  DMCs  with  support  for  South-South  knowledge  sharing \nactivities in coordination with regional departments. Countries that can provide knowledge and \nexperience in these areas will be identified by ADB\u2019s regional departments and matched with \ntarget DMCs for South\u2013South learning activities, with the RKSI serving as an example. The most \nstrategic kinds of knowledge sharing will receive priority (e.g., peer consultations on sector policy \ndevelopment or development plan creation) with other examples being study tours, knowledge \nexhibitions, and twinning arrangements.20 Exchanges and their impact will be captured and \nshared in various accessible formats on the knowledge portal in a repository of good practices \nand lessons learned. Sector-based forums, meetings, and workshops could be considered on a \nlimited basis. Large, one-off summits and conferences will not be supported without follow-up \ndialogue and monitoring.  \n \n14.   Subproject C: Knowledge portal. The subproject\u2019s objective is to become the public \ninterface for supporting ADB\u2019s overall peer-to-peer knowledge exchange work and solutions to \ndevelopment challenges in DMCs. Separate from yet complementary to ADB\u2019s public website, \nthe portal will be structured around sector and thematic communities of practice (CoPs) that \nfunction  as  knowledge  hubs  for  sharing  ADB  and  non-ADB  (third-party21)  content  and  for \ncollaborating, including through social media channels and crowd sourcing. DMCs will be the \nprimary beneficiaries. The subproject will be the gateway to online tools, services and products,  \nsuch as case studies; technical blogs; ask-the-expert webinars, web chats, and online chats; \ntoolkits;  how-to  guides;  e-learning  courses;  and  TOR  repositories.  OIST  will  manage  the \ndevelopment of the systems and platforms as specified in the MTR Action Plan and Information \nSystems and Technology Strategy III. DER will ensure the subproject will complement, yet be \ndistinctive from ADB.org. The tools and services may be developed by OIST or be established \nthrough social media platforms, such as Linked-In. DER and OIST will provide advice on these. \nAn editorial team, located in RSDD and in coordination with the CoPs, will curate technical \ncontent  and  turn  it  into  digestible,  relevant  formats.  The  team  will  also  set  up  content \npartnerships  with  non-ADB  sources  in  DMCs  and  development  partners.  Original  ADB \n\u201csignature\u201d  areas,  such  as  virtual  study  tours,  are  being  created  through  other  projects. \nPractitioners in DMCs will be encouraged to create their own content as well as to crowdsource. \nTo build and maintain communities, be developed quickly, stay on the technological forefront, \nand prevent \u201creinventing the wheel\u201d, the portal is envisioned to seamlessly interface with well-\nestablished social media sites, such as Facebook, Scribd, Linked-In, and others as they evolve.  \n                                                \n18  The project team will partner with ongoing RSDD TAs, such as the Technical Assistance for the Establishment of a \nMarket Place for Transfer of Low Carbon Technologies to Asia and Pacific (2009) and the Cluster Technical \nAssistance Establishing a Pilot Center to Facilitate Climate Technology Investments in Asia and the Pacific (2012).   \n19  Further support to COEs will be provided in line with the MTR Action Plan\u2019s proposal to set up an innovation fund to \nprovide seed monies for supporting new and innovative projects selected through a competitive process. \n20  World Bank and the South\u2013South Opportunity. 2012.

", "    5 \n \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. Cofinancing will be explored to support additional projects.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.   ADB  will  implement  the  TA  through  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment (RSDD). Upon TA approval, the subproject proposals will be submitted for approval \nof the director general of RSDD, in accordance with ADB guidelines on cluster TA processing.23 \nSubprojects  will  be  designed  and  developed  in  close  collaboration  with  ADB  regional \ndepartments (including resident missions), COPs (thought leadership and guidance on content), \nDepartment of External Relations (web sites and dissemination) and the Office of Information \nSystems and Technology (IT platforms and systems). A steering committee comprising heads of \nDER, ERD, OIST, RSDD, and two regional departments will oversee the TA with a united \u201cOne \nADB\u201d approach, giving implementation advice and monitoring progress.  \n \n17.   The  intention  is  for  these  value-adding  structures,  systems,  and  activities  (e.g., \nsystematic documentation) to be integrated into ADB core operations and COP work to better \nsupport DMCs and eventually be financed through core budget (through potential cost savings \nfrom  amalgamating  ADB  websites  developed  through  regional  TA  projects,  currently  all \nindependently administered), through new TA subprojects with cofinancing, and/or with ADB staff \nrunning them. The portal will help reduce costs for setting up and maintaining knowledge hubs, \nand enable teams to concentrate on content, not portal building and technical maintenance. \nSubproject C will be the digital basis for subprojects A and B, and planned or existing activities \nby  ADB\u2019s  regional  departments,  RSDD,  and  COPs.  No  expansion  of  human  resources  is \nanticipated, and no additional budget will be requested. The TA will explore additional means to \ngenerate cost savings from other sources to sustain the work.  \n \n18.  The TA is expected to be implemented from September 2014 to August 2016.24 The TA \nwill require 47 person-months of international  consulting services and 80 person-months of \nnational  consulting  services.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  through  a \ncombination of recruitment approaches involving both firms (e.g., academic institutions) and \nindividuals, as appropriate. As this is a cluster TA project, consultant selection will apply different \nmethods depending on the size and nature of the contracts. The outline terms of reference for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. Disbursements under the TA will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis for \nKnowledge for Solutions, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n23 ADB. 2011.

A team of staff will oversee the overall technical assistance (TA) as well as lead the \nthree  subprojects  to  ensure that  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  staff members  in  ADB\u2019s \nRegional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  (RSDD),  in  collaboration  with  staff  in \nregional departments, internalize the knowledge from this TA instead of outsourcing all the work \nto consultants. Several consultancy inputs will, however, be needed to supplement staff inputs \nfor building a critical mass of content in appropriate formats and doing survey and technical \ntasks  associated  with  building  the  knowledge  portal.  This  implies  using  international  and \nnational consultants (individuals and firms) in supporting roles while the structures and systems \nare being developed. For the short-term technical activities leading to the physical design and \ndevelopment of the knowledge portal that are best packaged and managed independently, \ndigital agencies may be selected. The TA will require the services of experts in logistical and \nevent coordination, the internet, communications, marketing, and project management. Detailed \nterms of reference, the precise extent of consultancy inputs, and consultant selection methods \nwill be defined during subproject preparation, in accordance with ADB procedures for cluster TA. \nIndividual consultants will be recruited through the consultant management system, following \nADB\u2019s Operations Services and Financial Management Department guidelines.
