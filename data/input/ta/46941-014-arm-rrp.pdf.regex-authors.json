THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $25 million to International Energy Corporation (IEC) for the Sevan\u2013Hrazdan Cascade \nHydropower System Rehabilitation Project in Armenia.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Armenia imports around 60% of its primary energy requirements, mainly natural gas, \nand suffers from obsolete power generation infrastructure. The hydropower plants in the country \ndo  not  meet  international  technical,  economic,  or  environmental  performance  standards. \nDespite  its  favorable  topography  and  hydrology,  Armenia  suffers  from  underinvestment  in \nhydropower generation capacity. To overcome these problems, the government launched an \ninitiative to promote private sector investment in the country's energy infrastructure, including \nhydropower.  In  2005,  the  government\u2019s  Energy  Sector  Development  Strategy  targeted  an \nincrease of the country\u2019s renewable energy generation including hydropower generation from \n3,600 gigawatt-hours (GWh) to 5,100 GWh by 2025. \n \n3.  IEC approached the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 2011 to raise debt financing for \nits  modernization  and  reconstruction  program  for  2012\u20132017.  IEC  owns  and  operates  the \nSevan\u2013Hrazdan  Cascade  Hydropower  System,  which  supplies  about 10%  of the  country\u2019s \nelectricity. The system has a significant role in supporting the balance of the electric grid, and \nalso provides more affordable energy than thermal power plants. Given ADB\u2019s recent financing \nof private infrastructure in the country2 and the fact that the private banking market is still \nhesitant  to  provide  long-term financing,  IEC  approached  ADB  and  the  European  Bank for \nReconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD)  with  an  assumption  that  the  project  would  be \nfinanced by the two banks on a 50:50 basis. [Confidential information deleted] From initial \ndiscussions with IEC, RusHydro, and the EBRD, the project team believed that the project \npossesses sound fundamentals, that ADB\u2019s participation will bring significant developmental \nbenefits and demonstration impact, and that it will also send an important signal to the market, \nhelping  build  confidence  for  private  sector  participation  in  Armenia's  renewable  energy \ndevelopment. It was also noted that the project could become ADB\u2019s first loan to Armenia\u2019s \npower sector and would also be the first nonsovereign cofinancing by ADB and the EBRD in the \npower sector. \n \n2.  Project Design \n4.  The project involves the rehabilitation and modernization of four hydropower plants, the \ndiversion channels for three plants, and associated electrical equipment replacement at the \nsubstations. The planned rehabilitation will be completed in 2017. The project aims to restore \nthe capacity of the hydropower plants by 44.7 megawatts (MW), improve their reliability and \nsafety, and reduce IEC\u2019s operational and maintenance expenses. The project will also reduce \nwater leakage from the diversion channels and could increase power generated by the system. \nAfter repair  of the  diversion  channels,  it  is  estimated that  water  leakage  will  decrease  by \n                                                      \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2010.

The Borrower and/or Sponsor \n5.  IEC (the borrower) was incorporated in the Republic of Armenia in May 2003 and owns \nand operates the Sevan\u2013Hrazdan Cascade Hydropower System. The initial owner of IEC was \nINTER RAO, a Russian state-owned company. IEC took ownership of the system In July 2003 \nand obtained a license for generation of electric power in September 2003. In 2010, HydroInvest \n(a subsidiary of RusHydro) acquired INTER RAO's ownership in IEC, [Confidential information \ndeleted] and currently RusHydro (through HydroInvest) holds the majority of the shares (90%) \nand controls IEC. [Confidential information deleted.] \n \n6.  The  system  consists  of  seven  run-of-the-river  hydropower  stations  located  along  a \nwaterway of connected rivers (Hrazdan and Marmarik), canals, and reservoirs, principally fed by \nthe Marmarik River. The system was originally built between 1930 and 1965. Five stations are \noperational year-round and the remaining two stations work only during the irrigation season, \nwhen additional water from Lake Sevan is released into the system. The system\u2019s year-round \navailable capacity is 458.7 MW and operational capacity is 390 MW, the latter accounting for \n16% of estimated total current operational capacity in Armenia. A summary of information about \nthe system's seven hydropower plants is in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Summary of Sevan\u2013Hrazdan Cascade Hydropower System \nPower  Year of  No. of  Original Installed  Available  Unavailable \nPlant  Commissioning  Units  Capacity (MW)  Capacity (MW)  Capacity (MW) \nArgel  1953  4  224.0  168.0  56.0 \nArzni  1956  3  70.6  70.6  0.0 \nHrazdan  1959  2  81.6  81.6  0.0 \nKanaker  1936  6  100.0  87.5  12.5 \nSevan  1949  2  34.2  24.0  10.2 \nYerevan 1  1962  2  44.0  22.0  22.0 \nYerevan 3  1960  1  5.0  5.0  0.0 \n  Total    20  559.4  458.7  100.7 \nSource: International Energy Corporation. \n \n7.  IEC\u2019s financial position has been affected by its aging assets and insufficient investment. \nIEC\u2019s assets have been heavily depreciated without capital expenditures, and its balance sheet \nis small. The tariff has been determined based on the asset size, and the revenue has not been \n ", "3 \nsufficiently strong. This created a vicious circle between low asset value and low revenue. \nHowever, the project (with ADB financing under RusHydro\u2019s guarantee) aims to break the \nvicious circle. With investment to upgrade the assets, the size of the balance sheet will grow, \nand the revenues will improve with the revised tariff, which incorporates the cost of investment. \n[Confidential information deleted.] \n \n8.  The sponsor, RusHydro, was incorporated in 2004 in the Russian Federation as part of \nthe state program for power sector reform and creating a competitive industry. RusHydro is \n60.4% state owned and its remaining shares are publicly traded on the Moscow and London \nstock  exchanges.  RusHydro  is  the  Russian  Federation\u2019s  largest  hydropower  generation \ncompany  and  the  leader  in  renewable  energy  using  water  currents,  sea  tides,  wind,  and \ngeothermal  energy.  The  company  owns  61  power  generation  facilities  with  total  installed \ncapacity of 35,200 MW. RusHydro is currently rated BB+ by Standard & Poor's and Fitch, and \nBa1 by Moody's, reflecting (i) its strong business fundamentals as the Russian Federation's \nlargest low-cost hydropower generator, which is well positioned to benefit from the country's \nwholesale power market liberalization and should be able to absorb the market fluctuation risk; \nand (ii) the high likelihood that it would receive extraordinary government support in a crisis. \n \nTable 3: RusHydro Key Financials (Consolidated) \n(RUB million) \nItem  2009  2010  2011 \nProfit and Loss       \n  Sales and services  338,460  526,581  362,599 \n  Net profit  32,112  10,399  29,493 \nBalance Sheet       \n  Current assets  98,657  109,534  125,124 \n  Total assets  506,866  744,993  811,783 \n  Equity  405,800  539,568  525,659 \nNote: RUB30.62 = $1 as of 27 February 2013. \nSource: RusHydro. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n9.  The development impact includes a successful rehabilitation of aging renewable-energy \nproduction  assets.  Successful  implementation  of  the  project  will  increase  the  supply  of \nrenewable energy through facilitating more rehabilitation and new investment in the sector, and \nwill help foster confidence among potential investors and lenders and promote further private \nsector investment in Armenia\u2019s power sector.  \n \n2.  Outcome \n10.  Armenia\u2019s power consumers will receive up to 600 GWh per year of more reliable low-\ncost,  carbon-efficient  energy  from  the  Sevan\u2013Hrazdan  Cascade  Hydropower  System.  The \nproject\u2019s operational safety, reliability, and efficiency will increase. In addition, the successful \nimplementation of the project will contribute to the improvement of environmental performance \nof the system. \n \n ", "4 \n3.  Outputs \n11.    Successful  implementation  of  the  project  will  result  in  the  rehabilitation  and \nmodernization of the system. The available capacity of hydropower plants in Armenia will be \nrestored by 44.7 MW on completion of the project. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n12.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB's  Strategy  2020  in  relation  to  environmentally \nsustainable growth, as one of the three strategic agenda items. Strategy 2020 emphasizes \ninvestment in infrastructure with further emphasis on promoting private sector participation. In \naddition, Strategy 2020 highlights ADB's operational emphasis on expanding the use of clean \nenergy sources, reducing greenhouse gas emissions.3 \n \n13.  The country partnership strategy for Armenia is under preparation and expected to be \nfinalized in 2013. The new strategy is expected to emphasize development of the power sector \nand the private sector as key priority areas. The project is expected to be consistent with the \nforthcoming strategy. \n \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n14.  The project is fully consistent with the ADB Energy Policy (2009), which makes support \nfor renewable energy generation a key priority. The policy further stresses the importance of \nharnessing  energy  efficiency,  which  is  essential  to  improve  energy  security  and  reduce \nemissions of greenhouse gases.4 \n \n[Confidential information deleted.] \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  Table 4 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  The project will operate under the general regulatory framework applicable to \nhydropower companies in Armenia. The tariff is set by the PSRC. \nManagement  IEC has three directors on its board, all nominated by RusHydro. Key \nmanagement roles are held by (i) A. Grigoryan, general director (previously \ndeputy general director of ENA); (ii) A. Mkhitaryan, director of economics and \nfinance (concurrently advisor to the deputy chairman of RusHydro); and \n(iii) H. Sargsyan, chief engineer (over 20 years of hydropower experience). \nImplementation period  2012\u20132017 \nRehabilitation works  IEC will procure goods and services for the proposed rehabilitation through \ninternational competitive bidding. Engineering, procurement, and construction \ncontracts will be used to the extent possible. \nRevenue structure  IEC has a power purchase agreement with ENA, the sole electricity distributor in \n                                                      \n3  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "5 \nAspects  Arrangements \nArmenia, and it is effective until January 2015. The tariff payable by ENA under \nthe agreement will be in accordance with the approval by PSRC. The approved \ntariff reflects the amount of capital expenditures to implement the project, the \nreturn from capital expenditures, and the company\u2019s O&M expenses. \nMajor cost structure  There is no fuel cost for the project, and the key cost items include administrative \n  costs and O&M costs. \nOperation and  O&M will be handled primarily by IEC staff, and assistance will be provided by \nmaintenance  RusHydro and contractors. \nPerformance  Key performance indicators, including output and outcome indicators, will be \nmonitoring  reported by IEC to the Asian Development Bank and the European Bank for \nReconstruction and Development.  \nENA = Electric Networks of Armenia, IEC = International Energy Corporation, O&M = operation and maintenance, \nPSRC = Public Services Regulatory Committee. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and International Energy Corporation. \n \n[Confidential information deleted.] \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n16.  The proposed loan of up to $25 million to IEC will be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources. [Confidential information deleted.] \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n17.  The proposed transaction merits ADB's assistance for the following reasons: \n \n(i)  The project will restore part of the currently unavailable old power generation capacity, \nand make it available for generating additional electricity. \n(ii)  The project will enhance operational efficiency, reliability, and safety of the system and \nhelp avoid major outage and associated impacts on the populace. \n(iii)  The project will contribute to more efficient use of water resources by reducing water \nleakage  from  the  system.  Water  savings  are  expected  to  lead  to  higher  electricity \ngeneration. In addition, the government is currently making efforts to increase the water \nlevel of Lake Sevan, which was reduced significantly during the Soviet era. Reducing \nwater leakage will also support this effort of environment conservation. \n(iv)  ADB will provide long-term financing, which is required for successful implementation of \nthe project but not easily available in the market. The nature of the project (e.g., long \nconstruction period, high upfront capital expenditure, competitive tariffs assuming a long \nasset life) is appropriately financed by long-tenor debt to better match with the cash-flow \nprofile. \n(v)  ADB facilitated introduction of foreign currency escalation in the project tariff. ADB had \nrounds of discussion with the PSRC, the regulator, to ensure that the new tariff will \ninclude  key  parameters  to  achieve  a  cost  recovery  level  and  support  the  system\u2019s \nsustainability. The project will need to be financed by US dollar-denominated long-term \ndebt, as the local banking market does not have capacity to provide long-term debt in \nlocal currency. In view of this, the PSRC approved a new tariff reflecting the project cost \nand foreign currency escalation. \n(vi)  ADB will contribute to strengthening IEC\u2019s policies on environment, health, and safety. \nIEC will implement the new environmental and social management plan, which was \n ", "6 \nprepared with assistance from ADB. ADB will monitor implementation of the plan and will \ncontinue providing recommendation to ensure building up IEC\u2019s capacity to implement \nthe plan appropriately. \n \n[Confidential information deleted.] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n18.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples. The EBRD, which is cofinancing the project, has classified the project as B \nunder  its  Environmental  and  Social  Policy  (2008).  The  potential  environmental  and  social \nimpacts  of  the  project  have  been  recognized  and  effective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize, \nmitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and \nplans. The institutional capacity and commitment of IEC to manage the project\u2019s social and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate. Information disclosure and consultations with \naffected people are conducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \n19.  A review and audit of IEC\u2019s current management and operations was prepared against \nADB\u2019s relevant environmental and social policies and principles, Armenian and European Union \nlegal requirements, and the EBRD\u2019s performance requirements. The proposed rehabilitation \nprogram  does  not require  undergoing the  environmental  assessment  process  according to \nArmenian legislations, except for Yerevan 1 reconstruction where reservoir dredging is planned. \nAll works are planned within the existing facilities, channels, hydraulic structures, and property \nboundaries, and rehabilitation does not consider an increase of the original capacity of the \nhydropower plants. The main environmental impacts and risks from the operations and planned \nrehabilitation are related to reservoir management, including proposed dredging activities for \nYerevan 1 reconstruction; management of oils and lubricants for turbines, transformers, and \nsupport  infrastructure;  management  of  lead  and  acid  batteries;  material  and  waste \nmanagement; and management of occupational and community health, safety, and security. An \nenvironmental and social action plan and corrective action plan were prepared, including an \naction  item  for  preparing  an  environmental  assessment  of  dredging  works  for  Yerevan  1 \nreconstruction before dredging starts. Other key measures in the plan are pollution prevention \nfor  oil  and  all  materials  and  wastes,  facilitation  of  agreements  to  solve  community  water \nconnections,  and  strengthening  of  the  emergency  response  plan.  IEC  will  develop  and \nimplement an oil management plan to properly handle and store raw and used oil to prevent \nspillage, include oil spill clean-up procedures, provide for disposal and recycling of used oil and \ndefine roles and responsibilities of staff involved in raw and used oil management. IEC will also \ndevelop and implement a comprehensive waste management plan that will include a description \nof  all  waste  types  generated,  procedures  for  collection,  handling,  labeling,  storage  and \ntransportation of wastes for each type, waste prevention, reduction and reuse strategies, a \nrecord-keeping system and as well as the roles and responsibilities of staff involved in waste \nmanagement. IEC will strengthen its existing emergency response plan in order to address \n(i) community-related  emergencies,  (ii) risks  from  flooding  from  natural  causes  and  illegal \nconstruction along the natural river course and floodplains, and (iii) risks from failure of company \nfacilities and structures. IEC will also establish a corporation-wide environmental and social \nmanagement  system  based  on  ADB  and  ISO  14001  requirements,  and  adopt  it  at  each \nhydropower  plant.  As for  protecting  Lake  Sevan,  a fish  protection  system  is  in  place  and \n ", "7 \nrehabilitation of the structures at water diversion point at Lake Sevan is not planned. Thus, the \nplanned rehabilitation will not affect the lake. \n \n20.  A  stakeholder  engagement  plan,  which  describes  the  process  for  engaging \nstakeholders, including information disclosure and consultation with affected people and other \nstakeholders,  was  also  prepared.  The  stakeholder  engagement  plan  also  incorporates  a \ngrievance mechanism for resolving complaints about IEC\u2019s environmental performance. The \nplanned rehabilitation works will be carried out within the existing footprint and no expansion of \nexisting facilities is planned. Such rehabilitation will not require any additional land acquisition \nand there are no indigenous peoples in the project area. There are also no known outstanding \nsocial safeguards issues connected with the facilities to be rehabilitated. \n \n21.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions \nrequiring IEC to comply with national labor laws and, in addition, to take specific measures \n(including in relation to contractors) in line with internationally recognized core labor standards \nfor the ADB-financed portion of the project, and in compliance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy.5 The  project  is  categorized  as  having  no  gender  elements  and  does  not  have \nmeasures to provide benefits specific to women. \n \nB.  Anticorruption and Anti-Money-Laundering Policies \n22.  IEC was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and policy \nrelating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003). \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  will \nrequire IEC to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption, money-laundering \nactivities, and the financing of terrorism, and to covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in \nsuch activities. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations  \n23.  The proposed direct loan lies within the medium-term country, industry, group, and \nsingle project exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n24.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),6 \nthe Government of Armenia\u2019s no objection to the proposed assistance to IEC will be obtained. \nADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, \nfollowing approval of the proposed assistance by the Board. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n25.
