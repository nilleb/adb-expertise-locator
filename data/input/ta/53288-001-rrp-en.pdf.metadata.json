I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $100,000,000 (in Indian rupee equivalent), as of the subscription date, in the \nNational Investment and Infrastructure Fund Limited (NIIF) managed NIIF Fund of Funds-I (NIIF-I) \nin India.1 \n \n2.  NIIF-I proposes to invest in up to 10 private equity funds managed by domestic, experienced \nfund managers in India. These funds will each invest in a portfolio of growing companies in India \nacross multiple sectors including climate or green infrastructure, affordable housing, infrastructure \nservices, agribusiness, health care and education.2 \n \n3.  NIIF-I is a targeted $1 billion category II alternative investment fund (AIF) registered with the \nSecurities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).3 National Investment and Infrastructure Fund \nLimited, established in November 2015, serves as the investment manager and manages NIIF-I.4 \nThe Government of India, which is represented by the Secretary of the Ministry of Finance\u2019s \nDepartment of Economic Affairs (DEA), sponsors NIIF and NIIF-I. \n \nII.  THE FUND \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n4.  From 2015 to 2017, private equity fund managers based in India raised approximately $6 \nbillion, 50% more than from 2012 to 2014.5 However, India\u2019s share of fund raising across Asia and \nthe Pacific remained essentially flat from 2015 to 2017 compared with 2009\u20132011. This occurred \ndespite the steadily increasing number of active fund managers that reached an all-time high of 491 \nin 2017, the surge of private equity investment volume to more than $26 billion in 2017 and 2018, \nand historically high exit volumes totaling $16 billion in 2017 and $33 billion in 2018.6 Moreover, the \nshare of locally based private equity fund managers participating in domestic equity investments \nwas much lower in India at 42% than in the People\u2019s Republic of China at 83% (footnote 5). \nTherefore, Indian institutional investors can enhance fund-raising efforts of domestic fund managers \nby increasing their investment allocation to the private equity asset class. However, this type of \ninstitutional support has historically been lacking in India because domestic institutions (e.g., \n \n1  NIIF-I is a single currency Indian rupee (INR) fund and all USD amounts shown in this document are approximate. \n2  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n3  In India, alternative investment funds (AIFs) are defined in Securities and Exchange Board of India Regulations, 2012 \nas any privately pooled investment fund, (whether from Indian or foreign sources), in the form of a trust or a company \nor a body corporate or a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP). Category II includes AIFs such as private equity funds \nor debt funds for which no specific incentives or concessions are given by the government or any other regulator. \n4  NIIF was established to manage the NIIF platform, comprising NIIF-I and two other funds also sponsored by the \nGovernment of India (the Master Fund and the Strategic Opportunities Fund). The Master Fund is a targeted $2.1 \nbillion fund (of which about $850 million had been raised as of June 2019) that will focus on investments in companies \nand/or  projects  with  operating  assets  in  core  infrastructure  sectors  such  as  transport,  energy,  and  urban \ninfrastructure. The Strategic Opportunities Fund (target size: $3 billion) is being developed and will have an asset-\nfocused investment strategy and will consider investments into greenfield projects. NIIF is identifying and recruiting \na dedicated investment team for the Strategic Opportunities Fund that will finalize the investment strategy and \ndevelop a pipeline of investment opportunities. The timing for the establishment of the Strategic Opportunities Fund \nis uncertain. To date, NIIF-I is the only fund-of-funds that NIIF manages. \n5  McKinsey & Company. 2019.

However, private equity as a source of growth capital for companies in India is quickly \ngaining prominence relative to other more traditional sources. India\u2019s economy (in nominal terms) \nhas approximately doubled in size since 2009.7 During this period, private equity has also increased \nfourfold,  the  syndicated  loan  market  and  (non-private  equity)  foreign  direct  investment  have \nremained  mostly  flat,  and  initial  public  offerings  have  been  volatile  (footnote  5).  Given  the \nmomentum of its economy, India has also expanded in private equity deal sizes because larger \ndeals have become increasingly available. For example, deals greater than $100 million have more \nthan doubled in count from 2015 to 2017 compared with 2012\u20132014 (footnote 5). Companies are \nseeking larger investments, and funds able to write large checks are well-positioned to respond. \n \n6.  Therefore, to support this maturing private equity industry and assist India-domiciled private \nequity funds to raise investment capital efficiently from international and domestic institutions, NIIF \nestablished  NIIF-I\u2014India\u2019s  first  large,  domestic  fund-of-funds  platform\u2014in  March  2018.  The \nGovernment of India requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support NIIF with an investment \nin one of its fund platforms and ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department has been engaged \nwith NIIF since January 2017 before settling on the proposed fund-of-funds vehicle. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n7.  NIIF-I\u2019s mandate is to invest in private equity funds dedicated to India and managed by \nestablished third-party domestic fund managers with proven track records across multiple market \nand economic cycles. NIIF-I intends to anchor these funds by providing significant commitments of \nbetween $50 million and $150 million in each (generally between 25% and 35% of a fund\u2019s \ncommitted capital).8 As an anchor investor, NIIF-I aims to catalyze additional capital from foreign \nand domestic institutions to help these funds reach their target size, thereby enabling them to \nexecute their respective investment strategies. \n \n8.  NIIF-I aims to construct a portfolio of up to 10 funds diversified across strategies (including \nminority growth, control growth, and special situations) and products (equity, mezzanine, and debt). \nIt is expected that targeted funds will consist primarily of single sector dedicated funds focused on \nclimate or green infrastructure, affordable housing, infrastructure services, agribusiness, health \ncare, and education, which are all aligned with ADB\u2019s existing sectoral mandates. NIIF-I will also \nconsider selectively investing in multi-sector funds.9 \n \n9.  NIIF-I achieved a first close in March 2018, which initiated its 6-year commitment period. \n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to \nInformation Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].

Thus, investments in listed securities will not be a primary focus of the portfolio funds. \n ", "3 \ninvestment rights on a no-fee and no-carry basis.

The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Sujoy Bose, Executive \nDirector of Investments Prakash Rao, and Chief Operating Officer Rajiv Dhar lead NIIF. As of 30 \nJune 2019, NIIF employed 42 staff across the NIIF platform (footnote 4), including a three-person \ninvestment team for NIIF-I headed by Anand Unnikrishnan. NIIF-I\u2019s investment committee currently \nconsists of Bose, Rao, and Dhar and may also include up to two independent members. Investment \ncommittee decisions are based on the unanimous approval of all investment committee members.13 \n \n15.  Board of the investment manager. NIIF\u2019s board comprises six directors (including two \nGovernment of India representatives and one independent director) as follows: (i) Secretary, DEA; \n(ii) Additional Secretary, DEA; (iii) Sanjay Bhardarkar, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority nominee; \n(iv) Deepak Parekh, chairman of HDFC Limited;14 (v) Ishaat Hussain, independent director and \nformer finance director of Tata Sons; and (vi) Sujoy Bose of NIIF.15 The board is responsible for \nsetting the strategic direction of NIIF\u2019s activities and meets periodically to establish and review NIIF\u2019s \noverall strategy. The board does not involve itself in investment or operational decisions relating to \nany of NIIF\u2019s fund platforms.

ADB will provide an equity investment of the Indian rupee equivalent, as of the subscription \ndate, of up to $100,000,000 in NIIF-I.16 ADB\u2019s proposed investment will not exceed 25% of NIIF-I\u2019s \ntotal committed capital (it is not expected to exceed 11% of its aggregate committed capital at final \nclose) and will not result in ADB being the single largest investor.17 \n \nB.

Exit strategy. [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to \ndisclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].18 NIIF envisages the following \nmethods to realize exits from NIIF-I\u2019s fund investments: (i) liquidation of the funds NIIF-I has \ninvested in; and (ii) selling NIIF-I\u2019s stake in funds to other institutional buyers.  \n \n22.  Reporting arrangements. NIIF will be required to provide ADB with (i) an annual report \nsummarizing financial information received from NIIF-I\u2019s investee funds as required under India\u2019s \nAIF regulations, (ii) annual audited and unaudited financial statements of NIIF-I, (iii) a quarterly \nnewsletter containing updates on the investee funds, and (iv) quarterly valuation reports.19 NIIF \nwill also be required to provide to ADB an annual development effectiveness monitoring report. \nADB will review this information and follow up with NIIF if more information or clarifications are \nneeded. If the information received raises issues that could impair the value of ADB\u2019s investment \nin NIIF-I, ADB could decide to put NIIF-I on a watch list for more frequent reviews and closer \nattention. Additional information on exit strategy and reporting arrangements is provided in paras. \n12\u201314 of Ownership, Management, and Governance (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2). \n \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n23.  Catalyzing capital. Based on simple assumptions, ADB with its $100 million exposure to \n100 portfolio companies could potentially catalyze $7 billion of growth capital for small and medium \nenterprises (SMEs) in India, thereby highlighting the significant multiplier and mobilization effects of \n \n16 ADB may split the total commitment amounts into two equal tranches of $50 million in 2019 and $50 million in 2020. \n17 Some funds retain the ability to recall for reinvestment, subject to certain limits, a portion of the capital previously \ndistributed to investors. If agreed in relation to NIIF-I, appropriate limits on any such recall of capital will be required.  \n18 [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n19 ADB will seek to remove and/or clarify certain conditions in the NIIF-I documents that qualify this reporting obligation. \n ", "5 \ninvesting in a fund-of-funds platform such as NIIF-I.20 Since ADB is internationally reputable, the \nproposed investment may help attract new investors to fund the remaining gap necessary for NIIF-\nI to reach its $1 billion target size. \n \n24.  Governance and standard setting. Through its seat on NIIF-I\u2019s advisory board, ADB will \nprovide oversight on important governance matters, which is helpful as NIIF seeks additional capital \nfrom other institutional investors. By participating, ADB could also help improve environmental and \nsocial safeguards aspects of NIIF-I and ensure that underlying funds and their investee companies \nwould be obligated to comply with ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. \n \n25.  Institution building. With NIIF-I, NIIF (with the support of the government) is creating a \nfirst-of-its-kind domestic platform in India that can support the local private equity industry to write \nlarge check sizes to anchor domestic funds and enable them to reach target sizes more quickly. \nFaster access to investment capital will significantly benefit potential investee companies, many of \nthem SMEs that urgently need growth capital to execute expansion plans more quickly. As a \nsignificant investor, ADB would contribute meaningfully toward this important government initiative \nto strengthen India\u2019s domestic capital markets. \n \nE.  Risks \n \n26.

Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n37.  Consistency with ADB strategy. The proposed investment aligns strongly with operational \npriorities outlined in ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.23 These include (i) addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequalities by generating quality jobs, improving education, and achieving better health \nfor  all;  (ii)  tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability; (iii) making cities more livable by providing integrated solutions; and \n(iv) promoting food security by improving market connectivity and agricultural value chains.

Consistency with country strategy. The investment is consistent with the three strategic \npillars of the country partnership strategy, 2018\u22122022 for India, including (i) boosting economic \ncompetitiveness to create more and better jobs, (ii) inclusively providing infrastructure networks and \nservices, and (iii) addressing climate change and increasing climate resilience.25 \n \n39.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The ADB Operational \nPlan for Health, 2015\u20132020 strongly supports private sector approaches for addressing quality, \nefficiency, and financing issues in the health sector.26 Furthermore, the ADB Financial Sector \nOperational Plan, 2011 and its 2017 review recommend focusing on finance sector development \nthrough investments that promote inclusive finance by supporting affordable housing financing.27 \n \n23 ADB. 2018.

NIIF will incorporate its environmental and social policies and principles and ESMS \nprocedures for NIIF-I (updated to reflect Safeguard Policy Statement and 2001 Social Protection \nStrategy requirements) into a management system for NIIF-I to use in its fund investments. Each \nunderlying fund will be required to adhere to NIIF\u2019s policies and principles and NIIF-I\u2019s ESMS \nprocedures (updated to include ADB\u2019s safeguards and social requirements, as described above) \nand to reflect the same in its ESMS.  \n \n43.

The ESMS (for \nNIIF and its underlying funds) will require appropriate monitoring, reporting, and disclosure of \ninformation; and consultation with affected people in accordance with ADB requirements. Excusal \nrights will be covenanted in the legal agreements (see para. 31). NIIF will also be required to include \nthe following in its regular reporting information to ADB: (i) the nature of investments or subprojects \nand categorization, (ii) compliance with the safeguard and social requirements, and (iii) compliance \nwith national laws and/or regulations and internationally recognized standards.29 \n \n44.
