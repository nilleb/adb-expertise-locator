The persistence of these has worsened the poverty\nsituation with (i) the rise in the number of poor from 18 million in\n1987/88 to 45 million in 1998/99 or 33 percent of the population, (ii)\nworsening  income  inequality,  and  (iii)  women  carrying  a\ndisproportionate share of the burden of poverty. Poverty reduction,\ntherefore, is central to the Government\u2019s economic planning. The\nmost obvious manifestation of poverty is low income resulting from\nlack of access to affordable financial services. Currently, less than\n5 percent of poor households have access to affordable financial\nservices  from  institutional  sources.  The  Government,  therefore,\nconsiders MF critical and integral to its poverty reduction efforts.\nThe  MF  sector  is  not  prominent  in  Pakistan.  The  potential  of\nincreasing the role of MF in poverty reduction by enhancing its\noutreach is constrained by (i) lack of a stated policy, legal, and\nregulatory  framework  for  MF;  (ii)  few  microfinance  institutions\n(MFIs);  (iii)  absence  of  mechanisms  to  integrate  social  capital\nformation with MF services; and (iv) financial and organizational\nproblems  of  commercial  banks  and  development  finance\ninstitutions (DFIs).\nMarginalization of women, vulnerability of the poor, lack of skills for\neffective  utilization  of  financial  services,  and  inadequate  basic\ninfrastructure facilities inhibit the expansion of the MF sector. The\nsupply of MF from informal sources is intermittent and reflects the\nweak bargaining power of the poor. The number of nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs) that could specialize as MFIs are few.\nInvestments  to  enhance  the  supply  of  MF  services,  both  from\nprivate  and  public  sectors,  have  been  minimal  due  to  the\nperception of a limited market. Even households that have access\nto MF from institutional sources are not assured of continuity and\nquality  of  services  because  of  the  limited  resource  base  and\ninadequate  retail  capacity  of  MFIs.  To  address  the  issues  of\noutreach and sustainability in the context of increasing poverty, the\nGovernment aims to develop a pro-poor financial system that will\nhave a significant poverty reduction impact.", "iii\nClassification Primary Objective: Core poverty reduction\nSecondary Objective: Gender and development\nEnvironmental Category B. An initial environmental examination was undertaken\nAssessment and is summarized in an appendix.\nThe Sector Development Program\nObjectives and The key objective of the MSDP is to reduce poverty. The MSDP\nScope will develop the MF sector to efficiently provide financial and social\nservices to the poor. MF services, provided at affordable prices,\nwill  have  a  significant  poverty  reduction impact  and  thereby  (i)\nincrease  incomes  of  poor  households;  (ii)  enhance  outreach,\nespecially to women; (iii) build social capital; and (iv) reduce risks\nfaced by the poor. The MSDP will initiate an integrated package of\npolicy reforms, institutional development, and outreach expansion\nto catalyze the growth of the MF sector.\nPolicy Framework The agreed policy framework and actions to develop the sector\nand Actions include (i) adopting an enabling policy framework for MF sector\ndevelopment;  (ii)  establishing  a  Microfinance  Bank  (MFB)  as  a\nprivate-public  enterprise  in  partnership  with  NGOs  to  catalyze\nsector growth; and (iii) putting in place a legislative, supervisory,\nand regulatory framework to encourage more institutions to provide\nMF services.\nOther significant policy actions are (i) establishing mechanisms for\nenhancing  social  capital  through  community  mobilization  and\ncapacity  building  (Microfinance  Social  Development  Fund,\n[MSDF]), and access to basic community-based infrastructure for\npoor households (Community Investment Fund [CIF]); (ii) piloting\nrisk mitigation mechanisms for the poor through Risk Mitigation\nFund  (RMF)  and  Deposit  Protection  Fund  (DPF);  and  (iii)\nrestructuring DFIs, i.e., closing the Federal Bank for Cooperatives\nand  initiating  reform  of  the  Agricultural  Development  Bank  of\nPakistan, both of which undermine MF sector growth.\nCapacity Building Institutional strengthening support under the MSDP will (i) develop\nthe capacity of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the central bank,\nto take a proactive role in MF sector development; (ii) assist MFB\nin establishing operating systems and procedures, product pricing\nand promotion, measures to improve participatory process in social\nmobilization,  and  training;  (iii)  train  members  of  community\norganizations (COs); and (iv) assist new MFIs wishing to enter the\nMF market.\nThe Investment The objective is to leverage policy framework actions and provide\nProject resources for a significant poverty reduction impact by increasing\ninvestment  in  small  income-generating  subprojects  and\nemployment generation among the poor. Support will be provided\nfor (i) outreach expansion (credit line), (ii) social capital buildup,", "iv\nand (iii) institutional strengthening. In the context of a conducive\npolicy framework, these will catalyze the growth of the MF sector\nand attract investors and retailers.\nThe credit line will be supplemented by MFB equity, deposits, and\nborrowings  to  finance  the  investments  of  about  560,000  poor\nhouseholds  (about  4  million  people)  for  successive  cycles.  To\nsupport this, assistance will be provided to MFB for product and\nsystems development, capacity building, training, and equipment\nand  vehicles.  The  investment  loan  will  also  support  the\ntransformation of two NGOs into licensed MFIs.\nAbout 24,750 COs, comprising 560,000 poor households, will be\ndeveloped in a participatory manner through a network of NGOs as\nthe delivery point for financial services, and provided intensive and\nsustained support for capacity building. Nearly 40 percent of these\nwill  be  women  COs.  The  CO  activists  will  receive  training  on\ncommunity mobilization and management; capacity enhancement\nof  the  poor;  and  leadership  skills.  In  addition,  about  4,500\nsubprojects for small-scale community-based infrastructure will be\nfinanced. MSDF and CIF will fund these investments.\nSocial and Membership in COs will facilitate access to MF and social services\nEnvironmental leading to greater social and economic empowerment of the poor.\nMeasures These opportunities are especially significant for women who have\nhad little opportunity to interact with institutions external to their\ncommunity.  The  involvement  of  COs  in  identifying,  planning,\nexecuting,  and  monitoring  physical  infrastructure  projects  will\nenhance access of poor communities to infrastructure to improve\ntheir  livelihoods  through  efficient  and  productive  use  of  local\nresources.  Through  their  participation  in  MF  service  delivery,\nNGOs will become more effective in working with communities; this\nwill  lead  to  opportunities  for  expansion  and  greater  impact  on\npoverty reduction. MFB will ensure that borrowers are aware of\nenvironmental issues, and that these are satisfactorily taken into\naccount in the use of loan funds.\nBenefits By addressing multiple dimensions of poverty, the MSDP will have\na significant and sustainable poverty reduction impact, during and\nbeyond  the  MSDP  duration.  The  development  of  a  conducive\npolicy and legal framework will catalyze private investments and\nprivate-public  synergies  for  augmenting  the  retail  capacity  for\noutreach. The promotion of a lead institution such as MFB will\ngenerate the momentum for the MF sector to grow and realize the\npotential investments and institutional diversity. Partnerships with\nNGOs for MF service delivery will spawn a countrywide movement\nto  enhance  MF  outreach  at  reduced  cost  to  the  poor.  At  full\nimplementation, MFB will provide access to nearly 9 percent of the\npoor households in the country, with prospects for services to be\nexpanded. The assured source of funding from MSDF and CIF will", "v\nstrengthen  civil  society  nationwide  with  positive  externalities,\nparticularly those related to gender. RMF and DPF will reduce the\nvulnerability of the poor.\nThe Policy Loan\nLoan Amount and ADB will provide a loan of $70 million equivalent from its Special\nTerms Funds resources. The loan will have a term of 24 years, including a\ngrace period of 8 years. An interest of 1 percent per annum will be\ncharged  during  the  grace  period,  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter.\nProgram Period The loan will be released in two tranches. The first tranche of $50\nand Tranching million  will  be  released  on  loan  effectiveness  and  the  second\ntranche of $20 million ewithin 24 months from the first tranche\nrelease, subject to compliance with conditions for its release.\nExecuting SBP will be the Executing Agency and will coordinate with the\nAgency Ministry of Finance on policy reforms. A project management unit\nwill  be  established  at  SBP  headquarters  in  Karachi.  SBP  has\ncreated a Microfinance Support Division comprising a Microfinance\nPolicy Unit, and a Consultative Group of major stakeholders for\nwider consultation on MF-related issues.\nProcurement Loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost,\nexcluding duties and taxes of imports. A negative list will apply.\nCounterpart Funds Counterpart funds generated from the loan will be placed as the\nGovernment\u2019s contribution to MSDF, CIF, RMF, and DPF.\nThe Investment Loan\nLoan Amount and ADB will provide a loan of $80 million equivalent from its Special\nTerms Funds resources. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a\ngrace period of 8 years. An interest of 1 percent per annum will be\ncharged  during  the  grace  period,  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter.\nParallel Bilateral The Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation is preparing a\nSupport feasibility study in consultation with ADB to strengthen the capacity\nof SBP. The Department for International Development of United\nKingdom  is  considering  providing  support  for  MFB  capacity\nbuilding.\nImplementation SBP will be the Executing Agency. A project implementation unit\nArrangements and will be established in MFB to manage implementation and provide\nExecuting Agency required reports concerning the delivery and use of inputs.\nProcurement and Procurement of goods and services will be in accordance with\nConsulting Services ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Expenditure procedures will be\nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.", "vi\nConsultants to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan will\nbe recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants. A total of 66 person-months of international and 37\nperson-months of domestic consulting inputs will be required for\nimplementation.\nTime Frame The  investment  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years  with\ncompletion expected by 31 December 2006.\nRisks and Safeguards The risks for the policy framework actions relate to slower than\nexpected reforms and the possibility of political interference in the\nbusiness decisions of MFB and MFIs. Policy dialogue, stakeholder\ncoordination,  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  reforms,  and\ncapacity building support are effective safeguards. Autonomy and\ngood corporate governance of MFB is ensured by the provisions in\nthe  MFB  statute,  ownership  pattern,  and  professional\nmanagement.\nThe major risks for the investment Project are (i) low growth in\nincome of the poor, (ii) marginalization of women, (iii) dilution of\npoverty  focus,  and  (iv)  inadequate  capacity  of  MFB  leading  to\nimplementation delays. In addition to increased economic growth\nand pro-poor planning by the Government, the effective safeguards\nare  (i)  mainstreaming  of  gender  in  organization,  products,  and\nservices;  (ii)  adoption  of  successful  practices  including\npartnerships with NGOs and COs for effective poverty targeting;\nand (iii) significant investment in capacity building.", "~\nvii\n63000'E 73000'~\nPAKISTAN\nMICROFINANCE  SECTOR\nDEVELOPMENT  PROGRAM\n\" -;=-\n,~.'0-' /( .\n.cnitral\n'\\(:'  -~'  \" yN :  Casu. ~\": [\n0 50  100 200 -: r.

I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on two proposed\nloans to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Microfinance Sector Development Program\n(MSDP).\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. The number of poor people in Pakistan more than doubled during the 1990s. Nearly 33\npercent  of  the  population  is  classified  as  poor.1  The  incidence  of  poverty  will  continue  to\nincrease if economic performance does not improve, directed poverty reduction interventions\nare not enhanced, and delivery of pro-poor services not improved. Therefore, the Government\nhas made poverty reduction its prime objective and identified microfinance (MF) as a critical\nelement of its poverty reduction strategy.\n3. The Government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to consider financing\nan MF project to provide financial services to the poor and to establish microfinance institutions\n(MFIs)2 to provide access to affordable MF services to a majority of the poor. In December\n1997, ADB approved a technical assistance (TA)3 to help the Government prepare the project.\nThe consultant submitted the final report in December 1999 and a series of consultations\nbetween the Government and ADB followed on the concept, design, and components of the\nproposed project. The Fact-Finding Mission visited Pakistan in June 2000 to review the MF\nsector to develop an integrated package4 of policy reforms, institutional development, and\ncapacity building to catalyze the growth of the MF sector in consultation with government\nagencies, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and funding agencies. A sector development\napproach was identified as the most effective way to address the policy, investment, and\ncapacity building needs in a systematic manner to build a pro-poor financial system. The\nAppraisal Mission5 visited Pakistan during 7-25 August 2000 to enhance the scope of the MSDP\nand firm up the implementation arrangements. The Government\u2019s development policy letter and\nthe policy matrix, presented in Appendix 1, summarize the understandings reached by the\nMission. The program framework is shown in Appendix 2, and sector indicators in Appendix 3.\n4. The Mission worked closely with stakeholders when designing the MSDP. Of particular\nsignificance is the coordination with and involvement of NGOs, especially the microfinance\ngroup (MF Group),6 a network of NGOs active in MF, in the (i) design of the MSDP, (ii) direction\nof expected reforms, and (iii) partnership for outreach expansion. The institutional aspirations of\nNGOs,  their  concept  of  the  requirements  of  the  poor,  especially  poor  women,  and  the\nmethodology to deliver services are central to the design of the MSDP. ADB has consulted with\nthe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank when formulating the MSDP. Discussions\non  possible  parallel  financing  were  undertaken  with  the  Swiss  Agency  for  Development\n                  \n1 The poverty line in Pakistan is derived on the basis of income that can provide daily intake of 2,250 calories per\nperson (2,450 calories per adult in rural areas and 2,150 in urban areas).\n2    Institutions  whose  major  business  is  the  provision  of  MF  services.  These  could  be  formal  institutions  or\nnongovernment organizations.\n3 TA 2937-PAK: Pakistan Rural Microfinance Project, for $600,000, approved on 12 December 1997.\n4 The reform package was developed from the analysis and recommendations of several sector studies, including\n(i) TA 5836: Consultations on Bank\u2019s Microfinance Strategy: In-Country Consultation, for $400,000, approved on 1\nMarch 1999; (ii) Asian Development Bank. 2000. Rural Asia Study: Beyond the Green Revolution. Manila; and (iii)\nGovernment of Pakistan. 2000. Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Islamabad.\n5 The Mission comprised A. Sharma, Project Economist, Mission Leader; H. Sharif, Senior Counsel; N. Sinsiri,\nFinancial Analyst; and A. T. Sweetser, Social Development Specialist.\n6  The MF Group is sponsored by the Aga Khan Foundation and the Asia Foundation.", "2\nCooperation, Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, and the United\nNations Development Programme.\nIII. THE SECTOR\nA. Macroeconomic Context\n5. Pakistan\u2019s economy in the 1990s has been marked by declining growth rates, fiscal\nimbalances,  deterioration  of  physical  infrastructure,  inadequate  social  safety  nets,  and\ninstitutional weaknesses resulting from poor governance. The persistence of these factors has\nworsened the poverty situation. Economic sanctions compounded long-standing socioeconomic\ndifficulties. Erosion of investor confidence in the latter part of 1998, the virtual cessation of\nprivate  capital  flows,  and  the  suspension  of  new  official  development  assistance  affected\neconomic growth. The trade deficit grew sharply, foreign exchange reserves were less than two\nmonths of imports, and total foreign debt stood at $30 billion at the end of June 1999.\n6. The  structural  reforms  undertaken  by  the  Government  have  resulted  in  real  gross\ndomestic product (GDP) growth of 4.5 percent during FY2000 as against 3.2 percent in FY1999.\nThe Government has indicated its willingness to speed up the pace of structural reforms to meet\nthe major challenges of (i) reducing poverty, (ii) improving governance and administration, (iii)\nimproving the fiscal and balance of payments positions, (iv) restoring investor confidence, (v)\nachieving higher growth on a sustainable basis, and (vi) improving social indicators. To assist\nthe  Government\u2019s  reform  efforts  and  to  provide  balance  of  payments  support,  a  stand-by\narrangement amounting to $1.5 billion is expected to be approved by the International Monetary\nFund in November 2000. Discussions are ongoing for a comprehensive multiyear package\nunder the Poverty Reduction Growth Facility, which is expected to be concluded in the first half\nof 2001. The rescheduling of official debt under the Paris Club is expected in early 2001. The\nWorld Bank is processing a structural adjustment loan of $350 million for possible approval by\nmiddle of 2001. The reform agenda includes structural changes in major economic sectors,\nfiscal reforms, provincial finance reforms, judicial reforms, and private sector development. ADB\nis supporting legal and judicial reforms, among others.\nB. Sector Description and Recent Performance\n1. Overview\n7. The institutional structure of the financial system in Pakistan is elaborate. The State\nBank of Pakistan (SBP), the central bank, manages and executes monetary, credit, interest\nrate, and foreign exchange policies, and is the sole prudential regulator for all deposit-taking\ninstitutions. SBP oversees 21 domestic scheduled commercial banks (CBs) of which 4 are\nstate-owned, 21 foreign banks, 4 specialized banks, 11 development finance institutions (DFIs),\n16 investment banks, 3 discount and guarantee houses, 4 housing finance companies, and 2\njoint venture companies. State-owned CBs hold almost 60 percent of the total assets of the\nfinancial  institutions  and  have  primarily  financed  working  capital.  The  DFIs  hold  about  11\npercent of the total assets and have provided term finance to industry, and both term and short-\nterm  finance  for  agriculture.  Other  financial  institutions  such  as  leasing  companies  and\ninvestment banks together account for barely 5 percent of the banking system\u2019s assets. Among\nthe financial institutions, 6 CBs and 2 DFIs have a limited MF portfolio. The MF market is\nessentially served by NGOs, and informal arrangements by agricultural traders, input suppliers,\nmoneylenders, and landlords, especially in rural areas.", "3\n8. Institutional MF7 is a recent development in Pakistan and, therefore, has a very limited\noutreach. However, the poverty reduction potential of MF is widely recognized at the policy-\nmaking level and among the development community. In the economic and social context of\nPakistan, MF is understood to comprise financial services, particularly savings and credit, for\nthe poor with a significant degree of social intermediation. This involves improving the social\ncondition of the poor who have been largely excluded from access to financial and social\nservices, and includes community mobilization, skills development, risk mitigation, and access\nto basic infrastructure. Initial savings up to PRs2,000 ($35) and a first time loan of about\nPRs16,540 ($295)8 are generally considered as MF.\n9. Policies  and  guidelines  governing  the  financial  system  and  the  framework  of  the\nGovernment\u2019s poverty reduction strategy influence the MF sector. The environment for MF has\nimproved with the recognition that MF is critical to poverty reduction and NGOs can be effective\ndevelopment partners to enhance the quality of service through participatory community-based\napproaches. NGOs can attain legal status, and are eligible to receive resources from aid-funded\nprojects, Government-funded projects, and from projects where the Government has borrowed\nfrom funding agencies.\n2. Clients and Client Characteristics\n10. As of June 1999, Pakistan\u2019s population was estimated at 134.5 million. Two thirds of the\npopulation live in rural areas. The number of poor is estimated at 45 million (33 percent of the\npopulation)  in  6.3  million  households.9  Of  the  poor,  33  million,  representing  4.7  million\nhouseholds live in rural areas. All poor households are potential clients for both financial and\nnonfinancial social services. Government considers half the adult poor population (nearly 10\nmillion) as potential MF clients. Among this client base, women bear a disproportionately high\nshare of the burden of poverty due to (i) low social status, (ii) lesser endowments of land and\nproductive assets, (iii) limited access to economic opportunities and social services, and (iv)\nrestricted  mobility.  Women  are  poorer,  less  healthy,  and  less  educated  than  men.  These\ndifferences are more pronounced in rural areas (Appendix 4). Even though economically active,\nthe contribution of women is inadequately documented, understood, and appreciated.\n11. In urban areas, the poor include vendors, small traders, and laborers in the service,\ntransport, and small industry sectors. The four categories of primary rural occupations are:\nlandowners, sharecropper-tenants, rural artisans, and landless laborers. Sharecropper-tenants\nare among the poorest. Bonded labor is common among this group. Artisans, the traditional\nservice  providers  to  the  rural  community  (e.g.,  blacksmiths,  carpenters,  weavers,  barbers,\ntailors) are mostly poor. Landless laborers are among the poorest of the poor.\n12. Fifty-two percent of rural income is generated outside agriculture. Reliance on secondary\noccupations is increasing as agriculture can no longer meet the income needs of the growing\nrural  population  and  subsistence  agriculture  cannot  absorb  the  labor  surplus.  These\noccupations include (i) paid employment, (ii) investments in small businesses, (iii) diversification\ninto related occupations where possible (i.e., blacksmiths who undertake all forms of metal\nwork), (iv) employment outside the community, and (v) migration to urban areas (estimated at\n1.3 percent per annum). However, because of limited education and skills, sharecroppers and\n                  \n7  Institutional MF is defined to include MF services provided by both formal (banks, cooperatives) and semi-formal\n(NGOs) institutions.\n8  A loan size equal to half of the per capita GDP is often considered as a proxy for microcredit. A lower loan size\nalso ensures a greater depth of outreach (to the poorest among the poor).\n9  Estimates based on average 7 members per household.", "4\nlandless laborers have fewer options other than to provide domestic services, and make and\nsell handicrafts and toys.\n13. The typical client profile of a poor woman who seeks MF services is a woman in her\nearly 30s, who never attended school. She lives with her husband and three children, his elderly\nmother, and his younger brother\u2019s family. One child is a daughter who is engaged to be married,\nand her other two children are boys; the older son will start middle school in the district center\nthis year, so funds are not available for the younger to stay in school any longer. She helps her\nhusband for several hours a day on the family\u2019s two small fields plus the land they lease from\nthe landlord during most of the year. All of her chickens died recently when a disease swept\nthrough the area. She shares responsibility for cooking, cleaning, and caring for others in the\nhome with her sister-in-law. She dreams of replacing her hens and buying a buffalo that would\nproduce milk for sale, so that she can help her daughter marry, try to send her son to school,\nand keep the family from having to borrow money from the landlord, which might lead to their\nlosing their remaining land.\n3. Microfinance and the Poor\na.  Demand\n14. The average size of loan taken by poor households from NGOs is about PRs16,540\n($295)  at  an  interest  rate  of  18-20  percent  per  annum.  Considering  these,  the  estimated\npotential demand for microcredit is about $2 billion10 based on the number of poor households\n(6.3 million) or about $3 billion based on half the adult poor population (10 million). Similarly, the\nestimates of deposit possibilities range from $225 million to $350 million per annum. Based on\npopulation distribution, two thirds of this demand is considered to emanate from the rural poor.\nIn MF projects implemented by NGOs in Pakistan, the depositors outnumber borrowers by 2-4\ntimes. The poor emphasize the safety and accessibility of savings facilities as many have lost\ntheir savings in the past due to failures of cooperatives and finance companies.\n15. Most of the demand for MF in rural areas is for agriculture production (50 percent),\nlivestock (25 percent), and the balance for other household-based income-generating activities\n(IGAs). In urban areas, most of the demand is for small business and self-employed ventures.\nHouseholds are extended families and the pool of labor within a family unit creates the potential\nfor a diverse range of income-earning opportunities. Demand attributes include (i) small and\nfrequent loans; (ii) terms compatible with the nature of activity; (iii) preference of women, due to\nrestricted mobility, for simple and speedy delivery mechanisms placed within the community;\nand (iv) significant and sustained social preparation to familiarize the poor with managing IGAs.\nInterest rate sensitivity is high in rural areas due to the general low level of economic activity.\nThe apprehension of becoming indebted, particularly among women, due to failed enterprises\n(e.g., death of livestock, failure of business, crop failures) is widespread.\nb. Supply\n16. If the supply of MF services was adequate, the MF sector would be the largest sector of\nthe financial system in terms of clientele base. Overall, the MF market is underdeveloped with\nan  institutional  outreach  of  about  200,000  (60,000  NGOs,  140,000  CBs  and  DFIs)11  for\n                  \n10 From this base, the annual incremental credit requirement would be $200 million representing larger loans in\nsubsequent loan cycles.\n11 CBs and DFIs, though included, provide loans 4-5 times the size of microcredit and not necessarily to the poor.", "5\nmicrocredit loans. This is about 3 percent of poor households. The CBs hold about 417,000\nsavings accounts deposited by NGOs on behalf of their members. One private sector leasing\ncompany has initiated a leasing service to provide assets for hire to poor households. Insurance\nto mitigate the risks for the poor does not exist. The National Rural Support Program (NRSP)\nand  other  members  of  the  MF  Group  provide  demand-based  customized  training  on  MF.\nTraining skills for social intermediation, though developed, is grossly underfunded.\n4.  Financial Sector Reforms and Microfinance\n17. The Government considers an efficient financial system necessary for macroeconomic\nstability. Therefore, the banking system is being strengthened12 by (i) fundamentally changing\nnorms for governance; (ii) restructuring to conserve assets, downsizing staff and branches, and\nreducing bad debts; (iii) implementing debt recovery measures; (iv) strengthening the prudential\nand supervisory framework; (v) improving legal and judicial enforcement of banking courts; and\n(vi) privatizing all but one state-owned CB. SBP has been empowered in all matters concerning\nmonetary and banking policies, as well as for governance and management of the financial\ninstitutions.  These  reforms  are  to  be  extended  to  the  DFIs.  The  Government  plans  to\nrestructure, recapitalize, downsize, and privatize the DFIs. Interest rates were deregulated and\nloans up to PRs100,000 ($1,785) are not required to be collateralized. In general, the reforms\nconstitute a positive financial environment. Restoring SBP\u2019s authority in banking supervision\nand greater transparency requirements have significantly strengthened good governance.\n18. Complementing these reforms, the ADB-funded Capital Market Development Program13\naims to accelerate the mobilization of long-term resources and improve the efficiency of its\nallocation through a diversified and competitive capital market. The major developments include\n(i) establishment of a central depository system, (ii) automation of stock exchanges, and (iii)\nestablishment of credit rating agencies. New laws have been promulgated to prohibit insider\ntrading,  regulate  stock  exchange  members,  and  offer  stock  options  to  employees.  The\nSecurities  and  Exchange  Commission  of  Pakistan  is  being  strengthened.  Reform  agenda\nincludes establishing a national clearing and settlement system, broadening the capital market\nbase by linking smaller cities, and developing internet-based trading.\n19. The banking reforms have not been extended to cover the specific needs of MF, which\ninclude (i) a conducive policy to encourage emergence of MFIs as depository institutions;14 (ii)\ncorresponding creation of a supervisory and regulatory system for orderly sector development;\n(iii) flexibility to adopt practices and procedures for banking with the poor, such as mobile\nbanking and group collateral; (iv) free limit to accumulate a noncollateralized loan portfolio; and\n(v)  insulation  from  political  interference.  The  MF  sector  can  seamlessly  integrate  with  the\nbroader financial sector if these are addressed.\n5. Suppliers of Microfinance\n20. The suppliers of MF services are (i) informal reciprocal arrangements; (ii) semiformal\nsources  such  as  NGOs,  the  Pakistan  Poverty  Alleviation  Fund  (PPAF),  and  Government-\nsponsored programs; and (iii) formal sources such as DFIs and CBs.\n                  \n12 Supported by the Banking Sector Adjustment Loan of World Bank.\n13 Loan 1576-PAK: Capital Market Development Program, for $250 million, approved on 6 November 1997.\n14 The entry threshold of PRs500 million ($9 million) is high for MFIs aspiring to become licensed depository\ninstitutions.", "6\na. Informal Sources\n21. Informal sources account for about 83 percent of the credit supply. Three principal\ninformal sources of credit are (i) commercially based credit linked with marketing intermediaries,\ncommission  agents,  village  traders,  and  shopkeepers;  (ii)  land-based  credit  arrangement\nextended by landlords to farmers for inputs and to meet consumption needs; and (iii) socially\nbased arrangements of friends and family (the most numerous). Money lending as a specialized\noccupation is not significant and gradually declining. Informal sources, both in rural and urban\nareas, mainly supply short-term credit at terms that reflect the weak bargaining power of the\npoor, particularly for land-based credit arrangements. Every village has one or more informal\ncommittees that collect regular savings and make loans to members. These operate like rotating\nsavings and credit organizations. Informal credit based on reciprocity and social obligations\nmainly  fund  urgent  consumption  needs  without  any  interest  charges.  However,  these  are\nintermittent and tend to be less than PRs1,000 ($18).\nb. Semiformal Sources\n22. The number of registered NGOs is estimated at 8,000 to 16,000, two thirds of which are\nin urban areas in inverse relation to population and poverty distribution. Most rural NGOs are\nsingle community or village-based groups registered as community-based organizations. Of the\n100 that seem to supply some MF, only half have outreach beyond the immediate community.\nThe nine members of the MF Group are considered to have substantive interest in MF. The\nNGOs providing MF can be broadly classified into three categories:\n(i)  Multisectoral  NGOs.  Engaged  in  a  variety  of  services:  education,  health,\ninfrastructure, and community development. These NGOs offer microcredit as a\nminor program component. MF is mostly funded by aid agencies.\n(ii)  NGOs with MF as core activity. Kashf Foundation and the Orangi Pilot Project\nhave MF as their main function; their combined outreach is about 3,000 active\nborrowers.\n(iii)  Rural support programs (RSPs). RSPs were established by the Government\nas independent nonprofit organizations. Of the nine RSPs,15 NRSP is the largest\n(Appendix 5) with nationwide coverage. Some RSPs have received endowments\nfrom the Government and funding agencies. RSPs undertake the formation of\ncommunity  organizations  (COs)  as  the  building  blocks  of  their  participatory\nholistic rural development model. The COs (self-help groups, village groups, and\nwomen groups) are the means to organize communities, create awareness, build\ncapacity, develop human resources, and instill credit discipline. Services include\n(a)  construction  of  productive  community  infrastructure,  (b)  microcredit,  (c)\nagriculture  extension,  and  (d)  training.  These  also  serve  as  incentives  for\ncommunities to organize. RSPs have formed 16,295 COs with a total of 446,820\nmembers in 55 districts, trained 107,024 social organizers, and undertaken 5,114\nphysical infrastructure schemes.\n23. Generally, MF operations of NGOs are sensitive to the demand profile and social needs\nof the poor, and provide services in a participatory manner. The published combined outreach of\n                  \n15 The major regional RSPs are the Punjab RSP, Sarhad Rural Support Corporation, and the Balochistan RSP,\nalthough the latter is almost dormant.", "7\nmembers of the MF Group is 61,400 borrowers with aggregate loans outstanding of PRs1 billion\n($18 million), and 417,000 depositors with savings of PRs685 million ($12 million). Women\nborrowers account for 11 percent of the total, even though women\u2019s groups represent 25\npercent of COs. The RSPs account for nearly 95 percent of NGO outreach.\n24. NGOs deliver MF services through group-based methodology, more commonly known\nas the Grameen Bank (Bangladesh) model with adaptations to suit the local context. The\nprevalent MF delivery model includes (i) CO formation; (ii) social preparation for the poor,\nincluding numeracy and skills training; (iii) regular meeting of COs; (iv) savings mobilization16\nand loan disbursement after the approval of a majority of members; and (v) peer pressure to\nensure proper credit behavior. Loans of $45-$1,250 (PRs2,520-PRs70,000) are given for terms\nranging from 3 months to 2 years, and repayments are usually monthly or quarterly. Incentives\nfor repayments are common. Individual loans are also provided in some cases. Pricing of loans\nare in terms of markup17 over the principal at 18-20 percent. This is above the CB markup\ncharges, but below the transaction cost and expenses incurred for social intermediation. Some\nNGOs charge up to 48 percent. Most NGOs are unable to meet their costs, and use grant\nsupport to bridge their income gap. Loan repayments are reportedly high (90 to 97 percent of\ndemand) in most cases.\n25. The Government established PPAF in 1997, with an endowment of PRs500 million ($9\nmillion), as an apex institution to help the poor. PPAF plans to provide MF services primarily\nthrough NGOs to an estimated 200,000 households over the next 4 years. Outreach is lower\nthan expected, as most NGOs need to be reoriented as  MF service providers.\n26. Credit components in Government-sponsored programs18 are not microcredit either by\nsize, mode of delivery, or terms of credit. The overall impact has been minimal as the services\nhave been presented, promoted, and delivered in a manner that suggests a politically motivated\ngrant facility and has been so understood by those privileged to have access. The budgetary\nsupport for such programs has either been curtailed or discontinued.\n  c.  Formal Sources\n27. The Federal Bank for Cooperatives (FBC) is an apex organization for six provincial\ncooperative banks. Of the 66,000 primary societies, 30,000 are active, with a membership of 3.5\nmillion. They had outstanding loans totaling PRs5 billion ($89 million) at the end of 1998 in\n58,000 borrower accounts averaging PRs86,200 ($1,540) per account; 27,369 loan accounts\nwere for PRs25,000 ($445) or less. While these are small loans, the loan terms and delivery\nmethodology exclude access by the poor, particularly poor women. Loans are secured against\nmortgages on agricultural land and the dominant land-owning class captures most of the loans.\n28. The  Agricultural  Development  Bank  of  Pakistan  (ADBP)  provides  two  thirds  of  the\nagricultural credit available in the country through its 49 regional offices, 349 branch offices, and\nmobile credit offices. During 1998/99, ADBP disbursed PRs30 billion ($535 million) to 451,992\nborrowers or 9 percent of the total 5.1 million farmers. Lending is collateral based. ADBP does\nnot cater to the poor except under special programss. Of the 0.953 million landless farmers,\n                  \n16 Deposited in CB, as NGOs are not depository institutions.\n17    As required under Islamic banking. Please refer to para. 40.\n18 Including (i) Self-employment Program, (ii) Youth Investment Promotion Society, (iii) Provincial Small Industries\nCorporation, (iv) Awami Tractor Scheme, and (v) Yellow Cab Scheme.", "8\n19,576 or 2 percent received loans.19 Interest rates for loans to individuals are set at 14-16\npercent per annum\n29. CBs have not expanded into MF on any scale except for experiments by the Bank of\nKhyber, Bank of Punjab, First Women\u2019s Bank, Habib Bank, Muslim Commercial Bank, and\nNational Bank of Pakistan. These are patterned on NGOs and almost entirely restricted to urban\nareas.  CBs  have  generally  regarded  MF  as  a  social  obligation  to  be  cross-subsidized  by\ncommercial operations.\nC. Constraints and Issues\n30. With an outreach of less than 5 percent of poor households, affordable MF services are\nnot available to the majority of the poor; thus they are unable to participate in the local economy.\nThe outreach of the NGOs is expected to grow to 400,000 households (currently about 60,000)\nby the end of 2004.20 Therefore, in the absence of complementary or alternative arrangements,\nthe MF market will remain grossly underserved, and its poverty reduction potential largely\nunrealized in the medium to long term. For this potential to be realized, the following constraints\nand issues must be addressed.\n1. Social\na. Inadequate Access of the Poor to Services\n31. Inadequate access to productive resources and social services has resulted in low\nindicators of well-being and lack of employment opportunities. This situation is compounded in\nrural areas where access is even more difficult due to inadequate or complete lack of basic\ninfrastructure. Low skill level and absence of support for human resource development for the\npoor prevents them from diversifying their household income. Government interventions have\nnot yielded the desired impact due to inadequate emphasis on community-based participatory\napproaches. Resource availability relative to the requirements for the social sectors is low.\nMuch of the investment required is for public services where private sector investments are\nunlikely. Without these services, MF will have less than the intended impact.\nb. Obstacles for Microfinance Outreach to Women\n32. Social intermediation costs to enhance women\u2019s access to MF are significantly higher in\nPakistan  as  constraints  on  mobility,  social  interaction,  and  skills  development  must  be\naddressed on a sustained basis. Although returns from social intermediation in terms of social\ncapital  and  demonstrative  effects  are  high,  investments  are  limited  due  to  high  cost.\nConsequently, the gender orientation of organizations, products, and delivery mechanisms is\ninsufficient to enhance outreach to women. Inadequate social preparation adversely affects\ngroup cohesion, the quality of loan portfolio, and ultimately the sustainability of MF operations.\nc. Absence of Risk Mitigation Measures\n33. The disadvantages of the poor households include lack of access to financial services,\nunfair terms of participation in the local economy, and vulnerability to economic and physical\ndownturns. Poor households forego potentially viable technologies, production choices, and\n                  \n19 ADBP has 153,413 loan accounts of PRs25,000 ($445) or less; many of these are doubtful debts.\n20  Including the projected outreach through PPAF assistance.", "9\nincome opportunities due to risk aversion. Mechanisms to mitigate such risks are not available.\nIn addition, the poor have no means to secure the safety of their savings, unless deposited with\nCBs, to which the poor have little access.\n2. Financial\na. Microfinance-Specific Policy Framework\n34. In  the  early  stages  of  MF  sector  development,  a  conducive  policy  environment  is\nrequired to encourage innovations and to allow a diverse set of institutions to provide a range of\nservices, particularly savings, in a supervised and regulated environment. The required policy\nattributes include (i) promotion of institutions that can target the poor with adequate gender\nemphasis, (ii) acceptance of individuals as well as groups of individuals for MF transactions, (iii)\nmechanisms to ensure that social intermediation precedes and accompanies MF services, (iv)\nsignificant  investments  in  social  intermediation,  (v)  pro-poor  financial  innovations  such  as\nmeasures to mitigate risks faced by the poor, (vi) realizing public-private sector synergy, (vii)\nautonomy in pricing and client selection, (viii) measures to integrate MF with the financial\nsystem (para.19), and (ix) proactive role of SBP in developing the MF sector.\nb. Institutional Limitations\n35. The  financial  reforms  have  put  in  place  a  policy  framework  for  efficient  financial\nintermediation that enables institutions to concentrate on their core competencies. For the CBs\nand DFIs, this core competency is serving the upper and middle segments of the market. While\nthe banking system has responded positively to the reform initiatives, an efficient and financially\nsound system, barring select institutions, has yet to emerge. The high level of nonperforming\nloans  attributed  to  slack  industrial  activity  is  widespread.  Some  institutions  have  capital\nadequacy below the prescribed 8 percent of risk-weighted assets. Competitive pressures for\nproduct differentiation and cost reduction is increasing. Smaller institutions are not able to invest\nin new technology and a branch network to access low cost retail deposits to gain competitive\nadvantage. The banking system is becoming concentrated in a few large institutions.\n36. MF is unlikely to become a significant part of CBs\u2019 portfolios. Operating procedures of\nCBs are incompatible with the requirements of banking with the poor, and thus their services\nand delivery mechanisms have excluded the poor. Women have been virtually excluded from\ninstitutional credit. In addition, CBs are undergoing reforms that include closing loss-making\nbranches,  downsizing,  recapitalizing,  and  implementing  measures  to  recover  and  write-off\nnonperforming loans. The CB\u2019s priorities therefore are restructuring and reorganization. Slow\ntransformation  of  DFIs  into  efficient  financial  intermediaries  due  to  their  overt  political\nconsiderations in business decisions and persistent poor governance, particularly of ADBP and\nFBC, underlines constraints to change and undermines the development of the rural financial\nsystem. For these reasons, MF has been perceived as high risk and unprofitable in Pakistan.\nConsequently, potential suppliers have avoided entry into MF.\n37. FBC (para. 27) channels funds to provincial cooperative banks at an interest rate of\nabout 2 percent per annum; they in turn onlend to societies and members at a markup to yield\n14-16 percent per annum. This increases the transaction cost of the system and serves as a\ndisincentive for deposit mobilization. FBC serves no justifiable financial intermediation role and\nreflects an arrangement that is contrary to the direction of ongoing financial sector reforms.\nMany  societies  are  fictitious,  loans  bogus,  accounting  procedures  inadequate,  and  low", "10\nrepayment  rates  a  persistent  problem.  Women\u2019s  cooperatives  have  been  systematically\nexcluded from credit and training programs through FBC.\n38. The persistent poor loan repayment record (60\u201370 percent) has eroded the fund base of\nADBP (para. 28). Annual accounts for 1999 still record a profit, largely because loan losses\nwere underestimated and standard income recognition norms were disregarded.21 Deposits are\nonly 2 percent of total liabilities. The organizational structure and institutional orientation as a\ncollateral-based  lending  institution  for  agriculture  is  not  consistent  with  the  participatory\ncommunity-based MF lending for farm and nonfarm activities.\n39. NGOs have small credit operations with no MF specialization. NGOs do not have the\ntrained staff, financial systems, and, until recently, have not seen the necessity of following\nsuccessful practices and procedures. Good governance is a growing concern. Even among the\nmembers of the MF Group, 7 have yet to achieve financial viability. Inadequate investment in\nsocial intermediation has also affected portfolio quality.\nc. Islamic Banking\n40. Islamic banking is practiced in Pakistan for transactions between banks and clients,\nincluding MF services. Markup over the principal and service charge are applied, as interest is\nprohibited under Sharia (Islamic Law). The revenue under this mode has been higher for\nlenders compared with the interest-based system. Recently, the Supreme Court of Pakistan\nruled that markup and service charges are applicable only when actual commodity or assets\nchange  hands  and  the  supplier  is  the  financier.  A  Commission  on  Transformation  of  the\nFinancial System has been set up to prepare operating guidelines. This may require systemic\nchanges affecting all financial institutions and will require adjustments to operating procedures.\nIn the meantime, MF services consistent with Islamic banking norms are already being provided\nand related training programs conducted.\n3. Services\n41. Delivery of financial services to the poor, particularly in rural areas is constrained by low\npopulation density in some provinces, inadequate communication services, small loans, and low\nhousehold  savings  that  increase  transaction  costs.  Seasonality  of  the  agriculture  business\ncycle, the main occupation for poor households, and the high probability of risks add to the\nproblems of providing MF services to the rural poor. In addition, while security of savings is a\nprime concern for rural households, secure savings facilities are not accessible. CBs find it\ncostly to cater to small depositors. Savings through NGO intermediaries, deposited with CBs,\nare generally compulsory and do not necessarily provide the maximum return to the depositor.\nNGOs cannot deploy such savings as microcredit.\nD. Government Objectives and Strategy\n1. Poverty Reduction\n42. The Government\u2019s goal of poverty reduction is to be realized through a comprehensive\napproach  that  takes  into  account  the  interactions  of  economic  social  and  governance\ndimensions. The approach is outlined in the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (IPRSP).\n                  \n21 PCR: PAK 19120: Second Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan Project (Loan Nos. 810 and 811), March\n1997.", "11\nExpenditure and budgetary allocations for poverty reduction measures have been enhanced\n(para. 65). The poverty alleviation program of the Government has five elements: (i) small\ninfrastructure projects, (ii) social safety nets, (iii) food support program, (iv) improving social\nindicators, and (v) expanded access to MF and skills development services through grassroots\norganizations such as NGOs and village organizations. Greater private sector involvement in\npoverty reduction is envisaged. The Social Action Program Phase-II (from January 1997 to June\n2002) aims to improve access to basic social services like primary education, primary health\ncare,  population  welfare  services,  potable  water,  sanitation,  and  middle  schooling.  The\nGovernment has also responded to growing unemployment, with a series of schemes including\nthe mass Self-employment Program.22 The incidence of poverty is to be reduced from 33\npercent of the population to a target level of 15.2 percent by end 2008.\n2. Microfinance Sector Development\n43. To enhance outreach of MF, the Government has adopted a comprehensive approach23\nto address issues and constraints through (i) a conducive policy framework, (ii) appropriate\nsupervisory and regulatory infrastructure, (iii) institutions capable of outreach to the poor, and\n(iv) investments in social intermediation and basic infrastructure. The Government also plans to\nrestructure DFIs. Emphasis will be placed on good governance, sustainability, public-private\npartnerships, community-based service delivery through NGOs, pro-poor focus, and gender\nconcerns. This strategy complements the efforts of the PPAF and other MF suppliers, and\nprovides the basis for a concerted effort to enhance outreach in a grossly underserved market.\n3. Gender Development\n44. Gender focus will be emphasized in the strategies and underlying activities in various\nGovernment programs. A permanent commission on the status of women has been formally\nannounced to protect women's rights. The IPRSP also recognizes the gender dimension of\npoverty and proposes reform of discriminatory laws and measures to coordinate policies. Within\nthe IPRSP framework, a review and modification of economic and social policies to incorporate\ngender perspectives is planned. Strengthening of gender focal points in federal and provincial\nwomen development departments and identification of targets for the implementation of the\nNational Action Plan (Ministry of Women Development) have been envisaged.\nE. External Assistance to the Sector\n45. The Poverty Alleviation Fund Project ($90 million) funded by the World Bank is the first\nmajor external assistance in the MF sector (para. 25). The project provides (i) onlending support\n($45 million) at 6-8 percent for microcredit to eligible organizations, (ii) grants on a cost-sharing\nbasis for community infrastructure projects ($28 million), (iii) grant ($10 million) for capacity\nbuilding of communities and partner organizations, and (iv) institutional development grant ($7\nmillion) for PPAF. At full implementation, outreach could extend to 200,000 poor households.\n46. Bilateral funding agencies and international NGOs are involved in microenterprise and\nNGO development. Their assistance includes (i) capacity building for NGOs; (ii) organizing\ncommunities; (iii) small grants as seed capital for MF; (iv) support for income generation,\n                  \n22  The Small Business Finance Corporation and Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency, spearheading\nthe employment programs, granted loans of PRs12 billion ($214 million) to 157,162 unemployed persons by June\n1998, which, according to estimates, resulted in the creation of 397,129 jobs. Other financial institutions including\nCBs have also participated in the program.\n23  As part of the MSDP.", "12\nempowerment of women, and poverty reduction through NGOs; (v) business advisory services\nfor small enterprises; (vi) expansion of the MF portfolio of CBs; and (vii) support for MF under\nrural  development  projects.  Major  development  agencies  are  the  Swiss  Agency  for\nDevelopment Cooperation, Department for International Development of the United Kingdom,\nNetherlands Development Assistance, Canadian International Development Agency, and three\ninternational  NGOs:  NOVIB  (Netherlands),  Asia  Foundation  (United  States),  and  Trust  for\nVoluntary  Organizations  (United  States).  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  is\nplanning to introduce the MicroStart Program to provide TA to MFIs.\n47. External assistance to the sector (Appendix 6) has (i) introduced successful practices;\n(ii) supported social intermediation; (iii) enabled selected NGOs to deliver MF services; (iv)\nprovided onlending support; (v) heightened gender concerns; (vi) established NGO networks\n(MF Group); and (vii) introduced new products, e.g., leasing. All have had a positive impact on\nthe sector. However, to catalyze the development of the MF sector significant interventions and\ninvestments  are  required  for  (i)  enhanced  outreach,  (ii)  social  intermediation,  and  (iii)\nsustainability of benefits, within a conducive policy framework.\nF. ADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n48. The country operational framework for Pakistan, 1999-2000, links poverty reduction to\nsocial services, agriculture and rural development, MF, development of social infrastructure,\nreforms in finance and industry sectors, and good governance. Specific measures such as\nbetter targeting, improved rural financial policies, and enhanced access to financial services\nhave been emphasized for greater poverty reduction impact.\n49. ADB\u2019s overarching goal is poverty reduction.24 The poverty reduction strategy outlines\npro-poor sustainable economic growth, social development, and good governance as its three\npillars. Agriculture and rural sectors are also emphasized, as the majority of the poor live in rural\nareas.  The  poverty  reduction  strategy  considers  MF  to  have  the  potential  to  increase  the\nphysical capital of the poor, while simultaneously building human and social capital. Emphasis is\nplaced on policy reforms, sustainable institutions, and effective monitoring. ADB\u2019s private sector\nstrategy25 emphasizes enhanced private sector contributions to poverty reduction by creating\nenabling  conditions,  generating  business  opportunities,  and  catalyzing  private  investments\nthrough public and private sector operations. Operational priorities include efficient financial\nintermediation and public-private synergy.\n50. The goal of ADB\u2019s MF strategy26 is to ensure permanent access to institutional financial\nservices for the majority of the poor and the purpose is to support an MF system that can\nprovide  diverse  services  of  high  quality.  The  strategy  focuses  on  (i)  creating  a  policy\nenvironment  conducive  to  MF,  (ii)  developing  financial  infrastructure,  (iii)  building  viable\ninstitutions,  (iv)  supporting  pro-poor  innovations,  and  (v)  supporting  social  intermediation.\nEmphasis is placed on designing projects in close consultation with stakeholders, including\npotential clients, to ensure that assistance is client-focused, demand-driven, and appropriately\npriced and delivered. Support to viable institutions that can set in motion such a process has\nbeen emphasized, along with reform of DFIs that continue to undermine the MF sector.\n                  \n24  R179-99: Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian Development\nBank, 19 October.\n25 R78-00: Promoting the Private Sector to Support Growth and Reduce Poverty: Private Sector Development\nStrategy, 9 March.\n26 R106-00: Finance For the Poor: Microfinance Development Strategy, 16 May.", "13\nG. Lessons Learned\n51. The MSDP will be ADB\u2019s first experience with a sector development approach for MF.\nWhile the MSDP primarily builds on the lessons learned in Pakistan, it also draws on the\nexperience of countries with mature MF sectors and adapts the same to Pakistan context.\n1. ADB\u2019s Microfinance Experience\n52. Community-based  multisectoral  area  development  programs  supported  by  ADB27  in\nPakistan have made a positive contribution to poverty reduction. MF components under these\nprojects support outreach extension through credit lines and grants to support transaction costs\nfor service provider NGOs, which act as subcontractors to mobilize communities, their core\nstrength.  ADB  also  supported  linkages  between  CBs  and  NGOs,  with  the  CBs  providing\nfinancial services to communities mobilized by NGOs. However, outreach could have been\nhigher with greater commitment of CBs to banking with the poor. Lessons learned by ADB in\nimplementing MF projects or projects with MF components in other countries indicate that (i)\ndemand for savings is high, even higher than for credit; (ii) access to services compatible with\nrequirements of the poor is important; (iii) a diverse range of institutions is required to enhance\noutreach; (iv) institutional viability is important to provide permanent access; (v) institutional\nstrengthening  needs  are  significant;  and  (vi)  social  intermediation  support  for  the  poor  is\nimportant to enable them to benefit from access to MF services.\n2. Successful Practices\n53. Successful practices in Pakistan emphasize that MFIs should (i) appropriately price\nproducts and services; (ii) mobilize a substantial amount of deposit funds from within serviced\ncommunities,  and  along  with  borrowings,  transform  these  into  loans;  (iii)  adopt  innovative\nstructures and practices that encourage proximity to communities and enable handling of large\nnumbers of customers; (iv) implement inexpensive administrative and operating procedures;\nand (v) provide incentives to staff to encourage good performance. Institutional autonomy, good\ngovernance, and professional management are prerequisites. Outreach to the poor is greater\nwith  effective  targeting,  greater  commitment  to  attain  a  viable  scale  of  operation,  and\nappropriate pricing of services.\n3. Providing Access to Women\n54. Social  intermediation  and  access  to  basic  infrastructure  should  precede  as  well  as\naccompany MF services, especially when aimed at women. MF projects targeting poor women\nin Pakistan suggest that (i) MFIs need to hire female staff; (ii) staff must mobilize savings and\nservice loans where women live and/or work; and (iii) women benefit from participation in\nsolidarity groups and skills development. Substantial efforts are required to develop groups in a\nparticipatory  manner  so  that  they  can  become  conduits  for  delivering  social  services  and\nenhance the social and economic status of women. In the context of the overall status of CBs\nand DFIs (paras. 35-38), outreach to women cannot be achieved by downscaling operations of\nCBs and DFIs as they were not originally created for the poor.\n                  \n27 Loan 1467-PAK(SF): Bahawalpur Rural Development Project, for $38 million, approved on 26 September 1996;\nLoan 1531-PAK(SF): Dera Ghazi Khan Rural Development Project, for $36 million, approved on 4 September\n1997; and Loan 1672-PAK(SF): Malakand Rural Development Project, for $41 million, approved on 18 March\n1999.", "14\n4. Role of Government in Microfinance Sector Development\n55. The Government\u2019s interventions to strengthen the MF sector should complement the\nmarket and decrease over time, while private participation in the provision of financial services\nshould increase once the basic policy framework and key institutions are in place. International\nexperiences  show  that  to  develop  the  MF  sector,  priority  should  be  given  to  viability  of\noperations. Start-up initiatives require investment support as access to money markets will only\nmaterialize over the medium to long term. Targeting the poor requires complementary services\nsuch as infrastructure, skills development, and education, which can be offered by the NGOs or\nstate services in a participatory manner and coordinated with the delivery of MF services.\n5. Lead Institutions for Sector Development\n56. Experience of countries with a mature MF industry indicates that a lead institution is\nneeded  to  play  the  role  of  anchor  and  catalyst  to  generate  momentum  for  growth,  and\nencourage investments and institutional diversity.28 The Grameen Bank in Bangladesh started\nunder a special charter of the government that provided the flexibility to meet the demand for\nMF. The success of Grameen Bank led to worldwide replication as a means to reach the\nexcluded. The increasing number of replicators led to growth in demand for basic supporting\ninfrastructure for MF training, audit, and credit rating. The Unit Desa system in Bank Rakyat\nIndonesia was created with government seed capital to provide a full range of financial services.\nBecause Unit Desas attained economies of scale and introduced efficient modes of operations,\nthey encouraged other intermediaries to expand activities in rural areas.\n6. Supervision and Regulation for Microfinance\n57. The opening of the MF sector under an omnibus legal and regulatory framework requires\nprudence and due diligence. This is best undertaken with corresponding capacity enhancement\nof the central bank, establishment of self-regulating organizations wherever necessary, and\nmaturity of the MF industry. The degree and appropriate form of regulation within the framework\ndepends on the size, ownership structure, and nature of the institutions. Overstretching the\nlimited supervisory capacity of the central bank and the costs involved are major concerns.\nInitially, institutions with sufficient operational flexibility for banking with the poor should be\nallowed entry on a selective basis subject to fairly intensive supervision by the central bank to\nprotect the interests of the poor. A broader framework is then developed under which diverse\ninstitutions  can  operate.  This  graduated  approach  is  being  adopted29  for  flexibility  and  to\naccommodate innovations.\n                  \n28 Some of the other institutions supported under ADB-funded projects include: (i) Loan 1741-CAM (SF): Rural Credit\nand Savings Project: supported the establishment of Rural Development Bank (state-owned) to onlend to MFIs as\nwell as undertake limited retail lending operations; (ii) Loan 1650-NEP (SF): Rural Microfinance Project: supported\nthe establishment of Rural Microfinance Development Center (private-public partnership) as an apex for onlending\nand technical support to both state-owned and private sector intermediaries; (iii) Loan 1435-PHI (SF): Rural\nMicroenterprise Finance Project: supported the establishment of People\u2019s Credit and Finance Corporation (state-\nowned)  as  an  apex  agency  for  onlending  and  technical  support  to  both  state-owned  and  private  sector\nintermediaries; and (iv) Loan 1457-VIE (SF): Rural Credit Project: supported Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural\nDevelopment (state-owned) and People\u2019s Credit Fund (established under a special charter of the central bank with\ninitial seed capital support).\n29  (i)TA 3078-BAN: Establishment of Framework for a Sustainable Microfinance, for $800,000, approved on 29\nSeptember 1998; (ii) The Financial Intermediaries Act of 1999 was promulgated in Nepal to encourage NGOs to\nundertake MF after the establishment of five Grameen Bank Replicators under the Development Bank Act of 1995;\nand (iii) Framework for Sustainable MF is now being considered in Viet Nam, learning from the experience of the\nPeople\u2019s Credit Fund.", "15\nIV. THE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\nA.  Rationale\n58. While many factors contribute to poverty, its most obvious manifestation is insufficient\nhousehold income. Poor households are permanently in deficit or in debt. Evidence from many\ncountries has shown that access to and efficient provision of savings and credit facilities, along\nwith social intermediation, enables the poor to stabilize their income and consumption, manage\nrisks  better,  gradually  build  assets,  develop  microenterprises,  enhance  income-earning\ncapacity, and thus enjoy a relatively better quality of life.\n59. Currently served by informal arrangements and a few small NGO initiatives, the MF\nsector in Pakistan is unable to expand. MF services are provided on a very limited scale, and\nsavings at positive real interest rates for the poor are practically excluded. By borrowing at high\ninterest rates in informal markets the poor are trapped in low-risk, low-return investments, which\nin the long run, will widen income gaps. Due to lack of access to alternative affordable sources\nthe poor are unable to increase or diversify their household income. Together these have long-\nterm negative effects on consumption and asset buildup of the poor households.\n60. Institutions to bridge demand and supply gap for MF services do not yet exist in Pakistan\nowing to policy and legal gaps and the lack of a supportive financial infrastructure (paras. 19\nand 34). CBs, in general, are neither structured nor geared to extend their MF exposure beyond\nexperimental forays. CBs\u2019 restructuring priorities are downsizing and recovery of doubtful debts,\nwhich constitute a significant part of their loan portfolio. Most DFIs have numerous financial and\norganizational  issues.  Politicization  has  eroded  autonomy  and  good  governance,  and  the\npersistent poor loan repayment record has eroded the DFIs\u2019 fund base. CBs and DFIs primarily\ncater to the upper and middle segments of the financial markets, rural elite, and farmers with\nsizeable landholdings, rather than to the assetless poor.\n61. Social constraints to enhancing outreach include (i) social barriers affecting women\u2019s\naccess to MF, (ii) vulnerability of the poor to economic and physical downturns, and (iii) weak\nsocial preparedness for effective utilization of financial services. These are further exacerbated\nby institutions of governance that tend to exclude the poor, especially women, from the entire\ndecision making process. These have impeded the growth of the MF sector resulting in a\nmajority of the poor without access to affordable MF. The small number of poor households with\naccess to institutional MF are not assured of permanent access because of the limited retail\ncapacity and inadequate resource base of MF service providers.\n62. To realize the poverty reduction potential of MF, substantial continuing resources are\nrequired to meet the magnitude of demand. Efficient institutional and market mechanisms are\nneeded whereby funds can be sourced in the domestic market and supplemented by funding\nagencies. Funds need to be allocated efficiently through appropriately designed and priced\nservices to the poor for investment in agriculture and microenterprises in a profitable manner.\nTo accomplish this, an integrated package of policy, institutional development, capacity building,\nand outreach expansion is needed, along with strong commitment to pursue reforms. The sector\ndevelopment program modality has thus been chosen for facilitating the adoption of basic\nsectoral reforms to ensure that an adequate policy and institutional framework is in place to\noptimize investment lending. The MSDP includes a policy loan to support policy reforms and an\ninvestment loan to support sector investment to enhance outreach. By formalizing the linkages\nbetween policy and investment components the MSDP will yield considerable benefits in terms\nof fostering a long-term sector wide perspective for sustained poverty reduction efforts.", "16\n63. The Government considers MF as a subsector of banking. To continue initial gains\nderived from banking reforms, the Government, with ADB support, formulated a policy and\ninvestment package for the MSDP. The policy package provides:\n(i)  improved  financial  services  for  the  poor,  with  the  Government  providing  a\nsupporting  policy  and  institutional  framework  to  encourage  private  sector\nparticipation;\n(ii)  support for social intermediation in a participatory manner to enhance social\ncapital30 for the poor to enable them to take advantage of economic opportunities\nthrough accessible and affordable MF services; and\n(iii)  promotion of pro-poor institutions to provide immediate accessibility to financial\nand social services.\n64. With a supporting policy framework, sustainable outreach to the poor can be realized by\ncombining  social  and  financial  intermediation.  Investments  in  social  intermediation  and  to\nextend outreach will help realize the poverty reduction potential of MF. Support for institutional\narrangements that combine the development efforts of a range of institutions\u2014financial and\nnonfinancial\u2014will catalyze the development of a critical mass of MF services. This will attract a\nrange of retailers and also a range of organizations providing services to MFIs such as rating\nagencies and auditors (para. 56).\n65. The  Government  has  shown  commitment  for  poverty  reduction  (paras.  42-44).\nGovernment expenditures for poverty reduction measures was PRs67 billion ($1.2 billion) in\nFY2000, and the allocation for FY2001 is PRs83 billion ($1.5 billion), representing a growth of\n25 percent. This is about 12.5 percent of the total budgeted expenditure for FY2001 compared\nto 10.5 percent for FY2000. The bulk of the increase, PRs21 billion ($375 million), is for the\nIntegrated  Rural  and  Urban  Development  Program  for  rural  and  low-income  urban  areas.\nIncluded in the annual allocations for FY2001 are about PRs34 billion for the Social Action Plan,\nPhase II. For the entire duration of the Social Action Plan, Phase II (1997-2002) the outlay is\nPRs499 billion ($9 billion), of which funding agencies\u2019 assistance is envisaged at PRs101 billion\n(20 percent). The restructuring cost of DFIs; instituting mechanisms for social intermediation\nand risk mitigation; MFI supervision; and capitalization of MFIs involves substantial costs. To\nprovide access to all the poor households with one average size ($295) microcredit loan would\nrequire about $2 billion (para. 14) with an annual incremental requirement of $200 million,\nrepresenting larger loans in successive loan cycles.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n66. The sector objective is to reduce poverty. The purpose of the MSDP is to develop the\nMF sector to efficiently provide a range of affordable financial and social services to the poor,\nespecially women who disproportionately bear the burden of poverty. Services provided at\naffordable  prices  will  have  a  significant  poverty  reduction  impact  and  thereby  (i)  increase\nincomes  of  poor  households;  (ii)  enhance  outreach,  especially  to  women;  (iii)  build  social\ncapital; and (iv) reduce risks faced by the poor.\n                  \n30 In practice strengthening the social capital of the poor largely means increasing opportunities for their participation\nin the workings of the society where social cohesion is weak and poor suffer from systemic social exclusion.\nIncreasing economic opportunities and creating participatory institutions/mechanisms are required to enhance\nsocial  capital.  The  promotion  of  community  based  groups  to  undertake  MF,  health,  and  natural  resource\nmanagement is an important step in this direction.", "17\n67. The MSDP will encourage the adoption of policy actions aimed at developing the MF\nsector. These include (i) developing an enabling policy framework for MF development; (ii)\nfacilitating the establishment of the Microfinance Bank (MFB); (iii) developing a framework that\nincorporates legislative, supervisory, and regulatory aspects to promote institutional diversity in\nthe MF sector; (iv) establishing mechanisms that will enhance social capital; (v) piloting risk\nmitigation mechanisms for the poor as a safety net measure; and (vi) initiating measures to\nrestructure  DFIs.  To  leverage  policy  actions,  the  MSDP  will  direct  investment  to  facilitate\noutreach expansion, enhance social capital, and strengthen institutions.\n68. The  MSDP  is  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  IPRSP  (paras.  42-44)  and  ADB\u2019s\nstrategies for poverty reduction, development of MF, and the private sector. The Government\u2019s\napproach for MF sector development is consistent with the fundamental banking reforms (para.\n17). ADB's support for the MSDP is justified as the MSDP provides:\n(i)  a catalytic and lead role for the development of the MF sector by emphasizing\nsupportive policies and creating opportunities for private investors to enhance\nincome-generating opportunities for the poor;\n(ii)  a synergistic private-public mechanism to deliver affordable financial services to\na large number of poor households for a significant poverty reduction impact;\n(iii)  proactive  policies  and  mechanisms  for  sustained  investments  to  reverse  the\nfeelings  of  social  and  psychological  inferiority  and  foster  a  sense  of\nempowerment among poor to enhance social capital and mitigate risks through\nalliances with civil society and the private sector; and\n(iv)  complementarity  with  the  efforts  of  other  stakeholders,  including  NGOs,  in\nextending the frontiers of institutional MF in a grossly underserved market.\nC. Policy Framework and Actions\n1. Develop an Enabling Policy Framework for Microfinance Development\n69. Given  the  significance  of  MF  to  the  socioeconomic  context  of  Pakistan,  the  policy\ncomponent of the MSDP will focus on developing an enabling policy framework. As part of the\nMSDP  the  Government  has  committed,  in  consultation  with  stakeholders  and  in  light  of\ninternational experience (paras. 51-57), to an MF policy that\n(i)  encourages  emergence  of  MFIs  to  increase  outreach  to  the  poor  and  the\nexcluded, especially poor women;\n(ii)  recognizes the need to direct investments to build social capital and to mitigate\nrisks faced by the poor;\n(iii)  promotes  linkages  between  MFIs  specializing  in  financial  intermediation  and\nNGOs with core competency in social intermediation to provide financial and\nnonfinancial services to individuals, as well as groups;\n(iv)  promotes public-private partnerships and private sector initiatives, especially the\nenhanced role of NGOs; and", "18\n(v)  improves the profile of MF among policymakers, with SBP taking a proactive role\nin  establishing  financial  infrastructure  to  support  MF  development  and  in\nintegrating MF with the broader financial system.\n2. Facilitate Establishment of Microfinance Bank\n70. MFB was designed to implement the MF policy in response to the rising incidence of\npoverty, significant demand and supply gap, negligible institutional outreach, and disarray of\nDFIs. MFB is expected to be the lead institution to generate the momentum for the sector to\ngrow, and expected investments and institutional diversity to materialize (paras. 55-57). MFB is\npart of the policy matrix of the IPRSP.\n71. The objective of MFB (Appendix 7) is to provide sustainable MF services to the poor in\norder  to  reduce  poverty  and  promote  social  development  and  economic  justice  through\ncommunity building and social mobilization. MFB was established on 6 August 2000 as a\nprivate-public31 institution with paid-up capital of PRs1.7 billion ($30 million) subscribed by 16\nCBs; 13 private sector CBs, including 2 foreign CBs (Citibank and Standard Chartered Bank),\nand 3 state-owned CBs. Investors have selected the eight-member board of directors. The\nchairperson  is  an  independent  director  from  the  NGO  sector  and  a  well  known  poverty\nspecialist, and the president is a banking professional with MF experience. Three directors,\nincluding two women, are independent directors from the NGO sector. Two directors are from\nprivate banks, including one from a foreign bank, and another two from the state-owned CBs.\n72. While observing successful MF practices (paras. 53-54), MFB will provide affordable\nservices, including savings, credit, leasing, money transfer, and risk mitigation. MFB combines\nthe development efforts of a range of service institutions in a synergistic and catalytic manner.\nNGOs will undertake social intermediation, and financial services will be provided primarily by\nMFB,  but  also  through  NGO  service  providers.  MFB  will  adopt  an  in-house  management\nstructure to reduce transaction costs. Forty percent of MFB staff and 40 percent of the clients\nwill be women. Service delivery methodology and products will have a strong gender bias. MFB\nwill work in partnership with NRSP, the largest NGO in the country by taking over, in phases, its\nMF portfolio comprising about 45,000 active borrowers in 1,900 COs and 50 staff. Outreach is\nprojected to be 560,000 borrowers32 in year six as a result of mobilizing new COs, and from the\npotential MF clients from the half a million poor already mobilized in COs by the NGO sector.\n73. Among the financial institutions in Pakistan, MFB has the most elaborate rules for good\ncorporate governance. MFB statute ensures that Government servants or politicians cannot be\nappointed to its board of directors. The statute insulates MFB from political interference as the\nboard and SBP are entrusted to decide on all matters. MFB rules adopted by MFB's board of\ndirectors, after SBP approval, institutionalize appointment of independent directors from the\nNGO sector. MFB rules also include (i) more stringent provisions than the ordinary company law\nfor dealing with transactions in which a director has an interest; (ii) express descriptions of\nduties of directors, including independent directors, obligating each director to act in the interest\nof all shareholders; (iii) requirement for an audit committee comprising majority independent\ndirectors to appoint the auditors, submit a separate annual report to shareholders, and fix\nremuneration of all staff including management; and (iv) provisions for greater transparency by\n                  \n31 MFB will be a majority private-owned bank as two of the three state-owned CBs are listed for divestiture.\n32  For comparison, the Association for Social Advancement (Bangladesh) had one million borrowers within 7 years\nof microcredit operations. This was achieved in the presence of and in competition with established MFIs such as\nthe Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee and the Grameen Bank. The People\u2019s Credit Fund (Viet Nam)\nhas been able to mobilize nearly 800,000 members within 8 years of establishment.", "19\nallowing independent directors access to all records, and provision of timely information to\nshareholders. In addition, SBP has put in place a specific supervisory and regulatory framework\nthat sets operational parameters that MFB must meet on an ongoing basis.\n3.  Develop a Framework for Institutional Diversity in the Microfinance Sector\n74. As part of the MSDP, the institutional design and financial infrastructure created to\nsupport  MFB  will  be  used  as  a  basis  to  develop  a  framework\u2014legal,  supervisory,  and\nregulatory\u2014to mainstream the attributes of the basic MF policy. The framework scope includes\n(i)  definition  and  categorization  of  MF  service  providers  into  categories  of  MFIs  and  their\nlicensing procedures; (ii) corresponding supervision and regulation standards and systems,\nincluding self-regulation; (iii) disclosure and reporting requirements; (iv) appropriate adjustment\nfor entry threshold prescribed under the banking laws to enable entry of MFIs as licensed\ndepository institutions; and (v) foreclosure and dispute resolution mechanisms. As a matter of\ndue diligence prior to opening up the sector to a diverse range of institutions the development of\nthe enabling framework is sequenced (para. 57) after the dedicated systems for MFB are\noperational and the supervisory capacity of SBP is enhanced. Once finalized and adopted, the\nframework  will  also  be  made  applicable  to  MFB,  as  necessary.  Small  licensed  MFIs  are\nexpected to emerge after the framework is adopted. These MFIs could break-even within 4-5\nyears of start-up and reach 20,000-30,000 clients over 10 years. MFB is expected to be a\nstrategic investor in these small MFIs.\n75. SBP has established a Microfinance Support Division reporting to the executive director.\nThe Microfinance Support Division has a Microfinance Policy Unit and a Consultative Group.\nThe  Consultative  Group,  represented  by  stakeholders,  will  serve  as  an  advisory  body  in\ndesigning the framework and outlining the manner in which it will be adopted, possibly through\nan omnibus legislation or amendments of existing statutes.\n4. Establish Mechanisms for Enhancing Social Capital\n76. As part of the MSDP, the Microfinance Social Development Fund (MSDF) (Appendix 8)\nwas established in SBP for intensive and sustained support for promotion of COs and capacity\nbuilding for the poor, especially women, to effectively utilize MF services. The revenue earned\nfrom MSDF will meet defined social preparation costs associated with community mobilization,\nskills development, social awareness, basic numeracy skills, and selection and management of\nIGAs  for  about  560,000  poor  organized  in  about  24,750  COs.  MSDF  will  fund  women\u2019s\nempowerment through training in community management, capacity enhancement for specific\nidentified skills, and leadership management. The duration of MSDF is for 25 years and the\nminimum outlay is $40 million equivalent to generate sufficient revenues to support social\ndevelopment needs of the expected clients. The Government will contribute the bulk of the\nfunds required. MFB has made an initial contribution and is mandated to set aside 10 percent of\nits net profit in terms of MFB Rules 2000 issued by SBP.\n77. To leverage the social mobilization through MSDF, the Community Investment Fund\n(CIF) (Appendix 9) was established in SBP, with a term of 25 years, to increase the access of\nthe  poor  to  basic  infrastructure  and  thus  improve  their  livelihoods  through  efficient  and\nproductive use of local resources. The involvement of COs in identifying, planning, executing,\nand monitoring community-based infrastructure subprojects will empower them and serve as an\nincentive to mobilize and strengthen COs. This will help expand the MF market and maintain\npeer pressure as a substitute for physical collateral. The minimum outlay of CIF is $20 million", "20\nequivalent and the Government will contribute the bulk of the funds. MFB has made an initial\ncontribution.\n78. MSDF  and  CIF  support  will  enhance  social  capital  by  creating  a  network  of  COs,\nstrengthening COs, increasing social and economic interaction among the excluded, influencing\nnorms of behaviors that govern interaction between genders, enhancing capacity and skills, and\nproviding opportunities for economic development. The fund mechanism provides a clear basis\nfor determining social costs associated with MF and has a built-in exit mechanism; as business\nvolume increases, MFB revenues will meet an increasing proportion of social costs. MSDF and\nCIF will be dedicated facilities for MFB for the first three years, licensed MFIs will be included\nthereafter, to ensure linkages and sequencing of investments to promote the MF sector. These\nfunds will be used only to provide services through NGOs, and nearly half the proceeds will be\ntargeted  at  poor  women.  The  scope  and  utilization  of  MSDF  and  CIF  will  be  reviewed\nperiodically in consultation with ADB.\n5. Pilot Risk Mitigation Mechanisms for the Poor as a Safety Net Measure\n79. As a safety net measure, the Risk Mitigation Fund (RMF) was established (Appendix 10)\nin SBP with initial MFB contribution. RMF\u2019s objective is to reduce risks associated with failed\nIGAs, both farm and non-farm, of MFB clients. RMF will assist MFB borrowers, not MFB per se,\nin case of loss of IGAs (acquired through MFB loan) due to unforeseen circumstances beyond\ntheir control. RMF is expected to mitigate risks faced by about 27,000 poor during the MSDP.\nAssistance from RMF will be provided using a community-based participatory process where 75\npercent of the CO members will approve assistance from RMF to any individual. Experience\nwith community-based risk mitigation mechanism gained by RMF will provide the basis for\nassessing the feasibility of actuarial-based insurance services for the poor.\n80. Although small in absolute amount, the value of the savings of the poor relative to their\nincome is considerable and therefore needs to be protected. MFB will be a deposit-taking\ninstitution, both from its (poor) borrowers and also from nonborrowers. Given substantial paid-up\ncapital  and  viable  operations,  no  immediate  deposit  guarantee  is  considered  necessary.\nHowever, as a matter of precaution, the Deposit Protection Fund (DPF) was established in SBP\nto partially secure the savings mobilized by MFB (Appendix 11).33 This will provide assurance to\nthe poor of the safety of their savings. At the end of year 6 the DPF balance is expected to be\nabout 50 percent of MFB deposits. SBP, in consultation with ADB, will explore the possibility of\nconverting DPF into an actuarial-based system.\n81. MFB will contribute a part of its net profit to RMF and DPF. In addition, the Government\nwill contribute the difference between the borrowing rate and the relending rate to RMF and\nDPF on a recurring basis. An initial contribution of $5 million is expected from the Government\nfor both RMF and DPF.\n6.  Initiate Restructuring of Development Finance Institutions\n82. To address deep-seated DFI problems, the Government prepared a DFI restructuring\nplan that includes downsizing, liquidation, merger, and privatization to ensure efficient allocation\nof resources. While DFI reform supports the objectives of the MSDP, the reform of ADBP and\nFBC, which currently serve the agriculture and rural sectors, is more significant because their\n                  \n33 Deposits of state-owned banks are implicitly guaranteed. No such cover is available for private sector banks. MFB\nwill be a majority private sector-owned bank during the MSDP.", "21\npolitically influenced operations act as deterrents to the entry of MFIs into the rural sector. The\nGovernment, as part of the MSDP, has decided to (i) initiate an irreversible process of closing\nFBC, (ii) provide severance pay to FBC staff, (iii) conduct a portfolio audit of ADBP, and (iv)\nprepare a restructuring plan for ADBP. In the meantime, the resource support from SBP to\nADBP or the provincial cooperatives, if any, has been indexed to the average rate of return on\nthe  Government  treasury  bills  to  ensure  financial  discipline  through  deposit  mobilization,\ndiligent credit appraisal, and better delinquency management.\n83. These measures will help extend the financial sector reforms to DFIs and set the stage\nfor reform interventions for ADBP and the cooperatives by ADB, other development agencies,\nand  the  Government.  The  rural  financial  markets  will  be  strengthened  by  the  reformed\ninstitutions leading to an increased inflow of resources from the banking system in rural areas\nas compared with the current net outflow of resources. Agriculture lending in Pakistan could\nincrease from the current level of 6.1 percent of agricultural GDP to 14-20 percent, as in other\nAsian countries.\nD. Capacity Building\n84. Inadequate managerial expertise to run MFB and MFIs and inexperience of SBP in the\nMF sector development indicate the need for capacity building interventions. These will be\naddressed by (i) providing TA to SBP to design and implement a policy framework including a\nsupervisory system appropriate to smaller MFIs; (ii) funding consulting services to help MFB\nestablish  operating  systems  and  procedures,  training  systems,  and  product  pricing  and\npromotion; identifying measures to improve social mobilization and enhancing the impact of\nservices on poverty reduction; and building a sound customer base; (iii) training CO members\nand  leaders;  and  (iv)  providing  assistance  to  new  MFIs  wishing  to  enter  the  MF  market.\nAssistance is also needed for equipment and vehicles to ensure the mobility of MFB\u2019s female\nstaff to reach out to poor women in remote areas.\nE. The Investment Project\n1. Objective and Scope\n85. The Project\u2019s objective is to leverage policy actions for a significant poverty reduction\nimpact.  Improvements  in  the  socioeconomic  status  of  the  poor,  especially  women,  will  be\nachieved by increasing investment, incomes, and employment. For this, support will be provided\nto expand outreach, enhance social capital, and strengthen institutions.\n86. The  Project  scope  includes  (i)  a  credit  line  of  $68  million  equivalent  to  support\ninvestments in farm and nonfarm IGAs; (ii) community organization and skills development, with\nspecial emphasis on women, and the provision of basic community infrastructure; and (iii)\ninstitutional strengthening of the implementing and executing agencies. This will result in (i)\nMFB  having  significant  and  sustainable  financial  service  outreach,  (ii)  strengthened  social\nservice  providers  with  significant  outreach  capabilities,  (iii)  demonstration  of  effective  and\nefficient financial and social service delivery systems, and (iv) framework to support institutional\ndiversity in the sector.\n87. Major financial features of the Project, include (i) a lending interest rate that ensures that\nthe bulk of the subproject income is left with poor households for consumption, asset buildup\nand  savings;  (ii)  a  lending  interest  rate  to  borrowers  that  will  meet  the  cost  of  financial\nintermediation; (iii) a relending rate to MFB pegged to encourage savings and commercial", "22\nborrowing;  (iv)  segregation  of  social  intermediation  and  financial  intermediation  costs;  (v)\nemphasis on savings to encourage the poor to save profitably in an accessible and secure\ninstitution; and (vi) a range of services, including leasing, delivered to communities. MFB, as an\nautonomous institution with a significant private sector stake, will ensure high standards of\ncorporate governance and efficiency. With equity investment from CBs, MFB will pursue a\ncommercially oriented path, which is needed to develop linkages with the financial sector,\naccess funds, and provide a broad range of financial services.\n88. Features to ensure that women have access to financial services are that (i) at least 40\npercent of the COs will be women-COs and 40 percent of MFB staff will be women; (ii) mobile\nunits with women staff will operate on a regular basis to disburse loans, attend to savings\nwithdrawals, and collect deposits and loan repayments; and (iii) MFB will work closely with local\nauthorities to expedite the processing of identity cards for women. With NGOs and women\nrepresented on the MFB board, social and gender aspects will be adequately addressed.\n89. The  assured  source  of  funding  from  MSDF  and  CIF  will  strengthen  civil  society\nnationwide with positive externalities, particularly those related to gender. Exclusive use of\nMSDF and CIF through NGO service providers with a defined participatory process (Appendix 8\nand Appendix 9) will ensure that social capital buildup with due emphasis on gender aspects\nprecedes as well as accompanies access to MF. The risk of poor households will be mitigated\nwith assistance from RMF (Appendix 10). DPF (Appendix 11) will provide a measure of security\nfor the savings of the poor. The Government bears the foreign exchange risk and directs the\nentire  project  investment  to  provide  unimpeded  and  sustained  assistance  to  the  poor.  All\ncounterpart funds will be provided as grants to MSDF, CIF, RMF, and DPF as the contribution of\nthe Government. In addition, the Government and MFB will make recurring contributions to RMF\nand DPF, and MFB will set aside 10 percent of its profit for social intermediation.\n2. Components\na. Outreach Expansion\n90. MFB will access a credit line of $68 million equivalent to finance the requirements of\nindividual subborrowers for farm and nonfarm IGAs to support the investment requirements of\n560,000 borrowers at the end of year 6. Forty percent of the potential clients will be women.\nTypical  activities  financed  include  farm  crops,  goat  rearing,  milch  cattle,  poultry,  cottage\nenterprises, small trading, rural transport, and mobile telephones, with an investment range of\n$150  to  $500.  The  estimated  investment  requirement  of  $166  million  will  be  funded  by\nsubborrowers ($25 million), ADB credit line, and the balance by MFB. The clients will be served\nby 7 control offices, 34 branches, and mobile units operated by 1506 staff.\n91. First-cycle borrowers of MFB will be those living below the poverty line. These borrowers\nare expected to cross the poverty threshold with successive cycles of microcredit and regular\nsavings. During project implementation, MFB will operate in 30 districts comprising 5 million\nhouseholds of which 2.8 million are poor, of which 1.74 million are very poor. Selection of\nbranch locations will be done through poverty classification of households with the assistance of\nlocal NGOs to identify and reach the poorest. MFB will follow the successful practice of using\nCOs to deliver services (Appendix 8, Figure A8) but will also give individual loans to borrowers\nwith  good  loan  records.  MFB  will  emphasize  savings,  initially  compulsory,  and  voluntary\nthereafter. The first cycle loans will not exceed $350. MFB will institute a full range of savings\nproducts and is expected to have about 80,000 nonborrower depositors by year six, in addition\nto the savings of 560,000 borrowers.", "23\nb. Social Capital\n92. 24,750 COs, comprising 560,000 households, will be organized  (Appendix 8) in a\nparticipatory manner through NGO service providers and will be the delivery points for social\nand financial services. Forty percent of the COs formed will be women COs. Capacity building\nof  members  (560,000)  at  the  community  level  will  include  training  on  topics  like  social\nawareness, community mobilization, empowerment of women, selection and management of\nIGAs, skills development, and basic numeracy. One activist (leader, organizer) from each CO,\nor a total of 24,750 activists will attend a 4-day community management skills training. To\nenhance the participation of women, 12,412 women activists will attend a 3-day activist capacity\nenhancement course.  Further, 10 percent of women activists or a total of 1,240 members will\nattend  a  10-day  leadership  management  skills  training  course.  In  addition,  annual  2-day\nworkshops for all CO activists will be held. In all, 1,409 workshops will be held during project\nimplementation. CO members will be trained in the villages. CO activist and women's leadership\ntraining will be conducted where NGO facilities are available.\n93. The formation and strengthening of COs will be contracted to NGOs (principally NRSP in\nthe first year), and a detailed participatory process will be followed. The process (Appendix 8,\nFigure A8) involves (i) selection of service areas, based on village surveys, that will provide the\neconomic and social profile of the village and enable a poverty ranking of households into\ndestitute, poor, near poor, and nonpoor; (ii) a description of MFB services and procedures at a\npublic meeting; (iii) identification of activists within the village who will assist in mobilizing future\nCO members; (iv) a group decision to form a CO, appoint the president, and a CO activist; and\nregister the CO with MFB; (v) training of the CO activist; (vi) holding of at least six meetings,\nusually at two-week intervals, during which CO members deposit savings in a CO account; (vii)\npreparation, by each member who wishes to borrow, of an investment plan, and agreement to\nthe loan size by at least 80 percent of members; (viii) appraisal and eventual loan decision by\nthe field officer of MFB; (ix) signing of the loan agreement by each borrower, witnessed by the\nCO president; and (x) disbursement of loan proceeds to borrowers.\n94. Grant financing for small-scale, community-level infrastructure subprojects (Appendix 9)\nthat benefit the poor will be provided on cost-sharing basis in underserved areas. Subprojects\nare mainly civil works including (i) roads and bridges to provide better access, (ii) farm irrigation\ninvestments,  (iii)  infrastructure  for  the  provision  of  clean  drinking  water,  (iv)  drainage  and\nsewerage, (v) schools, (vi) electrification, (vii) small information technology kiosks, and (viii)\npublic telephone offices. Approximately 4,500 subprojects will be financed with CO contributions\nmaking up 40 percent and the balance from the CIF interest revenue.\n95. The  participatory  process  (Appendix  9,  Figure  A9)  to  be  followed  for  CIF-funded\nsubprojects will involve (i) poor households identify infrastructure deficiencies, (ii) remedies are\ndiscussed with the service provider NGO during CO meetings, (iii) the CO with the help of the\nNGO prepares the investment plan, (iv) agreement of 80 percent of CO members is obtained,\n(v) the proposal is submitted to MFB, (vi) the CO deposits its share of cost with MFB, (vii) MFB\ndisburses CIF funds in the CO account, (viii) the NGO and CO jointly monitor subproject work\nand its completion, and (ix) the CO provides operation and maintenance of subprojects.\nc. Institutional Strengthening\n96. The focus of this component is on developing MFB\u2019s capacity to efficiently provide\nservices and developing SBP\u2019s capacity to take a proactive role in sector development. Training", "24\nof MFB staff will be provided using the Institute of Banking and Finance facilities in Islamabad.\nTraining materials will be developed with consultant assistance using materials available from\nNRSP  and  international  sources.  Support  will  be  extended  to  (i)  MFB  to  acquire  office\nequipment and vehicles to enhance outreach, especially to enable women staff to access poor\nwomen in remote areas; (ii) transformation of two NGOs into regulated MFIs; and (iii) portfolio\naudit of ADBP.\n3. Cost Estimates\n97. The investment Project is estimated to cost $217.2 million equivalent, comprising $50.0\nmillion (23 percent) in foreign exchange costs and $167.2 million equivalent (77 percent) in local\ncurrency costs (Appendix 12).\nTable 1:  Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nItem Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost\nA.

Financing Plan\n98. The Government has requested ADB to provide a loan of $80 million equivalent for the\ninvestment project. This represents 42 percent of the investment cost excluding CO formation,\ncapacity building of communities, and basic community infrastructure, which are funded by\nMSDF and CIF interest revenue. The loan proceeds and the SDF and CIF proceeds will finance\nthe entire foreign exchange component of the Project, including the interest charges during\nimplementation and part of the local currency cost, equivalent to $36.2 million. The provision of\nlocal currency cost is considered warranted from the perspective of the overall MSDP to ensure\nthat  sufficient  and  timely  funding  is  available  for  outreach  expansion  and  institutional\nstrengthening, thereby minimizing the risk of implementation delay. Country considerations\njustify the provision of local currency cost financing. Concerted efforts have been made to", "25\nmaintain domestic investment levels to sustain growth, but the country faces persistent budget\npressures, arising from the declining growth rates and fiscal imbalances during 1990s.\n99. The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation is preparing a feasibility study in\nconsultation  with  ADB  to  strengthen  SBP  capacity.  The  Department  for  International\nDevelopment of United Kingdom has also expressed interest in providing parallel support for\nMFB capacity building. Capacity building support to MFB is also expected from the MicroStart\nProgram being planned by the United Nations Development Programme.\nTable 2: Summary of Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total Percent\nExchange Currency Cost\nAsian Development Bank 43.8 36.2 80.0 37\nMSDF and CIFa 6.2 21.9 28.1 13\nMicrofinance Bank 74.1 74.1 34\nSubborrowers 30.3 30.3 14\nGovernment 4.7 4.7 2\nTotal 50.0 167.2 217.2 100\nNote: Figures may not add up to totals in Appendix 12 due to rounding.\nCIF=Community Investment Fund, MSDF=Microfinance Social Development Fund.\na Foreign exchange financed from proceeds of the policy loan.\n100. The use of low cost funds from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for outreach expansion\nis justified because MFB\u2019s access to money markets will materialize over the medium term and\ndeposit mobilization will build up gradually. Market borrowings will bear high premiums until\nMFB establishes a track record. The resulting high lending interest rate will affect consumption\nand asset buildup of the poor households. In addition, access to assured resources will enable\nMFB to implement its business plan for sustainability, strengthen its financial position, and attain\nviability as early as possible. Support for MFB\u2019s start-up and expansion costs provide the\npossibility  of  effecting  a  significant  poverty  reduction  impact.  The  low-cost  funds  enable\ncontributions to RMF, DPF, and support for social intermediation.\nF. Social and Environmental Measures\n1. Social Analysis\n101.  By addressing multiple dimensions of poverty, the MSDP will have a significant poverty\nreduction impact. The support for CO formation and strengthening will reinforce social capital,\nwhile helping members learn that they can save money, borrow and invest wisely, and gain\nsome  control  over  their  lives.  Initial  and  regular  deposits  will  solidify  commitment.  These\nopportunities are especially significant for women, who in the past have had little opportunity to\ninteract with institutions external to their community. Women's membership in COs will enable\naccess  to  savings,  credit,  and  social  services,  and  lead  to  greater  social  and  economic\nempowerment. The increased household income will enable the poor to provide better health\ncare for their families, send more children to school, provide for better nutrition, and accumulate\na cash buffer for small emergencies. Through their participation, NGOs will become more\neffective in working with communities leading to more opportunities for expansion and greater\npoverty reduction impact.", "26\n2. Environmental Measures\n102. The MFB will ensure that field officers and their supervisors are aware of environmental\nissues  associated  with  subborrower  investments.  This  will  be  achieved  through  (i)  an\nenvironment unit established at MFB head office to mainstream environment aspects, (ii) a\nmanual prepared on environment assessment of microcredit, (iii) inclusion of environmental\nawareness and assessment in the training courses for MFB staff, and (iv) environmental review\nof representative samples of subborrower investments during project reviews. In the field, when\nsubborrowers  discuss  their  proposed  investments  with  CO  members,  the  field  officers  will\nparticipate in the discussions to ensure members are aware of environmental aspects, and that\nthese are fully and satisfactorily taken into account in the eventual use of loan funds.\nV.   THE PROPOSED LOANS\nA.  The Policy Loan\n1. Amount of Loan, Terms, and Sources of Funds\n103. A loan of  $70 million equivalent will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to\nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan (the Borrower). The loan will have a term of 24 years, including\na grace period of 8 years. An interest of 1 percent per annum will be charged during the grace\nperiod, and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\n104. Use of low cost funds from ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources is justified in support of policy\nreforms that addresses politically sensitive long-standing issues and socially significant measures,\nto enhance outreach to the poor. The fundamental shift in the approach is reflected in terms of (i)\nsustainable banking; (ii) private sector entry in banking with the poor; (iii) instituting mechanisms\nfor social capital buildup, especially for enhancing outreach to women and their empowerment;\n(iv) introduction of community-based risk mitigation measures; (v) NGO involvement in MF sector\ndevelopment; (vi) autonomy of the sector, and (vii) reforms, including closure, of DFIs. Policies will\nlink social capital build up with access to MF through a broad coalition of public, private and social\norganizations. Private sector investment has been brought in MF while ensuring support for social\nsectors where continued and direct Government involvement is warranted. Socially, the policy has\nplaced women at positions to influence the direction of the sector development and will give\nopportunities to the poor to increase household income. For the first time, the poor will have\naccess to safe, liquid and, remunerative savings facilities. The policy actions are within the\nframework of the Government\u2019s IPRSP ensuring sustainability and commitment.\n2. Implementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\n105.  SBP will be the Executing Agency and will coordinate with the Ministry of Finance on\nthe  policy  reforms.  SBP  has  established  a  project  management  unit  (PMU)  within  the\nMicrofinance Support Division at SBP headquarters in Karachi (Appendix 13). The PMU will\nhave at least two full-time staff, and will oversee both the program and investment components.\nThe  Consultative  Group  consisting  of  a  broad  array  of  stakeholders  will  ensure  wider\nconsultation  on  MF  policy-related  matters.  The  PMU,  in  coordination  with  the  Ministry  of\nFinance, will submit semiannual progress reports to ADB on the progress and issues relating to\npolicy implementation.", "27\n3. Procurement and Disbursement\n106. The policy loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items\nproduced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding listed ineligible items (Appendix\n14). The Borrower will certify that (i) if the loan proceeds will finance goods already imported,\nthe value of eligible imports in the period concerned will exceed the amount of the requested\nwithdrawal; or (ii) if the loan proceeds finance items to be imported, the value of eligible imports\nin the immediately preceding one-year period will be equal to or greater than the amount of the\nrequested withdrawal plus all other amounts expected to be withdrawn during the succeeding\none-year period. An audit of the use of the loan proceeds will be undertaken only upon ADB\u2019s\nrequest, provided that ADB retains the right to (i) audit any account, and (ii) verify the validity of\nthe certification issued by the Borrower for each withdrawal application. Prior to withdrawal, the\nborrower will open a deposit account with SBP in which all withdrawals will be deposited. The\naccount will be managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to\nADB.\n4. Counterpart Funds\n107. The Government will use the counterpart funds for activities related to poverty reduction\n(paras. 42-44), among which social sectors and MF are key components. As part of the MSDP it\nhas been agreed that the Government will contribute the entire counterpart funds as a grant to\nMSDF ($40 million), CIF ($20 million), RMF ($5 million), and DPF ($5 million). The Government\nand ADB will monitor the use of counterpart funds.\n108. The precise and monitorable dedication of counterpart funds through explicit expenditure\ncommitments (i) supports ADB\u2019s strategic development objective for poverty reduction; and (ii)\nsupplements the policy reforms with measures to enhance social capital, which is the most\ndesirable and necessary use of resources in view of Pakistan\u2019s low social indicators.34 Social\nequity  is  thus  ensured  in  the  use  of  program  funds.  Use  of  counterpart  funds  outside  the\nGovernment budget structure and keeping it fully funded from the beginning to meet long-term\nrequirements is meant to (i) jumpstart the MF sector development, (ii) provide unimpeded support\nto stakeholders in enlarging the MF market, (iii) provide a nationwide basis for the NGOs to\nemerge as efficient social service providers, (iv) enable flexibility to adapt to changing sector\nrequirements, and (v) ensure effective targeting. The Government has also committed to make\nrecurring contributions and the MFB has been mandated to set aside part of its profit for social\nintermediation, risk mitigation, and deposit protection. The allocation of counterpart funds is in the\ncontext where resource requirement for poverty reduction is immense, and the Government has\nenhanced related spending by 25 percent in the budget for FY2001.\n109. Over 6 year period the revenue for MSDF, CIF, RMF, and DPF including the recurring\ncontributions are estimated to aggregate $50 million,35 or about $90 for each of the estimated\n560,000 MFB clients. Over 10 years, the aggregate revenue and recurring contributions will be\nabout $100 million thus providing a sustained basis for the poor to pursue social empowerment\nbeyond the project duration.\n                  \n34 1999 Human Development Index of the United Nations Development Programme ranks Pakistan 138th out of 174.\n35 Excluding the $70 million initial contribution from counterpart funds.", "28\n5. Monitoring and Tranching\n110. The  policy  loan  will  be  released  in  two  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of  $50  million\nequivalent  will  be  released  upon  loan  effectiveness.  For  the  MSDP  to  be  effective  the\nGovernment must initiate certain administrative and policy actions in advance of the first tranche\nrelease to demonstrate its commitment to the policy reform agenda. In recognition of this, the\nGovernment has (i) adopted an MF development policy; (ii) enacted an MFB ordinance as part\nof  the  MF  policy;  (iii)  facilitated  the  establishment  of  MFB  as  an  autonomous,  privately\nmanaged, and fully capitalized institution designed to work in partnership with NGOs and COs;\n(iv)  established  the  Microfinance  Support  Division  with  Microfinance  Policy  Unit  and\nConsultative Group on MF; (v) created MSDF, CIF, RMF, and DPF with specific rules and\ncontribution mechanisms as agreed with ADB; (vi) decided to close FBC and commenced\npayment  of  severance  pay;  and  (vii)  indexed  the  cost  of  resource  support  to  ADBP  and\ncooperatives with the Government treasury bills.\n111. As a matter of additional precaution, the Government, on its own initiative, has decided\nto amend the SBP Act 1956 to enable SBP to become the custodian of MSDF, CIF, RMF, and\nDPF. This will further strengthen autonomy and insulation from extraneous interference in the\nintended usage of these funds over the long-term. The amendment has been approved by the\ncabinet.\n112. ADB will undertake an interim review of the MSDP prior to the release of the second\ntranche.  The  second  tranche,  comprising  the  balance  of  the  policy  loan  of  $20  million\nequivalent, is expected to be released within 24 months of the effective date provided that (i) the\nframework  (para.  74)  to  enhance  institutional  diversity  in  the  MF  sector  is  prepared  in  a\nparticipatory manner, and adopted after ADB review, and SBP institutes a system to implement\nthe framework; (ii) the MFB ordinance is reviewed, and if required, amended to incorporate\nrelevant features of the framework in consultation with ADB; (iii) take irreversible steps for the\nclosure  of  FBC  and  finalize  and  implement  a  redundancy  plan,  acceptable  to  ADB,  that\nadequately  compensates  the  laid-off  employees  in  conformity  with  applicable  laws  and\nstandards; and (iv) the portfolio audit of ADBP is completed and options for ADBP\u2019s institutional\nstrengthening discussed and adopted in consultation with ADB.\n113. Reforms that are supportive for the MF sector but cannot be addressed in the present\nframework such as the reforms to address imperfections in land markets and land distribution;\ninefficiency in irrigation and marketing of agriculture produce; and special efforts for tribals and\nbonded labor, will be addressed through policy dialogue and follow-up interventions, provided\nMSDP objectives are met and outcomes achieved.\nB. The Investment Loan\n1. Amount of Loan, Terms, and Sources of Funds\n114. A loan of $80 million equivalent will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to\nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan (the Borrower). The loan will have a term of 32 years, including\na grace period of 8 years. An interest of 1 percent per annum will be charged during the grace\nperiod, and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.", "29\n2. Implementation Arrangements and Executing Agency\na. Project Management\n115. SBP will be the Executing Agency, through the PMU based in Karachi (para. 105). A\nproject implementation unit (PIU) will be established in MFB (the Implementing Agency) in\nIslamabad. The PMU will ensure submission of periodic reports; arrange for audits of MSDF,\nCIF, RMF, and DPF; and review MFB\u2019s disbursement requests. Sound accounting and internal\ncontrol systems will be adopted by the PMU in the discharge of its expected role. Drawing on\nthe management information system of MFB, the PIU will submit information and analysis to the\nPMU and coordinate the fielding and work of consultants.\nb. Implementation Schedule\n116. The Project will be implemented over six years, from 2001-2006 (Appendix 15). Prior to\nloan effectiveness, MFB will start recruiting and training staff, begin designing products and\nservices,  install  basic  financial  reporting  system  and  operating  procedures,  and  reach  a\npartnership agreement with NRSP.\n3. Procurement\n117. Procurement of goods and services will be subject to the provisions of ADB's Guidelines\nfor Procurement.  Vehicles  and  office  equipment  will  be  procured  through  international\ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  for  packages  exceeding  $500,000  equivalent,  and  through\ninternational shopping procedures for packages between $100,000 and $500,000 equivalent.\nFor packages below $100,000 equivalent direct purchase may be used.\n118. Using MSDF and CIF interest revenue, MFB will contract out the major part of CO\nformation, all CO training, and implementation of community infrastructure projects to NGOs\nthat demonstrate competitive capability for this. The selection criteria for NGOs will be agreed to\nby ADB and the work will be awarded through a transparent process. Planning for CO formation\nwill be based on joint discussions between MFB and NGOs at the field and head office levels,\nand  be  subject  to  quarterly  reviews.  The  NGO  service  providers  will  be  hired  based  on\npartnership agreements that include gender outreach targets.\n4. Consulting Services\n119. A  total  of  66  person-months  of  international  and  37  person-months  of  domestic\nconsulting (Appendix 16) services will be required. All consultants to be financed from the\nproceeds of the ADB loan will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants. Consultants will be recruited by SBP for policy-related issues, and by MFB for all\nother purposes.\n5. Flow of Funds\n120. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Borrower. SBP, as the representative of\nthe Borrower, will pass on the proceeds in the following manner (Appendix 17):\n(i)  A credit line of $68 million equivalent will be provided by SBP to MFB in Pakistan\nrupee  based  on  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  satisfactory  to  ADB.  Loan\nrepayments will have a term of 20 years including a grace period for principal of 8", "30\nyears followed by 12 years principal repayment in equal installments at six-\nmonthly intervals.\n(ii)  MFB can seek quarterly reimbursement from the ADB credit line on the basis of\namounts disbursed to its borrowers. Within the overall limit, the credit line will\nfund 80 percent of the disbursements in the initial years to facilitate outreach\nexpansion. The reimbursement request will be processed by SBP and submitted\nto ADB along with the latest operational data, audited financial statement, and\ninspection report of SBP. On receipt of a request from SBP, the amount will be\ncredited to the designated account of MFB by ADB.\n(iii)  Onlending  support  will  be  contingent  upon  MFB  meeting  key  performance\nindicators (Appendix 7, Table A7.3). In the event that MFB fails to meet most of\nthe  performance  indicators,  provisional  eligibility  could  be  granted  upon\nsubmission of an institutional development plan, with a specific time frame for\nimproving  performance,  acceptable  to  ADB.  SBP  will  monitor  the  progress\nsemiannually.\n(iv)  The relending rate to MFB will be the average weighted cost of deposits in the\nbanking  industry,  currently  7  percent,  calculated  periodically  by  SBP.  The\naverage cost of the immediately preceding half-year will apply. The Government\nwill credit the difference between the ADB loan rate and the relending rate to\nRMF and DPF.\n(v)  MFB  will  onlend  to  subborrowers  at  an  interest  rate  to  recover  its  financial\nintermediation costs and to ensure that sufficient surplus is left with the poor\nhouseholds. The lending rate to subborrowers in the initial years is estimated at\n18 percent per annum.36 MFB will need to keep its costs down, as the poor will\nhave  to  bear  these.  The  large  equity  base  and  support  for  institutional\ndevelopment, including for infrastructure, will cushion start-up costs, especially\nthose associated with expansion in remote areas. The MSDF interest revenue\nwill  fund  social  intermediation  costs.  Continuous  monitoring,  performance\nbenchmarks,  and  audits  will  ensure  that  MFB  remains  a  lean  and  efficient\ninstitution, does not take advantage of operating as the sole provider of MF in\nsome districts, and becomes financially viable in 4-5 years.\n(vi)  Funds for equipment, infrastructure, training, and consulting service for MFB,\nMFIs, and SBP, will be a grant from the Borrower using the loan proceeds.\n(vii)  MFB will periodically submit claims to the Funds Secretariat for reimbursement\nfrom MSDF and CIF with necessary documentation evidencing engagement and\ncompletion of services invoiced by NGO service providers. The Fund Committee\nwill process the claims and reimburse MFB within seven days. Reasons for\ndelay, if any will have to be communicated to MFB.\n(viii)  MFB will periodically submit claims for assistance from RMF to the Microfinance\nSupport Division at SBP with necessary documentation. Support from DPF to\nguarantee the depositors of MFB will be available only in the event of MFB\n                  \n36  Subject to vary with scale of operation, efficiency, conditions in the money market, etc.", "31\nliquidation. In this event, the Microfinance Support Division will determine the\nextent of coverage based on the DPF balance.\n6. Management of MSDF, CIF, RMF, and DPF\n121. Good governance practices have been incorporated into the rules governing the funds\ncreated as part of the MSDP. Each fund is governed by specific rules, formulated in consultation\nwith ADB, to ensure that specified objectives are achieved. The investment of the principal\namount will be undertaken by SBP only in approved government securities; this is to ward off\nany speculative investments. The MSDF and CIF interest revenue will be credited by SBP into\ndesignated income accounts to be expensed out to meet the objectives of the respective funds.\nThe Fund Committee will manage the income accounts, and the administrative aspects will be\nhandled by the Fund Secretariat. The Fund Committee consists of the MFB president, one MFB\ndirector and one SBP nominee. Authorized signatories will operate the income accounts. All\npayments will be based on invoices and credited to the account of the NGO service providers\nafter  documentary  evidence  of  having  satisfactorily  completed  the  assignment.  The\nMicrofinance Support Division of SBP will manage RMF and DPF, and be responsible for their\ninvestment, management, and operation. All the funds and their usage will be annually audited\nby independent auditors and the reports will be made public.\n122. NGO service providers will need to meet criteria specified by the Fund Committee and\nenter into partnership agreements with MFB. The agreements will also indicate key performance\nindicators  including  formulation  of  COs  that  meet  gender  outreach  targets.  Community\nparticipation will enhance good governance. CIF support has been linked to 80 percent of the\nCO members agreeing to support the community infrastructure subproject and contribute part of\nthe cost. For assistance from RMF, three fourths of the CO members will have to certify the\nneed for assistance to an individual member and this will be validated by the MFB field officer.\n7. Imprest Account\n123. One imprest account will be established by SBP in the National Bank of Pakistan after\nloan effectiveness and in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook to facilitate\ndisbursement for small items of equipment and training related to institutional strengthening\n(project management, establishment of the MF framework, and ADBP audit). Operations of the\nimprest  account  must  be  supported  by  appropriate  withdrawal  applications  and  related\ndocumentation.  Individual  payments  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  statement  of\nexpenditure procedure will not exceed $50,000 equivalent.\n8. Anticorruption\n124. The capacity of SBP and MFB to prevent potentially corrupt practices will be enhanced\nthrough effective project management and monitoring to ensure that bidders, suppliers, and\ncontractors observe the highest standards of ethics in procurement and execution.\n9. Project Reviews\n125. ADB and the Government will periodically review project implementation. The reviews\nwill include evaluation of the project scope, implementation arrangements, consultation with\nNGOs and MFB clients, achievement of MFB business plans, progress with the policy reform\nagenda, and capacity building measures. ADB will also field regular review missions, including\nmidterm and project completion review missions.", "32\n10. Reports\n126. The PMU will submit reports to ADB concerning the use of loan proceeds, project\nadministration, and financial management. The reports will include (i) quarterly, semiannual, and\nannual project implementation reports; (ii) a midterm review report; and (iii) a project completion\nreport to be submitted not later than six months after project completion. The reports will cover\n(i) expenditures, (ii) activities financed by MSDF and CIF, (iii) assistance provided by RMF, (iv)\nhighlights of audit reports, (v) MFB operations and financial performance, and (vi) training\nactivities and their impact. These aspects will be discussed in greater detail in the annual reports.\n11. Accounts and Audit\n127. The Government will maintain separate records and accounts for the imprest funds and\nproject expenditure in accordance with sound accounting principles and will have such accounts\nand records audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB. The Government will ensure that\nthe submission of project reports, audited accounts, and financial statements are in compliance\nwith ADB's revised guidelines introduced in 1998. Audited annual accounts of MFB will be\nsubmitted to ADB within six months of the reporting period. SBP will also provide a copy of its\ninspection report of MFB. MSDF, CIF, RMF, and DPF will be audited annually by independent\nauditors acceptable to ADB. The auditor will also carry out inspection of physical activities. In\nparticular, the following consequence for noncompliance was highlighted: (i) suspension of\ndisbursements, new contract awards, and replenishment of the imprest account if compliance is\ndelayed by more than 9 months; and (ii) suspension of the loan if compliance is delayed by\nmore than 12 months.\n \n12. Project Performance Monitoring System\n128. For internal control and use by ADB and the Government, an information system will be\nestablished by MFB to provide monthly, quarterly, and annual computer-generated reports. The\ninformation  system  will  comprise  (i)  financial  reports  covering  loan  portfolio  growth  and\nperformance, liability growth and management especially of savings deposits, and financial\nperformance indicators concerning earnings and liability structures; (ii) details concerning the\nnumber of poor by gender, type of services, and the size of transactions; (iii) information on the\nperformance of staff measured by financial volume, number of customers, and earnings ratios;\n(iv)  information  showing  planned  levels  of  activities  against  actual;  (v)  annual  financial\nstatements; and (vi) poverty reduction impact of services. MFB business plan will provide the\nfinancial performance benchmarks. The MFB will set up a website containing all its financial and\noperational information.\n129.  Services of social science specialists will be contracted to carry out sample surveys and\nparticipatory research, analyze data, and provide a written report for use by the Government\nand ADB on the social and gender dimensions of the Project. These will be carried out 12\nmonths after the start of providing social and financial services, with another review two years\nafter this date, and a final review when MFB is carrying out its project completion review. With\nregards to social capital the review will include an evaluation of the cohesion within COs,\nincrease in capability of COs, levels of participation of individuals within COs, networking of\nCOs, impact on family life and gender relations, quality of services provided by NGOs in social\ncapital formation, and the overall impact of the use of MSDF, CIF, and RMF. Concerning MFB\nas  an  institution,  the  reviews  will  evaluate  management  autonomy,  institutional  role  and\nstrategy,  organizational  structure,  credit  policy  and  procedures,  appropriateness  of  service\ndelivery systems, performance measurement, management information system, and training", "33\npolicies and programs as these relate to furthering the social agenda included in the MFB\nstatute.\nVI. BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA. Expected Impacts\n1. Programs and Policies\n130. The MSDP will signal the resolution of the Government to develop the MF sector. A\nfundamental shift will occur on how MF is perceived, designed, and delivered; this will extend\nthe frontiers of MF, particularly\n(i) the development of a policy framework will help establish an MF system that will\ncatalyze  investments  to  augment  the  retail  capacity  for  significant  poverty\nreduction impact;\n(ii) the  development  of  the  regulatory  and  supervisory  framework  and  capacity\nenhancement  of  SBP  will  ensure  financial  soundness,  good  governance,\ntransparency, and appropriate systems and procedures in the MF sector;\n(iii) the opening of the MF sector in consultation with stakeholders will lead to an\norderly  and  systemic  development  of  the  sector,  and  NGOs  will  have  the\nopportunity to graduate into regulated financial institutions and be able to provide\na range of services;\n(iv) integration with the financial system will bridge the demand and supply gap as\nthe retail capacity grows, and local financial intermediation will be enhanced; and\n(v) the  process  of  reforming  ADBP  and  cooperatives  will  be  initiated;  this  will\ncomplement banking reforms.\n2. Economic Analysis\n131. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the sample income generating activities\nranged from a sector high of 33/34 percent (agricultural crops and manufacturing/processing) to\na sector low of 23 percent (services and trade). The weighted average EIRR was 27 percent.\nThe EIRR of community infrastructure subprojects ranged from a high of 36 percent for pond\nirrigation to a low of 21 percent for dugwells (Appendix 18).\n3. Financial Analysis\n132. The range in enterprise internal rate of return is 23\u201360 percent, with a weighted average\nof 34 percent (Appendix 18) reducing to 25 percent after allowing for enterprise failure. The\nprofiles show moderately attractive investments available to the rural poor. On average, the new\ninvestments result in 70 days of labor creating the equivalent of 400,000 full-time jobs. In\naddition, 1,506 jobs are created in MFB and 270 jobs in NGOs providing social services to the\nnew COs.\n133. Microfinance Bank. Projections over 10 years show MFB can become a viable financial\ninstitution in terms of being able to service liabilities and retain earnings sufficiently to maintain", "34\nthe equity base (Appendix 7, Table A7.1 and Table A7.2). By year 6, MFB will have 560,000\nborrowers and savers, and about 80,000 nonborrower savers. In year 6, the net worth will be\nPRs1,869 million ($33 million), deposits PRs1,740 million ($31 million),37 and net outstanding\nloans PRs7,430 million ($133 million). MFB is expected to break even at year 4. The capital to\nassets ratio of MFB is never less than 16 percent and the return on equity is 10 percent at year\n6 (Appendix 18, Table A18.1). Projections also indicate the viability of small- and medium-sized\nMFIs. Small MFIs could break-even within 5 years of start-up and reach about 25,000-30,000\nborrowers in 10 years.\n4. Environmental Impact\n134. An initial environmental examination was made of 50 typical microenterprise activities\nwith the results grouped into seven categories to determine their impact on the environment\n(Appendix 19). The microenterprises examined have a small or no significant effect on the\nenvironment. Holding livestock close to dwellings constitutes a slight but acceptable irritant.\nAnimal feeds will largely be cut and carried, and supplemented by concentrates. Agricultural\ncrop financing will encourage higher value crops such as vegetables with less deleterious\nimpact on soils than depletive cereal cropping. Training of MFB field officers and their regular\ndiscussions on environmental issues with CO members will mitigate any negative impacts.\n5. Impact on Poverty\n135. The  development  and  strengthening  of  pro-poor  institutions  through  private-public\npartnership, will ensure that poverty reduction impact (Appendix 20) is felt beyond the life of the\nMSDP. At full implementation, MFB will provide access to 560,000 clients, about 9 percent of all\npoor households, of whom 225,000 will be poor women; and have sound prospects to expand\nits services. MFIs expected to be established during project implementation could add another\n20,000 clients.\n136. By instituting MSDF for social intermediation, the MSDP will enhance social capital with\nsignificant externalities to the local economy. Appropriately designed and priced MF services\nthat take into consideration the asset and consumption buildup of households are expected to\nenhance household income above the poverty threshold after 4-5 microcredit cycles. CIF will\nprovide access to infrastructure for improving livelihoods through efficient and productive use of\nlocal resources with the involvement of local stakeholders. Risks of the poor households will be\nmitigated through RMF and DPF.\n137. Delivery of MF services in partnership with NGOs based on their core competency in\nsocial  services  will  spawn  a  countrywide  efficient  and  flexible  arrangement  for  enhancing\noutreach at low cost. This will reduce transaction costs to the poor. Training, research, and\ndissemination will enhance the capacity of MFIs and NGOs, and thus benefit the poor. The\nbuilding  of  a  broad  coalition  of  NGOs  and  other  aid  initiatives  will  promote  stakeholder\ncoordination  and  lead  to  a  broadened  range  of  institutional  arrangements  that  will  act  as\nintermediaries for implementing MF components of ADB-funded projects.\n                  \n37 The potential for savings is higher than assumed. In many areas, MFB will be the only depository institution able\nto provide convenient and ready access to the poor. The mobilization of deposits, furthermore, is consistent with\nthe need for greater financial depth in the economy. Deposit mobilization of MFB is projected to reach PRs2,250\n($40) per borrower and PRs6,000 ($107) per nonborrower at year 6.", "35\nB. Risks and Safeguards\n138. The MSDP design is based on lessons learned from successful practices, and has\nstrong ownership by the Government and stakeholders. The following are identified risks.\n1. Policy Loan\n139. Delay  in  policy  reforms.  Effective  policy  dialogue,  stakeholder  coordination,  and\ncapacity  building  support  are  safeguards.  The  Government  has  demonstrated  strong\ncommitment to the reforms, and has already taken several measures as agreed with ADB. The\nGovernment\u2019s commitment to ensure efficient resource allocation through the banking system\nand its experience with banking reforms will ensure that DFI restructuring starts in earnest.\n140. Lack of autonomy. Despite measures to ensure autonomy, private-public partnership,\nand professional management, MFB may come under political pressure to disburse credit faster\nthan  its  capacity  allows.  MFB  ordinance  clearly  establishes  (i)  autonomy  of  the  board  of\ndirectors, (ii) no government official or member of political party is eligible to become a director,\nand (iii) SBP will be the supervisory and regulatory authority. Operations in partnership with\nNGOs will ensure that social mobilization dictates the pace of service delivery. Furthermore,\nrules issued under the MFB statute will strengthen good corporate governance.\n2. Investment Loan\n141. No growth in income of poor. Income of the poor may not increase due to slow\nmacroeconomic growth and constrained market opportunities. Improved economic performance\nand pro-poor growth are expected as a result of IPRSP implementation. The Government has\nalso speeded up the macroeconomic reforms. In addition, as part of the social intermediation\nprocess, clients will be advised on prudent economic choices.\n142. Marginalization of poor and women. Access of women to MF may remain below the\ntargeted 40 percent due to the slow pace of formation of COs, capacity building, and expansion\nof MFB branch network. Procedures to mainstream women\u2019s participation are an essential part\nof the MSDP design. The MSDP aims to address both economic and social integration as\nfollows: (i) MSDF and CIF will ensure adequate investments are made in social intermediation\nto enhance the absorptive capacity of the poor; (ii) 40 percent of the field staff of MFB will be\nwomen; (iii) mobility constraints will be addressed through vehicles; (iv) resource support for\nexpansion of MFB will ensure that it establishes its presence in remote areas as early as\npossible; and (v) collection and analysis of gender desegregated data will enable continuous\nmonitoring and evaluation of the impact of the MSDP on women and ensure adjustments as\nrequired. In addition, effective targeting of poor communities, participatory processes, screening\nof subprojects, small loan size, and pricing at above the CB-based lending rates will make MFB\nloans less attractive to nonpoor.\n143. High delinquency. MFB is most vulnerable to increases in loan losses and reductions in\nloan  revenues.  The  following  constitute  an  effective  safeguard  against  delinquency:  (i)\nsignificant investment in capacity building of MFB, (ii) adoption of successful practices, (iii)\nadequate loan loss provisions, (iv) risk mitigation measures to help borrowers stabilize their\nincome flows, (v) adequate training and capacity building of clients, and (vi) peer pressure to\nensure repayments. In addition MFB will have a sufficient capital base to bear financial risks,\nassured support for social intermediation to help the poor to effectively use financial services,\nexpertise of the private sector, and partnership arrangements with NGOs.", "36\n144. Implementation delays. Capacity constraints of MFB might delay implementation. This\nwill be addressed by providing project implementation support to MFB and closely monitoring its\nperformance. Advance action for procuring consulting services has been approved. Delays due\nto  adjustment  to  the  system-wide  changes  expected  consequent  to  the  findings  of  the\nCommission  on  Transformation  of  the  Financial  System  (para.  40)  are  mitigated  through\ntechnical support to facilitate changes in operating procedures.\nVII. ASSURANCES\n145. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  The Government will ensure that the policies adopted and actions taken as\ndescribed in the development policy letter continue in effect during and after the\nMSDP.\n(ii)  Subject to prescribed regulations that will include appropriate provisions of audit,\ntransparency, and disclosure of information, MFB will have complete autonomy\nfor disposal of assets, pricing of financial service products, appointment and\ntermination of staff, and payment of salary and performance incentives to staff.\n(iii)  If required, the MFB ordinance will be amended, in consultation with ADB, to\nreflect specific features of the framework for institutional diversity in the MF\nsector to be developed as part of the MSDP (para. 74) or in the event MFB\nbecomes wholly owned by the private sector. The MFB ordinance will not be\namended, or abrogated, if in the opinion of ADB, this will materially and adversely\naffect MFB\u2019s performance.\n(iv)  The equity of the two state-owned CBs in MFB will not be acquired by any other\ngovernment institution after their privatization.\n(v)  MFB will promptly inform ADB of any change in its board of directors or its senior\nmanagement  team,  and  ensure  that  any  such  change  will  be  made  in\naccordance with the provisions set forth under specified regulations.\n(vi)  In case of natural calamities and unforeseen circumstances that affect the equity\nand liquidity of MFB, ADB will be consulted immediately and a remedial action\nplan prepared within three months thereafter.\n(vii)  Pursuant to amendment to the SBP Act 1956 the rules as agreed with ADB for\nthe management and operations for MSDF, CIF, RMF, and DPF will be adopted.\n(viii)  The Government will strengthen the activities of SBP, and assist the private\nsector in identifying and promoting small MFIs, and will ensure resources are\nprovided to SBP and MFB in a timely manner.", "37\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\n146. I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of\nADB, and recommend that the Board approve:\n(i) the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights of 54,114,000\nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Microfinance Sector Development\nProgram, with a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an\ninterest charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and\n1.5 percent per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are\nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement\npresented to the Board; and\n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights of 61,845,000\nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Microfinance Sector Development\nProject, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an\ninterest charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and\n1.5 percent per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are\nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement\npresented to the Board.\n          TADAO CHINO\n         President\n17 November 2000", "38\nAPPENDIXES\nNumber Title           Page      Cited on\n                          (page, para.)\n 1 Development Policy Letter and Policy Matrix              39   1, 3\n   2 Program Framework              47  1, 3\n   3 Sector Indicators                          52              1, 3\n   4 Social Dimension of Poverty              54 3, 10\n   5 National Rural Support Program              56                   6, 22\n   6  External Assistance to the Sector                           57           12, 47\n   7 Microfinance Bank              58                 18, 71\n   8 Microfinance Social Development Fund              65           19, 76\n   9 Community Investment Fund                   69                 19, 77\n 10 Risk Mitigation Fund              72                 20, 79\n 11 Deposit Protection Fund              74           20,  80\n 12 Cost Estimates              76           24,  97\n 13 Project Organization Chart              78                26,  105\n 14 Ineligible Items              79                27,  106\n 15 Implementation Schedule                          80                29,  116\n 16 Outline Terms of Reference for Consulting Services             81           29, 119\n 17 Flow of Funds               84                29,  120\n 18 Financial and Economic Analysis              85                33,  131\n 19 Summary Initial Environmental Examination              88           34, 134\n 20 Poverty Impact Assessment              89                 34, 135\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available on request)\n  A Financial and Economic Analysis \u2013 Tables\n  B Detail Cost Tables\n  C Detail Terms of Reference for Consulting Services\n  D Assessment of Microfinance Sector in Pakistan\n  E Profile of Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund\n  F Financial Analysis of Microfinance Bank \n  G Financial Analysis of Microfinance Institution", "-.-.\"~ .... :.~..1\\~  ,  ,.\n39\nAppendix  1, page  1\nDEVELOPMENT  POLICY  LETTER\nISLAMABAD\nNov.  4,  2000\nD.O.  No. 11777-AFS(F)/2000\nPAKISTAN\nPakistan:  Microfinance  Sector Development  Program\nDear  Mr.  President,\n1.  The  structural  reforms  undertaken  by the  Government  in recent  years  have  resulted  in  some\nencouraging  signs.  Real gross  domestic  product  grew  by 4.5 percent  during  2000  as against  3.2 percent\nof  the  previous  year.  To  maintain  this  trend  the  Government  will  pursue  the  reform  agenda  through\nimprovements  in fiscal  and balance  of payments  positions,  restoring  investor  confidence,  achieving  higher\ngrowth  on a sustainable  basis,  and  improving  social  indicators.  Government  has also  taken  a conscious\ndecision  to bring  poverty  alleviation  into the center  stage  of economic  policy  making  since  the declining\neconomic  growth  of past several  years  has led to an alarming  increase  in poverty  incidence.  The  number\nof poor is estimated  to have risen from  17.6 millionJn  1987/88  to 44.9 million  in 1998/99.\n2.  The  strategy  to reduce  poverty  and  income  inequality  of the Government  emphasizes  sustained\npro-poor  growth  based  on  private  sector  activity  and  investment.  The  anti-poverty  program,  among\nothers,  include:  (i) direct  employment  generation  through  small  infrastructure  projects;  (ii) introduction  of\nsocial  safety  nets  such  as food  support  program;  (iii) enhanced  access  to basic  education,  health,  and\nnutrition;  and  (iv)  access  to  sustainable  microfinance  services  for  the  poor  to  enhance  their  income\nearning  capacity.  T!lese  are aimed  to enhance  skills,  access  to productive  resources,  and social  services;\nthe key obstacles  in combating  poverty.\n3.  Microfinance  is  not  widespread  in  Pakistan.  The  aggregate  outreach  from  banks  and  other\ninstitutional  sources  is less  than  5 percent  of the  potential  market  of nearly  6.3  million  households.  The\nmicrofinance  sector  in Pakistan  is characterized  by a narrow  institutional  base,  limited  retail  capacity  and\nlittle,  if any,  financial  integration.  Commercial  banks,  in general,  are  neither  structured  nor  geared  to\nextend  their  microfinance  exposure  beyond  experimental  forays  and  development  finance  institutions\n(DFls)  do not target  asset  less poor.  Non-government  organizations  (NGOs)  have shown  appreciation  of\nthe  nature  of  microfinance  demand  emanating  from  the  poor  through  effective  targeting,  participatory\napproache$,  capacity  building  and  gender  sensitivity.  Yet,  their  microfinance  operations  are  unlikely  to\nattain  financial  self-sufficiency.  The informal  sources  are the only window  available  for the poor.  However,\ninformal  sources  provide  services  at terms  that tend to perpetuate  rather than amefiorate  poverty.\n4.  It  is, therefore,  a  matter  of  urgent  priority  for  the  country  that  a  pro-poor  financial  system  is\nestablished  as a 'critical  element  for combating  the rising incidence  of poverty.  This  is being  undertaken  in\na manner  that  is consistent  with  the  overall  reforms  in the  banking  sector  in terms  of autonomy,  good\ngovernance,  privatization  and  sustainability.  It  is  here  that  I would  like  to  elaborate  the  substantial\nprogress  made  during  the last couple  of years,  especially  in year 2000,  in implementing  banking  sector\nreforms  by  conducting  monetary  policy  with  market-based  instruments,  liberalizing  interest  rates  and\nrestoring  financial  discipline  through  prudent  lending.  Enhancing  SBP's  authority  in banking  regulation\nand supervision,  and  improving  the capital  base  and management  of the nationalized  commercial  banks\nto stem  the hemorrhage  caused  by politically-motivated  lending  have  introduced  a measure  of prudenge\nin the whole  system.  Greater  transparency  and financial  disclosures  have helped  to restore  confidence  in\nthe banks.  Operating  losses  of banks  have  been cut by reducing  over staffing  and excessive  numbers  of\nbranches  through  staff separation  and branch  closure  policy.\n5.  Keeping  the direction  of reforms  in perspective,  the Government  has formulated  a comprehensive\nMicrofinance  Sector  Development  Program  (MSDP)  with  the  assistance  of  Asian  Development  Bank\n(ADB)  to broaden  and  deepen  the  microfinance  sector.  This  will  be attained  by (i) creating  a conducive\npolicy  environment,  (ii) developing  appropriate  financial  infrastructure,  (iii)  promoting  and  strengthening", ".c  -..,.-'  \"..-,.   .~~,  40  c,,\". .A ppendix  1, page 2\n.,\nmicrofinance  institutions  (MFls),  (iv)  developing  linkages  with  NGOs  and  community  or9anizations,  (v)\ninvesting  in  building  social  capital,  (vi)  mitigating  risks  of  poor  households,  and  (vii)  institutional\ndevelopment.  The  following  measures  will  specifically  be  done  under  the  MSDP.  the  policy  aspects  of\nwhich  are  detailed  in the  attached  policy  matrix.\n6.  First,  the  Government  has  adopted  a  microfinance  policy  that  mainstreams  the  concept  of\nsustainable  microfinance,  recognizes  the need to enhance  social capital,  and considers  risk mitigation  as\na necessary  safety  net measure  for the  poor.  The  policy  also  recognizes  the need  for and  encourages\npartnership  between  public-private  -sectors, especiallyNGOs,  in poverty  reduction.  The policy encourages\nprivate  sector  entry  into  banking  with  the  poor  to  ensure  innovation  and  flexibility.  Considering\nmicrofinance  as an integral  part of the financial  sector,  the State  Bank of Pakistan  (SBP) has taken  a pro-\nactive  role  in the development  of the  microfinance  sector  through  the creation  of the  required  financial\ninfrastructure.  This  outline  has  been  arrived  at after discussions  with  existing  providers  of microfinance,\nbased  on international  experience  and discussions  with ADB.\n7.  Second,  a  Microfinance  Bank  (MFB)  has  been  established  to  institutionalize  the  microfinance\npolicy.  MFB is owned  by 3 public  sector,  11 private  sector  and 2 international  banks to enhance  outreach\nin a grossly  underserved  market.  The  organization  and  operations  of  MFB  have  been  designed  for  a\nsustainable  community-based  service  delivery  system.  Other  attributes  built-in the framework  of MFB are\nstructural  integration  and partnership  with the National  Rural  Support  Program  (NRSP),  the largest  NGO\nin Pakistan  with extensive  experience  in social  mobilization  as well as microfinance.  The MFB will deliver\nservices  through  NGOs  using  their  core  competency  in social  mobilization.  Three  out of eight  Board  of\nDirectors  of MFB come  from  NGOs,  including  two women,  and the rest from the private  sector.  About  40\npercent  of the staff of MFB as well as clients will be women.  The SBP has designed  a separate  regulatory\nframework  for  MFB  and  approved  a stringent  set of  measures  to ensure  good  corporate  governance.\nMFB, once  it develops  its portfolio  and credibility , will be able to lead the way for financial  integration  and\novercome  the  reluctance  of  the  money  markets  in  investing  in  microfinance.  Though  MFB  is  an\nindigenous  institution  responding  to the conditions  prevalent  in Pakistan,  experiences  of other  countries\nwhere  the microfinance  sector  has developed  around  a lead institution  have been taken  into account,  and\nMFB  subsumes  the successful  microfinance  practices  elsewhere.  The  MFB  could  possibly  be listed  on\nthe capital  markets  in due course.\n8.  .Third, the design  and the financial  infrastructure  created  to support  MFS will be used as a basis\nto develop  a framework  -legal,  supervisory  and  regulatory  -to  mainstream  the  attributes  of the  basic\nmicrofinance  policy,  through  (i) definition  and categorization  of MFls  and  their  licensing  procedures,  (ii)\ncorresponding  supervision  and  regulation  standards  and  systems,  (iii)  disclosure  and  reporting\nrequirements.  and (iv) appropriate  adjustment  for entry threshold  prescribed  under the banking  laws. This\nsequencing  is necessary  prior  to opening  the  sector  for  enhancing  the supervisory  capacity  of SSP  to\nprotect  the  interests  of the  poor.  A  Consultative  Group  will  ensure  wide  stakeholder  consultation.  The\nframework  will  provide  the  scope  for  NGOs  to  become  regulated  financial  institutions  to  broaden  and\ndeepen  the  microfinance  sector.  We  see this as a fundamental  strategic  initiative  to meet  the wide  gap\nbetween  demand  and supply  of microfinance.  Once  established,  the framework  will be, if required,  made\napplicable  to the  MFS. A Microfinance  Support  Division  has been  established  in SSP to ensure  orderly\ndevelopment  of the sector.\n9.  .Fourth,  as an integral  part of the microfinance  policy  support  for intensive  and sustained  social\npreparation,  particularly  to  enhance  outreach  to  poor  women,  building  capacity  of  communities  and\nproviding  access  to basic infrastructure  has been recognized.  While  this has been widely felt, investments\nin  social  and  gender  aspects  have  been  inadequate  and  their  linkages  with  affordable  microfinance\nse(Vices  weak.  Attempts  to  provide  these  services  at  cost  to  the  poor  have  neither  helped  the\nsustainability  of  MFls  nor  have  the  intended  beneficiaries  been  able  to  absorb  the  cost.  There  is,\ntherefore,  need,  at  least  in  the  short  to  medium  term,  to  segregate  social  costs  from  financial\nintermediation  costs  so that  these  can  be separately  budgeted  and  provided  for. A Microfinance  Social\nDevelopment  Fund  and  a  Community  Investment  Fund  has  been  created  to  ensure  sustained  and\nassured  investment  in building  social  capital.  Support  will  be provided  for community  organization,  skills\ndevelopment,  and access  to community  infrastructure  exclusively  to the poor, and especially  to women,\norganized  in communities  to enable  them  to fully utilize microfinance  services.  Dedicated  initially  to MFB,\nsupport  from  these  funds  will  be  made  available  to  regulated  MFls  as  they  emerge  under  the  new", "41\nAppendix  1 , page  3\nframework.  As NGOs  will  provide  social  intermediation  services  on behalf  of MFB and will  be paid  for  it,\nthese  funds  further  Government's  objective  to strengthen  the NGO  sector  for other  positive  externalities,\nparticularly  those  related  to gender.  Pursuing  this  approach  from  the outset  will  ensure  group  cohesion,\nquality  of loan portfolio,  and sustainability.\n10.  Fifth,  as a pro-poor  innovation  a Risk  Mitigation  Fund  has  been  established,  to  reduce  the  risk\naversion  of the poor for fear  of indebtedness  in failed  enterprises  and enable  the poor households  to take\nadvant~ge  of potentially  viable  new technologies,  production  choices,  and income  opportunities.  The  Risk\nMitigation  Fund  will  assist  the  poor  in  case  of  loss  of  income  generating  assets  due  to  unforeseen\ncircumstances  beyond  their  control.  As  a  safety  net  measure  a  Deposit  Protection  Fund  has  been\nestablished  to provide  security  to the savings  of the poor.\n11.  Initial  contributions  to these  funds  have  been  made  by MFB.  Rules  to operate  these  funds  have\nbeen  framed  to ensure  transparency  and  good  governance.  Government  will  also  contribute  to  these\nfunds.  As a matter  of additional  precaution  the  State  Bank  of Pakistan  Act,  1956  has  been  amended  to\nenable  SBP  to  hold  and  invest  these  funds  directly  to  provide  further  insulation  from  any  extraneous\ninterference.\n12.  Sixth,  as part of the MSDP,  the Government  will initiate  restructuring  of DFls,  many of whom  have\na  poor  governance  structure,  high  levels  of  non-performing  loans,  incapacity  to  raise  resources,  and\nrelatively  high  cost  of  service  delivery.  Their  performance  adversely  affects  the  environment  for\nsustainable  financial  intermediation  and  potential  investments  in  the  microfinance  sector.  Under  the\nMSDP,  the Government  will close the Federal  Bank of Cooperative  as its financial  intermediation  role has\nbeen  of limited  utility.  This will  involve  payment  of severance  pay to about  250 staff.  The  restructuring  of\nthe Agricultural  Development  Bank of Pakistan  (ADBP)  will be initiated  with a portfolio  audit  to assess  the\nrestructuring  cost,  which  is  expected  to  be  substantial.  The  Government  will  discuss  with  ADB  the\npossibility  for  support  for  the  restructuring  plan.  In  addition,  resource  support  from  SBP  to  ADBP\n(including  that for the provincial  cooperative  banks)  has been  indexed  to average  rate of treasury  bills  in\norder to align the cost of resources  with the microfinance  sector.\n13.  Mr.  President,  poverty  reduction  as  an  overarching  objective  and  microfinance  as  one  of  its\ncritical  elements  is shared  both  by  the  Government  and  ADS.  The  Government  is confident  that  the\nmeasures  initiated  under  MSDP  will  significantly  contribute  towards  poverty  reduction.  I look  forward  to\nsupport  from  ADS  to implement  MSDP  and for  policy  dialogue  to assess  support  for future  initiatives.  I\nappreciate  and  value  ADS's  role  in designing  a synergetic  and  innovative  private-public  partnership  to\nreduce  poverty  and the efforts  made  to develop  a consensus  around  this.  Rising  poverty  incidence  is a\nserious  cause  for concern.\nYours  sillccrcly\n, \\  r'I  ~~\n~~~-\n(Shaukat  I\\ziz)\nMr. Tadao  Chino\nPresident,\nAsian  Development  Bank\nMetro  Manila,\nPhiliooines", "Policy Matrix\nObjectives Rationale First Tranche/Actions Complied Within 24 Months of Other Program\nMay to October 2000 period Release of First Tranche Actions\n(2001\u20132006)\nThe purpose of the Microfinance Sector Development Program (MSDP) is to develop the microfinance (MF) sector to efficiently provide a range of financial and social\nservices to the poor, especially women who disproportionately bear the burden of poverty.

Pakistan has 134 million citizens; 33 percent live in urban areas and 67 percent in rural\nareas.  About 44 million or 33 percent of the population live in poverty. Three fourths of the poor\nlive in rural area. The average family size is seven people. The level of poverty is nearly 45\npercent1 when it is recognized as a multidimensional phenomenon including affordability of\neducation, health care, clean water; plus opportunities for good jobs, security, political, and\nsocial freedom. Households headed by women, those with many dependents, those in rural\nareas with no livestock, and single earner households in urban areas are among the poorest.\nPakistan ranks 138th among 174 countries in the terms of the human development index of\nUnited Nations Development Programme.\n2. Urbanization was very rapid after the creation of Pakistan in 1947. Seasonal migration is\ncommon and migrants retain strong ties to their family homes in the countryside. Industrial\ngrowth, led by a small group of large-scale private manufacturers with close ties to banks and\ngovernment who promoted mechanization, attracted many laborers to the growing cities. Capital\nhas accumulated in a few large urban centers. Urban society remains stratified with a small elite\nand masses, similar to that traditionally found in the countryside.\n3. In rural areas, people live in villages of 50 to 3,000 households. They are landlords,\ntenant farmers, artisans, or landless laborers.  Landlords, classified by the size of their holdings,\nare the social and economic elite. Sharecroppers contribute only labor and keep 25 to 33\npercent of the crops. Sharecropper-tenants share the cost of production, contribute labor, and\nreceive 50 percent of the output. Both are generally poor. Those who lease land (25 percent of\ntenants) may be better-off, provided that rent is not excessive. Artisans provide traditional\nservices to communities and are frequently poor. Landless laborers are the poorest, and by\nvirtue of being in debt to landowners may be obliged to labor on their lands\u2014as bonded\nlaborers\u2014to try to pay their ever-increasing debts.\n4. The family system is the basis of rural life. It defines individual identity, social status,\npolitical role, and economic level often including occupational category. It is defined by men, so\nfamily membership is inherited through men, and women move from their natal family to their\n\u201creal\u201d family upon marriage, often in their early teens. Women live as much as possible in\npurdah, and have limited social and economic interaction. Early in life, they internalize attitudes\nthat  contribute  to  perpetuation  of  this  system  and  generally  accept  this  as  culturally  and\nreligiously appropriate. For many, the notion that they might exercise public choice is remote,\neven though they may attain considerable influence within the family, especially later in life.\n5. Women\u2019s lives focus primarily on the domestic realm where they work long hours every\nday to care for the men, children, elderly, and sick, and do the cooking, cleaning, washing,\nmending,  water  carrying,  and  so  on.  Rural  women  also  make  significant  contributions  to\nagricultural work (planting, weeding, watering, harvesting, and preserving) and/or earn small\namounts of money through livestock raising, selling eggs or milk, embroidery, and other crafts\nthat can be worked on as time is available. These are rendered more difficult in absence of\nbasic  infrastructure  such  as  drinking  water,  sanitation,  rural  roads,  and  irrigation.  Their\neconomic contributions are misunderstood and underreported. Women in urban centers have\nbetter access to services and may become teachers or doctors, but opportunities to work\ndepend upon the opinions of their parents-in-law. Nuclear households are increasingly common\n                  \n1 Mahbub Ul Haq Centre for Human Development.1999. A Profile of Poverty in Pakistan. Islamabad.", "Appendix 4, page 2   \n55\nin cities as well-to-do women seek to establish their own homes where they can exercise some\nauthority earlier in life.\n6. Women  are  poorer,  less  healthy,  and  less  educated  than  men.  The  60-year  life\nexpectancy of women is the same as men, making Pakistan one of the very few countries\nwhere women do not outlive men. Only about half of the rural population have access to clean\nwater and only 20 percent have access to proper sanitation facilities. Literacy and school\nenrollment rates for girls and women, especially in rural areas, are significantly lower than for\nmen and compare unfavorably with most of the world. In many rural areas less than 10 percent\nof women are literate. Women suffer chronic malnutrition and anemia because of frequent\nchildbearing.\n7. Over 80 percent of farmers have less than 5.0 hectares of land, thus, demand for\nseasonal labor is minimal. Deforestation of upland areas has caused soil erosion, which has\ncontributed  to  clogged  reservoirs  and  irrigation  systems,  and  increased  risk  of  flooding,\nwaterlogging, and soil salinity. Work traditionally done by some artisans is increasingly replaced\nby  new  technologies  as  well.  Most  rural  families  have  added  secondary  occupations  or\nbranched out from traditional roles into related work. Rural-urban migration has been continuous\nfrom the 1960s onward and is now about 1.3 percent per year.\n8. The  poor  seek  opportunities  in  animal  husbandry,  small-scale  manufacturing,  food\nprocessing, and labor and services for cash. Information about distant markets and new forms\nof activity is scarce, and the risk entailed in starting little known enterprises is simply too high for\nthose with few assets and many dependents. Difficulty in obtaining credit further restricts their\noptions.  Both  resources  and  facilities  to  acquire  skills  to  diversify  into  new  activities  are\ninadequate. No effective risk mitigation mechanism is accessible to the poor. Illiteracy adds to\ntheir disadvantages.\n9. The poor need cash for consumption as well as for investment. Events like illness,\nespecially of a working man, provision of dowry for marriage of a daughter, damage to homes or\nlands from monsoon rains, food shortages, and funeral expenses present special challenges.\nSmall loans can be taken for short periods from friends, relatives, and neighbors, but several\nmay be required to meet one expense and social obligations may be weighty. Loans are\ncommonly taken from agricultural commission agents who return at harvest to accept in-kind\nrepayment.  Prices at harvest are the lowest, and agents may insist upon prices as much as 35\npercent lower to cover their costs, leaving farmers with little to live on during the next season.\nThe poor rarely borrow from moneylenders who require tangible assets like land, jewelry,\nlivestock, or homes.  Interest rates are at least 50 percent per annum plus use of the mortgaged\nasset. Loans from landlords may lead entire families into bonded labor for generations. Women\nwith no assets such as jewelry from their marriages and, typically, no identification card, have\nan extremely difficult time securing loans, especially from official sources.\n10. Recent  efforts  to  develop  microfinance  have  revealed  significant  demand  for  both\nsavings and credit services. The poor are concerned with quality as well as the cost of services.\nThey want small loans that are easy to obtain, to invest in feasible, local income-generating\nactivities. They want to save and repay in frequent small sums, preferably without incurring cost\nfor travel in the process. As women are rarely able to travel to banks located in towns, mobile\nservices, sometimes organized by the nongovernment organizations, are especially important\nfor  them.  However,  such  nongovernment  organizations  are  very  few.  While  demand  for\nmicrofinance is high, its poverty reduction impact is constrained due to lack of supporting\ninvestments in skills development, women empowerment, and basic infrastructure.", "Appendix 5\n56\nNATIONAL RURAL SUPPORT PROGRAM\n1.  The National Rural Support Program (NRSP) was established in November 1991 as a\nnongovernment organization (NGO) and registered under the Companies Ordinance of 1984 to\nundertake development activities in the rural areas of Pakistan. NRSP\u2019s operations cover 28\ndistricts in all four provinces, and Azad Kashmir. NRSP is now the largest NGO in the country,\nwith 15 regional offices that coordinate the activities of field unit offices. NRSP aims to foster a\ncountrywide network of community organizations (COs) at the grassroots level. Through these\nCOs, rural communities are able to plan, implement, and manage their development plans\nindependently  for  the  purpose  of  ensuring  productive  employment,  poverty  reduction,  and\nimprovement in quality of life.\n2.  COs comprise community members from 25 to 30 households who meet regularly to\ndiscuss issues, construct plans, and arrive at decisions by consensus. As of June 1999, NRSP\nformed 5,224 male COs, 1,975 all-women COs, and 625 COs with mixed membership. Of the\ntotal membership of 192,903, about 50,000 were women. COs involved in credit and enterprise\ndevelopment numbered 5,056. As of end 1999, NRSP had disbursed PRs1.78 billion ($32\nmillion) to 106,720 accounts, with an average credit size of PRs16,657 ($297). There are\n45,000 outstanding loan accounts. The repayment rate was 94 percent. Savings mobilized from\nmembers amounted to PRs235 million ($4.2 million).1 Along with credit NRSP offers training\ncourses, such as for managerial, technical, vocational, refresher, social, and gender aspects to\nenhance skills of the CO members to enable them to use their human capital more efficiently. Of\nthe total 49,988 persons trained by June 1999, 12,235 were females.\n3. NRSP  also  assists  CO  members  to  enhance  agricultural  productivity  through\ndemonstrations and training. It encourages and assists them in obtaining better varieties of\nseeds, fruits, forest plants, and livestock. It promotes improved methods of vaccination of\nanimals, sowing of seed, and plantation management. Most of these activities are undertaken\nthrough linkages with the Government line departments. A total of 646,594 households have\nbenefited from natural resource management activities. NRSP helps COs to establish and\nmanage physical infrastructure such as drinking water supply schemes, link roads, bridges, and\nlining of irrigation channels. The CO shares the cost by providing labor and other inputs in kind\nand operates and maintains the project after completion. A total of 1,961 schemes have been\ncompleted benefiting 41,691 households.\n4. NRSP has supported COs to establish and manage non-formal primary schools. NRSP\nbears part of the cost and provides teachers training. NRSP also trains CO members as health\nworkers, and fosters linkages between COs and service delivery agencies of the Government,\nNGOs, and the private sector for primary health care and reproductive health. Community\nschools established number 233, with 345 teachers and 8,541 students.\n5. NRSP received an endowment of PRs500 million ($9 million) from the Government to\ncover cost of operation. It reported a net surplus before tax of PRs36 million ($0.64 million) for\n1999. NRSP obtained a credit line from a commercial bank at a markup of 14 percent per\nannum to finance its credit operations. NRSP charges 18 percent markup for its microcredit\noperations. While costs have not been desegregated, NRSP incurs a net loss on its microcredit\noperations.\n                  \n1  These however, cannot be recycled as loans and have to be deposited with a commercial bank.

The Microfinance Bank (MFB) will provide sustainable microfinance (MF) services to the\npoor,  particularly  poor  women,  to  mitigate  poverty  and  promote  social  development  and\neconomic justice through community building and social mobilization. MFB was established on 6\nAugust 2000 through a statute.\n2. MFB\u2019s strategy is to transfer and build up human, social, and physical capital for the\npoor in an efficient and sustainable manner. MFB will provide affordable financial services,\nincluding savings, credit, leasing, money transfer, and risk mitigation to poor households to\nincrease their consumption and augment their income-generating assets. Social intermediation1\nwill precede and accompany financial services to ensure that social and gender dimensions of\npoverty are adequately addressed. MFB methodology and products will have a strong gender\nbias.  Forty  percent  of  MFB  staff  and  clients  will  be  women.  MFB  will  combine  the  core\ncompetency of a range of institutions to provide cost-effective services to the poor.\nB. Ownership and Corporate Governance\n3. The authorized share capital of MFB is PRs5 billion ($89 million). Its paid-up capital of\nPRs1.7 billion ($30 million) has been subscribed2 by 3 state-owned commercial banks (PRs900\nmillion), 11 private commercial banks (PRs700 million), and 2 foreign banks (PRs100 million).\nThe maximum single shareholding is 23 percent. MFB will be a majority privately held institution\nas the privatization of two state-owned commercial bank shareholders is in an advance stage.\n4. The  eight-member  MFB  board  has  three  representatives  from  the  nongovernment\norganizations (NGO), including the chairperson, and two women directors. Four other directors\nrepresent banks. The chairperson is an internationally recognized poverty specialist. He is also\nthe chairperson of the National Rural Support Program (NRSP), the largest NGO in the country\n(Appendix 5).

MFB will be supervised and regulated by the State Bank of\nPakistan (SBP), the central bank, under a specific regulatory framework. In addition, separate\nrules have been framed to ensure good corporate governance. External auditors will audit MFB,\nand reports will be published.\nC. Organization\n6. MFB will have a decentralized structure to maximize efficiency and coordination with\nNGOs. MFB operates from its head office located in Islamabad. It has commenced operations in\nSindh (Jacobabad district) and Punjab (Dera Ghazhi Khan district) provinces. One branch each\nin Balochistan and North-West Frontier provinces will be operational by year end. Under the\n                  \n1 Improving the conditions for the excluded to access finance, for example, through grassroots training in group\nformation, and vocational and financial skills.\n2 Private commercial banks: Allied Bank, Askari Bank, Bank Al-Habib, Bolan Bank, Metropolitan Bank, Muslim\nCommercial Bank, Platinum Commercial Bank, Prime Bank, Prudential Commercial Bank, Soneri Bank, and Union\nBank; State-owned commercial banks: Habib Bank, National Bank of Pakistan, and United Bank; and Foreign\nbanks: Citibank, and Standard Chartered Bank.", "Appendix 7, page 2\n59\npresident, the head office has four divisions (Figure A7). Each MFB branch will operate as a\nprofit center with performance measured against a set of financial indicators. Remuneration to\nMFB staff and fees for NGO service providers will be performance-based to achieve portfolio\nquality and community capacity.\n7. During its first year of operation, MFB will work in partnership with the NRSP. Later the\npartnership will be extended to include other NGOs. MFB will start operating by assuming3 the\nloan portfolio of PRs450 million ($8 million), subject to valuation, and about 45,000 borrowers\nfrom  NRSP,  as  well  as  PRs243  million  ($4.3  million)  in  deposits  mobilized  from  1,900\ncommunity organizations (COs) developed by NRSP. MFB will hire 50 NRSP staff. At the end of\nyear six, MFB will have 7 control branches, 34 branches with mobile units, and 1,506 staff.\nD. Operating Procedures\n8. COs will be the point of delivery for both financial and social services. MFB will mobilize\nthe poor into COs through NGO service providers. The formation of COs and service delivery\nwill  follow  procedures  (Appendix  8,  Figure  A8)  similar  to  those  successfully  developed  by\nNGOs. Credit will be available to CO members who have received capacity building inputs. MFB\nwill also give loans to individuals on a selective basis. MFB and the NGOs will regularly review\nand coordinate their respective activities. Mobile units traveling on a regular schedule to villages\nfrom MFB regional and branch offices will service customers. Mobile units will facilitate women\u2019s\naccess to financial services. Jeeps/pickups and drivers will be provided for women field officers.\nE. Services and Products\n1. Social\n9. All 560,000 members of 24,750 COs mobilized by MFB through NGOs will receive\ntraining on social awareness, selection of economic activities, women empowerment, basic\nliteracy, and financial products and services. About 40 percent of COs will be women-only COs.\nCO activists, especially women, will undergo capacity building in vocational skills, community\nmanagement,  and  leadership.  The  costs  will  be  funded  from  the  interest  revenue  of  the\nMicrofinance  Social  Development  Fund  (Appendix  8)  and  partly  by  MFB.  Community\ninfrastructure grants will be provided on a cost-sharing basis to 4,500 COs from the Community\nInvestment Fund (Appendix 9). NGOs will provide these services.\n2. Financial\n10. Savings. MFB will develop a range of savings instruments that will be attractive to rural\ncommunities. Emphasis will be placed on ready and convenient access to savings by individuals\nthrough the use of windows in bank branches and mobile units. In many areas, MFB will be the\nonly  depository  institution  to  provide  access  to  savings  facilities  to  the  poor.  Savings  will  be\ncollected from CO members as part of their eligibility to become borrowers and later as a self-\nsupporting  service.  Depositors  will  be  paid  competitive  interest  rate  on  deposits.  Deposits\nmobilized by MFB will be partly protected by the Deposit Protection Fund (Appendix 11).\n11. Microcredit. In particular, small-sized short-term loans, loans for livestock, and home\nindustries will be promoted. Loan size will be up to PRs20,000 (about $350) for the first loan.\n                  \n3 Once the existing loans are repaid to NRSP by the clients, fresh loans will be from MFB funds. MFB, subject to its\nboard approval, can also purchase the existing portfolio at a mutually agreed discount/premium.", "Appendix 7, page 3\n60\nRepayments  will  be  in  equated  monthly  installments.  The  estimated  lending  rate  to\nsubborrowers is 18 percent per annum.4\n12.  Microleasing.  MFB  will  provide  microleasing  services  to  individuals  or  cluster  of\nborrowers  (e.g.,  livestock  leases)  who  show  entrepreneurship.  All  assets  financed  will  be\ninsured under general insurance by MFB and insurance premia built into monthly rentals.\n13. Risk Mitigation. The Risk Mitigation Fund (Appendix 10) will assist the MFB borrowers\nin case of loss of income-generating assets due to unforeseen circumstances.\nF.  Projected Performance\n14. SBP, MFB, and NGOs have sequenced financial and social intermediation functions\nwhile projecting the performance of MFB.5 Projections reflect the concern for affordability of poor\nhouseholds, viability of MFB, and expansion of the MF market. By year 6, MFB will have\n560,000 borrowers and savers and about 80,000 nonborrower savers. The net outstanding loan\nat PRs7,430 million ($133 million) at year 6 will be funded by Asian Development Bank (ADB)\ncredit line of PRs3,808 million ($68 million), and the balance from equity of PRs1,869 million\n($33 million), deposits of PRs1,740 million ($31 million), and commercial and other borrowings\n(Table. A7.1 and Table A7.2). MFB is structured to outsource social intermediation functions\nand will be able to attain a viable financial intermediation function in year 4 with a profit of PRs8\nmillion. Early profitability is diminished by the increase in branching structure, and small loan\nsize of first-time subborrowers.\nG.  Risks and Safeguards\n15. MFB is most vulnerable to increases in loan losses and reductions in loan revenues. The\nrisk  of  delinquency  has  been  addressed  through  social  collateral,  continuous  monitoring,\nadoption  of  successful  practices,  loan  loss  provisions,  and  autonomy  of  operations.  As  a\npositive incentive for better performance MFB will be able to access support from Microfinance\nSocial Development Fund, Community Investment Fund, and the Project credit line only if it\nmeets the agreed performance benchmarks (Table A7.3).\n                  \n4 This will vary with scale of operations, changes in cost of funds, efficiency, etc.\n5 Conservatism has been applied in projections. The assumptions include (i) cost of ADB credit line at 7 percent per\nannum (p.a.), commercial borrowings at 14 percent p.a., and deposit at 7 percent p.a.; (ii) lending interest rate of\n18 percent p.a.; (iii) loan loss provision of 4 percent of net outstanding loans, and write-off after two years; (iv)\nadditional provision as percent of net profit for Reserve Fund  (20 percent), Social Sector Fund (10 percent),\nDeposit Protection Fund (5 percent), and Risk Mitigation Fund (5 percent); (v) statutory liquidity and cash reserve\nof 10 percent of deposits; (vi) income tax at 30 percent of net profit has been applied even though currently MFB is\ntax exempt; (vii) part of the fixed assets financed from project funds; (viii) social intermediation cost treated and\nfunded separately for the first 6 years; and (ix) inflation factor of 6 percent on administrative expenses. Deposit\nmobilization is projected based on the average deposit size of about PRs2,250 ($40) for borrowers and PRs6,000\n($107) for nonborrowers at year 6.", " \nFigure A7:  Organization Structure of

Demand for microfinance (MF) services from the poor is accompanied with the need for\nintensive and sustained investments in social preparation, particularly to enhance outreach to\npoor  women.  Without  such  investments,  the  poverty  reduction  potential  of  MF  diminishes.\nInadequate  social  preparation  adversely  affects  the  cohesion  of  groups  or  community\norganizations (COs), usually the point of MF service delivery. Thus, the quality of loan portfolio\nand,  ultimately,  program  sustainability  are  also  affected.  Without  incorporating  social  and\ngender dimensions in products and services, it is difficult to reach the poorer among the poor.\nHowever, doing so is costly, and its public good nature makes it difficult to attract investments\nfor building social capital. Attempts to include social intermediation costs in the interest rate\ncharged to the poor, on the other hand, leaves very little, if any, for their consumption and asset\nbuild up. Therefore, support must be provided to microfinance institutions (MFIs) at least until\noperations  reach  a  point  where  economies  of  scale  enable  absorption  of  such  costs.\nInvestments in social intermediation serve both the larger social goals and the expansion of the\nMF market.\nB. Objective\n2. The objective of the Microfinance Social Development Fund (MSDF) is to enhance\nsocial  capital1  through   a  collaborative  effort  of  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),\nMicrofinance Bank (MFB), and other MFIs licensed by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) by (i)\nmobilizing the poor into COs through a participatory process; (ii) enhancing capacity of CO\nmembers for community mobilization, social awareness, and selection and management of\nincome-generating  activities;  (iii)  developing  skills  and  providing  basic  literacy  training  for\nleaders of COs in community management skills; and (iv) providing training to women in rural\ncommunities  to  enhance  their  leadership  quality  and  participation  in  social  and  financial\nservices. These interventions are meant to strengthen the COs, which serve as delivery points\nfor financial and social services, and promotes social and economic vitality.2\nC. Funding and Management\n3. As part of the Microfinance Sector Development Program, MSDF was established in the\nSBP with an initial contribution from MFB; the Government will contribute $40 million equivalent\nover the next three years by dedicating part of the counterpart funds of the policy loan. In\naddition, MFB will earmark 10 percent of its profit after taxes3 to fund the social intermediation\ncosts. MSDF has been established for 25 years to provide a long-term source of funding for\nsocial intermediation to expand the MF market.\n                  \n1  In practice strengthening the social capital of the poor largely means increasing opportunities for their participation\nin the workings of the society where social cohesion is weak and poor suffer from systemic social exclusion.\nIncreasing economic opportunities and creating participatory institutions/mechanisms are required to enhance\nsocial  capital.  The  promotion  of  community  based  groups  to  undertake  MF,  health,  and  natural  resource\nmanagement (Appendix 9) is an important first step in this direction.\n2 Connections among government, civil society, and private sector organizations at national and local levels, and\nbetween these and citizens groups are highly conducive to social and economic vitality. Where reciprocity is the\nnorm, even very poor people have a source of help when faced with difficulty. A balance between local (or\nhorizontal/bonding)  relationships  within  communities  and  external  (or  vertical/bridging)  relationships  with  the\ngovernment or other organizations promotes a positive blend of stability.\n3  MFB is currently tax exempt.", "Appendix 8, page 2\n66\n4. MSDF will be managed in accordance with MSDF Rules 2000. The initial contribution\nwill be invested by SBP in approved securities and the revenue generated will be credited in an\nMSDF  income  account  to  meet  expected  expenses.  The  MSDF  income  account  will  be\nmanaged by a fund committee comprising the MFB president as the chairperson, one nominee\nof SBP, and one MFB director. The meetings of the fund committee will be minuted. The fund\nsecretariat located in MFB will deal with administrative matters. Administrative expenses are\ncapped at 0.5 percent of the revenue generated by MSDF. MSDF and the MSDF income\naccount will be audited and the report will be made public.\n5. MSDF will be a dedicated facility for MFB for the first three years, later MFIs licensed by\nSBP will also be eligible for support. MSDF will only support services delivered through NGOs\nthat meet the qualifying criteria and enter into partnership agreement with MFB. The agreement\nwill detail the type, location, duration of services, and expected results including gender-related\ntargets. Reimbursement claims will be made by MFB to the fund secretariat with documentary\nevidence of having engaged an eligible NGO and satisfactory completion of the service. If the\neligible expense claim from MFB is less than the interest revenue of MSDF, the balance will be\nreinvested in MSDF, and when expenses exceed the interest revenue, the same will be borne\nby MFB. MFB\u2019s direct costs will not be reimbursed. The Fund Committee will periodically review\nthe price of services provided by NGOs.\nD. Support for Social Intermediation\n6. The revenue from MSDF will mobilize 560,000 poor in 24,750 communities in 6 years\nthrough the NGOs. All the poor organized in COs will be provided capacity building support.\nOne activist from each CO, a total of 24,750 activists, will attend four days of community\nmanagement skills training. To enhance the participation of women, 12,412 women activist of\nCOs will attend a 3-day activist capacity enhancement course. Ten percent of women activists,\na total of 1,240 members will attend a 10-day leadership management skills training course. In\naddition, annual two-day workshops, 1,409 during MSDP duration, will be held for all CO\nactivists.\nE. Formation of Community Organizations\n7. The process of forming COs has been charted in Figure A8. Steps 1 to 9 of CO\nformation can take as little as 15 days where people have some familiarity with the process, and\nsix weeks or more otherwise. On average, the whole process takes 4 to 5 months. MFB selects\nnew locations with the assistance of the NGOs, which are contracted to undertake steps 1\nthrough 9 with the involvement of MFB staff. While the MFB staff will be present at the very start\nof CO formation, the staff will become increasingly involved from step 5 onward, and be fully\ninvolved from step 11 onward. MFB and service provider NGOs will meet quarterly to review\nand coordinate their respective activities.\nF. MSDF Revenues\n8. MSDF will generate about $20.0 million (Table A8) during the 6-year project duration to\nmeet the entire cost of social intermediation (including contingencies) estimated at $20.0 million.\nIn  the  subsequent  years,  MSDF  revenues  will  be  insufficient  to  meet  the  expected  social\nintermediation costs. The gap will then be met by MFB. MSDF is expected to generate $37\nmillion over 10 years, and approximately $100 million over its 25-year term.", "Figure A8: Formation of Community Organization and Delivery of Microfinance Services

Government interventions have had suboptimal impact as the\nservices were not delivered in a participatory manner. In addition, women were seldom involved\nin service delivery.\nB. Objective\n2. The objective of the Community Investment Fund (CIF) is to increase the access of poor\ncommunities to infrastructure for improving their livelihoods through efficient and productive use\nof local resources. The involvement of local stakeholders in identifying, planning, executing, and\nmonitoring  community  infrastructure  projects  will  empower  them,  particularly  women.\nParticipatory processes leading to subproject investment, maintenance, and use will enhance\nsocial capital through the formation of cohesive community organizations (COs) that could\neffectively be used to deliver microfinance services and expand the microfinance market.\nC. Funding and Management\n3. CIF is established for 25 years in the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to provide a long-\nterm  source  of  funding  for  community  infrastructure  projects  in  conjunction  with  social\nintermediation activities supported by the Microfinance Social Development Fund (MSDF). The\nMicrofinance Bank (MFB) has made an initial contribution. The Government will contribute $20\nmillion equivalent over the next three years by dedicating part of the counterpart funds of the\npolicy loan. CIF will be managed in accordance with CIF Rules 2000, and operated on principles\nsimilar to MSDF (Appendix 8). CIF will be a dedicated facility for MFB for the first three years,\nlater other microfinance institutions licensed by SBP will also be covered.\nD. Criteria for Financing Community Infrastructure Subprojects\n4. CIF  will  grant-finance,  on  a  cost-sharing  basis,  small-scale  community-level\ninfrastructure subprojects, mainly civil works, which will benefit the poor. Eligible COs are those\nthat  have  been  mobilized  for  or  by  MFB.  Eligible  subprojects  will  be  those  that  are  not\nimmediately bankable, are beyond the financing scope of the poor, or do not fall immediately\nunder  government  programs.  Grant  funding  for  a  CO  is  limited  to  PRs150,000  or  about\nPRs7,000 per participating household. Subprojects will be selected on the basis of equitable\ndistribution  of  benefits  and  sustainability  as  determined  by  the  CO\u2019s  willingness  to  make\narrangements for operation and maintenance, including recovery of costs if any. At least 80\npercent of CO members must sign the subproject agreement, with no objections from remaining\nmembers, to implement and maintain the subproject. The CO must contribute at least 40\npercent of the total cost and full costs of subsequent operation and maintenance. Subprojects\nmust be capable of completion within 12 months. An indicative flow chart is in Figure A9.\nE. CIF Revenue Utilization\n5. CIF will generate $9.3 million (Table A9) during the project duration to finance about\n4,500 community infrastructure subprojects.

The disadvantages of the poor households include lack of access to financial services,\nunfair terms of participation in the local economy, and vulnerability to economic and physical\ndownturns. As a result, poor households forego potentially viable new technologies, production\nchoices, and income opportunities due to risk aversion. A risk mitigation facility that effectively\ntargets the poor is not available. Poor, do not have other sources of funds to restart their failed\nlivelihood projects to repay debts, thus indebtedness takes over.\nB. Objective and Funding\n2. As part of the Microfinance Sector Development Program, the Risk Mitigation Fund\n(RMF) was established by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) as a safety net to mitigate the risks\nassociated with vulnerability of the poor to loss of income generating assets acquired through\nMicrofinance Bank (MFB) loan. MFB has made an initial contribution and the Government will\ncontribute  $5  million  equivalent  as  a  grant  from  the  counterpart  funds  of  the  policy  loan.\nRecurring contributions will be made to RMF out of the spread between the cost of project funds\nto the Government and the relending rate charged to MFB by the Government. Half of this\nspread will be contributed to RMF. In addition, MFB will contribute up to 5 percent of its net\nprofit after taxes.1 RMF will be a dedicated facility for MFB borrowers.\nC. Management\n3. RMF will be managed by the Microfinance Support Division of SBP in accordance with\nthe RMF Rules, 2000. Contributions to RMF will be invested in instruments approved by SBP.\nIndependent auditors will audit RMF and the report will be made public. The impact of RMF on\nthe  risk  profile  of  the  poor  households  will  be  assessed.  MFB  and  SBP  will  determine\nconversion of RMF into an actuarial-based system in consultation with Asian Development\nBank.\nD. Risk Mitigation\n4. Assistance from RMF will be provided to the borrowers of MFB for the repurchase of\nassets to generate income and repay their debts. Assistance from RMF will be available to\nmembers of community organizations after three fourths of the members of the community\norganization certify the need for such assistance for the individual, and the field officer of MFB\nverifies the same. Claims will be submitted periodically by MFB to Microfinance Support Division\nwith evidence that due diligence has been carried out. SBP, if it deems fit, can verify such\nclaims. RMF will not be used in any manner to liquidate loans written off or loan losses due to\nwillful nonpayment of borrowers, or due to negligence on the part of MFB staff. Assistance will\nonly be admissible up to the available RMF balance.\nE. Projected Compensation\n5. During the 6-year project duration RMF revenues (Table A10) can potentially mitigate\nthe risk of 27,000 poor households keeping the principal fund intact.\n                  \n1 MFB is currently tax exempt.", "Table A10:  Projected Utilization of Risk Mitigation Fund \n($'000)\nSubtotal Total\nItem 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 6 Years a 2007 2008 2009 2010 10 Years\nRisk Mitigation Fund (RMF) - Opening Balance 18.3  5,000.0  5,000.0  5,000.0  5,000.0  5,000.0  5,000.0  5,000.0  5,000.0  5,000.0 \nRMF - Initial Contributionsb  17.9  5,000.0  5,017.9  5,017.9 \nRMF - Subsequent Contributions\nSpread Revenue Allocation c 44.5  211.0  564.0  1,284.0  1,974.5  2,109.0  6,187.0  2,183.5  2,271.0  2,266.0  2,239.5  15,147.0 \nMicrofinance Bank (MFB) Contribution d   12.0  96.0  108.0  162.0  227.0  262.0  302.0  1,061.0 \nSubtotal  44.5  211.0  564.0  1,284.0  1,986.5  2,205.0  6,295.0  2,345.5  2,498.0  2,528.0  2,541.5  16,208.0 \nRMF Interest Revenue (10.0%) e 0.4  254.0  513.7  538.8  592.4  663.5  709.6  3,272.4  727.5  742.2  751.3  753.5  6,246.9  7\n3\nAdministration Expenses\nRMF Administration (0.50%)f 0.0  1.3  2.6  2.7  3.0  3.3  3.5  16.4  3.6  3.7  3.8  3.8  31.2 \nRMF Closing Balance (Before Compensation) 18.3  5,315.6  5,722.1  6,100.1  6,873.4  7,646.7  7,911.0  14,569.0  8,069.4  8,236.5  8,275.5  8,291.2 \nIndicative Compensation Amount 315.6  722.1  1,100.1  1,873.4  2,646.7  2,911.0  9,569.0  3,069.4  3,236.5  3,275.5  3,291.2  22,441.6 \nRMF Closing Balance (After Compensation) 18.3  5,000.0  5,000.0  5,000.0  5,000.0  5,000.0  5,000.0  5,000.0  5,000.0  5,000.0  5,000.0  5,000.0 \nRMF Indicators\nClients Compensated (number) g 1,443 2,300 3,417 5,623 7,670 8,115 26,675 8,263 8,447 8,328 8,197 59,910 \nClients Compensated as Percent of Total (%) 4.9% 3.8% 3.0% 3.0% 2.8% 2.2% 1.8% 1.6% 1.3% 1.2%\na Project implementation period.

Although small in amount, the savings of the poor relative to their income is substantial.\nPoor depositors need easy accessibility and assurance of safety of their deposits, both of which\nhave generally not been available. In the recent past, the poor have lost their savings with the\nfailure of cooperatives, and frauds in finance companies. While the deposits of the state-owned\ncommercial banks, to which the poor have very little access, are implicitly guaranteed, no such\ncover is yet available for private sector commercial banks. Microfinance Bank (MFB) will be a\nmajority privately held bank when the two state-owned banks with equity participation in MFB\nare privatized. The MFB ordinance provides for the protection of MFB depositors as a matter of\nprudence as well as a safety net measure for the poor. This is also intended to enhance the\ncredibility of MFB to mobilize deposits from the nonpoor.\nB. Objective and Funding\n2. As part of the Microfinance Sector Development Program, the Deposit Protection Fund\n(DPF) was established by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to provide protection to the savings\nin the event of MFB liquidation. MFB has made an initial contribution and the Government is\ncommitted to contribute $5 million equivalent as a grant from the counterpart funds of the policy\nloan. The Government will make recurring contributions to DPF from the spread between the\ncost of project funds to the Government and the relending rate charged to MFB. Half of this\nspread will be contributed to DPF. In addition, MFB will contribute up to 5 percent of its net profit\nafter taxes.1 DPF will be a dedicated facility for MFB depositors.\nC. Management\n3. DPF will be managed by the Microfinance Support Division of SBP in accordance with\nthe DPF Rules, 2000. Contributions to DPF will be invested in instruments approved by SBP.\nIndependent auditors will audit DPF, and the report will be made public. The impact of DPF on\nmobilizing savings of the poor as well as from the nonpoor will be assessed. MFB and SBP will\ndetermine  conversion  of  DPF  into  an  actuarial-based  system  in  consultation  with  Asian\nDevelopment Bank, or MFB could join a deposit insurance scheme as and when it becomes\navailable at favorable terms.\nD. Deposit Protection\n4. DPF will provide protection to depositors who have maintained deposits with MFB for\ntwo consecutive years. SBP will periodically assess the extent of coverage possible and ensure\nthat DPF is not used in any manner other than its objective. SBP, in the unlikely event of\nliquidation of MFB, will process claims of depositors.\nE. Projected Revenues\n5. At the end of the 6-year project the estimated DPF balance (Table A11) is $16.0 million,\nor about 50 percent of MFB deposit. The DPF balance is expected to be $35 million by year 10.\n                  \n1 MFB is currently tax exempt.", "Table A11:  Projected Utilization of Deposit Protection Fund \n($'000)\nSubtotal Total\nItem       2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 6 Years a 2007 2008 2009 2010 10 Years\nDeposit Protection Fund (DPF) - Opening Balance   18.3  5,315.6  6,053.4  7,221.6  9,258.0  12,227.0  15,709.4  19,671.2  24,170.3  29,129.5 \nDPF - Initial Contributionsb  17.9  5,000.0  5,017.9  5,017.9 \nDPF - Subsequent Contributions\nSpread Revenue Allocation c   44.5  211.0  564.0  1,284.0  1,974.5  2,109.0  6,187.0  2,183.5  2,271.0  2,266.0  2,239.5  15,147.0 \nMicrofinance Bank (MFB) Contribution d   12.0  96.0  108.0  162.0  227.0  262.0  302.0  1,061.0 \nSubtotal 44.5  211.0  564.0  1,284.0  1,986.5  2,205.0  6,295.0  2,345.5  2,498.0  2,528.0  2,541.5  16,208.0 \n7\nDPF Interest Revenue (10.0%) e 0.4  254.0  529.5  607.2  756.2  987.5  1,283.8  4,418.6  1,624.3  2,011.2  2,443.4  2,918.5  13,416.0  5 \nAdministration Expenses\nDPF Administration Charge (0.5%) f 1.3  2.6  3.0  3.8  4.9  6.4  22.1  8.1  10.1  12.2  14.6  67.1 \nDPF Closing Balance 18.3  5,315.6  6,053.4  7,221.6  9,258.0  12,227.0  15,709.4  15,709.4  19,671.2  24,170.3  29,129.5  34,574.9  \nDPF Indicators\nDPF as Percentage of MFB Deposits 0.4% 104.1% 93.6% 78.7% 66.9% 58.2% 51.2% 51.2% 44.7% 40.3% 37.0% 34.3%\na Project implementation period.

Introduction\n1. Financial analysis of Microfinance Bank (MFB) and small microfinance institutions (MFIs)\nwere  carried  out.  In  addition,  financial  and  economic  analysis  of  indicative  subborrower\ninvestments to be financed by the Project, was performed to ensure that the investments have\nthe  potential  to  generate  sufficient  income  for  consumption  and  asset  buildup  of  poor\nhouseholds. Analysis of typical community infrastructure subprojects was also undertaken.\nB. Financial and Economic Analysis\n1. Microfinance Bank\n2. MFB is a viable financial institution in terms of being able to service liabilities and retain\nearnings sufficiently to maintain the equity base. By year 10 the capital to asset ratio is 16,\nreturn to equity 15 percent, and return to asset 2.3 percent (Table A18.1). These rates of\nreturns, while not high, are considered satisfactory. Interest on lending at 18 percent per annum\nconstitutes the major source of revenue. MFB profits will be reinvested for social intermediation,\nrisk mitigation, and deposit protection. While the cost of social intermediation will be funded from\nMicrofinance Social Development Fund (Appendix 8), MFB will meet an increasing proportion of\nsuch costs from its surpluses. The cost of community mobilization and capacity building amount\nto 4 percent of the net loan outstanding in year 6 and declines to 2.4 percent in year 10.\nTable A18.1: Microfinance Bank Key Indicators\nKey Indicators 2001 2004 2005 2006 2010\n1.

Microfinance Institutions (MFIs)\n3. A MFI startup threshold is 1,000 borrowers with a loan portfolio of about PRs17 million\n($300,000). Depending on loan portfolio at startup, and expected asset growth, a prospective\nMFI will need initial capital of PRs15-PRs25 million and access to additional capital in the\nfollowing years. Viability is likely in 5 years (Supplementary Appendix H) under assumptions\nsimilar to MFB. Four NGOs with substantive interest in MF having a client base of 1,000-4,000\nare considered as prospective applicants to operate as licensed MFIs.", "Appendix 18, page 2\n86\n3. Subborrower Investments\n4. To determine investment profitability and the effect of the Project on employment, 50\nprofiles were reviewed, and a sample selected representing 20 activities. Loan disbursements\nfor this weighted sample averaged PRs7,000 ($125) within a range of PRs1,500 ($27) to\nPRs50,000 ($892). The range in enterprise financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was 23 to 60\npercent, with a weighted average of 33.6 percent reducing to 25.5 percent after allowing for a 20\npercent  enterprise  failure  rate.  The  average  annual  operating  surplus  was  estimated  at\nPRs29,515 ($527). The average increase in labor days generated from new investments was 70\ndays representing a return per labor day of PRs437 (PRs350 after allowing for enterprise\nfailure) significantly above the current average rural wage rate of PRs80. After allowing for\nenterprise failure, the daily labor surplus of PRs350 represents an increase in the average\nhousehold income of PRs24,500 ($438). The profiles show that some moderately attractive\ninvestments are available to the rural poor that will have a positive impact on employment\ngeneration and household incomes (Table A18.2).\n5. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the sample income generating activities\nranged from a sector high of 33/34 percent (agricultural crops and manufacturing/processing) to\na sector low of 23 percent (services and trade). The weighted average EIRR was 27 and (Table\nA18.3).\n4. Community Infrastructure Projects\n6. Projects are mainly small civil works, including (i) roads and bridges (feeder tracks)\nproviding better access for communities to services; (ii) farm irrigation investments from ponds,\ndugwells,  and  diversion  canals;  (iii)  clean  domestic  water  supply  and  sewerage;  and  (iv)\nelectrification  (including  phone  and  internet  access  booths).  Community  organizations  will\ncontribute 40 percent of the initial capital cost and be responsible for any ongoing operation and\nmaintenance costs. Seven typical subprojects were analyzed (Table A18.4).\n7. Benefits from feeder tracks include reduced vehicle operating cost, savings from existing\nand generated trips, and a reduction in the cost of existing and generated goods transported.\nThe calculated FIRR was 21.5 percent and the EIRR was estimated at 22.5 percent. Three\ntypes  of  small-scale  community-managed  irrigation  schemes  were  considered,  namely\nindividual dugwell, gravity diversion, and pond irrigation. Incremental revenue to the schemes\nwould result from an increase in the cropping intensity combined with the introduction of higher\nvalue crops. The resulting FIRR ranged from 27.2 percent for pond, 20.4 percent for diversion,\nand  8.6 percent  for  dugwell  schemes,  and  the  EIRR  ranged  from  36.2 percent  for  pond,\n26.8 percent for diversion, and 21.1 percent for dugwell schemes.\n8. Two types of small-scale community-managed domestic water supply schemes were\nconsidered, namely gravity and hand-pump. Incremental benefits to the schemes would result\nfrom savings in family health expenditure and reduction in the time spent fetching water. The\nresulting FIRR ranged from 34.5 percent for gravity to 26.1 percent for hand-pump schemes and\nthe  EIRR  ranged  from  32.4 percent  and  26.6 percent,  respectively.  Benefits  from  the\nelectrification scheme include reduced energy delivery costs, household expenditure savings on\nalternative energy sources, and increased demand for electricity. The FIRR was 20.6 percent\nand EIRR 20.9 percent.", "            Table A18.2: Summary of Financial Analysis of Indicative Income-Generating Activities\n

During the 6-year project duration, the Microfinance Bank (MFB) will operate in 30\ndistricts containing 5 million households of which 2.80 million (56 percent) are poor and 1.74\nmillion (34 percent) are very poor. With continuing services to 560,000 households, MFB will\nreach about 9 percent of poor households in the country. MFB is projected to disburse about 1.6\nmillion loans over 6 years or about 270,000 borrowers per year. A household in the lowest\nincome decile will require continuous access to loan assistance for 4 to 5 years to raise monthly\nper capita income to cross the poverty threshold.1 A household in the income decile just below\nthe poverty line could be above the line within two years of project-stimulated investment. Direct\nbenefits are summarized in Table A20.\n2.  Financially, the Project supports loans to women. The cost of making loans to women,\nrelated to the need for vehicles, drivers, and higher employee turnover, is 1.4 percentage points\nhigher than for loans to men, assuming loan sizes are equal. An increase of 10 percent in\naverage loan size reduces the administrative cost of lending by 0.4 percentage points. To the\nextent that loan sizes to women will be smaller, women will receive transfer advantage as loan\ncharges will not be differentiated by gender.\n3.  In the formation and financing of Microfinance Social Development Fund (Appendix 8)\nfor $40 million, the Project will enable formation of 24,750 community organizations (COs) of\nwhich 40 percent will be for women. Through the COs, the Project will (i) provide a cost-effective\ndelivery point for the provision of small-scale financial services; (ii) encourage peer review of\nloan proposals, and enjoin responsibility for the repayment of loans to the benefit of the group;\n(iii)  support  the  development  of  social  skills  among  women,  including  basic  literacy  and\ncommunications within their society; (iv) inform women of their basic rights to own and manage\nassets, and facilitate the placement of these resources in their hands. These will foster a sense\nof empowerment through a participatory process and constitute an important step towards\nstrengthening social capital.\n4.  The establishment and support from Community Investment Fund (Appendix 9) will\nincrease the access of poor communities to basic infrastructure, to improve their livelihoods.\nThe involvement of COs in identifying, planning, executing, and monitoring of community-based\ninfrastructure will empower them and serve as an incentive to mobilize and strengthen COs to\nenhance  social  capital.  About  4,500  COs  will  be  able  to  get  assistance  from  Community\nInvestment  Fund,  which  is  designed  to  leverage  social  mobilization  and  capacity  building\nsupport from Microfinance Social Development Fund.\n5.  The establishment of Risk Mitigation Fund (Appendix 10) will reduce indebtedness of the\npoor due to failed enterprises and enable poor households to take advantage of potentially\nviable new technologies, production choices, and income opportunities. Risk Mitigation Fund\nhas the potential to assist about 27,000 poor households during the project period and is\nparticularly significant for remote areas with adverse agroclimatic patterns, tribal communities,\nand bonded labor, where chances of failures and losses are the highest. Deposit Protection\nFund (Appendix 11) secures the savings of the poor from any systemic or institutional failure.\nThis added protection will inculcate saving habits among the poor and promote savings in MFB\nwhich could be used for extending microcredit.\n                  \n1 The monthly per capita income of the households in the lowest income decile is about PRs200 (about $4). The\naverage annual household income of nonpoor in rural areas is about PRs52,000 ($928), and in urban areas about\nPRs85,000 ($1,517).", "90\nAppendix 20, page 2\nTable A20: Impact on Poverty\nChannel Direct Impact of Project Macro Nonpoor\nAccess to Poor Microfinance Services.\nReduces poverty as access to Legislative, regulatory, and Microfinance institutions\nmicrocredit enables investment supervisory environment will stimulate improved\nin income-generating activities created for the microfinance supply of financial\nleading to higher household sector will encourage entry of services, particularly\nincome.
