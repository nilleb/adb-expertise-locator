THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  additional  financing  of  the  Integrated  Rural \nDevelopment Sector Project in the Central Provinces.1 \n \n2.  The additional financing will scale up and expand investments in rural infrastructure in 6 \nof the 13 original project provinces over 4 years.2 The six provinces selected based on their \ngood implementation performance are Binh Dinh, Binh Thuan, Ha Tinh, Ninh Thuan, Phu Yen, \nand Thua Thien\u2013Hue. The additional financing will support the upgrading of underdeveloped or \noutdated productive rural infrastructure (PRI), thus increasing agricultural and rural productivity. \nIt  also  aims to  improve  the  integration  of strengthened  dams  and reservoirs,  primary  and \nsecondary  canals,  and  access  roads  to  facilitate  increased  agricultural  productivity  and \ndiversification and reduce vulnerability caused by natural disasters. This is consistent with the \napproach adopted by the ongoing Productive Rural Infrastructure Sector Project in the Central \nHighlands.3 It directly supports the Government of Viet Nam\u2019s National Target Program for New \nRural Development, 2010\u20132020, the National Water Resources Strategy, 2006\u20132020, and the \nrecent Prime Minister\u2019s decision to restructure agriculture.4 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  On 15 October 2007, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the project loan of \nSDR58,723,000  ($90  million  equivalent,  excluding  the  government  contribution  of  $24.8 \nmillion).5  Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement provided parallel financing with a \u20ac40 million \nloan ($52 million equivalent) and a \u20ac1.0 million grant ($1.3 million equivalent). The ADB loan \nwas declared effective on 6 May 2008. The initial project was to (i) improve rural livelihoods by \nincreasing agriculture productivity; (ii) widen employment opportunities; (iii) improve access to \nhealth, education, and safe drinking water; and (iv) reduce exposure to natural disasters by \nimproving deteriorated infrastructure.  \n \n4.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) is the executing agency. \nThe  central  project  management  unit  (CPMU)  established  within  the  Agriculture  Project \nManagement  Board  (APMB)  of  MARD  has  been  responsible  for  overall  national  project \nimplementation,  while  the  provincial  project  management  units  (PPMUs)  in  the  13  project \nprovinces have been responsible for day-to-day implementation. The project was implemented \nover 6 years and will close on 31 December 2014. At the time of the midterm review mission (11 \nMay\u20133 June 2011), a minor modification was made to the original target indicators set for \nimpacts and outcome in the design and monitoring framework to extend the impact evaluation \nperiod to 2016, and specify the baseline to measure the expected increased income. The \noriginal output indicator for rural roads was reduced to reflect the need for more irrigation \nsubprojects to enable water supply, expand irrigated areas for crop diversification, and minimize \nflood and drought risks. \n                                                \n1  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The provinces covered were (from north to south) Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua \nThien\u2013Hue, Quang Nam, QuangNgai, Kon Tum, Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, Ninh Thuan, and Binh Thuan. \n3  ADB. 2013.

Manila. \n ", "2   \n5.  Project performance. The project is considered to be performing well according to the \nadditional financing policy in ADB\u2019s Operations Manual.6 Despite the initial start-up delay, the \nproject is on track to achieve its intended outputs and outcomes. As of 24 August 2014 overall \nproject implementation progress was 99% against the elapsed loan period of 95%. All 129 \nintended subprojects were physically completed. Cumulative contract awards comprised 95.1% \nof the ADB net loan amount and disbursements 96.6%. The government has substantially \ncomplied with all covenanted safeguard requirements during implementation of subprojects. \n \n6.  In terms of achieving the revised output targets, the project rehabilitated 658 kilometers \nof  rural  roads  (122%);  and  irrigated  115,163  hectares  (105%)  of  agricultural  land  with  \n46 irrigation canals and drainage schemes, six rural water supply schemes (120%), 20 rural \nmarkets (111%), and nine flood protection schemes (225%). Appraisal estimates indicated more \nthan 400,000 hectares of irrigation facilities were in need of rehabilitation and about 25,000 \nkilometers of primary and secondary irrigation canals in need of lining. More than a third of the \nrural population did not have clean water supplies. The project has made a good contribution to \nmeeting the provincial infrastructure development targets. The monitoring data submitted by the \nCPMU and the PPMUs in December 2013 indicate the achievement of reduced travel and water \ncollection time, reduced vehicle operating costs, and increased rice and other crop production. \n \n7.  Additional support needed. Despite the achievements, much work is needed to reduce \ninfrastructure  constraints  to  production,  diversification,  and  economic  growth.  The  climate \nchange modeling study conducted by the World Bank indicates that the agro-ecological zones in \nthe six target provinces will encounter severe to very severe exposure to hydroclimatic risks. 7 \nFarmers in those areas are already adapting to changes in climate conditions and relying on \nvarious cropping strategies. The study recommends investment in improving and expanding \nirrigation infrastructure where opportunities for irrigation expansion are greatest in the central \nregion. Because dams and reservoirs are the backbone of irrigation systems, their safety is an \nurgent national concern. The government\u2019s National Socioeconomic Development Plan, 2011\u2013\n2016, National Target Program for New Rural Development (2010\u20132020), and the National \nWater  Resources  Strategy  (2006\u20132020)  recognize  the  dual  objective  of  rural  water \ninfrastructure. \n   \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The additional financing is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u2013\n2015  for  Viet  Nam.  The  impact  will  not  be  changed:  improved  livelihoods,  incomes,  and \nstandards of living for the region\u2019s rural population through increased agricultural productivity, \nwider employment opportunities, improved health and education, and reduced exposure to \n                                                \n6 ADB. 2011. Additional Financing. Operations Manual. OM H5/BP. Manila. The project meets the four eligibility \ncriteria for additional financing. First, the ADB review mission in 2012 and 2013 confirmed the satisfactory \nperformance of the original project. The review mission in December 2013 confirmed that the original project \nremains technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound. Second, the government accords high \npriority to the original project as proposed to be expanded through the additional financing. Additional financing will \nbe crucial in meeting the national priorities stated in National Target Program for New Rural Development, 2010\u2013\n2020, the National Water Resources Strategy, 2006\u20132020, and the recent Prime Minister\u2019s decision to restructure \nagriculture. Third, the additional financing scope is consistent with the project\u2019s development objective because the \nintended outcome and three outputs remain essentially the same except for output 2 relating to capacity building \nwhich was slightly modified to include agricultural training for farmers. Fourth, the additional financing supports the \ninclusive growth that is identified as a priority in the Country Partnership Strategy: Viet Nam, 2012\u20132015. Manila. \nThe additional financing meets the three criteria for priority consideration: (i) the project is performing well; (ii) there \nis a high degree of project readiness to implement the additional financing; and (iii) the additional financing has \ninnovative features that further reduce procurement risks, increase implementation efficiency, and increase project \nbenefits. \n7  World Bank. 2010. Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change in Viet Nam. Washington, DC. ", "    3 \nnatural disasters. The outcome statement remains the same, while the outcome indicators are \nmodified to adjust to the current socioeconomic conditions, consider direct contribution of the \nimproved PRI, and feasibility of data collection. 8 \n \nC.  Outputs \n9.  The three outputs are unchanged. The output statement related to capacity building is \nmodified to include agricultural training for farmers. Output indicators for the additional financing \nare (i) improved PRI; (ii) improved capacity of (a) national, provincial, district, and commune \nstaff in technical design; and (b) farmers in agricultural production techniques; and (iii) improved \nproject management skills for infrastructure development. Rehabilitation of water supply is not \nincluded in the additional financing as the focus was modified from general rural infrastructure \nsupport to improved irrigation system. \n \n10.  Activities  to  improve  PRI  include  civil  works  to  (i)  improve  irrigation  infrastructure \nincluding reservoirs and dams; (ii) upgrade river embankments and dikes for flood protection, \nsaline intrusion protection, and other purposes; and (iii) rehabilitate canal roads and access \nroads around the irrigation schemes. Bioengineering techniques for soil and water stabilization \nwill  be  adopted  to  promote  soil  and  water  conservation.  Twenty-four  subprojects  were \nprescreened and a feasibility study conducted for one subproject. A feasibility study will be \nconducted for each of the remaining 23 subprojects to determine their financial eligibility. One \nsubproject selection criterion is an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of at least 12%.9 \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n11.  The additional financing will support work estimated to cost $92.5 million. The overall \nproject is estimated to cost $260.6 million, including taxes and duties of $20.3 million (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Current Amounta  Additional Financinga  Revised Total \nA.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR55,024,000 ($85 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for the additional \nfinancing of the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, \nan interest rate of 2.0% per annum throughout the grace period and thereafter, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \n13.  The  financing  plan  is  in  Table  2.  The  ADB  loan  will  finance  100%  of  civil  works, \nequipment, taxes and duties associated with civil works and equipment,10 consultants, training, \ninterest during construction, and project management.11 The central government will provide \n$0.5 million and the participating provinces will provide a total of $7.0 million. The funds from the \ncentral government will finance part of the CPMU operating costs and training. To avoid a \nsubstantial  implementation  delay,  the  feasibility  study,  detailed  design  and  construction \nsupervision  consultants,  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  will  be  financed  by  the \ncounterpart fund from the provincial budget. Land acquisition and resettlement costs will also be \nfinanced by the counterpart fund from the provincial budget. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nCurrenta    Additional Financing    Total \nAmount  Share of  Amount  Share of  Amount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)  Total (%)  ($ million)  Total (%)  ($ million)  Total (%) \n           \nAsian Development Bank \nSpecial Funds resources  90.00  53.5  85.00  91.9  175.00  67.2 \n(loan) \nAFD loan  52.00  30.9  0.00  0.0  52.00  20.0 \nAFD grant  1.30  0.8  0.00  0.0  1.30  0.5 \nGovernment  24.80  14.8  7.50  8.1  32.30  12.5 \nTotal  168.10  100.0  92.50  100.0  260.60  100.0 \nAFD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement. \nNote: Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The implementation arrangements will be essentially the same as for the initial project \nexcept for the number of participating provinces. MARD continues as the executing agency and \ndelegates overall responsibility to its APMB. The CPMU established within APMB will continue \nto be responsible for central project coordination. The provincial people\u2019s committees of the six \nparticipating provinces will continue their overall responsibility for implementation coordination in \ntheir respective provinces. The PPMUs set up within district agriculture and rural development \ndepartments in each of the six project provinces will continue their responsibilities. \n                                                \n10  ADB will finance taxes and duties for civil works and equipment to avoid delay, ensure completion of the civil works, \nand realize the intended outcome and outputs within the proposed 4-year implementation period. The total cost of \ntaxes and duties to be financed by ADB is estimated at $6.5 million. The calculation of taxes and duties to be \nfinanced by ADB under the project is based on the following principles: (i) the amount of taxes and duties financed \nby the ADB loan does not represent an excessive share of the project investment plan and is in line with the \neligible expenditure financing parameters set out in the CPS 2012\u20132015, (ii) the taxes and duties apply only to \nADB-financed expenditures and (iii) the financing of the taxes and duties is relevant to the project's success. The \ngovernment will finance taxes and duties for consulting services, subproject studies and design and safeguard and \ncommunity participation through cash contribution in the amount of $0.7 million. \n11 ADB will also finance bank charges, transportation, and insurance costs.  \n ", "    5 \n15.  In the communes, the project will continue to coordinate with the local administrations, \nusing  the  commune  people's  committees  as  points  of  liaison.  The  PPMUs  will  work  with \ncommune personnel who will ensure coordination of day-to-day activities between the project \nand commune authorities. These activities will include organizing public consultations, and \ndesign  and  implementation  monitoring  by  commune  supervision  boards.12 The  boards  are \nsupported by regular budget allocations from the districts. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements for Additional Financing \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2015\u2013December 2018 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2018 \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency  Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development \n(ii)  Key implementing  Six provincial people\u2019s committees and project management units of \nagencies  participating provinces (Binh Dinh, Binh Thuan, Ha Tinh,  Ninh Thuan, Phu Yen, \nand Thua Thien\u2013Hue) \n(iii)  Implementation units  Existing central project management unit located in Ha Noi and existing \nprovincial project management units located in the participating provinces \nProcurement  National competitive bidding  31\u201340 contracts  $61.50 million \nShopping  1 contract  $0.04 million \nConsulting Services  Single-source selection for  1 contract 28 person-months  $1.60 million \nexisting loan implementation  for international and  \nconsultant  174 person-months for \nnational consultants \nLeast-cost selection for  1 contract  $0.17 million \nproject audit \nFixed-budget selection for  2 contracts  $0.60 million \nbaseline and endline surveys \nand subproject completion \naudit \nAdvanced contracting  No advanced contracting required for Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing. \nSubproject design consultants will be recruited and contracted by the provincial \nproject  management  units  using  their  counterpart  funds  prior  to  loan \neffectiveness. \nDisbursement  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development estimates. \n \n16.  The contract packaging reflects key lessons from the initial project on how to improve \nprocurement  and  consultant  recruitment.  Based  on  a  review  of  75  bid  evaluation  reports \nprepared by the PPMUs of six participating provinces, several measures  were adopted to \nimprove the quality and speed of civil works procurement. First, a single-stage, one-envelope \nbidding procedure will serve as the default to maximize transparency and price competition (as \nopposed to the single-stage, two-envelope procedure, which was the default under the initial \nproject).  Second,  any  requests  for  direct  contracting  during  implementation  will  be  strictly \nscrutinized  (almost  12%  of  civil  works  procurement  under  the  initial  project  used  direct \ncontracting). Third, to address the elevated risk of bidder collusion, civil works packages are \nconsolidated to increase minimum lot size to approximately $1 million thereby enhancing their \ncommercial  attractiveness.  To  generate  bidder  interest,  business  outreach  events  will  be \norganized  in  Da  Nang,  Lam  Dong  and  Quang  Tri.  Fourth,  prior  review  of  procurement \ndocuments prepared by Ha Tinh and Thua Thien\u2013Hue PPMUs will be undertaken given the \n                                                \n12 At least 30% of participants of commune supervision boards are women. \n ", "6   \ndeficiencies identified in their bid evaluation process. Fifth, having identified certain weaknesses \nin the bid evaluation reports of the PPMUs from six participating provinces, a customized \ntraining program will be developed to address deficiencies and  increase awareness of the \nadditional explanations provided in the national competitive bidding section of the procurement \nplan. Detailed description of these measures and the underlying procurement risks they address \nare set forth in the project administration manual (PAM).13  \n \n17.  Under the initial project, one package for recruiting a loan implementation consultant \nused quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) and prior review; the recruitment process had \nsevere  delays.  The  remaining  283  consulting  packages  were  recruited  using  consultant's \nqualifications selection and post review. To streamline and expedite consultant recruitment, a \nnew approach will be adopted. Consultant recruitment to be conducted by the PPMUs for \nfeasibility studies, detailed design, and construction supervision will be funded by government \ncounterpart funds following national procedures. Given the large number of packages and the \nPPMUs' limited knowledge of ADB procedures and the English language, the use of counterpart \nfunding will help minimize recruitment delays. Only four sets of consultants will be recruited. \nSelection methods that are more competitive than consultant\u2019s qualifications selection will be \nused, except as described in para. 18. \n \n18.  Single-source selection of the loan implementation consultant under the initial project, \nVICA  Consultants  International,  is  justified  for  several  reasons.  First,  VICA's  technical \ncapabilities  are  well  aligned  with  the  requirements  of  the  terms  of  reference  and  it  has \nexperience of exceptional value for this assignment. Also, VICA's actual performance under the \ninitial project was satisfactory. Second, VICA's financial proposal under the new contract will be \nreasonable because 23 of 28 person-months of international expert input  and 132 of 174 \nperson-months of national expert input will be provided by experts recruited under the original \nVICA  contract  based  on  remuneration  rates  determined  competitively  during  the  QCBS \nselection process. Third, given the specialized nature of the terms of reference, competition will \nbe limited; conducting a new selection process is unlikely to produce a firm with more technical \nexpertise or significantly lower price. Fourth, VICA's recruitment through single-source selection \nwill  significantly  accelerate  implementation  by  allowing  it  to  immediately  commence  key \nactivities involving review and/or preparation of technical design and safeguard documents, and \nsubproject investment reports. Fifth, recruitment of VICA will ensure continuity and eliminate \nlearning costs that will be incurred if a new consultant is recruited. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n19.  The audit reports for the completed subprojects indicate no major technical issues. Most \nrepresentatives of the end-users interviewed by the last review mission were satisfied with the \ncompleted works that were handed over to them. Technical capacity of the PPMU staff was \nstrengthened through the training provided. Subprojects to be undertaken under the additional \nfinancing  will  be  similar  to  those  under  the  initial  project  and  are  straightforward  rural \ninfrastructure  investments  (such  as  rehabilitating  and/or  upgrading  medium-scale  irrigation \ninfrastructure) at a scale within the technical implementation capacity of provincial agencies. \nThe  existing  loan  implementation  consultants  will  confirm  the  quality  of  design  for  each \nsubproject identification report (SIR), while increased ceilings for a subproject introduced as part \n                                                \n13 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "    7 \nof  the  subproject  selection  criteria  are  likely  to  minimize  the  frequent  design  changes \nexperienced under the original project.14 \n \n20.  To support increased productivity and diversification, each subproject can include an \nagricultural training proposal as part of the SIR, and the requested training budget will be \nevaluated based on the following criteria: (i) potential increase in overall annual production and \nsales, (ii) likely increase in yields, and (iii) likely crop diversification. The PPMUs will assign the \nprovincial agriculture extension centers the responsibility to deliver the training-related activities. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  Direct benefits from improved PRI improvements are more agricultural productivity along \nwith reductions in travel costs and times; indirect benefits include diversification of market-\noriented agriculture output, value-added production, and reduced risk of floods and drought \nresulting in avoided agricultural production loss. Indirect benefits are becoming increasingly \nimportant.  Completed  subproject  areas  seem  to  indicate  that  farm  households  with  small \nlandholdings can no longer advance their living standards by making incremental productivity \ngains in rice; such households are increasingly reliant on nonrice crops with improved irrigation \nsystems. As part of the preparation for the additional financing, one SIR was prepared for the \nupgrading of the Saloun reservoir and irrigation system subproject in Binh Thuan Province as a \nsample subproject. The estimated EIRR for this subproject is 15.3%. The subproject will enable \npoor  ethnic  minority  households  to  increase  their  income  and  improve  their  livelihood  by \ndiversifying  agriculture  production,  and  increase  their  access  to  public  services.15 Similar \npositive effects are expected from the implementation of the candidate subprojects. \n \n22.  Provincial government contributions during the additional financing period are expected \nto be in the range of 0.4%\u20132.0% per annum per province. 16 Therefore, the contributions are \naffordable. 17 All six provincial governments are committed to funding O&M under the same \nterms as for the original project. The six participating provinces have provided sufficient O&M for \nthe completed subprojects according to the amount specified in the SIRs. Therefore, risk of \ninadequate O&M funding under the additional financing is not likely. Implementation of O&M for \nthe completed subprojects will be monitored during the additional financing period. \n  \nC.  Governance \n23.  Procurement and recruitment activities under the original project were vulnerable to \nsignificant  risks  such  as  lack  of  competition,  collusion,  and  defective  bid  evaluation.  The \nproposed additional financing incorporates lessons from the completed subprojects to minimize \nsuch risks by (i) introducing the single-stage, one-envelope bidding procedure to maximize \ntransparency; (ii) consolidating civil works contracts to enhance commercial attractiveness for \nbidders;  (iii)  requiring  prior  review  for  PPMUs  that  showed  relatively  weak  bid  evaluation \n                                                \n14 The subproject ceiling under the ongoing project was from $0.5 million to $5 million. The subproject ceiling under \nthe additional financing is revised from greater than $2 million to less than $7 million. \n15 The Dong Gian commune is receiving support from national programs: (i) Prime Ministerial Decision 54/2012/QD-\nTTg (4 December 2012) \u201cpromulgating the Policy on loans for development of production with respect to especially \ndifficult ethnic minority households for the period from 2012 to 2015\u201d, and (ii) Decision 551/QD-TTg of 4 April 2013 \n\u201cOn approving the Program 135 on supporting the infrastructure investment and production development for \nspecially difficult communes, border communes, safety zone communes and specially difficult villages.\u201d The \nadditional financing will provide complementary training to ensure that the beneficiary farmers will be equipped with \nnecessary skills and knowledge for agriculture diversification. \n16 Provincial  government  contributions  to  the  project  will  mainly  comprise  project  investigation  and  design, \nconstruction supervision, and O&M after completion. \n17 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8   \nprocesses for the completed subprojects; and (iv) customizing procurement training by ADB\u2019s \nViet Nam Resident Mission. These measures are deemed adequate to address procurement \nrisks. \n24.  The original project was implemented without any major financial management issues. \nFinancial audits conducted in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 did not identify any major \nissues but indicated some weak financial management capacity of the PPMUs in Binh Dinh, \nBinh Thuan,  and Ninh Thuan provinces. The three PPMUs agreed to assign additional staff to \nensure that their financial  management  units  comprise  at  least  one  chief  accountant,  one \naccountant, and one cashier to strengthen their internal control of financial management. The \nCPMU agreed to provide financial management training to all participating PPMUs prior to \napproval of the additional financing by the ADB Board of Directors.  \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MARD. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 13). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n26.  In 2012, poverty in the participating provinces18 ranged from 6.1% to 15.7%, compared \nwith an overall national rate of 9.6% and an average for the central region of 13.4%. The \nadditional financing aims to strike a balance between the implementing capacity of a province \nand benefits for the poor in selecting the participating provinces. The preliminary data indicate \nthat the original project provided the beneficiaries, including women in the target communities, \nwith improved infrastructure that enabled increased productivity and diversification, increased \nincomes and empowerment through off-farm income-earning opportunities, reduced the burden \nof domestic household work, and increased participation in project decision-making. The project \nalso improved access to education, health, and social services. These benefits are expected to \naccrue to the beneficiaries of the additional financing subprojects. \n \n27.  Implementation  progress  reports  indicate  that  gender  targets  for  participation  in \nmeetings and trainings related to resettlement issues, technical O&M, and sanitation and water \nsavings were generally met. About 20%\u201340% of the commune supervision board members are \nwomen. Women\u2019s participation in O&M, however, was not feasible as the project did not finance \nthe improvement of tertiary canals. The implementation experiences also indicate the need to \nset appropriate numerical targets according to the availability of female staff in the PPMUs and \ntraining subjects. The gender classification for the additional financing scope is effective gender \nmainstreaming. Based on the lessons, a gender action plan was prepared and some of the \ngender action plan target indicators modified to ensure women\u2019s equal and feasible participation \nin decision-making and training opportunities.19 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  Environment (category B). The environmental assessment and review framework and \nprocedures developed under the initial project have been followed to date and have proved \nworkable. No major environmental impacts have been recorded since most of the works entail \nrehabilitating and upgrading existing infrastructure and are small to medium scale. Similar minor \nand  temporal  impacts  are  expected  for  the  additional  financing  scope.  A  draft  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE), prepared for the sample subproject (upgrading of the Saloun \nreservoir), concludes that potential environmental impacts are minor and temporary, and the \n                                                \n18 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2)  \n19 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "    9 \nproposed mitigation measures will minimize such impacts. If ADB assesses the quality of the \nfirst IEE to be satisfactory, then only subsequent subprojects estimated to cost $3.0 million or \nmore  will  be  required  to  forward  an  IEE  to  ADB  for  prior  review.  ADB  will  conduct  a \npostevaluation of IEEs for projects estimated to cost less than $3.0 million. The environmental \nassessment and review framework was updated for the additional financing to describe the \ndetailed implementation procedures and be in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement \n(2009).20 \n29.  Resettlement (category B). The resettlement framework prepared under the original \nproject was followed during project implementation. Forty-five of the 129 subprojects had minor \nland acquisition requirements. Most affected households only lost a marginal portion of their \nland and benefitted directly from the upgraded facilities. Independent monitoring was conducted \nfor  14  resettlement  activities  during  2011\u20132013,  and  confirmed  that  compensation  and \nallowances provided to affected households followed the approved framework and resettlement \nplans.  Additional  support  for  severely  affected  and  vulnerable  households  was  provided. \nRequirements  related  to  information  disclosure,  consultation,  and  grievance  redress  were \ngenerally followed. A postevaluation assessment of the resettlement assistance was conducted \nin  seven  provinces  to  assess  impacts  and  identify  lessons  from  implementation  of  the \nresettlement plans. Postevaluation in the remaining six provinces is ongoing. \n30.  For the additional financing, the PPMUs conducted initial screenings of the 24 proposed \ncandidate subprojects and noted that 8 subprojects are expected to involve minor permanent \nland acquisition impacts. The resettlement framework under the original project was updated \nand renamed the resettlement and ethnic minority development framework to reflect provisions \nunder ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and government policies on resettlement and ethnic \nminorities. A draft resettlement and ethnic minority development plan (REMDP) was prepared \nfor the sample subproject (upgrading of the Saloun reservoir). REMDPs will be prepared and \nimplemented for any of the remaining subprojects with impacts on land acquisition, resettlement, \nand  ethnic  minorities.  A  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  for  subprojects  with  only  land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts. The provincial people\u2019s committees, the PPMUs, and \ndistrict governments are committed to mobilize adequate staff and to follow the provisions in the \nupdated framework. \n31.  Indigenous  Peoples (category B). The resettlement framework approved under the \noriginal project includes an ethnic minority specific action. Ethnic minority considerations and \nmeasures were implemented for the completed subprojects. Initial screening of the candidate \nsubprojects shows that ethnic minority concerns may be relevant for four subprojects, including \nthe pilot subproject. No change will be made to the ethnic minorities farming and livelihood \nsystem or their cultural practices and ancestral domains. The draft REMDP prepared for the \npilot subproject attempts to provide additional measures to address the specific needs of the \naffected ethnic minority households and other farm households belonging to ethnic minority \ngroups  in  the  subproject  area.21 Impacts  on  ethnic  minorities  in  the  subproject  areas  are \nexpected to be overwhelmingly positive, as the subprojects will be aimed at overall economic \nand  social  improvement  of  the  total  population.  The  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment  framework  will  ensure  adequate  measures  to  address  the  specific  needs  of \naffected ethnic minority households and other farm households belonging to ethnic minority \ngroups in the subproject area.22 \n                                                \n20 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Combined Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Combined  Resettlement  and  Indigenous  Peoples  Planning  Framework  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures summarized in Table 4 are described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.23 With the proposed mitigation measures, the \noverall risk rating is low.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n33.  The government and MARD have assured ADB that implementation of the additional \nfinancing for the project shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n34.
