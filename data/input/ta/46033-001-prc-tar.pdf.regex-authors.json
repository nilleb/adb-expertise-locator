INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the annual country programming mission in December 2011, the Government of \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \npolicy  and  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  a  study  to  support  highway  safety  and \ninformation system development. A fact-finding mission visited Beijing in September 2012 and \nreached  agreement  with  Integrated  Planning  Division  of  the  Comprehensive  Planning \nDepartment  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangement, and terms of reference for consulting services. The \nTA is in ADB\u2019s TA program for the PRC for 2012.1 The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  After 3 decades of sustained investment, the PRC\u2019s national trunk highway system \n(NTHS) network is now the second-longest in the world.3 Further NTHS improvements are \nenvisaged as part of the PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015. The overall aim is to \ncomplete an NTHS network suitable for meeting the needs of the entire population of the PRC \nby  2020.  This  is  expected  to  be  over  100,000  kilometers  (km)  in  length.  However,  rising \nincomes have led to rapid increases in motorization and traffic levels, which have contributed to \ngrowing problems of congestion, road accidents, and vehicle emissions. These have become \ncritical issues for NTHS management in the PRC. \n \n3.  Intelligent transport systems (ITS) have the potential to improve the efficiency and safety \nof road use and to ease traffic congestion.4 The three core elements of an ITS are detection, \nprocessing, and dissemination of information on traffic condition and incidents. The PRC has \nbeen deploying ITS on many highways, where they typically account for 1.0%\u20131.5% of highway \nconstruction cost. This has mainly relied on conventional fixed-network-based ITS, which uses \ndevices  installed  at  fixed  locations.  Recent  advances  in  mobile  (wireless)  communication \ntechnology, combined with high levels of usage of mobile devices, now provide the platform for \na paradigm shift from fixed-network-based ITS to mobile-network-based ITS utilizing connected \nvehicle technology including both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)5 and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)6 \napproaches. Compared with a fixed-network-based ITS, connected vehicle technology provides \nan  effective  and  cost-efficient  way  of  performing  the  three  elements  of  ITS  in a  real-time \nenvironment by providing information individually to each driver through dedicated onboard \nequipment. It can support ITS applications for improving safety, mobility, and environmental \nperformance in the following ways: \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2011\u20132015. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 September 2012. \n3  The total length of the PRC NTHS network comprised 85,000 kilometers (km) at the end of 2011. The United \nStates interstate highway network has a total length of 92,000 km. \n4  ITS are advanced applications that aim to provide innovative services relating to different modes of transport and \ntraffic management and enable users to be better informed and make safer, more coordinated, and \u201csmarter\u201d use \nof transport networks. \n5  V2V communication systems are an emerging type of networks in which vehicles act as the communicating nodes; \nproviding each other with information, such as safety warnings and traffic information. As a cooperative approach, \nsuch systems can be more effective in avoiding accidents and traffic congestion than if each vehicle tries to solve \nthese problems individually. \n6  V2I communication is the wireless exchange of critical safety and operational data between vehicles and roadway \ninfrastructure, intended primarily to avoid motor vehicle crashes and congestion. \n ", "2  \n(i)  Safety applications have potential to reduce crashes through providing advisory \ninformation and warnings. For instance, vehicle operators may be advised of a \nschool zone, sharp ramp curve, or slippery patch of roadway ahead. \n(ii)  Mobility applications can create a connected, data-rich travel environment based \non  information  transmitted  anonymously  from  thousands  of  vehicles  that  are \nusing  the  transport  system  at  a  particular  time,  which  can  help  transport \nmanagers to monitor and manage transport system performance. \n(iii)  Environment applications can provide travelers with real-time information about \ntraffic congestion and other travel conditions to help them to make more informed \ndecisions that may result in their taking alternate routes or public transit. This can \nhelp make their trip more fuel-efficient and eco-friendly. \n \n4.  Road accidents, congestion, and vehicle emissions have become urgent problems that \nneed to be addressed on the PRC\u2019s NTHS. From 1995 to 2010, the number of deaths from \naccidents on the NTHS increased tenfold from 616 persons to 6,300 persons, growing at an \naverage annual rate of 17.9%. NTHS vehicle-kilometers driven accounted for only 1.9% of \nhighway vehicle-kilometer driven in 2010, but NTHS deaths made up 13.5% of highway traffic \ndeaths. The average annual accident fatality rate7 for the NTHS was 27.8% during 1995\u20132010, \nwhich was 1.3 times higher than the accident fatality rate for highway traffic accidents.8 \n \n5.  Road congestion has become a major issue in the PRC, especially near cities, where \ncongestion levels are highest. The costs of congestion include lost time and higher transport \ncosts. While detailed congestion cost studies are not yet available for the PRC, in other ADB \ndeveloping member countries the annual cost of congestion often amounts to 2%\u20135% of gross \ndomestic product.9 \n \n6.  Tailpipe emissions from vehicles are the single largest human-made source of carbon \ndioxide (CO ), nitrous oxides, and methane. Vehicles that are stationary, idling, and traveling in \n2\na stop\u2013go pattern due to congestion emit more than those traveling in free-flow conditions. With \nexpected rapid growth in CO  emissions in the PRC and other large developing countries, global \n2\nCO  emissions from transport are projected to increase nearly 50% by 2030. This will have \n2\nprofound  environmental,  economic,  and  social  consequences\u2015both  in  the  PRC  and \nglobally\u2015unless the means can be introduced for containing this growth in emissions. \n \n7.  Mobile-network-based ITS offers a major opportunity for introducing new technologies \nthat can augment efforts to address these problems. For the prevention of traffic accidents, this \nform of ITS can reduce the risk of crashes by providing drivers with warnings when dangerous \nsituations  arise.  For  congestion  management,  the  use  of  V2I,  together  with  the  use  of \nanonymous  information  from  passengers\u2019  wireless  devices  relayed  through  wireless \ntransmission media, can dramatically improve the quality and quantity of real-time information \non traffic conditions that is available to transport agencies, making it easier for them to manage \ntransport systems for maximum efficiency and minimum congestion. V2V and V2I technologies \ncan also enable travelers to avoid traffic jams by changing their route, time, and mode of travel, \nbased on up-to-the-minute conditions. With reduced congestion, vehicles can operate at more \nefficient speeds that produce lower tailpipe emissions. By directly and individually receiving \n                                                 \n7  Accident deaths as a proportion of accident deaths plus accident injuries. \n8  J. Zhao and W.

Mobile-network-based ITS has the potential to replace or supplement existing and future \nITS development due to their effectiveness in terms of operation and cost, and the rapid \nproliferation of mobile-based communication infrastructure. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  The TA will support highway transport information development activities within the \ngovernment\u2019s strategic promotion of the Internet of Things10 in the 12th Five-Year Plan. \n \n10.  It will build upon a previous ADB TA for Improving Road Safety through the Application \nof Intelligent Transport Systems,11 which examined the general ITS architecture, focusing on \nfixed-network-based ITS. The proposed TA will support the development of a policy for mobile-\ncommunication-based ITS. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be the establishment of a mobile-communication-based ITS development \npolicy  for  improving  safety,  mobility,  and  environmental  sustainability  on  the  NTHS.  The \noutcome will be a development plan for connected vehicle (V2V and V2I) technologies for ITS \non the NTHS prepared on the basis of identified commercial and public sector perspectives and \nissues affecting connected vehicle development. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The main purpose of the TA is to provide support for establishing a policy for the \ndevelopment and implementation of a mobile-communication-based ITS, using V2V and V2I \nconnected vehicle technologies. The focus will be on the use of such technologies to improve \nsafety, mobility, and environmental sustainability on the NTHS. The TA will include (i) review of \nconnected vehicle research and development in advanced countries and the PRC, and related \ninternational  standards;  (ii)  evaluation  of  commercial  and  public  sector  perspectives  of \nconnected vehicle development in the PRC; (iii) review of issues affecting connected vehicle \ndevelopment in the PRC; (iv) capacity development for executing agency staff and other key \nstakeholders;  (v)  a  policy  note  on  developing  connected-vehicle-based  ITS  for  the  PRC \nhighways; and (vi) policy-oriented knowledge products and services on mobile-communication-\nbased ITS for DMCs. \n13.  The tasks of the TA consultant will include assisting the executing agency in the design, \nexecution, and evaluation of its technical testing program for the V2V and V2l technologies. The \nexecuting agency plans to perform this testing on a 10 km section of highway G4 of the NTHS \nlocated near Changsha City in Hunan Province. The section is equipped with five WiMax12 base \nstations and one China Mobile Multimedia Broadcasting station. As these communications \ninfrastructure  facilities  support  V2I  and  indirect  V2V  implementation,  the  test  needs  to  be \nconsidered as a part of the task of identifying technological issues for developing connected \nvehicle technology in the PRC. \n                                                 \n10  Refers to uniquely identifiable objects (things) and their virtual representatives in an internet-like structure. \n11  ADB. 2009.
