INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  In September 2010, representatives from 11 ministries of education of Pacific countries \nmet in Papua New Guinea and agreed to support a new learning assessment tool for use in \nearly primary education grades. The early grade learning assessment (EGLA), which includes \nboth early grade literacy assessment (EGRA) and early grade numeracy assessment, has been \ndecided upon as the preferred assessment tool. Education secretaries\u2019 meetings in 2011 further \ndiscussed the strategy on EGRA application in the Pacific region and agreed to roll out EGRA in \nthe  region,  utilizing  the  Tonga  model  as  a  successful  example.  The  Federated  States  of \nMicronesia (FSM), the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), and Palau requested that the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support  the  implementation  of  EGLA  in  their  respective \ncountries. This initiative will be the first project in Pacific developing member countries (DMCs) \nto  have  both  EGRA  and  early  grade  numeracy  assessment  aspects.  While  the  regional \ntechnical assistance (TA) was not included in the Pacific regional operations business plan \n(2010\u20132013),1 in  response  to the  countries' requests, the TA  concept  was  developed  and \napproved by the ADB vice-president (Operations 2) on 8 August 2011. The TA will contribute to \nimproved quality of primary school education, and EGLA outcomes in the three participating \ncountries  will  contribute  to  further  comparative  analyses  in  the  region.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Access to education and outcomes in the Pacific. Over the past 10 years, the United \nNations\u2019 Education for All3 campaign and the Millennium Development Goals have focused their \nattention on educational achievements. This attention has led to measurable success; Pacific \nDMCs have made significant progress towards universal access to primary education, with \naverage enrollment rates of more than 80%.4 However, in almost all Pacific DMCs student \nlearning outcomes still lag significantly behind improvements in access to schooling.5 Evidence \nfrom most Pacific DMCs6 that participate in international assessments, such as the Programme \nfor  International  Student  Assessment  (PISA),7 indicates  that  Pacific  students  are  greatly \nunderrepresented  in  the  high-achieving  groups  in  literacy  and  mathematics  assessments.8 \nNearly one-third of students in Pacific DMCs  were at the lowest proficiency level in the PISA \nmeasures in 2007, compared with only 9% of European students were at that level. Similarly, for \nmathematics, nearly one-third of students in Pacific DMCs performed at the lowest levels in the \nPISA assessment (footnote 7).  \n \n3.  Challenges  in  measuring  learning  outcomes.  Difficulties  with  learning  in  many \nschools often begin during the first year of schooling. Failure of children to acquire basic skills in \n                                                \n1   ADB. 2010. Pacific Regional Operations Business Plan: 2010\u20132013. Manila. \n2   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 20 March 2012. \n3   The campaign was launched during the World Conference on Education for All in 1990, and was supported during \nthe World Education Forum in 2000. The forum has confirmed the United Nations Educational, Scientific and \nCultural Organization (UNESCO) as the lead organization to implement the campaign. Education for All is being \nsupported widely by both multilateral and bilateral development agencies.  \n4   ADB. 2011.

Washington, D.C. \n ", "2   \nliteracy and numeracy in the early grades leads to increased grade repetition and dropouts, and \nultimately reduced opportunities and lower social skills. Yet, few developing countries, including \nPacific  DMCs,  give  priority  to  measuring  how  well  children  are  acquiring  reading  and \nmathematics skills in the early grades.9 Many countries develop national assessments in an \nattempt to measure learning outcomes against nationally defined standards,10 but nearly all \nnational and international assessments are paper-and-pencil tests administered to students in \ngrade 3 and above. In the RMI, the Ministry of Education (MOE) began using the Marshall \nIslands Standardized Achievement Test. However, this test is only intended to measure the \nlearning outcomes against students above grade 3. Because these tests assume that students \ncan read and write, it is not always possible to distinguish between students who score poorly \nbecause they lack the knowledge tested by the assessments or because they lack basic reading \nand comprehension skills.11   \n \n4.  Progress in student performance assessment systems in the Pacific. Countries in \nthe Pacific region have made some advances in terms of systematic assessment of student \nperformance, although more progress is needed. Most Pacific DMCs have conducted at least \none national student assessment since 2000, but the scientific reliability and validity of these \nassessments reportedly varies greatly (footnote 8). The MOE in most Pacific DMCs lacks the \nexperience  and  expertise  to  carry  out  rigorous  assessments  of  learning  outcomes.  In \nSeptember 2010, during the meeting of education ministers, it was agreed that a new learning \nassessment tool  for  early  grades  in  primary  education  would  be  supported.  Three  Pacific \ncountries have already begun implementing EGRA in partnership with the World Bank, while \nseveral others considered starting pilot EGLA in 2011. EGLA is a simplified assessment tool \nthat could report on the foundation levels of student learning, including an assessment of the \nfirst steps students take in learning to read, recognizing letters of the alphabet, reading simple \nwords, and understanding simple mathematics.  \n \n5.  In Tonga, EGRA is included as part of the primary school curriculum, and learning \nmaterials and teaching strategies are tailored according to each student\u2019s learning achievement. \nBased on the successful outcomes of the Tongan EGRA, many Pacific DMCs have expressed \ninterest in replicating EGLA in their countries.     \n \n6.  The TA will support the FSM, Palau, and the RMI to initiate EGLA at grades 2 and 5 of \nselected primary schools. The objective is to help the participating countries begin the process \nof systematically measuring how well children in the early grades of primary are acquiring \nreading  and  mathematics  skills,  and  ultimately  spur  more  effective  efforts  to  improve \nperformance in these core learning areas. The TA will use Tonga's integrated approach to pilot \nEGLA in the FSM, Palau, and the RMI.  \n \n7.  To strengthen the link between learning assessment and learning methods, the TA will \nalso support improved teaching techniques and learning approaches in reading and numeracy, \nadopting  a  methodology  of  individualized  learning  and  assessment  based  on  repetition, \naccuracy, and speed.12 The key to individualized instruction is to study at the \u201cjust right\u201d level. \nThe starting point for each student will be determined individually in coordination with EGLA.  \n                                                \n9    Early grade literacy assessment meeting. April 2011. The World Bank. Sydney. \n10   UNESCO. 2007. http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=30873&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC& \nURL_SECTION=201.html \n11   RTI International. 2008. EGRA: Frequently Asked Questions. http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADL848.pdf \n12  Kumon, E.nopi and Sylvan are examples of individualized learning and assessment methodology. These are \nreading and mathematical educational methods, advocating several values of learning that include speed, \naccuracy, and mastery of material before a student is able to move on to the next lesson. With these methods, \nstudents do not work together as a class but advance through the assessment at their own pace, moving on to the \n ", "  3 \n8.  Every student has diverse learning curves and different learning styles. In addition, \nstudents acquire new knowledge at different rates and also come from different socio-economic \nbackgrounds.  One  standardized  education  program  will  therefore  not  work  equally  for  all \nstudents. The individualized learning approach provides students the opportunity to learn at \ntheir own pace through a custom made program that meets their special learning curves and \nallows  them  to  reach their greatest  potential.  This  approach  has  a  proven  track-record to \nimprove the overall leaning outcomes of education in many countries.13 \n  \n9.  The TA will be funded by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR). ADB will work \nclosely  with  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  volunteers  who already  have \nsignificant experience in managing various education projects in the three target countries as a \nresult of their role as school teachers in the three countries. The TA\u2019s objective of improved \naccess to quality education is in line with the priority areas identified in ADB\u2019s Strategy 202014 \nand ADB\u2019s education operations plan.15 To the extent possible, the EGLA core strategy will be \naligned with other development partners16 who are supporting EGLA elsewhere in the region. \nThis  will  promote further  regional  consistency  and  efforts  to  monitor  learning  outcomes  in \nprimary education.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact will be improved access to quality education for primary school students in \nFSM, Palau, and RMI. The outcome will be that participating governments integrate EGLA in \nnine  schools  for  grades  2  and  5  and  develop  individualized  learning  and  assessment \napproaches.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will achieve the following four outputs with key activities: \n \n12.  Output 1: Pilot early grade learning assessment in nine schools. The TA will assist \nFSM,17 Palau, and RMI to pilot EGLA at grades 2 and 5 in three primary schools in each country. \nUnder the TA, EGLA materials will be developed; training for trainers will be provided; and \nworkshops to introduce EGLA to MOEs, communities, and schools will be conducted. EGLA \nbaseline survey and data analysis will be supported. Community participation will be promoted \nthrough regular EGLA school meetings with communities.  \n \n13.  Output 2: Develop individualized learning approaches. The TA will support each of \nthree participating countries to develop an individualized learning approach to literacy and \n                                                                                                                                                       \nnext level only when they have mastered the previous level. These approaches have been successfully trialed \nin more  than  46  countries.  Individualized  learning  and  assessment  methodology  providers  have  existing \noperations in the Pacific region through their operation centers in Australia and New Zealand.  \n13   J.

Learning methods and teaching materials will be procured and a special learning \ncenter  established  in  each  country  during  the  TA  period  to  apply  and  administer  the \nindividualized learning approach. Training for learning center staff will be provided on monitoring \nEGLA outcomes and administering the individualized learning approach.  \n \n14.  Output  3:  Integrate  early  grade  learning  assessment  with  the  education \nmanagement  information  system.  Under  the  TA,  the  quality  of  the  existing  education \nmanagement information system (EMIS) will be assessed and a feasibility analysis for the \nintegration of EGLA with the EMIS carried out. EMIS training for trainers, school teachers, and \nMOEs will be provided to improve the EMIS quality with EGLA data. To improve the EMIS, \nnecessary information and communication technology equipment will be procured under the TA. \n \n15.  Output  4:  Early  grade  learning  assessment  data  regional  comparison  and \nreplication nationwide. The TA will assist participating governments to develop a publication \non  EGLA,  and  the  Asia  South  Pacific  Board  for  Education  Assessment  to  conduct  a \ncomparative impact analyses on the EGLA pilot within the countries18 and with other regions. A \nregional workshop will be organized to disseminate the EGLA outcome. The documentation and \nworkshop will recommend approaches to  scale up EGLA nationwide in the three selected \ncountries if the results of the impact evaluations are satisfactory.  \n \n16.  Major assumptions and risks. Major assumptions of the TA are that the governments \nof the three countries are committed to improving the quality of primary education, and fully \nunderstand  the  added  value  of  EGLA  and  individualized  learning  approaches.  It  is  also \nassumed that the implementing units of the MOEs are able to release staff and enumerators \nand/or supervisors during the TA implementation, in particular during the baseline survey. In \naddition, it is assumed that the capacity of schools is considered to be adequate to use EGLA \non a regular basis, and target schools will work closely with special learning centers introduced \nby the TA to establish good links between learning assessment and development of materials. \n \n17.  Potential  risks  for  the  TA  are  that  there  will  be  a  high  turnover  of  teachers  from \ndesignated schools, or development partners may introduce a new learning assessment tool \nwithout coordination with EGLA. JICA volunteers will work closely with the schools to ensure the \nintegration of EGLA, and ADB together with JICA volunteers will ensure the introduction of new \ntools is coordinated among development partners. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $1,650,000 equivalent. The governments of FSM, \nPalau, and RMI have requested ADB to finance $1,350,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by the JFPR, and administered by ADB. The three participating governments \nwill provide in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  of  the  TA,  responsible  for  all  recruitment  of \nconsultants and procurement in consultation with the host governments. The MOEs of the FSM, \nPalau, and the RMI will be the implementing agencies. Each MOE will identify a responsible \nofficer  for  coordination  of  the  outputs  with  consultants.  Training  and  workshops  will  be \nimplemented and administered by the consultants. Implementing units of the MOEs will work \n                                                \n18  In the comparative impact study, nonpilot schools will be selected as a control group. \n ", "  5 \nwith existing volunteers from the JICA at primary schools to coordinate and monitor outputs 1\u20133 \nin each country. \n \n20.  The  proceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will require \na total of 66 person-months of consultant services (42 person-months of international and 24 \nperson-months of national) as follows: (i) team leader, 12 person-months, (ii) EGLA experts in \nliteracy  and  numeracy,  10  person-months;  (iii)  education  data  management  experts,                    \n10 person-months; (iv) education quality specialist, 10 person-months; (v) education statistics \nand data management specialist, 6 person-months; and (vi) pool of consultants, 18 person-\nmonths. The consultants will be engaged individually by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Procurement will follow ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Some of the consultants will \nwork on an intermittent basis or will be recruited later, responding to government requirements \nand progress made during implementation. The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from       \n1 May 2012 to 30 April 2014. Outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.
