During  discussions  for  the  country  operations  business  plan  2008\u20132010 1  the \nGovernment of India requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to enhance the capacity of power sector entities in the state of Bihar. ADB conducted a \nfact-finding mission from 3 to 14 December 2007 and reached an understanding with the Bihar \nstate  government  (BSG)  on  the  TA\u2019s  objective,  scope,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan, \nimplementing arrangements, and consultants\u2019 terms of reference. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.2   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Demand for electricity in Bihar is expected to grow rapidly as the generation network is \nrehabilitated and as suppressed demand is released. Years of neglect and lack of generation \nsources has driven many electricity consumers out of the state or to alternative energy sources \nincluding captive generation. Most of these consumers are likely to reappear once BSG can \ndemonstrate that electricity is reliable and affordable. Rural electrification is also expected to \nsignificantly increase electricity consumption, and existing customers of Bihar State Electricity \nBoard (BSEB) will naturally increase their electricity drawn from the grid by simple virtue of the \nincrease in the number of hours for which they receive supply from the grid. This demand \ngrowth will increase load density in some areas meaning that new supply solutions will need to \nbe investigated. It will also result in a wider geographic supply base with very low load density in \nsome areas, which requires a different set of supply solutions to those currently adopted. \n \n3.  Uncertainty surrounds future sources of electricity for Bihar. The state has significant \nhydropower potential, but the risk inherent in hydropower development and the long lead times \nsuggest that hydropower may not be a significant power generating source for Bihar within the \nnext 10\u201315 years. In the meantime, new in-state thermal plants and electricity purchased from \noutside Bihar will be the main power sources. The need to develop a planning framework within \nwhich various generation scenarios can be developed is essential if the transmission grid is to \nbe capable of efficiently supplying all in-state and out-of-state consumers with an appropriately \nreliable supply. \n \n4.  Despite the clear need, no coherent plan is in place for development of the power \nsystem in Bihar, and BSEB does not have long-term planning capability. No meaningful regional \nlong-term demand forecasting is evident, and the concept of staged development of the power \nsystem to meet horizon year demand is not understood. In the absence of a planning framework, \ncapacity additions are made in an ad hoc manner in response to the availability of funding.   \n \n5.  Considering the wide range of possible supply and demand scenarios that may develop \nin Bihar, the preparation of a comprehensive power system master plan is essential. The master \nplan would be linked to a sector policy and include a clear planning framework, planning criteria, \nand a detailed and disaggregated demand forecast at the power substation (33/11 kilovolt) level. \nIt  would  provide  a  series  of  staged,  least-cost,  10\u201315  year  network  expansion  programs \nmatched to demand growth and various generation scenarios. A rolling 5-year capital works \nplan linked to the master plan also needs to be developed and regularly updated with detailed \nproject reports prepared for projects covered in the first 1\u20132 years of the capital works plan.

ADB's  TA  will  assist BSG  in  developing the  power  system  master  plan,  which  will \naddress long existing planning issues of Bihar's power sector.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The outcome of the TA will be a comprehensive power system master plan to provide \nthe blueprint for development of the power system in Bihar. The master plan will coordinate \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution expansion to ensure with confidence that all proposed \ncapital investments are not ad hoc and are instead part of a long-term, structured plan. It will \nensure that network expansion is economically efficient and will provide a realistic framework for \nloss reduction.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The expected outputs of the TA include \n \n(i)  a detailed long-term (10-year) demand forecast for Bihar at the power substation \nlevel, with demand disaggregated between main consumer groups; \n(ii)  a  series  of  realistic  long-term  generation  capacity  expansion  scenarios,  with \nconsideration given to prospects for in-state generation development as well as \ngeneration sourced from outside of Bihar; \n(iii)  a series of least-cost transmission expansion plans, matched to the generation \nexpansion scenarios developed; \n(iv)  an  assessment  of  the  amount  and  timing  of  generation  and  transmission \ninvestments for each system development scenario; \n(v)  an estimate of distribution investment costs to meet demand growth; \n(vi)  a program of distribution loss reduction initiatives; \n(vii)  a targeted loss reduction program, with an assessment of returns expected from \ninvestments in terms of technical and nontechnical loss reduction; \n(viii)  institutional reform recommendations for BSEB to develop capacity to implement \nand revise the power system master plan as necessary;  \n(ix)  a power system analysis software program and equipment (computers); and \n(x)  a  detailed  5-year  program  of  capital  works,  and  detailed  project  reports  for \nprojects to be covered in the first 2 years. \n \n9.
