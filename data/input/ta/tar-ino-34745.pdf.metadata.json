The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  supported  the  development  of  madrasah  \neducation in Indonesia since the early 1990s. During the 2003 Country Strategy and Program \nUpdate Mission, the Government of Indonesia confirmed its request to have ADB continue \nassistance to this sector by providing project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for the \ndevelopment of the Madrasah Education Development Project. The Fact-Finding Mission took \nplace  in  March  2004,  with  a  follow-up  mission  in  April  2004.  The  missions  reached \nunderstanding  with  the  Government  regarding  the  goals,  purpose,  outputs,  scope, \nimplementation arrangements, and costs and financing of the TA and the terms of reference for \nthe consultants.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The national education system includes public and private secular schools under the \nauspices of the Ministry of National Education (MONE) and public and private Islamic schools, \nor madrasah, managed and regulated by the Ministry of Religious Affairs (MORA). A new \neducation law (no. 20 of 2003) has established the basis for a national education system \ncovering all providers, which will be subject to standards set and enforced by MONE. Public \nMONE schools form by far the largest education subsystem and cater to 72.3% of students, \nfollowed  by  private  MONE  schools  with  14.7%,  private  madrasah  with  10.5%,  and  public \nmadrasah with 2.5%.   \n \n3.  Madrasah contribute significantly to the Government\u2019s efforts to achieve universal 9-year \nbasic education because they serve the poor, are inexpensive, and operate in rural and isolated \nareas that offer few other educational opportunities. National education statistics confirm their \nimportance. While the Government has made good progress in achieving high national gross \nparticipation rates in basic education, raising enrollment in rural areas and among hard-to-reach \ngroups has proven difficult. Having achieved 100% gross participation in primary education, \ncurrent Government policy focuses on increasing participation in junior secondary education \nfrom 81% to 95% by 2008. Gross enrollment rates for the 3-year senior secondary level are only \n41%. At both the junior and senior secondary levels, enrollments are much lower in rural areas. \nThe result, for rural areas in particular, is a highly pyramidal system. Nationally, only 46% of \nstudents entering Grade 1 graduate from basic education (primary and junior secondary) and \nonly 30% graduate from the next level (senior secondary). The resources of the madrasah \nsystem could be harnessed more effectively than at present in national efforts to expand access \nto basic and senior secondary education among girls, hard-to-reach groups, and in rural areas.  \n \n4.  Around 38,500 madrasah provide schooling to 5.7 million students. During the past \ndecade, enrollments have increased steadily at all levels. The most significant contribution of \nmadrasah to the national education system is at the junior secondary level, where they enroll \n21% of all students. More than 50% of madrasah students are girls and more than 50% are the \nchildren  of  farmers  or  laborers.  While  all  madrasah  were  originally  founded  by  nonprofit, \ncharitable foundations, some 10% have been converted to public ownership under MORA. \nMadrasah foundations range from local foundations running one madrasah, usually small and in \na remote area, to national foundations running more than 500 madrasah.   \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 28 October 2003 and was last updated \non 14 June 2004. \n ", " 2  \n5.   In 2001, MONE public and private schools were decentralized to the district level as part \nof the national decentralization of social services, but madrasah were left under the central \nauthority of MORA. However, following the Decentralization Law (no. 22 of 1999), MORA has \nbegun preparing for the decentralization of madrasah by drafting a Government regulation that \nwill regulate the decentralization of madrasah to districts on a voluntary basis.  \n \n6.  In preparation for the proposed Project, and as an input into a larger review of basic \neducation sponsored by the World Bank,2 in 2003 MORA commissioned a comprehensive \nmadrasah education sector assessment with support from the Government of Australia and \nADB.3  The  assessment  reviewed  the  quality  of  madrasah  education,  the  governance  and \nmanagement  of  madrasah,  and  the  financing  and  decentralization  of  madrasah  and \nrecommended reforms in each of these key areas. A key recommendation of the assessment \nwas that madrasah should be decentralized to districts in a phased manner like other social \nservices.  \n \n7.  Quality  of  Education.  To  support  the  integration  of  madrasah  into  the  national \neducation system, madrasah are now required to follow the national curriculum (with additional \ninstruction  in  Islam).  However,  the  quality  of  madrasah  education,  as  measured  by  pupil \nperformance on national examinations, continues to be low. The most significant cause of this \nlow performance is the poor quality of teaching. Many teachers work part-time and most are \nonly qualified to teach religious education. Other significant causes of low educational quality \nare a lack of textbooks and instructional materials and poor physical facilities.  \n \n8.  Governance and Management. New laws on decentralization, education financing, \nfinancial  management,  and  the  national  education  system  have  significantly  changed  the \nenvironment in which madrasah operate. The governance and management of madrasah must \nadapt to these new circumstances, which include participatory decision making through school \ncommittees, publicly accountable financial management systems, quality improvement plans, \nand related business plans.  \n \n9.  Financial Sustainability. The Government is trying to reduce the funding gap between \nthe public and private education sectors and between madrasah and other schools. Both public \nand private madrasah are less well funded than MONE public and private schools. National \nguidelines  are  needed  to  help  districts  allocate  funds  equitably  to  ensure  the  financial \nsustainability of private schools and madrasah after they have been decentralized. The use of \nblock grants and funding tied to performance agreements with madrasah will promote good \ngovernance.  Encouraging  the  establishment  of  endowment  funds  for  madrasah  would  be \nanother option for improving their financial sustainability. \n \n10.  Social and Gender Equity. As madrasah serve predominantly poor rural communities \nand girls, affirmative action is needed to ensure that these children are not disadvantaged. \nMadrasah could play an important role in increasing the access of rural children and girls to \nsecondary education, thereby helping the Government achieve the national goal of 9 years of \ncompulsory education. Scholarship programs, improved classrooms, and programs aimed at \nincreasing completion and transition rates are needed. Remedial programs are also needed to \nsupport  children  with  weak  education  backgrounds.  In  addition,  many  children  in  poor \ncommunities, both boys and girls, have little access to health care. School health clinics would \n                                                 \n2  World Bank. 2004. Education Sector Review.  Jakarta.  \n3  MORA. 2004. Madrasah Education Sector Assessment.  Jakarta. \n ", "    3\nhelp  identify  health  issues  among  students  and  promote  health  education.  Women  play \nimportant roles as madrasah teachers, but are less often employed as principals.  \n \n11.  Policy Issues. The Government\u2019s main policy thrust for madrasah is to integrate them \ninto the national education system and reduce the quality gap between MONE schools and \nmadrasah. To this end it is requiring madrasah to follow the national curriculum, have their \nstudents take national examinations, and adhere to national minimum learning standards once \nthey are approved. In addition, they will eventually have to participate in a unified accreditation \nsystem. The issue of decentralizing madrasah in line with the decentralization of other social \nservices  remains  controversial.  The  policy  MORA  is  proposing  accommodates  these \nreservations by making decentralization voluntary. The Project will support reform measures \nthat ADB has discussed with the Government in the areas of madrasah financing, governance, \nand teacher recruitment and training. The Government\u2019s strategy is in line with (i) ADB\u2019s policies \nto support poverty reduction and quality basic education for all by focusing on hard-to-reach \ngroups such as girls and low-income families in rural areas; and (ii) ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and \nProgram Update for Indonesia, which emphasizes that the madrasah system must be brought \nup to the standard of the mainstream education system. Indonesia\u2019s profile in relation to the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  for  education  shows  that  it  has  almost  achieved  universal \nprimary education and gender parity in primary and secondary education. Primary completion \nrates may reach 100% by 2015, as they have improved steadily over the last two decades.   \n \n12.  Lessons Learned. ADB has assisted madrasah education since the mid-1990s, mainly \nthrough  two  projects  aimed  at  improving  the  quality  and  management  of  public  madrasah \neducation and integrating it into the national education system.4  ADB has also assisted both \npublic and private madrasah through two other projects that followed a systemwide approach by \nstrengthening local education systems, of which madrasah are a part.5 These projects have laid \na good foundation for the improvement of madrasah education and will form the basis for the \nproposed  Project.  However,  their  experience  shows  that  more  fundamental  changes,  as \noutlined in para. 11, are necessary to achieve sustainable quality improvement. In designing the \npilot decentralization of madrasah, the Project will promote the integration of madrasah into the \ndistrict education system and follow a systemic approach to local education development.  \n \n13.  Lessons learned from earlier assistance illustrate the importance of (i) strong buy-in by \nall stakeholders in relation to any major reforms proposed for madrasah, (ii) close collaboration \nwith the private madrasah sector to ensure that strategies are acceptable and appropriate and \nare adapted to the sector\u2019s special characteristics, (iii) local ownership of reforms, and (iv) \nindependent monitoring and evaluation to strengthen the governance and accountability of \nproject management.  \n  \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1996.

THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n14.  The  objective  of  the  TA  is  to  design  a  project  for  the  development  of  madrasah \neducation. The overall goal of the proposed Project is to enhance the quality and national \ncoverage of 9 years of compulsory basic education. The purpose of the proposed project is to \npromote  closer  integration  of  public  and  private  madrasah  at  all  levels  into  the  national \neducation system, and improve the quality, equity, governance and management of madrasah. \n \n15.   The output of the TA will be a project design that will (i) improve the quality of education \nin  madrasah  through  better  teaching  and  learning  resources  and  better  trained  teachers, \nstrengthened selected madrasah so that they become model or \u201csmart\u201d schools, and enhanced \nquality  assurance  systems;  (ii)  improve  social  equity  by  providing  financial  and  academic \nsupport to disadvantaged children, extending access (especially to girls and to indigenous \ngroups if appropriate), and establishing madrasah health clinics; (iii) improve the management \nand financial sustainability of madrasah by reducing financing gaps between MONE public and \nprivate schools and madrasah, introducing block grants linked to performance agreements, \nreducing  inefficiencies  in  the  allocation  of  civil  service  teachers,  establishing  transparent \nfinancial  management  in  madrasah,  and  establishing  school  committees  in  madrasah;  (iv) \nfacilitate decentralization in selected districts by developing national and local policies and the \nlegal framework needed for decentralization, strengthening districts\u2019 organizational structures \nand capacity to govern and manage the madrasah system, and decentralizing the information \nmanagement system; and (v) assess and address the impact of decentralization on MORA\u2019s \nstructures and functions. The proposed project framework is in Appendix 1 and the initial \npoverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2.  \n \n16.  The proposed Project will consist of a project loan and piggybacked advisory TA for \nindependent monitoring and evaluation of the Project. The Project will focus on the long-term \nsustainability of the investments to be made and of those made under earlier ADB projects. \nOptions for incorporating the proposed policy reforms into the Project will be explored during the \nTA. To support sustainable quality and management improvements, the proposed Project will \nselect madrasah and pilot districts based on eligibility criteria to be developed during the TA that \nwill include good governance.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n17.  Major stakeholders, including MORA; MONE; national, regional, and local madrasah \noperators; local governments; district education councils; madrasah principals, teachers, and \nparents; and local communities, are among the groups that will be consulted during project \npreparation. Regular planning and consultation workshops will be held with representatives of \nthe districts selected for piloting the madrasah decentralization.  \n \n18.  The TA team will (i) update previous sector work; (ii) validate the proposed project \nframework; (iii) confirm the status of pending legislative amendments and regulations necessary \nfor decentralizing madrasah; (iv) liaise with the National Development Planning Agency and \nMONE on Government policy on financing of the private madrasah education sector; (v) select \nthe project districts; (vi) design and estimate the capacity building and resource requirements of \nthese districts; (vii) estimate the resources required for quality improvements in madrasah, and \nestablishing independent accreditation agencies in these districts; (viii) review the recruitment, \ndeployment, and preservice education of madrasah teachers and recommend more effective \n ", "    5\nsystems; (ix) estimate the resources needed to upgrade the management skills of foundations, \nschool committees, and principals; (x) recommend a new formula to use in allocating education \nbudgets to schools and madrasah; (xi) examine the feasibility of establishing endowment funds \nfor madrasah, design a scholarship scheme for poor students, and prepare a gender strategy; \n(xii) develop a project monitoring and evaluation system, develop guidelines and mechanisms to \nincrease accountability, and adopt measures to prevent fraud and corruption; (xiii) recommend \nways to strengthen project management skills and accountability; and (xiv) prepare a detailed \nassessment of district readiness in accordance with Government project readiness criteria. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.5 million equivalent, of which $804,000 \nequivalent is the foreign exchange cost and $696,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The \nGovernment has requested that a grant be provided of $1.2 million equivalent, covering the \nentire foreign exchange cost and $396,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. ADB will \nprovide $600,000 on a grant basis from the TA funding program. The Government of Australia \nwill cofinance $600,000 on a grant basis. The Australian funds will be administered by ADB. The \nGovernment will finance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $300,000, through \nthe provision of counterpart staff, local travel, office accommodation, and administrative and \nsecretarial support.  Cost  estimates  and  the  financing  plan  are  shown  in  Appendix  3.  The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any \nensuing Project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The  executing  agency  for  the  TA  will  be  MORA\u2019s  Directorate  General  of  Islamic \nInstitutions. Close collaboration will be maintained with the Office of the Secretary-General in \nMORA and the Task Force working on madrasah decentralization. MORA will set up a TA \nimplementation team, which will include representatives from MORA, National Development \nPlanning Agency, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Home Affairs, and MONE, that will meet \nmonthly to discuss all aspects of the project design. The TA will begin in March 2005 and end in \nSeptember 2005, with a 2-week break after 3 months to give the Government time to review the \nproposal and undertake national consultations. During the second phase, the consultants will \nrevise and finalize the project design in line with the feedback received. \n  \n21.   The  TA  will  require  29  person-months  of  international  and  32  person-months  of \ndomestic  consulting  services.  Using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method, \ninternational and domestic consultants will be recruited through an international consulting firm \nusing a full technical proposal in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nThe international consulting firm will be responsible for organizing and facilitating all workshops \nand  procuring  equipment.  Procurement  under  the  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Australia, and (ii) ADB providing the balance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $600,000, on a grant basis, to the Government of Indonesia for \npreparing the Madrasah Education Development Project, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n ", " 6 Appendix 1 \nPRELIMINARY PROJECT FRAMEWORK  \n       \n  Performance Indicators and  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nGoal       \nEnhanced quality and  \u2022  Net enrollment ratios for  \u2022  MORA and MONE   \nnationwide coverage of 9  primary and junior secondary  national and district   \nyears of compulsory basic  education increased  EMIS statistics    \neducation   \u2022  Disparities in coverage reduced     \n\u2022  Transition to senior secondary   \neducation from schools in rural \nand poor areas increased \nPurpose     \n\u2022  Increased enrollments in junior \nStrengthened madrasah  \u2022  District and national  Assumptions \nand senior secondary \nincrease access to quality  examination results  \u2022  A unitary basic \neducation with madrasah \neducation for poor  \u2022  District EMIS statistics  education system has \ncontributing to the increase \nstudents, girls, and hard-to- \u2022  District transition rates  been established.  \n\u2022  Increased net enrollment ratios \nreach groups   \u2022  Government at all levels \nin underserved areas \n  will support private \n  \u2022  Increased enrollment and  education.  \ncompletion rates among girls  \nRisk \n\u2022  Improved student performance \n\u2022  Regulations for \nin poor rural areas \nsuccessful \n\u2022  Reduced disparities in final \ndecentralization of \nexamination scores between \nmadrasah will not be \nschools and madrasah at all \nissued.  \nlevels  \n \n\u2022  Decreased repetition and \ndropout rates and increased \ncompletion and transition rates \nfor madrasah  \nOutputs       \nA.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia:   \n \nInadequate education is one of the most powerful determinants of poverty, and unequal access to educational \nopportunity is strongly correlated with income inequality. Madrasah contribute significantly to the Government\u2019s efforts \nto achieve universal basic education and serve the poor, enrolling 5 million children, or 13% of basic education \nstudents. However, reforms and investment are needed in the madrasah education sector to ensure quality education \nfor poor children and to meet the Millennium Developing Goal of ensuring that all children complete a full course of \nprimary education by 2015. Indonesia currently has a net enrollment ratio of 93% for primary education, with a \ncompletion rate of around 77%.   \nThe majority of madrasah serve poor rural and isolated communities. More than half the students are the children of \nfarmers and laborers. While most children in Indonesia have access to primary education, access to postprimary \neducation is often limited, especially in rural areas. Madrasah can play an important role in helping to achieve the \nnational goal of 9 years of compulsory education, because they are generally based in rural areas and enroll more \nthan 20% of students in the upper levels of basic education (grades 7\u20139).  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention  \nThe TA will build on existing madrasah community based systems for identifying and bringing into school those \nchildren that might otherwise not enroll.  The TA will develop a targeted scholarship program, identify expansion of \ncapacity through new classrooms where needed, and develop retrieval programs that aim to increase completion rates \nin primary education and transition rates to junior secondary education, focusing primarily on the needs of the poor \nwho have the lowest completion and transition rates. Remedial programs are also important to help children with weak \neducation backgrounds succeed academically and pass on to the next level. Most often these are children of poor \nhouseholds of parents with low academic achievement. Strong in-school support programs are thus needed. Other \nmeans will be explored with the madrasah communities to improve the performance of poor children including school \nhealth clinics to improve the health status of poor children and thereby promote a healthy environment.  \n  \nC.

The TA design will include extensive \nconsultations and workshops with the Ministry of Religious Affairs; the Ministry of National Education; national, \nregional, and local madrasah; local governments; district education councils; madrasah principals, teachers, and \nparents; and local communities.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:  \nA gender strategy will be prepared during TA implementation. Madrasah enroll slightly more girls than boys, but \nsignificantly more men than women are teachers and principals. The TA will pay special attention to how to increase \nthe number of female teachers, ensure representation by women on madrasah committees, etc. Another focus of the \nTA is to suggest ways of introducing gender-sensitive material into textbooks and to ensure that teacher training \nprograms build in incentives to ensure adequate participation by women.  \nHas an output been prepared?
