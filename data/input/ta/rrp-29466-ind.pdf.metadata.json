It is a high priority investment\nfor the government of West Bengal, and is designed to support\nthe  government\u2019s  move  to  devolve  responsibility  for  urban\nmanagement from the states to the municipal administrations.\nUnder the Project, a policy and institutional framework will be\nestablished to sustain the investments in sewerage and drainage,\nsolid  waste  management,  slum  improvements,  and  canal\nrehabilitation.  A  stakeholder  consultative  process,  woven  into\nevery aspect of the Project, will ensure the design is responsive\nto the community and addresses basic human needs. Assistance\nwill be provided to implement the Project, together with capacity\nbuilding to support municipal services.\nClassification Primary: human development\nSecondary: environment\nEnvironment Assessment Category B\nAn  initial  environmental  examination  was  undertaken;  the\nsummary is a core appendix.\nRationale Calcutta was prioritized for assistance because it suffers from\nsevere  environmental  problems,  and  has  a  municipal\ncorporation  that  has  implemented  progressive  urban\ngovernance  reforms  in  recent  years.  In  Calcutta,  urban\ninfrastructure deficiencies are clearly evident. In the project area,\nonly 17 percent of the population are connected to a sewerage\nsystem, and less than 50 percent of the area is covered by a\ndrainage system, which is grossly inadequate. Industrial wastes\nflow,  largely  untreated,  into  the  surrounding  environment,\nexposing the community to acids, toxic chemicals, paints, varnish,\nand  other  highly  toxic  compounds.  During  the  wet  season,\nflooding occurs frequently, resulting in widespread exposure to\npathogens,  particularly  in  the  low-lying  slum  areas.  The  high\npopulation  density  of  the  slum  settlements  remains  a  major\npublic  health  concern  with  regard  to  the  transmission  of\ncommunicable  diseases,  especially  tuberculosis.  Around  50\npercent of the target population in the project area live in slum\nhousing or worse; this represents around 700,000 people. An\nestimated 26-30 percent of the slum dwelling households in the\ntarget area fall below the poverty line \u2014 some 180,000-210,000\npeople, or 13-15 percent of the population in the project area.\nObjectives and Scope The Project comprises the highest priority investments under\nthe Municipal Calcutta Environment Improvement Program, a\nlong-term master plan prepared under Asian Development Bank\n(ADB) technical assistance. The objectives of the Project are to\n(i) improve the environment in the outer areas of Calcutta, (ii)\nreduce  poverty  in  the  low-income  areas  through  affordable", "iii\naccess  to  basic  urban  services,  (iii)  facilitate  community\nempowerment through participatory processes, (iv) protect the\nenvironment from adverse developmental impacts, and (v) help\ndevelop Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) as a proficient\nand autonomous municipality. The Project has six components:\nA.  a  stakeholder  consultation  process,  designed  to  promote\nstakeholder  participation,  support  policy  reform  through\nimproved  awareness,  and  educate  communities  about\nenvironmental  health  linkages;  B.  sewerage  and  drainage\nimprovements;  C.  solid  waste  management;  D.  slum\nimprovements; E. canal improvements; and F. implementation\nassistance and capacity building.\nCost Estimates The Project cost is estimated at $360 million equivalent, of which\n$103.7  million  is  foreign  currency  cost  and  $256.3  million\nequivalent  is  local  currency  cost.  Under  a  parallel  financing\nagreement  with  CMC,  the  Department  for  International\nDevelopment of the United Kingdom  will also provide grant\nfunding ($30 million equivalent) to support the comprehensive\ncapacity  building  program  required  to  sustain  the  project\ninvestments.\nFinancing Plan           ($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total Cost Percent\nExchange Currency\nADB 103.7 146.3 250.0 69\nState Government 0.0 54.6 54.6 15\nCMC 0.0 55.4 55.4 16\nTotal 103.7 256.3 360 100\nLoan Amount and Terms A loan of $250.0 million is proposed from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital\nresources for 25 years, including a grace period of 6 years, at\nADB\u2019s pool-based variable interest rate.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 31 December 2007\nImplementation Overall direction and guidance will be provided by a steering\nArrangements committee  under  the  minister,  municipal  affairs  and  urban\ndevelopment department, government of West Bengal.  A project\nmanagement unit will be established in each of the two executing\nagencies.  They  will  be  responsible  for  the  coordination  and\nmanagement of all project activities.

It will assist in implementing the intent of the\n74th  Constitutional  Amendment  Act,  bringing  about  a  greater\ndegree of independence for CMC, and reducing the financial\nburden of the state government. In addition, CMC staff, which\ncurrently  number  over  42,000,  will  benefit  from  an  improved\nworking  environment  and  skills  development.  The  Project  will\ndirectly benefit about 190,000 slum dwellers, 1.4 million people\nthrough improved sewerage and drainage, and about 5 million\npeople  through  improved  solid  waste  management.  Slum\nimprovements will assist the welfare of the dwellers through\nimproved  environmental  health  and  facilitating  their\nmainstreaming into the city economy. About 180,000-210,000 of\nthe slum dwellers live below the poverty line. In addition, the\nstakeholder  consultation  process  will  help  to  empower\ncommunities, and  give them confidence to participate in the\naffairs of their local area.", "I. THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on (i) a proposed\nloan  to  India  for  the  Calcutta  Environmental  Improvement  Project,  and  (ii)  the  proposed\nadministration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a grant to be provided for the capacity\nbuilding program under the Project by the Department for International Development of the\nUnited Kingdom (DFID).\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. In response to a request from the Government, a project preparatory technical assistance\n(TA) was provided to undertake a feasibility study and project design to develop investment\nproposals to improve the urban environment of Calcutta municipality.1 A loan fact-finding mission\nof the ADB visited India on 6-16 March 2000. Subsequently, a loan preappraisal mission2 visited\nIndia on 23 May-8 June 2000 and reached an agreement on the proposed project scope,\nestimated cost, financing and implementation arrangements, and other related details. The\npreappraisal mission was upgraded to appraisal status on 9 October 2000, following submission\nby CMC of a resettlement plan acceptable to ADB. This report is based on the findings of these\nADB missions, consultation with project beneficiaries, reports prepared by the TA consultants,\ndiscussions with the central and state governments and the executing agencies, and discussions\nwith other international assistance agencies. Appendix 1 sets out the project design in a logical\nframework.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA. Urban Sector\n1. India\n3. The face of urban India has changed dramatically during recent decades. India\u2019s central\nand state governments have made considerable progress in bringing about economic reforms\nand greater liberalization, which has resulted in the emergence of cities as the engines of\neconomic growth. India\u2019s cities now contribute over 50 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic\nproduct (GDP), and their economies are growing so rapidly that they are expected to contribute\nover 60 percent to India\u2019s GDP by the year 2001. More than 90 percent of all government\nrevenues come from its cities. There has been a price to pay for this growth, however. The\ndemand for labor has attracted many rural migrants, whose increasing numbers have swelled\nthe population particularly in the slums and poorer sections of society. The urban population in\n1997 was over 260 million, and is projected to grow to nearly 300 million by 2001 and 550\nmillion by 2020. Urban population growth is largely concentrated in cities having populations of\n100,000 or more (Class I), and   especially   in   the   megacities    (populations in excess of 10\nmillion).   India   currently   has    two  megacities  (Calcutta and Mumbai)   and      is\nexpected     to   have six by 2025. In the Class I cities, and particularly the megacities, up to 30\n                                                \n1  TA 3089-IND: Calcutta Environmental Improvement Project, for $1,000,000, approved on 16 October 1998.\n2  The mission comprised G. Jackson, Sr. Project Engineer and Mission Leader; K. Gerhaeusser, Sr. Programs\nOfficer;  A.  Goswami,  Counsel;  R.  Jayewardene,  Social  Development  Specialist;  S.  Popov,  Environmental\nSpecialist and I. Walker, Financial Analyst (staff consultant).", "2\npercent of the total population is \u201cfloating\u201d, i.e., people who come into the city on a daily basis\nto seek employment.\n4. Investment and development has not kept pace with the rising demand of the urban\npopulations,  resulting  in  severe  price  distortions,  environmental  degradation,  poor\nenvironmental health, and increasing poverty levels. The growing population pressures are\nplacing urban infrastructure and municipal services under a great strain. The 1991 census\nrecorded that only one half of urban households have access to safe drinking water, sanitation,\nor electricity, with an estimated 5 percent of households deprived of all of these basic services.\nFurther, less than 50 percent of wastewater is actually collected, and much less is treated.\nEnvironmental health conditions are consequently poor for many sections of society, but none\nmore so than the slums and poorer groups, where conditions are rapidly deteriorating. National\npoverty levels are over 30 percent.\n5. Historically, funding of urban development and services has been provided primarily by\nthe central and state governments, and to a lesser extent by municipalities. However, because\nthe municipalities are unable to mobilize much in financial resources, the central and state\ngovernments find it necessary to finance almost all capital investment and subsidize recurrent\ncosts in the urban sector. Due to funding constraints, such assistance is also very limited.\nMaintaining and increasing the productivity of India\u2019s cities however will require substantial\ninvestments in the urban sector. Although this is well recognized by the Government, it is not\nable to provide adequate financial support to all urban centers, and is encouraging state\ngovernments and municipalities to assume greater responsibility for their own socioeconomic\ndevelopment.  In  this  respect,  the  74th  Constitutional  Amendment  Act  (74th  CAA),  1992,\nprovides  a  legal  framework  for  decentralized  governance  down  to  the  municipal  level.  In\nsupport  of  this  legislation,  the  Government  has  been  progressively  working  toward  more\nequitable tax sharing arrangements between the central, state, and municipal government\nlevels,  and  has  been  encouraging  enhanced  mobilization  of  local  financial  resources.  In\nconcert with their state governments, several municipalities have made some progress with\nimplementing the intent of the 74th CAA, including the megacity of Calcutta, and the cities of\nAhmedabad and Bangalore. However, further and substantial progress needs to be achieved\nin this area to meet future urban needs.\n6. The ability of the governments to meet the funding requirements of the sector is under\nthreat, as the combined fiscal position of the central and state governments has worsened\nsignificantly since the mid-1990s. The state governments\u2019 fiscal positions are of particular\ninterest, as they are principally responsible, together with the municipalities, for providing social\nservices  and  infrastructure  development.  It  is  vital  for  the  welfare  of  urban  communities\neverywhere, and especially the poor, that the state governments and their municipalities fully\nimplement the intent and provisions of the 74th CAA. This will require settling issues such as\ndebt financing, municipal financial management, urban planning, and mobilization of local\nfinancial resources. Currently, these issues are significant constraints to financing of urban\nservices.\n2. Calcutta\n7. The Calcutta metropolitan area (CMA) is the capital of the State of West Bengal, and\nthe  most  populous  city  in  India.  CMA  comprises  three  municipal  corporations,  34\nmunicipalities, and several village-level committee areas; covers 1,380 square kilometers (km2);\nand has about 12 million people. The nucleus of the city is the Calcutta municipality, which\ncovers 187 km2 and", "3\nhouses an estimated 4.5 million people, which is about 40 percent of CMA\u2019s population. Municipal\nadministration in Calcutta dates from 1727. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) Act, which\nwas introduced in 1980, is a progressive legislation that contains much of the reform currently\nunder consideration in the urban sector in India, and was enacted well before the 74th CAA. The\nCMC Act established the municipal concept of a corporation governed by the elected Mayor-in-\nCouncil (MIC), which elects the mayor.3 The executive power of the corporation is exercised by\nthe MIC, comprising the mayor, deputy mayor, and 10 other elected members of the corporation,\neach having responsibility for a specific function. The mayor is CMC\u2019s chief executive officer, and\nthe state-appointed municipal commissioner is the principal executive officer.4 The municipal\ncommissioner reports to the mayor and supervises and controls all CMC officers and employees.\n8. The MIC is represented at the local level by elected borough committees and ward\ncouncils, which have responsibility for limited and specific functions of the CMC. The CMC is\nmade up of 15 boroughs, containing about 141 wards. Each ward is represented by an elected\ncouncilor, who sits on the borough committee. The functions of the municipality are discharged\nthrough its executive officers and staff who number over 42,000 and are stationed in the head\noffice and the borough and ward offices.\n9. In 1970, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) was established by\nthe state government to facilitate the development of Calcutta\u2019s urban areas, with a mandate\nfor urban planning and implementation. CMDA has been the vehicle for much of the larger\ncapital investments made in the CMA, including the Ganga Action Plan (GAP), which was\ndeveloped in the late 1960s to address the severe flooding and sanitation problems. Since that\ntime, CMDA has been gradually constructing the sewerage and drainage works under the\nGAP,  with  assistance  from  the  World  Bank.    Following  commissioning  of  these  works,\nownership was to be transferred to the municipalities. However, human resource constraints\nwithin  the  municipalities  and  limited  cost  recovery  levels  prevented  the  level  of  transfer\nanticipated.  Consequently,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the  commissioned  water\nsupply and sewerage assets is currently shared by CMDA and the municipalities. In addition to\nthe GAP schemes, CMC has been making small but significant investments in water supply\nand sewerage, funded from its own resources and to a more limited extent in conjunction with\nthe private sector on some small build-own-transfer projects. However, such private sector\ninitiatives  remain  small  because  the  sector  is  not  yet  sufficiently  developed  to  attract\ncommercial proposals and no regulatory framework exists.\n10. CMC\u2019s obligatory functions under the CMC Act, 1980, include water supply, sewerage\nand drainage, solid waste management, streets, building regulations, community health and\nenvironmental sanitation, some town planning, and land-use control. The Act permits additional\ndiscretionary functions: CMC has found it necessary to become involved in education and\nhealth. CMC\u2019s sources of funding for these services include the consolidated rate charge\n(similar to property tax), permits and licenses, and state government transfers. The transfers\nrepresent about 50 percent of the total revenue.\n11. CMC uses both surface and groundwater sources for water supply, and has traditionally\nassigned a very high importance to this subsector. Consequently, over 85 percent of the CMC\npopulation now have access to a piped water supply. Sewerage has not enjoyed the same\nlevel of investment, which is reflected in the fact that      only  50 percent of the CMC population\nhave   a sewer    connection .   However, in   the  outer areas   of   CMC,  this   figure  drops  to\n                                                \n3  An MIC is an elected municipal cabinet.\n4  The municipal commissioner may be proposed by the MIC.", "4\nabout 17 percent. The older systems in the inner core area, many of which are over 100 years\nold, are generally combined systems, conveying stormwater as well as sewage and/or effluent.\nSeparate sewerage systems are becoming increasingly common, particularly in the newer\nouter areas. The sewage, effluent, and stormwater from the inner core area of Calcutta is\nconveyed by canal to the eastern wetland areas, where it is assimilated into the environment of\nthe low-lying swamp areas. The sewage, effluent, and stormwater from the outer areas is\nconveyed by canal to receiving waters such as the Ganges River. Calcutta\u2019s flat topography\nnecessitates pumping of virtually all of the sewage, effluent, and stormwater to the points of\ndischarge. The flat topography leads to severe and rapid silting of many of the canals and\ndrains, which aggravates flooding. Solid waste collection is quite high in the inner core areas,\ncovering about 70-90 percent of the urban population, whereas collection efficiency in the outer\nareas is much lower. Solid waste is disposed of at three sites in the Calcutta area. Although\nthere is some limited collection and separate disposal of hazardous and biomedical wastes,\nmuch enters the waste stream and becomes part of the municipal waste at the landfill sites.\nCMC has a Bustee Services Cell, which provides support to bustees (slum or low-income\ncommunities). Registered bustees represent around 30 percent of the population in the fringe\nof Calcutta, with refugee colonies, unregistered bustees, and illegal squatters representing\naround 9 percent.\n12. The rapid urbanization of Calcutta has placed a considerable burden on the urban\nenvironment. Calcutta is thought to currently have a population four times the size that it can\ncomfortably accommodate: CMC\u2019s average density is over 24,000 people/km2, one of the\nhighest densities in India. Where sanitation facilities, and sewerage and drainage systems are\nas yet undeveloped, the overcrowding in the traditional working-class settlements creates\nserious pollution problems. A lack of housing has forced many of the poor to illegally occupy\npublic lands, such as the banks of drainage canals, which constricts flows and leads to further\nenvironmental pollution. Around half of the CMC population live in slum settlements, which are\ntypically in low-lying areas where solid and liquid wastes accumulate. Unsanitary conditions\ncan develop quickly, as inadequate drainage and flood events disperse the wastes in the areas\nof the slum communities. This results in the contamination of wells used by many poor and\nvulnerable groups.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n13. Within the constitutional framework of India, urban development and housing are state\nresponsibilities, and the central Government plays only a catalytic and supportive role. The\ncentral Government\u2019s major role in the urban sector is to formulate broad policies at the\nnational level, frame legislation, and provide financial support through centrally sponsored\nschemes and financial institutions. The mobilization of external assistance and the creation of\nan appropriate fiscal climate are also important roles.\n14. Although India does not yet have a national urban policy, a draft has been prepared,\nand was released following passage of the 74th CAA. The draft is being reviewed by the central\nGovernment\u2019s Ministry of Urban Development and Poverty Alleviation. There is now a broad\nconsensus that a national policy is required to define and implement the provisions of the 74th\nCAA, to identify policy reform initiatives, and to outline the country's strategies. The central\nGovernment prepares five-year development plans, but the emphasis is essentially on housing\nrather than urban development. Both the eighth (1992-1997) and the ninth (1997-2002) five-\nyear plans are based on the Government\u2019s National Housing Policy, adopted in 1994. The\nninth plan now promotes the role of state and local governments as managers of", "5\nthe whole housing and urban development process, and expects them to establish efficient\nlinkages between the components of the process to optimize the efforts of the stakeholders.\nThe  ninth  plan  also  promotes  legal,  institutional,  and  fiscal  reform  initiatives  aimed  at\nenhancing market-based approaches to housing and urban development.\n15. National initiatives reflect the central Government\u2019s priorities in the urban sector\u2014the\nprovision of urban infrastructure and the reduction of poverty. Two such initiatives are the\nMegacity  Scheme  and  Integrated  Development  of  Small  and  Medium  Towns  Scheme.  In\naddition,  there  have  been  important  central  programs  for  poverty  reduction,  such  as  the\nSwarana Jayanti Shahri Rozgar Yojana (golden jubilee urban employment program), and the\nurban self-employment scheme. These schemes emphasize the provision of basic services to\nurban  poor,  enhancing  their  employment  and  income  generation  opportunities  through\nprograms like microcredit and their close participation in urban project implementation. In\naddition, in April 1999, the Government prepared a draft national slum improvements policy.\n16. The most important legislation affecting the urban sector in recent years is the 74th\nCAA, which provides the framework for the devolution of power from the state to the municipal\nlevel and below. Since enactment of the 74th CAA, municipal elections are held in all states,\nstate election commissions have been established, borough committees and ward councils\nhave been elected, many district and metropolitan planning committees have been elected,\nand state finance commissions have been established to recommend measures to achieve\ndevolution. At the state level, the government of West Bengal established the State Finance\nCommission in 1995, which recommended a more equitable tax sharing arrangement between\nthe state and the municipalities. Municipal elections were initiated following enactment of the\n74th  CAA;  and  CMC  held  elections  for  the  second  time  in  June  2000.  Furthermore,  the\nestablishment of a Calcutta Metropolitan Planning Committee is now underway following the\nmunicipal elections. At the municipal level, the CMC Act, 1980, is progressive legislation.\nPreceding the 74th CAA by almost 12 years, it contains many of the provisions on cost recovery\nand devolved functions called for by the national legislation.\n17. In  the  1990s,  faced  with  severe  environmental  degradation  and  a  growing  urban\npoverty  problem,  the  government  of  West  Bengal  prepared  two  long-term  and  important\ndocuments\u2014 the Basic Development Plan and the Master Plan for Water Supply, Sewerage\nand Drainage, Calcutta Metropolitan District (1996-2001). These plans, which address the\ninstitutional  and  planning  aspects  of  development  as  well  as  the  physical  investment\nrequirements,  have  been  progressively  implemented  since  that  time.  Calcutta  has  also\nbenefited from the Government\u2019s Megacity Scheme, which promotes the building of revolving\nfunds  for  sustained  investment  in  urban  infrastructure  through  the  adoption  of  direct  and\nindirect cost recovery measures including bond issues.5 Under the Basic Development Plan,\nthe Bustee Improvement Program (BIP) began implementation in 1970, and is sometimes\nknown as the \u201csanitation model of slum improvement.\u201d The program was very successful. In\n1990, it had covered about 2 million of the 3 million bustee population in the metropolitan area,\nand about 300,000 of the 1 million people living in refugee colonies. Since that time, further\nschemes have been initiated such as the Basic Minimum Services Scheme, and the Refugee\nColony Improvement Scheme. The Project design is founded on these plans and schemes,\nand has been developed to take account of contemporary urban demands.\n                                                \n5  The  megacity  scheme  was  introduced  following  the  recommendations  of  the  National  Commission  on\nUrbanization (Government of India, 1998), and covers the cities of Calcutta, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, and\nBangalore.", "6\n18. Calcutta\u2019s  development  has  been  the  subject  of  several  national  and  state  plans.\nCalcutta\u2014City of Joy (CMC, 1986) was the first comprehensive development program that\nCMC had produced. Although only a small part of the plan has been implemented, it remains\nsignificant for its breadth of vision. In 1990, the Perspective Plan for Calcutta 2011 (State\nPlanning Board, 1990) and the Plan for Metropolitan Development 1990-2015 (CMDA, 1990)\nwere released; these documents took the view that Calcutta\u2019s development should be viewed\nas an integral part of the state\u2019s urban development. Then, in 1995, the Calcutta Environmental\nManagement Strategy and Action Plan was drawn up to improve the environment in CMA for\nits 12 million citizens. Finally, in 1996, the government of West Bengal approved the Land Use\nand Development Control Plan for CMC Area, a useful tool for the future development of the\ncity. The physical layout of the Project has been developed within the general directions of the\nspatial framework laid down for Calcutta by these plans.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n19. ADB\u2019s operations in the urban sector commenced in 1993, and include six loans with a\ntotal value of $1.33 billion\u2014Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development Project, the Housing\nFinance  Project,  Rajasthan  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  Project,  Karnataka  Urban\nDevelopment  and  Coastal  Environmental  Management  Project,  Urban  and  Environment\nInfrastructure Facility and Housing Finance II Project.6 In addition, ADB has provided 15 TAs\namounting to $7.15 million over seven years for the preparation of projects and capacity\nbuilding. ADB\u2019s assistance has concentrated on generating ownership of investments, poverty\nreduction, cost recovery, transparency, and good governance. Appendix 2 sets out external\nassistance in detail.\n20. External  assistance  to  the  sector  from  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies,\nincluding Germany, Japan, Netherlands, United Kingdom, United States, and the World Bank,\nhas been increasing over the past few years. Funding equivalent to $1.9 billion has been\nprovided  for  water  supply  and  sanitation,  primarily  from  the  Japan  Bank  for  International\nCooperation and the World Bank. The states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and\nTamil Nadu, have been the principal beneficiaries of this assistance. In addition, Rajasthan\nState  has  received  concessional  loans  from  Germany  for  improving  water  supply  and\nsanitation  in  selected  cities.  The  assistance  has  focused  on  improved  water  supply,\nenvironmental  sanitation,  housing,  public  health,  slum  rehabilitation,  access  to  financial\nservices,  employment  and  income  generating  opportunities,  institutional  development  and\ncapacity building, and enhancement of cost recovery levels. As with ADB, the major thrust of\nall the key agencies is poverty reduction.\n21. One of the most significant external assistance programs to Calcutta commenced in\n1962, when the World Health Organization (WHO) commissioned the preparation of a master\nplan for water supply, sewerage, and drainage for the greater Calcutta area. In 1972, the World\nBank  provided  loan  assistance  for  CMDA  to  implement  the  Calcutta  Urban  Development\nProject, which included water supply, sewerage, and drainage. The World Bank provided two\nfollow-on  projects  (1978-1979  and  1984-1992)  which  included  programs  for  low-income\ncommunities to improve their health, education, employment generation, and capacities. In\n1991, DFID provided grant assistance to CMDA for the Calcutta Slum Improvement Project\n                                                \n6 Loans 1415/1416-IND, for $105 million, approved on 14 December 1995; 1549/1550/1551-IND, for $300 million,\napproved on 25 September 1997; 1647-IND, for $250 million, approved on 3 December 1998; 1704-IND, for $175\nmillion, approved on 26 October 1999; 1719/1720/1721-IND, for $200 million, approved on 17 December 1999,\nand 1758/1759/1760/1761-IND, for $300 million approved on 21 September 2000.", "7\n(CSIP), which sought to build on the experiences of previous slum improvements, but placed\ngreater emphasis on community participation. In 1995, DFID provided further grant assistance\nto the government of West Bengal for the Calcutta Environmental Management Strategy and\nAction Plan (CEMSAP), which sought to develop an integrated approach to address Calcutta\u2019s\nenvironmental problems. The Project design is consistent with the principles and strategies\ndeveloped  under  CEMSAP.  More  recently,  DFID  has  arranged  grant  assistance  for  the\nCalcutta Urban Services Project (CUSP), which assists several municipalities adjacent to CMC\nfor capacity building in municipal and environmental management. The Project will have strong\nlinkages with the CUSP, as they share many common issues and are geographically very\nclose.\n22. One of the key lessons related to external support shared by all external funding\nagencies is that investment alone is not adequate to achieve the desired goals. Investment has\nto be supported by a number of other inputs including a strong policy reform agenda, capacity\nbuilding, improved governance, institutional restructuring, and establishment of partnerships\nbetween public and private agencies.\nD. Lessons Learned\n23. The proposed Project is the seventh loan to the Government in the sector. Three\nprojects are being implemented, two in Karnataka and the other in Rajasthan.7 Although some\nlessons can be drawn from all ADB\u2019s projects, those from the Karnataka Urban Infrastructure\nDevelopment Project (KUIDP) are most relevant to the Project. The lessons learned from the\nother projects are very similar to those of the KUIDP. Appendix 3 provides a detailed summary\nof  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  the  sector.  Key  areas  for  consideration  include  advance  action,\ncommunity  awareness  and  participation,  implementation  arrangements,  contracting\narrangements, land acquisition, and legislative reform.\n24. The KUIDP\u2019s executing agency (EA) took nine months to mobilize the consultants.\nAlthough the EA estimates that the KUIDP will be completed within the six-year implementation\nschedule, advance action on the recruitment of consultants would have helped significantly in\nachieving an early completion. ADB\u2019s experience with this project, with respect to community\nawareness, empowerment, and ownership, also shows that substantial time (12-18 months) is\nneeded  to  establish  the  stakeholder  groups.  Developing  the  trust  necessary  to  carry  out\nphysical works and engendering community involvement takes a concerted effort by the EA,\nthe  local  government,  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  The  NGOs  need  to  be\nincluded early in the project preparation process.\n25. The roles of the various implementing agencies were not well defined initially, neither\nwere they adequately staffed in terms of capability and numbers. As a result, progress was\nslow initially. Following a more detailed definition of roles and more attention to staffing,\nimplementation is proceeding satisfactorily. Progress on the KUIDP is also being affected by\ndifficulties due to poor planning and late release of counterpart funding. Counterpart funding\nrequirements, together with a solid commitment, must be clearly agreed and set out during\nprocessing, and during each year of implementation. Tender documents for the KUIDP differed\nin a number of respects to those normally used in the sector in India, such as the cost of third\n                                                \n7 Loan No.1415-IND: Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development Project,  for  $85  million,  approved  on  14\nDecember 1995, Loan No.1647-IND: Rajasthan Urban Infrastructure Development Project, for $250 million,\napproved  on  3  December  1998  and  Loan  No.  1704-IND:  Karnataka Urban Development and Coastal\nEnvironmental Management Project, for $175 million, approved on 26 October 1999.", "8\nparty inspection, risk associated with fixed price contracts, the cost of performance bonds,\nquality control and interest costs. The domestic contractors must be provided with very clear\ninstructions on ADB requirements. Prequalification of contractors must be undertaken carefully,\nand  should  be  accompanied  by  some  measures,  such  as  workshops,  to  educate  the\ncontracting industry.\n26. Land acquisition is the major source of delay in the KUIDP, taking over two years to\ncomplete. The KUIDP experience demonstrates the need to establish a solid legal framework\nfor land acquisition during loan processing to avoid unnecessary delays. Consideration should\nalso be given to phased conditionalities to ensure intermediate land acquisition proceeds in a\ntimely manner. Under the KUIDP, a change in property tax valuation was sought, from a rental\nbasis to an area and capital value basis. Difficulties in implementing the reforms primarily result\nbecause the legal framework was not clearly established before attempting to introduce the\nnecessary reforms. Such legal amendments must be agreed and passed well in advance of the\nlogistics required to effect such change.\nE. ADB\u2019s Sectoral Strategy\n27. In India, ADB\u2019s overall strategic objectives are to foster sustained economic growth to\ncreate employment and reduce poverty. In the urban sector, and in accordance with ADB\u2019s\noverarching objective of poverty reduction, the strategy stresses the importance of focused\nprograms targeting the poorer groups, which form the basis for or are integrated into the overall\ndesign  of  projects.  ADB  will  also  promote  policy  reform  measures  to  address  the  legal,\ninstitutional, and financial constraints in the urban sector. These reform measures will be aimed\nat liberalizing India\u2019s land and housing markets to attract more private sector investment into\nthe sector.\n28. ADB\u2019s Urban Sector Strategy for India is to assist with urban (i) infrastructure and\nservices, (ii) transportation, and (iii) housing. For urban infrastructure and services, ADB will\ncontinue to support integrated urban development projects to improve urban environments and\nliving conditions, especially for the poorer groups, and to strengthen the capacity of local\ngovernments in the implementation of projects and delivery of services. Such support will be\nused  as  the  basis  for  implementing  the  decentralization  provisions  of  the  74th  CAA,  and\nintroducing  and  demonstrating  financial  sustainability  measures.  In  future,  ADB  will\ncomplement these efforts with assistance in the establishment of urban and environmental\ninfrastructure  funds,  which  will  attract  public  and  private  sector  capital  to  finance  urban\ndevelopment.\n29. With regard to urban transportation, transport systems management will be a focus of\nADB assistance, either in conjunction with integrated urban development projects or as single\nprojects, to promote low-cost alternative measures that reduce congestion and increase road\ncapacity by regulating the movement of intracity traffic. ADB will help prepare transport system\nmanagement plans, complemented by capacity building in their implementation, enforcement,\nand monitoring.\n30. ADB will provide assistance to the housing subsector in the three areas: (i) lending to\nfinancial intermediaries as a means to link the formal and informal housing finance sectors,\nthereby  increasing  the  availability  and  affordability  of  housing  finance  to  low-income\nhouseholds; (ii) support to low-income housing subprojects with a particular emphasis on using", "9\nmicrocredit schemes for housing and income generation loans; and (iii) provision of TA for\nsecondary mortgage development.\n31. All ADB\u2019s urban sector programs will incorporate capacity building initiatives aimed at\npromoting sustainable urban management. In general, ADB\u2019s approach to capacity building will\nbe  to  support  the  intent  and  provisions  of  the  74th  CAA.  Urban  management  therefore\nconstitutes the principal focus of ADB\u2019s urban sector capacity building program.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n32. Since 1993, ADB and the Government have maintained dialogue on urban policy and\nrelated  institutional  and  financial  reforms.  ADB-assisted  urban  development  projects  in\nKarnataka and Rajasthan were milestones for urban development, built on key policy reforms,\nwhich  fully  supported  the  central  and  state  governments\u2019  efforts  to  decentralize  urban\nmanagement  responsibilities  to  local  governments.  During  project  processing,  ADB  has\npursued  an  active  policy  dialogue  with  the  government  on  institutional,  financial,  and\noperational aspects of the sector. The content of the dialogue builds on recent CMC initiatives,\ntogether with the policy reform agreed on previous ADB projects, which has been developed to\naddress contemporary issues. Appendix 4 provides a matrix of the policy and institutional\nreform agenda.\n33. The policy dialogue has benefited from the stakeholder workshops conducted since TA\ninception, and from CMC\u2019s general participatory approach for the Project. Accordingly, there is\na broad agreement with CMC on a number of policy issues. In view of the progressive nature\nof  the  CMC  Act,  1980,  reforms  focus  on  a  few  key  issues,  relating  to  the  creation  of\nframeworks  for  the  sustainable  management  of  municipal  services,  enhanced  levels  of\nresource mobilization, CMC\u2019s future role and function, and CMC\u2019s improved capability and\nefficiency. ADB and CMC are also engaged in dialogue on the benefits of pursuing stakeholder\nparticipation.\n34. Sustainable  Delivery  of  Urban  Services.  The  CMC  Act,  1980,  and  the\nrecommendations of the State Finance Commission, 1995, provide the principal framework for\nmanaging CMC. The State Finance Corporation recommended a more equitable sharing of\ntaxes between government of West Bengal and CMC. Specifically, it recommended that 16\npercent of the tax revenue collected by the state should be transferred to local bodies, of which\nCMC\u2019s share would be 3.9 percent. Further key recommendations were that the state should\nsupport 100 percent of the cost-of-living allowance that CMC is obliged to pay to its staff, and\nthat CMC\u2019s share of the entertainment tax should be increased from 50 to 100 percent. The\ngovernment has accepted these recommendations, and appropriate transfers will be made in\nFY2002. The budgetary allocations that the state has historically been required to provide for\nwater supply and bustee services (on a matching grant basis), are not likely to be continued.\nHowever, since these allocations have not been made for several years, CMC should be in a\nposition of net fiscal gain with the new arrangements. The new measures will have a significant\nand beneficial impact on CMC\u2019s financial position.\n35. Direct user charges have not been traditionally applied by CMC for water supply,\nsewerage, drainage, or solid waste management (SWM). Funding for capital investments has\nbeen met either by CMC from its consolidated account, or by the government of West Bengal\nthrough budgetary allocation. Provision for recurrent costs is nominally from the consolidated\nrate charge, which CMC is permitted to collect under the CMC Act. The charge, which is", "10\ncommonly  referred  to  as  a  property  tax,  covers  many  services,  including  water  supply,\nsewerage, and SWM. According to the CMC Act, 45 percent of the charge is to be allocated to\ncover the recurrent costs for water supply, sewerage, and SWM\u201415 percent for each service.\nIn recent years, CMC has only been able to allocate 9-15 percent for water supply, and 7-10\npercent for sewerage and drainage. However, SWM has enjoyed allocations of 17-22 percent.\nLess than 50 percent of the consolidated rate charge is collected, which is undermining CMC\u2019s\nefforts to generate more revenue. CMC has agreed to a time-bound action plan to improve the\ncollections to 80 percent by FY2005. Since the consolidated rate charge must cover many\nother municipal services, CMC has agreed to change the name of the tax from consolidated\nrate charge to property tax.\n36. Currently, the consolidated rate charge is assessed at fair rental rates for the annual\nratable value (ARV). With this method, it is almost impossible to achieve full market rental for a\nproperty, thereby constraining revenue. The absence of an organized real estate market leads\nto the underreporting of rents and capital value in transactions. Further, the wide discretionary\npowers of assessment staff can lead to gross underassessments of ARV. In the case of CMC\nspecifically, the tax rate is capped at 40 percent, and any property having an ARV of Rs300 or\nless is exempt from tax. CMC has agreed to reform the method of assessing the consolidated\nrate charge so it is rated on an area basis, with some consideration for capital value; this will\nenhance revenues considerably. An amendment to the CMC Act will be required, together with\nissuance of rules under the CMC Act. Properties will also have to be revalued. The CMC has\nagreed to undertake these tasks under the Project. A committee has been established to\nevaluate similar models in India.\n37. In addition to the allocation from the consolidated rate charge, the CMC Act also\nenables the corporation to generate revenue for water supply services through the application\nof direct user charges. However, until very recently there was no metering in the city, and only\nthe relatively small percentage of consumers with a ferrule (water connection) size greater than\n20 millimeters (mm) diameter were required to pay on a flat rate basis. Now, CMC has\ncommenced a metering program under which a few industrial, commercial, and institutional\n(ICI) consumers have been metered and are beginning to pay by volume consumed. CMC has\nagreed to increase the cost recovery levels of water supply. This will commence with the\nprogressive application of a flat rate to consumers not having a meter, in parallel with CMC\u2019s\nprogram to gradually expand metering to all consumers. Subject to the findings of a current\nWorld Bank study on water supply in Calcutta, consumer metering will expand, and consumers\nwill be required to pay for the water supply service on the basis of a structured tariff. CMC has\nalso agreed that the 15 percent allocation toward the cost of supply from the consolidated rate\ncharge will remain for the medium term.\n38. Although the CMC Act permits user charges to be applied to ICI establishments for the\nprovision of sewerage services, it does not permit them for residences. CMC has tentatively\nagreed at this stage that the CMC Act, 1980, should be amended to permit the implementation\nof user charges for sewerage and drainage as a surcharge on the water supply bill. It has also\nbeen agreed to retain the 15 percent allocation from the consolidated rate charge for sewerage\nand drainage, and rename it as an environmental charge.\n39. As  with  sewerage,  the  CMC  Act  permits  user  charges  to  be  applied  to  ICI\nestablishments for SWM, but also excludes residences. CMC has agreed that the ICI charges\nwill be reviewed to reflect the environmental cost of sanitary disposal, especially for biomedical\nand hazardous wastes. A direct user charge for solid waste collection for residences is the", "11\nideal long-term goal, but political resistance to implement this charge, in addition to the water\nsupply and sewerage charges, would be insurmountable at this time. Therefore, the 15 percent\nallocation from the consolidated rate charge will be retained for SWM activities for the short- to\nmedium-term.\n40. Institutional Development. CMC has indicated its intention to establish a water supply\nand sewerage utility, which will operate on corporate principles. This type of reform requires a\nthorough assessment of the water supply subsector, and an implementation program spanning\nseveral years. The current World Bank study will prepare a framework for the reform program,\nincluding a detailed assessment of the subsector, and the compilation of a comprehensive\nconsumer database. The success of the policy and institutional reform agenda under the\nProject will be reinforced by the expected outcomes of the World Bank study.\n41. CMC has noted that the satisfactory operation of the sewerage component of the Project\nrequires  water,  which  would  normally  be  supplied  from  a  reticulated  system.  Current\nassessments show that coverage levels are quite high, and the mayor announced in his budget\nspeech  on  11  March  2000  that  a  substantial  amount  would  be  invested  in  water  supply\ndevelopment in the next fiscal year in the project area, with a plan to invest even more in the\nfuture. CMC has a medium-term investment plan, including sources of funding for water supply\nand sewerage, indicating investment in the project area.\n42. Because  of  the  considerable  demand  for  urban  infrastructure  and  services  in  the\ngreater Calcutta area, the government established the CMDA as a metropolitan implementing\nagency with access to central Government and external funding for major water supply and\nsewerage infrastructure development. For this purpose, the CMDA has specifically established\nthe Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sewerage Authority, under the CMDA umbrella. Following\nimplementation,  CMC  becomes  the  operator  of  the  assets  within  its  area  of  jurisdiction.\nAlthough CMC is bound by this regulatory requirement, it will not assume ownership of the\nasset until it is operating satisfactorily. Consequently, many assets remain under the control of\nthe CMDA. CMC has now agreed to develop a time-bound program for transfer of the backlog\nof assets, including actions to be undertaken. CMC understands that the enhanced levels of\ncost recovery resulting from the Project will ensure the sustainability of the newly acquired\nassets. The responsibility for all health and slum improvement programs implemented by\nCMDA is now with CMC.\n43. Decentralization. In terms of its functions, CMC will assume a greater role in planning\nits  urban  areas  in  the  future,  in  accordance  with  the  74th  CAA.  Following  the  municipal\nelections in June 2000, ADB was informed that a metropolitan planning committee is now\nbeing established, and that CMC would be represented on this committee. This will give CMC\na much greater role in the planning of its urban area.\n44. Governance. CMC is the largest municipal administration in India and has over 42,000\nstaff. Although its responsibilities are considerable, CMC recognizes that it is overstaffed. A\nmajor cause of the overstaffing is the practice of staff handing down their positions to relatives\nand friends upon retirement. CMC issued a directive in February 2000 ceasing this practice.\nCMC\u2019s total staff number will decline through natural attrition in the next few years. This\nrationalization process will be accompanied by a reorganization of CMC and redeployment of\nits staff to meet the challenges of the future. CMC\u2019s workforce is to be reduced by least 10\npercent by FY2007. Guided by the loan covenants, and assisted by the extensive capacity\nbuilding program under the Project, CMC will develop into an efficient and autonomous", "12\nmegacity corporation. New accounting and auditing systems will be installed, together with\nasset management systems, and geographic and financial management information systems\n(MISs).\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n45. Calcutta Municipality was selected as a high priority for ADB assistance in the urban\nsector because it (i) suffers from severe environmental problems, (ii) has a high percentage of\npoor  people,  (iii)  has  a  municipal  corporation  that  has  implemented  progressive  urban\ngovernance reforms in recent years, (iv) has demonstrated willingness to implement further\nreforms, and (v) will serve as a useful model for other large municipalities.\n46. The Calcutta Municipality can be broadly classified into an inner core area where\npopulation densities are very high, and the outer urban areas where populations are less\ndense. The urban environmental infrastructure in the inner core area is among the oldest in\nIndia, with some drainage systems around 140 years old, and in urgent need of rehabilitation\nand upgrading. In the outer fringe areas, sewerage and drainage infrastructure is seriously\ndeficient. Reticulated water supply systems cover around 30 percent of the 1.4 million people\nin the project area, and a further 43 percent have tubewell supplies. Groundwater supplies are\nbeing gradually replaced by reticulated systems, as more booster pumping stations and mains\nare constructed. Although water supply coverage is improving, substantial further investment is\nneeded. CMC has agreed to provide ADB with a detailed investment plan for water supply over\nthe next five years, which will demonstrate how full coverage will be achieved.\n47. The population density of the inner urban areas of Calcutta is very high at around\n29,000 people/km2, falling to around 7,000/km2 in the outer areas. The density distribution is\npresently skewed toward the inner core area and some outer areas, where densities are up to\nfour times more than can be supported on a sustainable basis. Population densities are\nexpected to become more even. Nevertheless, the overall population of the project area is\nexpected to increase by 2.5 percent per annum, to 1.88 million by 2011. Urban infrastructure\ndeficiencies are clearly evident in the outer areas\u2014only 32 percent of the outer population are\nconnected to a water system and 18 percent to a sewerage system, less than 50 percent of the\narea is covered by a drainage system, and under 70 percent of the area is served by solid\nwaste collection. Industrial wastes flow, largely untreated, into the surrounding environment,\nexposing the community to acids, toxic chemicals, paints, varnish, and other highly toxic\ncompounds.\n48. Because Calcutta\u2019s terrain is very flat, stormwater and sewage have to be pumped into\nreceiving waters. During the wet season, flooding is exacerbated by undersized drains, drains\nblocked  by  uncollected  solid  waste,  and  silted  canals.  The  frequent  flooding  increases\nexposure  to  pathogens  from  overflowing  septic  tanks,  flooded  garbage  heaps,  and  other\nsources, and is most severe in the low-lying slum areas.\n49. The population density, typical of slum settlements, remains a major public health\nconcern with regard to the transmission of communicable diseases, especially tuberculosis.\nAround 50 percent of the target population in the project area live in slum housing or worse;", "13\nthis represents around 700,000 people. About 26-30 percent of the slum dwelling households\nin the target area fall below the poverty line\u2014this is about 180,000-210,000 people, or 13-15\npercent of the total population in the project area.8 Low-income or slum settlements comprise\nregistered  bustees  (20  percent  of  the  target  population),  refugee  colonies  (2  percent),\nunregistered bustees and canal bank settlements (10 percent), and the homeless (1 percent).\nInadequate shelter compounds the poor environmental health conditions in the slum areas. Of\nthe total slum population in the project area, around 70 percent occupy a single room structure,\nand around 80 percent occupy dwellings of 36 square meters (m2) or less. Smoke from the\nburning of dung, wood fuel, coal, and kerosene inside slum dwellings predisposes occupants\nespecially young children and women, to acute respiratory infections (ARIs). Although CMC\u2019s\ndatabase on public health is very limited, it shows that mortality rates due to ARI and diarrhea\naccount for around 29 percent of all infant deaths.9\nB. Objectives and Scope\n50. The primary objective of the Project is human development, with environment as the\nsecondary objective. The specific objectives of the Project are to (i) improve the environmental\nconditions in the outer areas of Calcutta; (ii) reduce poverty in the low-income areas through\naffordable access to basic urban services; (iii) facilitate community empowerment through\nparticipatory processes; (iv) protect the environment from adverse developmental impacts; and\n(v) help CMC develop as a proficient and autonomous municipality. The Project covers the\nhighest priority investments under the Municipal Calcutta Environment Improvement Program,\nwhich is a long-term master plan prepared under ADB TA. The project area covers boroughs I,\nXI, XII, XIII, XIV, and XV (outer areas of Calcutta municipality) for parts B, D and E of the\nProject, with parts A, C and F covering all boroughs within the municipality (the project parts\nare described in detail below). The total population of the outer area is about 1.4 million people,\nwhereas the total population of Calcutta municipality is around 5.0 million. The number of\npeople expected to benefit directly from the Project ranges from 65,000 to 5.0 million across\nthe various components. The Project will support CMC in developing a sustainable urban\ngovernance  framework  in  accordance  with  the  intent  and  provisions  of  the  74th  CAA,  by\nestablishing frameworks and capacity building at the municipal level. It will also help improve\nthe environmental health conditions of the outer boroughs of Calcutta, including slum and low-\nincome areas. The Project has six parts. Appendix 5 provides a summary project description.\n1.  Part A:  Stakeholder Consultation Process\n51. The stakeholder consultation process (SCP) will promote stakeholder involvement in the\nProject and contribute to the effective implementation of the project investments. The SCP is\ndesigned to ensure stakeholder awareness, participation, and education with respect to the\nimplementation and management of the project facilities. It will also educate the communities\nabout environmental sanitation and health linkages. The project beneficiaries will be consulted\nabout project operations, as well as the implications to the community in terms of benefits and\nresponsibilities. Information about the stakeholders\u2019 needs and expectations under the Project\nwill flow to the project management teams. Using existing community networks where possible,\nstakeholders will be encouraged to become involved in the project design, implementation,\nO&M, and monitoring. As a cross-cutting component, the SCP will underpin the promotion of\n                                                \n8 The poverty line in India is defined as income necessary to buy food to meet a daily intake of 2,400 calories of\nenergy in rural areas (2,100 calories in urban areas), and certain basic nonfood items such as clothing and\ntransportation. In monetary terms, this is about Rs300 ($6.50) for urban areas.\n9 Based on a pilot area program \u2013 Calcutta Slum Improvement Project.", "14\naffordable access of the poor to basic urban services in low-income areas, and facilitate\ncommunity  empowerment  through  development  and  adoption  of  demand-led,  participatory\napproaches across all components. NGOs will be recruited under part F to manage the SCP,\ntogether with the supply of equipment, materials, and staff resources. The NGOs will work with\ncommunity-based organizations (CBOs) and other civil society organizations. The total number\nof beneficiaries is expected to be about 5.0 million.\n2. Part B:  Sewerage and Drainage Improvements\n52. This component will (i) optimize sewage collection, removal, and treatment; and (ii)\nreduce flooding through improved stormwater drainage. The component will cover the following\nfour areas of CMC: (i) Cossipore-Chitpur (part of borough I); (ii) Jadavpur (part of boroughs XI\nand XII); (iii) South Suburban (part of boroughs XI, XIII, and XIV); and (iv) Garden Reach (part\nof borough XV). All of these areas have inadequate sewerage and drainage systems. Although\nthese areas already have a number of sewers and drains constructed under the GAP, only a\nfew house connections exist. As a result, the GAP systems are grossly underused, and the\nlevels of coverage of the population are low. The Project therefore seeks to make effective use\nof the existing GAP infrastructure.\n53. The  Project  will  (i)  optimize  sewage  interception  and  collection  systems  providing\nsecondary sewers (450 km); (ii) build trunk sewers in addition to existing GAP trunk lines (50\nkm); (iii) develop separate stormwater drainage systems, including pumping stations, where\nappropriate;  (iv)  connect  properties  to  the  existing  and  newly  extended  networks;  (v)\nconstruct/rehabilitate  five  pumping/lift  stations;  (vi)  upgrade  three  treatment  plants  and\nconstruct two new treatment plants where necessary; and (vii) desilt and rehabilitate selected\noutfall canals. Based on a least-cost analysis, separate sewerage and drainage systems are\nproposed where feasible. Where existing infrastructure dictates, or where streets are narrow,\ncombined sewers are to be used. Where necessary, alternative engineering solutions such as\ninterceptor tanks and small bore sewers will be examined and used. The treatment process\nproposed is extended aeration. This type of treatment is recommended due to its simple\nrequirements  for  O&M,  sludge  digestion,  and  reduced  power  requirements.  In  addition,\nnumerous  reservoirs  and  water  bodies  in  the  CMC  area  need  urgent  attention,  as  their\nenvironmental degradation endangers public health. The exact location of the treatment plant\nand pumping station sites will be fixed during detailed design. At that time, all land acquisition\nmust comply with the agreed resettlement framework and the Bank\u2019s Resettlement Policy. The\nProject will provide for the rehabilitation of the Rabindra and Subhas lakes, both major water\nbodies in the CMC drainage area. The total number of beneficiaries is about 1.4 million people.\n3. Part C:  Solid Waste Management\n54. Part C will introduce improvements to the municipal, hazardous, and biomedical waste\nstreams.  For  municipal  wastes,  the  component  will  (i)  enhance  stakeholder  awareness,\nincluding informal education and training for trash sorters, (ii) extend door-to-door collection\nservices to cover the entire CMC area, and (iii) encourage waste generators to manage and\nsegregate recyclable and nonrecyclable wastes at source. To achieve these objectives, the\nProject will improve solid waste transportation by (i) replacing open containers with closed\ncontainers; (ii) optimizing container locations; (iii) phasing out open-back trucks, and replacing\nthem with compactor trucks; (iv) using bulldozers and other equipment necessary for efficient\nlandfill operations; (v) introducing mechanical road sweepers; and (vi) progressively phasing", "15\nout night soil tankers as the sewerage system is expanded. The total number of beneficiaries is\nexpected to be around 5.0 million.\n55. With regard to municipal waste, the component is based on segregation of waste at\nsource, effective collection of the various wastes, and disposal in an environmentally safe\nmanner.  With  support  from  the  SCP,  waste  will  be  segregated  at  source  into  recyclable\nmaterial (23 percent), biodegradable matter (58 percent), and inorganic waste (19 percent).\nThe recyclable material will be segregated by sources, collected and removed by NGOs, and\ntransported for sale to dealers, retailers, and wholesalers. The biodegradable matter will be\nsegregated by NGOs and transported to landfill sites where it will be composted and sold. The\nremaining inorganic waste material will be taken to the existing landfill sites, which will be\nupgraded to assimilate the waste in an environmentally safe manner. This approach to waste\nmanagement will considerably increase the time the existing landfill sites can be used. To\nsupplement the 700 tonnes per day composting plant at Dhapa, an additional plant is proposed\nat the same site to handle 1,150 tonnes per day.\n56. With regard to hazardous waste, dedicated transport vehicles will be provided, and an\nintegrated hazardous waste management facility developed at the Dhapa landfill site. The\nfacilities will be equipped with adequate leachate collection and treatment.\n57. The  major  elements  of  the  biomedical  waste  management  strategy  are  improved\nhandling and transport of the waste, and cost-effective treatment and disposal. The Project will\nfinance  dedicated  transport  vehicles  and  a  central  biomedical  waste  treatment  facility.\nBiomedical wastes will be incinerated at the central biomedical waste treatment facility at the\nDhapa landfill. The larger generators of biomedical waste will separate biomedical waste for\nrecycling  and  incineration  at  source;  this  will  be  achieved  through  extensive  stakeholder\nawareness  programs.  Nonplastic  biomedical  wastes  will  be  incinerated  at  Dhapa.  For\ngenerators of large volumes of plastic biomedical wastes, assistance will be provided to shred\nand disinfect the waste.\n4. Part D:  Slum Improvements\n58. Part D will address the environmental conditions of informal and formal low-income\nsettlements. The Project will improve environmental services in these settlements including\nwater supply, drainage, and sanitation. For settlements not yet recognized by CMC, the Project\nwill support recognition through zoning, site planning, and registration of dwelling units, as well\nas  physical  investments.    The  component  will  address  the  immediate  needs  of  the  poor\nthrough a crisis management approach, and also through longer-term improvements.\n59. A crisis management approach will be adopted to address the immediate needs for\nwater supply and sanitation in unrecognized low-income settlements. Up to 65,000 slum-\ndwellers will benefit from targeted settlements in Cossipore, Garden Reach, and Jadavpur.\nCivil works proposed include (i) provision of water standposts (9,350 units); (ii) construction\nand/or  conversion  of  sanitary  latrines  (4,200  units);  (iii)  construction  and/or  renovation  of\ncommunity latrines (910 units); and (iv) construction of washing/bathing platforms (430 units).\n60. Longer-term improvements will include a wide range of amenities to improve the\nliving  conditions  of  slum  dwellers.  The  same  rights  and  responsibilities  that  have  been\nconveyed by CMC to registered bustee dwellers will accrue to the unrecognized slum dwellers.\nThis will be achieved through a pilot scheme to establish land titles, registration of dwellings,\nrecognition of", "16\ntenancy rights, rent control, and municipal tax liability. Security of tenure will enhance the\ncreditworthiness  of  the  tenants  and  improve  their  access  to  financing  for  physical\nimprovements. A small-scale loan facility of $60,000 will be established to finance physical\nimprovement of slum dwellings on a pilot basis. Civil works proposed include (i) widening and\nrealignment of neighborhood access lanes (1,490 meters [m]); (ii) electric lighting to illuminate\nlanes and open public spaces (40 poles and wiring); (iii) widening, realignment, and lining of\ndrains (595 m); (iv) construction of sewer/drainage lines (380 m); (v) construction of water\nsupply lines (785 m); (vii) provision of solid waste containers (6 units); and (viii) improvements\nto public open space (3,182 m2). An estimated 190,000 people will benefit from improved\nfacilities under this component.\n61. NGOs will be mobilized to design and manage the program. The NGOs will facilitate\nconsultation,  community  mobilization,  participation  in  prioritizing  community  requirements,\nplanning  and  scheduling  of  civil  works,  management  of  the  small-scale  loan  facility,  and\nmaintenance. The NGOs will work with CBOs and other civil society organizations.\n5. Part E:  Canal Improvements\n62. Under part E, about 53 km of canals will be improved. These canals, which are the\nmajor outfalls for the sewerage and drainage systems under part B, are almost completely\nsilted up and are very polluted. They will be dredged and desilted. Lining will be undertaken to\nimprove  hydraulic  efficiency  in  some  areas,  and  culverts  and  bridges  will  be\nreplaced/upgraded,  as  appropriate,  to  eliminate  drainage  constrictions.  Existing  pumping\nstations will be rehabilitated and augmented and new pumping stations will be constructed to\nensure uninterrupted flow, particularly during heavy rainfall and high tide levels in the Ganges\nRiver. The canals to be improved include the Tollygunge-Panchannangram Main Channel with\nits intercepting and branch channels, the Keorapukur Canal and its tributaries, the Begore\nCanal, the Manikhali Canal, and the Churial Canal. The sediment material, from dredging the\ncanals and desilting the sewers and drains will be screened for a wide range of contaminants.\nContaminated sediment will be transported to a secure landfill site at Dhapa. Uncontaminated\nsediment may be used as construction fill material.\n63. Improvement of the canals will require the resettling about 11,000 people living on the\ncanal  banks.  Dwellings  and  privies  on  canal  banks  constrict  canal  flows,  leading  to  the\naccumulation of silt and vegetation, and prevent regular cleaning and maintenance. Because\nthe canals need to be dredged and desilted regularly, some of the current encroachers must be\npermanently relocated. The Project will examine ways of involving canal bank dwellers in the\nlong-term management and maintenance of the canals wherever possible. The resettlement\nwill be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995)  and\nguidelines outlined in the Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice (1998).\n6. Part F:  Implementation Assistance and Capacity Building\n64. CMC  has  substantial  experience  in  municipal  management.  However,  constrained\ninvestment levels in the past have not permitted its staff to gain experience implementing big\nprojects, although they have implemented many small- to medium-sized projects. The Project\nwill  supplement  CMC\u2019s  resources  with  project  management  consultants,  comprising\ninternational and domestic experts. The consultants will also provide specific support to the", "17\nIrrigation and Waterways Department (IWD), although this will be limited, because IWD has\nsubstantial experience in canal development and rehabilitation.\n65. A team of domestic consultants will carry out the geodetic survey and detailed design\nand construction supervision. For the sewerage and drainage component, in-depth appreciation\nof the dynamics of the complex systems is required before detailed design can proceed. A\ndynamic flood study of the sewerage and drainage system will therefore be included as part of\nthe detailed design consulting services package.\n66. A local NGO will be engaged to manage the SCP. The NGO will be experienced in\nworking  with  government  agencies  and  communities  in  planning  and  implementing\nenvironmental and slum improvements projects, and preferably will have had experience with\nresettlement. The NGO will facilitate the implementation of the resettlement programs for CMC\nand IWD. To ensure the public is fully aware of the Project and its implications for civil society in\ngeneral, a public relations agency will be recruited to provide professional media management\nfor the Project.\n67. Due  to  a  lack  of  funding,  CMC\u2019s  staff  have  not  been  able  to  develop  CMC\u2019s\nmanagement systems and skills to a level commensurate with the largest municipality in India.\nIn addition, CMC has not yet developed the community consultation skills or participatory\nsystems  to  adequately  meet  the  needs  of  civil  society.  A  capacity  building  program  will\ntherefore  be  implemented,  and  consulting  services  (international  and  domestic)  will  be\nengaged to deliver the program (para. 82) The capacity building program will be funded by\nDFID under a parallel financing arrangement, and administered by ADB.\n68. Part F will provide a substantial and fully equipped office for CMC and its consultants for\ntheir project activities. An office of a more modest nature will be necessary for IWD, for the canal\nrehabilitation component. Part F will provide vehicles and minor equipment for the Project, and\nincremental  administration  costs  associated  with  the  Project,  logistics,  training,  and  other\nsupport.\nC. Technical Justification\n69. The TA conducted a comprehensive evaluation of combined and separate sewerage\nsystems, based on considerations such as (i) existing sewerage and drainage systems, (ii)\nadequacy of road width for laying new sewers/drains, (iii) degree and type of present and\nfuture  urban  development,  (iv)  location  of  major  drains  and  outfall  canals,  and  (v)  land\navailability for treatment plants and pumping stations. The comparison of the cost-effectiveness\nof alternative designs indicated that the best approach generally would use separate sewerage\nand drainage systems, but that combined sewers may be the most suitable option in some\ncases. Partly combined systems were found to be unsatisfactory. The Project will include the\nconstruction  of  sewage  treatment  plants,  which  will  use  the  extended  aeration  treatment\nprocess  in  preference  to  the  activated  sludge  process  model.  Extended  aeration  is\nrecommended  due  to  its  simple  requirements  for  O&M,  sludge  digestion,  lower  power\nrequirements, and easier laboratory control. The Project will require the treatment process at\nthe South Suburban East sewage treatment plants to be changed to aerated lagoons, as the\ncurrent anaerobic process is not consistent with Government guidelines, 1993.", "18\nD. Cost Estimates\n70. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $360 million equivalent including duties and\ntaxes. Of the total cost, $103.7 million (29 percent), is the foreign exchange cost, including $38.1\nmillion in capitalized interest, and $256.3 million equivalent (71 percent) is the local currency\ncost. DFID is providing a further $30 million for a comprehensive capacity building program for\nCMC to support the project investments. Table 1 summarizes the cost estimates. Detailed cost\nestimates are provided in Appendix 6.\nTable 1: Summary of Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nItem Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost\nA.

Financing Plan\n71. The Government requested that ADB provide a loan of $250.0 million from its ordinary\ncapital resources, representing approximately 69 percent of the total project costs. The loan will\nbe for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 6 years, and with interest to be determined\nin accordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate for US dollar loans. The loan of\n$250.0 million is proposed to finance $103.7 million of the foreign exchange cost and $146.3\nmillion equivalent of local currency costs. The local cost financing is proposed to cover part of\nthe costs relating to civil works, equipment, consulting services, and resettlement, but excluding\nall  land  and  duties  and  taxes.  The  foreign  exchange  risk  will  be  borne  by  the  central\nGovernment. Table 2 summarizes the proposed financing plan.", "19\nTable 2: Proposed Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total Percent\nExchange Currency Cost\nAsian Development Bank 103.7 146.3 250.0 69\nState Government 0.0 54.6 54.6 15\nCMC 0.0 55.4 55.4 16\nTotala 103.7 256.3 360.0 100\na  Includes duties and taxes estimated at $15.5 million.\n72. The Borrower will be the Government of India. The loan to the Government will be\npassed to the government of West Bengal as 70 percent debt and 30 percent grant. This will\nresult in a subsidiary loan of $175 million at an on-lending rate of 13 percent per annum for a\nperiod of 25 years, including a 6 year grace period. The remaining $75 million will be provided\nas a grant.\n73. The government of West Bengal will on-lend the full amount of the loan to CMC on the\nsame terms. The $75 million Government grant will be passed on to CMC also as a grant. In\naddition, the government of West Bengal will provide further budgetary support of $54.6 million,\nof  which  $27.3  million  will  be  allocated  to  IWD  as  a  grant  to  meet  the  cost  of  canal\nimprovements and resettlement, and $27.3 million allocated as a grant to CMC. CMC will meet\nthe balance of the project costs of $55.4 million. The sewerage connections will be financed\nunder the Project, and CMC will recover the cost (estimated at $30 million) from customers\nover  a  2-3  year  period  in  accordance  with  affordability  levels.  Under  a  parallel  financing\nagreement with CMC, DFID will provide grant funding ($30 million equivalent) to support the\ncomprehensive capacity building program required to sustain the project investments.\n74. Provision  for  financing  local  currency  costs  is  justified  under  ADB\u2019s  local  currency\nfinancing policy. Because of the constraints imposed on national savings by the low per capita\nincome, assistance is required to support the local currency costs of development projects.\nFurthermore, public finances remain under severe pressure. A significant domestic resource gap\nwill persist for some time. Based on these considerations and the overall lack of domestic\nbudgetary resources in the sector, and given the relatively high local currency cost in a project of\nthis nature, ADB assistance for local currency expenditures related to the Project is justified.\nADB financing of local currency costs represents 59 percent of the total loan, 57 percent of the\ntotal local currency cost, and 41 percent of the total project cost.\nF. Executing Agencies\n75. The Project will have two executing agencies (EAs). CMC will be the principal EA,\nresponsible for parts A, B, C, D, and F. IWD of the government of West Bengal will be the EA\nfor part E. Although part A will be essentially under the responsibility of CMC, it will also\nprovide services to IWD on the resettlement aspects of the canal improvements component.\nPart  F  will  provide  support  to  IWD  in  terms  of  consulting  services  and  incremental\nadministration. CMC is very experienced with its routine municipal functions, but not with large\nprojects. Similarly, IWD is very experienced in the development and maintenance of canals\nand waterways, and is well equipped to manage the design of the proposed dredging and", "20\ndesilting of the canals. However, project management experience is limited. Therefore, CMC,\nand to a lesser extent IWD, will be supported in project management.\nG. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Project Organization and Management\n76. A steering committee will be established to generally oversee the implementation of the\nProject, provide guidance on policy and institutional reforms, ensure provision of counterpart\nfunding, and ensure that the overall objectives of the Project are achieved. The steering\ncommittee will be chaired by the minister of municipal affairs and urban development of the\ngovernment of West Bengal. The deputy chairman will be the mayor of Calcutta, and the\nmunicipal commissioner will be the secretary. The steering committee members will include the\nsecretaries of IWD, municipal affairs and urban development, finance, land and land reforms,\nthe chairman of West Bengal pollution control board, the chief executive officer of CMDA, the\nmembers  of  mayor-in-council  for  water  supply  and  sewerage,  and  the  chairmen  of  the\nboroughs within the project area.  The steering committee will meet quarterly, or as required.\n77. A project management unit (PMU) will be established in both CMC and IWD. The PMU\nin CMC will be headed by a project director, with joint commissioner rank. The PMU in IWD will\nbe headed by a project director, with chief engineer rank. The PMUs will be responsible for the\noverall management of the Project, including recruitment of consultants, procurement, project\naccounting,  land  acquisition,  monitoring  of  resettlement,  stakeholder  consultation,  slum\ndevelopment, review and approval of detailed designs, review and approval of contract awards,\nimplementation of the physical works, quality assurance, and monitoring of the institutional and\npolicy reforms. The PMUs will provide the coordination points for CMC, CMDA, the government\nof  West  Bengal,  IWD,  and  all  consultants.  Both  PMUs  will  be  staffed  with  qualified,\nexperienced, and computer-literate personnel in the fields of project management, accounting,\nengineering, and procurement. The key PMU personnel, will be sourced from line departments\nin  CMC  and  IWD,  will  be  assigned  for  the  entire  project  duration,  and  ultimately  will  be\nincorporated  into  the  organizational  structure  responsible  for  the  assets  and  systems\nimplemented under the Project. Both PMUs will be assisted in their work by the associated line\ndepartments, the PMC, and the design and construction supervision consultants. The slum\nimprovements  component  will  be  implemented  with  support  from  NGOs  and  CBOs  and\nborough, and ward-level committees using the SCP.\n2. Implementation Schedule\n78. The  Project  is  to  be  implemented  over  a  six-year  period,  with  consulting  services\ncommencing by mid-2001 and civil works construction starting in 2003. Completion is scheduled\nby mid-2007. The project implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 7.\n3. Procurement\n79. Goods and services to be financed by ADB will be procured in accordance with ADB's\nGuidelines for Procurement. Contracts for major civil works in excess of $3 million will follow\ninternational competitive bidding procedures. Smaller civil works packages will be done through\nlocal competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. The PMU will produce an updated\nprocurement plan, detailing the proposed procurement for the next financial year, and", "21\nsubmit it to ADB by 31 May, annually. Indicative procurement packaging is shown in Appendix\n8.\n80. Utility  vehicles  and  equipment  for  packages  less  than  $0.5  million  in  value  will  be\nprocured following international shopping procedures. Minor items such as office equipment and\nconsumables (valued at less than $100,000) may be procured by direct purchase according to\nthe Government's standard procedures acceptable to ADB.\n4. Consulting Services\n81. A team of international and domestic project management consultants will assist the\nPMUs to implement, manage, and monitor project activities. A total of 330 person-months of\nconsulting  services  is  required  (108  international  and  222  domestic).  A  team  of  domestic\nconsultants for a total of 1,610 person-months is required for detailed engineering design and\nconstruction supervision. About 810 person-months of services from NGOs will be required to\nmanage the stakeholder consultation process and resettlement operation. A public relations\nagency will be recruited to provide professional media management for the Project. All the\nconsulting services will be financed under the ADB loan. The consultants will be selected and\nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other\narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants.\n5. Capacity Building Program\n82. A comprehensive capacity building program (CBP) to strengthen all aspects of CMC will\nbe funded through a parallel financing arrangement between DFID and CMC. The CBP will be\nan integral part of the Project, and will come within the operational responsibility of the PMU.\nThe CBP is designed to help CMC meet its obligations under the loan covenants. Selection\nand recruitment of consultants and procurement of all equipment and materials for the CBP will\nbe in accordance with DFID\u2019s policies and guidelines. The CBP, which has 10 packages, will\nbe managed and coordinated through a CBP manager who will be responsible to the PMU.\nOverall administration of the CBP will be undertaken by ADB as part of the routine loan review\nmissions. The CBP manager is provided for as one of the packages of the CBP. A total of\n1,788 person-months (356 international, 1,432 domestic) is to be provided for the CBP. The CBP\nwill (i) develop and implement an institutional and organizational plan; (ii) computerize CMC\u2019s\noperations; (iii) develop and implement a geographic information system; (iv) develop and\nimplement  an  integrated  financial  MIS;  (v)  develop  and  implement  an  integrated  asset\nmanagement system; (vi) develop and implement a composite area-linked system for the levy\nof property taxes; (vii) develop and implement a preventive O&M program, with particular\nemphasis on health and safety, and effluent monitoring; (viii) develop and adopt urban poverty\nreduction approaches within the Bustee Services Cell; (ix) develop and implement a human\nresources development program; and (x) establish the CBP manager. Package (viii) will also\ndevelop a policy on involuntary resettlement for the government of West Bengal, including\nimplementation guidelines and capacity building for its implementation. DFID are currently\nconsidering  expanding  the  scope  of  the  CBP,  before  formalizing  agreement  with  the\nGovernment. The agreement is linked to the Project through a cross-effectivity clause.\n6. Disbursement and Imprest Fund Account\n83. The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement\nHandbook. To expedite implementation of the Project through the timely release of funds, an", "22\nimprest account may be established for each of EA for the exclusive use of the Project. Imprest\naccounts  will  be  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan\nDisbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed to by the Borrower and ADB. The\ninitial  amount  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  will  be  determined  by  the  Bank  in\nconsultation with the Borrower. The statement of expenditures procedures may be used for\nreimbursement and liquidation of the imprest account for eligible expenditures up to a maximum\nof $50,000 per expenditure.\n7. Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n84. For the sewerage and drainage component, the project proposals will require about 220\nhectares (ha) of land. Approximately 180 ha are required for SWM, but this land is available at\nthe  Dhapa  landfill  site.  The  remaining  40  ha  is  required  for  the  sewerage  and  drainage\ncomponent. The exact locations of land requirements could not be identified during project\npreparation, although land areas and approximate locations are known. A detailed description\nof  land  acquisition  procedures  is  in  Appendix  9.  The  procedures  for  land  acquisition  will\ncommence  immediately  following  the  system  operational  analysis  in  the  early  stages  of\ndetailed design. Compulsory land acquisition will be undertaken either on application by CMC\nto the state government under the 1980 CMC Act and the 1894 Land Acquisition Act, or by the\nstate government of its own accord under the 1894 Land Acquisition Act. Adequate time for\nland  acquisition  is  provided  for  in  the  implementation  schedule.  Should  involuntary\nresettlement  be  involved,  a  resettlement  plan  must  be  prepared  and  implemented  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s policy and guidelines.\n85. Some of the illegal settlers along the banks of the canals to be rehabilitated under the\nproject must be resettled. It is expected that about 3,600 households (about 11,000 people)\nhave to be moved. Resettlement will be undertaken in accordance with a resettlement plan that\nhas been prepared and approved by ADB; a summary resettlement plan is presented in\nAppendix 10. The resettlement plan will be implemented by the government of West Bengal\nand CMC.\n8. Stakeholder Consultation Process\n86. During  project  formulation,  stakeholder  participation  was  ensured  through  open\nworkshops  and  consultations  with  beneficiary  groups  and  elected  civic  leaders.  Although\nsummarized as a discrete component under the Project, the SCP will be integrated throughout\nall components. Stakeholders will be continuously consulted during project implementation and\nmaintenance of the completed facilities, to ensure their interests have been addressed and to\nbring about their greater \"ownership\" of the facilities and cost recovery measures. Existing\nstakeholder networks will be used in the delivery of the process, and will serve as a conduit for\nthe Project. The SCP is designed to involve all stakeholders in the decision-making processes\nof planning and implementing of the Project. The SCP will also cover community awareness,\nparticipation, and environmental health education. NGOs will be recruited to manage the SCP.\nThe NGOs will be responsible to CMC and IWD, through the PMUs.\n9.  Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n87. The project directors will be responsible for providing ADB and the steering committee\nwith quarterly progress reports on project implementation. The reports will be prepared by the\nPMU, based on data collected from the EAs. The reports will particularly address the", "23\ninstitutional and policy development aspects of the Project. They will provide a description of\nprogress, details of any modifications required to project schedule, problems encountered,\nand  institutional  and  policy  development  aspects  of  the  Project.    They  will  provide  a\ndescription of progress, details of any modifications required to the project schedule, problems\nencountered,and  an outline of the work in the ensuing quarter. The reports will also provide\nsummary financial accounts of the Project, consisting of expenditure during the quarter, year-\nto-date expenditure, and expenditure to date. The EAs will also submit to ADB within three\nmonths of substantial physical completion of Project, a completion report that will cover the\ndetails of implementation, costs, benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME) activities, and other\ninformation reasonably requested by ADB.\n88. The PMUs will establish and maintain accounts and records to facilitate identification of\nincome  and  expenditures  related  to  the  Project,  and  will  do  this  by  the  approval  date  of\nprequalification  documents  for  civil  works.  The  PMUs  will  contain  an  adequate  number  of\nsuitably qualified accounting staff. All the accounts and statements of expenditure and revenues\nwill  be  audited  annually  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Audited  financial  statements  and\nsubproject accounts, together with the report of the auditor, will be submitted within 12 months of\nthe close of the financial year. The  responsibility  for  preparing  all  reports,  accounts,  and\nstatements, and ensuring that they are submitted in accordance with the agreed time frame,\nwill rest with the project director.\n10. Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n89. To ensure that project facilities are managed efficiently and that the benefits reach the\ntarget groups, a BME program is included under the Project.10 This program will monitor the\ndelivery of services anticipated and measure benefits as they accrue. To measure the health\nand social benefits resulting from the Project, the PMU will carry out periodic surveys to\ndetermine  the  changes  in  key  social  indicators  over  time,  including  health,  welfare,  and\neconomic and physical conditions. The indicators to be monitored have been formulated and\nagreed  upon.  These  include  indicators  pertaining  to  environmental  improvements,  public\nhealth, changes in property values, poverty and community development, and operational\nefficiency of the Project. The PMU will submit a detailed implementation plan for BME and for\npreparing benchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence within six months of loan\neffectiveness. The PMU will be assisted by the detailed design and construction supervision\nconsultants in carrying out this monitoring.  The findings of periodic monitoring will be used to\nadjust  the  scope  of  project  improvements,  particularly  for  the  slum  and  community\ndevelopment components.\n11. Mid-term Review\n90. A  comprehensive  midterm  review,  with  participation  of  senior  central  and  state\ngovernment officials and ADB staff, will be carried out after the Project has reached the\nimplementation stage, at which time detailed design is expected to be complete and major\ncontracts will have been awarded and commenced. This is envisaged to be about 24 months\nafter  loan  effectiveness.  The  reviewers  will  critically  evaluate  actual  project  progress,\nimplementation procedures, procurement methodology, BME activities, and the performance of\nconsultants.  Following  the  review,  corrective  measures  will  be  introduced  to  remedy  any\nidentified weaknesses.\n                                                \n10BME will be undertaken within the framework of ADB\u2019s project performance monitoring system, which is currently\nbeing pilot tested.", "24\nH. Environmental and Social Measures\n91. By reducing pollutants discharged, the Project will improve the quality of receiving\nwaters. A summary initial environmental examination report is attached as Appendix 11. An\nexpanded environmental examination has been prepared, and is available for review. The\nrehabilitation and expansion of sewers and drains will help improve public health and the\nquality of life of communities in the project area, and will help improve and protect the quality of\ngroundwater, which is currently being contaminated. The construction of sewage treatment\nplants  will  reduce  the  load  of  heavy  metals,  organic  chemicals,  and  other  potential\ncontaminants added to the city\u2019s urban environment. The livelihood of over 20,000 people\ndepends on the nutrients in the effluent flows to produce crops and fish. Reduced levels of\npollutants in the city\u2019s effluent discharges will (i) reduce the potential adverse health impacts\nresulting from the irrigation of crops and the farming of fish in the East Calcutta Wetlands, and\n(ii) preserve the unique biological values of the wetlands. Rehabilitating the outfall canals in\nCalcutta will reduce the potential for flooding in the city and enhance the quality of life of\nindividuals  currently  residing  in  areas  subject  to  inundation.  An  environmental  impact\nassessment (EIA) will be carried out for all project facilities during the initial stages of detailed\ndesign, and upon identification of all land sites, before any construction commences. The EIAs\nwill  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  Bank\u2019s  Environmental Guidelines  and  the\nrequirements of the Borrower and the government of West Bengal.\n92. Improved SWM will reduce the adverse health impacts on people associated with\nunsanitary SWM practices, and will reduce health problems caused by disease vectors. In\naddition, improved landfill operations will reduce the potential for surface and groundwater\ncontamination at the Dhapa site in the East Calcutta Wetlands, and the adverse biological\nimpacts at the site. Improving the management of biomedical wastes will help protect the\ncommunity from infectious and injurious wastes. Improved hazardous waste management will\nsubstantially reduce the discharge of contaminants into the environment. The eventual closure\nof the landfill sites at Dhapa and Noapara (in 2012) will affect the livelihood of trash sorters,\nmost of whom are women and children. CMC has prepared a rehabilitation framework, and will\nprepare a detailed rehabilitation plan and census during project implementation. Under the\nProject, immediate measures will be taken to ensure safer and more hygienic conditions of\nwork for the sorters, including the provision of protective clothing and health checks.\n93. A social analysis has been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines (Appendix\n12). The Project has been prepared on the basis of a participatory approach using stakeholder\nconsultations, socioeconomic surveys, and workshops. The Project is thus responsive to the\nneeds and preferences of the stakeholders, and will have no adverse social impacts. Social\nmeasures incorporated into the Project are designed to ensure that no population groups are\ndisadvantaged, that there is equitable accessibility to municipal services, and that the services\nare affordable to the poorer groups. To ensure that the consultative process is maintained, the\nproject design includes a stakeholder consultation process.\n94. To ensure access to the Project for all income groups, financing support schemes will\nbe available to all households regardless of income. For sewerage connections, a deferred\npayment scheme will be implemented under which CMC will finance the connection into the\nsewerage system and the households will repay CMC through the consolidated rate charge\nsystem. Similarly, a small-scale loan facility will be established through which slum dwellers\ncan improve their housing structures. Discounts will be offered to those able to repay quickly to\nreduce the revolution time of the fund, thus making it available to a wider group of people.", "25\nNGOs will manage the fund under the SCP. The monthly fee for sewerage and drainage will be\nmaintained at 1.8 percent of monthly household income for the poorer groups, which will permit\nthe total cost for water supply and sanitation services to remain below the universally accepted\nguideline of 5-6 percent of household income.\n95. A detailed resettlement plan, approved by ADB, has been prepared for the settlers\nalong the canal banks who will be relocated in a socially responsible way. The resettlement\nplan also addresses the particular needs of the socially disadvantaged trash sorters, who will\nlose  their  means  of  income  as  the  landfill  sites  gradually  become  more  sanitary.  The\nresettlement plan also includes an approved resettlement framework, which will be followed for\nthe preparation of further resettlement plans if future land acquisition under the Project involves\nresettlement. Where resettlement is involved, relocation will be undertaken in strict accordance\nwith the ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), thus ensuring that no population group\nis disadvantaged as a result of project implementation.\nI. Impact on Poverty\n96. An estimated 200,000 people live below the poverty line in the project area. The SCP\nand  the  CBP  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  the  poor  groups  through  the  development  of\nmechanisms and approaches to the design and operation of projects, which will specifically\nmake  provision  for  the  underprivileged.  In  addition,  the  SCP  will  empower  communities,\nenabling them to participate more actively and constructively in all civic matters. Up to 5.0\nmillion  people  will  benefit  from  the  Project,  of  which  some  50  percent  reside  in  slum\nsettlements. Under the CBP, skills will be developed in the CMC, NGOs, and CBOs to ensure\nthe effective delivery of such approaches, and systems will be institutionalized under the\nProject. This approach will also empower civil society in general. Extending access to the\nsewerage system and ensuring better SWM for the poor will enhance their health. The project\ninterventions  in  the  slum  communities  will  address  poverty  in  two  ways.  First,  the  slum\ncommunities will have greater access to basic facilities such as water supply and sanitation.\nSecond, the standard of shelter in the slums is expected to improve, as the communities will be\noffered financial assistance to rehabilitate their homes, where appropriate.\n97. The canal bank dwellers who are relocated under the canal rehabilitation works will\nhave improved quality of life through the provisions of the ADB-approved resettlement plan.\nThe government of West Bengal and CMC have recognized this exercise as an opportunity to\nassist  the  canal  bank  dwellers  to  improve  their  standard  of  living.  The  resettlement  plan\nensures a minimum standard of housing for relocation, and addresses the special needs of\nvulnerable groups such as children and female household heads through specially designed\nrehabilitation programs.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n98. The Project will improve the urban environment and enhance human capital, which will\nlead to improved health and increased productivity, particularly among the slum dwellers. In the\nlonger-term,  improved  health  will,  in  turn,  contribute  to  better  educational  standards  and\neconomic growth. The SCP will underpin the sustainability of the Project through improved\nrepresentation. In addition, the SCP will empower communities, enabling them to participate", "26\nmore actively and constructively on all civic matters. Up to 5.0 million people will benefit from\nthe Project, of which some 50 percent reside in slum settlements.\n99. Accessibility by the poor and underprivileged to basic services and improved shelter in\nthe slum settlements will help them enter the mainstream of society. This will alleviate their\npersonal burden and will provide considerable benefit to the people of Calcutta as a whole.\nSome 65,000 slum dwellers will benefit from direct slum intervention under the Project. Many\nmore  will  benefit  indirectly  from  improved  municipal  services,  and  improved  employment\nopportunities generated by the considerable labor requirement for the construction work.\nA.  Economic and Financial Evaluation\n1. Economic Analysis\n100. The Project will improve the living and environmental conditions in the CMC area. The\nsewerage, drainage and canal components (parts B and E) will benefit approximately 1.4\nmillion  people  of  the  outer  areas  of  Calcutta.  The  SCP,  SWM  and  capacity  building\ncomponents (parts A, C, and F) will benefit all of CMC, with an estimated population of 5.0\nmillion. The slum improvements component (part D) will benefit 190,000 people. The economic\ncapital costs and incremental O&M costs of all components have been considered. Per capita\nvalues for each economic benefit have been calculated and multiplied by the target population\nin each case.\n101. The main economic benefit of the Project is improved human health. The Project will\nreduce  waterborne  and  water-related  diseases  due  to  reduced  flooding,  installation  of\nsewerage systems, and improved SWM. Cost savings will include reduced (i) hospital and\nhealth care; government expenditure on (ii) household medical expenditure; and (iii) expenses\nfor cleaning septic tanks; removing solid waste dumped into the canals; and repairing roads,\nvehicles, and dwellings due to flood damage. Reduced flooding also will save time in travelling\nto work, and benefits will be obtained from recycling and composting solid waste. Benefits\narising from the Project that are difficult to value will also have a positive impact on the\npopulation of Calcutta. These benefits include increases in land values, reduction of flood\nimpacts on economic activities, benefits to people resident outside the CMC area, benefits to\nvisitors, and the psychological benefits of reduction in morbidity and mortality.\n102. An integral economic analysis has been made for the Project as a whole, excluding\ncomponent A. The economic analysis is presented in detail in Appendix 13. The aggregate\neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) obtained for the Project is 14.5 percent, which is higher\nthan the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent. The economic net present value of\nthe Project has been calculated for discount rates of 10 and 12 percent. In both cases, it is\npositive. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the EIRR is most sensitive to delays in\nthe realization of benefits. However, the EIRR remains above 12 percent in all sensitivity\nanalyses.\n2. Financial Sustainability\na.  Current Financial Practices and Position of CMC\n103. A financial analysis is presented in Appendix 13. While CMC follows generally accepted\naccounting principles, because CMC lacks computerized accounting systems, it relies on cash-", "27\nbased financial reporting rather than accrual accounting procedures. This system has a limited\nability to track and manage receivables and payables, and CMC urgently needs to implement a\nfull accrual based accounting system. All CMC revenues are credited to the municipal fund.\nThe CMC Act, 1980, requires that the municipal fund be maintained in five accounts covering a\nrange  of  urban  services  which,  as  yet,  excludes  SWM.  A  separate  account  for  SWM  is\nessential if this activity is to be operated on corporate principles.\n104. CMC\u2019s operations are funded by state government transfers and locally generated\nrevenue. Historically, the state transfers have included a cost-of-living allowance, octroi motor\nvehicles  tax,  entertainment  tax,  grants  for  water  supply  and  sewerage  operations  (on  a\nmatching grant basis), bustee services (on a matching grant basis), development grants, and\nproject-specific grants. The most important transfers are the cost-of- living adjustments; and\nthe  development  grant,  which  is  paid  in  lieu  of  the  abolished  octroi.  For  FY2000,  these\ntransfers represented 89 percent of the total state transfers.\n105. Records show that the state was not always able to transfer the required amount. This,\ntogether with inadequate financial management, resulted in CMC running operating deficits of\n33-48 percent between 1993 and 1998. Following the abolition of the octroi, and motor vehicle\ntax, and the adoption of the State Finance Commission\u2019s recommendations (1995) in the\nbudget for FY2000, the state transfers have been rationalized, and include (i) allocation of 16\npercent of sales tax to local bodies as untied funds (CMC to receive 3.9 percent), (ii) cost-of-\nliving allowance to cover 100 percent of CMC\u2019s liability, (iii) all state taxes on entertainment to\nbe handed over to the local bodies, (iv) CMC empowered to issue trade licenses, and (v) CMC\nmay  impose  higher  tolls  on  heavy  vehicles  (still  under  consideration).  The  provision  of\nmatching grants for water supply, sewerage, and bustees will likely cease.\n106. CMC generates its local revenue through a mix of direct user charges, rents or leases,\nand taxes. For water supply, user charges are applied to water consumers having a connection\nof 20 mm or greater; for sewerage, charges are applied to ICI users; and for SWM, charges are\nalso applied to ICI establishments. Rents are received from the leasing of markets and, more\nrecently, payments are being received from some build-own-transfer schemes. There are a\nvariety of taxes, but by far the most significant is the consolidated rate charge, which accounts\nfor some 26-36 percent of total revenue; the sum of all taxes amounts to about 37-42 percent\nof total revenue. However, the locally generated revenues only recover around 20 percent of\nwater supply services, 3-7 percent of sewerage and drainage, and almost nothing for SWM. In\ntotal in FY2000, user fees for water supply, sewerage, and SWM represented only 9 percent of\nestimated revenues.\n107. Since FY1995, recurrent expenses for water supply have been in the range of 9-15\npercent of total expenditure, 7-10 percent for sewerage and drainage, 17-22 percent for SWM,\nand 3-17 percent for bustee services. Locally generated revenues are providing an increasing\nshare of total revenues, but this is because the state transfers have been decreasing in\nabsolute terms. Since FY1994, internally generated revenue has risen from 52 to 60 percent of\ntotal revenue. It is becoming increasingly necessary for CMC to reduce its dependence on\nstate transfers to bring about a real improvement in Calcutta\u2019s urban environment.\n108. Although the general ledger and trial balance (cash) are computerized, most other\naccounting functions are manual. The CMC Act, 1980, provides for audit of CMC\u2019s accounts,\nbut does not set any time limit for the preparation of financial accounts by CMC, for completion\nof the audit. The delayed preparation and audit of accounts means that proper financial", "28\ninformation is not available on a timely basis. This is of some concern, as CMC has substantial\narrears. The audit of the accounts for FY1991 has only just been completed by a private firm\non behalf of CMC. CMC advised ADB that this will now allow the completion of the accounts for\nthe following fiscal year (FY1992) and their subsequent audit, and so on. Due to the lack of up-\nto-date financial data, CMC\u2019s annual budgetary statements of receipts and expenses (both\ncapital and operational) must be relied upon when reviewing past financial performance. CMC\ndoes,  however,  provide  unaudited  copies  of  its  income  statement  (cash  basis,  excluding\ndepreciation) within 12 months of the end of the fiscal year to the examiner of local fund\naccounts, government of West Bengal.\n109. Computerized information of receipts and expenditures for the last three financial years\nis available, whereas prior to FY1996, only estimates are available. A review of CMC\u2019s past\nfinancial performance for these three years (actuals) of computerized data shows that in\nFY1997 (year ending 31 March 1997) and FY1998, CMC achieved a cash surplus from its\noperations of $4.4 million equivalent and $2.3 million equivalent, respectively. In FY1999 an\noperating deficit of $12.7 million equivalent was incurred, which was met from additional State\ntransfers. This is less than the projected budgeted deficit of $14.7 million equivalent, but is\nsubstantially different to the estimated results for FY1999, which indicated a surplus of $3.3\nmillion equivalent. For FY2000, a deficit of $15.0 million equivalent is expected.\n110. The consolidated rate charge is an area of concern, as it could be a substantial source\nof revenue for CMC. Currently, it is the single largest source of tax revenue for CMC, but\ngenerates the lowest revenues per capita among India\u2019s major cities.11 However, there has\nbeen major progress since 1998 when CMC\u2019s master record files were computerized. The\nconsolidated rate charge arrears are now computerized and statements issued. Accordingly\ncollection efficiency of present demand bills is above 60 percent, and receipts have been rising\nat 15 percent per annum over the last five years. The method CMC uses for determining\nannual valuations for the consolidated rate charge is to value properties on their estimated\nARV, assessed at fair rental rates. With this method, it is almost impossible to achieve full\nmarket rental for a property, as the level of rent is limited by legislation, thereby constraining\nrevenue (para. 36).\nb.  Assumptions and Bases for the Financial Projections\n111. The proposed funding and cost recovery mechanisms for Calcutta\u2019s sewerage and\ndrainage are the implementation of a two-part fee structure. The system is based on a water\ntariff  surcharge  and  the  allocation  of  a  fixed  percentage  of  the  consolidated  rate  charge\ncollections  to  cover  all  recurrent  costs  and  some  capital  cost  of  sewerage  and  drainage\nfacilities. The SWM component includes 3 subcomponents: municipal waste management,\nbiomedical  waste,  and  hazardous  waste.  The  assumptions  and  bases  for  the  financial\nevaluation are designed to ensure CMC\u2019s financial sustainability, while maintaining affordable\ncharges and taxes. The key financial assumptions and bases are discussed in paras. 112-118.\nc.  Affordability and Willingness to Pay\n112. The financial projections are presented on a fiscal year basis, ending on 31 March.\nProjections are prepared to FY2012 and are, of necessity, based in part on actual, estimated,\nand budgeted financial data. Inflation has been projected at the local rate, and state domestic\n                                                \n11Second Municipal Finance Commission, Government of West Bengal.", "29\nproduct growth has been assumed at 6.7 percent with the assumption that most revenues and\ncosts will increase at around half this rate in real terms at 3.35 percent per annum.  Population\ngrowth, although quite low at around 0.6 percent for CMC as a whole, is projected to increase\nat around 2.5 percent per annum in the project area. The consolidated rate charge collection\nefficiency is projected to increase to 80 percent by FY2005, and the method of assessment is\nexpected to be reformed by FY2003 (para.36). All water supply consumers with a connection\nof 20 mm dia. or greater, will be required to pay a minimal charge, and a 50 percent surcharge\nfor sewerage and drainage by FY2002. The cost-of-living allowance will continue to cover\nCMC\u2019s full liability. The government of West Bengal will transfer 3.9 percent of the state\u2019s tax\nrevenue annually to CMC under the agreed tax sharing arrangement.\n113. A  typical  water  supply  or  sewerage  connection  can  serve  the  needs  of  several\nhouseholds. About 18 percent of the population (250,000 people) in the project area are served\nby the sewerage system, and each connection typically serves 2.5 households. Adopting this\nratio, and an urbanization rate of 2.5 percent per annum in the project area, the number of\nsewerage connections in the project area will reach 100,000 by FY2007, covering some 60\npercent of the target population.\n114. Based on the universally adopted guideline that the total cost of direct user charges for\nwater supply and sanitation services should not exceed of 5-6 percent of monthly household\nincome, affordability levels have been examined. Water tariffs will be increased over the next\nfew years, but the exact level is not yet known. Based on ADB\u2019s general experience however,\nwater supply and sanitation each represent about 50 percent of the total. Therefore, sanitation\ncharges should not exceed 2.5 percent of monthly household income. Based on this premise,\ntwo representative income levels are considered in the affordability analysis. The first is the\nmedian household income level (Rs3,700 per month in 1999). The second is the income level\n(Rs2,670 and below in 1999), below which community water standpipes and latrines would be\nthe affordable and appropriate option.\n115. Costs for sewerage and drainage will be partly recovered through the consolidated rate\ncharge, and partly through a direct user charge. The monthly direct user charge is projected for\nthe years FY2002 (year of introduction), FY2006, and FY2016, and expressed as a ratio of the\nprojected median and lower bound income, respectively. In FY2002, the user charge would\nrepresent 1.1 percent and 1.6 percent; in FY2006, it would represent 1.3 and 1.8 percent; and\nin FY2011, it would represent 1.2 and 1.6 percent. All of these ratios are substantially below\nthe affordability limit of 2.5 percent. If the consolidated rate charge (indirect recovery) is also\nconsidered, then based on a 15 percent allocation of the average tax of Rs600/annum, or\nRs50/month, the indirect charge would represent 1.3 percent of the median household income.\nWith respect to the poorer groups, the lowest level of consolidated rate charge payable is\ncurrently Rs300/annum, which is considered to be the cut-off point for poor households; below\nthis level poor households are exempt from the consolidated rate charge. For the median case\ntherefore, the sum of direct and indirect user charges will represent 2.6 percent of household\nincome,  and  for  the  poorer  groups  the  direct  user  charge  will  represent  1.8  percent  of\nhousehold income. On this basis the proposed cost recovery mechanisms are considered\naffordable.\n116. Indirect recovery of costs for the SWM operations is proposed through the consolidated\nrate charge (15 percent allocation), as is currently applied. This will represent 1.3 percent of\nthe median household income. As with sewerage and drainage, poor households will not\ncontribute because they are exempted from the consolidated rate charge.", "30\nd.  Cost Recovery Mechanisms\n117. Virtually  the  whole  water  supply  system  is  unmetered,  except  for  a  few  ICI\nestablishments. CMC has indicated its intention to implement a metering program under which\nall unmetered connections will pay a flat rate of Rs100/month. Once a meter is installed, the\nconsumer is to begin paying on a progressive block rate tariff system, which will incorporate a\nlifeline charge for the poorer groups. For sewerage and drainage, a 50 percent surcharge on\nthe water tariff of domestic consumers and 80 percent on ICI consumers will be set up to\nrecover part of the costs. In addition, 15 percent of the consolidated rate charge will be\nallocated for supporting water supply, 15 percent for sewerage and drainage, and 15 percent\nfor SWM.\n118. The initial connection charge to the system will be around Rs6,000, depending on the\nlocation of the premises. It is proposed that CMC will finance the cost of connections under the\nProject, and recover the cost through the consolidated rate charge collection system and/or\nwater bills, over a two-year period.\nd.  Financial Evaluation\n119. Financial projections of CMC\u2019s operations, including the proposed project investments,\nhave been prepared and evaluated to FY2012. The projections are based on the assumptions\ndiscussed in paras. 112-118, the proposed cost recovery mechanisms, proposed operational\nrequirements, and the population forecasts and planning targets. The projections indicate that,\nas a result of the Project, CMC will become financially stronger. CMC will be able to recover all\ncurrent and incremental O&M costs, and service 100 percent of project debt (interest and\nprincipal repayments) after project completion.\nB. Risks\n120. Through legal due diligence during processing, ADB has sought to identify all significant\nrisks, and devise a management strategy to mitigate the risks to the proposed Project. These\nrisks relate to land acquisition, user charges, rationalization of CMC staff, property tax reform,\nand audit requirements.\n121. Land Acquisition. Some land will need to be acquired for the sewerage and drainage\ncomponent. The two risks associated with land acquisition are (i) delays in acquisition, and (ii)\nunfair compensation. These risks are mitigated by acquiring all land on a solid legal basis, for\nwhich the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 provides the necessary legal base. The 1894 act\nprovides  for  compensation  on  a  comprehensive  basis.  The  risk  of  inappropriately  low\ncompensation triggering litigation and attendant delays is mitigated by the West Bengal Land\nAcquisition Manual of 1991, which guides the state government in calculating compensation.\n122. Property Tax Reform. Some reform measures are needed to improve CMC\u2019s financial\nposition. The basic reform is to change the capital valuation of property from an ARV to an\narea-based method of assessment. Therefore, capital valuation of property, as currently set\nforth in the CMC Act, should be implemented by area. Assuming the legal framework is set\ndown  in  a  very  clear  manner,  the  logistical  problems  of  tax  reform  will  still  need  to  be\naddressed.  This  risk  is  to  be  mitigated  through  (i)  a  comprehensive  capacity  building\ncomponent, and a program of workshops/seminars with similar progressive municipalities in\nBihar, Gujarat and Karnataka; and (ii) loan conditionalities.", "31\n123. Government of West Bengal\u2019s Public Finances. The state government is a subsidiary\nborrower under the Project. It is also taking on debt to finance other projects such as water\nsupply and highways. These investments will affect the state government\u2019s fiscal performance.\nTo  assess  the  risk  of  adverse  fiscal  impact,  ADB  assessed  the  state  government\u2019s  fiscal\nsituation.  Although  the  study  revealed  that  the  government  needs  to  improve  its  fiscal\nperformance to meet future investments, it concluded that the state can afford the Project. The\ngovernment\u2019s annual counterpart commitments represent only approximately 2.0 percent of the\ntotal state budget. The risk of default on counterpart contributions due to inadequate fiscal\nresources is therefore minimal, and mitigated through assurances that the government will meet\nall necessary counterpart funding requirements.\nVI. ASSURANCES\nA.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness\n124. As a condition to the effectiveness of the Loan Agreement, the state government will\nhave enacted amendments to the CMC Act, which will (i) enable CMC to issue regulations or\nadopt  budget  estimates,  requiring  all  users  to  pay  a  direct  flat  rate  surcharge  based  on\nconsumer connection size for sewerage and drainage for all unmetered water connections; (ii)\nensure that CMC will be externally audited on an annual basis no later than 12 months after\nthe end of each fiscal year; and (iii) enable CMC to have a separate  account for SWM as part\nof the municipal fund, and allocate 15 percent of the amounts realized from the consolidated\nrate charge to that account.\n125. As further conditions to the effectiveness of the Loan Agreement, (i) the on-lending\nagreement, satisfactory to ADB, will have been executed and delivered on behalf of the state\ngovernment  and  CMC,  and  will  have  become  fully  effective  and  binding  upon  the  state\ngovernment and CMC in accordance with its terms; and (ii) the DFID agreement will have been\nexecuted and delivered, and all conditions precedent to its effectiveness shall have been\nfulfilled, or arrangements satisfactory to ADB shall have been made for its fulfillment.\nB. Specific Assurances\n126.

Although some lessons can be drawn\nfrom all these projects, the KUIDP is most relevant to the Project, and provides the most\nlessons. The lessons learned from the other projects are very similar to those of the KUIDP.\nA. Lessons Learned\n  1. Overall Implementation Schedule\n2. The appraisal schedule envisaged an implementation period of six years commencing in\nJanuary 1996 with full completion of all KUIDP activities by the end of December 2001. The\nexecuting agency (EA) took nine months to mobilize the consultants and a further year to\ncomplete the designs before procurement could commence. Despite delays and slow progress\nand disbursements, the EA estimates that the KUIDP will be on schedule. Thus, six years is an\nadequate period of time for implementing an integrated urban development project. However,\nadvance  action  to  field  consultants  immediately  following  loan  effectiveness  would  help\nsignificantly.\n2. KUIDP Implementation Arrangements\n3. The EA established a project management unit (PMU). The PMU is assisted by an\ninternational  project  management  consultant  and  two  domestic  design  and  construction\nsupervision consulting firms. A domestic consultant for the benefit monitoring and evaluation\nprogram  commenced  work  in  March  1999.  The  PMU  is  responsible  for  coordinating  and\nmanaging all KUIDP activities, and coordinating all consulting services. The delineation of\nresponsibility between project management and design and supervision services is proving to\nbe  very  effective.  The  poverty  alleviation  components  are  being  implemented  through\nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations, which are being\nfinanced under the Project. Even with the help of these grassroots organizations, it has taken\n12-18 months to gain the trust of the communities and mobilize their resources. Adequate time\nneeds to be provided to ensure the true participation of communities in projects. Further,\nexperienced  NGOs  should  be  used.  Inexperienced  NGOs  can  cause  serious  delays  in\nmobilizing a program. NGOs have reported however, that the KUIDP has generally benefited\ntheir other development programs by legitimizing their presence, providing improved access to\nlocal governments, and generally heightening their status.\n4. The 11 implementing agencies (IAs) in four towns are involved in executing the KUIDP.\nTo support the PMU and the town-level IAs, project implementation units (PIUs) have been\nestablished in each project town. Loan reviews revealed that the roles of the PIUs were not well", "41\nAppendix 3, page2\ndefined. As a result, the IAs did not seek/accept support from the PIUs. Following a more\ndetailed definition of roles, the arrangement appears to be working well. The IAs are now\ndeveloping greater skills through the revised arrangements, preparing them much better to take\nover operation of the new facilities following completion of the KUIDP. The PMU, PIUs, and IAs\nmust be adequately staffed in terms of capability and numbers, and continuity of leadership\nmust be maintained. The IAs tend to suffer from inadequate staffing. Project planning should\ntake into consideration such constraints.\n3. Contract Awards and Disbursements\n5. A number of problems with procurement of civil works, engineers\u2019 estimates, Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) procedures, and quality control have been experienced under KUIDP.\nThe tender documents include a number of provisions that differ from the tender conditions\nnormally used by the IAs, such as the cost of third party inspection, the risk associated with\nfixed price contracts, the cost of performance bonds, quality control, and interest costs. The\ndomestic  contractors  must  be  given  very  clear  instructions  on  ADB  requirements,\nprequalification of contractors must be undertaken carefully, and greater effort is required to\neducate the contracting industry. A series of workshops may be appropriate.\nB. Land Acquisition\n6. Delayed  land  acquisition  has  delayed  the  KUIDP\u2019s  initial  implementation.  One\ncomponent for industrial sites and services has been dropped because the land could not be\nacquired.  The  KUIDP  experience  demonstrates  the  need  to  undertake  land  acquisition\nprocedures as early as possible to avoid delays, and consider phased conditionalities to ensure\nintermediate procedures are proceeding in a timely manner. Further, a solid legal framework\nshould be established for land acquisition during loan processing to avoid any changes to the\nscope of work during implementation as a result of failure to acquire the land needed. Based on\nthe KUIDP experience, land acquisition can take more than two years to complete.\nC. Legislation Amendments for Property Tax Reform\n7. Under  the  KUIDP,  increased  revenue  generation  was  sought  through  property  tax\nreform. This comprised changing the basis of annual ratable valuation from a rental to an area\nbasis. There have been some difficulties in implementing the reforms, primarily because the\nlegal  framework  was  not  clearly  established  before  attempting  to  introduce  the  necessary\nreforms. Such legal amendments must be agreed and passed well in advance of the logistical\nmeasures required to effect such change. One successful measure taken under the KUIDP to\nimprove property tax revenue has been to computerize the billing and collection, which has\nsubstantially increased revenue.", "POLICY AND INSTITUTIONAL REFORM AGENDA\nObjective Current Situation Action\nFY2002 FY2003 FY2004 FY2005\n1.

The sewerage and drainage component of the proposed Project requires that substantial\nland be acquired quickly and efficiently (no longer than 24 months), but with due regard for\ntransparency and compensation for those whose land is being acquired. The two possible\nalternative procedures for land acquisition under consideration are (i) negotiated acquisition by\nCalcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) under Section 536 of the CMC Act of 1980; and (ii)\ncompulsory land acquisition through a CMC application to the state government under Sections\n533 and 537 of the CMC Act of 1980, or state government compulsory land acquisition under\nthe Land Acquisition Act of 1894. Under Section 446 of the CMC Act 1980, however, the land\nacquisition powers of CMC only relate to acquisition of rights of users of bustees, and therefore\nappear not to be suitable for most project-related land acquisition. The most suitable alternative\nis compulsory land acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act of 1894.\nB. Policies and Procedures for Land Acquisition\n2. The 1894 Land Acquisition Act sets forth the procedures for land acquisition. First, under\nSection 4(1) of the 1894 Act, when the state government seeks to acquire land in any locality for\nany public purpose the state government has to provide (i) a publication of a preliminary\nnotification in the official gazette, (ii) publication in two daily newspapers of which at least one\nwill be in the regional language, and (iii) public notice at convenient places in the locality.  After\nsuch notification, entry and surveys can be carried out by the state government in accordance\nwith Sections 4(2) and 5 of the 1894 Act. Second, after notification, any person interested in\nland that has been notified can raise objections under Section 5A of the 1894 Act and will be\nheard by the collector. No time is specified in Section 5A for disposition of such objections\nhearings, but the state government\u2019s decision is final at this stage. Third, under Section 6 of the\n1894 Act, the state government declares the intended acquisition, but only after it has the funds\nfor compensation payments. The declaration has to be published in the official gazette, and in\ntwo daily newspapers of which at least one shall be in the regional language, and public notice\nof the declaration has to be provided in convenient places in the locality.\n3. Fourth, under Section 8 of the 1894 Act, the collector (head of the district) marks out the\nland to be acquired and under Section 9 of the 1894 Act, the collector provides public notice to\ninterested  persons  to  appear  in  person  or  by  an  agent  before  him  regarding  claims  for\ncompensation and objections to Section 8 measurement.  Under Section 11A, a maximum of\ntwo years is allowed from the declaration of intention to acquire to the collector\u2019s award of\ncompensation, failing which the acquisition lapses. The collector is entitled to take possession of\nthe land under Sections 16 and 17 of the 1894 Act. Finally the 1894 Act procedure for land\nacquisition allows the collector\u2019s award of compensation to be appealed to the courts under the\n1894 Act Sections 18 to 28. Appeals to the district court, high court, and supreme court are\npossible.  However, the risk of litigation-attendant delays are mitigated for priority acquisition of\nland such as for the proposed Project through the narrow test for such litigation in the 1894 Act\nand adherence by the collector to the procedures and basis for compensation set forth in the\n1894 Act and the West Bengal Land Acquisition Manual 1991 (para. 5).\n4. Section  23  of  the  1894  Act  provides  for  compensation  on  a  comprehensive  basis\nconsisting of (i) market value of land acquired; (ii) damages for standing crops and trees on the\nland; (iii) damages for severing land when the collector takes possession of it; (iv) damages for", "51\nAppendix 9, page 2\nthe  acquisition  injuriously  affecting  the  person\u2019s  other  movable  or  immovable  property;  (v)\nreasonable expenses for change of residence or place of business; (vi) damages for loss of\nprofits between publication of the declaration and the collector\u2019s possession of the land; (vii)\nloss of earnings from loss of the land acquired; (viii) 12 percent of the market value of the\nacquired land from the publication of the notification under Section 4(1) to the date of award of\nthe Collector or taking possession of the land, whichever is earlier; and (viii) 15 percent of the\nmarket value of the acquired land for the compulsory nature of the acquisition.\n5. The risk of inappropriately low compensation triggering litigation and attendant delays is\nmitigated by the West Bengal Land Acquisition Manual of 1991 (the Manual), which guides the\nstate government in calculating compensation. Thus, section 64 of the Manual states\u2026\u2026\u201cAs far\nas possible, everyone who is deprived of property by compulsory acquisition should be enabled\nby the compensation awarded to him to place himself in substantially the same position in which\nhe was before the acquisition\u201d\u2026.  In addition, section 68 of the manual provides for an objective\nbasis for market valuation of the land by (i) referring to the average of sales that took place at\nthe time of the notification of similar lands in the same or adjoining localities, and (ii) a review of\n15-20 deeds executed on dates immediately before the relevant date taken from the local\nsubregistry office for similar land in the same locality. Similarly, section 73 of the manual\nprovides helpful guidance on calculation of damages, loss of earnings, expenses, and loss of\nprofits. The district magistrate responsible for the district in which the majority of land will be\nacquired reports that all land acquisition is normally completed within 6-12 months.\nC. Scale of Land Acquisition\n6. The precise locations of the land areas required for the Project cannot be determined\nyet.  During  the  detailed  design  process,  land  locations  will  be  finalized,  and  acquisition\nprocedures put in place.

This summary draws on the resettlement plan (RP) prepared for the Project. Two project\ncomponents will require land acquisition: (i) sewerage and drainage improvements (part B), and\n(ii) solid waste management (part C). Canal improvements (part E) will require the relocation of\ninformal dwellers from government-owned lands (canals); for the purpose of this appendix, this\nwill be classified as \u201cland acquisition\u201d.\nA. Implementation Arrangements\n2. Resettlement will be the responsibility of the Irrigation and Waterways Department (IWD)\nof  the  government  of  West  Bengal  and  the  Calcutta  Municipal  Corporation  (CMC).  Each\norganization will have a project management unit, which will contain personnel with community\ndevelopment skills for managing the resettlement operations. Nongovernment organizations\n(NGOs), engaged under the loan, will facilitate implementation of the resettlement plan, and will\nserve as the link to the affected people. The NGOs will involve the affected people in all\ndecision-making regarding relocation and resettlement criteria, facilitate formation of livelihood\ngroups, encourage the formation of community-based organizations, and ensure that affected\npeople are assisted according to agreed entitlements. No Calcutta NGOs have resettlement\nexperience;  however,  some  Calcutta  NGOs  have  demonstrated  experience  and  skill  in\nimplementing community development programs and would be suitable for this activity. At the\ncommunity level, community resettlement groups will be established. These will be broad-based\ngroups to provide representation for all affected people. At least 50 percent of committee\nmembers will be women.\nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n1. Sewerage and Drainage Improvements (Part B)\n3. The land required for development works under this component is not large, i.e., 15\nhectares (ha) for the sewage treatment plant, and 0.25-4.0 ha for each of the nine pumping\nstations. Two possible locations for the sewage treatment plant have been identified, one of\nwhich is in the jurisdiction of the Rajpur Sonarpur Municipality (RSM). Although the municipality\nand  CMC  own  these  marshy  lands,  the  lands\u2019  encroachers  are  living  on  them.  About  50\nencroachers are on the CMC and about 25 are on the RSM land. When these lands are taken\nover by CMC, these encroachers will lose their livelihoods. Except for the Beerpara sewerage\npumping  station,  tracts  of  marshy  lands  belonging  to  CMC  are  being  considered  for  the\nremaining  eight  pumping  stations.  For  the  Beerpara  pumping  station,  the  possible  sites\nidentified include two public parks and one pond near a railway bridge.\n2. Solid Waste Management (Part C)\n4. About 2 ha of land will be required for the construction of garage facilities in Javadpur.\nPrivately owned land suitable for the purpose has been identified. While 80 ha of land required\nfor the compost plant is already available at Dhapa, the development program will eventually\nclose off the existing landfill to trash sorters. Approximately 625 trash sorters will lose their\nlivelihoods. While 2.28 ha of land required for the compost plant is already available at Noapara,\nthe Project will also eventually close the site to trash sorters, about 30 sorters will lose their\nlivelihoods.", "54\nAppendix 10, page 2\n3. Canal Improvements (Part E)\n5. About 58 settlements are located along 34 km of canals that will be improved under the\nProject. The Project will potentially displace about 3,600 households (11,000 people) along the\ncanal banks. Efforts have been made to minimize displacement by reducing the width of the\ncanals,  reclaiming  of  land  from  canal  banks,  and  maneuvering  rights-of-way  to  allow  the\nhouseholds to remain in place. Where relocation is unavoidable, people will be moved to sites\nas close to their existing homes as possible, at a maximum distance of 800 meters and up to 2\nkilometers in some unavoidable cases. By avoiding relocation to distant sites, affected people\nwill be able to continue with their present employment.\nC.  Policy Framework and Entitlements\n6. The Asian Development Bank policy on Involuntary Resettlement and the 1894 Land\nAcquisition Act provide the framework for resettlement. Within this framework, the resettlement\nplan provides a comprehensive package of compensation and assistance to all affected people.\nThe plan provides mitigation for (i) loss of assets, including land, house, or workplace;  (ii) loss\nof livelihood or income opportunities; and (iii) collective impacts on groups, such as the loss of\ncommunity assets and other common property resources.\n7. Affected people will be given the option to relocate themselves to a place of their\npreference or to move to a relocation site. Those who relocate themselves will be paid an\namount equivalent to the replacement value of their existing structure. Affected people moving\nto relocation sites will be allocated a plot area of 17 square meters for households with 5\nmembers, and 20 square meters for households with more than 5 members or more than 3\nadult members. People who have no legal title to their land constitute the majority of affected\npersons under the Project. The housing package for canal dwellers and others with no legal title\nwill include (i) a plot area for a house, (ii) replacement value of the existing structure, less\nsalvage  value;  (iii)  assistance  for  upgrading  from  a  thatched-roof  structure  to  a  structure\ncomprising bamboo and roofing material; and (iv) a resettlement allowance for a reasonable\nperiod as will be decided by the implementation committee. The implementation committee will\ncomprise project management unit staff and canal-level community resettlement groups. CMC\nwill assist specially vulnerable households to build their houses in the relocation sites.\n8. Canal improvement works will commence only after relocation is complete. Affected\npeople will transfer to the relocation houses only after their new houses are built. Affected\npeople will build their own houses in the new sites. Once the movement to the new site is\ncompleted, the affected people, with assistance from IWD/CMC, will demolish the old houses.\nThe affected people will be encouraged to salvage materials at the time of demolition.\nD.  Consultations and Disclosure of Information\n9. Consultations  and  numerous  discussions  have  been  held  with  key  people  and\nstakeholders. To make the public consultations effective, participatory rapid appraisal exercises\nin the form of group meetings and discussions were conducted with groups of stakeholders. Key\npeople were identified in each locality. Most key people are actually the local ward committee,\nmunicipal,  and  village  councilors  or  members;  political  and  religious  leaders;  youth\nrepresentatives; schoolteachers; or other eminent people within the locales. The key people\nwere instrumental in discussions with affected people on the design of resettlement packages,\noptions for housing, location of new sites, etc. Separate meetings were held with women to\nidentify  their  specific  needs  and  concerns.  The  more  vulnerable  among  the  women  were", "55\nAppendix 10, page 3\nidentified for added assistance. The women were also consulted on site selection, housing\npattern, civic amenities, and livelihood concerns. The Project takes adequate measures for\ndisclosure of the resettlement plan.\nE.  Grievance Redress and Transparency\n10. The Project will establish a grievance redress mechanism to deal with complaints from\naffected  people.  There  will  be  one  information  booth  for  each  canal-level  community\nresettlement group. Each group will have a member secretary who will be responsible for\ndisseminating  information  and  receiving  the  summary  requirements  of  the  settlement-level\ncommunity  resettlement  group  and  stakeholder  complaints.  The  NGOs  will  ensure  that\ngrievances are acted upon in an effective manner. The Project\u2019s participatory approach to\nimplementation will ensure transparency and accountability.  NGOs are expected to play a\nsignificant role in this approach.  To avoid any accusation of impropriety and corruption, all\npayments relating to compensation and resettlement assistance will be made publicly.\nF.  Vulnerable Groups\n11. People who will be affected by the Project are mostly living below the poverty line.\nThere are 2,157 households who are considered poor, and 317 are households headed by\nwomen, and 264 by elderly people.  Many children between the ages of 7 and 14 years work in\nthe settlements. Boys work mostly in teashops and small roadside shops or industries.  Girls\nmostly  work  as  domestic  helpers.  During  the  monsoon  months,  children  work  in  prawn\nprocessing centers.  When there is a short supply of prawns, children then move on to work as\ntrash sorters in landfill sites. In the Dhapa landfill site, sorters (adults and children) will lose their\nlivelihood  with  the  mechanization  of  solid  waste  management  by  the  year  2010.  The\nresettlement plan incorporates an action plan for retraining sorters at the Dhapa landfill site. In\nthe interim period, sorters will be provided with gloves, boots, aprons, and masks, and will be\ngiven periodic health check-ups. With the closure of the landfill site, they will be assisted to\nestablish alternative livelihoods.  An action plan for the rehabilitation of child workers from canal\nsettlements and landfill sites is part of the resettlement plan. Children will be withdrawn from\nemployment and assisted in getting accommodation in schools, and for those who are 7 years\nold and above, they will be trained for one year to prepare them for admission to existing formal\nschools.\nG.  Monitoring and Evaluation\n12. The social development unit within CMC will be responsible for internal monitoring. The\nfocus  of  internal  monitoring  will  be  on  (i)  compensation  and  assistance  package,  (ii)\nresettlement, (iii) recovery, (iv) vulnerable groups, (v) women, (vi) information sharing and\nconsultation,  (vii)  grievance  redress,  and  (viii)  budget  and  implementation  scheduling.  The\nsocial  development  unit  will  contract  out  external  monitoring  to  a  qualified  social  science\nresearch institute, an NGO, or a consulting firm. The external monitoring agency will submit\nquarterly reports in the first three years of the Project, and then two reports a year for the\nremaining project duration. External monitoring will verify the results of internal monitoring, and\nevaluate whether the objectives of the resettlement plan are being met.", "56\nAppendix 11, page 1\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION\nA.  Introduction\n1. The summary initial environmental examination is based on the initial environmental\nexamination (IEE) report prepared for the Project. Intensive discussions were held with the state\ngovernment, community-based organizations, and nongovernment organizations, and site visits.\nThe Project is a comprehensive six-year project to improve environmental quality within the\nCalcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) area. The principal objective of the Project is to prepare\nan urban infrastructure and environmental management investment to achieve a sustainable\nimprovement in the environment of Calcutta. The Project\u2019s components are: (i) stakeholder\nconsultation process, (ii) sewerage and drainage improvements, (iii) solid waste management\n(SWM), (iv) slums improvements, (v) canal improvements, and (vi) implementation assistance\nand capacity building. The Project will improve wastewater and storm drainage management,\nand SWM systems to address solid waste including biomedical and hazardous wastes. The\nProject will improve living conditions for slum dwellers and increase the efficiency of the system\nof canals that carries surface and wastewater away from Calcutta.\nB.  Summary Environmental Improvements due to Project Interventions\n2. The construction of wastewater treatment plants will reduce the load of heavy metals,\norganic  chemicals,  and  other  potential  contaminants  in  the  city\u2019s  wastewater  discharges.\nReducing  the  volume  of  these  contaminants  will  improve  the  quality  of  wastewater  flows\ncurrently being discharged to the Ganges or Kulti rivers through the system of channels and\ncanals, and will reduce the potential for health impacts as wastewater effluents are widely used\nto irrigate crops and to support fish farms. Rehabilitating the channels and canals in Calcutta will\nreduce the potential for flooding in the city and will enhance the quality of life of people in areas\nsubject to inundation.\n3. Enhanced  SWM  will  improve  garbage  collection  and  upgrade  current  management\npractices. This will reduce the health impacts caused by unsanitary SWM practices and help\nreduce problems caused by disease vectors. An increased program of separating waste at\nsource,  recovering  recyclable  materials,  and  improving  landfill  operations  will  reduce  the\ncontamination of surface and groundwater flowing into the East Calcutta Wetlands. Expanding\nthe program of managing biomedical and hazardous wastes will help protect the public from\npotentially infectious or injurious wastes that are improperly managed. Enhanced hazardous\nwaste management will help address current problems caused by the discharge of heavy\nmetals, solvents, organic chemicals, and other contaminants into the sewers and wastewater\nchannels as well as the solid waste. The program of slum enhancement will increase the\navailability of potable water supplies and sewer systems. This will increase the quality of life of\nthe slum residents, especially women and children, and help protect public health.\n4. The  proposed  Project  will  result  in  a  cumulative  improvement  of  environmental\nconditions and social well being in the Calcutta area. Advances in sewerage and drainage will\nupgrade the overall quality of life. Individuals residing in slums will benefit from the supply of\npotable water and the removal of domestic waste. Enhanced management of solid, biomedical,\nand hazardous wastes will help protect public health and minimize potential problems from the\nuncontrolled release of contaminants. The Project will help protect the East Calcutta Wetlands\nand the livelihoods of the individuals who depend on the food produced there.", "57\nAppendix 11, page 2\nC.  Description of the Environment\n5. Calcutta is within the lower tidal reaches of the Ganges River. The area is mostly flat,\nsloping in general from north to south, containing numerous low-lying areas, marshes, wetlands,\nand shallow lakes. The city is highly urbanized and the land-use pattern reflects the relatively\nflat landscape and the historical sequence of development. The area is seismically stable. The\nclimate is hot and humid and temperatures in Calcutta remain high throughout the year.\n6. The CMC jurisdiction receives 80 percent of its water from surface sources and 20\npercent from groundwater. The majority of the surface water is extracted from the Ganges River\nat  Palta,  approximately  25  kilometers  upstream  of  the  city,  where  it  is  treated  prior  to\ndistribution. The principal productive aquifer generally occurs between 50 and 180 meters (m)\nbelow the ground level, while a shallow aquifer, tapped by small diameter tubewells, occurs\nbetween 20 and 40 m below the ground level. The receiving waters in Calcutta that have been\nclassified  are  all  in  Class  E:  \u201cIrrigation,  industrial  cooling,  and  controlled  waste  disposal.\u201d\nThroughout the Ganges River Basin a huge quantity of water is drawn from the river and returns\nas wastewater without treatment. Domestic and industrial pollution, along with run-off from\nareas that drain to the river, has led to deterioration in the quality of water in the river.\n7. In the CMC area, the development of sanitary sewers and combined sewers to collect\nand transport wastewater and urban runoff away from the city was initiated in 1885. However,\nsewers serve only 45 to 50 percent of the city. In the project areas, only 17 percent of the\nhouseholds are connected to sewers, while 68 percent use septic tanks and 10 percent use pit\nlatrines. While the existing sewers are adequate in certain areas during dry weather conditions,\nthey are a problem in wet weather due to inadequate channel capacity. About 80 percent of the\nsewer capacity is blocked with silt and sediment. Encroachment of residences and businesses\nalong the banks of the channels, improperly sized culverts and causeways, and siltation has\nreduced the capacity of the canals by approximately 50 percent. As a result, approximately 55\npercent of CMC residents suffer from frequent water logging after heavy rains.\n8. Less than 49 percent of the municipal solid waste is currently collected. Only about 20\npercent of the collected waste stream is recycled. It is not possible to estimate the type and\namount of hazardous wastes being generated in the CMC area. Approximately 15 tonnes per\nday of biomedical waste is generated in the CMC area; the collected waste is transported to a\ndisposal facility at Dhapa. Approximately one third of the CMC population of 5.0 million live in\nbustees (slum areas), with substandard housing and lack or have restricted access to basic\nurban environmental infrastructure.\n9. The project area is highly urbanized. The development of the canal drainage system,\ncombined with the development of roads and buildings has resulted in loss of much of native\nflora  and  fauna.  The  only  significant  ecological  and  natural  resource  are  East  Calcutta\nWetlands, an area of 6,000 hectares, the largest remaining open space in the city and part of\nthe largest wetland areas in South Asia. Calcutta contains significant cultural resource. Calcutta\nhas a number of artificial lakes within its municipal borders; these provide habitat for a number\nof aquatic and avian species and accommodate recreation activities. Urban development has\nadversely affected the environment of all urban lakes. Archaeological monuments of north\nCalcutta reflect the traditional culture, and the structures of central Calcutta reflect the British\ncolonial  style  and  are  50  to  100  years  old.  Valuable  monuments  are  maintained  by  the\nDepartment of Archaeology or by private concerns.", "58\nAppendix 11, page 3\nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\na. Impacts Due to Project Location\n10. Where  the  proposed  improvements,  such  as  the  wastewater  treatment  plants,  are\nconstructed, some people may have to be relocated. In addition, permanent relocation will be\nrequired to maintain the drainage channels and correct the problems caused by sedimentation\nand  improperly  sized  culverts.  Temporary  disruptions  could  occur  in  communities  where\nimprovements such as sewers will be installed.\n11. Surveys of all residences and businesses that could be disrupted as a result of the\nproposed improvements will be completed before final decisions are made as to the exact\nlocations for new facilities or for the enhancement of existing facilities. These surveys will\nidentify where permanent relocation could be required as opposed to the need for mitigation to\naddress temporary disruption. For example, enhancing the capacity of the canals could require\nthat the residents and businesses located along the banks be permanently moved to protect the\ndesign capacity of the channels. On the other hand, installing sewers in city streets could only\nresult in temporary inconvenience to the local residents. Where required, the proposed Project\nwill provide for resettlement consistent with ADB policy.\nb. Impacts of Construction\n12. Issues that need special attention of the project management during the construction\nstage include excavation, trenching and tunneling, vehicle and equipment operation, silt runoff\nduring  construction,  safety  factors,  health  factors,  nuisance  factors,  cultural  hazards,  and\nhazardous materials.\nc. Impacts of Operation of Enhanced/Newly Provided Environmental Services\n13. Some of the adverse environmental impacts of the proposed Project could include failure\nof  pumping  stations;  overflow/bypassing  hazards;  illegal  industrial  discharges;  solid  waste;\nsludge treatment and disposal; and accidental spills of municipal, hazardous, and biomedical\nwaste during transportation, However, standard engineering design, equipment, and practices\nshould mitigate these potential problems. Both hazardous and biomedical facilities will have\nsecure treatment and storage capacities. Incinerators should have adequate emission control\nprovisions and as a minimum comprise of (i) a ventury scrubber to lower gas temperatures for\nsubsequent  treatment;  (ii)  a  packed  tower  scrubber  utilizing  sodium  hydroxide  solution\nmaintained at pH 10 by auto-dosing; and (iii) an insulated stainless glass stack terminating not\nless than 30 m above the ground.\nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring System\n14. The existing institutional framework adequately responds to the goals and the tasks of\nthe Project. The West Bengal pollution control board is responsible for environmental monitoring\nand  enhancement  of  environmental  standards  in  the  CMC  area.  In  addition,  project\nmanagement  consultants  will  assist  CMC  in  developing  a  monitoring  plan  to  address  the\nenvironmental  monitoring  requirements  presented  in  this  summary  initial  environmental\nexamination. It is the responsibility of each executing agency to ensure that all permits and\nlicenses  are  obtained  from  the  necessary  environmental  control  authorities  for  all  project\ncomponents.", "59\nAppendix 11, page 4\nF.  Findings and Recommendations\n15. The findings of IEE suggest that the proposed Project has a low level of adverse\nenvironmental concern, and will greatly improve the overall environmental situation in Calcutta.\nThe potential adverse impacts are assessed as moderately insignificant assuming that certain\nmitigation measures will be carried out including:\n(i)  development and implementation of resettlement/relocation plans;\n(ii)  the program for control and handling of biomedical and hazardous waste;\n(iii)  appropriate  siting  of  solid  waste  disposal  sites,  treatment  plants,  sewerage\nworks, and other project facilities;\n(iv)  treatment of sewage to appropriate standards to protect receiving waters and\ncommunity health;\n(v)  construction of sewers and drains by trenchless methods, so far as practicable,\nto mitigate traffic congestion caused by sewer construction;\n(vi)  proper operation and maintenance in maintaining a consistently high quality of\nnewly provided/improved services; and\n(vii)  adequate training for operating personnel, close supervision and process quality\ncontrol, and vigorous monitoring of unit operations and processes, to ensure\nsystems effectiveness.\n16. However,  it  is  considered  good  practice  to  undertake  an  environmental  impact\nassessment for all treatment plants, sewage pumping stations and solid waste facilities, as soon\nas the land is identified and the detailed design is substantially developed.\nG. Conclusions\n17. The proposed Project will not cause significant environmental problems resulting from its\nplanning design, construction, or operation. The Project will provide valuable environmental\nbenefits to the Calcutta area. The need to improve urban infrastructure in the area is urgent, and\nthe Project will provide this in an efficient and environmentally reasonable way. However,\nenvironmental  impact  assessments  should  be  undertaken  for  all  treatment  plants,  sewage\npumping stations and waste facilities, as soon as the land is identified and the detailed design is\nsubstantially developed.", "60\nAppendix 12, page 1\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS\nA.  Clientele Profile\n1. Through improving the environment, the Project\u2019s components are expected to improve\nthe human capital and economic growth of the target area and, in particular, reduce poverty\nthrough mainstreaming the poorer groups. The profile of the clientele groups is based on the\nanalysis  of  detailed  socioeconomic  surveys  and  intensive  consultations  with  the  affected\ncommunities.\n2. The Calcutta metropolitan area is one of the largest urban centers in India, and is\nurbanizing at a rate of about 2.5-3.0 percent/annum. The Calcutta municipal area, on the other\nhand, has a very high population density, and does not experience the same growth. Between\n1950 and 1970, the Calcutta municipal area grew by about 20-30 percent each decade, with\nmuch of the growth occurring over very short periods, caused by geopolitical events or natural\ndisasters. Since the 1970s however, the rate of population growth has declined considerably.\nBetween 1971 and 1981, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) recorded an annual growth\nrate of less than one half percent, and between 1981 and 1991 the total growth for the decade\nwas registered at a little over 6 percent. The 1991 census recorded a population for the Calcutta\nmunicipal area of 4.38 million, with a heavy concentration in the inner wards; the inner wards\nare thought to have densities up to four times what an urban area can support on a sustainable\nbasis; this figure is now expected to be around 5.0 million. Thus, people in these areas are likely\nto move to the outer areas, with a consequent readjustment of the population densities. The\nouter areas, which comprise the project area for most of the components, currently have a total\npopulation of around 1.4 million, with densities ranging from 7,000 to 29,000 people per square\nkilometer. Based on land use maps and recent growth trends, the population in the outer areas\nis expected to grow to around 1.47 million by 2011, and 1.52 million by 2021.\n3. For classification purposes, the term \u201cslum\u201d is used in this document to refer to low-\nincome settlements of high population density that lack adequate public services and amenities.\nAround 50 percent of the target population live in slum housing or worse. A slum dwelling is\ntypically a single roomed, single story, dwelling constructed of nonpermanent building materials.\nAbout  700,000  people  live  in  such  houses.  About  26-30  percent  of  the  slum  dwelling\nhouseholds in the target area live below the poverty line\u2014 about 180,000-210,000 people, or\n13-15 percent of the total population in the project area.1 Low-income or slum settlements\ncomprise registered bustees,2 refugee colonies, unregistered settlements (unregistered bustees\nand canal bank settlements), and pavement dwellers. These settlements represent 29 percent,\n11 percent, and 10 percent of the target population, respectively. The CMC Act, 1980, and the\nThika Tenancy Act aim to mainstream the poor into society through providing them with security\nof tenure and basic services. Under a series of refugee rehabilitation schemes, the Government\nof West Bengal is progressively recognizing refugee colonies (62 colonies recognized to date)\nby providing them with land titles and basic amenities. Unregistered settlements and pavement\ndwellers have no legal recognition by CMC and are, thus, not entitled to any security of tenure\nor basic services.\n                                                \n1 The \u201cpoverty line\u201d in India is defined as income necessary to buy food to meet a daily intake of 2,400 calories of\nenergy in rural areas (2,100 calories in urban areas), and certain basic nonfood items such as clothing and\ntransportation. In monetary terms, this is about Rs300 ($6.50) for urban areas.\n2 A bustee is a settlement of primarily low-income people.", "61\nAppendix 12, page 2\n4. Over 80 percent of the population in the Calcutta municipal area are Hindu, 14 percent\nare Muslim, and several other minority groups make up the balance. Muslims make up a larger\npercentage of slum-dwelling populations (20 percent) than in other areas (10 percent).\nB.  Clientele Needs\n5. Urban population pressure is giving rise to serious concerns about environmental health\nin Calcutta, particularly among the poor and disadvantaged groups. In the target area, only 17\npercent of the target population have a sewerage connection, less than 50 percent of the area is\ncovered by a drainage system, and only 70 percent of the area is served by solid waste collection.\nAlthough infrastructure deficiencies impact on all sections of society, they particularly affect the\nurban  poor\u2014more  than  90  percent  share  toilet  facilities.  Drainage  systems  are  aging  and\ninadequate, which gives rise to frequent flooding and environmental contamination of low-lying\nresidential  areas.  Industrial  wastes  flow,  largely  untreated,  into  the  surrounding  environment,\nexposing the community to acids, toxic chemicals, paints and varnish, and other highly toxic\ncompounds. Smoke from the burning of dung, woodfuel, coal and kerosene inside slum dwellings\npredisposes occupants, especially young children and women, to acute respiratory infections\n(ARIs). Some 77 percent of the survey sample reported having no separate and dedicated\ncooking area. Degradation of the environment is leading to increasing concern about morbidity\nand mortality rates. Although CMC\u2019s database on public health is very limited, it shows that\nmortality rates due to ARI and diarrhea account for around 29 percent of all infant deaths.3\n6. Inadequate shelter is also aggravating health conditions in the slum areas. Of the total\nslum  population,  around  70  percent  of  the  target  population  occupy  a  single  room,\nnonpermanent structure, and around 80 percent occupy dwellings of 36 square meters or less.\nThe population density typical of slum settlements remains a major public health concern with\nregard to the transmission of communicable diseases, especially tuberculosis. In addition, the\nlimited  ventilation  in  single  room  dwellings  exposes  all  family  members  to  the  hazards  of\ncooking smoke.\nC.  Clientele Demands and Willingness to Pay\n7. The  socioeconomic  survey  revealed  a  strong  demand  among  the  Project\u2019s  target\npopulation for improved water supply, and sewerage and drainage systems, ranging from 66 to\n100 percent. The demand was strongest among the poorer groups, indicating the high resource\ncosts  they  perceive  under  existing  circumstances.  Over  90  percent  of  the  respondents  in\nstandard residential dwellings, and almost 95 percent of respondents in registered bustees are\nwilling to pay up to Rs50 ($1.10) per month for improved services. Demand for improved solid\nwaste collection was much lower, indicating a lack of awareness of its linkages with improved\nhygiene and sanitation. Only 5-24 percent of the sample expressed a willingness to pay for\nimproved  collection.  This  will  need  to  be  addressed  through  the  proposed  stakeholder\nconsultation process (SCP) to raise awareness and willingness to pay.\nD.  Affordability to Pay\n8. Based on the universally adopted guideline that the total cost of water supply and\nsanitation services should not exceed of 5 percent of monthly household income, affordability\nlevels have been examined. Water tariffs will be increased over the next few years, but the\nexact  level  is  not  yet  known.  However,  based  on  the  general  experience  of  the  Asian\n                                                \n3 Based on a pilot area program\u2014Calcutta Slum Improvement Project.", "62\nAppendix 12, page 3\nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB), water supply and sanitation are each likely to represent about 50\npercent of the total. Therefore, sanitation should not exceed 2.5 percent of monthly household\nincome.  Based  on  this  premise,  two  representative  income  levels  are  considered  in  the\naffordability  analysis.  The  first  is  the  median  household  income  level  of  Rs3,700/month\n($80/month)  in  1999,  and  the  second  is  the  income  level  below  which  community  water\nstandpipes and latrines are the affordable and appropriate option\u2014Rs2,670/month ($58/month)\nand below in 1999.\n9. Indirect  recovery  of  costs  for  the  solid  waste  management  (SWM)  operations  is\nproposed through the consolidated rate charge system, as is currently applied. The amount of\nconsolidated rate charge to be paid by the individual will be proportional to the value of the\nproperty. Properties owned by low-income families will be assessed at an appropriately low and\naffordable  rate.  Evaluation  of  the  consolidated  rate  charge  (property  tax)  will  be\ncomprehensively addressed under the capacity building component of the Project.\n10. Costs of sewerage and drainage will be partly recovered through the consolidated rate\ncharge and partly through a direct user charge. As with SWM, the affordability of the indirect\ncharge will be considered in detail as part of the capacity building component. The monthly\ndirect  user  charge  is  projected  for  the  years  FY2002  (year  of  introduction),  FY2006,  and\nFY2016,  and  expressed  as  a  ratio  of  the  projected  median  and  lower  bound  income,\nrespectively. In FY2002, the user charge will represent 1.1 percent and 1.6 percent of such\nincomes; in FY2006, it will represent 1.3 and 1.8 percent; and in 2016, it will represent 1.2 and\n1.6 percent. All of these ratios are substantially below the affordability limit of 2.5 percent.\nE.  Benefits of the Project\n11. The Project will improve the urban environment and enhance human capital, which will\nlead to improved health and increased productivity, particularly among the slum dwellers. In the\nlonger  term,  improved  health  will,  in  turn,  contribute  to  better  educational  standards  and\neconomic growth. The SCP will underpin the sustainability of the Project through improved\nrepresentation. In addition, the SCP will empower communities, enabling them to participate\nmore actively and constructively on all civic matters. Around 1.4-5.0 million people will benefit\nfrom the Project, of which some 50 percent reside in slum settlements.\n12. Accessibility by the poor and underprivileged to basic services and improved shelter in\nthe slum settlements will assist in mainstreaming them into society. This will alleviate their\npersonal burden and provide considerable benefit to the people of Calcutta as a whole. About\n190,000 slum dwellers will benefit from direct slum intervention under the Project. Many more\nwill benefit indirectly from improved municipal services, and improved employment opportunities\ngenerated by the considerable labor requirement for the construction work.\nF.  Gender Issues\n13. Although the Project is not specifically targeted at women, all components will help\nimprove their quality of life. Women, as \u201ccaretakers\u201d of the home environment, are affected by\npoor  living  conditions,  particularly  poor  sanitation  standards.  In  addition,  their  exposure  to\ncooking  smoke  increases  the  risk  of  acute  respiratory  infection  substantially.  Improved\nenvironmental sanitation and the replacement of traditional internal cooking fires will enhance\ntheir quality of life.", "63\nAppendix 12, page 4\nG.  Potential Adverse Impacts\n14. Land for sewage treatment plants and pump stations can not be located exactly until\ndetailed  engineering  analysis  has  taken  place,  as  part  of  the  project  implementation.  Any\nresettlement required at that time will be handled under a resettlement framework that is in\naccordance with ADB's Resettlement Policy. This will be used to prepare a detailed resettlement\nplan prior to land acquisition, and will be subject to ADB\u2019s approval.\n15. CMC\u2019s sewerage and drainage system discharges into a network of large canals or\noutfalls, which convey the combined effluent and stormwater to the Ganges River system. The\ncanals are state property, maintained by the Irrigation and Waterways Department. Over many\nyears, people have illegally established settlements along the banks of the canals. These\nsettlements interfere with the flow of the canals, accelerating the natural siltation process of the\ncanals and causing a severe environmental health hazard. The resulting loss of hydraulic\ncapacity requires more frequent maintenance of the canals, the budget for which is already\ninadequate. Consequently, the flooding and environmental hazards are becoming more frequent\nand  more  severe.4  To  dredge  the  canals  and  maintain  permanent  access  for  future\nmaintenance, the canal bank dwellers must be relocated.\n16. The  potentially  affected  persons  along  the  canal  banks  have  been  surveyed  and\nregistered. All efforts were made to seek engineering solutions to minimize resettlement. The\nfirst priority was to minimize resettlement impacts on shopkeepers whose incomes are location-\nspecific.  The  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Involuntary\nResettlement Policy (1995) and Handbook on Resettlement, A Guide to Good Practice (1998).\nA resettlement framework has also been prepared to guide CMC in the preparation of any\nfurther  resettlement plans required under the Project.\nH.  Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n17. The  project  framework  provides  the  Project's  monitoring  indicators  by  project\ncomponent. A detailed benefit and monitoring evaluation plan, including impact evaluation and\nidentification  of  positive  changes  in  the  urban  environment,  such  as  improved  health  and\nnumber and type of beneficiaries covered by new utilities and services, has been prepared.\nSpecific social monitoring is further described under the SCP and the resettlement plans.\n                                                \n4 Loans were taken out by the government of West Bengal to dredge and desilt the canals in the early 1970s and in\nthe early 1990s; they now need further rehabilitation.", "64\nAppendix 13, page 1\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES\nA. Economic Analysis\n \n1. The  analytical  framework  for  determining  whether  resources  are  being  used  in  an\nefficient and sustainable manner is based on the following Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB)\npublications: Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects (1997) and Framework for the\nEconomic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects (1994). A summary of\nthe methodology and assumptions used, a description of the economic costs and benefits, and\nthe result of the analysis follow.\n2. An integral economic analysis has been made for the Project as a whole since the main\neconomic benefits of all components are all related with an improvement in the health situation\nof the population of Calcutta through improvements in the sewerage, drainage, and canals\nsystems of the city and the management of solid waste. The slum improvement component has\nalso been included in the elaboration of the integrated economic analysis. The sewerage,\ndrainage, and canals components will benefit approximately 1.4 million people in the outer\nareas of Calcutta (incremental population of 1.0 million). The solid waste management (SWM)\ncomponent will benefit the whole of the Calcutta municipality with an estimated population of 5.0\nmillion, and the slum improvement component will benefit 190,000 people. The capital costs and\nincremental  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  of  all  components,  except  part  A\n(stakeholder consultation process), have been considered. Per capita values for each economic\nbenefit have been calculated and multiplied by the benefited population.\n1. Economic Costs and Benefits\n3. The  analysis  derived  economic  costs  from  the  financial  project  costs.  All  cost  are\nexpressed in constant (2000) prices.  Physical contingencies of 10 percent have been added to\nthe base costs, and taxes and duties have been discounted at the level of 15 percent for\nequipment and vehicles, 6 percent for civil works and 5 percent for O&M and implementation.\nEconomic  costs  were  valued  using  domestic  currency  and  the  domestic  price  numeraire.\nTradable items were assigned a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.11, the reciprocal of the\nstandard conversion factor of 0.9. A shadow wage rate of 0.7 for unskilled labor in India has\nbeen used to reflect its opportunity costs in the context of wide availability. An allowance has\nbeen  made  for  replacement  investment  over  the  assumed  30  year  life  of  the  Project.\nIncremental O&M costs were taken into account and added to capital costs to obtain the total\neconomic cost of the Project for each year.\n4. The main economic benefit of all the components of the Project is improved human\nhealth. There will also be cost savings due to the different activities of the Project. The method\nused to calculate the health benefits due the project is to multiply disability-adjusted life years\n(DALYs) data by the median per capita income. DALYs are derived by estimating the value of\nlife-years lost because of disability\u2014using a scale from 0 (perfect health) to 1 (death). In 1992\nan estimated 171 DALYs per thousand urban population were lost in West Bengal.1 While the\nWest Bengal data disagregates DALY by disease group, it does not disagregate by major risk\nfactor. The Global Burden of Disease study2 assessed the burden attributable to 10 major risk\nfactors. The researchers concluded that 9.5 percent of DALY losses are attributable to poor\n                                                          \n1  Government of West Bengal. 1999. Health Indicators - West Bengal. State Health Systems Development Project.\nHealth and Family Welfare Department.\n2  Murray, Christopher and Alam, Lopez. 1997. The Global Burden of Disease. A comprehensive assessment of\nmortality and disability from diseases, injuries and risks factors in 1990 and projected to 2020.", "65\nAppendix 13, page 2\nwater and sanitation in India. For this economic analysis, DALY losses attributable to poor\nsewerage and drainage are assumed at 5 percent and the losses attributable to poor SWM at 3\npercent of DALY losses. Additionally, for the slum improvement component, the loss attributable\nto poor housing is assumed to be 1 percent of DALY losses. The median household income at\n1999 prices is Rs66,600 ($1,517) yearly. This means that the average loss per capita due to\nillness is Rs1,881 ($43.2).3 Hence, the per capita loss due to poor sewerage and drainage is\nRs118.3 ($2.7) yearly, while the average loss per capita due to poor SWM is Rs56.5 ($1.3) and\ndue to poor housing is also Rs18.8 ($0.4). The economic value of health benefits will increase in\nline with the increase in state domestic product (SDP) per capita. The value of a DALY loss\nrelates directly to the value of per capita output. The SDP of West Bengal is likely to grow at an\nannual rate of 6.7 percent. The analysis has assumed that the per capita value of health\nbenefits increases at an annual rate of 6 percent.\n5. Other benefits from the Project include benefits from the recycled and compostable\nmaterials, the market value of which is initially considered to be Rs6.3 million ($144,828), rising\nevery 5 years; reduced cost of hospital and health services, equivalent to 5, 3, and 1 percent of\nthe Rs7,768 million ($178.6 million) spent annually on hospital and health services by the\nCalcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC); reduced household expenditure on medical expenses,\nrepresenting about 1.9 percent of household expenditure in the CMC area; reduced expenditure\non  cleaning  and  maintenance  of  septic  tanks,  considering  the  average  annual  price  per\nhousehold for cleaning and rent of septic tank is Rs350 ($8.0); reduced costs of removing solid\nwaste that people dump in canals, representing Rs28.5million ($0.7 million) yearly; reduced\ncosts for repairing road and vehicle damage from flooding, assumed to be 20 percent of CMC\nexpenditure on road maintenance plus an additional 50 percent of that amount for vehicles;\nreduced expenditure on repair of dwellings related to waterlogging, assumed that 5 percent of\nthe total households expenditure on repairs is related to flooding; reduced travel delays due to\nwaterlogging, with the average number of days lost due to flooding is assumed to be 2.5.\n6. The analysis does not include some important benefits that are difficult to value or might\nincur double counting under some circumstances. These nonvalued benefits include increases\nin land values, reduction of flood impacts on economic activities, benefits that accrue to people\nresident outside the CMC area (e.g., benefits to nonresidents who work in Calcutta and benefits\nto visitors), and the emotional benefits of reductions in morbidity and mortality.\n2. Results of the Economic Analysis\n7. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is used as the measure to identify the extent\nto which the Project is economically viable. The EIRR obtained for the Project is 14.5 percent,\nwhich is higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent.\n8. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates the consequences of changes in the values of cost\nand benefits or delays in benefits for 1 or 2 years on the economic viability of the Project, and a\ncombination of both. The results of the analysis show that the EIRR is most sensitive to delays\nin benefits. Additional sensitivity analysis has been made to test the EIRR, when the number of\npeople benefited by the Project is reduced by 10 percent. For all scenarios, the EIRR remains\nrobust. Switching values have been calculated to test how much the benefits could be reduced\nand how much costs could increase before the EIRR reaches 12 percent. The results show a\nswitching value of 18 percent in the case of cost increases and 15 percent in the case of\n                                                          \n3  The figure is obtained as the result of multiplying 171 disability years by the median per capita household income\ndivided by the average number of persons in a household and divided by 1,000.", "66\nAppendix 13, page 3\nbenefits reduction. Hence, while every effort has been made to measure the benefits, some\nhave not been quantified due to measurement difficulties and the difficulties associated with\ntracing all the economic impacts.\nB. Financial Position of the Government of West Bengal\n9. The government of West Bengal will provide financing to contribute to part B (sewerage\nand drainage), part E (canal improvements) and part F (incremental administration for the\nIrrigation  and  Waterways  Department  [IWD]).  The  proposed  funding  of  about  $55  million\nequivalent (about Rs2,550 million) is to be provided by the state government over a six-year\nperiod. This would represent around 2.0 percent of annual current revenues as budgeted for\nFY2001.\n10. The  state  government  is  conscious  of  the  increasing  difficulty  in  the  state\u2019s  public\nfinances and is encouraging broader-based reforms to tackle the issue. In particular, enhancing\nefforts to improve the efficiency of the tax and non-tax systems to mobilize additional revenues,\nand  reducing  unnecessary  government  expenditures  and  efficient  decentralization  of\nadministration are being considered. The contemplated improvement in fiscal management will\nfurther facilitate provision of the counterpart funding, which in any case, amounts to only one\npercent of the state\u2019s annual current revenue. Given the high priority accorded to the Project,\nthe state government confirmed that, despite the present difficult fiscal situation, counterpart\nfunding will be provided on a timely basis during implementation of the project.\nC. Financial Sustainability Analysis of CMC\n11. Financial analysis and financial rates of return were determined in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector\nProjects. Financial analyses were conducted for the urban drainage and sewerage and the\nSWM components, following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Analysis of Projects.\n1.  Financial Practices and Position of CMC\n12. While  CMC  follows  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  because  CMC  lacks\ncomputerized accounting systems, it must rely on cash-based accounting information rather\nthan accrual accounting procedures. The delayed preparation and audit of accounts means that\nproper financial information is not available on a timely basis. Although the general ledger and\ntrial balance (cash) are computerized, with all receipts and payments computerized, most other\naccounting functions are done manually. Under the CMC 1980, the accounts of the corporation\nare to be audited by the state government or by auditors appointed on their behalf. However,\nthere is no time limit on preparing financial accounts by the CMC and completing the audit. The\naudit of the accounts by an international auditor for FY1991 year ended 31 March 1991 has just\nbeen completed. At the same time the CMC provides to the examiner of local accounts, West\nBengal, unaudited copies of its income statement (cash basis) within 12 months of the end of\nthe financial year. Given the lack of up-to-date financial data it has been necessary to rely on\nthe CMC annual budgetary statements of receipts and expenses (both capital and operational)\nwhen reviewing CMC\u2019s past financial performance.\n13. CMC\u2019s financial performance for the last three years shows that for FY1997 (year ended\n31 March 1997), FY1998, and FY1999, CMC achieved a cash surplus on its operations. From\nFY1997 to FY1999 revenues generated by CMC in Calcutta have amounted to around 60\npercent  of  total  receipts  and  are  estimated  to  be  51  percent  in  FY2000.  Of  the  amount", "67\nAppendix 13, page 4\ngenerated by CMC, the consolidated rate charge has been the major source, representing\napproximately 60 percent of revenues over this period. User fees for water, sewerage, and\nSWM  represented  only  5  percent  of  the  revenues  in  FY1999.    The  balance  of  revenue\ngenerated by CMC relates to other taxes and services provided by CMC such as crematoria,\nslaughterhouses, car parking, etc.\n14. The other major source of recurrent revenues is annual transfers from the state of West\nBengal to CMC. The most important transfers include cost-of-living adjustments and increased\ncost of pay for annual incremental increases in salary and wage increases. In FY2000, these\nare estimated at 63 percent of total entitlements. The other main entitlement is the development\ngrant, which is paid in lieu of the collection of the octroi tax on goods and services by CMC; this\nrepresented  26  percent  of  entitlements  from  the  state  government.  All  these  entitlements\nrepresented 89 percent of state transfers in FY2000. The sum of all transfers from the state to\nCMC for FY1999 represented 53 percent of all CMC receipts and is estimated at 49 percent in\nFY2000.\n2. Assumptions for the Financial Projections\n15. Financial projections prepared for CMC consist of projected receipts and expenditures.\nThis includes receipts generated from all locally applied taxes, such as the consolidated rate\ncharge; all nontax receipts, such as sewerage and drainage service charges and water tariffs;\nand  all  regular  transfers  from  the  state.  Expenditures  include  all  recurrent  and  capital\nexpenditures met from revenues. In addition, capital expenditures for the proposed Project are\nincluded in the projections, together with project funding from the state and the Government of\nIndia in the form of debt and grants to support the Project. The balance of the funding is met by\nCMC  from  improved  consolidated  rate  charge  collections,  property  tax  reform  and  the\nintroduction of user charges.\n16. The financial projections are presented on a fiscal year basis with the fiscal year being\nthe 12-month period ending 31 March. The projections are prepared for the 12 year period from\nFY2001 to FY2012. Estimated project costs, projected revenues, and expenses are presented\nin Rupees and US dollars and expressed in current prices incorporating projected general\ninflation over the forecast period. Growth in SDP for West Bengal is estimated at 6.7 percent per\nannum. However, this level of growth may not be sustained over the 12 year forecast period.\nTherefore, it is assumed that revenue and expenses will increase in real terms by half the\ngrowth in SDP as a central assumption, with either zero real growth or growth at 6.7 percent\napplied in specific cases. The CMC population is estimated to be 5.0 million and is assumed to\nincrease by 0.5 percent annually, while project area population of 1.4 million is assumed to grow\nat 2.5 percent per annum through to FY2011 and then 1.5 percent thereafter.\n17. Under  the  Project,  CMC,  in  conjunction  with  the  state,  will  implement  property  tax\nreforms that will build on recent improvements in computerization of master files and collection\nprocedures. Over the shorter term (FY2001-2003), collections will continue increasing at the\nsame level as in previous years. Over the medium term (FY2003-2007), the existing ratable\nvalue methodology is to be replaced by an area-based valuation methodology based on capital\nvalues. Property tax receipts are assumed to increase in real terms by 8-9 percent per annum to\n2006,  and  3.35  percent  per  annum  (the  midrange  growth  forecast)  thereafter.  Collection\nefficiency levels are assumed to increase from the current 60% level to 80% in FY2005.\n18. As part of its overall reform program, CMC is to implement flat rate user charges for all\npremises with a 20 mm diameter water supply connection or larger, and progressively introduce", "68\nAppendix 13, page 5\nstructured water tariffs in conjunction with a metering program. Introduction of computerized\nbilling and accounting systems should improve collection procedures and collection efficiency\nfor the consolidated rate charge. Water tariffs are assumed to increase in nominal terms by 15\npercent every two years with increases in connections reaching 1 million people in the project\narea in FY2007. Receipts generated from the provision of sewerage and drainage services over\nthe forecast period are those projected under the Project from a surcharge equivalent to 50\npercent of the water supply charge. Receipts generated from the SWM services over the\nforecast period are those projected under the Project from users fees for commercial customers.\n19. The State Finance Commission reforms will increase of the percentage of collected\ntaxes transferred from the state to local governments. The reforms will result in 16 percent of\nthe tax revenue collected by the state, net of the entertainment tax, being transferred to urban\nand local bodies. On the basis of the formula proposed by the commission, CMC\u2019s share will be\n3.8 percent. In addition the state has agreed to meet 100 percent of the cost-of-living allowance,\nand increase CMC\u2019s share of entertainment tax from 50 percent to 90 percent. Over the forecast\nperiod, the grant is assumed to increase in real terms at 1.0 percent per annum and in line with\nthe projected annual local inflation rate. The development grant transfer is received by CMC in\nlieu of the past octroi tax on goods and services imported into Calcutta municipality. Over the\nforecast period, the grant is assumed to increase at an annual rate of 3.35 percent, expressed\nin constant prices, plus the projected local inflation rate. It is assumed that CMC contracts out\nthe management of markets and devolves some of its responsibilities for health and education\nto nongovernment organizations and the state.\n20. The capital cost of the Project is financed in accordance with the proposed financing\nplan under the Project. The rehabilitation of canals is undertaken by the IWD. CMC will meet the\nsewerage  connection  costs  under  the  Project  and  then  recover  these  costs  through  the\nconsolidated rate charge system over 2-3 years.\n21. Sewerage  and  wastewater  services  are  regarded  as  revenue  generating,  therefore,\nthese components are financed by loans from the Government at a 13 percent interest rate and\na 25 year repayment period, with a 6 year grace period. The annual cost of debt service of the\nProject is financed according to the proposed financing plan.\n3. Cost Recovery Mechanisms\na. Sewerage and Drainage\n22. The drainage and wastewater collection system is under the management of CMC. The\nwater supply, sewerage, and drainage account of the municipal fund accounts for income,\ntransfers, and expenditures directly relating to the provision of water supply, sewerage, and\ndrainage services. At present, CMC\u2019s sewerage and drainage services depend almost entirely\non  CMC\u2019s  general  revenue  sources  from  consolidated  rate  charge  allocations,  and  state\ngovernment  grants.  Since  revenue  generation  from  consolidated  rate  charges  and  other\nsources has been extremely poor, CMC has been unable to provide satisfactory sewerage and\ndrainage services, with insufficient funds for O&M or capital investment. Users contribute little\ntoward drainage and sewerage costs. User fees for sewerage and drainage services are applied\nonly to industrial, commercial, and institutional (ICI) customers.", "69\nAppendix 13, page 6\n23. The proposed cost recovery mechanism for Calcutta\u2019s sewerage and drainage subsector\nis  the  implementation  of  a  two-part  fee  structure.  The  system  is  based  on  a  water  user\nsurcharge charge and the allocation of 15 percent of the consolidated rate charge collections to\ncover all recurrent operating costs and a proportion of debt service as well as future capital\nexpenditure for sewerage and drainage. Current direct user fees are to be reviewed, new tariffs\nestablished,  property  tax  reformed  and  collection  mechanisms  improved.  The  reforms  will\nprovide for the long-term financial sustainability of the sector.\n24.  Under the Project, user fees for water supply will be established for all ICI and domestic\nconsumers having a water connection, 20 mm diameter or greater. All such consumers will pay\na flat rate charge. Increases in tariffs will be slightly higher than the inflation rate during the\nimplementation  period.  As  meters  are  installed,  premises  will  pay  in  accordance  with  a\nstructured tariff.\n25. The consolidated rate charge allocated to sewerage and drainage constitutes an indirect\ncost recovery mechanism. Consolidated rate charge collection will increase significantly due to\nthe introduction of improved systems for tax billing and collection. This will substantially increase\nthe  amounts  dedicated  to  sewerage  and  drainage  service  maintenance  and  improvement.\nDirect and indirect user fees together will be sufficient to cover all O&M costs and debt service.\n26. The initial connection charge to the sewerage system will be about Rs6,000, depending\non the location of the house or premise. CMC is to initially shoulder this cost, and then recover it\nfrom users over a 2-3 year period. This financing mechanism will help to avoid delays in the\nconnections to the sewerage system.\n27. At present, in many cases each water or sewerage connection serves the needs of\nseveral households in a single premise. The available data shows that each water connection is\nserving approximately 10 people. Socioeconomic surveys show that each household has about\n4 people. This means that each connection is serving an average of 2.5 households. Assuming\nthe same ratio of 1 water connection and 1 sewerage connection for every 10 people, the\nProject will expand the number of sewerage connections to reach 100,000 in order to cover 60\npercent of the total population of the project area by FY2007.\nb. Solid Waste\n28. Cost recovery mechanisms will be established to assure long-term sustainability. An\nindirect cost recovery mechanism will be established through the consolidated rate charge\nsystem. CMC will establish a dedicated account for SWM. An amount equivalent to 15 percent\nof the consolidated rate charge collections will be transferred to this account and will be used\nexclusively for SWM. Fees will be charged to medical facilities and industries for the collection,\ntransportation, and treatment of biomedical and hazardous wastes.  Additional revenues will\nalso be obtained from recycling of compostable materials and charges for particular services.\n29. At the proposed level of fees and considering the expected increase in consolidated rate\ncharge collections, CMC will be able to recover all current and incremental O&M costs and meet\nits debt service after project completion. Because the main source of recovery from domestic\nconsumers will be the consolidated rate charge, the poorest sections of the population will not\nbe seriously affected, as they do not pay this charge.", "70\nAppendix 13, page 7\n4. Affordability and Willingness to Pay\n30. An analysis was undertaken to ensure that households, particularly those in the lower\nincome  groups  can  afford  the  proposed  sewerage  and  drainage  charges.  The  generally\naccepted guidelines are that the combined fees charged for water and sanitation, and SWM\nshould not exceed 6 percent of the household income. On this basis, the charge for sewerage\nand  drainage  should  not  be  greater  than  2.5  percent.  The  direct  user  fees  proposed  for\ndomestic consumers will represent 1.3 percent of the median household income (Rs3,700 per\nmonth in 1999) and 1.9 percent for the low-income household (Rs2,670 per month) in the year\nFY2002. Projections indicate that the direct user fees will not exceed more than 2 percent to\nFY2010. The consolidated rate charge is also used as an indirect cost recovery mechanism.\nThe average consolidated rate charge payment is around Rs4000 per year (based on Rs1.5\nbillion estimate of current assessments for the whole CMC). From this amount, 15 percent is to\nbe allocated to sewerage and drainage services. This represents Rs600 yearly or Rs50 monthly\nfor the average household. This is equivalent to 1.3 percent of the median household income\nand 1.9 percent of income for the low-income households.\n31. The sum of both direct and indirect user charges represents 2.6 percent of the median\nhousehold income and 3.8 percent of the low-income households. On this basis, the proposed\nfee levels are considered to be affordable for the median income households. Most low-income\nhouseholds will not pay the consolidated rate charge, or will pay an amount much lower than\nRs4,000 per year. This will represent a cross-subsidy mechanism from the wealthier to the\npoorer segments of the population. The socioeconomic analysis found that 90 percent of the\nhouseholds were willing to pay Rs50 per month for these services.\n32. For SWM the indirect fees collected though the 15 percent allocation of the consolidated\nrate charge will also represent 1.3 percent of the income of median income households. Poor\nhouseholds will not be affected by the tariff for the same reasons as in the sewerage and\ndrainage component.\n5. Financial Evaluation of CMC\n33. Detailed financial projections are prepared for the FY2000-2012 period on the basis of\nthe  assumptions  set  out  above,  the  proposed  cost  recovery  mechanisms,  the  proposed\noperational requirements, and the population forecast and planning targets. The projections\nshow that CMC\u2019s financial position improves over the forecast period. CMC is able to make a\ncapital contribution to funding the Project, meet its ongoing operating costs, and also meet the\ndebt servicing of the funds relent from the state government. Loan relending terms assume a 25\nyear repayment period, including a 6 year grace period, at a 13 percent interest rate. By the\ncompletion of the Project in FY2007, property taxes will represent 30 percent of CMC\u2019s revenue\nbase, user fees for water supply and sewerage 18 percent, and state entitlements 44 percent.\nWhile projections result in deficits in FY2000, 2001, and 2002, CMC will generate overall\nsurpluses from FY2003 due to increases in property tax and user charges and reforms to state\ntaxes transferred to CMC. These improvements allow CMC to meet its capital contribution to the\nProject and meet the debt service on the ADB loan (from FY2008)."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20010212105608", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Author": "jm9", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R259-00rrp.doc", "ModDate": "D:20010213113830+08'00'"}}
