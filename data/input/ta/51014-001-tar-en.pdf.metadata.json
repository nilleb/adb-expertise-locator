INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  proposed  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the \nstrengthening of the \u201criver chief system\u201d and improve river health in the Yangtze River Economic \nBelt (YREB) in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).1 The TA will assist the Yangtze (also known \nas Changjiang) Water Resources Commission (CWRC), a river basin authority under the Ministry \nof Water Resources of the PRC, to improve the monitoring, supervision, and evaluation of the \nriver chief system, and the coordination mechanism among the provinces, for effective application \nof the system in the Yangtze River basin.2 \n \n2.  Given that the PRC\u2019s water and ecological status remains fragile and the environmental \nsafety situation is grim, the State Council of the PRC recently formulated a strategy to improve \nriver health conditions and ecological safety.3 The strategy statement implies the identification of \necological thresholds and their calibration in all ecologically fragile regions nationwide by 2020. \nThe strategy has prioritized the regions, including the YREB, with important ecological functions. \nRecently,  the  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection,  the  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission,  and  the Ministry  of Water  Resources  jointly  released  a  YREB  environmental \nprotection plan to complement the national strategy on river health and ecological safety.4 The \nGovernment  of  the  PRC  requested  a  TA  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for \nstrengthening the application of the river chief system, which becomes fundamental for effective \nimplementation  of  the  environmental  protection  plan  and  sustainable  water  resources \nmanagement in the YREB. The TA is included in the country operations business plan for the \nPRC, 2017\u20132019.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The government has identified the YREB as one of the three key growth engines in \nensuring the PRC\u2019s future economic development. The YREB comprises nine provinces (Anhui, \nGuizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Zhejiang) and two centrally \nadministered municipalities (Chongqing and Shanghai). It covers over 2 million square kilometers \nalong the Yangtze River\u2014one-fifth of the country\u2019s total area. The YREB, as the country\u2019s \neconomic backbone, accounts for over 40% of the PRC\u2019s total population and about 45% of the \ngross domestic product. The Yangtze River basin has high biodiversity, including more than 370 \nfish species, 100 species of aquatic plants, and 145 species of amphibians. The river provides \n40% of the PRC\u2019s freshwater resources, serves as the source of drinking water for over 400 \nmillion people, accounts for 20% of the total wetland areas in the PRC, and nurtures 60% of the \ntotal fishery resources across the country.  \n \n                                                \n1   In 2016, the State Council of the PRC designated the heads of local governments (provincial, municipal, and county \nor township) as river chiefs who are accountable for the management and protection of watercourses, as well as for \nrestoring water ecology, in their jurisdictions. River chiefs will report progress to the central government annually. C. \nJiwen. 2017. River Chief System: Legal Basis and Practical Problems.

The TA was listed \nunder the nonlending products and services as the Study on Water Ecosystem Safety Guarantee System of Yangtze \nRiver Economic Belt.  \n ", "2 \n4.  Rapid economic development and urbanization in the YREB region, including expansion \nof resource-intensive industries, has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, particularly \ndegradation of the ecological system. In 2014, the water quality of 23% of the total measured \nsections of the Yangtze River was rated at class IV and below.6 Improper management and \nutilization of riparian resources has negative implications for aquatic habitat. More than 51,200 \nartificial reservoirs with dams of various sizes, and sediment extraction of over 100 million tons \nannually from the river, have resulted in changed flow patterns and affected drainage connectivity \nto varying extents. However, these regulated reservoirs help mitigate flood and drought disasters \nin the downstream locations by optimizing the water volume.  \n \n5.  For large rivers that span regions, river chiefs will be responsible for coordinating the \nmanagement of interlinked bodies of water. Responsibilities of the river chiefs include water \nresource  protection,  pollution  prevention  and  control,  and  ecological  restoration. 7  These \nadministrative approaches have proven effective in the pilot projects, including in the Chishui \nRiver basin in the YREB, but the constructive evaluation and supervision system is yet to be \ndeveloped and made operational nationwide.8 Institutional capacity, legal support, technical \ncapacity, and public awareness need to be further strengthened to rationalize the system. There \nis  also  a  need  to  understand  the  diversity  of  the  basin  within  its  wide  range  of  natural, \nsocioeconomic, administrative, and cultural landscapes. Further, there is a need to synergize the \nriver chief system within existing institutional structures and establish proper links to recent \nnational initiatives, including the YREB master plan and environmental protection plan. \n \n6.  The Chishui River, a major tributary of the upper Yangtze River, originates in Yunnan \nprovince and flows through Guizhou and Sichuan provinces into the Yangtze River mainstream. \nThe counties in the Chishui River basin are relatively poor. The river chief system in the Chishui \nRiver was piloted in Guizhou province in 2012 and has since been extended into a basin-wide \nprogram. Given the fact that the Chishui River basin is ecologically sensitive, spans three \nprovinces, has low rates of urbanization, and has a relatively underdeveloped economy, it is \nconsidered as a model representation for ecological protection and restoration. Implementing the \nriver chief system has resulted in initial improvements in ecological function and river health in \nthe Chishui River basin. However, there is a need to develop indicators and methodologies for \nmonitoring and evaluation to better quantify ecological and river health improvements. There is a \nneed to strengthen the existing mechanism for coordination among provinces in the river basin \nfor effective application of the river chief system. The outcomes from the Chishui River basin can \nprovide a baseline for application of the river chief system and its performance evaluation to be \nadopted in the YREB. In the context of the river chief system being applied nationwide as a new \napproach to river management, the function and role of the CWRC in integrated river basin \nmanagement,  including  Chishui  River  basin  management,  can  be  reinforced  rather  than \nundermined to avoid any potential fragmentation with individual sub-basins. \n \n                                                \n6  Up to class III water is suitable for drinking and swimming as per the PRC\u2019s Environmental Water Quality Standard \n(GB 3838-2002). In the Yangtze River basin, the volume of domestic waste water has increased by 59% since 2003; \nabout 40,000 chemical companies have been established; and agricultural waste, particularly the manure discharged \ninto the river, has increased about 10 fold from 156 kilograms per square kilometer between 1970 and 2016. \n7  The guidelines on the river chief system disclosed by the State Council of the PRC outline six main tasks: (i) \nstrengthening water resources protection, (ii) enhancing riverbank management and protecting water bodies, (iii) \nstrengthening water pollution control, (iv) improving water environment governance, (v) promoting water ecological \nrehabilitation, and (vi) enhancing law enforcement and supervision. The Ministry of Water Resources highlights four \nmajor responsibilities for the CWRC: coordination, guidance, supervision, and monitoring. \n8   Z.  Jinran.  2017.  Assessment  to  ensure  river  chief  system  on  schedule.  China  Daily  Asia.  22  March. \nhttp://www.chinadailyasia.com/nation/2017-03/22/content_15589721.html. \n ", "3 \n7.  The TA supports the government\u2019s efforts to strengthen river governance, particularly the \nriver chief system. The TA will mainly support the development of river health monitoring and \nevaluation methods and tools, which are prerequisites for the effective application of the river \nchief system in the YREB. The TA will foster synergies in promoting ecological civilization, with \nexplicit targets specified in the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020.9 In September 2016, \nthe National Development and Reform Commission issued the YREB Master Plan, 2016\u20132030 to \nguide future development of the YREB toward the overarching goal of ecological restoration and \ngreen development.10 The plan sets targets for ecological environment: (i) by 2020, (a) over 75% \nof the region's water bodies will meet class III standard or above, and (b) forest coverage will \nreach 43%; and (ii) by 2030, (a) all water bodies will achieve class III quality standard, and (b) \necosystem function will be significantly enhanced. Since 2016, the government has started \nimplementing the river chief system nationwide. The TA will be timely in demonstrating the new \nbenchmarks for the implementation of the policies, strategies, and action plans in the YREB. \n \n8.  This TA builds on a number of previous ADB engagements in water sector reform in the \nPRC.11 ADB has put knowledge at the center of its operations in the PRC by (i) helping translate \ninnovative  ideas  into  actual  projects  and  programs  for  implementation,  (ii)  supporting \ntransformative and demonstration projects and programs, and (iii) supporting institutional reform \nefforts. Specifically, ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020 also calls for \nmanaging climate change and the environment, fostering knowledge cooperation, and supporting \ninstitutional and governance reform.12 The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Water Operational \nPlan,  2011\u20132020,  which  emphasizes  integrated  water  resources  management  and  climate \nchange adaptation.13 The government and ADB are proposing a strategic framework to support \ngreen development, with emphasis on ecological conservation through environmental protection \nand rehabilitation of the YREB (footnote 9). Support for river governance, particularly in successful \nimplementation of the river chief system, will serve as an anchor for future engagement in water \nsector development and inclusion in the PRC. \n \nIII.

Output 2: Monitoring mechanism for the river chief system demonstrated in the \nChishui River basin. Under this output, the following activities will be conducted: (i) gathering \nand  documenting  good  practices  and  approaches  in  river  health  monitoring  for  potential \nadaptation and application in the Chishui River basin; (ii) piloting a set of monitoring indicators \nand methodologies for the river chief system, including a river health report card; and (iii) \nformulating a proposal for improving the coordination mechanism between the CWRC and \nprovinces in the basin for river health under the river chief system.16 \n \n12.  Output 3: Implementation of the river chief system in the Yangtze River Economic \nBelt promoted. Under this output, the following activities will be conducted: (i) formulating policy \nrecommendations for implementing the Chishui River Comprehensive Plan,17 (ii) formulating \nrecommendations for applying the river chief system with monitoring provisions and harmonizing \nthe system with integrated river basin management in the YREB based on the lessons from the \nChishui River case study, and (iii) disseminating TA outcomes. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2.  \n \n14.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace, office supplies, domestic transportation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months from 1 October 2017 to 30 September 2019. \nADB will administer the TA. The Ministry of Water Resources of the PRC will provide policy and \ninstitutional support for TA implementation. The CWRC, as the executing agency, will establish a \nproject leading group, chaired by the vice-commissioner of the CWRC, which will be responsible \nfor the overall planning, coordination, and supervision of the TA implementation. The project \nleading group will comprise members from bureaus of construction management; planning and \ndesign;  water  resources;  soil  conservation;  water  resources  protection;  hydrology;  and  the \nChangjiang Institute of Survey, Planning, Design, and Research. A project management unit will \nbe established in the CWRC\u2019s Bureau of International Cooperation, Science, and Technology. \nThe project management unit, with a unit head, project officer, and administrative staff, will \nsupervise (i) the TA activities to be carried out by the project consultants; and (ii) day-to-day \n                                                \n16 The report card, an application of river health indicators, identifies what is important to the ecological services, creates \na common understanding of the sub-basin\u2019s health, and fosters a shared vision for its future. Each river health \nindicator is indexed to summarize and rank specific observations. The weighted mean of those indices under different \nsets of indicators result in a composite index, known as a river health report card, to represent the river health quality \nof any river section. The river health report card is a good tool to evaluate the performance of the river chief system. \n17 The YWRC has drafted eight comprehensive river basin development plans for the first-class sub-basins, including \nthe Chishui River basin in the Yangtze River basin. The know-how from the case study is equally important to improve \nall comprehensive river basin development plans in the YREB, including those prepared by local governments. \n ", "5 \noperations with ADB, consultants, related agencies, and provincial governments. The project \nmanagement unit will serve as secretariat for the project leading group.

The TA will require 3 person-months of international and 27 person-\nmonths of national consulting services. Six national consultants and two international consultants \nwill be required for TA implementation. The consultants will be engaged as individual consultants \nin accordance with ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the \nassociated project administration instructions and TA staff instructions. This is considered the \nmost efficient method as the consultants will be supervised by ADB in close coordination with the \nexecuting agency. Disbursements will be in line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). It is anticipated that the consultants will be \nmobilized during the fourth quarter of 2017. \n \n17.  The  TA  will  follow  the  standard  monitoring  and  supervision  procedures  for  ADB- \nadministered TA. Best practices and lessons will be disseminated through technical workshops \nand through various technical reports, knowledge products, and other publications to be posted \non the CWRC and ADB websites. \n \n18.  To ensure effective and efficient coordination among the CWRC, provincial governments, \nand line agencies, an inception phase is scheduled during which the consultation and coordination \nmechanisms will be discussed among the CWRC, ADB, and consultants. A consultation and work \nplan will be agreed upon prior to contacting the provincial governments and line agencies. The \nfinal agreements will be discussed and agreed during the TA inception workshop. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n19.
