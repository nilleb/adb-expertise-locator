THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Facilitating Youth School-to-Work Transition Program, and (ii) a \nproposed policy-based loan to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 1 of the Facilitating \nYouth School-to-Work Transition Program.1 \n \n2.  The program supports the government\u2019s efforts to roll out new innovative labor market \nprograms  that  aim  to  shorten  young  Filipino\u2019s  school-to-work  transition  and  raise  youth \nemployment rates, and represents a long-term partnership between the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and the government.2 The government\u2019s priorities include (i) labor market programs made \nto work better for youth, (ii) training systems made to work better for youth, and (iii) labor market \npolicies improved for the benefit of youth. The program is included in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan, 2017\u20132019.3 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The development problem. The Philippines enjoyed strong economic growth between \n2010 and 2016, averaging 6.3% per annum. This translated into solid job creation with wage \nemployment expanding by an average of 3.7% per annum over this period and the overall \nunemployment rate falling to a historically low 4.7% by October 2016. While impressive, these \ngains have not been evenly distributed throughout the population. Overall poverty rates have \ndeclined only marginally to 21.6% in 2015 from 26.3% in 2009 and income inequality persists. 4  \nThe Philippines has the highest household income inequality among all the Southeast Asian \neconomies. The Gini index, which measures a country\u2019s household income inequality, is high at \n0.46 and is explained in part by unequal access to wage employment.5  \n \n4.  The Philippines has a young population with an average age of 25 years. Therefore, \ncreating wage jobs for youth is vital to reducing poverty and income inequality. The signs are \nencouraging. Reflecting new investments in services, skill shortages have arisen in the fast-\ngrowing business process outsourcing industry, financial and business services, and, most \nrecently, in higher value-added manufacturing.6 \n \n5.  Yet, the Philippines has a youth employment problem. Based on findings from an ADB \nsurvey of 500 households in Metro Manila and Cebu City, only 20% of high school graduates \nfound a job within the first year of leaving school and only 60% of high school graduates were in \nemployment 8 years after leaving school.7 In contrast, 75% of college graduates found a job within \nthe first year of leaving school. As a result of this slow school-to-work transition, one in four young \npersons (25%) was not in employment, education, or training (NEET) in 2013, a rate in Southeast \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Youth is defined in the Philippine law as ages 15\u201330.  \n3  ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: Philippines, 2017\u20132019. Manila. \n4  Government of the Philippines, National Statistics Office. 2014. Annual Poverty Indicator Survey. Manila. \n5  According to the 2013 Philippines labor force survey, only 37% of total wage workers reside in households in the \nbottom half of the income distribution.  \n6  PhilJobNet, a Department of Labor and Employment job vacancy database. http://philjobnet.gov.ph (7 March 2017). \n7  Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). ", "2 \nAsia second only to Indonesia\u2019s.8 This rate is higher for young women (one in three) than for \nyoung men (one in five), because young women are more likely to withdraw from the labor market \nentirely (Figure 1a). Young women with low education attainment are most at risk of becoming \nNEET (one in two women), in part due to earlier childbearing and child-rearing than women with \ncollege education (Figure 1b). The rate of NEET is also highest among youth from low-income \nfamilies, as they tend to be less educated, do not have quality social contacts, and do not have \nthe life skills required to find long-term wage employment. This mismatch is occurring because \nthe participation rates of the poor in education are low, labor market activation programs are weak \nand under-resourced, and skills training programs are underfunded and not targeted. In addition, \nmen and women with low educational attainment and early spells in NEET are likely to have low \nlifetime earnings. ADB study shows that the rates of return on schooling have declined for wage \nworkers  from  low-income  households  and  increased  for  wage  workers  from  high  income \nhouseholds perpetuating income inequality (footnote 7). \n \nFigure 1: Not in Employment, Education, or Training\u2014 \nRates by Gender, Education Level, and Age \n \n(% of total population group) \n  \n%  a.

The findings imply that policy interventions will be necessary to complement investments \nin the education of young persons from lower-income groups to reduce income inequality. \nInterventions should focus on lifting the poor\u2019s rate of participation in education and improving the \nquality of public education in poorer areas and helping young people access skills training and \nemployment facilitation services at the local government unit (LGU) to become job-ready. \n \n7.  Binding constraints. The government has identified a number of constraints to facilitating \nthe  youth  school-to-work  transition,  including:  (i)  inadequate  employment  facilitation;  \n(ii) weaknesses in post-high school training systems; and (iii) insufficient labor policies to promote \ndecent employment (paras. 8\u201310). \n \n8.  Inadequate employment facilitation services. The public employment service offices \n(PESOs) are critically important for ensuring the effective implementation of active labor market \nprograms in LGUs and for achieving job placement targets. Five main impediments affect effective \nemployment facilitation in the Philippines. First, while the Philippines has established a network \nof PESOs through legislation enacted in 1999, the institutionalization of PESOs at the LGU level \nremains voluntary, underfunded, and under-resourced. Less than 300 out of 1,500 PESOs in 2014 \n                                                \n8  The most recent aggregated data from the Labor Force Survey for 2016 shows a decline in overall NEET rate to \n22% of the youth population.  \n ", "3 \nhave been institutionalized at the LGU level with permanent staff and budget, and this impedes \nthe delivery of employment facilitation to youth requiring these services. Moreover, youth in rural \nareas do not have access to basic employment services. Second, international best practice \nshows that effective youth employment programs are employer demand-driven and provide an \nintegrated set of services to youth.9 In the Philippines, current labor market programs do not offer \na full cycle of employment facilitation services targeted at youth, and especially young women, \nsuch as career guidance, life skills training, technical training, and internships or placements with \nemployers. The government does have youth employment programs, which mainly focus on \nscholarships and training. However, these programs have design weaknesses that limit the \npotential for further scaling up nationally.10 For example, the government\u2019s Special Program for \nthe Employment of Students (SPES) requires LGUs to contribute 25%\u201360% of the cost of the \nprogram, irrespective of their fiscal capacity.11 Third, employment programs are not effectively \ntargeting young women with high school or lower education despite this group being most at risk \nof gaining NEET status. For example, there are no quotas set for women beneficiaries in SPES \nand the Government Internship Program (GIP) contributing to underrepresentation of young \nwomen  in  these  programs  (footnote  11).  Fourth,  several  line  departments  and  agencies \nimplement labor market activation programs in an uncoordinated manner, therefore, limiting the \npotential  for  synergies  in  a  cost-effective  way.  Recent  international  good  practice  is  to \namalgamate  similar  programs  under  the  relevant  line  department.  Fifth,  the  labor  market \ninformation system (LMIS) needs upgrading to capture a larger pool of vacancies, skills, and \nbetter outreach to youth nationally and in local communities. \n \n9.  Weakness in post-high school training systems. A deficient apprenticeship program \nand insufficient funding for workplace skills have resulted in underinvestment in skills training of \nworkers and jobseekers. For example, a 2015 ADB survey found that 80% of employers in tourism \ndo not have a training policy for their employees.12 While the Philippines has established a good \ninstitutional setup for technical and vocational education and training (TVET), the development of \nan  integrated  Philippine  Qualifications  Framework  (PQF)  is  still  in  its  early  stages  of \nimplementation with basic education under the Department of Education, technical and vocational \neducation under the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA), and higher \neducation under the Commission for Higher Education.A coordination board, supported by a \npresidential executive order, has been established to facilitate an integrated PQF, but it has not \nbeen fully operationalized. The Philippines apprenticeship program and the dual training system \nare important mechanisms for skills development and addressing the slow transition to work. \nHowever,  take-up  of  the  programs  by  youth  and  employers  is  low  with  only  28,000  new \napprentices in 2015. Apprenticeships are limited to 6 months; there is no certification process, \nand the inadequate involvement of industry associations in the design of apprenticeship programs \nexplains this poor take-up of apprenticeships. For funding of skills in the workplace, TESDA has \na skills fund but it has not been activated and other TESDA funding schemes have been \nimplemented on an ad hoc basis and are not driven by employer demand. \n \n10.  Insufficient  labor  policies  to  promote  decent  employment.  The  government  is \ncommitted to creating decent employment for young people and has identified a set of constraints \nto achieving this goal. First, there is a need to promote and incentivize employer compliance with \nlabor  standards  including  occupational  safety  and  health.  Second,  the  Philippines  dispute \n                                                \n9  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 2013. OECD Employment Outlook 2013. Paris. \n10 Labor Market  Programs in the Philippines (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 SPES offers poor students financial support through 3 month internships aimed at keeping them in education. From \n2010 to 2013, SPES had assisted 493,742 poor students, of which 42.5% were women. GIP provides college \nstudents with internships in government. From 2012 to 2015, the GIP assisted 34,625 college students. \n12 ADB. 2015. Tourism Employment and Skills Needs in the Philippines: Projections to 2018. Manila. \n ", "4 \nresolution  process  is  highly  litigious  leading  to  an  excessively  lengthy  and  costly  dispute \nsettlement process. This has deterred many employers from hiring youth on a regular contract. \nTo address this problem, the government piloted a 30-day mandatory conciliation\u2013mediation \nservice for all labor and employment disputes, known as the Single Entry Approach (SEnA), with \nthe goal to resolve the dispute in 30 days. Following positive results from the pilot, legislation was \nenacted in 2013 institutionalizing SEnA. Effective implementation of the reform is critical to \nreducing the cost of disputes. Third, there is no unemployment insurance to provide temporary \nincome security during a worker\u2019s job-to-job transition. \n \n11.  Government reform agenda. The government\u2019s Philippine Development Plan, 2017\u2013\n2022  has  prioritized  youth  employment.  The  government\u2019s  approach  to  employment  is \ncategorized into three pillars: (i) education and skills development, (ii) job creation, and (iii) labor \nmarket activation. Under the first pillar, the main ongoing reform is the K to 12 program, which \nprovides high school graduates with the skills necessary to find jobs. By adding 2 years to high \nschool, the K to12 reforms will help to accelerate the school-to-work transition for many youths. \nHowever, international experience shows basic education reforms alone will not be sufficient to \nassist all out-of-school youth to integrate into the labor market. Further education and training and \nlabor  market  activation  programs  will  be  necessary.  The  government  is  also  looking  at \nstrengthening the TVET system by promoting an integrated qualifications and quality assurance \nframework, reforming the apprenticeship system, and looking at new ways to fund skills training \nin the workplace. Under the job-creation pillar, priority interventions are a national competition \npolicy, investment climate reforms, capital market development, and increased public and private \ninvestment in infrastructure. Under the labor market activation pillar, the government\u2019s strategy is \nto restructure the PESOs, reform active labor market programs, roll out new services to assist \nout-of-school youth and the unemployed, and link these services together to achieve better \nimpact.  \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s experience. ADB has supported government reforms to promote employment \ncreation through loan programs, investment project loans, technical assistance (TA) grants, and \nknowledge products (Figure 2). In the 1990s, ADB was instrumental in the establishment of \nTESDA and other supply side initiatives around TVET. Most recent programs include the Senior \nHigh School Support Program Loan, 2014\u20132019, which supports the government\u2019s K to 12 \nprogram.13 Since 2011, ADB has supported the government\u2019s employment facilitation agenda \nthrough the Increasing Competitiveness for Inclusive Growth Program, 2011\u20132014 and two large \nTA projects financed by the Government of Canada.14 These TA projects helped the government \nto successfully pilot the JobStart Philippines Program (JSP) in four LGUs, pilot a workplace skills \nfunding scheme in tourism, and carry out impact assessments on several main labor regulations \nand programs (Apprenticeship, SPES and PESOs) helping lay the analytical foundations for the \nprogram.15 An ADB capacity development TA, also financed by the Government of Canada for \n$7.5  million,  was  approved  in  October  2015  and  will  help  the  Department  of  Labor  and \nEmployment (DOLE) establish the institutional setup for the nationwide rollout of JSP, provide \ncapacity development to PESOs as well as the LMIS that will support this rollout, and fund life \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2014.

Lessons learned from experience. Addressing the out-of-school youth employment \nproblem requires a comprehensive strategy covering labor market activation programs, skills \ntraining for out-of-school youth, labor market policies that improve youth access to employment, \nand effective gender mainstreaming of programs. A second lesson is that pilot projects testing \nnew strategies are an important part of policy development and building stakeholder support for \ninstitutional reforms. A third lesson is that there should be strong government ownership and \nwidespread political will. Developing and designing programs in close collaboration with the \ngovernment and other key stakeholders is critical to the successful implementation of activities \nand for the achievement of policy measures. Based on these lessons, ADB is taking an integrated \napproach  to  youth  employment  with  the  program,  extensively  engaging  with  stakeholders, \nelecting key representatives to a national program steering committee, and focusing program \nimplementation at the LGU level.19 \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s value added to the program design and implementation. ADB has provided \ndirect support to the development of this program and its reforms. Under the TA to DOLE \n(footnotes 14 and 16), ADB helped to design, develop, and pilot the JSP and is currently \nsupporting the nationwide rollout of the JSP. ADB has helped DOLE enhance its LMIS which \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2015.

Under the TA to the Department of Tourism (DOT) (footnote 14), ADB \nsupported the design, development, and piloting of a tourism skills funding scheme. Through \nADB\u2019s regulatory impact assessment program, assistance was provided for the review and draft \namendments to reform the PESO Act, SPES Act, and the Apprenticeship Act. ADB is assisting \nthe government design an enterprise-led learning network scheme that would provide grants to \nclusters of employers to fund short-term skills training of their employees and jobseekers.  While \ncurrently not included in the program, the TA also helped DOLE examine options for developing \nan unemployment insurance scheme.  \n \n15.  The results have been impressive. In 2015, the government enacted a new PESO Act that \nmandates the institutionalization of PESOs and secures budget funding. In 2016, the government \nenacted reforms to the SPES Act that provides a wage subsidy to poor students and enacted the \nAct Institutionalizing the Nationwide Implementation of the JobStart Philippines Program and \nProviding Funds Thereof (JSP Act) to institutionalize the JSP and ensure the program\u2019s financial \nsustainability. The government also submitted to Congress amendments to the Apprenticeship \nAct. In 2016, the JSP had been rolled out to 14 cities and municipalities in Luzon, Visayas, and \nMindanao. An additional 10 LGUs will join the JSP each year from 2017 to 2020. The DOT is also \nrolling  out  its  industry  skills  funding  scheme.  The  government  has  included  the  proposed \nenterprise-led learning network scheme as a program in the Philippine Development Plan, 2017\u2013\n2022.  \n \n16.  The programmatic approach and policy-based loan. ADB chose the programmatic \napproach  through  a  policy-based  loan  over  other  financing  modalities  to  help  sustain  the \ngovernment\u2019s reforms and financing to lift youth wage employment rates over the long term. The \nprogrammatic approach will also leverage the government budget in support of these reforms to \nensure sustainability. The program will comprise two subprograms covered by a medium-term \nresults framework, reflecting continuous engagement between ADB and the government on youth \nemployment. A third subprogram is optional, and its implementation is based on the government\u2019s \nrequest. A project investment may be considered during subprogram 2 formulation. \n \n17.  Development partner coordination. The Government of Canada has been instrumental \nin the development and support of the program, funding three large TA projects (footnotes 14 and \n16). Pilots developed under these TA projects are now being rolled out nationally. ADB worked \nwith the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to jointly develop a youth \nemployment and skills report in 2016.20 ADB is also collaborating with the World Association of \nPublic  Employment  Services  in  support  of  capacity  development  of  the  PESOs.  Other \ndevelopment agencies that are involved in supporting this agenda include the International Labour \nOrganization,  which  is  helping  with  policy  development  and  the  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development, assisting with industry road maps.  \n \n18.  Economic impact of the program.  The three outputs of the program together are \nexpected to increase the number of youth employed with higher earnings and in more productive \njobs. Potential economic gains are to be achieved through (i) reform of employment facilitation \nthat increases the placement rates of out-of-school youth into jobs with higher earnings, and (ii) \nefficiency gains from the development of public\u2013private partnerships in implementing labor market \nand skills programs at the local government level (para. 27). \n                                                \n20 ADB and OECD. Forthcoming. OECD Reviews on Local Job Creation Employment and Skills Strategies in the \nPhilippines.OECD Publishing, Paris.  \n ", "7 \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n19.  The impact will be increased wage employment rate for the country\u2019s youth. The outcome \nwill be a shortened school-to-work transition period for youth. The program will include a series \nof policy reforms and interventions to raise the youth employment rate and is designed to deliver \nthree outputs. All 14 policy measures under subprogram 1 (January 2015\u2013October 2016) have \nbeen accomplished. Subprogram 2 will include 7 prior expected actions and 8 policy milestones.21 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n20.  Output 1: Labor market programs made to work better for youth. This output will \nsupport the government\u2019s efforts to restructure its PESO and labor market activation programs \nand roll out new services to assist the youth to find decent employment. Accomplishments under \nsubprogram 1 include the following: in 2015, the government enacted amendments to the PESO \nAct, which now mandates the institutionalization of PESOs in LGUs, secures budgetary funding \nthrough the internal revenue allocation, and sets minimum service standards. In support of this \nreform, the government commenced capacity development of LGUs and allocated national \ngovernment funding for this purpose. The government (through DOLE) also commenced the \nimplementation of its new LMIS, which includes an upgraded national skills registry, PhilJobNet \nand PEIS. In the area of labor market activation, the government introduced two major reforms. \nThe first reform is the institutionalization of the JSP. The government enacted legislation that \nmandates the rollout of the program to all LGUs, secures national government budget funding for \nthe program\u2014including grants to employers for taking on youth\u2014life skills training, and develops \ncapacity of PESOs. In support of this reform, DOLE signed memorandums of understanding with \n14 LGUs to implement JSP in 2016 and the first round of youth intakes was completed. The JSP \nhas mainstreamed gender considerations. Life skills training incorporate modules on young \nwomen health and reproductive health, and a minimum quota of 55.0% of all JSP beneficiaries \nmust be women. The second major reform was to amend the SPES  Act with the aim of \nstrengthening its design and scale-up. A key reform was to provide poor students with a wage \nsubsidy of which the LGU\u2019s share would be based on its fiscal capacity. \n \n21.  For  subprogram  2  (November  2016\u2013March  2019),  the  government  will  focus  on \nimplementing  reforms  with  quantitative  targets  to  demonstrate  results  and  impact.  Under \nsubprogram 2, 800 PESOs will be institutionalized with permanent staff and budget, capacity \ndevelopment  and  LMIS,  34  LGUs  implementing  JSP  reaching  at  least  15,000  cumulative \nbeneficiaries, minimum quotas for young women participating in JSP and SPES, and sufficient \nbudget allocations to PESOs and programs. Subprogram 2 will support the government in \nrationalizing  existing  employment  and  training  programs,  and  implement  a  monitoring  and \nevaluation system for all employment programs to allow for evidence-based improvement to \nprograms. The government will also develop concept and plans for the establishment of a job \ncenter at the national level as a one-stop center for capacity building to PESO staff.  \n \n22.  Output 2: Training systems made to work better for youth. This output supports the \ngovernment\u2019s reforms to give young people better access to workplace skills development by \nstrengthening the PQF, reforming the apprenticeship program, and partnering with employers for \nskills development. Accomplishments under subprogram 1 included the following. First, the \ngovernment  (through  TESDA)  enhanced  the  PQF  by  implementing  the  higher  level  TVET \nqualifications (National Certificate III to National Certificate V-Diploma) linked to core competency \nneeds of local industries and adopted TVET quality assurance instruments such as the STAR \n                                                \n21 Prior expected actions are considered disbursement conditions and policy milestones strengthen the program. \n ", "8 \nRating System, the Asia Pacific Accreditation Certification Commission, and the East Asia Summit \nTVET Quality Assurance Framework. Second, the government (through TESDA) submitted to \nCongress  draft  amendments  to  the  Apprenticeship  Act  system  to  set  the  duration  of \napprenticeships based on skills needed, include certification of apprentices and curriculum with a \nmix  of  academic-based  learning  and  workplace  and  occupational  training,  and  make  the \ndevelopment of apprenticeship programs industry-driven. Third, the government enacted the \nRepublic Act 10771, the Philippine Green Jobs Act of 2016, to provide incentives to business \nenterprises that generate and sustain green jobs. Fourth, the government, through DOLE and in \ncoordination  with  industry  groups  and  TESDA,  developed  sector-based  human  resources \ndevelopment action plans in tourism, information and communications technology, manufacturing, \nand agribusiness. The tourism action plan is further advanced and included the creation of the \nOffice  of  Industry  Manpower  Development  with  designated  staff  and  budget,  and  the \nestablishment of the tourism skills training grant scheme. \n \n23.  For  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  focus  on  institutionalizing  reforms  such  as \nsubmitting to Congress a bill to institutionalize the PQF and coordinating body and development. \nThe government will also lead the roll-out of the employer-led learning network and training grants \nin tourism and other sectors with promising employment prospects identified by the industry road \nmaps.  Subprogram  2  will  also  implement  reforms  to  the  dual  training  system  and  the \napprenticeship program and start a call for apprenticeship program proposals from industry \ngroups.  \n \n24.  Output 3: Labor market policies improved for the benefit of youth. This output will \nsupport the government\u2019s agenda to promote decent employment. Under subprogram 1, the \ngovernment implemented its new legislated mandatory 30-day conciliation\u2013mediation mechanism \n(SEnA) for resolving unfair dismissal disputes. As of 2015, 108,234 cases were resolved under \nthe SEnA mechanism, thereby reducing the number of cases going through arbitration. For \nsubprogram 2, the government will continue to implement the new SEnA mechanism and explore \nadditional reforms to promote its decent employment agenda such as unemployment insurance. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n25.  The government has requested a regular loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such \nother terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the annuity method \n(30% discount factor), the average maturity is 12 years and there is no maturity premium payable \nto ADB. The loan proceeds will be used to finance foreign exchange of economy-wide imports, \nexcluding ineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The \nproceeds of the policy-based loan will be disbursed upon effectiveness in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time).   \n \n26.  In 2017, the gross development financing needs is planned at $12.6 billion with a budget \ndeficit projected at 3.0% of GDP. The government plans to raise $10.1 billion equivalent primarily \nfrom the domestic bond market and $2.6 billion from foreign loans, of which $1.4 billion is program \nloans from development partners. The loan size is based on the financing needs of the Philippines, \nthe strength of the reform program, and the development expenditures arising from the program \nsuch as national government budget allocations to scale up employment programs (para. 28). \n \n \n ", "9 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n27.  The Department of Finance (DOF) will be the executing agency. DOLE, TESDA, DOT, \nDepartment  of  Trade  and  Industry,  and  LGUs  (through  PESOs),  will  be  the  implementing \nagencies. A steering committee will oversee implementation, chaired by the DOF, with the \nimplementing  agencies  and  the  National  Economic  and  Development  Authority  and  the \nDepartment of Budget and Management as members. Other stakeholders from employers and \nyouth groups will participate from time to time. The implementation periods are January 2015\u2013\nOctober 2016 for subprogram 1 and November 2016\u2013March 2019 for subprogram 2. The policy-\nbased loans will be disbursed upon accomplishment of policy triggers. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n28.  The program impact assessment estimates potential net benefits (benefits minus cost) of \nthe program to be about $0.4 billion in present value.22 This gives a benefit\u2013cost ratio of about \n1.4. These direct benefits of about $1.5 billion in present value are due to more youths being \nemployed, and higher earnings of youth in more productive jobs. Costs of about $1.1 billion in \npresent  value  are  expected  be  incurred  from  scaling  up  SPES,  rolling  out  JSP  and \ninstitutionalizing 800 PESOs. The interventions also yield significant distributional benefits, as a \nmajority of beneficiaries are young women and economically disadvantaged youth. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n28.  The  government  has  implemented  major  reforms  to  improve  the  public  financial \nmanagement (PFM) systems.  A proposed Public Financial Accountability Act will help to enforce \naccountability  in  PFM  by  strengthening  Congress\u2019  financial  control  funding,  instituting  an \nintegrated  PFM  system,  and  increasing  budget  transparency  and  participation.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment and the DOF. The government is implementing a comprehensive and results-based \nanticorruption action plan, drawing on a review of the National Anti-Corruption Plan of Action. \nVarious initiatives by development partners to strengthen the capacity of the Office of the \nOmbudsman and the justice sector have achieved positive results.  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n29.  Subprogram 1 is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. NEET rates are higher \namong young women than young men. The program aims to address this gender employment \ngap through policy measures and interventions, including setting quotas for young women \nparticipating in SPES and skills training programs, and a target of 55% for young women \naccessing services under JSP. Further development of a life skills training health module will \ninclude issues specific to women\u2019s health and reproductive health. Overall, it is estimated that \nwomen may account for 80% of the benefits arising from the program (footnote 22). While \ninterventions through the program will benefit a wide range of youth, they may also contribute \ndirectly and/or indirectly to a reduction in income inequality through program targeting of youth \nfrom low-income households and higher youth employment rates. \n \n \n                                                \n22 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nD.  Safeguards \n \n30.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified \ncategory  C  for  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  The \nassessment of policy actions concludes that no safeguard policies are triggered.  Based on an \nassessment of the policy actions, the policy-based loan component will not have any potential \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  issues  and  will  not  have  any  potential \nenvironmental impacts.   \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n31.  Public financial management and corruption are assessed as substantial risks. These \nnational-level  risks  are  being  mitigated  through  strengthening  the  budget  review  process, \ninstitutionalized  transparency,  and  additional  measures  supported  by  ADB  including  the \nenhancement of legislative oversight over anticorruption bodies. Contextual risks include the \npossibility that the government may not secure sufficient national budgetary funding for youth \nemployment and skills training. The JSP Act institutionalizing JSP and amendments to the PESO \nAct and the SPES Act will help ensure the programs continue to support youth employment and \nskills development in the future. Other contextual risks that local governments\u2019 may lack capacity \nand resources at the LGU level to implement these programs are mitigated through recent \nlegislation securing budgetary funding for programs and continuity in TA by ADB to national and \nlocal  government  staff  implementing  the  programs.  All  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are \ndescribed in the risk assessment and risk management plan.23 \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n32.  The government and the DOF have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan agreement.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n33.  I am satisfied that the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based loan would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the \nabsence of the President, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, \nI recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the programmatic approach for the Facilitating Youth School-to-Work Transition \nProgram, and \n(ii)  the loan of $300,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 1 of the \nFacilitating Youth School-to-Work Transition Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of \n15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \nStephen Groff \nVice-President \n21 April 2017 \n                                                \n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Program is Aligned With \nWage employment rate for the country\u2019s youth increased (Philippine Development Plan, 2017\u20132022)a \n \nData Sources \nResults  Performance Indicators with Targets and  and Reporting \nChain  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2022:    The government \nSchool-to-     may not secure \nwork transition  For young women:    sufficient national \nperiod for  a.
