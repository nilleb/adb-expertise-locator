INTRODUCTION \n1.  The government of Papua New Guinea (PNG) has requested technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to address macroeconomic challenges and the urgent \nneed to strengthen government capacity for policy development and execution.1 The TA project \nis aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy and country operations business plan, 2017\u2013\n2019 for the PNG, which in turn align with the Papua New Guinea Development Strategic Plan, \n2010\u20132030.2 The TA will support strategic budgeting within a sustainable medium-term fiscal \nframework, and the efficient and effective management of public funds in light of highly volatile \nrevenues from natural resources. \n \n2.  The  government  has  been  closely  involved  in  defining  the  TA\u2019s  scope,  focus,  and \napproach to ensure that critical problems are addressed. Development partners\u2014including the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  the  World  Bank,  the  Australian  government,  and  the \nEuropean Union\u2014have been consulted on the TA design to ensure that it complements other \npartners\u2019  assistance.  A  policy-based  loan may  be  added  in  2017  to address  development \nfinancing needs and incentivize reform implementation and compliance. \n \n3.  The TA builds upon and advances achievements of two previous TA phases.3 The first \nphase  strengthened  the  oversight  of  statutory  authorities,  improved  project  evaluation  and \nprioritization,  supported  procurement  reform  efforts,  enhanced  subnational  service  delivery \nmonitoring, and began development of the domestic debt market. The TA was rated successful: \ngovernment institutions used policy advice and materials it produced, and development partners \ncarried forward TA outputs in procurement and debt market development. The second phase \nsupported financing arrangements for building and maintaining infrastructure and strengthened \nthe accountability of statutory authorities.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  After a period of fiscal consolidation and public debt reduction from 2008 to 2012, the \ngovernment expanded its fiscal policy stance in 2012, expecting windfall revenue from exporting \nliquefied natural gas. While annual real gross domestic product (GDP) growth increased from an \naverage of 7.8% over 2008\u20132012 to 9.4% over 2013\u20132015, domestic resource mobilization did \nnot keep pace. The domestic-revenue-to-GDP ratio fell from 30.4% of GDP in 2011 to 23.1% in \n2015 as resource revenue dropped from 7.4% of GDP to 1.4% over the same period because of \nweaker global commodity prices. These factors, combined with increased spending, led to a \nfiscal deficit that rose from 0.2% of GDP in 2011 to an unsustainable 9.6% of GDP in 2013. \n \n5.  Government efforts to reverse this trend have had some success: the fiscal deficit fell to \n8.3% of GDP in 2014 and 5.3% of GDP in 2015. However, the protracted downturn in global \n                                                \n1  The TA project first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 July 2016. \n2  ADB.  2015.

Subsequently, the TA completion report will be prepared and published based on \na  thorough  implementation  review.  The  TA  supported  public  finance  management  (PFM)  reform,  including \nmonitoring of statutory authorities. The outputs of the TA were incorporated in the recently revised PFM Act \napproved by the Parliament.  \n ", "2   \ncommodity prices poses risks to the country\u2019s fiscal position. The current Medium-Term Fiscal \nStrategy, 2013\u20132017 has less fiscal anchors than the previous one. Deficits have been largely \nfinanced through domestic borrowing, but market appetite for new government securities is \nlimited and the maturity profile is changing to shorter tenor, raising interest and rollover risks. \nMarket  changes  in  debt  and  commodities  prices  contributed  to  Moody's  Investors  Service \ndowngrading PNG\u2019s rating from B1 to B2 in April 2016. The latest debt sustainability analysis\u2014\nprepared as part of the 2015 Article IV consultation by the IMF and World Bank\u2014indicates that \nPNG\u2019s  risk  of  debt  distress  remains  low  based  on  an  assessment  of  public  and  publicly \nguaranteed external debt. However, the overall risk of debt distress increases when factoring in \npublic domestic and private external debt and contingent liabilities. Weak capacity means the \nTreasury  is  unable  to  effectively  publicly  communicate  its  fiscal  intent,  nor  engage  with \nstakeholders in policy development.  \n \n6.  PNG needs to further cut spending in the short term and introduce new revenue and \nfinancing measures to make its fiscal position more sustainable: public debt has risen from    \n26.7% of GDP in 2012 to 39.5% of GDP in 2015. Budget cuts must be carefully targeted and \npublic spending on development priorities such as health and education safeguarded so that \ngrowth,  basic  service  delivery,  and  progress  toward  development  outcomes  may  continue. \nPublic finance management will need to be strengthened to effectively and efficiently manage \nlimited resources, and internal controls need to be strengthened to ensure public spending \naligns with reduced and prioritized allocations.5 These measures need to be applied equally to \nstatutory authorities and subnational governments that absorb substantial shares of national \nrevenue6 and pose significant fiscal risks.  \n \n7.  New revenue measures, introduced with support from TA from Australia, are expected to \nprovide  some  relief  through  improved  compliance  and  risk  management,  reviewing  of  tax \nexemptions, better management of tax arrears, and taxpayer education. However, most of the \npopulation works in the informal sector, so the potential to raise revenue through taxes is limited. \nLastly, new borrowing needs to be prudent and debt management strengthened to prevent \ninterest payments from rising rapidly. The IMF and the World Bank advise the government on \ndebt management, which needs to be complemented by macroeconomic (including monetary \nand  structural)  policy  reforms.  The  IMF  leads  development  partner  advice  in  this  area.  If \nconcerted  reform  efforts  are  implemented  successfully,  and  with  some  easing  of  global \ncommodity price pressures, the fiscal deficit is projected to narrow to 3.8% of GDP in 2016 and \n2.2% in 2017. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n8.  The TA impacts will be (i) prudent management of PNG\u2019s fiscal policy and budget, and \n(ii) the attainment of high standards of public sector management in all levels and institutions of \n                                                \n5  Many of the immediately necessary reforms aiming at more effective and efficient spending\u2014including stronger \ninternal controls for accountable and transparent budget execution\u2014will stretch into the medium term. These \ninclude ongoing reforms to the integrated financial management information system, public procurement, debt \nmanagement, payroll management, oversight and management of statutory authorities, and the intergovernmental \nfiscal transfer system. Building up a sovereign wealth fund is a medium- to long-term avenue for building fiscal \nbuffers against future commodity price shocks. These reforms are supported by all major development partners, \nincluding ADB. While much of the reforms stretch beyond this TA project\u2019s focus, gaps in assistance that are \nidentified as priorities may potentially be filled by the flexible support available under this TA. \n6  Provinces receive about one-third of the resources from the national budget. \n ", "  3 \ngovernment.7The  outcome  will  be  strengthened  government  capacity  for  prudent  fiscal \nmanagement. The TA will equip the government to take prudent decisions in a strained fiscal \nenvironment that requires gradual adjustments. This will allow the government to reduce the \nfiscal deficit and stabilize debt levels while safeguarding social spending for basic services, \nespecially to poor and vulnerable groups. \n \n9.  The  TA  outcome  will  be  measured  through  (i)  ADB\u2019s  annual  country  performance \nassessment, which reviews institutional performance across a range of  relevant indicators, \nincluding  fiscal  policy  and  quality  of  budgetary  and  financial  management;  and  (ii)  public \nexpenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) assessments, or equivalent reviews in between \nPEFA assessments. The PEFA performance indicators that are most relevant to this TA project \ncover public access to key fiscal information and fiscal risk management. Improvements in \ncapacity are expected to gradually lift PNG\u2019s PEFA performance scores. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA has two outputs:  \n \n(i)  Prioritized spending within a sustainable fiscal envelope supported. The \nmain focus of this output is policy advice on and technical support for economic \nand fiscal analysis and upstream public financial management (PFM). Activities \nwould  include  developing  a  credible,  regularly  updated  medium-term  fiscal \nstrategy; annual budgets; and in-year budget reporting. The output also aims to \nstrengthen budget processes and formats to increase the sustainability of ADB\u2019s \nsupport. The output will explore the possibility of increasing public engagement in \nthe budget process, in coordination with the communication activities in output 2. \nThe output also provides flexible support for reforms in economic management, \nupstream PFM, and downstream PFM to respond to evolving reform needs and \npolitical  windows of opportunity. Potential reform areas in downstream PFM, \nwhich aim to improve spending in line with a credible budget, include support for \ninternal controls, compliance with budget execution rules and procedures, and \nmanagement of government trust accounts. Flexible support under this output \nwill  be  prioritized  in  close  consultation  with  government  stakeholders  and \ndevelopment partners. \n \n(ii)  Fiscal  and  public  financial  management  reform  program  communicated \neffectively  to  all  stakeholders.  This  output  aims  to  support  output  1  by \nfacilitating a constructive reform dialogue among key stakeholders (national and \nsubnational public sector, the private sector, and the general public), and by \nsupporting coordination, cooperation, and buy-in among all affected groups. This \nalso  aims  to  help  the  government  signal  commitment  to  prudent  fiscal \nmanagement and support for the private sector. A brief, focused communication \nstrategy will assess  existing limitations  in government communication,  define \nreform priorities, and identify effective and efficient communication channels for \ntargeted audiences. It will then focus on facilitating better internal and external \ncommunication, including informal coordination forums, regular press briefings, \npolicy  briefs,  and  economic  updates.  The  TA  will  build  the  government\u2019s \ncommunication capacity through training and mentoring. \n                                                \n7  Government of PNG, Department of National Planning and Monitoring. 2010. Papua New Guinea Development \nStrategic Plan, 2010-2030. Port Moresby. \n ", "4   \n11.  The Department of Treasury (DOT) said during discussions on the TA design that it \npreferred to work directly with ADB. Deepening the trusted relationship, maintaining continuous \ndialogue on fiscal management, and providing access to high-quality knowledge solutions are \ncritical to develop joint solutions to the country\u2019s pressing fiscal issues. For this, ADB\u2019s PNG \nresident mission requires expertise and resources to engage meaningfully and regularly with the \nauthorities, as well as to coordinate with development partners.  \n  \n12.  The PNG Resident Mission\u2019s country director and country economist will continue to \nlead dialogue with the DOT and other relevant departments on fiscal policy. The TA will provide \nthe resident mission with high-quality expertise and support to develop and implement specific \nmeasures in a flexible and responsive manner. This approach is consistent with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy, fosters space for a joint reform agenda to emerge, and provides flexibility \nto support reforms that the government prioritizes. The TA aims to strengthen government \ncapacity through day-to-day staff mentoring rather than to replace it with external advisors. \n \n13.  The TA will closely coordinate with other partners to save resources. In addition to \nsupport from ADB, PNG receives PFM support from Australia, the European Union, the IMF, the \nPacific  Financial  Technical  Assistance  Centre,  and  the  World  Bank.  The  Public  Finance \nWorking  Group  consisting  of  partners  and  the  government  will  be  the  main  forum  for \ncoordinating TA activities. Short-term consultancy inputs from ADB will seek to align with and \nrespond to the recommendations of the PEFA assessment and IMF Article IV staff reports.    \n \n14.  Risks\u2014such  as  waning  government  commitment  to  macroeconomic  and  fiscal \nmanagement  and  insufficient  policy  coordination  among  key  government  agencies\u2014are \nmitigated or minimized through the TA design. Ongoing oversight from ADB\u2019s resident mission \nwill further allow appropriate responses to evolving risks. Oversight from ADB\u2019s resident mission \nwill include the regular assessment of progress toward the (i) adoption of a credible medium-\nterm fiscal strategy; (ii) safeguarding of allocation toward medium-term national development \npriorities; (iii) fiscal consolidation through cuts to nonproductive and wasteful expenditure; and \n(iv)  frequent  public  government  communication  on  the  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  position. \nRegular macroeconomic and PFM reviews, such as IMF Article IV staff reports, will serve as \nindependent sources to verify progress against these milestones. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,150,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support,  including  staff  time,  office  space,  office  supplies,  secretarial \nassistance, and domestic transportation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months from November 2016 to October 2019. The \ninitial  funding  will  be  $1,000,000,  despite  likely  larger  financing  needs,  to  (i)  gauge  the \ngovernment\u2019s willingness to take on TA recommendations, (ii) avoid ring-fencing of scarce \ndepartmental TA resources until needed, and (iii) provide an opportunity to pursue cofinancing. \nIf additional financing or cofinancing is needed and can be secured, the design and monitoring \nframework will be expanded to reflect any additional contributions to TA outcome, outputs, and \nactivities.  \n \n ", "  5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the executing and implementing agency. ADB will administer the TA in close \ncollaboration  with  the DOT. The  Department of  National  Planning  and  Monitoring  and the \nDepartment  of  Finance  will  also  be  key  counterparts  given  their  critical  roles  in  planning, \npreparing, and executing the budget. The DOT has asked ADB to help set up a macroeconomic \npolicy analysis committee, chaired by the Treasury Secretary and with representatives from the \nTreasury  Fiscal  Policy  and  Budget  Division,  the  Bank  of  Papua  New  Guinea,  country \neconomists from ADB and the World Bank, and a representative from the National Research \nInstitute.8 The macroeconomic policy analysis committee will provide strategic guidance on the \nfiscal consolidation process and act as the TA\u2019s steering committee. The TA will also closely \ncoordinate with the Public Finance Working Group. \n \n18.  The TA is expected to mobilize 27 person-months of individual consultants from the \ninitial grant of $1,000,000. An international public finance economist will work on both outputs. \nThe country economist will supervise the consultant, who will be based at the resident mission. \nShe or he will be responsible for providing DOT and other relevant departments with technical \nsupport on budget operations, for building capacity, and for providing advice on fiscal policy \ncommunication. A pool of short-term public finance specialists will also be recruited to provide \nflexible, highly specialized expertise as required. All experts will be recruited following ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline terms \nof  reference  is  in  Appendix  3.  TA  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n19.  Resident mission staff and technical and administrative support from the sector division \nwill  be  allocated to  support TA management  and  administration,  and  to  oversee  technical \noutputs. ADB will determine whether the resident mission country economist needs support to \nmanage the TA and its technical outputs, and explore avenues for funding such support.  \n \n20.  The resident mission country economist (also acting as the TA team leader) will monitor \nthe TA on an ongoing basis during implementation. Consultants will be required to submit \nregular progress and final reports. Specific technical outputs such as reports or policy briefs will \nbe specified in the consultants\u2019 terms of reference. Evaluation of the TA will draw on (i) these \ntechnical TA outputs; (ii) TA performance against output and outcome indicators in the design \nand monitoring framework; and (iii) the findings of assessments by ADB and development \npartners,  including  ADB\u2019s  country  performance  assessment  for  PNG  and  the  next  PEFA \nassessment. The consultants and the ADB TA team leader will identify good practices and \nlessons and outline these in TA outputs. Practices and lessons applicable to other countries will \nbe  shared,  with  support  from  ADB\u2019s  responsible  sector  division,  through  policy  briefs  and \npresentations at regional conferences, such as the annual Pacific Update conference. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nPapua New Guinea for Supporting Public Financial Management (Phase 3), and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n                                                \n8  Either the Department of National Planning and Monitoring and the Department of Finance will be part of the \nmacroeconomic  policy  analysis  committee  or  another  coordination  mechanism  will  be  used  to  strengthen \ninterdepartmental communication, coordination, and collaboration in planning and budget formulation.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the TA is Aligned with \nFiscal policy and budget prudently managed; and high standards of public sector management in all \nlevels and institutions of government attained (Papua New Guinea Development Strategic Plan, 2010\u2013\n2030)a \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  and Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By the end of 2019:     \nGovernment  a.
