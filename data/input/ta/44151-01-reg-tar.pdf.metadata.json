INTRODUCTION \n1.  Community-driven development (CDD) approaches have been supported as tools for \naddressing poverty, improving governance, and promoting inclusion. Introduced in the mid-\n1990s, CDD projects have been implemented in more than 100 countries, including 25 in Asia \nand the Pacific. The World Bank\u2019s 2003 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper Sourcebook1 defines \nCDD as an approach that gives control over planning decisions and investment resources for \nlocal development projects to community groups. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) adopts \nfive  elements  in  defining  CDD:  a  community  focus,  participatory  planning  and  design, \ncommunity  control  of  resources,  community  involvement  in  implementation,  and  use  of \ncommunity-based participatory monitoring and evaluation to ensure downward accountability to \nthe community. \n \n2.  Since 2001, ADB has financed 80 projects with CDD characteristics throughout Asia and \nthe Pacific. Through case studies and exchanges among policy makers, members of academia, \ncivil  society  organizations,  and  developing  member  country  (DMC)  representatives,  the \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  Supporting  Community-Driven  Development  in  Developing \nMember Countries2 confirmed the following benefits of the approach: (i) infrastructure projects of \nequal or better quality are delivered at less cost than other government projects; (ii) there is high \nparticipation of women and the poor; (iii) there is lower corruption; and (iii) there is high potential \nfor generating employment, especially during economic downturns. Recent forums sponsored \nby  the  TA  confirm  such  benefits.3 The  same  forums,  however,  emphasize  the  need  for \nadditional  support  and  the  establishment  of  a  network  of  practitioners  for  knowledge \nmanagement and shared learning, especially in new and upcoming frontiers of environmental \nprotection,  achievement  of  Millennium  Development  Goals,  and  local  governance,  and  in \nscaling up the approach.   \n \n3.  A study by ADB in 2006 cited the high potential of CDD approaches for scaling up, but \ncautioned against universal approaches and emphasized the need to pay attention to contexts \nand appropriate designs.4 The study, citing various evaluations of ADB and partners, also \nemphasized the need for partnerships with practitioners and institutions\u2014such as the World \nBank and other institutions\u2014on CDD design and implementation, which could take the form of \nnetworks, joint learning events, staff exchange programs and joint missions, and joint research. \nIn response, this TA project has been designed to build the capacity of DMCs to introduce or \nscale  up  community  development  operations  through  (i)  research  and  documentation,  (ii) \nestablishing a knowledge hub for CDD, and (iii) supporting a CDD network of practitioners. This \nTA paper defines the output, methodology, and key activities of the project. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \n \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2003. The World Bank PRSP Sourcebook.

ISSUES \n4.  Lessons  drawn  from  the  TA  for  Supporting  Community-Driven  Development  in \nDeveloping Member Countries emphasize the need for supporting knowledge sharing among a \nnetwork of practitioners on community development approaches so as to improve the capacity \nof DMCs for scaling up. While much has been done to document learning from different models, \nmuch more can be gained through formal cooperation and networking among practitioners to \nshare experiences and innovations. In addition, what may have worked in one setting may not \nbe applicable to another. This was emphasized at the International Conference on Community-\nDriven Development and Rural Poverty Alleviation, held on 18\u201319 October 2009 in Beijing, \nwhere participants raised the value of networking and cooperation, especially in knowledge and \nexperience sharing. CDD projects in Asia and the Pacific have benefitted from exchanges and \nnetworking.6 Designs of these projects are context-specific, with regard having been given to \nwhat  worked  and  did  not  work  in  other  countries.  There  is  thus  high  value  in  supporting \ncontinuing exchanges on the approach. There is a large amount of information from (i) research \nand lessons gained from experience in CDD,7 (ii) information on what worked and what did not; \nand  (iii)  responses  to  the  common  challenges  of  elite  capture,  anticorruption,  adaptive \nmanagement schemes, and governance issues. This body of knowledge constitutes a wealth of \ninformation  that  can  create  greater  impact  if  organized  and  made  accessible  to  various \nstakeholders. This effort can also facilitate cross-fertilization of initiatives and inform policy \ndecisions, programming, and project design.   \n \n5.  There is also a need to support local development platforms that can serve multiple \nobjectives. Experience has shown that, once a CDD platform exists, it can be used for multiple \ndevelopment objectives, including (i) improved infrastructure and service delivery, (ii) improved \nlivelihood opportunities, (iii) better climate adaptation and natural resource management, and (iv) \nmore recently, as a safety net and social service delivery mechanism. CDD has contributed to \nthe development of local platforms linked to decentralization efforts and reconstruction and post-\nconflict interventions. While most elements of the approach are the same, their application in \nspecific situations and countries will vary. Capturing experience and practice, through more \nresearch  and  documentation,  to  produce  and  organize  community  development  tools  and \nlearning materials will contribute to the introduction of appropriate models or the scaling up of \nexisting models throughout Asia and the Pacific. Areas of special interest for focused studies \ninclude integrating with decentralization initiatives, institutionalizing fiscal transfer arrangements \nand accountability frameworks, and improving gender outcomes.  \n \n6.  However, CDD approaches have had mixed results and CDD does not apply in all \nsettings.  The  use  of  CDD  approaches  for  microfinance,  for  example,  was  generally \nunsuccessful in the first round in Indonesia. The same approaches in the Philippines, however, \nhave met with more success. Some national (and international) development priorities\u2014such as \nHIV/AIDS, climate change adaptation, conflict prevention, and large-scale infrastructure\u2014do not \nalways coincide with community priorities, making it difficult to address them through community \napproaches.  Urban  development  and  slum  upgrading,  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise \ndevelopment, microfinance, and onlending projects are areas where community development \napproaches have had mixed results. Fiduciary aspects of CDD were raised as critical issues, for \nexample, in urban projects in Indonesia. Documentation of past and current initiatives can \n                                                 \n6  Philippines' Kapitbisig Laban sa Kahirapan (Linking Arms Againt Poverty) \u2013 Comprehensive and IntegratedDelivery \nof Social Services (KALAHI-CIDSS) projects and the People's Republic of China's (PRC) CDD pilots. \n7  Including  World  Bank\u2013Operations  Evaluation  Department.  2005.

Among the models that the TA will review are the Korean Saemul Undung experience, \nIndonesia's Kecamatan Development Program, the Philippines' Kapitbisig Laban sa Kahirapan \n\u2013 Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social Services (KALAHI-CIDSS), and the CDD \npilots in the People's Republic of China (PRC).   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n8.  This TA will build the capacity of DMCs to scale up community development operations \nthrough (i) research and documentation of lessons learned, on selected themes;8 (ii) setting up \na knowledge and learning hub and an e-library of resources on community development to \nshare and disseminate information among practitioners, DMCs, and development partners; and \n(iii) support for a network of practitioners9 by helping to establish and strengthen informal and \nformal community development networks within ADB and between ADB and external agencies.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA will contribute to more inclusive economic growth in DMCs stemming from \nincreased demand for and application of community development approaches. The TA will \nstrengthen  the  capacity  of  DMCs  to  apply  community  development  approaches  through \nknowledge sharing and cooperation among participating countries and institutions. This effort is \nexpected to result in greater demand for such interventions. The outcome will be increased \nawareness and improved readiness of DMCs to design and implement community development \nprojects. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will support research in selected areas of community development. From the \nresearch, operational approaches to situations of fragility, weak governance, exclusion, or post-\nconflict will be developed and, to the extent applicable, integrated into various initiatives for \nmainstreaming  community  development  in  DMC  operations.  Thematic  areas  of  gender, \ninclusion, monitoring and evaluation, and measuring results and impact, among others, will also \nbe studied. Country-specific or regional approaches in community development in new areas, \nsuch as urban development, climate change adaptation, HIV/AIDS, and such areas as may be \nidentified by the network, will be explored and/or supported through studies and technical inputs. \nThe TA, in coordination with regional operations departments and network participants, will \nidentify priority areas for further study during implementation and facilitate coordination among \ndevelopment partners in the region. \n \n11.  The experience of at least four countries (the PRC, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, and \nthe Philippines) in community development will be documented, and tools will be compiled for \ndissemination  to  DMCs  and  development  partners.  These  country  experience  include  the \nSaemul Undung movement of the Republic of Korea, the Kecamatan Development Project in \nIndonesia, the KALAHI-CIDSS CDD project in the Philippines, and the CDD experience in the \n                                                 \n8  The indicative list of areas for study include the Saemul Undung experience, CDD in urban settings, CDD and \nclimate adaptation, gender, and local governance. \n9  An informal network of CDD of practitioners exists in ADB. The TA intends to work with external practitioners, \nincluding civil society organizations, DMCs, project managers of ongoing CDD projects, practitioners in other \ndevelopment organizations, academia, and local governments. \n ", "4  \nPRC. Experience in the Pacific will also be included upon expression of interest by countries in \nthat  region.  The  countries  were  chosen  based  on  their previous  experience in  community \ndevelopment, their participation in a previous TA project on CDD, and their willingness to \nparticipate in this new initiative. \n \n12.  The  TA  will  foster  knowledge  in  community  development  and  provide  learning \nopportunities on priority development topics. Information and tools gathered and knowledge \nproducts developed will be disseminated through a learning hub managed by the network of \npractitioners and ADB. These include practical and cost-effective tools for measuring results, \nreal-time data gathering, and similar tools to ensure effectiveness of the approach. The hub will \nsponsor and coordinate learning and knowledge events, workshops and seminars, and online \nexchanges to address the needs for information and learning of the network. The hub will also \nserve as a regional resource center of information on lessons learned, tool kits in use, expertise, \nand other similar resources. To support the hub, a community development portal will be \ndeveloped and maintained. At the end of the TA, it is envisioned that the hub will be jointly \nmanaged by network members supported under the next activity. The hub will be open for use \nby members of the network, DMC officials and practitioners, ADB staff, and civil society groups. \n \n13.  The TA will also strengthen or formalize existing networks in community development \nand facilitate interaction among representatives from academia, policy makers, researchers, \nand development practitioners, and among ADB operational departments. The network will \nsupport DMCs in the development of their country-specific community development models and \nenhance ADB\u2019s ability to respond to their needs more effectively. Joint activities in project \ndevelopment and knowledge and resource sharing will be identified and pursued. Among the \nnetworks to be supported are the participants and resource speakers at the recent Beijing \nInternational  Community  Driven  Development  (CDD)  Conference,  the  internal  ADB  CDD \nnetwork, and CDD practitioners in DMCs.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  to  be \nadministered by ADB. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA project, which will be managed by ADB\u2019s \nPoverty Reduction, Gender, and Social Development Division of the Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment Department. A team of Poverty Reduction, Gender, and Social Development \nDivision  staff,  including  two  professional  members  of  staff,  one  national  officer,  and  two \noperations assistants, will coordinate and manage the consultants\u2019 activities and consolidate \ntheir outputs. The project will be carried out over 16 months, from April 2010 to August 2011.  \n \n16.  The  TA  will  require  a  total  of  20  person-months  of  consulting  services.  Three \ninternational consultants (total of 12 person-months) and two national consultants (total of 8 \nperson-months)  based  in  Manila  will  form  the  core  TA  consulting  team.  The  international \nconsultants will have expertise in community-driven development, knowledge management, and \nsocial development. The national consultants will have expertise in information technology and \nconference management. Country-based national consultants will be engaged to undertake \ncountry-level studies for 10 months. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance \nwith  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \n ", "  5\nDisbursements  will  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (May \n2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  in \nAppendix 3. \n \n17.  The TA will disseminate learning and good practices through a website and several \nworkshops and learning events, bringing together participating countries, development partners, \nand civil society organizations.  \n \nIV.
