The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will provide Pacific developing \nmember countries (DMCs) with technical support and policy advice in urban development, \ncapacity building, and project preparation for a series of ensuing projects, comprising: the Koror-\nAirai Sanitation Project Phase 2 (Palau), Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Development Sector \nProject  (Solomon  Islands),  Port  Vila  Urban  Development  Project  Phase  2  (Vanuatu),  and \nLuganville Urban Development Project (Vanuatu).  \n \n2.  The proposed TA will support the Pacific Approach 2016-2020 strategic priority of enabling \nvalue creation by promoting livable and economically vibrant urban areas, supporting projects \nthat will help governments with long-term urban planning to ensure that services can be sustained, \nand encourage private sector and civil society organization involvement in the provision of urban \ninfrastructure and services.1 The proposed TA facility will also support the Pacific Approach to \nprovide (i) stronger, better, faster project delivery through expanded use of regional approaches \nand faster delivery mechanisms, and (ii) improved generation and sharing of knowledge. \n \n3.  The Pacific region is rapidly urbanizing as a result of internal migration and natural \npopulation increase, with 44% of the Pacific\u2019s population, excluding Papua New Guinea, now \nliving in urban areas. In the region\u2019s smallest countries, such as the Cook Islands, at least three \nout of every four residents are already urban dwellers. Larger DMCs that are still predominantly \nrural, such as Solomon Islands, have the highest urbanization growth rates, driving the growing \ninterest to invest in urban infrastructure.  \n \n4.  Urban growth in Pacific DMCs has been largely unplanned, resulting in inadequate basic \nurban  infrastructure  services  such  as  water  supply,  sanitation,  flood  control,  solid  waste \nmanagement and urban transport; and a shortage of affordable serviced land and housing2. \nSquatter  settlements  are  proliferating,  natural  resources  are  becoming  overexploited,  and \nincreasing numbers of citizens are vulnerable to flooding and natural disasters. Reversing the \ndeterioration in living conditions in the Pacific region\u2019s growing towns and cities is essential if they \nare to become livable and economically vibrant environments. \n \n5.  In the most rapidly urbanizing Pacific DMCs, the bulk of urban growth is taking place in \nunserviced informal settlements, particularly in peri-urban areas, often located on customary land, \noutside  of  town  boundaries.  In  tourism-dependent  economies,  such  as  Palau,  the  lack  of \nadequate urban environmental infrastructure to manage growing volumes of solid and liquid \nwastes is contributing to the degradation of the surrounding natural environment, which has the \npotential to undermine tourism growth. In small, low-lying atoll countries, such as the Marshall \nIslands, urbanization is increasing the exposure of people and critical urban assets to climate \nchange risks. \n \n6.  The  limited  capacity  to  plan,  prepare,  manage,  and  coordinate  urban  investments; \ninadequate revenue streams to finance and maintain such investments; and poor accountability \nfor the quality  of  urban  service  delivery  all  contribute to  the  challenge  of promoting more \nsustainable urban development in Pacific DMCs. Many Pacific DMCs lack the strategies needed \nto sustainably plan and manage urban development in their cities and towns. Where strategies \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach 2016 \u2013 2020. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2016.The Emergence of Pacific Urban Villages. Urbanizations Trends in the Pacific islands. Manila. \n ", "2 \nand plans for the urban sector do exist, preparation and implementation is often constrained by \nthe lack of capacity and resources to undertake thorough investment preparatory work. \n \n7.  For example, lessons learned from previous urban projects in the Pacific pointed at the \nneed to increase the capacity of institutions and staff as a necessary condition for sustainable \nwater supply and sanitation operations. Low capacity exists within institutions and among decision \nmakers where a basic understanding of water supply and sanitation operations is often lacking. \nAlso,  politicians  and  the  public  often  hold  common  misconceptions.  However,  to  assure \nsustainable projects, experience has shown that capacity building must accompany physical \ninvestments.3 \n \n8.  Recent Asian Development Bank (ADB) urban-related TAs in the Pacific helped prepare \nsector analysis, reviewed urban policy and conducted project preparatory related assessments.4 \nThe demand-driven approach and close consultations with host governments led to successful \ndelivery of these output, however the largely single country focus did not encourage cross country \nlearning and slowed ADB\u2019s response time to new requests. ADB continues to receive requests \nfrom Pacific DMCs to assist in in project preparatory work addressing urban challenges, provide \nimplementation  support,  technical  advice,  capacity  development,  and  assist  in  knowledge \nproduction. The proposed Facility is designed to respond to these requests efficiently while \nleveraging a stronger knowledge outcome. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n9.  Output 1: Urban sector project feasibility and preparation assistance. Technical \nexpertise will be provided to Pacific DMCs to prioritize, plan, and prepare investments projects for \npotential ADB financing. This will include all kinds of necessary due diligences, assessment of \ntechnical suitability, economic, financial and social viability, capacity and institutional issues, \naddress  environmental and  social safeguards, and  identify measures  to  strengthen  project \nimplementation capacity for urban investment projects. This will enhance the efficiency of project \npreparation,  address  cross-cutting  issues,  and  will  reduce  the  transaction  costs  through \nminimizing  the  need  for  stand-alone  transaction  TAs.  Detailed  activities  will  include,  when \nrequired: (i) feasibility studies required for the ensuing investment; (ii) economic analysis; (iii) \nfinancial  management  assessment,  financial  evaluation  and  financial  analysis;  (iv)  gender \nanalysis,  collection  of  baseline  data  and  gender  action  plans;  (v)  risk  assessment  and \nmanagement plans; (vi) safeguards documents on environment, involuntary resettlement and \nindigenous peoples; and (vii) sector assessment. \n \n10.  Output  2:  Demand-driven  urban  technical  advice,  assessment,  and  capacity \ndevelopment. Technical expertise, assessment, diagnostics, and other analytical work and \ncapacity  building  support  will  be  provided  to  Pacific  DMCs  to  enhance  urban  investments \nsustainability, ad hoc diagnostic analysis, and financial planning (e.g. tariff review etc.). The TA \nfacility  will  support  policy  dialogue  and  informed  decisions  and  negotiations  in  designing \nregulatory frameworks and devising investment options. This will also cover independent peer \nreviews, collection and maintenance of accurate data required for policy formulation, regulation, \nand urban investment planning. These activities will be undertaken with the engagement of \ngovernment staff and national institutions, through on-the-job training as well as participation in \nappropriate training opportunities, to help build country capacity and create a cadre of national \nstaff who are familiar with the critical elements of preparing urban investments. ADB will evaluate \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2015. Sustainability of Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Operations: Findings and Lessons.

Requests should be linked to ongoing or immediately \nensuing urban investments and programs within the core TA priority areas (but not necessarily \nlinked to ADB potential investments) and should be outside the scope of ongoing assistance by \nother development partners. \n \n11.  Based on previous experiences, DMCs demands for urban technical advice have been \nfocusing particularly on peer reviews of core capabilities of urban services operators,  and \nindependent audit of water supply systems, including: (i) technical inspection of infrastructure; \n(ii) review of water reliability; (iii) water quality; (iv) assessment of the knowledge and capability \nof local operators; (v) customer feedback and satisfaction; and (vi) work place health and safety \nstandards in the operation of water systems. \n \n12.  Output 3: Enhance knowledge sharing among Pacific DMCs. The TA facility will \nsupport the organization of trainings, workshops, and conferences at the regional level, enhancing \nknowledge and lesson sharing among Pacific DMCs and regional urban apex bodies. The TA \nfacility will also support, when required, the production of knowledge products, taking stock of \nlessons  learned  from  urban  legislative  and  policy  formulation,  infrastructure  investment \nexperiences, and human resource capacity development in the Pacific. In particular, the TA facility \nwill support the Pacific Water and Wastewater Association in the organization of the annual Pacific \nWater Conference, and will work in close collaboration with ADB\u2019s Urban Sector Group to collect \nand disseminate appropriate lessons learned and knowledge products within ADB and to policy \nmakers, line ministries, and urban planners in Pacific DMCs. Where applicable, the Pacific Water \nand Wastewater Association and the Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility Water and Sanitation \nSector Working Group may be mobilized to assist in this process. This output will help increase \nawareness of other countries\u2019 activities, and increase links and networking for future collaboration. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA facility is estimated to initially cost $1.8 million, which will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-VI). The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 2. The TA scope is expected to be expanded to cover other additional activities, \nconsistent with the TA\u2019s outputs and outcome, and be replenished from time to time as funds are \nrequired and identified.  \n \n14.  Governments will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions. The \ngovernments were informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing \nproject. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA facility activities for preparing an ensuing project will start only after the relevant \nproject concept paper is approved by ADB. Concept papers for ensuing projects listed in Appendix \n2 are expected to be approved during the second half of 2017, starting with the project in Solomon \nIslands, which concept paper approval is expected in August 2017. \n \n16.   ADB  Urban,  Social  Development  and  Public  Management  Division  of  the  Pacific \nDepartment will administer the TA facility. ADB will be the executing agency responsible for \nconsultant recruitment in close consultation with participating governments. Concurrence will be \nsought from participating governments for shortlisting of consultants. ADB\u2019s main government \ncounterpart in each country will assist ADB in identifying the TA facility focal agency based on the \n ", "4 \nscope of the government\u2019s requests. The participating governments will mobilize key government \nstaff and national organizations to participate in undertaking analytical work and other technical \nadvice through on-the-job experience or appropriate training to help build country capacity for \nurban  development.  Close  coordination  will  be  maintained  with  resident  missions,  other \ndevelopment  partners,  and  relevant  regional  organizations  and  bodies  during  TA  facility \nimplementation. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  August 2017\u2013August 2022 \nExecuting agency  ADB \nTo be selected and engaged by ADB, through quality- and cost-based \nConsultants \nselection with a quality cost ratio of 90:10. \nOutput based \n  $1,800,000 \nMinimum 1 package per project \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAsset  turnover  or  disposal  Procurement of goods is not foreseen. \narrangement upon TA completion \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n17.  The use of this TA facility for project feasibility and preparation assistance does not \nexclude the use of Project Design Advance (PDA) for preparation of project bidding documents, \nsurveys, procurement support, preparation of detailed designs as well as project management \nand supervision. \n \n18.  Consulting services. The proposed TA facility will finance international and national \nconsulting services on an output basis. It is expected to recruit consulting firms to deliver project \nfeasibility and preparation assistance (output 1) and individual consultants to deliver demand-\ndriven  technical  advice  and  capacity  developments  (outputs  2  and  3).  Unless  there  is  a \njustification to use indefinite delivery contracts, outputs based contracts in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) will be used. The \nconsultants will consist of urban development specialists as primary experts, including financial, \nbusiness, legal, social, environmental, gender expertise, and other experts as required. The \nexperts will have experience in their respective fields and demonstrate sound technical knowledge \nof urban development issues.5 Disbursements under the TA facility will be made in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nThe TA facility will be implemented over 60 months, commencing in August 2017.  \n \nE.  Governance \n19.  Since ADB is the executing agency, the financial management, procurement and integrity \nrisks during TA implementation are assessed to be low. However, thorough risk assessments for \nfinancial management, procurement, and integrity for ensuing investment projects implemented \nin any of the target countries will be conducted under the TA. \n \n \n                                                \n5  The outline terms of reference for the consultants form a Linked Document (Appendix 3). \n ", "5 \nII.

The TRTA will assist PMDCs to strengthen capacity and policy for urban development, \ncapacity building and support the preparation of urban and water sector projects in PMDCs. The \nTRTA will support Pacific DMCs to objectively analyze the costs and benefits of available urban \ninvestment  options,  to  plan,  design  and  prioritize  investments,  assess  technical  suitability, \neconomic, financial and social viability, capacity and institutional issues, address environmental \nand social safeguards and, identify measures to strengthen project implementation capacity of \nurban investment projects. At the same time, the countries need to develop institutional, policy \nand human resource capacity to effectively plan and manage urban investments, so that social \nand economic benefits are maximized. The proposed TRTA will serve as a facility to support \nPacific DMCs in making informed and strategic decisions on urban investments by supporting \nnecessary  activities  such  as  capacity  development,  training,  knowledge  sharing  and \ndissemination, technical advice, peer reviews etc. \n \n2.  Detailed terms of reference will be formulated for each output category on a case-by-case \nbasis. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will evaluate government requests for assistance \nbased on (i) government commitment to pursue urban development projects; (ii) relevance and \nlinks  to  ongoing  and  forthcoming  urban  investment  and  programs  in  the  country;  (iii) \ncomplementarity with development partners; and (iv) capacity to mobilize the full participation of \ngovernment staff and national organizations from concerned areas who will take part in the TRTA \nactivities  through  on-the-job  and  other  training.  ADB,  through  the  Pacific  Department,  will \ncoordinate  the  overall  TRTA  activities  working  closely  with  resident  missions  and  other \ndevelopment partners. \n \n3.  These terms of reference are output based as opposed to traditional input-based terms of \nreference. The consulting firms are requested to focus on proposing how to produce and deliver \nthe required outputs of high quality rather than on proposing quality inputs for the consulting \nservice. The consulting firms (recruited through quality- and cost-based selection with a quality \ncost  ratio  of  90:10)  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  consultants  may  include  urban \ndevelopment specialists, engineers, financial management specialist, public-private partnership \nspecialists, legal draftspersons, social safeguards specialist, environmental specialists, gender \nspecialist, communications and awareness specialists, hygiene awareness specialists, and other \nexperts as required. The experts will have experience in their respective fields and demonstrate \nsound technical knowledge of urban development issues. Disbursements under the TRTA will be \nmade in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (as amended \nfrom time to time). The TA will be implemented over 60 months, commencing on August 2017 \nand the TA funds may be replenished through additional financing. \n \nB.  MAJOR OUTPUTS  \n \n4.
