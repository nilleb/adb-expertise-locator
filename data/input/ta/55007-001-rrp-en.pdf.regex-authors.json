THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nMongolia for the Support for COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery in Mongolia under the Asia Pacific \nVaccine Access Facility.1 The project will benefit substantively from an abbreviated consideration \nperiod by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board of Directors as it will expedite disbursement \nthrough retroactive financing of Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX)-eligible coronavirus \ndisease  (COVID-19)  vaccines.  The  government  is  negotiating  supply  contracts  with \nmanufacturers of APVAX-eligible vaccines for immediate procurement.  \n \n2.  The project is structured to provide the Government of Mongolia with immediate and \nflexible financing to purchase safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 through APVAX. The \nrapid response component (RRC) will provide financing for direct procurement of APVAX-eligible \nvaccines  from  manufacturers  as  well  as  international  logistics  to  Mongolia.  The  Asian \nInfrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) will provide joint cofinancing to support the procurement of \nAPVAX-eligible COVID-19 vaccines, in full alignment with the project outcome and ADB\u2019s policies \nand procedures. \n \n3.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  operational  priorities  of  Strategy  2030:  \n(i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, (ii) accelerating progress in gender \nequality, (iii) strengthening governance and institutional capacity, and (iv) fostering regional \ncooperation and integration.2 The project is consistent with the ADB country partnership strategy \nfor Mongolia, 2017\u201320203 as well as the upcoming country partnership strategy for Mongolia, \n2021\u20132024 which aims to help the country recover from COVID-19 and lay resilient foundations \nfor inclusive and sustainable growth.  \n \n4.  Mongolia  has  met  the  criteria  required  for  accessing  APVAX  as  detailed  in  \nTable 1. The government has (i) demonstrated an adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,  \n(ii) completed a needs assessment and a National Deployment and Vaccination Plan (NDVP),  \n(iii) prepared an incremental medical waste management plan, (iv) organized direct contracting \nprocurement  arrangements  in  line  with  ADB  guidelines,  (v) submitted  the  governor\u2019s  letter \nconfirming the government\u2019s commitment to ensure compliance with the APVAX vaccine eligibility \ncriteria, and (vi) established an effective development partner coordination mechanism. \n \nTable 1: Compliance with Criteria of Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility \nAccess Criteria  ADB Assessment \n1.  Demonstrated adverse  COVID-19 is forecasted to significantly increase the poverty rate from its level of \nimpact of the COVID-19  28.4% in 2018. Job losses increased to 133,000 in Q1 2021 which is an 11.2% \npandemic  reduction in total jobs compared to Q4 2019. Based on historical experience \nMongolia is vulnerable to economic shocks with the pre-COVID-19 poverty level \nat 28.4% with a further 27.3% living just above the poverty line. A high proportion \nof people live in ger (Mongolian traditional dwelling) areas with poor access to \nwater, sanitation, and social services, which increases their vulnerability. The \npandemic disproportionately affects women, who comprise 82.0% of frontline \nhealth workers.  \n \n1  The proposed project was prepared under the One ADB approach following streamlined business processes outlined \nin the APVAX policy paper [R195-20], including an abbreviated Board circulation period.

WHO has endorsed the \nNDVP, which provides guidelines for the allocation of vaccines according to \ninternational best practice. The plan also outlines timelines, population targets, \nprioritization of key populations, financing needs, monitoring and evaluation \nprocedures, and other measures. It builds on Mongolia\u2019s successful childhood \nimmunization program, which reached 99.4% of the population in 2019. The ADB \nHealth Sector Group has confirmed the status of the NDVP as endorsed by WHO \nand acceptable to ADB. \n  Incremental medical  Medical  waste  management  is  carried  out  following  standard  procedures \nwaste management plan  approved by the joint order of the ministers of health and environment.a ADB has \nsupported medical waste management systems in Mongolia that can support \nmedical waste management for COVID-19 vaccines. The NDVP addresses \nmedical waste arrangements based on national law and WHO guidelines. Due \ndiligence  on  medical  waste  systems  conducted  by  ADB  has  determined \nadherence to safeguard standards. \n  Governor's letter  On 26 March 2021, ADB received a governor\u2019s letter confirming the government\u2019s \ncommitment to implement its COVID-19 NDVP and its intent to comply with the \nvaccine eligibility criteria for APVAX. \n3.

THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n5.  Mongolia\u2019s COVID-19 situation. COVID-19 was first detected in the People\u2019s Republic \nof China in December 2019, prompting the Government of Mongolia to respond immediately to \navoid rapid spread of the disease. The State Emergency Commission of Mongolia instituted strict \nemergency measures by mid-January 2020 that successfully prevented the spread of COVID-19 \n ", "3 \nin Mongolia, and launched the NDVP against COVID-19 on 11 January 2021.4 These measures \nincluded international and national travel restrictions; non-essential business closures; public \nawareness campaigns to prevent the spread of the virus; restrictions on public gatherings, \nmeetings, and celebrations; the closure of schools; and the preparation of hospitals to deal with \nthe expected surge in COVID-19 cases and the need for emergency care. The first case of \ncommunity transmission was reported on 11 November 2020, leading to the detection of several \nclusters of local transmission in the capital city, Ulaanbaatar, and several aimags (provinces). The \ngovernment immediately implemented three rounds of strict lockdowns from November 2020 to \nmid-April 2021, which helped reduce congestion in aimags and slow the spread of COVID-19 in \nUlaanbaatar. As of 12 May 2021, the Ministry of Health (MOH) reported that of the total 46,448 \nCOVID-19 cases, most of the cases (40,830) were in Ulaanbaatar and other cases (5,618) were \nin aimags. About 81.2% (1,678,198) of the target population (18 years old and above) has \nreceived their first vaccine dose and 31.1% (631,666) has received their second vaccine dose.5 \nThe risk of continued community spread remains substantial, especially in Ulaanbaatar, which is \nthe main national and international travel hub and home to half of Mongolia\u2019s population of 3.3 \nmillion. \n \n6.  Impact on Mongolia\u2019s economy. The impact of the COVID-19 crisis has been more \nsevere and prolonged on the Mongolian economy than initial expectations in 2020. Mongolia\u2019s \neconomy shrank by 5.3% in 2020, a drop of 10.5 percentage points compared with 2019. Official \njob losses reached 63,900 or 5.4% of total employment, and the unemployment rate increased \nby 1.0 percentage point to 7.6% in the second half of 2020. Export shocks led to a 9.4% \ncontraction in the mining industry, mainly because of a decline in coal and crude oil output, \ndragging down growth by 1.9 percentage points. Except for agriculture, all sectors\u2014including \ntransportation, construction, trade, and services\u2014shrank. The overall budget deficit increased \nsignificantly to 9.6% of gross domestic product in 2020 because of revenue shortfalls, fiscal \nresponse measures against COVID-19, and the contraction in gross domestic product. The \nbanking industry experienced a credit crunch throughout 2020; and private companies, especially \nmicro, small, and medium-sized enterprises that lacked access to credit, faced severe liquidity \nshortage issues. \n \n7.  Impact on poor and vulnerable groups. Although official poverty data for 2020 will be \nreleased in the second half of 2021, it is expected that COVID-19 will significantly increase the \npoverty rate from its level of 28.4% in 2018. This is anticipated given the structure of poverty in \nMongolia, its historical experience, and the recent increase in job losses to 133,000 as of Q1 2021 \nwhich is an 11.2% reduction in total jobs compared to Q4 2019. A further 27.3% of people live \njust above the poverty line and are vulnerable to falling into poverty because of shocks. Mongolia \nhas a history of economic shocks causing large increases in poverty. After a collapse in the growth \nrate to 1.2% in 2016 poverty increased by 8 percentage points to 29.6% from 2014 levels. In 2009 \nthe poverty rate increased by 3.5 points to 38.7% within 12 months when GDP contracted sharply \nby 1.3%.6 A high proportion of people living in ger (Mongolian movable, circular traditional \ndwelling) areas with poor access to health, water, sanitation, and social services are particularly \nvulnerable to COVID-19. Many ger areas are in poor urban districts of cities that suffer from \nenvironmental vulnerability, underemployment, and underinvestment in basic infrastructure.

Washington, DC.  \n ", "4 \npoor in rural areas largely depend on herding livestock and farming as their main source of income \nand their nomadic lifestyle requires targeted vaccination plans. \n \n8.  Impact on gender. Women in Mongolia are disproportionally affected by the COVID-19 \npandemic as they comprise 82% of frontline health workers and have a higher risk of exposure, \nillness, and death. This is exacerbated by the increased burden of unpaid care work at home \nbecause of the national lockdowns as well as women\u2019s jobs (such as service sector, tourism, and \nhospitality work) being more vulnerable to the impacts of COVID-19.7 In addition, the crisis has \nhad an adverse impact on gender-based violence, as the number of hotline calls and women \nresorting to shelters has increased significantly since the start of the pandemic.8 Misinformation \nregarding the effects of vaccines on fertility may increase hesitancy among the female population \nof childbearing age, affecting the expected outcome of reaching herd immunity. \n \n9.  Impact on the health system. Mongolia\u2019s health sector has made significant progress in \nimproving health outcomes in recent years. The average life expectancy at birth increased to \n70 years in 2018, up from 69 years in 2016.9 Mongolia achieved its Millennium Development Goal \ntargets in 2015 for maternal and child mortality. These hard-earned gains are under threat \nbecause of the enormous pressure the COVID-19 pandemic is placing on the country\u2019s health \ncare  system.  As  of  12  May  2021,  2,800,505  polymerase  chain  reaction  tests  have  been \nconducted; 10,531 patients have been hospitalized; and 73,589 people have undergone strict \nquarantine under medical observation (footnote 5). The increasing number of people hospitalized \nbecause of COVID-19 draws precious health resources away from the treatment of other serious \nillnesses such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer, which are the leading causes of \ndeath in Mongolia. The health system\u2019s limited human and fiscal resources are being used for \ntesting, extra remuneration for frontline health care workers and other relevant government \nworkers, and preparations for the surge in COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations, including \nexpensive intensive care capacities. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) reported that as of September \n2020,  the  government  had  allocated  an  additional  MNT850.0  billion  for  COVID-19-related \nexpenses, including MNT18.3 billion for the health sector.10 As a whole, health sector expenditure \nincreased by 26% in 2020 compared with 2019. These negative impacts make the rapid rollout of \nsafe and effective COVID-19 vaccines a vital tool that will help Mongolia stop the pandemic. \n \n10.  COVID-19 National Deployment and Vaccination Plan. The NDVP11 is an integral part \nof Mongolia's overall national COVID-19 pandemic prevention and response strategic plan.12 It is \nbased on the country\u2019s readiness assessment, utilizing the Vaccine Introduction Readiness \nAssessment  Tool  (VIRAT)  and  the  Vaccine  Readiness  Assessment  Framework  (VRAF) \n \n7  A time-use survey conducted by ADB in Mongolia among 500 respondents during April and June 2020 found that \n73% of the respondents indicated undertaking more household and care work. Female respondents spent an \naverage of 247 minutes on unpaid household work, 2.2 times more than male respondents. ADB. Mongolia: Rapid \nAssessment of Time Use in Mongolia During the COVID-19 Pandemic. (Forthcoming). \n8  Police records for Ulaanbaatar indicated a 63% increase in reported cases of domestic violence, with 3,100 during \nthe first quarter of 2020 compared with 1,900 reported during the first quarter of 2019. Most of these cases included \nphysical violence (77%), about 90% were committed in a household setting, and 93% of the victims were women. \n9  In 2016, female life expectancy was 73.5 years and male life expectancy was 65.3 years. By 2018, female life \nexpectancy was 73.9 years and male life expectancy was 65.6 years. World Bank. World Bank Indicators (accessed \n31 March 2021). \n10 Government of Mongolia, MOF. 2020.

The NDVP aims to initially vaccinate \n20% of the population (about 692,342 people), focusing on high risk groups such as frontline \nhealth care workers, government workers deployed for the COVID-19 response, and adults aged \n50 and older. This approach is aligned with recommendations from the WHO Strategic Advisory \nGroup of Experts on Immunization.14 By initially prioritizing these groups, the vaccination program \nwill achieve its impact in reducing the consequences of the pandemic even in conditions of supply \nconstraint. When subsequent consignments of the vaccine become available, up to a total of 60% \nof the population or all the adult population will be vaccinated. The prioritization of target groups \nis based on the health risks of the groups regardless of their tribal, urban, rural, and pastoral \nresidential identities or the degrees of vulnerability. The NDVP ultimately aims to vaccinate 60% \nof the population free of charge. \n \nTable 2: Mongolia\u2019s Target Population for COVID-19 Vaccination \nTarget Population\u2019s \nNumber of Target  Share of Total \nTarget Group  Population  Population (%) \n1.

Ulaanbaatar.  \n ", "6 \naddressed through projects supported by the World Bank16 and the Government of Japan.17 \nDevelopment assistance from ADB, the World Bank, the Government of Japan, UNICEF, and \nWHO  are  harmonized  through  complementary  activities  aiming  to  implement  the  NDVP. \nVaccination is carried out at the permanent units of the National Center for Communicable \nDiseases, tertiary hospitals, district hospitals, district health centers, soum (subunit of an aimag) \nhealth centers in rural provinces, and family health centers. Most of the target population\u2014\nincluding adults aged 50 and above, people with disabilities, and vulnerable people\u2014will be \nvaccinated using a fixed strategy (facility-based approach) at the nearest health facility where \nthey live to ensure that they receive proper care and emergency medical assistance in case of \nadverse  events  following  immunization.  Multidisciplinary  personnel  deployed  in  national  \nCOVID-19 response measures are given vaccines using an outreach vaccination strategy in \ntemporary  immunization  units.  A  mobile  vaccination  team  is  used  to  cover  hard-to-reach \npopulations  who  reside  in  remote  areas.  Out  of  the  planned  548 immunization  units,  50 \npermanent immunization units have been established in Ulaanbaatar City, where vaccination \nagainst COVID-19 began on 23 February 2021. The government carried out a comprehensive \nmapping of all available human resources, including additional staff from the Red Cross, retired \nstaff, and preschool health staff; and developed a detailed list of health workers who will be \nmobilized in the vaccination process, with an assigned role for each worker. Staff training has \nbeen planned and will be carried out in phases, covering about 21,000 health care workers and \n17,000 non-health sector workers, including social mobilizers, journalists, and volunteers.  \n \n12.  Joint working groups have been established to monitor the preparation of temporary and \npermanent immunization units and vaccine quality, safety, transportation, and storage on site \nduring the immunization process.18 In addition, the General Agency for Specialized Inspection \ncarries out external monitoring of the vaccination process and reports directly to the State \nEmergency Commission. Grievance mechanisms have been established at the General Agency \nfor Specialized Inspection, the Ulaanbaatar City Department of Health, and the MOH. The \ngovernment has developed a unified electronic immunization registry of COVID-19 vaccination \nrecord  with  people\u2019s  vital  information  for  daily  analysis  and  reporting.  An  effective  risk \ncommunication plan has been prepared and implemented.19 This includes a comprehensive set \nof actions, such as developing information, communication, and training materials for health care \nworkers  and  the  general  population;  training  social  mobilizers  and  influencers  to  provide \ninformation to the public on COVID-19 vaccination; and conducting active surveillance of the \npublic attitude during and after vaccination. \n \n13.  Medical waste management. An increase in medical waste (e.g., syringes, vials, and \npersonal protective equipment from vaccinators) is anticipated for national COVID-19 vaccine \ndeployment. Medical waste management is carried out following standard procedures approved \n \n16 On 11 February 2021, the World Bank approved $50.7 million additional financing for Mongolia supporting risk \ncommunication; the provision of cold chain equipment and supplies, medical supplies, personal protective equipment, \nand medicines; and the implementation and monitoring and evaluation of vaccination. The World Bank project sets \naside $18.7 million for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access \n(COVAX) Advance Market Commitment (AMC) facility, for which procurement is led by UNICEF.

Ulaanbaatar. \n ", "7 \nby the joint order of the ministers of health and environment.20 Based on the VIRAT and VRAF \nassessments validated by WHO, the NDVP outlines the need for the procurement of additional \nequipment such as autoclaves in some remote areas. In assessments done by WHO and UNICEF \non the successful national childhood immunization program, which had 99.4% coverage in 2019, \nthe  implementation  of vaccine medical  waste management\u2014including  segregation, storage, \ncollection, treatment, and disposal\u2014was adequately managed. ADB support has been used to \nimprove the central medical waste management facility in Ulaanbaatar, which can alleviate \nsudden surges in demand, through the Fifth Health Sector Development Project.21 Additionally, \ndue diligence assessments22 conducted by ADB on medical waste management systems found \nthem to be largely adequate, with some gaps in capacity in aimags and soums, particularly in \nrural areas. These gaps will be addressed through the World Bank COVID-19 emergency project \n(footnote 16) and the proposed Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) grant linked to the \nproject.23 \n \n14.  Financing needs. Based on the results of the VIRAT and VRAF, the Government of \nMongolia estimated an indicative financing need for NDVP implementation of $68.5 million\u2013\n$114.0 million, depending on the unit price of vaccines.24 The World Bank and the Government \nof Japan (footnotes 16 and 17) have committed a total of $72.2 million, of which $34.5 million is \nfor vaccines. The World Bank and the Government of Japan planned to purchase vaccines \nthrough the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) and UNICEF at a price of $7.00 per \ndose. However, according to the current COVID-19 vaccine market dashboard, the unit price for \na  single  dose  of  vaccine  is  much  higher,  ranging  from  $2.06  to  $40.00. 25 Therefore,  the \ngovernment revised its estimated financing needs to $114.0 million based on the approximate \naverage of the COVID-19 vaccines within a higher range of prices ($15.00\u2013$19.50) or $17.00 per \ndose.26 Given the delays and limited access to vaccines through COVAX, the Government of \nMongolia has requested ADB and AIIB\u2019s assistance to finance the purchase of vaccines through \nbilateral agreements. Vaccinating 60% of the population of Mongolia would require 4,549,676 \ndoses of vaccines.27 As of 12 May 2021, the government has managed to secure 2,934,940 \ndoses\u2014sufficient to cover 82% of the target population.28 \n \n15.  Government and development partner coordination. At the national level, the State \nEmergency Commission of Mongolia is a high-level commission responsible for the overall \nnational response to COVID-19 and other emergencies, as well as conducting high-level dialogue \nwith bilateral partners (footnote 4).

COVID-19 Vaccine Market Dashboard (accessed 18 May 2021).  \n26 An analysis of the indicative financing needs for the COVID-19 vaccines is in the Country National Vaccine Allocation \nPlan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n27 This includes two doses per person, with a 15% wastage rate of vaccines based on WHO guidance. \n28 This includes 90,540 doses from COVAX, 150,000 doses donated by the Government of India; 300,000 doses \ndonated by the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, 2,354,400 purchased by the government (2,300,000 \nSinopharm and 45,000 Sputnik) and 40,000 purchased by the private sector. Under COVAX first round allocations \nthere is a total of 183,540 vaccine earmarked for Mongolia.  \n ", "8 \ndevelopment partners in the health sector. In Mongolia, ADB is the lead development partner in \nthe health sector and is a member of the National Coordination Committee together with the World \nBank, WHO, UNICEF, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency. To implement the NDVP, \nthe government seeks additional support from other development partners for its strategy to fully \nvaccinate 60% of the population, which will not be covered by the COVAX Advance Market \nCommitment (AMC), the World Bank, and the Government of Japan. In particular, the government \nseeks support for direct procurement from the manufacturers of safe and effective COVID-19 \nvaccines to speedily deploy vaccines and avoid forecast delays in delivery through COVAX AMC \nand UNICEF. \n \n16.  ADB  support  for  Mongolia\u2019s  health  sector  and  engagement  in  the  COVID-19 \nresponse and vaccination. The Government of Mongolia and ADB have a long and important \npartnership  in  the  health  sector.  Since  1993,  ADB  has  provided  7  loans,  10  grants,  and \n19 technical assistance projects in Mongolia\u2019s health sector. The government has requested ADB \nto provide support for a rapid response to COVID-19 because of ADB\u2019s significant and impactful \nengagement in the health sector. ADB has responded to Mongolia\u2019s immediate needs for medical \nequipment  and  laboratory  diagnostics  to  detect  and  screen  for  COVID-19  by  repurposing \n$1.4 million in savings under an ongoing loan (footnote 21), which includes an improved medical \nwaste management facility; providing $2.5 million in assistance from the Asia Pacific Disaster \nResponse  Fund;  mobilizing  small-scale  technical  assistance  of  $225,000;  processing  an \nemergency assistance loan of $30.0 million; and providing a policy-based loan of $100.0 million.29 \nADB is currently processing a complementary $5.0 million grant proposed for JFPR funding to \nbuild capacity for COVID-19 vaccine delivery. ADB has also provided technical assistance of \n$400,000 to address and prevent domestic violence during the COVID-19 crisis through the \nprovision of personal protective equipment and medical equipment for shelters and one-stop \nservice centers enhancing access to emergency services during the crisis.30 \n \n17.  Access criteria for the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility. Mongolia fulfills the \ncriteria for accessing the APVAX resource envelope: (i) clear adverse socioeconomic impacts of \nthe pandemic in Mongolia, as shown by robust economic analysis; (ii) a needs assessment \nconducted with support from UNICEF and WHO, using the internationally accepted VIRAT and \nVRAF assessments that served as a basis for the comprehensive national COVID-19 vaccination \nstrategy and plan, which prioritizes the vaccination of high risk and vulnerable groups of the \npopulation,  and  reflects  the  management  of  incremental  medical  waste  and  procurement \narrangements; and (iii) strong leadership and coordinated actions led by the government in \nimplementing the national COVID-19 response and the vaccination strategy and plan, including \nthe establishment of effective development partner coordination mechanisms. The government \nhas secured Mongolia\u2019s participation in COVAX AMC and is coordinating its efforts with ADB, \nUNICEF, WHO, and the World Bank. To facilitate rapid procurement, the government plans to \nutilize  retroactive  financing  and/or  advance  contracting  to  speedily  secure  APVAX-eligible \nvaccines (Table 5). \n \n18.  To rapidly access COVID-19 vaccines amid severely constrained global supplies, the \ngovernment  intends  to  purchase  COVID-19  vaccines  directly  from  manufacturers.  The \ngovernment has mandated that national (domestic) vaccine authorization or approval for use will \nrely on the emergency use listing by WHO for approving COVID-19 vaccines or approval by a \n \n29 ADB.

Project Description \n \n19.  Impact and outcome. The Government of Mongolia officially requested ADB\u2019s financial \nsupport for securing safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for the people of Mongolia.34 The \nprimary objective of the project is to increase the availability of the APVAX-eligible vaccines for \nthe priority population, as defined by the government in its NDVP. The project will be aligned with \nthe RRC component of APVAX, including the list of eligible items and agreed list of eligible \nexpenditures. The project supports with the following impact: morbidity and mortality of severe \nacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reduced.35 The project will have the following outcome: \npriority population vaccinated against COVID-19.36 The project will support the implementation of \nthe NDVP and contribute to the government\u2019s efforts to immunize at least 30% of the population, \nwhich represents priority groups. \n \n20.  Output. The output of the project will be COVID-19 vaccines for priority population are \nefficiently procured and delivered. The delivery of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines that meet \nAPVAX eligibility criteria, with AIIB cofinancing, will immunize at least 30% of the population. The \nproject will cover eligible expenditure under the RRC pertaining to international transportation of \nthe vaccines from the manufacturers to Mongolia. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n21.   The APVAX project builds on ADB\u2019s health system strengthening assistance to Mongolia \nand  responds  to  Mongolia\u2019s  need to  address the  global  emergency  that  is  the  COVID-19 \npandemic. The project contributes to regional public goods37 through reduction of COVID-19 risks \nto neighboring countries to facilitate safer movement of goods and people and enhanced trade \nand investment. \n \n22.  The  government  will  utilize ADB  financing  for the  purchase  of  COVID-19  vaccines. \nAddressing essential vaccine rollout pillars will be covered by the government with financial and \ntechnical support from the World Bank, WHO, UNICEF, and the proposed ADB-administered \n \n31 Government of Mongolia, MOH. 2021.

The government has requested from ADB a regular loan and a concessional loan in the \naggregate amount of $19.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The government has \nalso requested a loan of $21.0 million from AIIB. The ADB regular loan of $9.5 million for the RRC \nwill have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years. The ADB concessional loan of \n$9.5 million for the RRC will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years. The ADB \nregular loan for the RRC will have an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nyear; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreements. The ADB \nconcessional loan for the RRC will have an annual interest rate of 2.0% per year; and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreements. The government has made its own \nindependent decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility in relation to the \nregular and concessional ordinary capital resources loans and has given an undertaking that this \nwas not made based on any advice from ADB. The AIIB loan will be partially administered by \nADB. It will jointly finance vaccine supply contracts, including logistics and transportation, which \nmeet the eligibility criteria under APVAX.39 Its terms and conditions will be described in a loan \nagreement between AIIB and the government.40 Approval of the AIIB loan is expected shortly \n \n38 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39 The eligibility of vaccines for APVAX financing will adhere to the criteria stated in para. 29 (including footnotes 28, \n29, and 30) of the APVAX policy paper and para. 8 (including footnotes 11 and 12) of the approved APVAX \namendment paper; (footnotes 1 and 32). \n40 AIIB. 2019.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n26.  The MOH will be the executing agency for the project, supervised by the State Emergency \nCommission (footnote 4). The MOH will provide technical support for the implementation of the \nNDVP through the  National  Coordination  Committee,  which  includes  development  partners \nproviding  COVID-19  support.  The  executing  agency  and  these  mechanisms  will  ensure \ncoordination of the project with ADB and other development partners. Vaccines will be purchased \nthrough direct procurement from the manufacturer of APVAX-eligible COVID-19 vaccines to \nspeedily  procure  vaccines  and  avoid  forecast  delays  in  procurement  through  COVAX  and \nUNICEF because of the severely restricted global supply of vaccines. To strengthen project \nreadiness and avoid parallel project implementation arrangements, the project implementation \nunit (PIU) responsible for the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Health Sector Development projects will be \nresponsible for the implementation of this project.41 The implementation period will be from \nJune 2021 to December 2023. Implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 5 and \ndescribed in detail in the PAM. The procurement of ADB-eligible vaccines will follow the APVAX \npolicy requirements. Value for money will be achieved by securing multiple types of APVAX-\neligible vaccines on reasonable commercial terms and through close monitoring of contract \nimplementation to ensure timely delivery. Retroactive financing arrangements are expected to be \nutilized after loan effectiveness for procurement of vaccines. \n \nTable 5: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \n Implementation period  June 2021\u2013December 20  23 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2023 \nEstimated loan closing date  31 December 2023 \nManagement \n(i) Oversight bodies  1.

Economic and Financial Viability \n   \n27.  In Mongolia, COVID-19 has negatively impacted economic activity, including declines in \ndomestic  consumption,  production,  investment,  trade,  and  tourism,  largely  because  of  the \nstringent containment measures introduced both locally and globally. If allowed to continue, \nCOVID-19 will, in the short term, overwhelm the existing health system, which will be unable to \ncope with the simultaneous burden of treatment of noncommunicable diseases such as heart \ndisease, stroke, and cancer, in addition to COVID-19. This will lead to highly negative effects on \nhuman capital development. The immunization of 60% of the population will help achieve herd \nimmunity, save lives, allow the resumption of economic activities, promote trade, and build human \ncapital. Project outputs are public goods with no opportunity for cost recovery, so no financial \nviability assessment is required. The government has estimated an indicative financing need for \nNDVP implementation through the VIRAT and VRAF assessments and has conducted mapping \nof funding sources.42 \n \nB.  Governance \n \n28.  Based  on  the  financial  management  assessments  of  the  MOH  and  subsequent \nassessments  carried  out  under  the  current  project,  the  MOH  has  adequate  accounting \nprofessionals as well as computerized financial accounting and reporting systems. Procedures \non the flow of accounting, financial, and project physical progress related to the current project \nactivities are available. All the agencies have clearly defined responsibilities, with accountability \nassigned  to  different  units  at  different  levels  of  authority.  The  MOF  will  oversee  financial \nmanagement, including internal audits and performance audits, of the NDVP following national \nlaws and regulations. The MOH will oversee the management of transport, storage, and security \nof vaccines, following national vaccination program guidelines. \n \n29.  The Mongolia National Audit Office will arrange annual audits for the project. The financial \nmanagement assessments concluded that the financial management systems in the MOH meet \ngovernment requirements in terms of staffing, accounting, and internal control. The PIU staff will \n \n42 Vaccine Needs Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "13 \nimplement the project in compliance with ADB\u2019s policy, operation, and procedural requirements. \nThe assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is moderate. \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOH.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 38). \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n31.  Poverty and social. The project will improve emergency preparedness during epidemics \nand pandemics, and health workers\u2019 safety in hospitals in Mongolia. It will directly benefit people \nwho are at high risk of death from COVID-19 infection, and about 200,000 frontline workers, \nespecially those with professions that put them at occupational risk because of the COVID-19 \npandemic. In addition, people with disabilities, people who suffer from chronic diseases, and \nvulnerable groups requiring social assistance will benefit from the vaccine rollout (Table 2). \n \n32.  Gender. The project is classified some gender elements. Vaccination with safe and \neffective COVID-19 vaccines will reduce illness and deaths among women. Priority groups for \nvaccination  under the  NDVP  include  health care  workers  (82%  of  whom  are  women)  and \neducators (96% of all teachers and workers at preschool education establishments, and 81.2% \nof  basic  teachers  from  the  general  secondary  schools  in  Mongolia,  are  women).  Further, \noperations staff working in 35 shelters and one-stop service centers, which provide a safe haven \nfor victims of domestic violence, will be included as part of the prioritized population under the \nproject, ensuring accessibility to such services during the crisis. Data generated through the \nimplementation of the NDVP will be disaggregated by sex, priority group, and occupation for more \neffective targeting of vulnerable groups. Vaccination of the priority population will help reduce the \nburden of women\u2019s unpaid and domestic work resulting from lockdowns, and help reduce gender-\nbased violence at home, which has spiked during the pandemic. Proposed complementary ADB-\nadministered JFPR grant assistance to Mongolia for supporting vaccine delivery systems and \ncapacity building will target women for awareness raising, capacity building, and training for \nCOVID-19 vaccine administration (footnote 23). \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n33.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.43 \n \n34.  Environment (category C). The project will procure supplies but will not entail any civil \nworks or activities that may cause major adverse impacts on the environment. Under the Fifth \nHealth Sector Development Project (footnote 21), medical waste management capacity has \nincreased, which will contribute to medical waste management for COVID-19 vaccines. The \nproject will follow national regulations on medical waste. Due diligence assessments conducted \nby ADB on medical waste management systems found them to be largely adequate, with some \ngaps in capacity in aimags and soums, particularly in rural areas (footnote 22). These gaps will \nbe filled by (i) the procurement of autoclaves under the World Bank COVID-19 emergency project \n(footnote 16); (ii) training for health workers on medical waste management and occupational \nhealth  and safety  under the  proposed JFPR  grant  linked  to the  project  (footnote  23);  and \n(iii) monitoring of medical waste, which is also supported through the proposed JFPR grant. \n \n \n43 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "14 \n35.  Involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  project \ncomponents will not involve civil works and will not trigger any land acquisition or involuntary \nresettlement impacts. The project will not cause adverse or differential impacts on ethnic groups, \nand they will benefit equally from the proposed vaccination of the priority population. \n \nE.  Procurement \n \n36.  The procurement of goods, works, and services will be carried out in a manner consistent \nwith simplified and expedient procedures permitted under the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time) and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as \namended from time to time) and as permitted under APVAX. Since the project will be financed \nunder  APVAX,  ADB  member  country  eligibility  restrictions  will  be  waived  and  universal \nprocurement will apply. ADB will be the lead cofinancier and partially administer the AIIB loan, \nADB Procurement Policy will apply to all procurement. All procurement packages will be jointly \nfinanced by ADB and AIIB. To expedite procurement, both vaccines and international logistics will \nbe procured using the direct contracting method. Vaccines will be purchased through bilateral \nagreements with manufacturers of APVAX-eligible COVID-19 vaccines. The government will be \nresponsible for arranging the transport of the vaccines from the countries of origin to Mongolia. \n \n37.  A procurement risk assessment was carried out for the project and rated the procurement \nrisk high. While the MOH has worked with ADB for many years and has implemented several \nADB-financed projects, instances of noncompliance have occurred, including mis-procurement. \nIn addition, the COVID-19 vaccine supply market is severely constrained, with few manufacturers, \nwhile the demand is extremely high. To mitigate these risks, (i) the government should identify \nmultiple sources of vaccine supply to spread risk; (ii) all direct procurements to be funded by ADB \nand AIIB (including candidate contracts for retroactive financing) will be subject to ADB prior \nreview; (iii) an existing PIU familiar with ADB procurement rules and procedures will be used for \nthis project; and (iv) a vaccine procurement expert will be hired to assist the MOH in procurement, \ncontract negotiation, and implementation. \n \n38.  Value for money in procurement will be achieved by (i) selecting candidate vaccines that \nare eligible for APVAX and best suited to the domestic logistics supply chain and distribution \nfacilities;  (ii)  engaging  with manufacturers that  have  advantageous vaccine  availability  and \ndelivery  timelines;  and  (iii)  entering  into  agreements  with  terms  and  conditions  that  are \nreasonable, bearing in mind the currently constrained market for COVID-19 vaccines worldwide. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n39.  Considering the unpredictable nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, risks and mitigation \nmeasures will evolve as the vaccines are rolled out and implementation is monitored. Significant \nrisks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 6 and described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.44 \n \nTable 6: Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nDelays in the delivery of vaccines  The  government  will  use  bilateral  arrangements  to  secure  direct \nbecause of the high global demand  procurement  of APVAX-eligible  vaccines  from several  manufacturers. \nand manufacturing bottlenecks  Additional vaccines could be procured through the COVAX AMC as \nMongolia has secured its participation.  \n \n44 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "15 \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nDelays with the EUL of vaccines by  Vaccines that the government is negotiating to purchase through bilateral \nWHO, which is a consideration of  arrangements and the COVAX AMC are already listed on the WHO EUL \nthe government and one of the first  and approved by the national Human Medicine Council or being assessed \ncriteria for APVAX eligibility   and soon to be included in the WHO EUL. \nDifficulties with the airfreight  The government will use MIAT Mongolian airlines for airfreight shipment of \nshipment of vaccines from the site of  vaccines. Airfreight shipment of vaccines will be covered by the APVAX \nmanufacturers to Ulaanbaatar   rapid response component. \nDifficulties with ensuring the storage  The government purchased and installed 26 refrigerators with 5 ultra-cold \nof vaccines with super-cold freeze  freezing capacities at the national vaccine storage in Ulaanbaatar and in \nrequirements   each of the 21 aimag (province) centers.
