In response, policy makers in \ndeveloped and developing countries are prioritizing education, lifelong learning, job training, and \nskills development linked to growth strategies. Strong links are needed between the world of \nwork and training providers to match skills development with employment. Policy makers are \nacknowledging the importance of anticipating and building capacity for future needs.1  \n \n2.  A  number  of  Asian  countries  have  reached  middle-income  status.  Improving \ncompetitiveness to escape the \u201cmiddle-income trap\u201d entails strengthening skills that embody \nnew technologies and innovation.2 However, the adoption of green growth policies is likely to \nrequire additional skills to succeed in the labor market. Several governments are building solid \npolicy foundations toward green growth and need to prepare for the growth of green jobs \nthrough responsive education and training strategies.3  \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) Education Sector Operations Plan4 seeks to align \nADB support in education with the needs and priorities of its developing member countries \n(DMCs)  and  strengthen  quality,  inclusiveness,  and  relevance  of  education.  The  plan \nemphasizes that ADB will support DMCs to diversify and expand higher education and technical \nand vocational education and training to match labor market needs and increase employment.   \nIn the backdrop of structural transformation spurred by a number of interrelated issues, the \ntechnical assistance (TA) will address the importance of dynamic skills development systems for \nmiddle-income economies and for a \u201cgreening\u201d Asia. The TA was discussed at the South Asia \nDepartment  consultation  mission  in  India  in  April  2011  and  the  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment  Department  mission  to  Indonesia  in  June  2011.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Growth  rebounded  robustly  in  Asia  after  the  global  financial  crisis\u2014economies \nrecovered faster than expected. However, to maintain these growth rates, important concerns \ninclude increasing employment, facilitating technology absorption for global competitiveness, \nand curbing rising inequality. A key factor affecting rising inequality is rapid globalization, which \nraises skill premiums.5 Economies need to deepen skills to serve knowledge-based industries, \nprovide  high  skills  to  support  technology  absorption  and  further  innovation,  and  broaden \nopportunities  for  skills  development  in  new  and  emerging  technology  areas.  Enhancing \nopportunities for skills training, particularly for poor and middle-income groups, women, and \ndisadvantaged students in line with the needs of fast-growing industries, will bring employment \nbenefits and higher incomes and act as an important contributor to inclusive growth. Youth \nunemployment and underemployment and obsolete skills are urgent issues to be addressed.  \n                                                 \n1 International Labour Organization. 2010. A Skilled Workforce for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth\u2013A G20 \nTraining Strategy. Geneva. \n2 Analysts have described \u201cmiddle-income trap\u201d as one where developing economies are not able to move beyond \ngrowth based on low-cost labor advantages in manufacturing for exports to growth that is capital and skill intensive, \nsupports expanding domestic markets and the services sector, and brings greater value addition. \n3  ADB.

East Asia and Pacific Economic Outlook. Vol. 1. \nWashington, DC. \n ", "2 \n \n \n5.  Sustaining economic growth without compromising the environment is a policy challenge \nthat Asia has begun to address. Awareness is increasing that green growth approaches are \neconomically and politically feasible and profitable. A number of studies estimate that by 2030 \n100 million green jobs6 will be available worldwide7\u2014about 2% of the global workforce. Of \nthese, 50 million green jobs are anticipated in Asia. Green stimulus packages after the financial \ncrisis led to increased public investment in green infrastructure\u2014public transport, low-carbon \nenergy production, smart electricity grids, energy efficiency of public buildings, and water and \nsanitation infrastructure\u2014including extensive employment opportunities.8 These include workers \nmanufacturing fuel-efficient cars, solar panel technicians, green-building construction workers, \nrenewable energy factory workers, and green professionals such as energy auditors. Previously \nattributed to eco-sectors, green jobs now include jobs in industries with greening potential.  \n \n6.  Investment in the green economy will be good for the environment and for business; it \nwill help position Asia for sustained rapid growth.9  If done correctly, moving to a low carbon \nworld is expected to realize three significant benefits: reduced emissions, higher productivity of \nthe economy, and inclusive growth. Green jobs have great potential, however, they do not need \nto  automatically  be  quality  jobs,  constituting  decent  work,  i.e.,  with  adequate  wages,  safe \nworking conditions, job security, career prospects, and worker rights. The danger of \u201cgreen \nwashing\u201d where only nominal support to environmental goals actually provides very poor quality \nemployment is real. An example could be poor-quality recycling of electronics, which may give \nrise to employment in hazardous conditions. The use of unskilled labor in biofuel and biomass \nproduction  may  give  rise  to  numerous  jobs  but  at  subsistence  wages  and  poor  working \nconditions. In this case, green jobs do not constitute quality employment. Thus ensuring that \ngreen jobs are also \u201cdecent\u201d jobs in pursuit of inclusive growth is important. For example, \nproviding energy access to rural India and a distributed model of generating jobs that are not \nurban centric will support inclusive growth.   \n \n7.  Education and training systems10 need to meet the needs of labor markets including \nthose of green jobs. Enterprise surveys by the World Bank since 2000 reveal that 50% of firms \nsurveyed in East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific are concerned with inadequate worker \neducation  and  skills,  compared  with  25%  of  firms  surveyed  in  member  countries  of  the \nOrganisation of Economic Co-operation and Development.11 The survey found unemployment \nof graduates and fairly long time intervals to fill professional vacancies. These are symptomatic \nof education and training systems not being in step with skills needs of high growth sectors. \nSkills training initiatives need to be supplemented with effective skills forecasting models that \nare  responsive  to  industry  plans  and  requirements.  Responses  to  such  a  \u201ccrisis  of \ncompetencies\u201d by the private sector has led to the creation of interesting new skill models. \n                                                 \n6  Green jobs contribute to preserving or restoring the quality of the environment and can be in diverse sectors such \nas energy supply, recycling,  agriculture, construction, and transportation. They reduce the environmental footprint \nof economic activity and help cut consumption of energy, raw materials, and water through high-efficiency \nstrategies to decarbonize the economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to minimize or avoid altogether all \nforms of waste and pollution, and to protect and restore ecosystems and biodiversity (United Nations Environment \nProgramme). \n7  International Labour Organization. 2008.

Stepping up Skills: For More Jobs and Higher Productivity. Washington, DC. ", "3 \n \n \n8.  Countries are evaluating the costs of adopting green growth measures and industries \nare being encouraged to move to green production systems through incentives or regulatory \nrequirements. Training is required in new and redefined skills to prepare the workforce for a \ngreen economy. New green jobs will become available and job substitution will result from the \ngreening of corporations and the shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources.12 Education and \ntraining institutions do not yet have effective response strategies for green jobs. Training course \nofferings for green skills need to be developed in sectors that are key drivers of growth and high \nemployment such as building and construction, transport, waste management, energy, and \nhospitality.  Green  industries  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  are  currently  fragmented.  University \nofferings  lack  cross-disciplinary  breadth  and  faculty  to  train  future  workers  in  technical, \neconomic, social, and managerial challenges in green industry.  \n \n9.  Industry and business have initiated steps to train workers for green processes and \nproducts;  however,  governments,  industries,  and  educational  institutions  have  not  yet \ndeveloped coordinated actions to prepare the workforce in middle and higher green skills. As \ncountries in Asia and the Pacific put in place national policies and strategies for climate change \nadaptation, mitigation, and green growth, the capacities needed have not been adequately \nanalyzed. Furthermore, developing countries have not had sufficient coordination and dialogue \non harmonizing skill standards for green occupations. Regional entities, such as the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations, are supportive of bringing together business leaders in green \nindustries to network. International commitment to clean and green growth are requiring a new \ncadre of green professionals in fields like assessment, reporting, and certification. Currently they \nare primarily from developed countries; developing countries in Asia have not yet developed a \nprofessional skills base. Knowledge sharing and exposure to how western countries developed \nthese green certification professional cadres are insufficient. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be improved and increased availability of job-oriented courses and skills \ntraining, including for green occupations. By 2017, the number of courses and training curricula \nin skills including for green occupations will be improved and increased in four countries. The \noutcome will be increased knowledge and capacity of four DMCs in matching education and \nskills training to jobs, including for green occupations. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will help the DMCs put in place timely and effective policies and strategies for \nskills development, including for green growth. It will facilitate dialogue and networking between \nthe public sector, business and sector councils, industry and occupational associations, and \nemployee associations to assess gaps in policy and practice for the development of skills and to \nanticipate future needs. The TA will address both technology-oriented high-end skills as well as \nmiddle and lower-end skills to ensure that issues of inclusiveness are addressed in the context \nof rapidly growing economic sectors, including greening sectors.  \n \n                                                 \n12 United Nations Environment Programme. 2008.

The TA will lead to improved knowledge and enhanced capacity in the DMCs to create \nan  adequate  skills  base  to  support  growth  and  employment  and  serve  green  jobs  in  key \nindustries. Education and training institutions will become aware of best practices for curricula \nand  training  approaches  to  respond  to  skill  needs  in  key  industries.  The  TA  will  address \nindustries  with  potential  for  high  employment,  growth,  and  greening  (e.g.,  building  and \nconstruction, transport, waste management, energy, and hospitality).   \n \n13.  Four countries from among India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam will be \nselected for this TA, subject to the agreement of the respective governments. Appropriate skills \nfor middle-income economies and strategies for increasing competitiveness are relevant to \nthese countries, which  have initiated green economy initiatives. In Southeast Asia, Indonesia \nand Viet Nam have made considerable progress in education and can further strengthen skills \ndevelopment to meet labor market needs. In South Asia, India and Sri Lanka give high priority to \nskills development and employability. Uzbekistan is giving importance to skills and job creation \nin its economic stimulus initiatives.  While a common methodology and approach will be used \nfor the four countries, the in-depth country reports will respond to the specific context of each \ncountry and take into account economic growth, structural transformation, and transition to \ngreen economy policy priorities articulated by the countries.  \n \n14.  Output 1. An analysis of labor market needs, skills mismatch, and demand for skills for \njobs, including green occupations, in selected industries will be completed for the four countries. \nFour country reports outlining opportunities for strengthening skills training systems to increase \njobs  for  men  and  women  will  be  disseminated  and  discussed  with  government  and  other \nstakeholders by the end of 2013.  \n \n15.  Output  2.  Lessons  from  global  best  practices  of  skills  development  systems  in \nindustry-specific environments will be documented. Two case studies on improving employment \nfor men and women through appropriate skills formation will be presented and discussed with \nthe four countries by 2013. Four country workshops including one with regional participation, will \naddress major reform areas for skills development, including skills for green jobs held.   \n \n16.  Output 3. Recommendations will be prepared in each of the four countries for policy and \nstrategy options for skills development for jobs for men and women, including green jobs. Four \npolicy briefs will be prepared in consultation with business and industry and discussed by 2013. \nTwo of the four country workshops held with interministerial collaboration, and exchange of \nexperiences and knowledge will be undertaken (2012, 2013). \n \n17.  Output 4.  Recommendations will be prepared for the four countries on strengthening \nthe participation of women and disadvantaged youth in skills training for improved job prospects, \nincluding in green occupations. Guidance notes on measures to increase the share of women \nand disadvantaged youth in skills training in high growth sector occupations including green jobs \nwill be prepared for the four countries by 2013.    \n \n18.  While the TA will support the DMCs in improving skills development strategies, it will \nalso inform ADB operations in this area. The TA will help ADB operations departments identify \nnew business opportunities for innovative skills development projects with the DMCs. The TA \noutputs will result in a major publication that combines four in-depth country studies, review of \ninternational best practices, proposals for next practices in the DMCs, and a clear articulation of \npolicy options that could be applicable to other countries. ", "5 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $950,000 and will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 30 months from October 2011 to April 2014. ADB will \nbe the executing agency and the Poverty Reduction, Gender and Social Development Division \nof the Regional and Sustainable Development Department will lead TA implementation and \nadministration. The TA will finance the services of a consulting team selected through a firm to \nprovide 18 person-months of international and 48 person-months of national consulting. An \nexperienced international expert on skills and workforce development with experience in green \njobs will lead the team. Other inputs include support for country analysis, compilation of case \nstudies, workshops, conferences, and travel. ADB will engage all consultants in accordance with \nthe Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time).   \n \n21.  The  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  (Ministry  of  Strategy  and  Finance)  is \nconsidering parallel financing of about $300,00014 through Korea Eximbank (KEXIM); this will be \nconfirmed after TA approval. Close coordination will be ensured between ADB and KEXIM. \nActive  consultations  will  be  undertaken  with  representatives  of  the  International  Labour \nOrganization engaged in the topics of skills, employment, and green jobs. Other agencies such \nas the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, United Nations Environment \nProgramme,  and  World  Bank  will  be  consulted  and  invited  to  appropriate  events.  Such \ninternational organizations will be knowledge partners of ADB by participating in events, and \nsharing information and data.   \n \n22.  Institutions and government representatives from participating DMCs will be substantial \nstakeholders in TA implementation. They will be consulted during detailed country work and be \ninvited  to  national  and  regional  workshops  and  conferences.  The  TA  team  will  facilitate \nparticipation from business and industry associations, private sector training entities, and other \nrelevant institutions as appropriate during implementation. Vocational education and training \nsystem leaders, managers, and college directors will be consulted and invited to key workshops. \nKey agencies involved in documenting data on green jobs, education and skills training, and \noccupational standards will be consulted.  \n \n  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $950,000 on a grant basis for \nEducation and Skills for Inclusive Growth and Green Jobs, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n  \n                                                 \n14 The activities likely to be supported by KEXIM include an international skills forum, compilation of case studies from \nthe Republic of Korea, support for study tours by DMC representatives to the Republic of Korea and industry \nlinkages on skills development. These will be finalized and incorporated in a record of discussion between ADB \nand KEXIM after TA approval. The KEXIM contribution will be over and above the ADB financing; there will be no \nduplication of funding of activities or outputs. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nPerformance  Data Sources/ \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nAvailability of job- By 2017, number of courses  Annual reports of  Economies of the DMCs \noriented courses and  and training curricula in skills  Ministry of Education  continue to grow \nskills training  including for green  and Ministry of Labor   \nimproved and  occupations improved and    Education and training \nincreased, including  increased in four countries  Reports by World Bank,  institutions in the DMCs \nfor green occupations  (no baseline data available  International Labour  mobilize additional resources \n  as of now)  Organization, and  for new approaches to skills \nUnited Nations  development \nagencies   \n   Risks \nReports and surveys  The DMCs are not investing \npublished by industry  sufficiently in skills or in \nassociations  moving to green economies  \nOutcome  By 2013    Assumptions \nKnowledge and  DMC knowledge of  Knowledge products  Countries in Asia continue to \ncapacity of four DMCs  successful policy options to  developed and  grow and adopt green \nincreased in matching  strengthen skills training  disseminated  strategies  \neducation and skills  systems, including for green     \ntraining to jobs,  jobs, increased  Strategy and plan  DMCs seize the opportunity \nincluding for green    documents of the  to develop and renew \noccupations  New approaches to  government (ministries  strategies for skilling the \n  education and training  of education, labor,  workforce, including for \nstrategy for increasing  and employment)  green jobs \nemployment, including in     \ngreen occupations, drafted  Reports of education  Risks \nor refined by the four  and training institutions  Strategy development is \nparticipating countries   and private training  piecemeal and does not \nproviders  adopt a holistic approach  \nTA reports \nOutputs        Assumptions \n1.
