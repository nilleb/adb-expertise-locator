INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Maldives (the Government) has requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building for the National Statistical \nSystem.1 The TA is in line with ADB's strategic focus under its country strategy and program \n(2002\u20132004), with the aim to strengthen the Government's institutional capacity for public sector \nmanagement and policy planning, and has been in ADB's  assistance pipeline.2 The Fact-\nFinding Mission from ADB visited the Maldives from 23 to 27 February 2003. The Mission \nreached an understanding with the Government on the justification and priority for the TA, its \npurpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost and financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference for the TA consultants. The TA framework is given in Appendix 1.  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Economic and social statistics are the basic requirements for monitoring any country's \ndevelopment progress and formulating economic and social development policies and programs. \nThe Maldives has made significant progress in improving the coverage and quality of economic \nand social statistics. However, many challenges remain. Due partly to the Maldives' dispersed \ngeographical setting, the Government has a very decentralized statistics system: each line \nministry collects and analyzes concerned data according to its own methodology, frequency, \nand quality control measures. This has led to a significant divergence in the concept and quality \nof data and inconsistency and incomparability of the data.   \n \n3.  Due to its narrow industrial base and dependence on the external sector, the Maldives' \neconomy is vulnerable to external developments. The Maldives is particularly influenced by the \nimpact of global economic trends and the security situation in neighboring regions on tourism \nand the development of international tuna prices. The fragility of the economy accentuates the \nneed for enhancing the country's  capacity to monitor its economic performance in a timely \nmanner and thus to develop immediate policy responses. This will be especially important if the \nMaldives graduates from the least developed country status.  \n \n4.  ADB and the Government entered into a poverty partnership agreement (PPA) in March \n2002. In line with the Millenium Development Goals, the PPA defines a long-term vision and \nsets out short-, medium-, and long-term priorities and targets in various aspects of poverty, i.e., \nincome poverty, human poverty, and macroeconomic and sectoral development. To effectively \nimplement the PPA, the Maldives needs to enhance its capacity to monitor its progress in \nachieving the priorities and targets. \n \n5.  Within the Government, the Statistics Section of the Ministry of Planning and National \nDevelopment (MPND) is the focal point of national statistics. However, the decentralized system \nhas hampered MPND's efforts to consolidate and integrate data and analyze them for policy \nfeedback in a satisfactory manner. The Statistics Section has had insufficient cooperation from \nother ministries and the private sector, as there is concern about the independence of the \nStatistics Section and the mechanism to ensure the proper confidential use of the data provided.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1   The TA was formerly called as Establishment of Department/Bureau of Statistics.  \n2   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 20 January 2003.  ", "2 \n6.  Currently, the Maldives has no law to guide the Government's statistical activities. It has \nonly statistical rules and regulations. The absence of the proper legal framework is a key \nconstraint on the Statistics Section's ability to undertake statistical exercises, because there is \nno legal mechanism to ensure, and enforce as necessary,  cooperation from the relevant \nministries, agencies, and private sector entities. The concern on  confidentiality  is a major \nsetback of the absence of the appropriate legal framework. \n \n7.  ADB has provided two TAs to develop the Maldives' national accounts system.3 The TAs \nfocused primarily on developing the methodology for gross domestic product (GDP) statistics. \nThese TAs were satisfactorily  implemented and  resulted in significant improvements  in the \nquality of GDP statistics. However, key challenges (paras. 5\u20136) identified under the TAs are yet \nto be addressed, as these were beyond the scope of the TAs. \n \n8.  A key lesson learned from the previous TAs indicates the need for continued support for \nhuman resource development. Human capacity in the Statistics Section is still weak despite the \ntraining provided under the TAs, because (i) staff are not equipped with basic statistics skills or \nunderstanding in economics or relevant fields, due mainly  to the unavailability of in-country \ntraining opportunities in these areas; and (ii) the training provided was  confined to specific \ntechnical  aspects.  The  benefits  of  assistance  will  be  realized  only  if  a  mechanism  for \nsustainable and cost-effective in-house training is established. One approach will be training of \ntrainers in the MPND. The trainers need to acquire both theoretical and technical knowledge of \neconomics and statistics; this will be best undertaken by overseas studies and on-the-job-\ntraining (OJT) because such opportunities are not available in the Maldives. At the same time, \nthe  possibility  of  establishing  in-country  training  courses  in  the  Maldives'  postsecondary \neducation institutions should be explored.  \n \n9.  In  the  Maldives,  donor  agencies have made concerted efforts to build capacity for \neconomic and social statistics. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been \nactive in poverty statistics. In 1998, UNDP helped the Government undertake a comprehensive \npoverty and  vulnerability survey in 1998 that covered all inhabited  islands and wide-ranging \npoverty and social statistics. This was the first nationwide survey on poverty, and proved to be \nan important exercise in understanding the poverty situation and formulating policy responses. \nTo  further  strengthen  the  Government's  poverty  monitoring  capacity,  UNDP  is  currently \nproviding  additional  assistance,  which  will  complement  ADB's  assistance  in  promoting \ninstitutional and legal development and enhancing technical capacity for economic and social \nstatistics.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The purpose of the TA is to enhance the Government's institutional and human capacity \nin collecting, consolidating, and analyzing economic and social data. This will  enable the \nGovernment to develop more responsive and effective economic growth and poverty reduction \npolicies and programs and to monitor the country's progress in achieving the goals and targets \nin the PPA and the Millenium Development Goals.  \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1996.

Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Maldives for Further Development \nof a System of National Accounts. Manila.  ", "    3 \n11.  The TA outputs will be (i)  establishment of an independent department of statistics \nsupported with an appropriate legislative framework, including preparation of a statistics law for \nthe department on the basis of the existing statistical rules and regulations; (ii) strengthening of \nthe technical capacity for key economic and social statistics, particularly national accounts \nstatistics; and (iii) upgrading of human resource in statistics required for the full functioning of \nthe new department, through overseas studies and OJT and in-county seminars/workshops \ntargeted at the concerned Government staff,  including those in the atolls. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The key activities of the TA will be (i) assistance to the Government in  institutional \nrearrangements and legal framework development; (ii) knowledge transfer regarding technical \naspects of economic and social statistics; (iii) in-country and OJT training for MPND staff on the \ntechnical aspects of economic statistics; and (iv) overseas studies and OJT for selected staff \naiming at a sustainable in-house training mechanism.  \n \n13.  For the institutional and legal aspects, the TA will first develop a proposal for an \nindependent department of statistics. Once the proposal has been finalized, the draft statistics \nlaw will be prepared on the basis of the existing statistical rules and regulations, and the \nstatistical rules and regulations will be modified as necessary. For the statistics aspect, the TA \nwill help upgrade statistics techniques and methodologies for surveys, price indexes, national \naccounts, and data processing. To enhance human resources, the TA will prepare a  human \nresource development plan, and staff will be provided with opportunities for overseas studies, \nOJT and in-county training. The courses of study will be selected in consultation with ADB. The \nTA will consider the  possibility of developing in-country diploma courses for economics and \nstatistics with possible linkage with overseas accredited universities and  institutions. The TA \nactivities will be based on the outcomes of the ADB's previous TAs.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $415,000 equivalent, comprising $354,000 of \nforeign exchange and $61,000 equivalent of local currency cost. ADB will finance $350,000 \nequivalent to cover the foreign exchange cost of $343,000 and $7,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost, on a grant basis from ADB-funded TA program. The Government will fund the \nforeign exchange cost of $11,000 for overseas studies and OJT and the local currency cost of \n$54,000 equivalent for office accommodation, office equipment, counterpart staff, local transport, \nlocal workshops, and other logistical and administrative assistance. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Ministry of Finance and Treasury will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and \nMPND will be the  Implementing Agency. MPND will appoint an appropriate officer as project \ndirector, who will be responsible for the overall TA implementation. The Government's Statistical \nCoordination Committee, chaired by the deputy minister of MPND and attended by all the line \nministries, will oversee TA implementation and resolve any issues related to policies, legislation, \nand interministerial cooperation and coordination. The Attorney General's Office will provide the \nnecessary legal advice and assistance.  \n \n \n ", "4 \n16.  The TA will be carried out with the assistance of international consultants, who will be \nengaged for a total of 9 person-months. Selection and engagement of consultants from a \nconsulting firm will be in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The \ninternational consultants will comprise a (i) statistical capacity  building specialist (3 person-\nmonths) on institutional, legal, and human resource development aspects; (ii) survey and price \nindex specialist (2 person-months), to improve surveys and price indexes; (iii) national accounts \nspecialist  (2  person-months),  to  improve  the  national  accounts  statistics;  and  (iv)  data \nprocessing specialist (2 person-months), to enhance the automation system.  The outline terms \nof reference for consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n17.  The TA is expected to be implemented during a 1 year period, from July 2003 to June \n2004. The core activities that require the consultants' input will be carried out over a 6 month \nperiod, and the overseas studies and OJT will likely be for 1 year with  possible variations \ndepending on the courses selected. The consultants will prepare an inception report within 15 \ndays of their starting work, and an interim report by 2 months from the commencement of their \nservices. The consultants will submit the draft final report to the Government and ADB 3 weeks \nbefore the end of their assignment. The consultants will submit the final report incorporating \ncomments from the Government and ADB within 3 weeks after receiving the comments. The \nGovernment will submit to ADB a supplementary report on the overseas studies and OJT. For \neach repot, five copies will be produced. The outline of the draft final report is in Appendix 4.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of  Maldives for Capacity Building for the National Statistical System, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nIndicators/Targets    and Risks \n   \nGoal       \n    \nTo strengthen the   \nGovernment's capacity for \neconomic and social policy \ndevelopment planning \nthrough enhancing the \neconomic and social data \ncollection system  \n \n \n \nPurpose       \n       \nTo enhance the  The Government's  \u2022  National budgets  \u2022  The Government's \nGovernment's institutional  performance in    commitment to the \nand human capacity to  effectively utilizing the  \u2022  National development  objectives of the \ncollect, consolidate and  enhanced statistical  plans  technical assistance \nanalyze economic and  capacity to formulate its    (TA) project \nsocial data, which will  economic policies and  \u2022  Poverty reduction   \nenable the Government to  disseminate its  strategy paper   \ndevelop more responsive  economic and social   \nand effective economic  data  \u2022  Statistical year book \ngrowth and poverty   \nreduction policies and  \u2022  Quarterly \nprograms  development outlook  \n \n \nOutputs       \n       \n\u2022  A detailed plan for an  \u2022  The Government's  \u2022  Asian Development  \u2022  Insufficient \nindependent  adoption of or  Bank (ADB) review  cooperation within \ndepartment of statistics  commitment to the  missions  the Government  \n  plan and the law      \n\u2022  Draft statistics law and    \u2022  Consultants' reports  \u2022  Shortage of qualified \nrevised statistical rules  \u2022  Implementation of    staff in the \nand regulations  the human  \u2022  ADB's country  Government  \n  resource  economic reviews    \n\u2022  Human resource  development plan    \u2022  Insufficient efforts in \ndevelopment plan     \u2022  Feedback from  technical knowledge \n  \u2022  Publication of the  multilateral financial  transfer from \n\u2022  Sustainable training  GDP statistics with  institutions, bilateral  consultants to \nmechanism   improved quality  agencies and civil  government staff \n  and frequency   society    \n\u2022  Improved gross    \u2022  Ineffective bonding \ndomestic product    arrangements  \n(GDP) statistics  \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nIndicators/Targets    and Risks \n   \nActivities       \n       \n\u2022  Advisory services to  \u2022  Quality of  \u2022  Regular supervision  \u2022  Quality of consultants \ndevelop a plan for an  consultants' inputs  of consultant's inputs  selected \nindependent  in light of the     \ndepartment of statistics   agreed terms of  \u2022  Regular supervision  \u2022  The Government's \n  reference  of the Government's  ability to allocate \n\u2022  Assistance in drafting    counterpart activities  sufficient counterpart \nstatistics law on the  \u2022  The Government's    resource to the TA \nbasis of the existing  commitment to the  \u2022  ADB review missions   \nstatistical rules and  activities, including     \nregulations  the number of staff   \n  allocated and \n\u2022  Assistance in  provision of \ndeveloping a human  counterpart funds  \nresource development   \nplan  \u2022  Timely \n  implementation of \n\u2022  Overseas studies and  overseas studies, \non-the-job training  OJT and in-country \n(OJT) opportunities   training/workshops \n   \n\u2022  In-country  \u2022  Application of \nworkshops/seminars  improved technical \n  methodologies for \n\u2022  Technical advice to  economic statistics  \nimprove statistical   \nmethodologies on   \nsurveys, national   \naccounts, and data \nprocessing \n \n\u2022  Training in statistical \ntechniques \n \nInputs       \n \n\u2022  Consultancy for 9 \nperson-months \n \n\u2022  Overseas studies and \nOJT \n \n\u2022  In-county \ntraining/workshops \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  7 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.
