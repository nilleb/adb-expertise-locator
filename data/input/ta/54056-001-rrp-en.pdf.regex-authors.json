Investment Program Summary\nThe program will increase the renewable energy share by developing private sector-led solar photovoltaic power plants of at \nleast 1,000-megawatt capacity. The innovative application of the partial credit guarantee and the One ADB approach provide a \none-stop shop solution for the government to enable private-funded solar power projects at competitive tariffs and provide lower \nthe cost of electricity to sustain the economic development. The program is expected to be a landmark transaction accelerating \nthe energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables and catalyzing private participation, which can be replicated in other sectors \nand countries.\nImpact: Access to clean, sustainable, an affordable energy supply increased (power sector development plan, 2020-2030) \nOutcome: Private sector-led renewable energy generation increased\nOutputs: (i)Solar power generation capacity increased,  and (ii)Government's capacity for attracting private investment \nstrengthened\nImplementation Arrangements: Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Investment and Foreign Trade (MIFT) will be the executing \nagencies.\nProject Readiness: The program draws on lessons from ADB-funded private sector solar project in Uzbekistan, which \nbenefited from the World Bank's guaranteed letter of credit backed by a credit enhancement product to mitigate NEGU's \nnonpayment risk. The mitigation of the off-taker's payment risks by use of a letter of credit enhanced by international financial \ninstitutions with AAA credit ratings has been proven effective and efficient in facilitating private investments in the unproven \nmarket. This structure can be replicated in the transactions anchored on the long-term revenue contracts or service off-taking \ncontracts, especially when the state off-takers' creditworthiness is weak or unproven in the market.\n9.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Solar Public\u2013Private \nPartnership Investment Program. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a facility \ncomprising partial credit guarantees (PCGs) to enhance the standby letter of credit extended by \na commercial bank to eligible private sector power projects to mitigate the credit risks of the state-\nowned off-taker, Joint-Stock Company National Electric Grid of Uzbekistan (NEGU). \n \n2.  The program will increase the renewable energy share by deploying private sector-led \nsolar  photovoltaic  power  plants  of  at  least  1,000-megawatt (MW)  capacity.  The  innovative \napplication of the PCG and the One ADB approach provide a one-stop shop solution for the \ngovernment to enable private-funded solar power projects at competitive tariffs and lower the cost \nelectricity  to  sustain  economic  development.  The  program  is  expected  to  be  a  landmark \ntransaction accelerating the energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables and catalyzing \nprivate participation, which can be replicated in other sectors and countries. \n \nII.  RATIONALE \n \n3.  As one of the fastest-growing economies in the Central and West Asia region, Uzbekistan \nexperienced  robust  economic  growth  in  2010\u20132014,  averaging  more  than  7%.  However, \nunfavorable external economic environment conditions in 2015, such as declining commodity \nprices and the subdued growth of trading partner countries, slowed economic growth from 6.1% \nin 2016 to 4.5% in 2017. In 2017, the country responded by initiating comprehensive economic \nreforms  to  stimulate  demand,  foster  foreign  investment,  and  develop  the  private  sector. \nUzbekistan has made progress on economic reforms while entrenching macroeconomic stability. \nMajor structural reforms include implementing foreign exchange and tax reforms, improving \nmacro fiscal management, and restructuring state-owned enterprises. Backed by the gains of the \nstructural reforms, Uzbekistan was one of the few countries in the region to record an economic \nexpansion in 2020 despite the impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and an economic \nrebound is expected from 2021 onward.1 \n \n4.  Sector context. Reliable and affordable electricity supply is critical for driving economic \ngrowth and socioeconomic development. The power sector has been run by a state-owned utility \nas a monopoly, Joint Stock Company Uzbekenergo, which undertook the combined functions of \npolicy setting, planning, investment, daily system operations, and regulation. This structure \nincreasingly faced the challenge of meeting fast-growing power demand because of a heavy \nreliance on limited state budget and underinvestment in critical infrastructure. In March 2019, the \ngovernment embarked on comprehensive reforms\u2014starting with creating the Ministry of Energy \n(MOE) as the energy sector ministry, unbundling Uzbekenergo, and liberalizing the market \nstructure\u2014to facilitate competition and direct private investments into the power sector. NEGU \nwas established in this process as a state-owned entity responsible for the transmission system \noperation and the purchase of electricity from all power generation companies. \n \n5.  The financial situation of the power sector has been weakened by significant technical \nlosses, inadequate tariff and unstructured pricing policy, and poor collection rates. While the \ngovernment has continuously rationalized the electricity tariff, with an average adjustment rate of \n5.9% during 2007\u20132018, the average electricity tariff remained at 81% of the cost recovery level \nin  2020.  This  is  largely  cross-subsidized  by  the  below-market  domestic  gas  cost.  Without \n \n1  International Monetary Fund. 2021. Uzbekistan Staff Concluding Statement of the 2021 Article IV Mission. \nWashington, DC. \n ", "2 \nadequate  tariff  adjustments\u2014combined  with  measures  to  reduce  technical  losses,  improve \ncollection rates, and lower generation costs through competitive energy resources\u2014the fiscal gap \nin the sector would widen, requiring substantial subsidies. The lack of creditworthiness of the \nsector limits financing options for the sector, making it completely reliant on limited state budget \nfor major investments. This, in turn, exacerbates underinvestment in the sector. \n \n6.  Access to electricity in Uzbekistan is 100%, but the service quality is poor and unreliable \nbecause of aging infrastructure and inadequate generation capacity. Unreliable power supply has \nnegatively affected people\u2019s livelihoods and businesses\u2019 profitability. More than 32% of firms in \nUzbekistan identify the lack of reliable electricity as a major constraint to doing business and a \ncause of losses, as outages total 3.0% of enterprises\u2019 annual sales, which is worse than the \naverage for Europe and Central Asia.2 Small enterprises suffer more because they cannot afford \nthe expensive diesel backup generators. The government forecasts electricity demand to double \nby 2030, and $26 billion is required to add 17 GW of generation capacity to meet this.3 Attracting \nprivate capital for the adequate investments in the critical infrastructure will be pivotal in resolving \nthis development constraint. \n  \n7.  Uzbekistan generated 63.6 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2019, more than 85% of which \nwas from burning fossil fuels (primarily domestic natural gas). The depleting natural gas resource \nand overdependence on natural gas prompted the country to seek sustainable energy transition \npathways, in which the introduction of renewable energy will reduce demand pressure and \nrationalize gas consumption for electricity.4 Despite rich solar resources across the country, little \nhas been harnessed because of the absence of an integrated energy sector planning and \nenabling regulatory framework for solar development.5 The energy sector is the predominant \nsource of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Uzbekistan. Given Uzbekistan\u2019s commitment to \ncombat climate change under the Paris Agreement and long-term energy security risks, the \npromotion of renewable energy is crucial to avoid fossil fuel and curb GHG emissions while \nmeeting growing energy demand. \n \n8.  Road  map.  In  April  2020,  the  government  adopted  a  2020\u20132030  power  sector \ndevelopment plan. It also lays out a road map to increase the solar generation capacity from a \nnegligible share in 2020 to 5 GW by 2030, accounting for 17% of the total electricity generation, \nand reduce the losses in the transmission and distribution by half to 9% by 2030 (footnote 3). \nUnder this road map, the government approved a medium-term renewable energy investment \nprogram that sets the target to roll out 1.6 GW solar projects by 2025.6 The total investment need \nfor this program is estimated at $1.5 billion. The government aims to raise private financing using \nthe public\u2013private partnership (PPP) model, in particular an independent power producer (IPP) \nscheme where a private entity will generate electricity for sale to the off-taker and recover its \ninvestment and operating costs through the electricity tariff. Based on this, the private entity will \ndesign, finance, build, own, operate, and maintain the solar power plants. The success of IPPs is \nanchored on the long-term tariff payments by the off-taker and the capacity of the government to \nscreen and properly design the IPP contractual structure. \n \n2  World Bank. 2020.

The government requested ADB\u2019s assistance to develop a bankable transaction structure, \ndraw up replicable contract templates, and identify potential project sites for the solar PPP \nprojects. Based on the solar power development road map developed under ADB\u2019s technical \nassistance (TA) and through additional site surveys, multiple promising sites have been identified \nfor further development.7 ADB has been assisting the government in designing and running a \ncompetitive tender process to select a private partner for the first project. Similar competitive \ntendering processes will be conducted for the subsequent tranches with ADB\u2019s TA.

The MOE and NEGU are developing a 10-year transmission development plan with the \nWorld  Bank\u2019s  assistance,  which  will  map  out  the  supporting  transmission  infrastructure \ndevelopment for the evacuation of power from IPPs. Timely development of the adequate \nsupporting transmission infrastructure, to be financed by NEGU and/or the state budget, will \nenable the implementation of a solar investment program. \n \n11.  Policy framework. The government is taking a multifold approach to developing critical \npower infrastructure in Uzbekistan. Its first step was to streamline the policy decision-making and \nintegrate energy planning. In March 2019, the government created the MOE as the main state \nauthority responsible for charting the sector\u2019s policy and development direction. In April 2020, the \ngovernment approved the first long-term sector development plan (footnote 3), which guides \npolicy decisions and promotes a holistic and well-coordinated project selection process. To \nfinance power projects, the government has adopted a hybrid policy combining state budgets for \ntransmission and distribution, and private capital (through PPPs) for power generation and \nrenewable energy. This program will help (i) develop bankable structure replicable for the \nrenewable energy projects and (ii) facilitate the mobilization of private investments by addressing \nthe credit risks of the off-taker, NEGU. \n \n12.  Uzbekistan adopted its first law regulating PPPs, the PPP Law, in June 2019. This is a \nmajor  milestone  in  promoting  PPP  projects  and  attracting  foreign  investments  in  major \ninfrastructure projects. Before this, the first Renewable Energy Law was enacted in March 2019, \nestablishing a sound legal and regulatory framework for investments in renewables. Investors in \nrenewable energy will benefit from concessions to undertake projects; privileges of long-term land \nlease agreements; and government support for certain NEGU obligations, including liquidity \nsupport and termination payments under the power purchase agreement (PPA). These privileges \nare provided up front in the tender packages at the competitive selection process of the private \npartners, and are later embodied in the presidential decrees issued for the respective projects \nand contract documents. The interministerial tender commission, comprising the Ministry of \n \n7  ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Uzbekistan for Solar Energy Development. Manila. \n ", "4 \nFinance (MOF), the Ministry of Investments and Foreign Trade (MIFT), and the MOE, governs \nthe selection of the private partners. Under this policy framework, a transparent selection process, \nstandardized documentation, and support packages will ensure the implementation of the solar \npower development road map (para. 9). \n \n13.  Although  IPPs  have  proved  effective  means  of  bringing  private  capital  into  power \ngeneration, robust creditworthiness of the off-taker and a sustainable market structure are needed \nto guarantee the successful operation of IPPs over 25 years. The government has been rigorously \npursuing reform policies designed to address these, including (i) creation of an autonomous tariff \ncommission, (ii) adoption of a new cost-reflective tariff methodology, (iii) increased revenue \ncollections  through  a  nationwide  advance  metering  program,  and  (iv)  a  stronger  financial \nmanagement system for NEGU. ADB has been playing a leading role along with the European \nBank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank in supporting sector reform with \ntargeted policy-based lending operations, policy dialogues, and TA to improve the financial \nsituation of the sector value chain. This collaborative support will continue to further improve the \nfinancial viability and efficiency of the sector. \n \n14.  The use of PCGs will provide a complementary yet critical layer of confidence to investors \nby mitigating NEGU\u2019s credit risks by ensuring tariff payment. As Uzbekistan\u2019s power sector moves \nforward with its major reform agenda, the government and ADB believe that the application of \nPCGs will provide a signal to international investors of the government\u2019s commitment to stabilizing \nand implementing further reforms. The timely offering of PCGs will (i) attract private investors to \nconsider investing in a country where it might otherwise have been difficult; (ii) promote fair \ncompetition among the potential investors; and (iii) allow potential investors to propose the lowest \npossible tariff, even for NEGU, which has not established a payment track record. Those projects \nincluded in the medium-term renewable investment program, 2021\u20132025 are priority projects \nbenefiting from the incentives extended by the government (para. 12). The policy framework and \nthe road map can appropriately and adequately guide the long-term program of investments. \n \n15.  Strategic context. The main objectives of the government\u2019s sector policy are expanding \ngeneration capacity through renewables, improving security of supply from domestic energy \nresources, and promoting private sector participation. The program is closely aligned with the \ngovernment\u2019s policy directions as well as ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Uzbekistan, \n2019\u20132023, which has the key objective of supporting the country\u2019s movement toward a vibrant \nand inclusive market economy and the transformation of the state\u2019s role.8 The upscaling of \nrenewables is the centerpiece of the implementation of Uzbekistan\u2019s commitment under the Paris \nAgreement and GHG reduction goals set in the Nationally Determined Contributions. The program \nis in line with the strategic direction of the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 by tackling \nclimate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental \nsustainability.9 In building back from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the program \nwill help revive the economy by stimulating private investments at scale in the critical and green \nenergy infrastructure.   \n \n16.  Past assistance and lessons. In 2011, ADB pioneered solar energy development in \nUzbekistan by developing a solar power development road map (footnote 8). However, solar \nenergy development has been stagnant until 2019 because of the monopoly industry structure; \nabsence of an enabling regulatory framework; and the lack of national capacity to develop, \nscreen, and structure privately funded projects. Starting from 2019, ADB\u2019s upstream support for \n \n8  ADB. 2018. Country Partnership Strategy: Uzbekistan, 2019\u20132023\u2014Supporting Economic Transformation. Manila. \n9  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n ", "5 \npower sector reform and policy intervention opened the power market to private investors and \ncreated an investor-friendly environment.10 ADB\u2019s assistance to the national power sector master \nplan  shifted  the  government  energy  policy  direction  toward  upscaling  renewables  and \ndecarbonizing the sector.11 ADB\u2019s downstream support as a transaction advisor to develop a \nbankable transaction structure and replicable templates for the about 1 GW solar PPP investment \nprogram has proven efficient in attracting private investors and lowering stress on the public \nbudget to build large power plants. \n \n17.  The  program  draws  on  lessons  from  ADB-funded  private  sector  solar  project  in \nUzbekistan, which benefited from the World Bank\u2019s guaranteed letter of credit backed by a credit \nenhancement product to mitigate NEGU\u2019s nonpayment risk.12 The mitigation of the off-taker\u2019s \npayment risks by use of a letter of credit enhanced by international financial institutions with AAA \ncredit ratings has been proven effective and efficient in facilitating private investments in the \nunproven market.13 This structure can be replicated in the transactions anchored on the long-term \nrevenue  contracts  or  service  off-taking  contracts,  especially  when  the  state  off-takers\u2019 \ncreditworthiness is weak or unproven in the market. \n \nIII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n18.  The investment program is aligned with the following impact: access to clean, sustainable, \nand affordable energy supply increased (footnote 3). The investment program will have the \nfollowing outcome: private sector-led renewable energy generation increased.14 \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n19.  Output 1: Solar power generation capacity increased. Output 1 will deploy at least \n1,000 MW solar photovoltaic power plants through private sector investments by providing short-\nterm liquidity support backed by PCGs to mitigate NEGU\u2019s off-taker credit risks. The associated \ntransmission infrastructure will be transferred by private investors to NEGU upon construction. \nThe nonphysical output of project 1 will provide vocational training for solar power related \nbusiness start-up and administration to women in the program area. \n \n20.  Output 2: Government\u2019s capacity for attracting private investment strengthened. \nCapacity development under the MFF will consist of (i) development of bankable PPP structure \nand contract templates, (ii) identification and initial due diligence on subsequent projects and \ntendering, and (iii) development of corporate gender policy for NEGU. ADB will provide separate \ntransaction advisory TA to further strengthen the government's capacity in this area.15 \n \n10 ADB. 2020.

Manila. \n13 The International Finance Corporation\u2019s Scaling Solar program widely uses credit enhancement in the form of a \npartial guarantee (World Bank) as part of its packaged deal structure. \n14 The design and monitoring framework for the investment program is in Appendix 1. \n15 This non-physical component will be supported by the technical assistance program to be funded by the Asia Pacific \nProject Preparation Facility for the preparation and due diligence of subsequent tranches, and the ongoing ADB. \n \n ", "6 \n21.  Use of facility. These outputs and outcome are best achieved by an MFF approach \ncomprising a series of PCGs (facility or guarantee facility).16 The facility approach provides long-\nterm and timely support to the government for the phased implementation of the road map. The \nseries of projects with the support of PCG will create interest in quality investors who may not be \ninterested to take the time to bid for one-off projects. This would not only foster competition but \nalso establish a market which could be built-on as NEGU establishes its creditworthiness. All \nprojects supported by the facility will be substantially similar in nature including the project \nstructure, technology, requirements (safeguards and labor), and competitive selection process. \nFramework documents, contract, and procurement templates developed under the MFF will \nefficiently guide the preparation and implementation of subsequent tranches and streamline \nrepetitive administrative process. MFF is best suited for the variability of the time taken for bidding \nprocess, market conditions, and perception of NEGU risk. The competition of the terms (duration \nand payments covered) would be limited with a single guarantee for four projects. Further, \nprovision of a sovereign counter-guarantee by the government is determined project by project \nafter a winning bidder is selected for the respective project, making a single guarantee with \nsovereign counter-guarantee and indemnity for multiple projects infeasible.    \n \n22.  Scope of project 1. Project 1 comprises a standby letter of credit to be issued by a \ncommercial bank and be backed by ADB PCG in connection with the 457-megawatt (MW) solar \nphotovoltaic power plant and associated 50-kilometer (km) 220-kilovolt (kV) transmission line to \nbe constructed in the Sherabad district of Uzbekistan. Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company Public \nJoint Stock Company (Masdar) was selected by the government through international competitive \nbidding supported by ADB at a tariff of $0.018 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for 25 years, demonstrating \nthat the solar photovoltaic plant is the least-cost option in Uzbekistan.17 Project 1 will be the \nlargest solar photovoltaic power plant in the Central Asian region once completed.  \n \n23.  Innovative approaches. In this program, a standby letter of credit provided by a reputable \ncommercial bank will cover the risk if NEGU fails to make timely payments to the IPP up to a \ncertain amount. This affords comfort to investors while allowing for lower exposure to ADB \ncompared with guaranteeing payment for long-term debt. A $40 million guarantee is expected to \ncatalyze more than $1 billion in private investment. The standby letter of credit will be enhanced \nfurther by ADB\u2019s PCG with a sovereign counter-guarantee and indemnity. In case of NEGU\u2019s \ndefault of tariff payment obligations and eventual failure to reimburse the withdrawn amount to \nthe letter of credit issuing bank, the PCG will be called and ADB will reimburse the letter of credit \nissuing bank. ADB can then seek recoveries from the government under the counter-guarantee \nand indemnity agreement. This ADB-guaranteed letter of credit mechanism can be replicated in \nother projects to mitigate the credit risks of state off-takers and facilitate private investments. \n \n24.  ADB value addition. ADB has been supporting the government with upstream policy and \nregulatory reforms and institutional development to create a conducive environment for private \nsector investment. As a transaction advisor, ADB developed bankable transaction structure and \ncontract templates, and assisted the government in site identification and screening, and the \nrunning of a competitive tendering process. ADB\u2019s sovereign credit enhancement instruments \nmitigate the off-taker\u2019s payment risks and thus facilitate private investments in the unproven \nmarket. ADB is considering nonsovereign support as well. The One ADB approach provides an \n \n2019.

Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n25.  The investment program is estimated to cost $1,080 million, including taxes and duties, \nphysical and price contingencies, interest, and other charges during implementation (Table 2). \nDetailed cost estimates by expenditure category are in the facility administration manual (FAM), \nwhich will be financed by a combination of commercial loans and equity contributions to be raised \nby the private partners once selected for the respective projects.18 \n \nTable 2: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

The government has requested ADB financial support under an MFF. The facility will \ncomprise PCGs covering up to an equivalent of $40 million in aggregate principal amount (of \nstandby letter of credit issued by commercial banks) and accrued interest and guarantee fees \nthereon (which are currently estimated at $4 million). Based on the foregoing, ADB\u2019s aggregate \nexposure limit under the facility will be $44 million. The MFF will consist of several tranches, \nsubject to the government\u2019s submission of related periodic PCG requests, execution of the related \ncounter-guarantee and indemnity agreement, project and cooperation agreements for each \ntranche, and the fulfillment of terms and conditions and undertakings set forth in the framework \nfinancing  agreement.  The first tranche  will  comprise  a  PCG that  will  cover  letter  of credit \ndisbursements of up to $10 million plus accrued interest and guarantee fees thereon, estimated \nat $1 million, to cover any failure by NEGU to comply with its payment obligations to the IPP under \nthe PPA for project 1.19 The principal amount is equivalent to an estimate of 3 months of tariff \npayments as well as other expenses and contingencies.  \n \n27.  For each PCG under the MFF, ADB will charge guarantee, commitment and front-end fees \nbased on ADB's loan equivalency pricing for sovereign lending. Each PCG will have a tenor, and \nother  terms  and  conditions  customary  for  such  an  instrument,  subject  to  risk  and  market \nconditions. In the event of nonpayment by NEGU, the letter of credit issuing bank may claim under \nADB\u2019s PCG. ADB will receive a sovereign counter-guarantee and indemnity from Uzbekistan, \nunder which the government will indemnify ADB for any payments made (or any loss incurred) by \nADB under the PCG. A summary financing plan for the program is set out in Table 3.  \n \n18 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Letter of credit will be disbursed in United States dollars. Tariff payment under the PPA will be invoiced in United \nStates dollars by IPPs but payable in sum. NEGU will reconcile the exchange gain or loss in the subsequent invoice. \n ", "8 \nTable 3: Summary Financing Plan \n  Tranche (Estimated Year of PPR Submission)  Amount   Share of \nSource  1 (2021)  2 (2022)  3 (2023)  4 (2024)  ($ million)  Total (%) \nAsian Development Banka   10.0  10.0  10.0  10.0  40.0  87.0 \nGovernment of Uzbekistan  1.5  1.5  1.5  1.5  6.0  13.0 \nTotal  11.5  11.5  11.5  11.5  46.0  100.0 \nPPR = periodic partial credit guarantee request. \na  Actual amount of the partial credit guarantee-backed letter of credit will be sized depending on the needs of the \nindividual tranches. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n28.  Climate financing is estimated to cost up to the whole amount of the PCGs under the \nfacility, mainly for mitigation. Climate adaptation measures will be explored during detailed \nengineering and design. The program is expected to contribute to the reduction of 1,100,000 \nmetric tons of carbon dioxide per annum and project 1 to the reduction of 548,245 metric tons of \ncarbon dioxide per annum.20 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n29.  The  individual  PCGs  under  the  program  will  be  prepared  for  approval  upon  the \ngovernment\u2019s request for PCG. All PCGs provided pursuant to the MFF will be signed and made \neffective during the 5-year MFF availability period from October 2021 to October 2026. 21 The \ntenor of each PCG\u2014which refers to the period during which an LC Issuing Bank may claim under \nthe PCG\u2014will be subject to risk and market conditions at the time of the processing of such PCG, \nprovided that in no event the tenor for any PCG will exceed 25 years from the time of such PCG\u2019s \nissuance.22 The MIFT and MOF will be the executing agencies for the program as the responsible \nauthority for the state investment policy and management of the promotion of foreign investment \nand cooperation between the government and ADB. NEGU will be the implementing agency \nresponsible for ensuring compliance with covenants in favor of ADB under the project-related \nagreements, including the PPA, while the primary responsibility of design, finance, construction, \nownership, and operation will stay with the IPPs. \n \n30.  Implementation arrangements of the investment program are summarized in Table 4 and \ndescribed in detail, including specific arrangements for project 1, in the FAM (footnote 18). \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nMFF availability period  October 2021\u2013October 2026 \nEstimated completion date  October 2026 \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency  Ministry of Investments and Foreign Trade, Ministry of Finance  \n(ii)  Key implementing agency  Joint-Stock Company National Electric Grid of Uzbekistan \nDisbursement  Disbursement under a letter of credit will be subject to terms of the \ncorresponding agreements with the letter of credit issuing bank. ADB\u2019s PCG \nexposure will, at any given time, be in accordance with the terms and \nconditions of the corresponding PCG agreement. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MFF = multitranche financing facility, PCG = partial credit guarantee. \nSource: ADB. \n \n20 Details are in Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 If deemed necessary in order to achieve the development objectives of the investment program, the availability period \nmay be extended up to 10 years from the date of MFF approval. \n22 Based on these arrangements, potential payments by ADB for PCGs provided under the facility may be made up to \nthe end of the tenor of the final PCG approved under the facility. By way of example, if the last PCG under the facility \nis signed and made effective in October 2026, and the tenor of such PCG is 25 years, then ADB will be subject to \npayment obligations under such PCG until October 2051. \n ", "9 \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n31.  Project 1 will be situated in the Sherabad district of Surkhandarya province. Project 1 will \nutilize a proven module technology on a horizontal single-axis mounting structure. These modules \nhave a suitable track record and acceptable market-standard characteristics. The capacity of the \nplant is 457 MW and the estimated average output over its lifetime is equal to 995,000 MW-hours \nper annum. The project will include a new 220 kV substation near the plant and about 50 km of \n220 kV lines to connect to the grid at the Surkhan substation. A grid impact assessment identifies \nno  major  risk  with  the  interconnection  of  the  project  to  the  national  grid.  An  independent \nengineering firm jointly engaged by the project company and NEGU will ensure prudent practices \nare applied and all technical requirements are met. The power plant will be designed and operated \nfor at least 25 years consistent with the term of the PPA. \n \n32.  Masdar was selected by the government as the private sector partner for project 1 through \na competitive tender process assisted by ADB.23 Since its inception in 2006, Masdar has \nsuccessfully developed an aggregate 2.7 GW of renewable energy across 30 countries with a \ncombined investment of $2.7 billion, including an ADB-funded private sector solar project in \nUzbekistan (footnote 12). Masdar is equipped with adequate technical and financial capability to \nimplement project 1. Masdar will incorporate a project company in Uzbekistan that will be \nresponsible for the construction, operation, and maintenance of project 1 during the term of the \nPPA. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n33.  Project 1 is economically viable as demonstrated by its economic internal rate of return of \n18.1% and the net present value of $217.4 million using a 9% discount rate in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects and the Greenhouse Gas Emissions \nAccounting for ADB Energy Project Economic Analysis.24 The main economic benefits relate to \n(i) the meeting of demand growth in the region, (ii) the substitution of electricity generated from \nold gas-fired generation plants, and (iii) the social cost of carbon reduction. Project 1 is also \nfinancially viable as demonstrated by a financial internal rate of return above the project\u2019s \nweighted average cost of capital, based on financial analysis prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \ntechnical guidance note on Financial Analysis and Evaluation.25 The economic and financial \nviability of project 1 would remain satisfactory even under the adverse scenarios of a reduction in \nproject outputs by 16% (based on yield model of 99% probability) and an increase in capital costs \nby 20%. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n34.  Sector governance. The power sector is under the supervision of multiple ministries, \nincluding the MOE, MOF, and MIFT. The energy policy, the long-term sector development plan, \nand reforms are led by the MOE in coordination with other ministries. The MOF manages the \nperformance and sovereign borrowings of the sector state-owned enterprises. The MOF used to \nset  and  adjust  tariffs  and  now  the  interministerial  tariff  council  is  responsible  for  tariff \n \n23 Masdar is indirectly and wholly owned by the Government of Abu Dhabi through shareholdings in Mubadala \nInvestment Company Public Joint Stock Company and Mamoura Diversified Global Holding Public Joint Stock \nCompany. \n24 ADB. 2017.

Once  the  independent  energy  sector  regulator  is  established,  the  tariff \ndetermination function will be transferred to the regulator. The MIFT and MOF are responsible for \nthe monitoring the implementation of the program. Because of the government\u2019s reform efforts, \nsector governance is improving. Institutional capacity development activities for NEGU, such as \nstrengthening  financial  management  capabilities  and  bringing  in  modern  and  transparent \nperformance assessment, are underway with ADB support. \n \n35.  Financial  management.  The  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  of  NEGU  is \nsubstantial. NEGU faces several challenges in the transition to International Financial Reporting \nStandards reporting, including staff training and support, and the development of policies and \nprocedures. There is an urgent necessity to populate the internal audit unit of NEGU and \nstrengthen its role to support business modernization, and budgetary monitoring and information \nprovided to management is relatively weak. More generally, corporate governance needs to be \nenhanced, including the formation of an audit committee, the formation of a risk management \ncommittee, and the development of capacity to produce annual business forecasts covering at \nleast 3 years. ADB\u2019s ongoing project and TA for NEGU will continue to strengthen its financial \nmanagement system.26 \n \n36.  NEGU has generally been operated on a break-even basis. However, the existing power \nmarket structure, where NEGU carries out transmission system operation and wholesale service, \ncreates  significant  operating  risks.  NEGU  is  highly  exposed  to  the  distribution  company\u2019s \ncollection risk, which is better managed with the government\u2019s continued intervention and smart \nmeter. Moreover, an increased share of long-term loans on NEGU\u2019s balance sheet, together with \ncontingent liabilities through the signing of new PPAs, will create a critical need for asset-based \nremuneration to support loan service capacity and liquidity. The government has committed to \ntwo key mitigation measures: (i) roll out the smart metering infrastructure by 2022 and (ii) move \ntoward a full cost-recovery-base tariff by 2023. The government will implement a transmission \ntariff method and improve NEGU\u2019s operational efficiency and financial condition, including a \nseparation of the wholesale service from the transmission system operations. The risk of a call \non the PCG is assessed to be moderate after these mitigation measures. \n \n37.  Procurement.  All  procurement  supported  by  the  facility  will  conform  to  the  ADB \nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB \nBorrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n38.  Integrity  due  diligence  was  conducted  on  NEGU  and  the  members  of  its  board  of \ndirectors.27 They do not appear to constitute a significant or potentially significant integrity risk, \nsince no unresolved or substantiated adverse media or other relevant information related to them \nexists. ADB has obtained reasonable assurance that NEGU was not established and is not being \nused for money laundering or terrorism financing in the project jurisdiction. \n \n39.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and NEGU.

The ultimate project beneficiaries will be the general population and \nindustries in Uzbekistan since the solar power plant will provide electricity to the national grid. \nReliable and affordable grid-connected electricity will positively affect local business development \nand the delivery of services by schools, clinics, and local governments, which ultimately will \nimprove the quality of life. No potential constraints to access the services have been identified. \nSecondary beneficiaries will include the population around the project site. Many unskilled jobs \nfor the local population can be created during construction, while a few skilled jobs can be created \nin organizations providing operation and maintenance services for the solar power plant. A \nsignificant  indirect  effect  on  the  population  is  wider  employment  and  self-employment \nopportunities in such sectors of the economy as catering and services. \n \n41.  Gender.  The  program  is  categorized  some  gender  elements.  Women  are \nunderrepresented in Uzbekistan\u2019s energy sector mostly because of lack of necessary education, \nlack of awareness of employment options, limited opportunities for skills development, and \nprevailing stereotypes that regard the energy sector as a high-risk profession not suitable for \nwomen.  Key  gender  actions  include  (i)  strengthening  NEGU\u2019s  gender-responsive  human \nresources policy, (ii) promoting skills development in developing and structuring energy PPP \nprojects, and (iii) conducting vocational trainings for start-up and administration in the project area \nin relation to the solar power projects. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n42.  All  projects  will  be  classified  individually  and  category  A  projects  for  environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples will not be qualified under the program. An \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  and  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nframework (LARF), which provide guidance on safeguard due diligence to be undertaken for each \nproject to be proposed under the program, were prepared. ADB disclosed these frameworks on \nits website in May 2021.28 The government and NEGU have committed to implement, and cause \nthe  project  company  to  implement,  the  safeguards  requirement  as  per  the  environmental \nassessment and review framework and LARF. \n \n43.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the safeguard categories \nof project 1 are as follows.29 \n \n44.  Environment (category B). Given the construction of solar photovoltaic power plant and \ntransmission line, the potential direct, indirect, cumulative, and induced impacts for project 1 are \nanticipated to be of minor magnitude, site-specific, generally reversible, and readily mitigated. \n \n45.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) report for project 1 was cleared by ADB in 2020 \nand disclosed on ADB\u2019s website in April 2021. The IEE was prepared for 200 MW capacity of \nsolar photovoltaic power generation while 457 MW was proposed afterward (footnote b of Table \n1). The NEGU prepared an addendum to the IEE that confirms that the 457 MW solar plant will \nbe constructed within the area of assessment of the original IEE. The addendum also proposes \nsome additional mitigation measures to accommodate the increased capacity. The addendum \nwas disclosed on ADB\u2019s website in June 2021. Public consultations were conducted for the \n \n28 NEGU. 2021.

Safeguard Categories. \n ", "12 \nnearest communities at the initial scoping stage. Environmental impacts that could occur during \nconstruction will be temporary, localized, and moderate impacts (i) within the solar plant site and \non the corridors of the transmission line and access roads; and (ii) on nearby villages such as \nincreased noise, dust levels, vibration, and traffic congestion. There will be minor impacts during \noperation, such as water usage for solar panel cleaning and waste management. The change in \nlandscape features and visual impacts will have moderate impacts, while the remaining residual \nimpacts are of low significance. The site is located in a modified habitat. A critical habitat status \nis recognized for the southern even-fingered gecko (Alsophylax laevis), which is considered \ncritically endangered.30 Some endangered bird species also occur, although none of the species \nmeet the threshold requirements for critical habitat. A biodiversity monitoring and evaluation plan \nand a biodiversity action plan, which were prepared as part of the IEE, will be implemented. \n \n46.  Masdar, its project company (para. 32), and contractors will conduct COVID-19 risk \nassessment for the project, and measures to mitigate COVID-19 health risks will be integrated \ninto the contractor\u2019s occupational health and safety plans. \n \n47.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). For project 1, the land plot available for the solar \nphotovoltaic plant and a new substation is about 600 hectares (ha). The site is mostly barren land \nsurrounded by irrigation canals and there are no houses or other residential and commercial \nstructures around the location for the solar plant. A social safeguards due diligence report \ndisclosed in April 2021 indicates that the solar plant and its substation will not require land \nacquisition and will not cause any economic or physical displacement to nearby residents. The \nland is fully owned by the government and will be made available to the project company through \na land lease agreement for a duration equal to the term of the PPA. \n \n48.  The 50 km overhead transmission lines will mostly follow the right-of-way along the \nexisting transmission lines. An assessment of the tentative route of the overhead transmission \nlines based on preliminary design indicates that 57 privately used land plots and 9 agricultural \ncompanies may permanently lose 12.96 ha. Another 117.79 ha of their land may be temporarily \naffected during construction. No physical displacement is expected, and all affected persons will \nonly lose marginal portions of their agricultural land. To the extent feasible, the route will be altered \nto avoid adverse impacts on privately used land and other assets. Upon completion of the detailed \ndesign and finalization of the route, the project company will submit to ADB for approval an \nimplementation-ready  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP)  following  the  LARF. \nCommencement  of  civil  works  for  the  transmission  line  will  be  conditional  to  the  full \nimplementation of the LARP. The LARP will be implemented following national legislation and \nregulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n49.  Indigenous  peoples (category  C).  The  project  does  not  have  indigenous  peoples \nimpacts as defined by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Therefore, the indigenous peoples \nsafeguard is not triggered. \n \nF.
