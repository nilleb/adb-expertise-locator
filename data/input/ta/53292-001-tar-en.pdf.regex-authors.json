The transaction TA facility will provide project preparation support to ongoing and ensuing \nmandates, covering 42 projects in developing member countries (DMCs) across different sectors, \nlisted below. These mandates will require conduct of technical, financial, economic, and legal, \nfiscal and operational due diligence to assess bankability and structure the project for private \nsector investment. \n1.

The provision of ADB transaction advisory service in the DMCs mentioned above is \nexpected to increase private sector participation in the provision of infrastructure assets and \nservices. Under Strategy 2030, ADB will expand its support for PPPs by providing transaction \nadvisory services largely through OPPP and assisting in project development, structuring, and \npreparation. As a project developer, ADB will scale up its transaction advisory services to help \nmany public sector clients structure PPPs and develop robust and bankable project pipelines.  \n \n3.  As of 30 June 2019, OPPP is implementing 11 mandates in energy, health, transport and \nurban sectors and has successfully closed four transaction advisory mandates. OPPP is actively \npursuing mandates in several DMCs and is expected to secure three new mandates annually until \n2021. \n \n4.  Development of the above projects are in line with ADB Strategy 2030, which promotes \ninfrastructure  investments  in  transport,  energy  and  urban  development,  and  encourages \ninterventions in social sectors, such as education and health. The above projects are also in line \nwith sectoral priorities of each of the DMC\u2019s Country Partnership Strategies (CPS) / Country \nOperations Business Plans (COBP). \n ", " \n5.  Processing a TRTA for several projects is preferred against processing various individual \nTRTAs as this reduces the administrative burden of processing multiple TAs and allows flexibility \nto readily draw on funds as soon the need arises for any of the projects covered. OPPP prefers \nto avoid the situation wherein TA funds are tied up with projects that are delayed and cannot be \nused for other projects that already need funding.  \n ", "7   \n \nOutputs and Activities  \n \n6.  Output  1:  Advisory  services  for  the  preparation  and  structuring  of  bankable  PPP \ntransactions provided. Output 1 will include conduct of technical studies to provide information \nneeded to finalize the technical parameters of the project and project agreements and address \nkey obligations of the government under the agreements. Specific studies will be determined \nbased on the underlying transaction. This will also include provision of financial and economic \nanalysis support to DMCs, including value-for-money analysis, fiscal risk assessments, a financial \nmodel prepared in support for the proposed transaction structure, shadow bid models, and a final \nfinancial model that integrates the risk positions and financial structure of the project agreed \nbetween the government and the preferred bidder. In addition to development of these models, \nfinancial analysis support also includes review of the preferred bidder\u2019s financial model and other \nfinancial analysis tasks as may be required for a transaction. \n \n7.  Output 2: Project marketing support provided. This may include provision of support to \nDMCs to retain providers of transaction support services, including but not limited to, translation \nservices, data room management, organizing bidder conferences and other events, developing \nmarketing materials, and advertising transactions through international media outlets. \n \n8.  Output 3: Support to drafting of project agreements and managing the bidding process \nprovided. The TA will assist ADB in the conduct of a legal due diligence and ensure that \nappropriate legal inputs (from both international law and local law perspectives) are identified and \nincorporated  in  the  project  agreements,  and  that  the  content  and  structure  of  the  project \nagreements are consistent with best international standards. Project agreements are expected to \ninclude a concession agreement and other supporting agreements as required by the particular \nproject  or  sector.  Assistance  and  advice  will  also  be  provided  to  the  government  during \nnegotiations with the bidders.  \n \n9.  Other support as needed. In addition to the forms of support mentioned above, the \nspecifics of a transaction may require specialist inputs in areas including insurance, tax, geology, \nenvironment, social safeguards, independent audit of financial models, and other specialist inputs \nas may be required for a transaction.  \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $5.00 million, of which $3.08 will be financed from \nTASF 6 and $1.92 will be financed from TASF-Others. The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 1. The TA facility will be subject to arrangements that will seek partial recovery of the \namount financed under the TA facility. Terms of recovery are negotiated and vary for each project. \nAside from a success fee upon achieving commercial close, there could also be a partial recovery \nupon achieving certain milestones (e.g. delivery of a due diligence report). \n \n11.  The government may provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace, and other support, as articulated in the TAS agreement between ADB and the relevant \ngovernment agency. The government will be informed that approval of the TA does not commit \nADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The TA activities for an ensuing mandate will start only after the TAS mandate letter has \nbeen signed between ADB and the client government.  \n ", "8   \n \n13.  ADB will be the executing and implementing agency of the TA. The TA will finance \nconsulting services, workshop and training events, including study visits and resource persons; \npreparation of reports as well as communication, miscellaneous administration and support costs.  \n \n14.
