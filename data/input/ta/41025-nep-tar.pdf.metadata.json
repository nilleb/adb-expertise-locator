During  the  discussions  for  the  Country  Operations  Business  Plan  2007\u20132009,  the \nGovernment of Nepal requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to enhance private sector participation (PSP) in Nepal\u2019s power sector. ADB conducted a \nfact-finding  mission  21\u201326  September  2007  and  reached  an  understanding  with  the \nGovernment  on  the  TA\u2019s  objective,  scope,  cost  estimates,  financing,  implementing \narrangements, and consultants\u2019 terms of reference. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.1   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  for  Nepal  addresses  poverty  reduction  through  sustainable \neconomic  growth,  social  development,  good  governance,  environmental  management,  and \nprivate sector development. In particular, hydropower development for export can play a vital \nrole in generating employment and supporting income growth, human resource development, \ncapacity building, and sustainable management of natural resources.  \n \n3.  Nepal\u2019s power sector is characterized by undelivered potential, as estimates place its \ncommercially exploitable hydropower potential at around 43,000 megawatts (MW). A significant \neconomic opportunity for Nepal exists in electricity export, especially in the context of the South \nAsia region, which possesses a net power deficit. In particular, India\u2019s ever-growing demand for \npower means that it could be a major purchaser of power from its neighboring countries. \nHowever, this potential remains largely untapped, and Nepal is a net importer of electricity from \nIndia\u2014during the December 2006 winter peak, Nepal imported peak power of 94 MW from India. \n \n4.  Government  resources  in  Nepal  are  not  available  to  finance  large  export-oriented \nhydropower projects or those for its power-deficit domestic market. For this reason, PSP is an \nintegral part of the Government\u2019s development framework to achieve its medium- and long-term \neconomic growth and poverty reduction objectives. PSP will facilitate Nepal earning foreign \nexchange from electricity exports while addressing the domestic power deficit. In addition, a \nmajor increase in fiscal revenue will fund service delivery and basic infrastructure in the fields of \nhealth, education, and other social sectors.  \n \n5.  With a view to unlock the power sector\u2019s potential, the Government has taken some \nsteps to attract private investment. However, with the exception of some run-of-river hydropower \nplants funded by domestic investors, little private investment has occurred. Reasons include (i) \nlack  of  transparency  and  accountability  in  the  licensing  process,  (ii)  incompatibilities  and \ninconsistencies  in  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks,  (iii)  difficulties  in  raising  non-recourse \nfinance,  (iv)  issues  over  the  transparency  of  buy-back  rates  for  hydropower  projects,  (v) \ninadequate transmission and distribution networks to evacuate and deliver power, (vi) lack of \ncogent power export policy, and (vii) political risk. \n \n6.  Build-own-operate-transfer is the main modality used for power generation. The main \nrational for adopting this approach in hydropower is that the hydropower resource, e.g., the river \nsite, should not be given to a private party in perpetuity. Leasing is another modality being used \nfor PSP; however, as a modality, it has limited appeal as it does not remove the Government\u2019s \nburden  to  provide  capital  for  investment.  Therefore,  consideration  must  be  given  to  other \nmodalities,  such  as  license  renewal  granted  on  a  performance  basis,  which  would  give \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 16 October 2007. \n ", "2   \nindependent power producers and developers an added incentive to invest further in the asset \nand maintain it during the initial licensing period. \n \n7.  The Government currently proposes a provision for the licensing of transmission lines on \nthe principle of build-own-operate (BOO) for 30 years with a condition to renew the license. \nConsideration is also being given to applying this modality to power distribution, particularly in \nurban areas. Under the BOO modality, the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) or a successor \ncompany would continue to build distribution networks and then lease them out on an operating \nbasis  to  private  entities.  The  local  distribution  networks  would  be  leased  out  to  \ncommunity-based organizations, as is already occurring through NEA\u2019s Community and Rural \nElectrification Department. \n \n8.  The power sector, with its significant potential to contribute to economic development, \nmust  be  effectively  managed  to  maximize  its  role  in  poverty  reduction.  To  this  end,  the \nGovernment recognizes that it should focus on planning, structuring, and regulation while the \nprivate sector should specialize in investment, construction, financing, and management. In \naddition, because PSP is needed to meet the power sector\u2019s critical need for rehabilitation and \nexpansion, the Government must improve the existing framework to encourage PSP toward \nsustainable sector development. The institutional arrangements for designing, implementing, \nand managing the public\u2013private partnerships (PPP) and suitable PPP modalities must be \nreexamined. \n \n9.  The challenge for the Government is to ensure that PSP in the power sector leads to \nefficient  sector  development.  For  this  objective,  it  intends  to  review  existing  policies  and \nregulations and to introduce new legislation to create and maintain an enabling environment for \nPSP. The Government has requested ADB assistance in this regard.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.   The TA will assist the Government in (i) formulating investor-friendly PSP policy, (ii) \nenforceable regulations that will be tailored to the market\u2019s needs, and (iii) building capacity to \ndesign and appraise PSP. As a result, increased PSP in the power sector will facilitate efficient \nsector development. Nepal will earn foreign exchange from electricity exports and address the \ndomestic power deficit. In return, a major increase in fiscal revenue will fund service delivery \nand basic infrastructure augmentation.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n11.   Specific outputs expected from this TA include: \n \n(i)  a  PSP  framework  for  domestic  and  export-oriented  hydropower  projects, \nidentifying institutional responsibilities and the basis for seeking PSP;  \n(ii)  a set of draft PPP competitive bidding guidelines for approval by the sector\u2019s \nregulator, including draft standard PPP bidding documents, pro forma requests \nfor proposals, and requests for quotations for competitive bidding processes; \n(iii)  capacity building and training and workshops in bid process management, PSP \npolicy framework, and the requirements for successful implementation of private \nsector investments; and \n ", "  3\n(iv)  A  methodology  for  environmental  impact  assessment  of  private  sector \nhydropower projects. \n \nC.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.   The TA will review the legislative and regulatory environment for PSP and assess the \ncurrent  status  of  PSP  in  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution.  It  will  then  create  a \ncomprehensive  PSP  framework  in  domestic  and  export-oriented  hydropower  projects, \nidentifying  institutional  responsibilities  and  the  basis  for  seeking  PSP.  It  will  recommend \nchanges to legislative, regulatory, and procedural PSP frameworks and processes, and assist \nthe Government with their implementation. It will also assist in the promotion of specific PSP \nopportunities, the preparation of tender documents, and the evaluation of tenders.  \n \n13.   Key activities will include:  \n \n(i)  reviewing and analyzing current obstacles to PSP; \n(ii)  providing and analyzing PPP models in terms of risk mitigation and cost sharing; \n(iii)  recommending  revisions  and  updates  of  policies,  legislation,  and  regulations \nrelated to PSP; \n(iv)  proposing institutional arrangements for designing, implementing, and managing \nthe PPPs; \n(v)  capacity building and guidance to Department of Electricity Development (DOED) \nstaff and relevant stakeholders, through on-the-job training and workshops, on \nPSP  policy  frameworks  and  the  requirements  for  successful  promotion  and \nimplementation of private investment projects in the power sector; \n(vi)  preparing draft competitive bidding guidelines for approval by the sector regulator, \nincluding draft standard bidding documents for competitive bidding processes, \npro forma requests for proposals, and requests for quotations;  \n(vii)  training the Government in bid process management, including preparation of \ntender documents, evaluation of tenders, and negotiation of contracts for specific \nPSP projects; \n(viii)  reviewing relevant environmental legislation, and outlining a methodology for \nundertaking strategic environmental assessment of energy sector programs that \nwould facilitate meaningful stakeholder participation and interaction; and \n(ix)  assisting  the  Government  in  preparation  of  tender  documents,  evaluation  of \ntenders, and negotiation of contracts for specific PSP projects.  \n \n14.   No major risks are associated with the TA, and the Government has expressed its strong \nsupport.  \n \nD.  Cost and Financing \n15.   The total cost of the TA is estimated at $700,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $600,000 \non a grant basis from ADB's TA funding program. The Government will finance the remaining \n$100,000 equivalent in-kind through the provision of office space, office equipment, and local \ntransportation in Kathmandu. The details of cost estimates are in Appendix 3. \n \n ", "4   \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.   The Executing Agency (EA) will be the Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR), which will \nestablish a steering committee consisting of senior staff from the Ministry of Finance and \nMOWR. The committee will meet on a quarterly basis to oversee TA activities. DOED will be the \nImplementing Agency, which will appoint a senior staff member as the project director. In \naddition, a project management office will be established in DOED, which will be responsible for \nthe  day-to-day  management  of  the  TA  and  coordination  with  all  government  and \nnongovernment stakeholders. This office will also oversee consultants\u2019 activities and facilitate \nADB\u2019s TA administration.  \n \n17.   The EA and DOED will provide (i) office accommodation and facilities, Internet access, \nand secretarial support; and (ii) land transportation within Nepal for consultants. The EA, DOED, \nand other agencies concerned will also provide the consultants with existing data, preliminary \nanalysis, and reports, and will guide consultants in data collection through liaising with other \nministries and agencies. MOWR, DOED, other relevant agencies, and consultants will jointly \norganize dissemination workshops for counterpart staff and other stakeholders. The EA will \nensure close coordination with consultants of various ongoing TAs of ADB or other development \npartners and will incorporate lessons from past TAs of ADB and other development partners in \nthe power sector. The consultants will organize workshops, seminars, and meetings to brief \nstakeholders and receive feedback on the policy update, PPP guidelines, and the proposed \nPPP models in collaboration with ADB, MOWR, and DOED. The consultants will be accountable \nto both ADB and the EA. \n \n18.   The  TA  will  finance  the  services  of  international  consultants  for  a  total  of  17  \nperson-months and national consultants for a total of 17 person-months. A consulting firm or \nconsortium of firms will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Recruitment of consultants will be under the \nquality- and cost-based selection process, and simplified technical proposals will be requested. \nA standard quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20 will be used.  \n \n19.   The TA will commence in March 2008 and will be completed by the end of July 2009. \nThe  international  consulting  team  will  consist  of  the  following  experts:  (i)  power  sector \ndevelopment expert, (ii) project financing expert, and (iii) institutional development expert. They \nwill be supported by a national consulting team consisting of (i) legal counsel, (ii) power sector \ndevelopment specialist, and (iii) environmental specialist. The outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n20.   The consultants will prepare monthly status reports for their specific scope of work, \nhighlighting  any  issue  that  could  become  critical  for  the  TA\u2019s  timely  implementation  and \ncompletion.  An  inception  report,  which  summarizes  the  current  obstacles  to  PSP,  and  a  \ntime-bound action plan, which details recommendation to overcome these obstacles, will be \nsubmitted 2 weeks after the commencement of their services. The inception report will also \ninclude the consultants\u2019 proposed action plan. An interim report will be submitted within 6 \nmonths after inception, and a draft final report will be submitted within 10 months after inception. \nThe first tripartite meeting in Kathmandu between the Government, ADB, and consultants will \nreview the inception report within 3 weeks of receiving it. An interim report will describe the TA\u2019s \nprogress, person-months utilized, problems encountered, and proposed revision of the work \nplan, and will incorporate detailed reports on completion of the current policy analysis. A draft \nfinal report will detail consultants\u2019 findings and recommendations. The second tripartite meeting \nwill review the interim report, and the third tripartite meeting will review the draft final report. The \n ", "  5\nconsultants will organize (i) two workshops after the second and third tripartite meetings to brief \nstakeholders and receive their feedback on the policy update, PPP guidelines, and models; and  \n(ii) a seminar at the conclusion of the TA to disseminate the findings. The final report will be \nsubmitted within 4 weeks after the tripartite review of the draft final report.  \n \n21.   The  power  sector  development  expert  will  assist  the  Government  in  preparation  of \ntender documents, evaluation of tenders, and negotiation of contracts for specific PSP projects \non an intermittent basis; therefore, this expert\u2019s responsibilities will continue after the final report. \nThe power sector development expert will maintain monthly reporting on his/her activities until \nthe completion of the TA. \n \nIV.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  The ADB Country Strategy and Program for Nepal addresses poverty reduction through sustainable economic growth, \nsocial development, good governance, environmental management, and private sector development. In particular, hydropower \ndevelopment for export will play a vital role in achieving the Government\u2019s goals to generate employment and support income \ngrowth, human resource development, capacity building, and sustainable management of natural resources.  \n \nTo date, however, the potential remains largely untapped, and Nepal is a net importer of electricity from India\u2014during the \nDecember 2006 winter peak, Nepal imported peak power of 94 MW from India. \n \nGovernment resources are not available to finance large export-oriented hydropower projects. PSP will facilitate Nepal earning \nforeign exchange from electricity exports, which will provide a major increase in the fiscal revenue needed to fund service \ndelivery and basic infrastructure in the fields of health, education, and other social sectors.  \n \nB.

Explain the basis for the targeting classification:   \nThis TA will assist the Government in formulating investor-friendly PSP policy and enforceable regulations that will be tailored \nto the market\u2019s needs. PSP will be increased in Nepal\u2019s power sector, and this will facilitate the efficient development of the \npower sector. No direct impact on poverty is foreseen. \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? This is not a PPTA. \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)?  \nImpacts on the poor are expected in the long term, as the Government will benefit from increased capacity. This will facilitate \nthe efficient development of the power sector and will benefit different sectors of society. In particular, the poor will benefit \ndirectly as they will have access to more reliable electricity, and indirectly as the economy will increase its productivity and \nbetter social infrastructure. \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject?  \nThe Government is the primary beneficiary of the project.
